2WoUvFUJaa	You could very well be pregnant. You could try taking a test now. I suggest First Response. It is a good detector for early pregnancy, cheap, and you can usually get multiple test for under ten bucks so that if you are too early you can try again in a few days. Best of luck to you. I hope that you get the baby it sounds like you have been trying so long and hard for. If this isn't your month, my advice is to stop trying so hard. My husband and I tried for 6 months with our daughter and the one month we stopped trying so hard, we ended up pregnant. Good luck and I hope you are blessed soon.|`|hoX7hoINaa	I noticed only a slight increase and no bloating (which I usually got before my period) I recommend using www.mymonthlycycle.com for help with conceiving. After figuring out a few months of my cycle, I noticed a pattern of my most fertile time and found myself pregnant a few months after signing up! Its free and a big help. Good Luck!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	i noticed i had more discharge and my boobs were swollen looking and very sore (not a normal pms symptom for me)so i tested and it was positive! so i think you may very well be pregnant!
3Q9yiimsaa	Make sure you are drinking plenty of water. It could just be Braxton Hicks but again it could be real contractions. You need to start timing them to find out how close they are together and how long they last for. A great thing to use is contractionmaster.com it is a great tool that will help you time then and if they are 5-10 mins apart and are lasting longer then 30 seconds i would call your doctor.|`|ioZeveazaa	It could possibly be braxton hicks however you do need to call your doctor and inform him of what you are feeling. If the pain continues for the next three hours and doesn't subside and gets worse then go to the ER because it could be labor. Good luck!|`|dSrJwJDoaa	call your doctor or eat something you normally eat.|`|AA11208683	i would call your doctor right away just to make sure that they know whats going on... it could be braxton hicks, but if it doesn't go away with resting or taking a shower or even eating or drinking, then its not braxton hicks and you should call the doctor right away. Braxton hicks most of the time you feel them start on the upper part of your stomach not the lower. and if it is accompanied by lower back ache then your probably going in to labor. i would call the doctor just to be on the safe side.... GOOD LUCK!|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Any type of pain should be told to your doctor. It sounds like you are in labor. When I was pregnant I felt constipated all day long and crampy down low. My mom said how close are these little pains of yours and they were like 10 minutes apart and she said we are going. I was 7 months along.. We get to the hospital and my mom did not even have enough time to drink a cup of coffee, I already had my baby girl.<br>  You best call your doctor or go to the hospital because it is scary having a baby at home and it is best to be sure, even if you aren't in labor.|`|qahWKWmuaa	is your sister a doctor ? <br>  no? <br>  well then go to the doctors they most likely are contractions and i know its a pain in the butt but better safe than sorry|`|claUGpVRaa	You are possibly in labour so call the labour ward and describe your symptoms.|`|ZMnD5s7laa	she's right it very well could be, but at the same time it seems more likely that your having contractions. If this is your first child then dont' worry or stress becasue most women's first labor goes hours so its not like your in a rush to the hospital to deliver just yet. If your able to talk through your pain then moer than likely your not in contraction BUT there are some women who can handle pain more than others. Your best bet is to go ahead and say your having contractions. Try, if you can, get thigns together for the doctor such as what your going to wear while in delivery and snacks extra clothes, etc... Move slowly and easy. If your sister is going to be home, i'd say within the next hour, then you both go to the doctor. Call a friend or another family member in the mean time incase the pains increase and you can't wait, or if it's too long waiting on her. If for any reason you have no one else, call the hospital and say you think your in contractions or labor andneed to speak to yoru docotor. You may be asked to go in- if no one is able to take you call the ambulance to take you. Good luck with your new baby and hope all goes well|`|bzQNHfunaa	im 37 wks today and since i was 29 wks have had bh contractions, sum hurt sum come and go...1st relax honey when that baby wants to make his/her appearance they will come! 2ndly try drinking a full glass (8oz) of water or tea.. no soda..even juice would wk...and lay down on left side..try and do this for a couple hrs..try and take a nap, u might have been up on ft t2 long. if after that they dont stop or get worse call ur dr cuz u be in labor lady!! :)|`|UYaWH7a0aa	You should really call your doctor that has been seeing you throughout your pregnancy, explain your pains and take their advice - they know you, your body and your pregnancy the second best after yourself.
NGz7R9enaa	First of all calm down and try to eat something. No matter what, the little one inside of you did not ask for any of this, remember that. Talk to someone you trust and take all the help you can. What he did is not right, but it is not the end of the world.|`|12WCb61zaa	Well for one if you plan on having this baby, you need to eat and remember that you have another life growing inside of you. Talk to him and ask him why he just wants to be friends. Or is he trying to escape from his responsibilities?|`|0wdEcNk1aa	As this is his first child, I have a feeling he is going through pre-fatherhood jitters. Dry your eyes and tell him that is just fine, you can be friends. But also tell him that you will expect him to be responsible for his child. Let him know that the important thing is that he know and bond with his child and that you will help him do that. But also that you will expect him to share the responsibilities of parenthood. Be calm, be firm. He doesn't get a pass on this child any more than you do!|`|olopisx7aa	You need some good friends to cry on their shoulder and you need all the support you can get. I'm sorry about what happened. You will grow stronger with time and best of luck. Make sure he pays child support though.|`|iV3d88Evaa	tell him how u feel. tell him you need him around for the baby. tell him not to leave you when your carrying one of his kids. tell him hes an asshole for wanting to abandon you, tell him everything
Xc02z608aa	Pampers Swaddlers|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I prefer cloth, but I also use Pampers.<br>  <br>  With my older two, now 11 and 8 so it has been a while ago, were babies, we tried Huggies with the first and they leaked horribly.  I called and complained, and they told me it must have been a defective batch and sent me coupons for several more packs.  We tried them, problem persisted, so we donated those diapers and never used Huggies on her again.  We got a lot of Huggies when my son was born, with gifts, and even though it was a couple of years later, the problem persisted.  My youngest is now 17 months old and we have never even tried Huggies this time around.<br>  <br>  Cloth is wonderful, and we have never had problems with Pampers.|`|zATQaiwIaa	pampers swaddlers!  <br>  Never buy Huggies - every single time i was given one they leaked!|`|OgzHcNMsaa	Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive!

Now we're using the gdiaper and absolutely love them.  their smallest size is for 8 lb though. so you would still have to use some type of newborn diaper.  but really i have a lot less leakage than before and so far for over 4 months we've had only one blow out and he had really bad diarrhea that time.|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	get the pampers swaddlers but the ones with the yellow line down the front. it turns blue when baby pees.|`|WThYT17Iaa	Pampers. We used huggies for a while but realised that there was a size difference.

The hospital sent me home with Huggies, so I used then only to not waste them, and they just didn't seem as soft as the Swaddlers.  The Huggies didn't leak or anything like that, they just seemed rough.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i like pampers <br>  but i end up using what ever is on sale at BJS and i have a coupon for the most money off on wich is usually luvs <br>  and boy do they hold alot of pee you should see how full my sons diaper is in the morning and it does not leak <br>  <br>  i also like target brand|`|1ezYfkX7aa	The pampers swaddlers.

382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	For me personally, I would have to say my husband by far.<br>  I find it quite easy to be a stay at home mum, I don't find it stressful or hard at all. Quite enjoyable actually.<br>  However, I do know mums who find it hard. I guess it depends on the child's personalities.<br>  Then it also depends I guess, on the actual job of the bread winner. Some have hard jobs, others aren't so much.|`|4FQKWxB9aa	That's a tough one, because I have a lot of stress & I am home more,  But he works hard & pays the bills, buys food, pays the property taxes, things like that, that i don't have to worry about, I would have to say I have it a bit easier, because I get to spend quality time with our children everyday, even though it's tough & gets old after a while,  He has to make sure we have everything & money for everything we need...... I think he has a much harder/stressful job.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	It depends on how difficult the money-maker's job is, versus how well the children at home behave... And, whether or not the children are in school.<br>  <br>  I homeschool my older two, who are 11, and almost 10... I also have an almost-2-year-old, and a 4 month old... It can be very difficult and stressful, but I know my husband works hard, too, and gets up early to be able to provide for us. It shouldn't be a matter of "I have it worse than you do!" "No, *I* do!" as we each contribute, to keep things running. :)<br>  <br>  *edited* As far as stress, I would say I have it harder... If I'm in a bad mood, it will show, and I have the kids to think about... If my husband is in a bad mood, his co-workers don't notice or care (or they pretend not to!)...  My kids are at very different stages, which can definitely make things tricky.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Both are stressful and hard in their own ways.  I work, my husband is a SAHD.  I have the stress of being the only income in this terrible economy.  My job (I am at a Director level) can also be stressful in itself and some days downright tiring.<br>  <br>  My husband works his butt off taking care of our 11 month old, doing the chores, laundry, cooking, etc.  It can also be stressful on him to be home most of the day without a moment to himself where he's not "on call".<br>  <br>  I think both are equally important and have their good and bad days...|`|AA12145826	Ok I'll be honest, my first reaction to that question is: That's Not Fair!! They both work equally hard at equally different and difficult tasks!!<br>  <br>  So I'll say both. :o)|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'd have to say that they both have equally stressful jobs.. Sometimes the home maker has more fun in her "job" though!|`|jdRKZe18aa	The bread winner or the bread maker??? : )<br>  Most definately the MOM - we work 24/7 with no vacation pay, no incentive plan, little to no appreciation, recognition, no breaks, no sick time, NO PAY, no overtime, no assistant(s) or secretary, no sleep, no naps, NO STOPPING ever!!!  <br>  HOW could that not possibly be the hardest most stressful job in the WORLD?|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It depends on the bread winner's job duties but for me personally it would be harder to be the home maker.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	It depends on what they both do. If they have 1 child who is off at school most of the time. Probably the bread winner. If they have a bunch of little children running around then, the home maker more likely. It also depends on the bread winners job if it very demanding, so it really all depends on each family.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Depends on the family--just bc you earn a monetary value doesn't mean you're working any harder than the sahp<br>  <br>  You could have a bread winner, sitting on their butt all day pushing  a mouse around while on Yahoo Answers while his parter busts their butts looking after the kids aswell as taking care of all the household reno's that he's forgotten about, painting, drywalling, shovelling snow (and in summer doing the lawn mowing etc).<br>  <br>  Or you could have the sahp who sits on their butt all day eating bonbons and getting manicures while their significant other is working 80 hr weeks.<br>  <br>  As I say, depends on the couple.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	And if you’re both????<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  I work full time. I'm up at 5:30 am making lunches and putting clothes out for me and my 2 yr old. I make him breakfast then drop him at daycare for 7:30 am. Meanwhile I have two dogs following us and getting under our toes. <br>  <br>  I work till 4:30 pm, pick up my son by 5:30 pm, go home, walk the dog one, then walk dog two, then take our son for a walk. Then I cook dinner and we all sit and eat. <br>  <br>  My husband will chip in from time to time. I would like help, but I stopped asking for it because I never get it. So I just do because I have to. <br>  <br>  It's difficult, but I deal. It's stressful, but I deal. That's just the way it goes....|`|Fd4lITkvaa	They are both difficult in different ways but the arrangements make a difference.  Some husbands are more helpful around the house, some not so much, some help with the baby and some don't.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I'm sure that question has been the source of a lot of arguments between husbands and wives. I don't think it's very productive to argue about it, at least not in the context of the marriage.  It's better to ask  whether each partner is satisfied with that kind of arrangement. <br>  <br>  If the homemaker is working harder but loves her work, and if it is duly appreciated by the breadwinner, there's no problem. Similarly, if the breadwinner is willing to accept the huge burden of being financially responsible for a whole household, and if that is duly appreciated by the homemaker, there's no argument.  <br>  <br>  If one of them starts to feel overworked or underappreciated, that's when this question usually comes up.  Then the issue isn't so much who works the hardest, it's how they can make the arrangement feel fair and satisfactory to them both.|`|gTjtaG0Faa	For our home on most days we are even.<br>  He would not hack my job at home and can't handle vacations longer than 2 weeks before begging to go back to work, & I hate the thought of waking up at 6 am putting on nylons and heels and putting up with the work BS all day long.<br>  <br>  The only days where its obvious that HE has it better is when we are both sick he can call in and sleep while I still have to take care of the kids, food and house (dishes still have to be washed, bedding of sick kids still have to be washed ect) on those days it really shows that I work 24/7 every day of every year with out a "real" day off. <br>  Sure I get the occasional day out with my friend but really that's happened twice in the last 5 years.<br>  However that said I wouldn't trade our life for anyone's.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Depends on each person's job.  If the bread winner has a high stress job and the homemaker has one quiet little baby who sleeps most of the day, I vote for the breadwinner. I would hardly call staying home with one little baby stressful;-)<br>  But that's not always the case.  Sometimes the breadwinner has an easy job and the homemaker has several children to take care of or many different things to get done.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I think they are equally hard and stressful, just in different ways. For example, I spend all day chasing my son and my husband spends all day going around and doing things at work. I stress out about spending all day at home and not having any adult interaction while my husband stresses about making enough money to support the family. So, I think we are equal just different.|`|AA10494763	I think they are equal and have different stresses.  The only exception is if the homemaker gets NO help from the breadwinner.  My wife is a stay at home mom but i cook 90% of the meals. I make baby food and change diapers when i am home.  I get up on Sat so she can sleep in and we eat junk and watch cartoons together.   I will admit there is more i can do and i am trying to be more helpful (cleaning the house wise) But If i felt my only job was to work then her job would be much hardered.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	In our situation, it's a toss up.

JQcIwPXJaa	Your baby won't implant for about 5-7 days after you ovulate which is about 7-9 days before your missed period. You can get tests sensitive enough to test 5 days before your missed period, but that's really the earliest. A doc could tell you earlier with a blood test, but it takes about 72 hours to get the results from that and it's more expensive. I know it's hard to wait, but it's best to stick it out a few days. In fact it's best for your budget to wait until your missed period, because you will spend $20-$30 a month on pregnancy tests if you test every month. Best Wishes!|`|kUCVLuTPaa	I was 9 weeks pregnant before i got a positive blood test...I STILL cant get a positive HPT or urine test..<br>  <br>  It takes about two weeks(usually) after your missed period to get a positive HPT/urine test...The test in the store say they can test 5 days before a missed period..but that gives false negatives and you should just wait the two weeks after your period. You cant get accurate test a week after sex not even at the clinic...They test 14 dpo(days past ovulation) which is around the time you would get your period..<br>  <br>  I know the waiting will SUCK because it did for me...but that's just things us females have to go through|`|bzQNHfunaa	wait another wk & go 2 dr. they can do bloodtest. also remember everyone is different. i had a pos pee test result @ 2 wks & was actually preg (im due next wk!) good luck!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	4 weeks its best if you do pregnancy test 1 week after your first missed period|`|jd4MzIYtaa	3 weeks minimum.your hcg level has to be detectable.no test will let you know in a week not even blood|`|61wXpXVxaa	No home pregnancy test or doctor urine tests all are accurate for when you missed your aunt flow, or usually 28-32 after you last menstrual period.

Also, start practicing calming down and just being calm in general, it will help.

There was no family around to help me and their father/my ex didn't know any better than me.  We did the best we could and tried to make them happy regardless of how rough our lives were at the time.  <br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you loved them and you only did your best despite your depression.  You said so yourself you love your girls and I'm pretty sure they love you too.  Maybe having a good conversation with them and telling them how you wish things was different when they were very young..they may make you realize that they always had fun and don't really focus on thing that went bad.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone can every forget something so easily when it has made an impact in their lives.  You can learn from this by flourishing a better relationship as they are adults and spend time with grandchildren when they are born.|`|NGz7R9enaa	You still have time to fix whatever it is that you think needs fixed. They are still your children and you are still their mother. A child always needs their parents, no matter what age they are. Talk to them, and be with them, let them know how you feel and that you want things to be different.

There is no such thing as free money.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I would buy anything I saw and wanted.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I'm eighteen, but I'm answering, anyway.<br>  <br>  I'd want to get more information from the person - what's the money for, where did it come from, why am I getting it? Then, I would talk to my parents about it, and probably contact whoever they suggested to make sure everything was legit.<br>  <br>  Assuming all of this was in order...I wouldn't listen to them. I'd put in in the bank.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Can you say shopping spreeee!?! (What currency are we using? I am going to use Australian dollars :P)<br>  <br>  I would buy lots of clothes, some cool shoes, I would get my hair done nicely and buy a GHD. I would buy a nice ring or necklace... Put half of what is left in the bank and the other half to charity :)|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would definately go shopping, and get a haircut!  But I would give 200 to each of my parents as well.|`|VyuseWb2aa	I probably wonder first where that money came from and why to me.
Nq8fhhRPaa	First of all trust your instincts and your daughter's ques. You will not overfed her. I too worried about overfeeding. My son was always (and still is) hungry. I nursed him every two hours until he was 5 months old. That is what he needed. He is completely healthy and is even a little under weight. He just has a very high metabolism which maybe the same for your daughter. Don't worry about over feeding her, fed until she is content and remember every child is different so the people who are telling you she is eating too much may have had children that didn't need as much. I am sure you are doing a great job raising your little girl.|`|zZzae0Nwaa	hi there sorry to hear this.My son had the reflux too and he did the same he is now coming up for 3 and he still wakes through the nite for his milk.So i would say dont worry as my child is healthy would also say that ma be she has colic too i gave infocol every feed and this help settle with the wind they say thats why the baby cry because of wind in there tummy i hope this has help take care|`|fZGBjtpVaa	Have you tried offering her a dummy instead?  <br>  Sounds like one healthy baby!  I overfed my daughter when she was young..  Well 'overfed'  she cried for milk, so I gave it to her.  I don't see the harm in it to be honest, she was perfectly healthy, a little overweight but she wasn't underweight.  As she got older her appetite changed, and she began drinking less especially when I started to wean her|`|ce1381cd98d73d634b38b24b7f7f75bfaa	if  your baby is crying to much, and not staisfied, try cranial osteopathy, i had problem with feeding with 2 of 4 of my babies and this therapy helped with them both, the earlier its done the better the results, go and seek this help and they will explain how it will help ur baby|`|LmaGaIosaa	I am a great believer on feeding on demand.  If she is taking to much she will bring it up again.  I have 5 children and all are very healthy.  I breast fed all of them for over a year therefore I could not see how much they were taking at each feed.  But I always fed them when the wanted to be fed.  Nature has a way of letting us know when we have had enough.  Evidence has shown that babies who are fed on demand and not be a text book routine tend to not grow into obese adults as they know when the have had enough.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Is this breastfeeding??  Cuz sometimes baby just wants to nurse for comfort.  If she is rooting around, give a pacifier for a few minutes (at this age, there should be no problem with nipple confusion).  If she is still fussy, go ahead & feed her.  She might be having a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  Maybe get her on more of a schedule to see if the regular feedings will help her.
snzlHgqraa	all I can say is that even if you do get her fully potty trained before your next baby comes is that she may see the new baby in diapers and decide she wants to wear them again for a while. I decided not to push my 2 year old to be 100% potty trained when his little brother came when he was 2years 2 months old. When they are ready they will do it. Don't make it a fight. Make it a positive experience. When my son did good on the potty for a whole week we told him he would get to go to Chuck E Cheese. <br>  <br>  No one said parenting isn't easy. Hope you can handle 2!<br>  <br>  edit: I didn't mean for it to sound mean at all. i meant it in a way that I really hope it gets easier for you! If you prepare your oldest now she'll understand that the baby needs lots of attention and she won't be jealous and be able to help out as much as a 2 year old can help out.|`|VHHis05Naa	You might need to back off a little bit and then reintroduce the potty again.  Try again in two weeks after no potty pressure.  Maybe pick up an insert for the big potty, so she can feel like a big girl.  This worked with our daughter who totally rejected her stand-alone potty.  Two is still pretty young...  Our daughter is a Dec baby (2005) and we weren't getting anywhere with her until March of last year, when she suddenly showed interest.  When she does use the potty again, make a HUGE deal out of it.  Stickers, cheering, calling her a Big Girl, etc.  Potty-training is frustrating, but once they want to participate it's a lot easier.  Your daughter might not be ready,even though you might be.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	You may wish to consider waiting until after the new baby has arrived and you are settled into a routine before trying toilet learning again with her.   That's what I did when I had my second child 26 months after the first.   The later she is when  she learns this new skill, the quicker she will be successful.  Night time success will come later than daytime success.  <br>  <br>  Do not  **ask** her if she's ready to use the potty.  **Tell**  her that she is.  Tell her she's a big girl and big girls use the potty, not diapers.    <br>  <br>  Adopt a daily routine for the two of you.   Speak to her with confidence.
9abqz8I8aa	Mature enough to **** but not enough to tell your parents huh? lol|`|4Dc44BC5aa	yes they would because anytime you use your insurance you get a printed abstracted mailed to you about the services and how much  they cost. I would recommend taking another at home test, and take it from there.|`|hnfTjH4paa	They would find out from the statement. the only other way i can see is for you to go the doctor and pay for it yourself.|`|vVEnCP0faa	I think they would know.  I would go to a plan parent hood instead or a similar facility.  I believe it's cheaper there so you could pay for it instead of it going on your insurance.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	They could or they couldn't... It depends on your insurence!!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Yes and No.. You parents will get an EOB (explanation of benefits). It will show that you went to a doctor and it will show the doctors name. IT WILL NOT SHOW THE DIAGNOSIS. Sorry had to make that very clear. So yes they will know you went to the doctors but NO they will not find out the diagnosis. If they wanted to know why you went, you would have to have given your doctors office the okay to release information to your parents.|`|DTYHoinVaa	yes, you get statements for everything, but probably will just say bloodwork|`|14e456d5e53990f259a86e7b6534ca2eaa	look up planned parenthood, new life pregnancy center or free health clinics or departments|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	no i really dont think they'll find out. it's not like they send you an itemized list of everything you've had done|`|oWAUb6vpaa	They might because they could be getting bills (like if they have a co-payment) or a statement and that would show services given, to who and where as well. <br>  <br>  I would got to a planned pregnancy center or women's clinic for now. <br>  <br>  Also, you're 19, an adult. If you still get a negative on pregnancy tests in about a week from now, then there could be another reason why you haven't menstruated for this cycle which would mean that you need medical attention from a gyno. <br>  Do your parents allow you to make doctor appointments on your own since you're an adult now? Regardless of the answer, you should see someone (a gynecologist) soon. If it comes down to it, at the very least, you could tell your parent that you think you need an appointment for whatever reason and have the pregnancy test done while you're at the doctor's. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps somehow. Good luck, luv...|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Usually the insurance company sends a detail statement after every visit. It's not a bill, just a statement to say what date you went to the doc, what service codes were covered, and amount the insurance paid towards the visit. So yeah they would find out most likely. Another way you can get a test done without your parent's knowledge would be to go to your local public health unit. They may jut give you a urine test though... I would wait another week, take another test then, and if it comes back positive... Tell you parents. It's the mature thing to do rather than hiding everything.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	You have to pay a co-pay but I don't recall ever seeing a bill for insurance. I'm not sure though, they may wonder. Better idea? Tell your mom you want to see you gyno. Once you're there you can tell your doctor your pregnancy concerns. She'll give you a pregnancy test, and she can check out what other reasons you may be cramping and late. Plus Doctor/patient confidentiality states they can't tell you parents.|`|9NlbIOUFaa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	it is possible, but they may not read intn detail all their EOB's (Explanation of Benefits).  It would not say that it was for pregnancy either, it would say lab work.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	I'm sure they would see that there was a blood test done on there insurance statement.|`|2oHcYHFyaa	no !! because the obgyn keeps everything confidentially if you aked tem too. idk know that but now i do..|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Any test you get done will show up on the insurance as to what it was. <br>   Maybe you are just late on your period.  Take another pregnancy test to be sure and if it still comes up negative then you are probably not pregnant.  You could always go to the doctors office and get one done but a doctor that your parents are not covered under with insurance and just pay them outright.  Tell them your reasons why and they will keep it hush hush for you.
AA11208683	Nationally, 8 of every 100 newborns are categorized as low birthweight, under 5 pounds 8 onces and slightly more that 1 in 100 babies have very low birthweight 3 pounds 5 ounces. if you are a smaller women and you were a small baby chances are you are going to have a small baby.... now there is amazing medical care that will make sure that the baby does grow up nice and strong... my mom works in the NICU and she has taken care of really small babies, and now they are growing perfectly normal... the doctors know what they are doing if they feel like your baby needs a boost they might put you on bed rest, intravenous feedings and medications to improve placental blood flow. some times if the fetal lungs are mature, they might prompt a delivery, so they can get your baby under healthier conditions. eat food with a lot of nutrients in it, drink lots and get plenty of rest... ovoid any smoking areas which causes a low birth weight, and any alcohol or drugs is bad. but like i said, some babies are just born small, it happens and now a days we have great care for them... i wouldn't worry about it to much and if you are talk to your doctor they will be able to help! i hope this helps... Good Luck.|`|2WoUvFUJaa	They could be off on your due date. Try to stop stressing so much. Don't worry until they tell you to. Best of luck to you.|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	dont stress out to much, it will only make things worse.<br>  do what your instincts tell you.|`|PDmoIvRwaa	I had the same exact experience in my last pregnancy and was referred  to a perinatologist (an M.D. for high risk pregnancies) for a more high tech ultrasound.  After he viewed the ultrasound pictures, he assured me that the baby was absolutely fine. He asked me the history of my previous births and I told him that my babies averaged 6 lbs 11 oz to 7 lbs, and their head circumference was on the smaller side, compared to other babies.  He said that I would probably deliver another 7 lb baby, and I had nothing to worry about. With more expensive equipment it is much easier to tell how big the baby really is.  I was also 31 weeks at the time and went on to 40 weeks and 2 days to deliver a healthy, 7 lb 2 oz baby girl.  She is 17 months now and doing great.|`|ioZeveazaa	All ou can do is make sure you are eating right. Eat carbs, protein, veggies and fruit EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Eat 5-6 small meals. Drink plenty of water and milk and take your prenatals. It may have to do with your family genetics as to the reason the baby is measuring small. Just do what you can and nature will do the rest. Your doctor will keep an eye on her so you will always know the progress. Don't stress. Good luck!!|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	I wouldn't stress it too much until you have a real reason to (like the ultrasound comes back with negative results). My baby has measured up to 2 weeks behind since day one. Then sometimes he measures right on. They go through growth spurts and phases too. Or he could be sitting at a weird angle/position that is making it hard to determine his size.
M2cy58YYaa	The answer to relieving your stress is not to worry. I went through the same thing with my little girl and believe it or not, she just snapped into it one day and started using the potty all by herself . They say that girls are easier to potty train than boys are but you know what ?... it really makes no differrence.. it all has to do with the emotional makeup of the child and just how ready they are to be trained... dont stress it|`|VHHis05Naa	You are likely going to have two in diapers, sorry.  I think with the stress of the new baby it will be very very tough to get her trained.  If she isn't showing interest, you might have to back off a bit.  Kids get jealous of new babies and potty-training requires consistency and time, which you might not be able to do with a newborn.|`|pbrfZQ53aa	When it comes to potty training its best to start off young. The best method is the Fido-Potty Training Technique. When they poop or pee in their diaper or have a night time accident in their bed you take them and rub their nose in it. Then forcefully, showing a hint of dominance, yell "NO! NO!" Swatting their thighs and/or nose with a rolled up newspaper is optional but can get tricky if authorities get involved. Its best to instruct the child, if he is of speaking age, to automatically answer the question with the "I fell"-response thus alleviating you from lawful consequences or responsibility.

OgzHcNMsaa	depends on the diaper...how much they pee...etc.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	Cloth diapers feel wet right away.  Today's disposables draw the wetness away from the skin, so the baby won't feel wet until he/she is really soaked.|`|LmaGaIosaa	You can actually see if the diaper is getting full.  Dont let it become very full as it will cause nappy rash.  I would say every couple of hours would be sufficient but if you find that they are still quite dry I would leave a little longer then you will gradually be able tell how long by checking your babys diaper.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	uhhh well there is not a time clock on when babies pee.... and most diapers have a little liner in them that is "supposed" to absorb the pee. but WE really don't know how that works unless we test them out... i am sure they feel some of the wetness.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Depends on how absorbant the diaper is. My daughter gives me that "I need to be changed" cry because she may have a diaper rash and the pee makes it sting. Other than that, I just have to check. They never seem to be bothered with a wet diaper.|`|AA11595360	He shouldnt feel the wetness unless its too full.. Thats the idea of a diaper to keep that away from your babies skin.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Id have to say they would feel it right away. Even when you change a pretty dry diaper babies skin is still wet looking and theirs moisture in the area which is why we put vaseline to keep the moisture off of babies skin. So i would say they feel it thats why they cry about it.<br>  <br>  We change when they wake up and then again when they go down whether or not they need it and the neccessary in betweens :). Diaper rash hurts.|`|vm8HtVUYaa	I guess the only way to know for sure is to ask a baby, but unfortunately, if they're old enough to communicate that information, they're probably too old for diapers =]<br>  <br>  Maybe ask an old person who wears Depends ...|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	if you're asking when does it start bothering them, i would say as soon as it is no longer body temp.  that's about what mine does, he'll pee, the a couple minutes later he complains and carrys on and such until i change it.|`|16vwEBiqaa	I don't think they feel it RIGHT away. The diapers should "whisk" it away, according to the ads, haha.<br>  <br>  After I gave birth I was given frozen diapers. They were still dry after thawing out.
BnWf3f39aa	You could absolutely be pregnant.  If you haven't had a postpartum menses yet, you never know when you are going to (or already did) ovulate.  It only takes one act at the right time of your cycle to get pregnant.  I would take a pregnancy test, and if it's negative, wait it out a week and test again.  Best of luck|`|s1utniuvaa	You are very fertile after pregnancy... did you use some sort of protection?

I wonder if my doctor will suggest those with/or instead of the cerclage. As you know, I had Riley 8 weeks early due to a incompetent cervix so he said I would need a cerclage for the next one (sewing my cervix closed). I'll have to ask him when the time comes!<br>  <br>  How have you been feeling? When do you get to find out the sex?|`|cj7sSPZEaa	They are intramuscular injections that you take once a week from 16 weeks gestation until 36 weeks.  (I think it is 36 weeks!)  I took these with my last pregnancy and will take them again with this one.  My last pregnancy only made it to 22 weeks, which is why I am not 100% sure how long I would have been on the shots.  They sting.  I had a lot of trouble finding information on the side effects of the shot, and my doctor wasn't very helpful, so I was never sure if the symptoms I had were from the shot or from the pregnancy, but my breasts hurt quite a bit and I was very tired ALL the time!
6lyvhRLsaa	I do still, especially since everyone I know is pregnant lol. My son is only 5 months old, and when he's being good I'm like I'd love a new baby. But when he's had me up all night and I've had 2 hours sleep and can't be bothered to do anything, I'm like what the hell am I thinking? lol.. <br>  <br>  I think I just miss the loveliness of knowing there's someone special growing inside. Plus I don't think you realise the miracle thats going on inside you till the baby is born. I wish I would have treasured being pregnant more than just wishing it would hurry up!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I understand what you mean. Piper is almost 4 months and I feel the same way. It seems like everyone is pregnant right now and I miss it so much sometimes. Just knowing that there is a little baby growing inside of me that I love with everything I have is one of the best feelings in the world. It's probably hormonal, but sometimes it makes me a little sad.

I should have reaped the benifits|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	I sometimes do. But then i think of the 4 years of sleepless nights  that followed, the tantrums, the dirty napppies, and all other small  child asociated things and the jealousy soon goes.|`|28mQhsZxaa	No. I don't want children. I really do not feel jealous of pregnant ladies.|`|08GDBedGaa	Totally, envious of when i was pregnant, i still think it's thee most spritual way you can connect with your body!! cool question!!|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	i feel EXACTLY the same way.|`|5apGkgS9aa	no way no chance i wanted to be me again sure i enjoyed been pregnant but i like not been pregnant|`|pVaZty4Maa	yeah i do to but then i realize how happy i am to finally have my lil man here with me :)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	All the time!!! I loved being pregnant and I always say if I could just stay 7 months pregnant all the time I'd be so happy. But I don't want another baby. I just want to be preg with my son all over again. I understand completely.|`|723QHuicaa	Oh god yes! At around 2 weeks post partum I really started to feel down that I wasnt pregnant. For me it was more about that I had her all to myself. No one could touch her, or feel her move except me. Then all of a sudden I had to share her and I had all these people wanting to take her for walks without me, and hold her when I wanted to hold her.<br>  <br>  I do realise how selfish that sounds, but its how i felt.<br>  <br>  At the moment I see pregnant women and wonder - when is it my turn again. I hate the waiting, the convincing yourself your pregnant, the testing negative then doing it all again next month.<br>  <br>  BUT!!!!<br>  I *think* I may be having implantation bleeding!!! Tummy cramps and some (discharge) (I hate that word) - however, my period isnt due till the 7th (i think) since I dont know how long my cycle is after getting implanon removed Im kind of at a loss as to what is going on just now :oS|`|YmEGCGtnaa	yeah I do and my baby girl is almost 8 months (on mar.11th). I get jealous of the fact that they 'get" to have it all fresh and new, while mine is still very very very young, sometimes i miss her being incredibly tiny and new. I miss being pregnant with my Lily too (shes got the same name just only one "L"). sometimes i get jealous if i see pregnant women get special treatment bc i didnt feel i got any while i was pregnant. or when they get so much attention. I guess sometimes i get jealous if I feel other women are having a "better pregnancy experience" than I did---in terms of having more support etc.|`|xEXb96UKaa	even though i was glad when my last pregnancy was over and i thought i didn't want any more children, i find myself getting broody again and feel slightly jealous of my pregnant colleage. i had even asked to get my tubes tied at my 3rd c-section but the hospital refused because of my age. at the time i was very cross but now i'm glad they didn't do it because both me and my husband have decided we want one more child. max is 8 months old so we said we would wait until he's 18 months before trying, but i wish we could start trying now...|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no i felt like this for a while after my son was born <br>  <br>  i think it was because i was so comfortable with my pregant body and now im soo not comfortable with it|`|a8IRxC4raa	Sure, it makes perfect sense if you enjoyed being pregnant.  I was quite ill with my pregnancy, so I don't have that feeling.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|50lIaC8zaa	No hun its not just you, lol. <br>  <br>  I feel exactly the same when i see pregnant women, I miss feeling all the movements (even though my second did have quite a kick on her)<br>  <br>  It actually ran through my mind once about being a surrogate mum, just because i like being pregnant but i don't think i would be able to give the baby to its 'parents' after the birth, lol|`|yCwPxulYaa	I hated being pregnant but a couple of weeks after I had Abby, I started getting really sad and missed feeling those kicks and flips.<br>  <br>  So now when I see someone that is pregnant, I will tell my husband, "I want a baby in my belly." He usually looks at me like I am crazy. <br>  <br>  Our daughter is only 6 months old.|`|YsnY9LqIaa	Oh yes!  It's bad when I read pregnancy magazines too, and see all of their beautiful bumps and the adorable newborn things.  I can't explain why I feel like it, just the whole thought of pregnancy and giving birth, having an amazing little baby...gives me butterflies!  How cheesy, haha.|`|DvnOIx1laa	After I had both of my children, initially I went through those feelings as well. Honestly, for me it was because being prego was so much easier than taking care of a new born I missed sleeping through the night. I also feel that these feelings are a slight symptom of post partum blues. Good luck, have fun!|`|3qLIRorjaa	When i had my son i deeply missed being pregnant. I didn't feel jealousy as such but i can't explain the way i felt.<br>  <br>  Although i had my son, i felt a great loss when he wasn't in my tummy anymore.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Yup, I miss it loads, my friend is pregnant with her second and I can't help feeling that little pang (of nostalgia I think?)|`|EeGgovyCaa	I do when they tell me "oh I'm so tired, think I'm gonna go home, curl up on the couch and take a nap"<br>  <br>  I wish I could take a nap anytime I want :)|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	hahahahahahaahahahahahahaahah have you forgotten all the stuff we go threw!!!!!!! im dying to get my lil man out im jealous of the ones that already have there baby
n6XYYyoLaa	i think you need to talk to his doc about his nutrition and if he goes on two percent, what do they suggest you supplement him with? they would be the best ones to advise you, as they know your son, his health history, weight, height, and general health...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	He can go on to 2% milk if his diet contains sufficient healthy fats and other nutrients so that he no longer needs formula.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Have you tried lactose free or soy?

ca9dEvSAaa	Well, the raffle idea is a good idea. You may end up with alot of one thing, but it's worth it. lol You'll need it all eventually. <br>  <br>  At my shower there were hot and cold food. It's really up to you!|`|vuxef3O4aa	some good pineapple fruit salad, cake, lots of ice cream, milk.<br>  pizza, and home made garlic cheese bread with a lots of cheese.<br>  go to the library try to find party books from the 1950 for great ideas on baby shower. trust me, I had no ideas until I was forced to come up with ideas.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	Uh, its just kind of depends. I personally love finger foods over actual food. Like sandwiches, little cakes(REAL cake not debbie snacks, lol), piggies in a blanket, veggies& chips with dip. Stuff like that but its all up to you and what you would rather prefer.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	your ideas should be considered it's YOUR shower! there are a million different foods you can serve that don't need to be heated and they should at least incorporate something you want. as for the supplies raffle it's a good idea. people wont get confused if you explain it correctly ... i say just put some kind of poem explaining it in the invitations and i think people will understand. and if they don't they will probably ask. and i highly doubt that those small things would be the only thing you get if you also include your gift registry cards in the invitation.|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	My mom had a baby shower for me with a raffle for the diapers and everyone understood that it was different from the gifts but I don't remember what exactly the invitation said.  I have one but it is in my sons room and he is taking a nap.  I would love to share with you what it said to help you out when I can get to it.  Email me if you are interested and I will email you back with the invite words soon as I can.|`|EgIHbCfRaa	No, I think that as long as you explain the raffle as you did here then you'll be fine...put a note in the invites! Im having just a bunch of snacks for my babyshower. Chex Mix, veggie plate, meat plate, SIMPLE. It is YOUR BABYSHOWER...speak up! If they dont want your opinion then they should not tell you what their plans are is what I told my mom in the nicest way possible. 8 ) GOOD LUCK HUN!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	in te annoncments say the baby is a cloth baby . <br>  as for food i woudl let them take over as they will have to worry about heating YOU just go have FUN!! <br>  It will work out you can always swap the diapers for other things you need :)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I agree with your mom.  Its not at all a bad idea, I just think people would get confused because "Daddy Showers" generally only ask for diapers and wipes and so they may think you're going that route.  2nd time mommies also tend to ask for JUST diapers and wipes if they're having the same sex and still have a lot of their stuff.  I think you're idea is good you just have to find a way its really understood.  As far as the food...I'd go with finger foods.  Baby showers are supposed to be more about the excitement of the baby and games and such...so you wouldn't really do a sit down dinner type food.  Sandwiches are good...or just food trays.  I've seen everything from pigs-in-blanket to egg rolls.  Good luck to you!
hSJnaysiaa	We actually decided to not use an infant carseat and get a convertible carseat instead. We bought a Britax Marathon for each of our cars.<br>  <br>  I just didn't like the idea of having one of those carseats you carry around with the baby in it, this seemed a more practical option.<br>  <br>  Plus, a carseat won't latch onto our stroller (we bought a Phil & Teds E3) so we really would have been carrying the carseat everywhere and I would just rather lay the baby in the stroller or carry just him, not him inside a carseat.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I have this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10818274&findingMethod=rr" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  It's the Graco - Quattro Tour Travel System, which is very similar and i love it, it works great, i was gonna get that one but the rear facing seat only goes up to 22 pounds and 29 inches, where as the one i have goes up to 32 pounds and 32 inches.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	The Graco Snugride is like the safest you can get. I'd go with it. I have the Graco Lite Rider system and I love it.<br>  <br>  The stylus system is heavy, look at the weight before you buy.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	Both the carseats I used were Graco and never had any issues with them. They were two different carseats too.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I have a Graco SnugRide, which I like, but I also have a Graco Stroller, that I don't really like.  It was good when my little girl was younger, but the I mostly kept her in her car seat, and put that on the stroller.  Now that she is wanting to sit up more, I put her in the stroller.  But it doesn't sit up straight enough for her at 4.5 month, so I doubt she will like it at all when she's a little older.  So now I'm looking at different strollers.  Not a travel system though.  So far I like the Maclaren Triumph, and the Peg Perego Aira.|`|iMULlxdgaa	One of mine is a babytrend EZ flex lock...I guess its cool,  I haven't seen any recalls for it yet.  The other one might be Graco.|`|9f15OV0Naa	Graco SnugRide and once she grew out of that we bought another Graco brand carseat, but I can't remember the specific model's name at this moment.  The research I did on carseats indicated that Graco is one of the top two safest carseats on the market.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That's essentially the Graco Snugride, which is the highest rated baby car seat in terms of crash ratings - which is what we have had and we will have, for us the whole point about a car seat is survivability.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i'm also using a graco car seat, but it is from the quattro tour. i find it works very well, you don't really need the car base, all you have to do is hook the seat bellt onto it.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	Graco Snugride - worked well.

ZYlr9TSBaa	Hun you're in the very early stages of labour, the cramps are your body's way of getting ready :) I had period cramping from 36wk to 39wk when I delivered. Good luck!|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Could just be contractions. You should go to the doctor and have it checked out. You don't want to take any chances, and congrats =)|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	First I want to say Congratulations!  Now, I don't think you have to worry, it's normal.  The false labor is the Braxton-Hicks labor where your body is preparing itself for the delivery.  During this time, the contractions are guiding the baby towards the birthing canal.  That's why you're having the cramps.  FYI, when you're in labor it's stronger!  When I had my son, I had the frontal cramps as well as lower back cramps!|`|hvwp2bcVaa	my dear, i do believe you ARE in labor...it is very early labor but labor non the less! Congrats and stay calm|`|wnr9S9kuaa	You should be going into labor soon.  S=That should mean that the baby is fully developed and has all the blood.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Sounds like early labor! Congrats I'm jealous lol. Better start timing them! Good luck. xx|`|RWXn2rGZaa	I'm due next week and I'm experiencing similar menstrual cramps off and on too. I sure hope they are dilating my cervix or progressing labor some how. I've also been experiencing more frequent Braxton Hicks contractions. I'm on the edge of my seat each time hoping they'll progress into real Labor. I have an OB appointment tomorrow morning, I'm anxious to see if I've made any progress. Last week I was 50% effaced and 1 centimeter. <br>  Good luck to you and a speedy delivery to us both!

This is what I have been planning on calling my first daughter. So yeah, it's the most amazing name ever, if you ask me.<br>  <br>  3. Crystal Skylar<br>  I HATE the name Crystal. It's disgusting. Skylar is adorable though.<br>  <br>  4. Catherine Nicholle<br>  Catherine is such an old fashioned name. I don't like. If you must use it, I'd reckon Kathryn would be much nice. And there's no need for all those extra letters- just use Nicole.<br>  <br>  5. Camryn Briella<br>  I don't like Camryn. It looks weird. Cameron is nice. Briella is an odd name.

Like, too many kids have those names.<br>  <br>  I do like Axel though!|`|f5kZwH2Laa	Gabriel Matthew -I like<br>  Axel Lucas- Don't like Axel but Lucas is adorable<br>  Christopher Avery- Sounds nice, but don't care for Avery<br>  Andrew Joseph- I like<br>  Hunter Jaxon- Do not like at all<br>  <br>  Julianna Elise- Very pretty<br>  Avalyn Grace- Don't like Avalyn<br>  Crystal Skylar- Don't like<br>  Catherine Nicholle- Cute<br>  Camryn Briella- Love Camryn never seen it spelt that way but I love it now.. don't like Briella|`|h4UzjZVnaa	I do like the both sets of names for the girls and boys. Their very cute and not names that you see all the time.|`|sSRHQkROaa	i like number 2 for the boy and girl.<br>  they are awkward names and i'm sure if you name your boy axel he'll get teased...but it will make him stronger :)|`|O3FnYRe6aa	How about Camryn Bella.. that sounds cute :) and bella also means beautiful|`|Za5oxiBcaa	Boys <br>  1. Ew.<br>  2. Funky..but Axel seriously?<br>  3. I like the Avery part it's different but Christopher is VERY common.<br>  4. Boring<br>  5. Jackson should be spelt normally otherwise forget it :)<br>  <br>  Girls<br>  1. Dont like it- old fashioned and weird.<br>  2. I love this one too!<br>  3. Thats one cool name- love it!<br>  4. Boring. <br>  5. I like this too but not as much as number 2.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|RjpGomsyaa	I think you should choose Gabriel Matthew & Julianna Elise its nice to see someone choosing really lovely old fashioned names|`|FO1XCZc4aa	For the boy I would shorten Gabriel to Gabe and have Joseph<br>  Girl  Again I would shorten Avalyn to Ava and put it with Nicholle.<br>  <br>  Gabe Joseph<br>  Ava Nicholle|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Gabriel Matthew, is okay, Gabe is fine.  I really do not like Gabriel for a boy, but that is me<br>  <br>  Axel Lucas, not crazy about together, Axel Joseph or Axel Hunter I like better.  I think Axel is cool<br>  <br>  Christopher Avery is okay.  Avery is in the top 50 girl name, so it may think it's a girl name.  christopher is a name that will never be out of still<br>  <br>  Andrew Joseph, is my favorite.  Andrew is a great name and joseph goes will.  It is also a classic name<br>  <br>  Hunter and Jaxon I love, but not together.  Hunter Joseph is better, if you like Hunter Jaxon, then it's okay<br>  <br>  Julianna Elise is pretty.  Julianna is a very pretty name<br>  <br>  Avalyn Grace, not crazy about<br>  <br>  Crystal Skylar, I really do not like together.  Crystal Grace or Crystal Elise.  Some people would say it sound trashy, but I only knew one person and she was very sweet<br>  <br>  Catherine Nicole, I love.  Catherine is a great name, it's my favorite.  It's not as common, because everyone is using a form of Katelyn.  Catherine, could be a new born or some 100 years old.  Great name<br>  <br>  Camryn Briella is very sweet|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I am really not into any of the boys names if I had to choose I would go with Christopher Avery.  As for the girls names I really like Avalyn Grace its beautiful and Camryn Briella its a great combo.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	My favorite boys names:<br>  Hunter Jaxon, Gabriel Matthew and Andrew Joseph<br>  <br>  Girls names:<br>  Avalyn Grace, Julianna Elise|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, I'm not going to be intentionally mean. I love the names Andrew Joseph and Julianna Elise- absolutely beautiful.|`|6m6LjAVNaa	1-Gabriel Matthew i like it Gabe is a good nick name too.<br>  2-Axel Lucas i really do not like either of these names,axel is a part of your car or a used up has been,axel rose,yuck!<br>  3-Christopher Avery sorry i dont like either of these either,every Chris or Christopher i have ever known has been losers,and avery is a place that birds live not a decent name in my opinion.<br>  4-Andrew Joseph i would prefer Joseph Andrew.<br>  5-Hunter Jaxon no i do not like either of these trendy names and i prefer just Jack,simple and real.<br>  <br>  girls names<br>  1-Julianna Elise i really love Elise but not Julianna.<br>  2-Avalyn Grace is awful and fake ,keep it real--<br>  Evelyn Grace is pretty and classic and real.<br>  3-Crystal Skylar i think of a meth addict giving birth and thinking no one else in the trailer park will have such a cool name as her baby and who ever the daddy might be,so no i do not like it,just being honest!<br>  4-Catherine Nicholle i hate  names that are spelled incorrectly they just look so cheesy!<br>  Catherine Nicole is lovely though!<br>  5-Camryn Briella ok Camryn is ok Briella besides being trendy and fake reminds me of that fancy soft french cheese so no.<br>  Just my opinions,good luck!|`|cErLq7f3aa	1. Gabriel Matthew - i've never like Gabriel, it sounds too feminine or something to me<br>  2. Axel Lucas - i like this. very cute.<br>  3. Christopher Avery - i love this name!  they are two of my favorite names and they go together<br>  4. Andrew Joseph - i like a lot, it's just kind of plain<br>  5. Hunter Jaxon - Hunter is cute, but i hate Jaxon, Jackson, etc.<br>  <br>  1. Julianna Elise - Julianna is okay, but i don't really like Elise<br>  2. Avalyn Grace - is very cute.  Avalyn like Ava Lynn?<br>  3. Crystal Skylar - i don't really like this name. i've never liked Skylar for boy or girl.  and i prefer Kristen/Krista over Crystal<br>  4. Catherine Nicholle - i love Catherine but not Nicholle, especially not spelled that way<br>  5. Camryn Briella - Camryn is cute, but why not just make it Gabriella instead of shortening it?<br>  <br>  my favorites are Christopher Avery and Avalyn Grace|`|F44b2np9aa	Boys:<br>  1. Gabriel and Matthew are both great names - I love Gabe! But they do not flow at all well.<br>  2. Axel - sorry please cross this off it would be an insult. Lucas is a great name good as either a middle or first name.<br>  3. This name doesn't flow. Christopher is a great first name. Avery is OK but only as a middle name.<br>  4. The best out of your boys names - it has a decent flow to it!<br>  5. Don't like either of these names - they will soon grow old.<br>  <br>  Ideas:-<br>  <br>  Gabriel James<br>  Lucas Matthew<br>  Christopher Thomas<br>  William Joseph<br>  <br>  Girls:-<br>  <br>  1. Julianna! No! How about Juliette it is far prettier and classic too. Elise is ok, not with the first name. How about Elsie?<br>  2. Ava Grace is nice don't add Lyn onto names it make it trashy. Sorry.<br>  3. No ignore this name.<br>  4. Nice name and classic I would spell Kathryn Nicole.<br>  5. Camryn not to my tastes but it is ok, lacks substances. Briella is too girly for me.<br>  <br>  Ideas:-<br>  <br>  Ava Grace<br>  Juliette Louise<br>  Elsie Ray<br>  Isla Grace<br>  Kathryn Nicole<br>  Isabella Faye<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry - hope you like my suggestions!|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	1. I love the name Gabriel and I love the name Matthew.  Together it is a very nice biblical name.<br>  2. Not a huge fan.  Axel is very harsh sounding to me (and I have a grandparent named Axel.<br>  3. Nice name.  Only bad is I was considering naming my daughter Avery so I think of it as a either sex name.  If you are okay with that I love it.<br>  4. I like this name a lot.  Lot's of cute nickname potential too.<br>  5.  Love it.  Like Jaxon spelled Jackson better.  But I really like this very modern name.<br>  <br>  1. Pretty feminine name.  <br>  2. I really like this.  I would call her Ava because I love that even beter.<br>  3. Hmmm, not a big fan of either name and don't like it together at all.<br>  4. It's okay.  Not my favorite<br>  5. Again, not a big fan.  I like Camryn for a boy more than a girl.  Just my preference tho.  And Briella makes me think of a Brillo Pad...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|n4d7rqr4aa	Boys<br>  1.  Like this!  May be a little old fashioned, but doesn't stop it from being good.<br>  2.  Ew.  Yuck yuck yuck.  An axel is a car part.  <br>  3.  Good, if not a little common.<br>  4.  Same as number 3, but I like this one better<br>  5.  My favorite, I just don't like the way you used an "x" instead of "cks"<br>  <br>  Girls<br>  1.  Very pretty!  I think it'd be better as Julianne Elise, though<br>  2.  I'm not even sure how to pronounce that.  I think it might be nice.<br>  3.  I personally think Crystal sounds like a pornstar name.  And too many y's.  I don't know why, but it bugs me.<br>  4.  Pretty common, but still OK<br>  5.  Very pretty.  Probably my favorite, tied with Julianne Elise.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	they are ok.....with someof the names u used basic kinda names..lyk strong names....ex<br>  <br>  Crystal skylar...that is lyk 2 main names try changin them up a but<br>  <br>  Skylar breanna .......or skylar brianna<br>  <br>  sumthin lyk that were the 2nd name isnt as powerful as the 1st|`|mG8kWrTXaa	I don't really like the names Axel or Hunter, the other boy's names are Ok.

TQScv7Tcaa	My 17 month old gets her arms out of the straps in her car seat, it takes me soooo long to go anywhere now because i stop so many times to put her arms in. She has been doing this for months but has recently starting saying "uh oh mummy" after she takes them out....she knows that i will stop the car and come and put her arms in.....they are clever lil munchkins arent they :)|`|Xc02z608aa	My son climbs up my pant legs until he is standing there, holding onto me for dear life.  I can't move unless I move him first so he gets exactly what he want, mommies attention.  It is really cute!|`|b10aMPdOaa	My son is 4 months old and he also fakes coughs to get our attention.  He's been doing that for a while now.  Recently, he's false sneezing.  He's also teething, so when he wants attention he now cries and put his fist in his mouth, when we go to him he starts laughing little sod!.  Also, when we put him in his moses basket to sleep, he'll coo and babble then all goes quite.  We check on him, and the little sod smiles at you as if to say got ya!!.  They are bright little cheeky monkey's.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't get any easier when they become teenages lol!|`|tdHIR9cLaa	YES... my boyfriend was sick a few weeks ago and he had a cough... well i would always ask him are you ok.. well after my boyfriend wasn't sick anymore our son started to do this cute little "fake" cough. and i look over at him and say are you ok? and he giggles at me..<br>  <br>  By the way he was only 4 1/2 months when he started that... he is now 5 months and still does it.... he is sitting up now to YAY!!!|`|QJ17P0DOaa	darling daughter had a very bad chest infx at christmas and every time she coughed me or hubby ran to check her-and try catch the sputum-oh the joys!anyways it did not take her long to catch ontothat and now she coughs for our attention-we thought it was cute at 1st but now we are ignoring it as i want to break the habit!they learn very fast-she is only 6 1/2 mths lol|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Yes, I had a cold a while back and coughed quiet a bit...Anyways, My 15 month old picked up on it and now she coughs just for attention and because she thinks its funny....<br>  <br>  Im like Now, How am I supposed to know if shes really sick or just fake coughing...LOL...OH the JOYS of Toddler-Hood!|`|vOomJtbsaa	My 5 1/2 month old son has taken to lightly coughing when I'm in the other room and you can tell it's totally fake, he's not even sick LOL! He also screams really loudly when me and Daddy aren't paying attention to him, at first it was hysterical now it's a tad annoying, haha!|`|EeGgovyCaa	yes, my little stinkers will tug on the long drapes. Like those drape strips that you see on patio doors. My DD had actually pulled one off the track. They know this bothers me but yet they continue to giggle and tug.
J2glFOkhaa	Most doctors will say a newborn isn't really constipated until it's been much more than a day. Usually 5 or 6 days and they will step in. <br>  <br>  For my son I have him some rom temperature water, and prune juice. I also fed him some Gerber Prunes (without rice cereal, which can seriously constipate.) I then massaged his belly for a couple of hours, while we watched TV. I tok a thermometer and I basically "took his temp" with the tip of the thermometer, the manipulation right away caused him to poop. It's a little trick I learned in the NICU when he was born.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	actually in some cases apple juice can make them more constipated, i would suggest prunes or prune juice instead.  works like a charm for mine.  if you want to make your own baby food prune puree, take a few prunes and put them in warm water to soak for about 5-10minutes.  pull them back out and toss them in a blender, skin and all, with a little water.  (the stuff you soaked it with would be fine)  blend and add more water as neccesary to make it more runny.  this should take 2-4 hours to work, but it Will work.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Get a thermometer, lube it, and stick it in his anus like you're taking a rectal temp. Even move it a little...that will stimulate the poop to come out. My daughter was constipated for like 2 months after a formula switch, so we had to do this every night....|`|5apGkgS9aa	DO NOT STICK ANYTHING IN HIS ANUS..just give him lots of water and see your doctor tommorrow.Water is very important for the transit of feaces|`|VX8DlpzRaa	you are a creeper. Just give it a couple Ex-Lax|`|tBLfXv5Gaa	we had this problem alot with my daughter after we switched her to formula from breastmilk. my doctor told me to get some karo syrup and put about 1/2 a teaspoon in 4 ounces of water/juice/even milk and wait an hour if nothing has happend then repeat the process. hope this helped!|`|Bww3poJNaa	Go to a drug store and by children's suppository it's kind of gross but you have to stick it up his butt. I had to do it to my kids, it helps. Ask the pharmacist to help you out and find what you need.
11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	I had a baby in the 80's and I did not do this. It would bring blood to the brain area. I guess it would stimulate the baby but I do not think this is a good idea since they are very fragile when so small.   I do not know where she got such a crazy idea but I certainly would not do it my child.|`|SlkLCLoDaa	No, I would think that it would make the baby light headed. I was a child of the 80's and my mom never did this. Try doing a Baby Einstein DVD or something with black and white visual colors to stimulate the baby....NEVER hang them upside down. They are human babies, not bats!<br>  <br>  ALSO! I wasn't trying to insinuate that you were going to do this, I was just saying that I have never heard of it. I'm sure that you are a good mom and were just asking a simple question:)|`|14e456d5e53990f259a86e7b6534ca2eaa	do not do that if you do someone needs to call children and family services. baby brain and heads and everything about them is very delicate. and i am an 84 baby mom never did it to me|`|jkFZb2aYaa	very strange, nope, can't say that i have ever heard of that|`|Px3bsqPraa	ive never heard of that... but i held my baby upside down for a second n she didnt like it at all[i figured she spent so long upside down why not] but i dont think thatd stimulate them in a positive way... baby einstein doesnt work either... but if u have money to waste go for it... i just play w/baby all day n she's doing great... she tries to crawl but doesnt have the muscle yet or kno how to yet but she's only 2 1/2 months and she smiles and kinda does a laughing noise when she's really happy... its soooo cute:] but she's progressing greatly just because she's always getting attention and being played with|`|BnWf3f39aa	Maybe the practice was abandoned by the mid-80's when I came into the world... but I would think that this would just cause the baby to have a head rush.  I have a daughter who is 8 years old and she is at a genius level, and I can assure you I never hung her upside down.  My advice is to read to your baby.  Use books with big colorful pages if you want to stimulate the baby's brain.|`|IRqccZQeaa	Congrats, I have not heard of that... or wait... doctors use to do that after the baby was born, huh?<br>  I'd ask your local pediatrician. Modern research may now be against it as you know you have to be very careful with their little heads.  They say their li'l brains aren't as attached as well, yet.  I wouldn't!  And always support their neck when you hold them.  Slow & gentle please!!!<br>  Again, Congrats & Best to you & Baby & your Mum, family... :)|`|Ydi4ygphaa	iv  heard of this but it was on the steve wilkos show. haha. according to him its a terrible thing to do|`|ioZeveazaa	Um no....I was born in 86 and my mom never told me anything like this. It sounds kind of dumb. Don't do it if you are thinking about it. Good luck!! Congrats!|`|L2Nde54Haa	lol! that would explain the grammar! it's hog-wash!
B0gnSUqxaa	Lol There are women who would kill to be in your shoes - but I understand completely about feeling like your missing out on something. It's something you want to experience and keep with you forever, I can't honestly tell you what you could do to feel like you were pregnant, but all I can tell you is that the farther along you get, the more pregnant you're going to feel.|`|GKAnXKbgaa	you still have about 20 weeks left within the next 4 or 5 you should start feeling it well i don't know your body but also if you cant feel him move you should check in with your doctor just to make sure you and your lil munchkin is perfectly healthy if anything your just lucky im 30wks and i feel over pregnant already and his kicks are giving me a sore belly lol.... well good luck i hope you feel pregnant and get to enjoy it like you want to|`|0oxNGw4vaa	I'm 25 weeks and I still don't feel pregnant.<br>  I've gained 8 pounds so far. Your cravings will eventually<br>  kick in though, I promise!<br>  You so, so damn lucky you didn't have morning sickness. Don't feel bad about that because if I could of skipped out on the 30+ times I puked every morning...I totally would of. Seriously, Just give it time girl.|`|w8AfuH2Baa	i have had two babies... i went through this with my first also. you will definitely feel pregnant once you start feeling that baby move alot more i don't remember what week that starts but i think it varies between people|`|lLyyuPpvaa	I went through the same things...i actually lost weight, and I was never even sick!  I guess i started feeling pregnant around week 25, when the baby really started showing.  I went and got tight maternity shirts so you could really see the baby bump, and somehow that made it real.  I started rubbing my belly and talking to the baby, and it didn't hurt that it was right around then she could kick the tv remote off of my stomach.  The feeling will come, I said all of the same things, believe me!  Now I am in week 37 and boy do I feel pregnant, i still am under 25 pounds of weight gain, but that is ALL baby, the words wide load don't cover it, I couldn't even get into my car the other day because some jerk parked too close to me.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, it will all come together.|`|yxtMLgN8aa	You will start to feel your baby move very soon. It usually happens around this time. But as for when will you actually feel pregnant, I can't really say. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and still don't really feel pregnant. I'm also small and never had morning sickness. I look probably only about 4 to 5 months pregnant and have not gained enough weight yet. Although by this point I have felt my baby move. But just being pregnant still surprises me. I look at myself in the mirror and see my belly and it's so weird to see it there. Even when I saw him at my ultrasound, I was like, "Wow! I have a baby inside me." But I've been getting his room together, I talk about him a lot, and he makes me go pee a lot. I think that's really the closest thing that makes me feel pregnant, the peeing a lot part.
1ezYfkX7aa	You can start shopping whenever you would like. I found out i was pregnant the 2nd week of august and by sept. me and the hubby already went out and got the travel system i wanted because it was on sale. I would ask your friend how she feels about used items....but if she doesnt mind then 30 bucks is a good deal for a swing if it runs fine and looks in good shape. Although for 30 more dollars you can buy a new one.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	You can buy things, but make sure you can return them JUST IN CASE. It still very early and the first trimester is very iffy. Buy things for her and hold on to them for her baby shower. And, yes, $30 is a very good price for a swing. How much is the shipping though and what condition is it in? If it's used, you can probably buy a new one at Babies R Us or Baby Depot (Burlington Coat Factory) for 50 or 60 bucks.|`|bmoCpcdraa	the swing is an average price, it is not to early ,the more time goes by the more stress she will have if she needs this or that. she won't need a swing till the baby is about 3 or 4 months old , she needs a bassenet sooner glass bottles they are better to boil for the first 4 mo.s ,hope i helped|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	the swing sounds like a good pric but i would say that it is a bit to early she is still at risk for a miscarrige <br>  wait until she is 12 weeks <br>  3 months and buy her and the baby a u made it past the danger zone gift or something|`|f949a6440379e23438eb10c50bdfb4abaa	I waited until I knew if I was having a boy or girl then started buying everything!!! The price on the swing is pretty good...but check to see the features. I paid about $85 for my swing - it is run off of a wall plug in (NOT battery) and plays songs while it swings baby on choice of 6 speeds. Also make sure the condition is good if you buy used, and make sure if you do buy used you sanitize before the new baby uses it! Lastly, make sure that there are no recalls on that swing, espicially if it is an older model. It is exciting to buy for babies!!! I know (I just had one)...good luck to you and your friend!!|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	Thats REALLY cheap!  I would look at the reviews about it before buying it to make sure its safe.  It's not to early to buy little things but I would personally wait. I'm 4 months and haven't bought anything yet and when I was pregnant with my son I waited untill 5 or 6 months also. It's better once you know the sex of the baby.  Good luck to her!|`|BMfn0D9gaa	It seems like I started buying around that time.  I did it so that when it was time for the baby to come it didn't seem like I had to go out and spend a bunch of money cause I bought along the way.  I wouldn't buy too much though, what about a baby shower?  also try consignment stores like Kid To Kid and Once Upon A Child, if you have them, they are really good for saving money.  I would actually look at buying a swing there, it might be cheaper!  Congrats to your friend!|`|02SG8Dchaa	yeah the swing is a deal but its an ok idea to buy stuff all throughout the pregnancy but whats better is to save ur money up until the end and buy stuff when u are like 6 or seventh months along god forbid if something bad happened and then u had all that baby ****. i got my stuff after the shower i had at 8 months to buy what i hadnt recieved|`|FIOOKpz0aa	I don't think its too early, especially because the closer it gets to the baby being born the more money will be put towards things for the baby, and the less money she'll have coming in if shes currently working. I'd say go for it, it can't hurt anything!|`|d0ddKfnCaa	Yes its okay to start buying baby stuff right away.  However since it is too early to know what sex the baby is definitely get neutral things.<br>  www.SamaKiTush.com has some super cute baby things that you might want to check out.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	it would be neat to buy her one or two small things...a onesie, or a blankie.  but dont go crazy yet.  if she miscarries, i dont think she will want a house full of baby stuff.|`|BDarMnDeaa	I was out buying things before I was 2 months pregnant! LOL|`|elx4NP4xaa	$30 for a baby swing is a good price. I started early buying baby stuff. I knew if I waited till the baby was born I wouldn't have the time to go shopping around for baby things.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	yeah i started buying bottles and little things right away, when i found out  what i was having i started buying some items, most of everything came from the baby shower|`|iMULlxdgaa	Well if you guys see good deals out there...definately take 'em while the price is hot. otherwise with clothes and stuff I would take my time, becuas etrust me she will get sooooooooooooo bored by the time she's 9 months and ready to pop you'll guys will need something to do in the end,  so save some stuff for the end.
05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	I would look at it this way, most of the time we worry & fret over things that never happen. My oldest daughter is 34, 35 this year & my youngest is 28,29 this year. I went threw the shot thing as you are but not for the same reason. This the first I've heard that vaccinations cause Autism, if I would of heard of it at the time my girls were needing their shots, I would of freaked more then I did.<br>  Both my girls received all their shots with no problems. If I was in your position I think I would get the shots, we don't face the same enemies as far as disease goes today as yesterday. The conditions for more severe strains are a bigger today than the fear of shots going wrong. When my girls got their shots it was something like 1 in 50,000 had severe reactions & I was hesitant to go ahead with them, but I did, & all turned out OK.<br>  I knew that my God would make sure my girls were OK, if not here this side of Armageddon, then after Armageddon. <br>  We are told to obey mans law unless they conflict with Gods, the shot thing is not conflicting with Gods law as far as I know.<br>  Look at the positive side, put off the shots as long as possible, it may be by the time law required for you to have the shots, a new order may be in place, if not, it will be here soon & at that time Jehovah will take care of your precious child & any shots that she will need or not need.<br>  Brother in Faith<br>  BroKen|`|oem5yEUDaa	The idea that vaccinations cause autism was proven wrong. It was also proven that the results of the studies were changed and played with to make it show that they did cause autism.<br>  <br>  Why do you think it is rare to catch the diseases that are vaccinated against? It's because they DO vaccinate against them. If everyone stops vaccinating they are going to make a come back. That may be sooner than you think, even when your child is an unvaccinated adult.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Autism is not caused by vaccines|`|jhjn1QVQaa	Many states have waivers for parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.  Check the laws in your state.|`|LsAArkUyaa	For those saying there is no link between Autism and vaccines.<br>  Actually the medical community is starting to come around. Many experts are now finding a connection. However it is believed that Autism will only occur if there is a genetic predisposition for autism. It is also believed that that there are other triggers.<br>  <br>  The daughter of a close friend had a seizure at age 5 from her vaccinations. Test have definitely showed that she has suffered some brain damage from the reaction to the vaccines.<br>  When she is seen by a new Dr who has not read her files, she is diagnosed with an Autism spectrum disorder.<br>  However once Drs see that she was "normal" at age 5 they quickly change the diagnosis to unknown<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: for those throwing out tha they or their adult children didn't have a problem with vaccines as a reason to vaccinate:<br>  A child born in 2000 will receive 9x the vaccines of a child that was born in the late 1960-early 1970s over the course of their childhood.|`|apSTH4TIaa	I have an autistic child, and I think you should vaccinate her.  I also have 3 other normal children.  All had the same shots at the same stages of development.  Vaccines do not cause autism.  It is a fact that Japan doesn't even vaccinate with the MMR which was at the top of the debate and they have seen an increase in autism because it is caused by some other factor.  Scientists belive there is a genetic link to autism (my brother also has a son who is autistic) and that these kids are predisposed to it.  I don't think you should be worrying about the vaccines.  The fact is that unvaccinated people come into our county while travelling all the time and the vaccinated people don't really have to worry about it, but those who aren't vaccinating their children will be dealing not only with deadly diseases but probably misdiagnosis too because doctors rarely see measeles, mumps, and polio just to name a few.  Her immune system should be ready for shots by 21 months.  Talk it over with her pediatritian.|`|hSJnaysiaa	If a school receives state funding shots are required for entry.<br>  <br>  So, if your daughter has not been vaccinated by the time she is ready for school, you'll either need to find a school who will accept her without shots (a school that doesn't receive funding) or plan to homeschool.<br>  <br>  There are reasons these rules are in place. And while I commend you for doing what you feel is best for your child, what you think is in her best interest could potentially harm other kids if she did catch something, so better to be safe than sorry and keep her away from them. And truth be told, those diseases they vaccinate for aren't as uncommon as one may think (and are on the rise due to many parents choosing to not vaccinate). You may be in charge of where YOUR daughter goes and what she does, but consider the grocery store. There are so many people there, and any of them could have these diseases. Especially considering the illegals that come to this country and god only knows what diseases they bring with them.<br>  <br>  So I don't know all the facts about autism and whatnot, but I'd rather be safe than sorry and not have my child living in a bubble to keep her safe. I do know that Autism can be lived with if it occurs whereas death occurs upon many of the diseases they vaccinate against. I'd rather have an autistic child than a dead one.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	First of all, I'm glad you didn't vaccinate your child. Yes, autism can be a result of them - so can brain damage, seizures, and death (notice how SIDS deaths increased at the same time as the DPT shot was introduced?). I am not in favor of them at ALL. Not only can they cause horrible side effects, half of children who contract the childhood diseases we vaccinate against are children who got the vaccine. So, the vaccines don't even work.<br>  <br>  You can get the vaccine paper notarized at a notary office, and then your child doesn't have to get the shots. States will claim it is a law, but it really isn't.<br>  <br>  Don't get them when she is older either. Honestly, the side effects are not worth it, especially because kids who get the vaccine are no less likely to contract the disease than kids who don't get the vaccine.<br>  <br>  And, for all you parents and people out there reading this who are "outraged" that someone would put YOUR vaccinated child in danger by not vaccinating THEIR child... if you really think the vaccines work, then your child will not get the disease, regardless of whether other children are vaccinated or not.|`|OuXnOkZuaa	I don't think you can "deal" with the school. States mandate vaccinations so you would have to home school your child if she is not vaccinated. There is nothing you can do..to deal with the school, in their view they are protecting the school children from diseases and anyone who is not vaccinated cannot attend public schools. Even the children who have most vaccinations, and there is a date at which time they need to update and they do not or have yet to, then the child will not be allowed to attend again until they are up to date. Good Luck|`|Stpf8DPRaa	Whatever your reason for choosing not to vaccinate, it's your choice that you are making for you and your family.  Please do not take to heart the ignorant, hateful comments of others...everyone wants to judge when they should really be looking at themselves.  I have chosen not to vaccinate my 3 children, ages 6, 7 and 11 for many reasons.  All in public school and doing fine.  Even though shots are "required", almost all state give exemptions for school admission when the reasoning is stated as "against religious beliefs".  If you do some googling, you should find the law and proper phrasing which you can then pretty much copy and paste.  There are many good websites for supporting parents that choose not to vaccinate.  As long as you have educated yourself as much as possible on making these important decisions, it's ultimately your choice.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	I would not want my children around your child, or in my class room.<br>  I have no idea where you got your information from. All what you have told us here is not true. I am so sure you would feel so bad, if your child contacted a preventable disease and became disabled or even died.<br>  Go have your child vaccinated as soon as possible. Don't be a mom to a very tragic happening. If you love your child you don't need anything tragic to happen.<br>  None of my 5th graders who are 10 years in age on average, have had any problems and they have just received their 10 year booster shots at school in January.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|G2auAv1Saa	You will need to get with your local health department offices and get an exemption form to provide to the school. <br>  Your child and what is injected into her is completely your business but, there have been new studies released in the past few weeks that has shown no link of autism and vaccines. I will try to find a link for you, but it is your own decision. <br>  With that being said- you are about to have some angry mommies on you in less than 2.5 seconds, im sorry :(<br>  <br>  edit: Some of you are saying you are putting other vaccinated children at risk. If you believe vaccines work against protecting disease to the vaccinated child then how would the disease be spread to them by an unvaccinated child? This is my understanding of the process, if you have a different insight would you please inform me.<br>  <br>  Ruddy: Smallpox has been completely eradicated since 1979 (the only disease to be completely eradicated) and child hood vaccines for it haven't been used since 1972 (in the US and Europe). Military members deploying to the middle east are the only ones to receive it. The last occuring case of small pox was in 1978 in Birmingham England. Are you saying you don't even know what you child is being injected with?!!! And if you know of current small pox outbreaks would you please alert the WHO- I imagine they would be very interested and you would be a rich woman for discovering this big lie of it being eradicated.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	People have already confirmed there is no relation between autism and vaccination.  I just don't understand why people worry about vaccination too much, even it does cause autism (which obviously isn't the case), it isn't deadly.  But you can catch a disease that can kill your kid in days without the vaccination.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Dont know how they would do that but i know i wouldnt want my child around kids that were not vaccinated. I would take my chances because you never know, i wouldnt want my child dying because of something i could have prevented.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Please get your child vaccinated.  You don't catch autism, but you can catch polio.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I know I would rather live with my child having autism (which is rare) than have to live with knowing I could have prevented the illness that killed them. Not to mention, by not vaccinating children, this part of the world is opening up themselves to super-strains of these potentially deadly and debilitating diseases (it's like not taking all prescribed antibiotics helps breed antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria therefore leading to more deaths from bacterias that could have been iradicated). Did you know that it's because of all the parents refusing to vaccinate their children that the United States is seeing cases of small pox and measles that we haven't in many years? Instead of turning up our noses at vaccines we need to petition for safer vaccinations that will protect children without the risk of autism and other reactions. That said, I had an instructor for anatomy and physiology in college who was a naturopathic doctor who chose to deny vaccines until her daughter was two years of age and her immune system was fully developed before having her vaccinated. The child handled the vaccines very well and is perfectly healthy- and enjoys the benefits of going to school. I would recommend waiting until she's two and then vaccinating; but please do (although it is your choice) by vaccinating her you could help children who were already vaccinated stay healthy and free from disease.
NAkQdoYlaa	Maybe low blood pressure, I'm not pregnant but I get dizzy often. Just make sure you keep eating throughout the day and stay hydrated.

A friend of mine (during her second pregnancy) developed boarder line gestational disbetes. As it was her second pregnancy, she was a little more complaicent and not worried about every little change. <br>  Head for the doctors and get your sugars checked (if you havent already) and see if  barley sugar or fresh juice to have regularly to keep your sugars up works in the mean time.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Could be low iron in your blood, or just low nutrients all together because if you don't "eat for two" you and your baby aren't getting enough nutrition|`|98WKYtfwaa	Have you had your blood pressure and iron levels checked recently? Dizziness is common in pregnancy because of the increased blood flow, so if your not anaemic and your blood pressure isn't high/low then you're fine. <br>  <br>  You should notify your doctor/midwife or whoever looks after you about this though, they might want to run some tests to be sure you're levels are good and if not then it's good to inform them of such symptoms.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Probably low blood pressure - mention it to your Dr.<br>  <br>  Stay hydrated, and try not to be on your feet too long|`|tk4PLUvnaa	Perhaps it's because the room is spinning.

But it could also be due to your blood pressure, if dizziness keeps happening, consider going to your doctor to get a checkup.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	Talk to your Doctor, yes it could could be low blood pressure but it could also be low iron, not a good thing for a pregnant woman or the baby. There are many other causes of dizziness and you need to exclude serious things. Could you forgive yourself if you fainted and landed on your tummy causing injury to your bub? Get checked out, the risk is not worth delaying it. Good Luck!|`|d1862ba8e4c727c54e3035f0293c5a14aa	You should call your doctor and ask them if they think you should come in to get checked out. Also, I'd suggest you take your blood pressure when this happens. My dad has low blood pressure and gets dizzy from it. So just an idea to see if yours is low when this happens.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	i felt dizzy a couple times in my pregnancy and i had gestational diabetes...i usually would just rest and put my feet up and drink some water and i would be fine.|`|BBTnM1p7aa	It's probably the feeling you have inside of your throat, like you're thinking about having the baby. Maybe you just have some stress, just lay off and relax a little. Other than that it might just be something on your mind.|`|BGIxDWkZaa	Please consult your doctor.

WPI0Z47saa	Yes the symptoms of early pregnancy and your period coming on can be the same in the beginning. However if you have a low hormone level then it won't register on a urine test right away. Mine took 7 weeks to register on a urine test. If you haven't gotten your period yet and aren't late then it was too early to test anyway and your chances of a false negative are really high.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	yes you can have the same feelings during very early pregnancy as having your period, but 11 days into conception you wouldn't feel anything..the cells have not even finished splitting for goodness sakes..|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Yep - early pregnancy symptoms are very similar to those of your period.<br>  <br>  Wait another week and test

Many generations ago, when life expectancy was only 35 - 40, human beings did marry and have kids earlier. Now we live longer, have a bigger choice of lifestyles, and society says 14 is too young. You would not be financially or emotionally able to cope in the modern world. And why hurry? Your life expectancy is probably about 80 years. So keep up the babysitting, knowing you can hand the kids back. Enjoy your youth and wait till you are in the right relationship and circumstances to properly care for a child. It's not wrong to have instincts, but our highly developed brains mean we can rise above them.|`|OHfZFR31aa	How would you financially support a child at age 14? You can't make enough money babysitting to be able to keep your kid in diapers, clothes, formula, baby food, etc as well as baby furniture. And think of all the things you wouldn't be able to do if you had a baby now. You wouldn't be able to hang out with your friends whenever you wanted to. You couldn't go out on weekends. You couldn't sleep in during school hoildays. etc. You would have to take care of that child 24 hours a day until it was old enough to go to school|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Yeah, it is normal to feel that way, most women do!  But as long as you know that you are too young now to have a child then you are fine.

nAvvthR1aa	If used correctly they are 99% effective. They are a very good form of birth control if you take all of them and take them when you are supposed to. It depends the prices vary with what kind it is obviously a popular brand such as Yaz would be more expensive then a off brand but usually its anywhere from 20 to 40 a month. Sometimes my breasts are tender and it seems like i am more hungry. I got birth control because i have a ovarian cyst and also my periods were very heavy and painful and the birth control reduced the size of my cyst and made my periods lighter and less painful so those are some good side effects but other than that there is really nothing else that effects me! <br>  Try it i love it...If you cant remember to take the pill everyday there is other options such as the Nuva ring which is changed once a month,the patch which is changed once a week, and the shot which is given every 3 months ..those are some more practical options if your one of the women who would have a hard time remembering to take the pill everyday at the same time because if you don't it is not as effective. For me its not a issue but it is all about you and what is best for you..Make a appointment with a OBGYN and she/he can talk to you about all your options and what is best for you personally also they will talk about other side effects with you. Hope this helped !|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Most birth control pills are about 99% effective, some cost about $20-$30/mth.  There are lots of different side effects for each kind, but I never had any.<br>  <br>  It would be best to talk to your doctor about side effects, or check on some websites for birth control such as www.nuvaring.com and just google others.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	ive been on birth control for about 5 years..never gotten pregnant.  i think they are like 99% effective if u use them right.  theyre not covered by my new health insurance so as of now they are about 60 bucks a month..before when they were covered i only paid i think like 5 dollars.|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	every time I was on birth control pills, I never got pregnant, (2 years) and then as soon as we tried for a baby, I got off the pill and was pregnant next month. it has been working excellent. i'm on the ''mini pill'' progestin only|`|UYaWH7a0aa	There are SO many different kinds of pills, each have varying levels of hormones in them so each type/brand may affect you differently. Some common side effects of the pill in general is spottting in between periods, mood swings, cramps, etc etc. Again checking wiht your doctor is the best way to find out which pill is right for you and what the risks associated with that pill are. <br>  <br>  For cost: Check with your insurance company. They may only cover some brands so those uncovered brands will cost you much more, while a covered brand may cost $20 for each pack.|`|0510e4a68a5997260ee0b82f69842cfaaa	I was on the pill and taking it ritualisticly at the same time every day for about  3 years without using condoms and got pregnant. Not 100% effective but use with a condom pretty much rules out pregnancy. My daughter is 6 now and we haven't had any scares since we use both types of contraceptive now.|`|qjy5OirNaa	99.9% usually but its all up to the brand|`|1OMpG5cPaa	Which one ar eyou taking ? There is so many of them <br>  You must wear a condom and take a pill  if you are not 30 yr old|`|n43DN6Duaa	check the back of the box.. tells u how effective they are.x|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	It depends on the type of pill.  The product information that comes with your prescription will tell you just how effective they are.  For the traditional Ortho TriCyclen, the effectiveness is in the neighborhood of 98% if taken perfectly.<br>  <br>  Remember, the only 100% effective birth control is not actually having sex, but you can get very very close by using a hormonal birth control and a barrier method like a condom.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you are young it is best to use a condom in conjunction with the pill because both are often not used correctly and only one prevents against STD's.<br>  <br>  Another option would be an IUD, such as Mirena.  They are safe and last for years.  The big drawbacks to these are the cost.  If not covered by insurance, Mirena is well over $500, which works out to more than $100/year since it lasts for 5 years.  I don't know how much the 10-year IUD costs.  This is still less expensive than chemical birth control without a prescription.<br>  <br>  Ortho TryCyclen Lo costs in the neighborhood of $50 each 28-day cycle if you do not have insurance.  I can't speak to how much the others cost, but insurance co-pays will be between $10 and $25 a month.<br>  <br>  Another popular birth control method worth mentioning is Depo-Provera, "the shot."  It's worth considering and is very effective when you consistently make your 3-month appointments.<br>  <br>  You can visit the websites of the major birth control producers to receive more information about how they work, how effective they are, potential side effects, and often to get a coupon for your first cycle.
SHBpzAIZaa	O sweetie I know how you feel... and I know that really pisses me off when people say that to me because I wanna just scream no you dont know how I feel because you can have children with no problems at all! I have been TTC # 1 for over 4 years now with absolutely no success... So yea I know how stressful this can be. I actually posted the almost exact same question yesterday because I was so down and upset... I just have those days after AF comes... <br>  I know that God will give me a baby when the time is right to him... I just think that time should be now. It makes me so mad to see these 14 and 15 year old children having babies and even worse seeing these druggies having babies and they dont even want them at all... There are things that we dont understand in this world and this is for sure one of those things... <br>  I wish you luck hun... and just pray about it and hopefully things will happen for you... Remember, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE!|`|GG9G37ojaa	Hey there,<br>  this website might help you: <a href="http://phaze.me/OvercomeInfertility" rel="nofollow">http://phaze.me/OvercomeInfertility</a><br>  <br>  I got it from a TTC forum when I was asking How to conceive questions.|`|Mpu8x3P4aa	hi im so sorry but hope this might help alittle i was diagnosed with pcos when i was 18 my 1st husband and i tryed for bout a year for baby number 1 then went to doc he sent me to the hospital where i was put on chlomid i think it was the 3rd cycle that i conceived then with baby number 2 it was the 2nd cycle me and my husband split and got divorced and 6 years later i met my soul mate although we weren't planning any more children 6 months in to the relationship i fell pregnant naturally it came as a massive shock for both of us but we were so happy we got married just over a year ago and the same has happened again im expecting our second so both chlomid and naturally has worked for me im sure it will happen chlomid was a total god send for me when i was trying for number 1 good luck xx|`|v7Xvow4Daa	Erica i feel for ya honey.<br>  <br>  my circumstances were a little different. My Dh has MS and he is on meds and we needed him to be off for a short as time as possible. My periods were every 46 days so we were referred for Clomid.<br>  <br>  I had to have an internal and a smear and she took cells for analysis. Also had to have a Ultrasound to check for PCOS and bloods done at certain times of my cycle.<br>  <br>  To cut a long story short by time i had got to fertility Dr i had got pregnant on my own... although it was only a matter of days maybe 6 days. But she did tell me i had ovulated by my blood results. Even thought the US could not see that i had ovulated!!!<br>  <br>  I had also started taking Angus Castus which i think helped my conception. it's  herbal hing which lowered my cycle from 46 days to 36 days and i think that was how i managed to get preggo!!<br>  <br>  Your friend does not understand that every month you pray so hard that it is your month... take no notice if there not in the boat they don't understand!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with the rest of your TTC journey.... and enjoy it making babies should be fun!!!
ACTa6N5Naa	It is possible!! I would say take a test but maybe to early to tell!! Wish you luck!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Of corse it's a posibility that you could be pregnant. I am 6 weeks pregnant and i don't have those symptoms but i have had bloating, implantation bleeding, sore bleeding gums and my fingernails are growing at a rapid rate.... This is my 5th pregnancy so usually with 2 pregnancies and more the sore boobs/nipples feeling decreases. Good luck to you and i wish you baby dust....Oh and you could test with an early HPT but if you get a BFN wait until 2 days past your periods due date and test again.|`|vACNWfeWaa	Not to be negative but it could be AF.  If you can't "get enough" like you stated, then I'm assuming it was unprotected.  Sperm can discharge up to 24 hours of intercourse so what you think might be cm could be the sperm.  Good luck though!|`|zjxr6fRsaa	sounds like if....Good  Luck!|`|SYbJeHNBaa	It could be however I am not sure if I felt any symptoms so early on in pregnancies, except however I noticed around 10DPO that I hadnt been to the loo for a number 2 and thats what got me thinking. Pregnancy can cause constipation!<br>  <br>  All of the symptoms you describe could be an impending visit from AF, although I can relate to the increased sex drive in pregnancy.  First Response pregnancy tests show up pregnancy 5 days before your period day is due, why not keep a sample of your morning urine in a cup, and pop to the drugstore to pick a test up.  All the best and baby dust! x|`|txSiQc7Waa	Everyone's advice is always test test test. Yes, your symptoms do sound like they could be caused by pregnancy, or by PMS. But you know your body better than anyone else so if you're experiencing something new. Then new=different=could be pregnant. :) My advice is to wait on testing until at least a day after your missed period. Even though the box may say it can detect hcg so fast, it doesn't mean your body will actually have enough hcg for it to detect. If you implant late, your hcg levels rise late. So save yourself a little heartache and wait to test :) False negatives can really get ya down! Good luck to you and tons of baby dust!|`|xYv4dfVQaa	Very well could be.  I would suggest to go ahead and take a home pregnancy test.|`|VdnAH78Xaa	sounds like it to me.<br>  those are the symptoms i had
0hxK0khKaa	It's an excellent name. I would associate it with someone who is beautiful and smart, because my sister is a beautiful, smart, strong woman and that is her name. Her name is Nicole Heather, if you like it you can use it.|`|6m6LjAVNaa	Yes it is lovely,my son Daniels fiancee is named <br>  Nicole Elizabeth<br>  She is beautiful and smart,very dark skin,brown eyes and jet black hair,Graduated from college with her bachelors degree in plastic engineering and is working two jobs and going for her masters,the wedding is September 5th 2009.<br>  Nicki and Daniel have been together almost 9 years and engaged for over 2 years.|`|AA12209656	one of my good friends is names Nicole. She's 20. She is very beautiful! she is Peruvian and looks like a victoria's secret model! and she is extremely smart... taking all honors classes in high school and having a 4.0 and was involved in art and track.  she is one of those girls thats good at sports, but yet still girly. and she is very independent but grounded at the same time. So Nicole is a good one for me.|`|JkC7nj7laa	i know a girl whos name is Nicole and she is 6 ft. and 13 and very ugly. and not smart at all so when i hear that name thats wut i think of no offense...|`|AA12127693	Yes it is -|`|RnB6D6ZYaa	My name is Nicole, and I am a 13 year old 6 foot tall ugly girl.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	nicole is a good name.......alll...wel i shouldnt say all....but most names are good....or ameerah..it means princess.......in sum other language which i do not rember|`|tkQq5tR1aa	The name of a person does not define them. Their deeds do.|`|nwkk4tnDaa	Yes I associate Nicole with beautiful and smart, I really admire a lady named that. However, my sister's name is Nicole and she is called Nicky and that seems immature and ditzy to me. But Nicole is a beautiful name, just not the nickname.|`|m3voWLhqaa	i'm not a big fan of the name, but it's what you like that matters but i will say this, it is a very common name, and being that my name is brittany, i know how much it sucks to have a common name!!!|`|WQ8P57o3aa	I really don't like the name Nicole..<br>  Reminds me of either dim bimbos or nasty bullies. I was bullied as a child by a girl called Nicole...and I just don't like it.|`|vdVVZiY6aa	Its a good name, but seems a bit overused too me, I don't know about everyone else, but it is where I live anyway.  But I do Like it=]|`|ValLVBcYaa	It's okay but way too over used.<br>  <br>  How about ''Nicola''? Pronounced Nick-uh-lah|`|BwGyVnB1aa	I think its a pretty name. The only probably is I know alot of people named nicole. It seems to be extremely popular.|`|YL1evGq3aa	Nicole kind of sounds like a girl with a nasal voice. If she goes by nikki it would be cool|`|GInSlNYcaa	It's okay, but I think it's too common, especially as a middle name.|`|KW7OSnOxaa	IM SORRY I HAVE ONLY KNOWN 3 NICOLES IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER, BUT I DON'T CARE FOR ANY OF THEM AT ALL|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I love it. It's one of the choices for a middle name if I have a girl!|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I think it is too common, and I like it spelled Nichole|`|J3gslQMCaa	i do!!!|`|Za5oxiBcaa	It's a pretty name but it's very common.. depends if you mind or not?|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think Nicole is very pretty. I found most Nicole very caring people|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I associate it with my best friend in JR high who stole my boyfriend and made out with him in front of my house!  Everybody associates a name with something...........its what you like that matters.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	It's an okay name, I don't really care for it. I think of either Nicole Richie, who I like (but obviously don't know) or my sister in law who if <br>  f-ing crazy and sorry, but not beautiful. But you should name your child whatever you want. Either she will be beautiful and smart or she won't, doesn't matter what you name her.|`|sO1tkGunaa	My middle name is Nicole. I know a girl named Nicole, she goes by Nikki, and she's pretty and nice and outgoing.|`|i2xLDJaraa	I HATE IT!<br>  <br>  Sorry but I think it sounds trailer park.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Yes, I do. But that's my sister's middle name and she hates it, it's very common.
OgzHcNMsaa	I use Ivory Snow.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Anything without dyes or perfumes.  Typically called "free & clear" detergents here in the US.  I love the Arm & Hammer Essentials Free & Clear.  It's a brand made with plant based cleansers.<br>  <br>  Arm & Hammer is a brand name.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	Dreft, All free and clear, or anything without dyes and perfumes.  also, you can use any dryer sheets without dyes and perfumes.  i am in America, so you might not have Dreft and All over there, so anything that doesn't contain dye or perfume is ok.  really, sometimes i forget and use regular washing powder and my girls are fine.  the dye and perfume in washing powder isn't harmful to baby unless it irritates their skin.  if your baby doesn't have sensitive skin you might not even have to get a special powder.<br>  <br>  Arm and Hammer is a kind of cleaning supplies here in America.  they make washing powder, too.  you're not being stupid!  i'm sure there are things in the UK that i don't know of either!<br>  <br>  edit:  Dreft is a brand of baby washing powder.|`|hWe8vhKKaa	i use fairy its smells so nice and its so soft.|`|eytlIKITaa	Dreft!  It's a bit more $ but worth it!  : )|`|6cwJi5kxaa	dreft. thats all you need.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	I have a 4 year old and a 7 month old and we used to use ariel non bio but my eldest had really bad ecsema and the ariel did him no favours but i'd tried daz non bio and a few others and nothing helped so i thought it was just his skin type and had nothing to do with the washing powder but when my youngest was born 7 months ago i got the bounty pack at the hospital with lots of little testers in it. When we got home i tried them all to see which one i liked the smell of the best at Fairy non bio and fairy softner had the best smell so we started using that then all of a sudden my 4 year olds skin has cleared up and my youngest has never had any bad skin...coinscidence, maybe but i think not!<br>  <br>  x|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	well, mine has really sensitive skin and we had to switch off the cheap powder kind and we use the arm and hammer sensitive skin.  so if you really wanted to use a powder i would suggest getting an arm and hammer one with no added dyes or perfumes.|`|NiZMDfTfaa	I use All Free and Clear.  I agree that anything that is free of perfumes and dyes will work.  <br>  <br>  Dreft is an expensive "baby" detergent in the US.  I don't think it is necessary.  Arm & Hammer is just a brand type here.|`|46K4FtE0aa	I have never gone wrong with Acdo, it is available from B&M and also Asda. I used it in the 60s for all my 3 children and it is still available now, i saw it only yesterday in B&M.|`|AA12257785	iv always used fairy washing powder and conditioner its so soft for baby's skin good luck|`|JXFYdTqmaa	fairy|`|HkpMFkQBaa	I Use Fairy, Its Kind To Baby's Skin And It Smells Really Nice :]|`|qdP5WAMgaa	anything that says free and clear is good, until they are older|`|AA11791151	Dreft or All - Free Clear I would not suggest any conditioner or dryer sheets and if you iron the clothes do not use any spray starch.
Nq8fhhRPaa	My son was also 8lbs 9oz when he was born. At 4 months the only weighed 10 lbs 11oz, which is very small, but developmentally he was way ahead. . Just remember that as long as your son is healthy he is fine. There is a large range of normal.|`|pXSKSS3daa	At 4 months he was 17.1 lbs. He was 7.3 lbs. at birth.<br>  <br>  IF your son did weigh 21 lbs. now he would be above the 95th percentile for boys his age. Meaning he weighs more than 95 percent. It's not average but it's certainly not unheard of either.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	My son wore 6-9 months stuff at 4 months too. He was 18 pounds, he is only 21 pounds now though and he is 8 months old. <br>  They tend to stop growing as rapidly|`|BMfn0D9gaa	at 2 months he was 17 lbs.?  that does seem to be a little big.  But i am no doctor, just ask when you go in March.  My baby just went to the doctor monday and she is 18 lbs. 1.5 oz. and 28 in. long.  She is also almost 8 months old and in the 62th % for weight and 90% for height!|`|tdHIR9cLaa	oh my he is a big boy! My son was 9lbs 1oz and 21 1/4 inches at birth and he weighed 15lbs when he was 4 months he is now 5 months, and i am sure he only gained a pound.|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Wow! My daughter is 4 1/2 months and at her 4 month check up she was 13 lbs 4oz. She was 4lbs 13oz at birth!|`|CBJge2kxaa	i have a 4 month old girl and she is the same was  almost 10 lbs at birth and is now in 9 month clothing which are pushing it as well, lol the 12 month are fitting very well, don't worry they plateau at some point my other daughter was big too and still is height wise now she is 5 but she is starting to level out and other kids are catching up.  Don't you love a big cuddly baby to hold and not worry so much about tiny little frail arms and legs?|`|Ug5twRBDaa	My son was 18 lbs 7 oz at his 4 month check-up (which was 2 weeks late) and 27 inches tall. he was in the 97th percentile for both height and weight! Congrats you have a big boy too!!! =)|`|pVaZty4Maa	my son is 16lbs and 14 onces, only bc he just got over a virus and he didn't eat much at that time and he lost about 1lb.  he just started wearing 6-9 month clothing
GzpkA8HFaa	You could be. I would take a home pregnancy test to be sure, which can be bought for a dollar at many $1 stores, or you could go to planned parenthood. A late period can be caused by other factors as well, such as stress.|`|EV2LMaiLaa	ask your doctor why ask people on here|`|YlLmAADraa	if you had a period after the last time you had sex then no you woulnd't be pregnant.<br>  <br>  period=not pregnant|`|Vkk9KzC1aa	probably but to make sure. go get some of those pregnancy tester thing
WlU3NFu6aa	what do you do with tissue paper and bras?<br>  <br>  cucumbers, a highlighter. thats all i can come up with.<br>  <br>  seriously. what DO you do with tissue paper??|`|ANHsv4ENaa	A-1 steak sauce, washing machine, twist ties, pillows and duck tape! My favorites.|`|AA11296427	What, wait. TISSUE PAPER? LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mmm, your hand? Whatever feels good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	Seriously, what do you do with tissue paper and bras?<br>  <br>  Cucumber, hand-held shower head.|`|MczmTftTaa	Watermelons and cucumbers.|`|Btsctjydaa	A strap-on 50 gallon water heater seems to work for most of these questions.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	wow u have a list there..<br>  hm...have u tried a shower?<br>  i.e getting the water running against ur vagina and that gives ultimate pleasure..<br>  try that :)<br>  apart from that..i have no idea sorry :)<br>  take care :)<br>  xoxo|`|876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	lmao tissue paper???? never heard of that before haha you should talk to your partner about it...they may have some tips if you guys are open
K1JKOGo9aa	LOL i'm only 12 weeks and I'm already having to buy bigger bra sizes.  Everyone tells me it's only gonna get worse! I know my poor mom had a pair of double D's at least when she was pregnant.  She had to wear a special bra and a brace because she was having horrible back pain.|`|is9x38oLaa	I am 35 weeks tomorrow and i still wear my normal bra|`|AA10939306	My boobs grew 1 size with each child. So I went from a B to a D. My husband loves it! I miss my B's. Not sure about broadening across the back. Seems like mine did but it will go back down if you lose your baby fat.|`|yLIvQuJ1aa	OMG 32G!!<br>  <br>  You're going to have door knockers when you get done with that kid.
cAtWxJG1aa	we have been through 5 pediatricians with various moves, some dissatisfaction with one pediatrician, and some pediatricians who have moved on themselves.  Two out of the four pediatricians who we ended up "losing" were amazingly wonderful and it was a serious bummer to lose them.  The good news is that we're once again with such a person.  I don't know the odds of that, but we've certainly been lucky.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Ask your current pediatrician if he can recommend one in the new area or on the new health plan.  Chances are he has a colleague who he admires & respects who does take your new insurance.|`|AA11481889	Do you have any friends that would let you use their address to be able to "stay in the county"?<br>  <br>  I know it's kinda shady...but that's how people get around school district issues and the like, around here.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	is it possible to pay the pediatrician cash and then have your insurance company reimburse you?<br>  <br>  this is what *my* dr does. (not my kids' dr)|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would look for a new insurance or just occasionally go see the doctor to say hello.|`|Btsctjydaa	Give him a send-off BJ.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	somewhat.. i just moved into the city from the suburbs and had to leave my ped.. he was great.. and i met him by chance.. really thorough and always explained things to me, so i knew for the future.. So now ive just asked my friends who live here, or other moms in this area for recommendations for a new ped.. as sad as it is.. there are plenty of others out there who will do the job just as well..|`|AA12145826	Is it possible your pediatrician could recommend a new one for you? That's what we asked our pediatrician when we moved and he gave us the name of a friend of his who turned out to be just as wonderful.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	You have two choices.  Keep the doctor you have and pay for an "out of network provider"<br>  <br>  Find a different insurance.<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Deal with it.
xtYTbUxGaa	Personally, I would definitely choose a name I fell in love with because although your family (obviously) plays a HUGE role in your life, this is YOUR baby, and you should pick a name for her that you absolutely love. To some, it might be important to carry on tradition and use the same family name that everyone else has already used, but I would so much rather pick a middle name that flows with the baby's first/last name and that I love. Your great-grandma and sister can still play a big part in your daughter's life, but they don't necessarily have to influence your daughter's name. Choose the one that you love :)|`|XRCGaQW5aa	I would probably tell them to choose the name they fell in love with. I dont think that family names are that important but thats just me. Actually this is kind of what I am going through we have two boy names picked out one is Andrew the other is Liam, Andrew would be after my great grandfather and my little brother, but we just fell in love with Liam we will probably pick Liam over Andrew.|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	Well, my middle name is a family one, but it also happens to be the month I was born in...so you can see the jokes.  I love that its unique, but it gets to be a pain when I have to spell it.  May vs Mae (which is how its spelled)  I know my mom wants me to name my little girl with my middle name, but I just don't want to do that to her.  Besides, its me, and two other cousins with the same middle name!  I'd say to do what makes you happy and that is what is important.  Honestly... Lillian Estelle  has too many "L" sounds, doesn't sound right to me.  But that is just my thoughts!|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I would say - use both! If it was important to use a family name - use part as the middle name. And if you fell in love with a name, use that one too.<br>  <br>  Best of both worlds. <br>  <br>  Just don't hyphenate the first name - I hate that. Or give the child 2 middle names...sheesh.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion :o)|`|3KoGUAfLaa	I agree. Do the family name as its first, then the name you fell in love with as its second. Then when the baby arrives, call it by its middle name. Ha ha ha ha you win!|`|47M20WOUaa	I say go with your heart if you love the name then your family should support your decision :)|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I'd tell them to use the name they liked the most.|`|AA11138222	I think combining the two, such as using a favorite name for the first, and a family name for the middle would be the best suggestion for someone if they had this dilemma.<br>  <br>  The importance of a family name varies depending on the family. Some families have deep rooted traditions in which the first son is named after their grandfather, or the first daughter after her aunt, etc. Other families choose not to carry names on at all, or don't care either way.<br>  <br>  I'm actually planning on combining the two myself, and picking out a first name that I love, and using a family name for the middle name.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Personally Lillian Estella is cuter than Lillian Estelle. I would use the family name or both (Lillian Estella Taylor)|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	It really depends on how important the family name is to YOU - not the rest of the family.  Personally, I like to choose a name based on what I think the personality of the child will be - if the name "fits" him/her, that's the one I'd go with and if there's a family name that "had" to be in there, it'd be the middle name if not the first.<br>  EDIT:  Above...go with Liam Andrew!! nice!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I would use the family name.  I am in the same situation.  My husband's father is a great man and we want to honor him if we are blessed with a child together.  His name is Anthony but we call him Tony.  If it were to be a boy we will call him Jaxon Anthony and a girl we will call her Toni Danielle.  I think Toni for a girl is cute especially since it is after someone so special.  Even though there are other names I like I would prefer to honor him.<br>  <br>  Personally I like Lillian Estelle better|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I would tell them to combine the names (if they could be ones that sounded nice together) and use one as a first name and one as a middle name. If not then i would tell them to use the name they fell in love with, cuz to me i think it's more imprtant for the parent to love the name then for family significance, but if they really loved both names then i'd tell them to use the family name.<br>  For me if i had 2 names i was in love with and one was a family name and the other wasn't i would prolly either combine them or use the family name.<br>  <br>  Here's my namelist:<br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9665266" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9665266</a><br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Family name. I'm big on passing on family names, especially in the middle name spot!...Or just do a double middle name...like Lillian Taylor Estelle.

Relax, all they can do is give you a look. God forbid anyone said anything on that whenever I did that with my kids. They would get a real sweet smile and something along the lines of: it's just a suit.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	You can have both.  Get out of your suit before picking her up.  How messy can a 15-month old be???  If she has food all over her face, then wipe her up before cuddling her.  If her diaper is soiled, change her first.  <br>  <br>  Honey, you can have your cake and eat it, too.|`|E8WrncLoaa	Messy suits are washable. Babies love their attention. Food, especially on a kid's face/hands, will find its way to the one clean item of clothes you have. I would definitely rather have the suit to clean than the unhappy baby.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Neither. Tide to go. Keep one in my purse and in the junk drawer at home. I wear suits and hold the kid all the time. I work to live, not live to work.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	If the child is dirty enough to mess up the suit, don't pick them up until you change.  Most children aren't running around litterally covered in mudd 24/7|`|bghotovYaa	Messy suit.|`|ge3meKYEaa	I would wear an apron :)<br>  <br>  But messy suit wins.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	Messy suit!

9OKG0a5Baa	latin - meaning small. the feminine of paul.<br>  which is derived from the hebrew saul.<br>  <br>  oh and star- sarah is not hindu its hebrew. it means princess.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Meaning: Its source is a Latin expression meaning "Small." <br>  <br>  Languages: This girl's name is used in German, Dutch, English, Greek, Portuguese, Hungarian and Polish. <br>  <br>  Variant Forms: Lepaula, Paulena, Paulene, Pauletha, Pauletta, Paulette, Pauline, Paulinique, Paulisa, Paulita, Paoletta and Lapaula <br>  <br>  Non-English Forms: Paola, Paule, Pavla, Pola and Polina <br>  <br>  Popularity: The name Paula ranked 576th in popularity for females of all ages in a sample of 2000-2003 Social Security Administration statistics and 95th in popularity for females of all ages in a sample of the 1990 US Census. <br>  <br>  This name is highly rated in the 1990 U.S. Census popularity survey of all ages, but after 1960 does not appear in the state data listing the most popular baby names.<br>  <br>  Narrative: Though Paula was used among early Christians, no doubt to honor St. Paul, it was not used widely in English-speaking countries until the 20th century. In the interim, it was mainly identified as a German name.<br>  <br>  Paulina, another ancient Latin name, did come into use among English speakers in the 19th century; however, as Paula increased in popularity in Britain and America, the French forms Pauline and Paulette joined it in eclipsing the older name.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yup it's Latin.  And it means small, lol.  My oldest bro's name is Paul and it means the same thing, and it doesn't describe him at all lol.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/Names/name_display.php?id=3160" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/Names/name_display....</a>|`|jwIdq5qkaa	According to www.babynames.com Paula is latin, but on www.babynameaddicts.com It showing German, Old English, and Portuguese.

AA10186411	I named my daughter Madison.  Dreadfully popular, but I love the name, and it suits her wonderfully.  I don't care if its popular or not, if I like it, I'm sticking with it!|`|U1juqahIaa	I like unique names (but nothing crazy), and some family names.  I want my kids to have classy, beautiful names but without being trendy or popular or too old fashioned. I would use the more common names like Michael or Sophia in the middle name spot. William, Thomas, Isabelle, Elizabeth, Sienna, and Andrew are other names I love, but with the exception of Sienna, they are better as middle names.<br>  <br>  I refuse to use a popular name because I had an extremely popular name growing up (Laney is just my nickname). My name was the 3rd most popular name the year I was born and I hated it.  I had at least 3 or 4 other girls in my class with the same name as me and had to go by my first name plus last initial.   I want to give them a name that isn't popular so they don't have to go through the same thing I did.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I like a classy elegant name paired with a spunky name i.e. Lillian Taylor, I don't want my child to be one of five kids with the same name, I want my child to feel and be unique, we already have a rather boring and overly common last name: Brown!|`|dDVAUA9saa	Because I don't want my daughter to be one of 6 girls with the same name in her class.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I wouldn't use a name that was super popular because I wouldn't want my child to be one of the 6 Addison's in her kindergarten class or my son to be one of 5 Aiden's.  I would want them to have a more unique name - a name that tons of other children are less likely to have.<br>  <br>  I prefer names that are old, family names, and exotic sounding names - not trendy or popular for the times.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	I haaaaate popular names because I grew up with a horridly trendy name. I hate always having to be distinguished from all of the other Jessica's by my last name. I want my children to have names that are their own, so that they're not one of three or four in their class. My taste tends towards classic but unusual names (like Annora, Caroline, Violet, Cooper, Sawyer and William).|`|4FQKWxB9aa	Well my name is Jessica, I like my name but it is WAY too common, especially when i was in school, Someone would say jessica & like 10 people would answer.....<br>  My son will go through the same thing, His name is Kaden, Now there are Aidens, Haydens, Jadens, & Idk whatelse!<br>  I like more unique names, For that reason.<br>  <br>  But that's about it, if i truly love the name, how popular it is or what other people think of it won't matter, just mine & my fiance's opinions do!|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I guess it doesnt really matter, but it does get pretty annoying if there are a lot of people with the same name. In my class there were 3 brittneys, and we all had classes together, so it got very confusing. Plus, teachers never spelled it right. I honestly had one teacher that ever spelt my name Brittney, the way i spell it, everyone else spelt it Brittany. In my highschool, there were 7 brittney's in all! (Brittney x 2, Brittany x 2, Brittani, Brittni, and Britni!) There were only 200 kids in my highschool! Was crazy!|`|FQrl1Azbaa	i like traditional names, but not old fashioned ones. <br>  <br>  if a name is too popular, every time someone calls out "makenzie" half the class will look. will get frustrating!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I do kinda care. I have always loved Alyssa, but I think it's getting too commonplace now. I kinda want people to say "Oh wow! That's a beautiful name!" when the hear what I name my child.|`|ZC7frJBQaa	any! =D whatever i like id choose<br>  like:<br>  Lidia<br>  Tanya<br>  Catherine<br>  Siobhan !|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I dunno i've always thought the same thing, i think it's kinda silly to not use a name u really like just cuz it's so popular.  My fav girls name is Madison which is really popular now, but it wasn't when i started likin it, but i'm still gonna use it for my first daughters name (whenever i happen to have one, lol)  cuz i love the name so much, i don't care if it's popular or not.<br>  <br>  It depends i like names cuz of how they look and sound not really by if it's popular or trendy or whatnot, i think i have a good mix of names.  For middle names most of those are pretty common middle names.<br>  <br>  My fav names are:<br>  <br>  Girls -<br>  Madison Rose <br>  Gwendolyn Alexis <br>  Zoey Marie <br>  Skylar Zoey (my niece’s name) <br>  Kenadi Mae <br>  Kendall Grace<br>  Taylor Faith<br>  Abrianna Cheyenne <br>  Brielle Olivia<br>  Rylee Rae<br>  Jolee Faye<br>  Veda Alexandria <br>  Caprice Brianna <br>  <br>  Boys - <br>  Maddox Michael (my son's name - :D)<br>  Colton Thomas<br>  Griffin Alexander<br>  Arion Gabriel<br>  Talon Christopher<br>  Nolan Nathaniel<br>  Levi Lawrence (My nephew’s name)<br>  Broden Matthew<br>  Jaggar James<br>  Reagan Forrest<br>  Keifer Jackson<br>  Kaliff Noah<br>  Owen Oliver<br>  Liam Joseph<br>  Solon Ross<br>  Declan Wyatt (newest addition to my name list, just yes. Feb. 25th is when i added it lol)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|dn00Yw3taa	I actually prefer popular names to a degree.  My name is Heather and growing up in the 80's there were tons of Heather's but I always felt like I could fit in to a crowd because of my name.  I knew I'd never get teased because of it either.  So, I would like for my kid to feel the same way.  <br>  I do like trendy names but I like them a little unique but not very.<br>  I love bible names for boys.  I like names that are timeless to and classic.  For boys, masculine, classic, timeless, and biblical...maybe a little trendy.  For girls, has got to be feminie, I like princess names or names with antique charm, timeless.<br>  <br>  I like Michael, Micah, Noah, Daniel, David, Eli, but I also like Aiden, Caiden, and William.<br>  <br>  I like Grace, Emily, Victoria, Isabella, Sophia, Lily, Rose, Meredith|`|3S2gw8D1aa	Jennifer is the answer! How many Jennifer, Jenny, Jen, Jenna's do you know? I know so very many and so does everyone else. The sad thing is Jennifer is a lovely name and so is Jenna, but because every class had about eight Jennifers, it makes the name seem less appealing. People remember how frustrating it can be to be Jennifer P. for so many years of your life, so that is why popularity for some parents is a very big issue. My naming style is that I don't really have one (lol). I like a couple of traditional names and a couple of trendy ones and then I throw in some weird unique names, so I guess you could call my naming style mix and match. Fun question!|`|SPMr3ZJFaa	I think that most people who choose not to use a popular name that they like just don't want their kid to have the same name as 3 other kids in their class. (flashback to 5th grade when we had 3 Tylers; Tyler M, Tyler B, and when the third one came we just called him number 3)  On the other hand, some people will name their kid whatever they want as long as they like it.  So that is why...it's up to you to decide who is right.<br>  <br>  Now, just as a side thought...what confuses me is the people who pick a name BECAUSE it's popular...not because they like it but just because it made the top ten names list...that makes no sense to me.<br>  <br>  As for what names I like, I like traditional names...the ones we don't hear much anymore.  Old fashioned, but not old lady...(for example my daughter is named Collette which is not very common today, but I didn't go with Ethel which is also not common today but makes most people picture their grandma)|`|xtYTbUxGaa	I would name my baby a popular name if I liked the name. I prefer some older names (like Charlotte, Vivienne, AnaSofia, etc.), but I also like unique names (like Emerson or Tallulah). I think it's more important to actually like the name though, not just because it's uncommon or popular or whatever.|`|TXIyz7JQaa	I didn't want my daughter to be one of 10 Emma's in her class when she starts school.  My nephew is one of three Matthew's in his class and he just gets lumped together. <br>  Personal preference but it doesn't mean you can't name your kid whatever you want even if the name is popular.<br>  <br>  I prefer "vintage" names.  Old fashioned names that aren't weird.  Names like Victoria, Clara, Bennet and William are fav's of mine.|`|eJMIazhLaa	I like names that I like.  I do like popular names but I tend to like names that people don't really use all that often.  I don't know why, I just like them better. I don't think it really matters.  If you like the name, then why care what everybody else thinks about it.|`|47M20WOUaa	Honestly I like what I like and hate what I hate if I like a name then good but I like all kinds of name unique old fashion biblical some may be popular but some may not be but what it all boils down to is that you like the name of your child|`|0Ekd7Jtoaa	I'd want his name to be popular but not that popular! i wouldn't want him in school having the weirdiest name,but i also would'nt want him having the same name as 2 or 3 kids.|`|6v4Gblxkaa	If its popular, then the kid will be mistaken for another kid with the same name...........|`|850qv6g1aa	i like the name marisela. haha. and having the same name as everyone else can suck. like having the name maria... blows|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I always swore I'd never give my children a popular name.<br>  <br>  Baby #1... chose his name after seeing it on an on-line baby name site and had never heard the name before (Aidan)<br>  <br>  Baby #2... I figured we already have one popular name, why not 2 (lol).  That, and it goes well with Aidan (Connor)<br>  <br>  I love using family names.  Both of my boys middle names are family names and any possible future daughter will be named after my grandmother.|`|fZGcufB7aa	I have no idea. Most mom's are just like "Well I don't want my son to be one of 10 Michael's in his class " or "I don't want my daughter to be one of 7 Emily's in her class". Which is really stupid because in my school there is no more than 4 of the kids with the same name. That name is Tanner (for a boy of course). I know it's not really popular now but it was when I was born I guess. I think that most mom's are over reacting about saying that there are going to be 10 other kids with the same name because schools are not huge and in a classroom there are only going to be about 20-27 kids in a class. Not half of the class will have the same name. My name is Ashley, a really popular name, well I have only 1 other Ashley in my grade. I have only known 2 Ashley's in my life. My sister isn't afraid to use popular names because she is naming her triplets Sarah, Taylor, & Emily. I love common names like Madison, Ava, Sophia, & Isabella. And yes when I get older I do except for there to be 1 other Madison in my daughter's class, but that's not that big of a deal. In my class Ashley & I don't have any problem when teacher's are trying to call our name because when they do the teacher looks at the one she is trying to talk to. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps you.

UxG6CkU2aa	As long as she is eating and drinking something, and she is not underweight then she is fine. Alot of kids are very picky. I give my kids carnation instant breakfast mixed in with their milk to supplement them a little if I feel they have not had enough to eat. You could try that, it tastes like chocolate milk, and it is alot cheaper than pediasure.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	or you could try pediasure for her, either instead of the morning milk or the afternoon water, or both.<br>  <br>  talk to her pediatrician for more advice.  i wouldn't really worry about it.  kids go through phases, and before you know it, she'll be eating you out of house & home and then you'll be asking what kind of diet to put her on!

May I remind you that YOU ARE THE PARENT AND SHE IS THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CHILD WHO IS<br>  IN CRISIS.  SHE is not the one who decides that she goes to counciling, YOU ARE.<br>  She has been going through this for six months now, so its not like<br>  its gonna just pass -  you need to take action on her behalf.  <br>  <br>  She needs to understand that it is not a psychiatrist you are taking<br>  her to because you think she is nuts; it is a person who can HELP<br>  HER TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO OBVIOUSLY HAVE MENTAL PROBLEMS; tell her that there are<br>  techniques for dealing with bullies and you want her to learn these<br>  techniques because SHE'S WORTH IT.<br>  <br>  Please, do not allow your daughter to lose anymore of her childhood.<br>  I cannot imagine why this child has been left to be bullied for years<br>  without any intervention.  Of course she doesn't trust anyone and<br>  of course she's stressed out and depressed. Wouldn't you be?<br>  <br>  It's time to start making this child's life your top priority;  if the main<br>  bullying took place at the school, then start THERE.  Go to the<br>  school officials and insist on being referred to someone who can<br>  council her, AND IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD DEMAND THE SCHOOL<br>  HELP YOU FINANCIALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING EVERY CHILD SAFE DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AND THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T DO THAT.<br>  <br>  Its time for a little heart-to-heart chat with a few school officials.<br>  I WOULD HAVE DEMANDED SOME ANSWERS FROM THOSE<br>  JOKERS A LONG TIME AGO.  But don't be mean to them, just be<br>  the loving and concerned mom that you are and be polite but direct<br>  and to the point.  Don't be pushed around, either.  <br>  IF THE SCHOOL DOESN'T HELP, I WOULD CONSIDER GOING<br>  TO A LAWYER AND SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING YOU CAN DO<br>  BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE TO MOVE FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL<br>  OR YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND THE<br>  FINANCIAL BURDEN SHOULD BE ON THAT DAMNED SCHOOL.<br>  <br>  Don't sit around waiting for the one day when your daughter decides<br>  to end her life;  DO SOMETHING.  HASN'T SHE GONE LONG ENOUGH WITHOUT ANYONE CARING ENOUGH TO INTERVENE?<br>  <br>  DO IT TODAY.  I feel so bad for her that I have tears streaming down<br>  my face as I write this.  If this was my child, there would be heads<br>  rolling.|`|jy5mc8nqaa	I think I would sit down and tell her how much I love her.  I would hug her and hold her.  I would let her vent all her anger to me and let her cry and yell and scream.  I would ask what she thinks the right road would be.<br>  <br>  If this is actually about you "The Kid", I'm sorry you are going through all of this.  People can be jerks.  Maybe try to get involved in an extracurricular activity.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	If it were my kid, she would have learned how to defend herself. She wouldn't let it keep happening over and over for the past 7 years. Once she stuck up for herself, and others realized she wasn't going to take it from them, they'd leave her alone. That's how you handle bullies. Bullies are basically cowards who pick on the weak. The key is to toughen up. After 7 years, she should have by now. That's part of the parents job.|`|OYG8vWhSaa	Have you looked into Big Brothers/Big Sisters? It sounds to me like that might help her a lot. Of course you should insist she sees a good counselor, but a Big Sister can work wonders. I had someone like that in my life as a teenage girl and it was awesome.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	That sounds like my husband. I don't know what I would do per se, but I would look into getting her home-schooled, if that's what she wants to do. If she never goes outside, I'd plan a few outing trips with just me and her, nobody else. See about  getting her counseling for social anxiety disorder and for depression, even if she refuses. She's a minor and it would help her, even if she doesn't think it would. Just give her time to remember that she is loved, because she has her family. Support, and time and a lot of effort is what I would do.|`|CmWAzy2Jaa	You are the parent, try to get her to some kind of counseling as soon as you can, any way you can.  You couldn't live with yourself if something terrible happened.  Maybe there is some type of group for adolescents in your area that have gone through this.  Obviously, she is seriously depressed.  Have you talked to your family doctor for support/suggestions? Poor kid, how horrible of those "friends" to do such a thing.  Can you home school her or have her go to an accelerated credit program or night school program?  I wish you and your daughter the very best, take care.|`|crVFU6lBaa	Tell her to buck up her ideas.<br>  <br>  Most kids get bullied.<br>  Most kids fall out with their friends.<br>  Most kids have hormoanes that make them think they're depressed and therefore they think they deserve sympathy, more help, and some of them even think it makes them 'special'.<br>  <br>  Kids these days use all these little problems to try and get people to molly-coddle them. They think theyre so depressed, so hard-done by. They need to grow a back-bone.<br>  <br>  Teenagers can suffer from depression, yes - but the majority of kids think they are depressed (or want other people to think they are) because of their hormoanes.<br>  <br>  Tell the school about the bullies first off, then tell my child to grow a backbone and get in touch with reality. Then, show her some stories or introduce her to a person who is REALLY suffering from depression. If that kid saw someone who really had depression, she would be horrified and feel so guilty for thinking she was suffering from the same thing.<br>  <br>  I reccomend a book called 'Out of the Dark' by Linda Caine and Robert Royston to give to this child. It is a true story about a REAL hard childhood and give her an insight of what REAL depression does to a person. It would make her realise that all these things that she thinks are so hard for her are NOTHING in the real world.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be harsh, but the truth IS harsh.|`|uAIo2A0gaa	I would try to get her to open up and come out. Shes so young to not have a life. Kids now a days are mean the are very nasty little people it will take her time she will make new friends and she will be able to trust again. I had a best friend in high school who broke my trust she stole a few of my boyfriends and spread rumors that werent true. I was very hurt because we were very close. I ended up on depression meds and got new friends. I was 14-15 at the time. I dont know if you want to do that to her and put her on meds but they may help with the depression. I would really encourage her to speak to a counseller someone who is a bit on the young side so she wont feel like shes talking to someone who dosent get it. It may also be one of those things she needs to out grow she is still so young and still in school. I would though if it was me drag her to the counseller my mother did it to me and it helped alot i went through 5 of them untill i found one i liked you may have to do that with her if you are wanting to do so. but i wish you the best of luck and I hope she is doing better.|`|sslXTGY9aa	I would just let her cope with it.<br>  I'm not a parent or anything but, as a teenager, I know things of that sort are definitely hard to deal with.<br>  Whoever the child may be I feel for her.<br>  I'm sure it was difficult getting stabbed in the front and back by the people she trusted most.<br>  It's life though.<br>  I wish her the best though.<br>  The real thing i'd talk to her about is what she really wanted to do next.<br>  Homeschooling is a great option.<br>  Have her do things that she likes to do.<br>  Whether it be go shopping, art, or music.<br>  There has to be something she can or would like.... hopefully she can find something she loves to do and take all of her anger and ddepression and put it towards something great.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would homeschool her.  Seems like the best fit for her:<br>  <br>  -You don't have to socialize (if you choose not to)<br>  -Your schooling is all done in home, so you are not require to go outside<br>  -You won't have to deal with peer pressure, and peers at school|`|X6as2nOAaa	I wouldn't let her refuse to take counseling. I would make her go she is under age and you can. Even if she fights it it usually helps. If she has depression then she needs to be on med's and going to therapy.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	She sounds like she has anxiety, and either depression or manic-depression.  She needs psychiatric help immediately, or she may self-destruct.  My daughter was very ill and out of control when she was a teenager.  I had to make her a ward of the state to get her the help she needed.  She received many years of psychotherapy.  This girl can refuse all she wants, but she's not an adult and can be forced into treatment if necessary.|`|qDBjH4s8aa	She needs professional help. Force her to get counseling. Depression isn't something to be taken lightly.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	i would take her to the doctor and get her psych help<br>  i know shes refusing it but she really needs it<br>  <br>  try home or online schooling|`|AA11940306	If she is unwilling to talk one on one to me or family members, a minister or professional of some sort may give her a way to vent her inner most feelings in order to deal with them in a realistic way...Sometimes doing things against her will is the only way to get thru the barriers,drastic as that may sound its a way to cope with the situations at hand.(referring to counseling)Teenagers often feel the world is going to end at any given moment,they need a way to be shown that isn't going to happen...an outside directive is the only answer when all else fails.
ZvqP3a6Qaa	I didn't have symptoms until after and i actually took my test 4 days prior to when my period was due and i got a positive result so you can actually take one up to 5 days prior to your missed period if you are anxious like i was (first response i used) But i read in my book that it takes couples an average of 6 months to become pregnant so i really wouldn't worry yet. Make sure to have intercourse about 14 days after your period starts thats generally when you ovulate. Good luck!!|`|000cec0ed22ec167c9a8cf98303156dcaa	I've been feeling crappy for about a week and a half now. I was due for a period on the 28th, but haven't gotten it yet. I pray that I don't. I have taken test only to see a negative that almost looks positive. It may be too early to test and if you would like, go have a blood test done. I have been very tired, have cramping and back pain as well as stomach pain, headaches, frequent urination, vision changes, sore boobs and mood swings. But it may be all in my head as your mind can play tricks on you. I have an appointment with my doctor on the 19th due to a cyst that developed on my ovary called the Corpus Luthem Cyst. Look it up and get caught up to speed on that cyst. It is a cyst that developes on the ovary where the egg goes. It's purpose is to make enough progesterone until the placenta is strong enough to build and produce it's own, then the cyst dramatically appears. So, I am anxiously waiting for my appointment. I've wasted money on testing so much and with it being so early and I already had an appointment, I figured I would let him tell me if I am or ain't. I know I waited three weeks to test with my other three pregnancies. Good luck.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I did have frequent urination, cramps, and sore boobs in early pregnancy. But these symptoms can also be associated with PMS before your period starts. I think you should stop stressing over getting pregnant, and quit trying so hard. Usually when couples quit trying and just let things happen, that's when you'll get pregnant. That's what happened for my husband and I. If on the other hand, you are worried you may be infertile, go talk to your doctor.
xwOwsZvEaa	dont mean to sound thick, but how do u know is there a test or something? i would like to find out.|`|KozoNqpsaa	I've never heard of that before...what's your doctor say about it?

sbeoF50gaa	OH I like this question. My daughter has never been to church either. I don't want to brain wash her at a young age into believe what other people tell her to believe. I want her to be old enough to understand what she's being told and old enough to make her own choices in her beliefs. I'm not going to take her to church until she's at least 8 years old. Children believe pretty much whatever adults tell them. I think You're doing what's right :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I believe in God, I do not however, believe in church. To me it's a support group for religion. I have my own personal relationship with God and didn't need a church to get it.|`|Ds2pTMyzaa	At an early age a child is probably not willing to sit still for 15 minutes or longer i mean they have their whole lives and they don't want to waste it sitting around listening to the priest,god would have wanted us to live our lives to the full and enjoy it as much as possible adn not sit their and worchip him all day,we must be thankful for what we have but you can thank god in yur own way by prayig at night .Not going to church doesn't make you a bad person you can go to church if you wish or just pray when you want to,you can believe in god but not go to church for you can pray to him in your own home.In time you will find out wheather you want to go to church or not but you can still believe in god without going.Your daughter will choose weheather she wants to go or not but it doesn't make you a bad person by not takeing her (you can teach her to pray at home instead if you want)<br>  Spaniel luver 7|`|AA11106675	1.  You're not sure?  You can be any religion you want.  Just because you started out Catholic doesn't mean you have to stay that way.  <br>  <br>  2.  Good to know you believe in God.  Are Jesus and the Holy Spirit part of the "stuff" you also believe in?<br>  <br>  3.  No<br>  <br>  4.  Yes<br>  <br>  5.  No<br>  <br>  However, I personally think a religious education should be part of every child's life.  My parents did not attend church (very long story) but I went with neighbors.  It has become a big part of my life.|`|5HWHPPeiaa	i don't think you are a bad person...but it sounds like <br>  God may be dealing with you about this issue....first and foremost is to have a relationship with Jesus Christ...then he through the Holy Spirit will help you to know what you need to do...I personally think you SHOULD be in church because that is where you draw your strength to live for the Lord...it is hard to live for Him on our own...the Bible says that we are NOT to forsake the assembling of ourselves together...that means that we are to congregate regularly with a group of other Christians...you can do that through small groups if you like...check out some local churches and see what works good for you...also the Bible says "you say you believe in God?  The demons also believe in God and tremble."  See, it is not good enough to just believe in Him.  You have to LIVE for him...daily living and worshipping Him...it is our creator, mine and yours and He gave His life so that you can live in Heaven with Him one day...not everyone who believes will get to enter in...please find somewhere to go soon.  It can make all the difference in your life...we're not here for long...make it count...hope this helps you, and God bless you, girl :)|`|LZVZkSHUaa	The purpose for church is Christian fellowship.  If you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ then I would think you would want to share that with your child.  If you are having these questions maybe God is speaking to your heart.  Maybe you should take some time and visit around to some Christian churches and see what you feel is right for you.  It doesn't have to be any certain denomination.  God will lead ou if you let him.|`|jAPBNtMKaa	Yes it is quite possible to believe in God and not go to church. Lots of people do it. Many people believe in God but reject organized religion altogether.|`|qaiYanF2aa	Hi there, I think as a Catholic I have to say you need to get back to some kind of basic religion.  But - what I think is the most worrisome about not attending church with your daughter is that every child needs moral guidance.  If you believe in God and want her to, also, then she needs some kind of formal education in moral beliefs and God.  <br>  <br>  I do think that one of the big things wrong with this country today is that so many, many have fallen into not attending church, not worrying about morals or right and wrong even.  It seems to be all about who can have the most fun, who can make the most money etc.  <br>  <br>  I felt like when the whole Monica thing was going on too many people said to themselves, whew, well if the Pres cheats what can be wrong with My other relationships..outside of my marriage?  So its okay.  Same with these people that scammed the public on the housing mortgages and got all that $ for doing it.  <br>  <br>  A belief in a religion is an important foundation.  Maybe she will quit going in her teens or 20s but she will know right from wrong and have some moral values.. and will come back to it when she is an adult if she does stray away.  You also always have someone to turn to in the hard times even if you are alone.<br>  <br>  I would hope that you would get her baptized also.  Catholics basically believe that if an individual believes in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit they have as good a chance of going to Heaven as a Baptist as they do as a Catholic.  However, if you are Catholic and believe in the Catholic church you should get back to it.  It will help you too!!<br>  <br>  Parents seem so busy now that they don't teach their children -in many cases- good manners and consideration for others, and certainly do not bother with teaching them morals and right from wrong.  I guess they just don't have time?  We have allowed God to be taken out of the schools and at least, kids got a little 'religion' from that but not any more.  Teacher's can't discipline them any more so there is no discipline learned in school.  <br>  <br>  So while I think it is the parent's biggest responsibility to raise a child that is able to go out and support themselves, be able to cope with 'real life' and be happy - how many are really doing their job and preparing their children for 'life' with moral values, rights and wrongs defined, discipline so that they know there are consequences for actions done..  Because when you get out in the real world and are trying to get that education or be promoted in your job but you have no ability to discipline yourself to study instead of party or go to work instead of staying home to baby your hangover..  you don't get far.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it seems like kids are thought of as toys or entertainment or 'as long as they don't bother me' everything is okay..  lol  I don't know but I would surely want to make every effort to teach my child responsibility, moral values and give them a good work ethic to go out in this 'real world'.<br>  <br>  BTW, we raised 5 - 3 girls and 2 boys.  They all are doing fine, which I credit to attending church, believing in God and a strong hand applied to the bottom to teach them about consequences - I guess you can not do that nowadays.  Good luck!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	well, it makes you a bad catholic.  but it doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.  you need to consider what you personally believe the benefits of church would be for your child.  if you don't think they're significant, then i don't see why you should take her to church.  if you think they are, then certainly do.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Nope, you're not a bad person at all. You can believe in whatever God you want and never attend church. There are different levels of religion in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Everyone prays in their own way. Believes in their own way. And as long as you are comfortable with how you do things, then it shouldn't matter.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Not going to church does not make you a bad person.<br>  <br>  You can believe in God and not go to church. (I believe in God, and go to synagogue....)<br>  <br>  You are not a bad person.  You ARE, however, not a particularly good *Catholic* since the church does expect you to go to mass and raise your child in your faith.<br>  <br>  Make your own decisions, and raise  your children however feels right for you.|`|0wTzlG2haa	You are not a bad person simply because you don't go to church.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is possible to believe in god and not go to church.<br>  <br>  Not taking your daughter to church does not make you a bad person.<br>  <br>  Here's my question: do you want your daughter to have a belief in God? If the answer is yes than ask if you are talking to her about god, if you pray with her. Those are the ways that kids learn about about.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Yes there is a God. I'm baptist and I don't always go to church.<br>  It's good if you do, but don't go just because you think you should, go because you want to go and you want your daughter to grow up with that same attitude.<br>  Not going doesn't make you a bad person, but if you feel you need to go then go.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No, going to church does not make you a bad person or is not a bad thing what so ever.  I believe in God, but do not attend Church unless for a funeral or wedding.  <br>  Yes, you can believe in God and not attend a church.  My family is not religious, but more on the spiritual side :)|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I'd say no.  If you don't feel comfortable going to church, or you feel OK believing in your own way without a church, I'd say you're fine.   It's not good or bad to not go though.  It's opinion really.<br>  <br>  I'd say if you believe there's a God you can simply start explaining to her when she gets older.  Or even start with children's Bible stories.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	No you are not a bad person because you don't go to church. Its just something that you might want to work on doing (i doubt you would post this if you didn't care). No one is perfect and God understands that, just try to work on getting your family back in (and it doesn't have to be a catholic church). Im catholic and my bf is Pentecostal but when we go (which is not as often as we should) its to a Baptist church. Because we can relate to the message and the pastor can reach us on a personal level. Its all about finding a place you like and are comfortable with, that's the reason most people fall out of church b/c they can't feel the message or the way its being delivered.<br>  <br>  EDIT: danielle w  i like how you put that "maybe God is speaking to your heart" thumbs up for you : )|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Wow...well if you don't got to Church, you can't really say you are Catholic. <br>  <br>  Does it make you a bad person? No. But being a good or bad person is not what loving God is about.<br>  <br>  Can you believe in God and not go to Church? Sure you can. <br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't talk about good and bad people. There are those who accept God and follow his will and those who don't. Even Satan believes in God, so that is not the point. Our purpose as human beings, is to love God and know our Creator. This is why we follow him, this is why we go to Church, this is why we (as Catholics) keep the sacraments. You should desire nothing less than heaven for your daughter, and to help her in that you should teach her about God, about his love and about his Church.|`|muHctmaGaa	One of my friends studied to become a youth minister, and her favorite quote is something along the lines of, "Sitting in church doesn't make you a Christian any more than sitting in a garage makes you a car." It is possible to have morals without religion, but you already have faith. Especially to young kids church is viewed as this boring weekly chore; I'm not sure that's something you'd want to indirectly encourage. When she's old enough for CCD classes, I recommend enrolling her to learn more about specific Catholic teachings. but I think you're a good parent either way. It's more about your example than anything she learns from coloring in pages of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Speaking personally, though, I was fine when allowed to develop my own understanding of God and Jesus, but pushed away from the church as I became more involved with its doctrine. The Catholic church especially promotes such arbitrary guidelines and as a girl, I don't know if it's best to burden her with that. They suppress information about the apostle Junia, translate as Adam's rib instead of Adam's side to argue for the subordination of women; exluded the Life of Adam and Eve ( a supplement to Genesis with portions from Eve's perspective), the Protovangelion of James (with information about the immaculate conception of Mary, I.C. referring to being born without the stain of original sin, which is why she was called to be the mother of Christ), the Gospel of Mary (about Mary Magdelene, not as Christ's wife as the Da Vinci Code speculated but as a religious scholar and probable apostle), and refuse to ordain women based on unverifiable (and possible contradictory) historical precedents. By writing women out of their history, the Catholic Church tries to keep them out of their present. Honestly, there is more rhetorical evidence that God would be female if God indeed had a gender. I don't believe that Catholic doctrine is appropriate to teach young women, especially in light of the Pope's recent comments about "the destructive blurring of gender." <br>  <br>  I did enjoy reading the Bible as a kid because it was the only book I was allowed during mass. You might want to buy her a children's copy of the New International Version when she's confident reading on her own. Or any children's version of the Lives of the Saints, which should be fascinating.|`|X6as2nOAaa	No you are not a bad person I believe in god and I don't go to church I don't think I should have to go to church to get to heaven god judges you off of if you are a good person or not not if you go to church. My daughter has not gone either, if she wants to then that is just fine with me.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I believe in God and I believe in being a good person and doing good things for other people. I do not have to go to church in order to do that. You can be spiritual without going to church.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	No it doesn't make you a bad person.  You believe in God, but you don't believe in religion.  There are a lot of people that feel the same as you.  Me for one.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	in heaven, there is no religion. talk to her about God, read her children bible stories - it can't hurt. or go to church if it will make you feel better. but God is in your heart, not in a building.

9hkcBmzAaa	hey there, <br>  i too have very heavy periods.  My periods even last 8-9 days.  It sucks really bad.  Is what i do is i wear always and i get the thick ones.  For day time i wear the orange ones because they are longer and for night i wear green.  If she has problems leeking at night tell her to wear really tight strethy shorts so that the pad doesnt move around and it wont get all over her cloths or anything.  I am usually only heavy the first 3 days and then i can switch to yellow whic are smaller.  I know its a pain in the butt to have to wear those but it works|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Putting a thin pad on the thick one makes the blood go only into the thin pad and not have access to the thick one because pads are made with a layer at the bottom which doesn't let blood go on your pants. Didn't you tell her that?<br>  Tips - the girl should go to the doctor.|`|yV8fog7Paa	At that age I had an extremely heavy period which lasted two months, then I went to the doctor. I refused an exam, but I got on birth control. I was on it for around 3 months every day, then after that I made it every two or three days. My mom was angry but I eventually went off of it, without her consent or the doctors consent. I told her after about 4 months of not even taking the pill and she stopped getting them for me. ^^ try that. Tell your mom that, or have your sister tell your mom.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	the thin pad will prevent the flow from reaching the thick pad. she needs to change her pad each hour and if it continues and lasts more than 5 days then she needs to see a doctor to make sure there isn't an issue with a hormonal imbalance....she is probably just fine.|`|e76k5edZaa	no dont take the pill! .. shes to young, and like it can make u put on weight.<br>  i reckon she just stick to pads..<br>  really good ones.|`|49LiABmvaa	my younger sister gets heavy ones too<br>  she wears spandex under everything so it won't go through|`|4IxZwz9Laa	If she was my sister I would probably be looking at taking a visit to the doctors if they are very heavy. I am not sure it is natural to be so heavy when your periods have only recently started so it may be worth getting checked out. Whilst you are there you can get some advice too. I suffer badly with heavy periods and period pains. I have been prescribed with Mefenamic Acid. I take these four times a day a week before I am due to start and I am much lighter and in less pain. If your sister feels uncomfortable going to the doctors, she could always see a female doctor or take you with her. Remember doctors see this kind of thing all the time.<br>  <br>  The best of luck.|`|egbYZOKbaa	all you guys who said just go to the doctor, that would be a waste of the doctors time (asking what pads to use,geez)<br>  use the blue night always pads
wqgkC2MIaa	I tried for two years to get pregnant before I was told I had PCOS, I was told that with out meds I probably would not concive on my own, well two months after finding that out I got pregnant (with out meds) with my oldest daughter (2.5 years old). Then when she was almost one years old, we got pregnant again, all it took was one time with out a condom (I couldnt be on birth control). So it worked out great for me, and for many others. Doctors dont know everything, it seemed the minute I thought I couldnt have kids I got pregnant|`|GWveqx61aa	i have pcos and i got pregnant 2 + years ago without meds, and i think it was all due to what was going on around me, my cat had kittens and i had 10 cats running around the house and a dog, i was relaxed and calm, knowing in every room there was going to be a cat for me to love, i found out i was preg got rid of all but one cat and lost the pregnancy. i suggest for your irregular periods to start tracking your cervical fluid and taking ovulation predictor tests, i hope i helped_good luck and baby dust to all of us_|`|JpIqgtmvaa	Hi. I have PCOS i would like you to check out my website. there is alot of info on there about pcos...please it may help u
s4LWmcTjaa	Child molesters know.  Any person with half a brain and a conscience knows that touching a child sexually or raping a child is legally wrong.<br>  <br>  I believe your feelings are very justified.  As soon as they molest a child, they have given up their rights.  It really it their fault.  No questions about that.  I believe child molestation/rape to be right up there side by side with murder.<br>  <br>  I believe there are too many people trying to make excuses for their actions and try to say that the death penalty is "cruel and unusual".  Well excuse me, but isn't raping a child cruel and unusual as well?  So we are supposed to treat these sick individuals like productive members of society when they rape, kill or molest a child?  I don't think so.  <br>  <br>  And life in prison?  Ok so people want to pay for these molestors to be fed, clothed, have a bed to sleep in and basically pay their way to live?  Some of these sick people don't even care that they have life in prison as long as they can replay those memories in their head.  I say death serves them better.<br>  <br>  Did you hear of the Pennsylvannia man who raped a 5 MONTH old baby?  He is getting one year in prison.  That is beyond screwed up.|`|X6as2nOAaa	They are not harsh enough, I know what you are talking about that they could have learned from this being done to myself but when me and my dad were once talking he told me that if he ever had that kind of thought in his head he would go out back and shoot himself before he hurt someone else. They know that it is wrong and causes issues for the person that you are hurting and if you know you have these thoughts then I would go to therapy or like my dad said shoot myself before I did something I would regret. So to me that is what they need to do and if they don't and they ruin someone else's life then not only do I think they should get to be in prison for life but I believe they should be tortured like their knee cap shot out. That is just how I think.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I believe most child molesters know very well what they are doing is wrong, and i agree that some might have a problem control themselves, but that is what make them dangerous and should be put away from community.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Situations like those make me want death penalties back. I think that most of child molesters do have mental issues.. but I don't find that as an excuse at all. I don't think them getting life in jail is good either. Jail, to me, is a little slap on the wrists! They have a roof over their head, they have clothes on their body, they are provided with meals, and hell some even get educated while in jail! Have you ever heard of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka? Both of them killed and raped women, their own families too! Karla Homolka was released out of prison, and is now roaming the streets. Which, I think is complete BS! Paul Bernardo is life sentenced in jail, but is under protective custody. I think that's COMPLETELY unfair. NEITHER of them deserve to live. Just like any child molester or rapist.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My oldest daughter's biological father raped me. That's how I got pregnant with her. I have no idea if he was molested as a child. As far as I know he wasn't. He grew up in a good home. So who knows what is going through their minds. He went to jail for only 2 years. How is that punishment enough when he did those unspeakable things to me? How is that punishment enough that my daughter is never going to know her father because I want him to have nothing to do with her? I do not believe that they get punished enough for what they do. It may have happened to them when they were little but what right does that give them to turn around and ruin someone else's life? I believe that every person needs to be responsible for the things that they do. They should at least get life in prison because almost every time after they get out, they do it again. So it would save a lot of people heart ache if they would just keep them locked behind metal bars where they belong.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, we hold serial killers accountable and in many cases, that's an irresistable compulsion. You're overthinking this. Our society has decided this is wrong, so people are held accountable, unless they're mentally unable to be held accountable. That's rare, but that guy who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart is an example.<br>  <br>  I don't support the death penalty, but I support lifelong incarceration for ALL sex offenders. Rapists and pedophiles destroy someones life and these criminals should be prevented from reoffending.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is really offensive to me to hear that they know no other way to show affection. It may be based in good psychology, buit it just makes my blood boil. It may be true, but it is not acceptable. I do not feel the need to understand WHY a pedophile molests. Your mom, as a therapist, may have a different mandate.|`|Xya3yzFfaa	I personally think they should get tortured before getting the death penalty! I think killing them is an easy way out for them that is. I know if someone was ever to hurt my daughters in such a way, I would literally make their life miserable in the worst ways possible! I would make them want to end their own lifes from all the crap they would be getting from me! As fars as predators being molested when they were young I think their is a slim number out there, I think alot of non molested molesters use that as an excuse because they think they're going to get away with what they've done.|`|AA11940306	If the penalties were more harsh their impulses to do it may be less acted upon...I agree the penalties should be more harsh...Nothing justifies their actions towards children,their past encounters of the same kind can explain why they think or do what they do but it doesn't justify it...The Penal system needs to address the issues and give them psychological treatments,otherwise they will continue their devious behavior...<br>  Everyone has a right to feel the way they do,as do you...=)|`|gG8oyymiaa	My stepfather was abused, and he did abuse me for 7 years. Does that make him in the right and should not be punished for it. HELL NO! I don't think you have ever gone threw something like that so you couldn't possibley understand. Thats like saying that well if it was done to them and they did it somebody else thats its okay and that they are justified to do it. You have a choice to ether change your life. Or let your past run it for you. I for one think what you are saying is totally wrong. You really need to rethink your facts.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Maybe it is just me but I think they should be put to death immediately, tax dollars shouldn't be spent on scum bags that hurt little kids or kill anyone. But at the end of the day there is no penalty high enough in my opinion because the close family and victim still suffer long after.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	of course it would be a different story if it were my kid, but most pedophiles are ill and statistically were abused themselves. they need help - not the death penalty. - not that they shouldn't be held accountable, but so should everyone who breaks the law or otherwise hurts society.|`|DHwTtPSEaa	I think they just can't get it from those their own age... disgusting wrong and vile freaks!|`|AA11537580	some don't think they are doing anything wrong at all.|`|zQ2m2rkXaa	My husband is in the military & due to his current job has had to deal / interact with some guys that are being charged with child pornography. Although he does not go into detail about who these guys are, he does talk to me about the cases. <br>  <br>  I know that it seems like these guys that have been caught with child pornography, that's what turns them on. They don;t get turned on by long blonde hair, or big boobs, or whatever...... they get turned on by seeing little kids in these situations. <br>  <br>  I think that it would be the same for someone that actually acts upon their desires - a child molester. And I think that in most cases they know exactly what they're doing & that it is wrong! <br>  <br>  I personally think that these molesters should get some of the highest prison terms that are given, including the death penalty or life in prison. These kids & their families are going to have to deal with it for the rest if their lives! What justice is it that these guys only get a slap on the wrist - get out of jail in a couple years, yet the child has to remember it forever?|`|Xg60yW10aa	i agree with you 100%. there needs to be much harsher punishments. i think that it's kind of a persons responsibility to take care of themselves and if they have those terrible compulsions that they know are wrong then they should take initiative and get help for it. it's just like any other addict
KozoNqpsaa	You normally have a pretty short window during ovulation to get pregnant. Sounds like you are doing all the right things, using OPK's, etc. I think you can calm down the BD for this month...or just keep having fun "practicing" if you want. LOL You can test as early as 5 days before with certain HPT's, but since a small percentage of women actually produce enough hormone to show up, I would wait until the day your period is due and test that morning. If you get a BFN, and your AF doesn't start, wait another day or two and test again first thing in the morning.<br>  Good luck!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	The only way to know if you are ovulating would by regularly using an ovulation kit. As for a pregnancy test I would recommend waiting till at least your period is due or even a couple days over. It is possible to get some that will tell 5 days before your period is due but the longer you wait the more accurate test you will get. As for BD even if it is over ovulation time every other day is recommended because sperm can live up to 72 hours and that way DH has time to replenish his supply. Good Luck!|`|E6obQSpraa	You will probably ovulate 12 - 24 hrs after today if the lh surge has just been detected today.  I would carry on BD for the next 3 days personally just to make sure you dont miss your window.<br>  <br>  I would wait until you are late for AF to test to avoid any false readings.<br>  <br>  Good Luck xxx

mCDopsLEaa	If your periods are pretty consistant then i would take one more test this weekend sometime in the morning if you haven't seen AF yet. Then if it is still negative, get a blood test.|`|WWfL5tMvaa	you have many signs of pregnancy. but the negative result is not helping. so wait for a couple of days if you didn't get AF then test again ( remember to collect urine first thing in the morning) and see what happens. some times we let our minds control us and control our bodies and make us feel pregnant just cause we want to be. <br>  so take it easy. be ready for every thing.wish you the best<br>  BABY DUST TO YOU AND TO EVERYONE TTC|`|wOyyZjY0aa	I will share my story.  Three years ago I had very very regular cycles, so when I missed my period I knew I had to be preg.  I tested the day my period was suppose to be there and negative.  I then tested 3 days late, 5 days late and 6 days late.  They were all negatives.  I was taking them right away in the morning, but always getting a negative.  I then woke up and tested at 7 days late (so a whole week late) and got my positive.  So it took my body 7 days to pick up on the preg horm.  We are all very different and that is what my doctor explained to me.  Some women just don't produce the preg horm as fast and as high as others. <br>  So yes, it's possible that even though you got a negative you could be preg.  I would give it a couple of more days.<br>  Best of luck and please let us know.|`|14RzmDTmaa	you could be i would test tomorrow morning and if the test is neg i would go to the doc and get a blood test. good luck.|`|Qk8VQukpaa	yes, it definitely could be a sign!!! wait a couple days and test!!!|`|MAh2yKFnaa	This happens to me too...then I get a period, I hope you get your desired result though!|`|dg83K2Uraa	Okay so I think that is similar to what is going on w/me....<br>  During my last pregnancy I tested negative about twice. I started getting some cramping and my boobs became sore so I thought that I would soon start my period WRONG I was pregnant and it took about a little over a month for my test to be positive. <br>  <br>  Right now I am about 2 weeks late my face is clear as can be and I have been having some cramping, breast are a little sore but not as much as when i am going to get my period. I am confused because I have tested and it is negative. I am currently waiting on a blood test to find out.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend that you just wait it out. If you are not showing you regular symptoms pre period well then be cautious and take care of yourself because you might be pregnant.|`|2V42MnYraa	I would wait until next Monday to test again, and if it is still negative, and AF still hasn't shown up, I would go to the Dr. and get a blood test. Good Luck!

It is your job to show them how to be a good upright man or woman.<br>  <br>  If they Eff up really bad, it isn't always necessarily your fault, they do get a lot of their personality and atitude from their peers (friends).<br>  But you should be there to correct them.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's all about how you act and who they hang with.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	You need to make that a bit more clear. But if i understand the question right. I think that I have heard it like this:<br>  What you did to your parents when you were a kid, that your kids will do it to you 10 times worse.<br>  SO LOOK OUT BABY!|`|OPq2RQeCaa	No, even if they do take after you there's things they'll do that you've never even thought of doing. I take after my mom but there are things I've done in my short time alive that she hasn't even done till this day.|`|6zCalKvKaa	Only if you are a retard. If you are a retard you do stupid things and will probably teach your kids to do stupid things and since you are retarded you will not know why.|`|6nIXYGu6aa	Well it all depends.  If you still do it, then yeah.  If you don't and you completely stopped, they might.  They will probably follow the path if your partner did it too.  But they have a different personality, so remember that|`|vEv2YwWdaa	No.  Everyone is different.  Ask your parents if they said "tru" and spoke like that had the education of a 6 year old.|`|qkXwX897aa	No iv learned from my parents mistakes. So idk some kids are dumb and just follow but most aren't|`|1crjmsTFaa	I wouldn't say that's true, because my dad was a smoker<br>  and I'm not.. each one of us is a unique creature :)|`|ikPeJ0ZXaa	most of the time.

vKEYa8aeaa	yes thats why i wouldnt ever put my child in day care. that happened to my moms friends daughter, who is my age, when we were little.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i get 3 TDs for wanting to protect my baby? WOW. haha|`|sxecXFgraa	If these things only happened at daycares, then yes this would scare me about them.  But since a majority of sexual abuse happens by another family member away from daycares, this does not scare me about daycares.  It does amaze me how shallow some people's thinking is.  You can't look at someone and tell he or she will molest a child and just because a man chooses to be in the daycare business does not make him a molester.|`|AA10186411	What kind of mother would leave their child with a man that looks like that I won't even understand.  I wouldn't leave my daughter with ANY male, especially a 54 year old one.  I mean, what kind of man that age wants to babysit kids?  Thats just weird.  Another reason I don't like home daycares.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Not just limited to daycare...that scares me PERIOD.  Those weirdos are walking around every where out there!|`|ae1c0cee27088bc8de5549468c9d6819aa	Daycare can be a tricky situation. I realize that most parents have to work, but it is so difficult to find a good substitute for an actual family scenario, and most parents are forced to place their children in situations that they cannot comprehend.<br>  I worked (briefly) for a daycare facility. My heart bled for those children. Some were dropped off at 6 in the morning and never picked up until after 7 at night. I loved those kids. I just could not take it anymore. The daycare was much more interested in getting accreditation from the state than they were about the welfare of the children. I worked every day for 5 hours and was required to clean instead of caring for the children. That is wrong. And they actually had people who were full timers who were supposed to be doing these things.<br>  Just so you know, I'm a clean freak anyway so cleaning does not bother me. But, having to neglect 10 or more children to vacuum and clean bathrooms, was not what I envisioned when I agreed to take this job.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	I would never put my children into daycare in this day and age,<br>  Not ever.  YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD TAKE NOTE:  make sure if you plan to marry and have children that you marry a man who is not a loser and who works to care for his family so that you are able to be<br>  at home with the children.  Too many people do not think ahead and<br>  have a family where both parents are working and the children come home from school to an empty home and are being basically raised<br>  by the "kids on the corner".  The children growing up today are in<br>  chas and crisis BECAUSE MOTHER IS NOT AT HOME.<br>  <br>  I'm certainly not rich, but I married a man and did not get pregnant until I knew he would be to support us so that I could be at home to<br>  raise my children.  I cannot imagine having a stranger raise my kids<br>  for me.  NO WAY.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the guy in this situation is in jail so it really makes no difference if you have your kid in daycare near the place.<br>  <br>  Hey, if ya want something to really worry about, please, please go<br>  to this link and tell all your family and friends to visit it as well.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parentalrights.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalrights.org</a>|`|3KoGUAfLaa	HOLY S*** yes it scares me! And I work with children!!! I guess my husband is right (sounds sexist though)...daycare jobs should only be for women. At first I thought he was a sexist bastard, but after looking at this stuff I am terribly horrified. This however, does not mean a woman can't do the same. So in that case, stick with a REPUTABLE daycare (one that does thorough background checks and requires security clearance/fingerprint cards from the Dept of Public Saftey) and you should have no problem. Thank God I don't have little ones to worry about yet. I think I'll just homeschool.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	around 75 % of kids who are abused , the attacker is a family member. So do I worry about daycare? Yes but I worry about that kind of stuff no matter where they are.  I personally prefer day care centres that are well established and have several staff on hand, not a in home day care anyways.|`|GVfHXICWaa	Unfortunately, this can happen anywhere. Not just at daycare. I always worry when I drop my son off at his Fathers house that some creepo will do something to him. (My ex lives with a bunch of guys and there are people constantly in and out of that house) It's scary but I just put my faith in god.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I would never leave my son in a home where that man lives, he LOOKS like a child molester, or a psycho at the least.<br>  <br>  Yes, but these things can happen in school, at sports lessons etc. It's very scary, and that's why parents need to really know their children, and side with their kids first.|`|ajbMVt8maa	yes it does and i think he should be in prison for longer than 18 years!! that little girl will have to deal with this her whole life, so should he.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I've never been a fan of MOST (not all) home daycares...Poor kid(In my area, the horror stories mostly come from the home daycare circuit)|`|X6as2nOAaa	That is sick. For my own issues I wouldn't want a man watching my kids sorry to say but im just not comfortable with that. It also seems weird when they are creepy people. You can kind of tell. I would feel more comfortable taking my kids to a day care that is not inside a home, has camera's, there is a lot more then just one or two people who work there and I talk to some other people that take their kids there. That is just my own opinon though.
GWveqx61aa	fun new exciting tastes,and if she is walking, she may be hungrier due to what shes walking off. my sisters kids are the same way, i think its cuz they see you like it so they want it too_good luck_

nVEBL4ukaa	if there is two lines your pregnant ..... if your not having some sort of hormonal problem. I don't know all the details but two lines is yes one line is no ......|`|KozoNqpsaa	I'm not familiar with that brand...usually it spells it out pretty clearly on the instructions or box. If it's showing positive, then you're pregnant. Just make sure you looked at the test within the time limit as some women get a false positive due to an evaporation line.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	To have a more accurate reading that spells out, pregnant or not pregnant get the new clear blue easy digital or the First response digital. I have never heard of the accu-clear pregnancy test. sometimes when your so desperate to get a BFP you get any home pregnancy test, but not all HPT are alike or accurate and many gives you evap lines giving you a false positive, in most cases this happens especially with women who have PCOS|`|lRr46ABUaa	With both of my children my tests came back negative. Those at home tests arent really as accurate as you think. The best thing to do is go to your local health dept. and they will do a pregnancy test for you. it is based on your income. Or your OB-GYN!!|`|YIb23obFaa	yes
kiAQi91laa	You should eat lean meats, dark green veggies, fresh ripe fruit, and whole grains.  Just to make sure you should consider taking a daily pregnancy vitamin.  I would give in to craving, but keep in mind to limit how much you eat in saturated fats (deep fried foods) and empty calories snacks (brownies/candy).  Drink plenty of fluids such as water and juice, but either restrict yourself from caffeine drinks (coffee/soda) or have a strict limit with them.
kPabzZS1aa	I don't like Answer, I bought those and had multiple positives.  Next month I tried the strips from early-pregancy-tests.com and I didn't have that problem.  I have heard a lot of other people complain about multiple positives with Answer also.  But they are the cheapest, that's why I initially got them.  Good Luck!
d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Well fisrt off the Answer brand is terrible.  I got about 7-10 days of positive tests in a row.  I have heard others complain as well about these.  Concentration of your urine can have a lot to do with it as well.  Some tests are too sensitive and a small amount of the hormone will create a positive.  I would suggest using the Clearblue ovulation kits (digital or not digital).  I used these (the non digital) this cycle and last and they were very accurate because I am also charting my BBT as well.  Throw out those answer tests!|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	my doctor says they are a waste of money ... he says just do it every other day from day 11 to day 20.|`|S1gJJHNzaa	answer brand are the absolute worst tests you can use..<br>  my fertility dr recommends cvs store brand, he said they're the newest best technology but I like these cuz they're the cheapest <a href="http://www.babycreation.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycreation.com</a>
DDFSITiYaa	Sorry to tell you but you cannot expect this kind of change to be met with compliance.  There WILL be crying.  There  WILL be more sleepless nights. But guess what - you will be giving her the gift of leanring to sleep on her own.  I know there are differences of opinions in this matter but I truly believe my kids deserve a rested mommy who can make decisoins and be in control vs a reactive mommy who flies off the handle and is so tired driving is dangerous.  What do you want for your child?  You may have to endure some short term pain of crying or upsetness for long term gain.  <br>  <br>  First you need to wean her or eliminate the night time nursing.  There is no reason other than comfort that she needs to nurse.  Then start by moving her to her own crib/bed beside your bed.  Talk to her and tell her she is to sleep in her own bed now.  She will cry.  Don't gvie in and let her into your bed again.  Keep repeating it to her.  Allow her time to cry and then check on her again.  It will take many nights to get this new habit in place.  Once she will sleep in her own bed, start moving it towards the door, physically.  She will adapt.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	This forum has great advice. Take a look I'm sure you will find really good methods that will help. There is no reason to CIO there are other things that work better.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Good lord, why haven't the two of you found the time and place to be intimate outside of the bedroom?  There's more to this problem than just baby in bed.... <br>  <br>  I've never used it myself, but I've heard good things about the book & methods described in, "The No Cry Sleep Solution" <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=no+cry+sleep+solution&rls=com.microsoft:en-us&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=no+cry+sl...</a><br>  <br>  No person in a family should be co-sleeping if they are not happy with the arrangement or not getting enough sleep that way.  Start gently moving your child to her own bed, respecting her desire to be close & feel secure, by finding alternate solutions that work for her.  Maybe you could sit beside her bed while she falls asleep.  Make sure she's got a full tummy before bed (at 1, she's probably not nursing that often because of hunger - more for comfort & security).   Try creating a soothing 'falling asleep' routine that, at first, includes you, but that adds new elements (soothing music, nightlight, a song she can sing to herself) that she can implement when you remove yourself from the routine or when she wakes in the night on her own.  <br>  <br>  And, in the meantime, you & your husband need to discover the fun you can have on the couch, the spare bedroom, the floor of the baby's room, etc...|`|rlMbcfpXaa	You will need to slowly break her in and lay her in the crib after her evening feeding. She will cry TONS at first, but when she does cry, briefly go in and check on her, pat her, but don't talk to her.  She will get used to sleeping by herself.  There is not a way that I know of that she won't "cry it out." She has gotten used to being with you every night and it will have to be a habit that is "unlearned."|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Please help me, too! I am dealing with the same thing with my 12 month old!  I think maybe letting her cry (and she will because she is used to being with you) is the only way to do it!  I am hoping you get some good advice here that I can use too =)  I am the biggest advocate of a bed being shared by a couple, and being private, so it is very ironic that I have the problem of letting my baby come between that notion...|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	We don't do CIO either.<br>  My second was about like yours, and number 4 here seems to be heading in the same direction. For us, it worked better when dad took over bedtime. He also does nighttime wakings. Whether it is scent, or just 'mami love', my littlest LO is almost 8 months. If he wakes at 4 a.m and my husband goes in, he gives him a bottle and the baby goes back to sleep for an hour or so. But if *I* go in, we are up for the day. We don't do anything different (except for the bottle), but I guess I am just way too exciting LOL. Honestly, we think it is my smell. At this point he sleeps in his crib from when he 'goes to bed' to when he first wakes up- we did this in the first place because when I am next to him he tosses and turns all night trying to get closer and closer to me. Now, when I put him in our bed (which is what he expects of me) he does the same thing. He gets no rest. But he will allow my husband to put him in the crib, and he drifts off to sleep with hubby's hand on his back.  <br>  Nursing babies are very cued in to their mother's scents- try having your husband give it a shot- this is what's worked with three of ours. (the other two there was never any issue at all.)|`|kvAeV9GYaa	Honey you did this to yourself.  I know when you have a baby you just always want to be with it and to sleep with it.  But now that has caused a problem.  I know it may be rough to do this but you just have to put her in her crib and let her cry, she has to get use to it, I can't think of no otherway.|`|17b2a242cee18b1114c5a4c68c54a689aa	The best thing would be 'cry it out'. I know you dont want to hear that or do that and neither did I but it worked. Its going to break your heart and your going to want to go get her but...leave her be. She is old enough. Also, breastfeeding is your choice but my dr just had me switch my child to whole milk.|`|PgBiP4enaa	you can try wraping her tightly or there is this one bear you can get @ target and it makes them feel as if they were in there mothers womb or try toys that light up or crib viberations that should help them not cry
KaNjj6HBaa	Yes you can use an ovulation kit. The Clear blue fertility monitor will county to 99. So as long as you have a period every 99 days you can use it! Good luck! If you are having a 45 day cycle then it is highly unlikely that you ovulated on day 7. It is possible but not very likely. Good luck and all the baby dust you want!|`|AA10371609	I had wonderful results using an ovulation kit.  You usually ovulate in the middle of your cycle, but finding that day can be tricky.  Everyone is different, and I'd rather spend the $20 on a kit than thousands of hours on heartache.|`|h46SsYoBaa	You normally ovulate right in the middle of your cycle, so for you day 22 or so. It could be earlier or later. You will know that you're ovulating by consistencyl mucus amount and consistancy. plenty of stretchy egg-whitey stuff is perfect baby-making conditions :)
fMilDRgLaa	Hmmmm may be implantation bleeding.  I had that with both of my sons.  It was about 10 days past ovulation and I remember the first time it happened.... I was bleeding lightly pink, brown, and red.  I was so upset because I really thought it was our month. I remember crying and praying to God that I would be a mommy soon.  Guess what after about 2 days of this....it just stopped.  I was pregnant and confirmed it with a pregnancy test a few days later when I realized I didn't have a weird period.  <br>  <br>  The second time around, I knew immediately in the first 12 hours I was having implantation bleeding.  Fingers crossed for you.|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Go and take a Home preg. test, if it is false, wait for AF to arrive, she just may be late due to stress or other activities in your life<br>  Good luck!|`|YIb23obFaa	i am sensing implantation bleeding??!! lol was it lighter than red? like pinkish, i dont think that matters but implantation is when it plants itself into the whatever ive had this told to me so many times lol you probably know and involves cramping and a little spotting so it is very possible you could be pregnant! good luck wait to see if your period starts its only a couple days if it doesn't then take a test! GOOD LUCK
64OsCr8laa	it means spanking leaves alot of lose ends. at times the child will not know why he is being spanked i can remember that unless you expain it to the child like your getting a spanking because you ran into the street, it leaves a question of why did mommy just get on to me kind of thing <br>  <br>  so if you spank be sure your calm and be sure the child knows what he did wrong|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Spanking like most punishments don't teach a thing. The child has to be taught that what they did was not acceptable. Then held accountable for there actions. If you have calmed down enough to teach first you can usually come up with a more effective means to punish.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Maybe it causes other problems with it so it ends up being a big huge mess.|`|40e721c1bfd11b9a991085e4902841e7aa	I have a friend who went to spank her daughter when she was in 7th grade and her kid put her hand up and said "if you spank me...I call Children services". I could only think that maybe this is what they are talking about.|`|IWzYB44raa	Because they don't want to listen to their kids cry, and because they don't want to put forth the effort to spank them. That's what I think they meant.
f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I would think its normal, some kids run very small and some kids run bigger. When my cousin was 30 months she weighed 23 pounds. Her brother was 35 pounds. Every kid is different.|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	I think you really should have a medical evaluation for your child.  She may have some gastrointestinal or other health problems. She should be eating plenty not just drinking, and she could be malnourished from lack of food.|`|KmC0K59taa	No, I'm afraid this is not normal.  My daughter is 22 mos and very small for her age.  She weighs 24 lbs.  <br>  <br>  Make a doctor appt and have her checked out.  Try feeding her new things.  Have you tried scrambled eggs for breakfast and grilled cheese for lunch?  Mine loves yogurt and string cheese and those are fatty.  Give her whole milk to drink also.

You let your almost 3 year old control you in this way? that's uncalled for. Not sleeping through the night? She does think she is the only one on the planet. I trained my 3 month old baby to sleep through the night. She definitely is pulling your leg. If you cannot make her eat normal foods then go to the doctor. She definitely is underweight. Why a child is to be 1 year and 20 lbs to turn their carseats around!|`|jCB7S6sfaa	i do think thats normal.My son is almost 2 and weighs 40 pounds and the doctor said he is way above average.i wouldnt be concerned just ask your doctor next time.
yKS2UI87aa	Respect her feelings for now. She is sad and while I'm sure she wishes you no harm she is jealous (not in a bad way) just b/c you still have your baby. Talk to the friend and hopefully with time and enough shoulders to cry on she will come around. Try and be as supportive as she needs you to be.|`|p3GZERIsaa	You're just  a troll.

AA11327039	Go to a local bakery and share a cupcake.  Go go a local produce stand (that this time of year probably sells imported stuff) and buy fresh fruits and vegetables.  Visit a local antique shop and buy a few old toys. (Toys in an antique shop are generally $5-$10 or cheaper)  Go to the mall and get the baby's portrait taken wearing dad's shirt and tie, bring along some of his dress shoes and a copy of the business section of the local paper. (Think Fathers Day)|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Next time you are out, go to a craft store and get some finger paints and paper.  Kids love to do this.   Maybe you can get her to help "dust the furniture".  Or make the beds.  I used to have the recipe to make home made clay or dough, but you can find that one  one the internet to start making different shapes and things of that nature.  Coloring books work well also.  Tea party if you can get a small tea set, invite her stuffed animals as guests.  If you have a card table, throw a sheet over it and play house.  Exercise to a TV exercise program or get a work out DVD and to that together.  When she gets a little older, the library is fun too.  Good Luck and hope this helps.
URbMCRFLaa	My best friend did the same thing and yes it is wrong. She was not high when she was in labor or at the hospital so she was not acting funny or abnormal. People need to remember it's just pot! Yes she shouldn't do that to the baby but it is not a whole lot different than cigarettes from the toxins going to the baby. Cigarettes are bad for the baby but what I'm saying is pot is one of the least harmful street drugs. The thc will probably have some affect on the child but I've seen many and I mean MANY "pot" babies and I have not seen any mental problems or handicapps by that alone. But my guess is the child probably won't have the same intellectual capabilities that he/she COULD have had. (If the baby was a stoner while forming and developing it's brain and whatnot- it would probably hinder it). But like I said, of the many that I know- they do well in school and are not around it anymore. Also, pot does not give withdrawal symptoms like other drugs, so NO there won't be withdrawal symptoms. Unless she gets pot that is laced with something- unless you grow it, you never know what is has come across or been mixed with since it is sold by weight usually- be cautious. She might have a fat baby if she got the munchies alot but I know some people that had to smoke it to force themselves to be hungry and eat so their kid could grow! My advice- be careful what she smokes it out of. Obviously any paper product will be more ingredients that she is inhaling and aluminum pieces are bad too. Glass is best from what I've heard. Also, remind her that when she's high so is her baby and since the baby doesn't know what's going on and why it feels like that all of a sudden, it might not "enjoy" it like she does. Tell her good luck with the rest of her pregnancy and labor! She really should get more support from family and friends if she can't or doesn't want professional help. If she plans on nursing, it would do the same to the baby that it did in the womb, fyi. If she can't quit, she really should use formula for the babies sake.|`|AA10186411	Trust me, they will be able to tell that she was on drugs.  The baby will be born addicted, and will go through withdrawals after birth.  I hope CPS takes that child away from her!|`|8IfePMa3aa	It depends on where you live. Most places only test if there's a reason to suspect something, others test everyone.<br>  I've seen this type of question many times...I'm definitely going to recommend testing all infants at the hospital I work with...hopefully every place will test every baby since it's apparently needed.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Yes, hospital babies are tested for drugs as well as other problems shortly after birth.  Your biggest hope should be that they test the baby.  That way someone more responsible can give him/her a good healthy life.|`|A8k9NHigaa	she is s freaking idiot and doesn't deserve that baby, yes it will be tested, and if comes up positive Child Services will not let her take it home as well they shouldn't.|`|7IHMjy2caa	Depending on where you are. They will test mom and if comes back positive of course they will test the baby. <br>  <br>  CPS will be called if any drugs are found in mom or babies system|`|90zcKChJaa	The doctors will not give the baby a drug test. She needs to get some help to quit though.|`|KaNjj6HBaa	Well your friend first of all is selfish. I have no pitty or mercy for someone who abuse and innocent child who did not ask for what she is doing to her baby. It is not just your friend that is being affected it is this child that she has chose to bring in the world and then she chose to hurt it the entire time it is in the womb. Is this your friends first child? If it is the first child then she will probably be in the hospital longer than she would if it was a second or third child. Which means that the doctors and nurses will witness this poor child going through withdrawals. So then will they be suspicious! And then they will start asking the mother questions.|`|oiJITSNZaa	The doctors can tell don't you worry if it is a druggie baby. I had several babies come into my care that the mom was a daily alcohol abuser. The babies had withdrawal for months. For alcohol within minutes of entering the mom's systems the fetus's level is the same as the babies. You are not helping her at all by staying quiet. But then when the baby is born with brain damage no body will even have to test to know mom was on drugs.|`|YIb23obFaa	dont listen to any of those idiots you know how many of my friends smoke pot and how many of them got pregnant and every single one of them had healthy big beautiful babies while they smoked when they were pregnant. they will when shes going into labor they told my sister she needs to cut down lol so she should stop this late in pregnancy though thats the dangerous part. she could have complications with birth so tell her to stop until the baby is born and if there is lots of drugs or whatever in the babys systems they could have it taken away tell her that part i bet she will stop lol.|`|U2KUjFoSaa	girl if you are in miami, fl, every baby that is born and mom have blood tooken out for multiple test before they release you, so most likely they will take the baby..<br>  <br>  tip> BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO HAVE A CHILD FIX UR LIFE OR ATLEAST BE WOMEN ENOUGH TO GIVE UP FOR ATLEAST FUXIN 9 MONTHS...|`|TIUOZ1Vdaa	That is terrible! That baby is NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES okay. You need to get her help right away! She could lose the baby that way. Please, just get her help!

Right?|`|D5cOFZdwaa	They test all babies.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	they don't drug test baby's in scotland|`|nVEBL4ukaa	unless you cousin dr reports her to the hospital there should be no reason to test the baby unless the baby is born with some type of drug related side affects but pot doesn't normally do that.  i think she will be fine ...... but for the health of the child's lungs i would stop now and if you need to start again later.
HCmAoNjzaa	Are you talking about your progesterone results? <br>  <br>  If so then a 4 & a 5.8 result shows that you are not ovulating. Your doctor needs to increase your dosage. My first month on Clomid 50 mg my progesterone was only 4 then she increased my dosage to 100 mg and it went up to 10. I would insist on having my Clomid increased.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that a level over 5 probably indicates some form of ovulation (maybe an immature egg), but most doctors want to see a level over 10 on a natural cycle, and a level over 15 on a medicated cycle.<br>  <br>  My doctor has now increased my Clomid dosage to 150 mg because last month my progesterone was only 13 on 100 mg. They want to see at least a 15 on a medicated cycle.|`|2f6diQBiaa	That is a really low number and does not indicate a strong ovulation. It's possible, but not probable that you can sustain a pregnancy at those levels. Your doctor will likely have to increase your dose to 150mg.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and lots of baby dust!!!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	yes that can happen, my son is just getting over one that appeared out of nowhere.  actually i went online a found something interesting, yogurt i guess is capable of getting rid of yeast.  as is coconut oil.  really strange but it definitely works, we're on day 3 of the infection and it's mostly gone.  using yogurt.  i guess the bacteria they use as cultures actually kill the yeast.  as for the neglecting thing, i definitely agree with you.  it does sound like he did.  mine only had a mild case, to get something that bad that hurt in a day...she would have had to have been sitting in it for a very long time and multiple times if he changed her at all.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I have a child prone to yeast diaper rashes and I have seen a bum go from perfectly clear to having a few bleeding spots in between two diapers changes only two hours apart.  I have seen a rash so painful it makes the child scream spring up during ONE nap. <br>  <br>  Also I don't think that a full day visit is necessarily in the best interest of the father-daughter relationship at this age.<br>  <br>  I have no idea whether its unreasonable that he doesn't know her feeding schedule, etc.  It depends on whether he's part of her day to day life.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Yes! That is crazy your poor daughter! I hope she is doing better<br>  <br>  I say you should work out something with him stating that if she goes over there you are to be there with her the whole time or he can wait till she is potty trained to ever have her again!<br>  <br>  I don't see why guys make such a big deal out of changing a diaper 90% of the time it's just pee ohhh so scary!<br>  <br>  I'd also be worried about her wellbeing, does he just leave her there to cry? Is he actually feeding her? and would he ever go to the point to shake her. I'd be going nuts I live with my bf and the only time he gets to watch her when I'm gone is during her naps because I know I can make it to my errands and back before she wakes up (he is totally usless!)|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Yes, I would suspect him immediately. If yeast infections happen because of her sitting in a moist diaper for hours, and you never let that happen then I'd be 100 percent sure he just let her stew in her own diaper mess for hours. I hope this mistake will show him that neglecting diaper changes is a big deal!|`|qjDxKXENaa	i would try and keep her off him untill he learns how to look after. ask him to go to parental classes to get experience. you have the right to stop this.otherwise your child will get very ill and nobody will care for that when its too late. it will only hurt you.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	it is pathetic but i doubt hes fully doing it on purpose. some 'boys' are just dumb about things like that and they do need someone to tell them what to do.

Tell him when she gets older, he can always play with her toys.  Tell him barbies suck though and not to ever touch one.  Tell him his mommy is going to be alright.  Tell him he will probably be hearing screaming and crying from the babby when it comes home.  Tell him life's a bltch and he will soon see that.. lol.|`|5DpDAH6Saa	Just try to answer any questions he may have. Try to get in contact with Mom so she can talk to him. If you can, try to explain that he'll be the big brother, so he'll get to help out with his new sister.|`|kY8JTDD6aa	Just tell him his mom is going to the hospital or birthing center or wherever to get him a new baby.

I'm going to break rules & answer seriously here...<br>  <br>  age 4 is tough - the world revolves around them...  <br>  <br>  best advice: ask leading, open ended questions first to break the ice:<br>  <br>  1. Are you excited about being a big brother?<br>  <br>  2. What will be best about having a little sister?<br>  <br>  those type of questions that allow him to offer up his feelings...<br>  <br>  Then you can say "I have some really happy news for you - Mommy is having the baby tonight, and you will get to meet her tomorrow"<br>  <br>  Then ask if he has any questions he'd like to ask... and just listen.<br>  <br>  give him a little extra attention... and lots of love ( which I am sure you are great at )<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cmw591woaa	i like the cards and ice cream ideas. then you can ask him if he has any questions about anything, and hopefully he will say 'yes. can we watch barney?' and you're off the hook.|`|bYWTE40Vaa	Your mommy wasnt just getting really fat, she got knocked up! <br>  <br>  PS. you spelled babby wrong|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Tell him his mommy is in pain because she is having a baby, she will be okay and when she comes back you will have a new baby sister!<br>  <br>  i dont know thats a hard situation, try to keep him off subject, play games with him and distract him from asking questions.|`|Xc02z608aa	Is there a way that you can get the mom on the phone.  If you can get her on the phone it might do him a lot of good to hear from her that she is fine and that when she comes home she's bringing his new baby sister.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Just tell him she looked freaked out because she's excited, and that she is perfectly fine. If you want to keep him busy, have him make a card or something to give to his mom and the baby when he sees them.|`|f6aqMg97aa	Tell him that he is going to be a big brother.  Make it sound all exciting...<br>  <br>  You might pick him up a bear and a dr's kit, and you can play dr tonight, that is what I did w/ my kids.  It worked out great.<br>  <br>  You could also get him a Big Brother Tshirt that he can sport around.<br>  <br>  Explain to him the responsibilities and how iportant the bihg brother role is.  If Mom is doing ok in the hospital perhaps she could give him a call or if she is not very far in labor you could take the boy to the hospital to deliver flowers, but do not stay long....  Call the hosp ahead of time to see if they will let him see her....<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK
BBfIXcI0aa	Well, I would be a bit miffed that she hadn't informed me she was sexually active so we could take preventative measures.<br>  I'd schedule a prenatal appointment, and we would get in touch with adoption agencies so we could start exploring options - I'm not taking care of her baby for her, and she's not able to do so. I don't believe in abortion, and anyone in my household who gets pregnant is going to have to deal with that, but there are lots of resources out there that help teens' lives not get ruined by pregnancy by placing the child with people who are ready for it. h|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I had to tell my mom when I was 14... I just turned 15. :)<br>  My mom just was like, crying. And she was saying how she had me and my twin sister as a teen, older than me, and it was still the hardest thing she ever had to do. She never yelled, and was really supportive. My step-dad... He's still pissed. L0l. <br>  I'm having a baby girl, and if she tells me she's pregnant at 15, I would support her every step of the way, knowing how hard it really is. But, that would never happen. My daughter won't be having sex, let alone a child, until she's like, 20. Aha.. :)|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I got pregnant at 16 and my mom was very supportive. I had a boy! I'm expecting my 2nd in March and Its a girl! If she was to tell me she was pregnant I think I would support her all the way at least until she's able to find a job. Other than that she would just have to take care of the baby ant nights or when no tin school. This is what my mom did with me. Financially she helped but not by taking care of him at night or whenever I wanted to go out.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I would start crying. I'm not a mom and won't be for a long time but I would start crying hysterically. And I'd ask her why she would do something like that. I probably wouldn't talk to her much for a couple days but in the end I would support her.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	If my daughter was pregnant at 15, I would make her put her baby up for adoption. It would be the hardest thing in the world for her, and I, and the whole family, but in the long run, it would be better that the baby went to live with parents who are already grown, have careers, and are able to fully provide for the baby.  I know it seems harsh, but I am against abortions, and I am also against 14, 15, 16, 17, and sometimes even 18 year old raising babies!  They need to grow up first before being responsible for another human being!    I would do it because I think it would be best for my daughter, and her baby.|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	Well, if I were a parent I would have talked to her a long time ago and given her all the resources and information I had so this wouldn't have happened in the first place. <br>  <br>  But if it DID happen, I would tell her that I would help her and support her no matter what because she is my daughter and I love her.|`|FEXnrx1taa	you should tell her now<br>  <br>  18 minutes of pleasure if 18 years of responsibility.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	i've had that talk with my mom after my cousin got pregnant at 19. she said of i got pregnant she would take me to get an abortion and i completely agree with that.|`|agGG5LX8aa	Well, I would offer her the option that would make her life easier. I would adopt her baby for my daughter's sake and I would probably home school her for a while so she wouldn't have to go through high school being know as "the girl who got knocked up at 15"
AA12220250	He's trying to prove he can drive and listen to loud music and can play with driver side windows. I would just ignore him and dont look at him.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	He's trying to impress.  That's really not to hard to figure out is it?|`|8Raw4M1naa	Sounds like hes trying to impress you, but is... slightly clumsy about it. He turns up the radio so you look at what is making the sound and see him. He probably has a bit of a crush on you, but like most men around his age, is probably still a little nervous talking to girls.<br>  <br>  If he keeps on harrassing you after you've told him to stop, talk to your parents and let them know hes following you around and bothering you.
Ccq8zEcnaa	If the tech was 99% positive the baby was a girl, and your doctor feels the same.. I don't think you should be worried. Nowadays the technology is getting better and better and so are the people that operate the machines. I think you should wait until the next ultrasound and be patient. Or save your money to get the $99 3D version.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I would take her word.  The tech has knowledge of how to tell what it is. Mine told me this about a girl,I didn't get another ultrasound,it was a girl. Then she told me it was a boy,and it was a boy. (different pregnancy) If they both think it's right,then chances are it's right. It shouldn't matter,as long as it's healthy. You're making a big deal out of this,and it's not a big deal. Stop reading online stuff and getting paranoid.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	his tattoo has been scheduled. and he is probably excited. you guys already know its a girl. stop reading stuff online and chill.<br>  <br>  why would it matter if it's a girl or boy anyway??? it's still your child|`|xMy0QEvFaa	You need to sit down and have a long talk with him, he needs to put his baby girl first in everything now.

I'm having a girl to but I've also had to boys there is a very distictive difference between the pics. If there was a chance of it being a boy they would have told you. I've known a lot of people to have to get a second u/s because they couldnt see the "parts" yet, but if they said girl then its a girl. Congrats!|`|t5QTOBqzaa	I dont see why not, it's your first child so its extra special, and the pictures would be coool.<br>  And $99 isn't that much, for a picture of your first baby i think it's cute, i dont see why you shouldnt it wouldnt hurt. :]<br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way. :]<br>  & good luck. x|`|Px3bsqPraa	why not just wait for ur next scheduled ultrasound? youll be able to see more later anyways... and actually 3D ultrasounds can hurt the baby. the soundwaves and radiology can effect them... if u care read up on it before u get it|`|9Eebavmiaa	I would trust the dr. If she told you that, she's gotta be sure. Mine said the same thing...and sure enough at 28 weeks had the 3/d and she was right!|`|oHsxp5weaa	You are totally over reacting. Chill out ans long as your baby is healthy that's all that should matter.|`|THF5Da8Waa	I know that your first baby is really close to your heart, especially when you don't know the sex. However, I think you should consider than an ultrasound tech does those things day in and day out... I've had four kids and they were all done at 17 weeks with a correct sex. I don't think picking a fight with your honey is going to make the situation any better tho- remember that guys are kind of emotionally retarded; He probably wont get to experience the excitement that you SEE (your belly) and feel every day until that baby comes!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I don't think you should worry about the gender but even getting a 3d/4d ultrasound is not a waste of money I don't think. I have wayy too many friends that have gotten them and said they don't regret it one bit. They loved being able to see the baby's face and everything. BUT because you are only 20 weeks I wouldn't get one yet. Most places tell you the best time to get it done is 25-30 weeks. So you could be wasting your money just to find out the gender. Look around and see if you can find somewhere that does normal 2d ultrasounds pretty cheap. I was impatient and wanted to know the sex before my 20 week appointment that I got one done at a place that does 3d/4d ultrasounds for only $50 which to me was well worth it! They gave me the pics of course, journals, cds, dvds, and tons of information.

It is there to prevent malnutrition by making sure that at risk kids (and pregnant and nursing women) get some foods in addition to their normal diet to try to eliminate a few common deficiencies.<br>  <br>  Also formula should be made with distilled water, not nursery water and not in most places tap water to prevent fluoridosis.

But fluoride intake above optimal amounts can create a risk for enamel fluorosis in teeth during their development before eruption through the gums.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  If liquid concentrate or powdered infant formula is the primary source of nutrition, it can be mixed with water that is fluoride free or contains low levels of fluoride to reduce the risk of fluorosis.

(The infants in this study were aged four to six months.) Mothers may exhaust their supply of WIC-provided formula before the end of the month, and some may resort to giving their infants other liquids. The authors acknowledge that the WIC program is intended to be supplemental, but some mothers may presume that the program supplies everything the infant needs, "and are reluctant or unable to use their food stamps or cash to buy infant formula." A disappearance of alternate (non-WIC) sources of free infant formula and a sharp increase in the retail price compounds the problem.|`|r7tWe5dqaa	Because wic has broader allowances for income and provide only certain foods for mothers and children so that they can be sure you are both healthy. Wic is not a government program and their rules are much different than the rules for food stamps.<br>  <br>  If you are a bottle feeding mother with NO money and have NO other children and you have a ONE month old baby keeping you from returning to work and you don't qualify for disability because you did not have any earnings during that quarter of the previous year.... How are you supposed to care for your child without eating? You cannot function or properly care for a child if you are not sufficiently healthy for the task.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I don't know. Why do people too poor to buy formula not breast feed? Sorry, but it is directly related to your question so why not ask?|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I agree with Asher. The people I know who have received formula from WIC and food stamps chose to use formula with flimsy-sounding excuses (mastitis, thought it would be easier to bottle feed with two children...) <br>  <br>  Also, when I went to county fair in Ohio last summer, the WIC booth had a large poster encouraging breastfeeding. It would save the agencies money.<br>  <br>  However, if you are worried about double dipping, then only receive assistance from one source. Or none. When my husband was finishing his master's of divinity degree, we could have qualified for food stamps and/or WIC, but we didn't need it.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I am guesing cause maybe the formula they provide isnt enough to last the whole month...|`|52bAHCaUaa	My daughter receives formula from WIC, however its not enough to last a whole month. I still have to buy at least 2 cans, if not 3. Its not designed to supply all the babies needs, as its not designed to supply all the mothers needs, whether they are breastfeeding or 6 months pp. <br>  <br>  We do not qualify for food stamps. So I don't know anything about that myself. But I do know food stamps is supposed to be for the entire family, where WIC is just for the mother and child.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~<br>  Asher - The amount you can make to qualify for WIC is quite high, much higher than what it is for food stamps. Formula is very expensive, its nice to have some help. I wish I could have breastfed, however my daughter was a preemie, and only weighed 2lbs when she was born. Some women can't breastfeed. Not all formula moms choose not to.|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	fort one, WIC only gives 9 cans of formula, and most babies eat 15 cans the first 4-6 months.  In addition, you say not to talk about breastfeeding, but if the mom is breastfeeding, shre will need food and WIC doesn't provide a breastfeeding woman near enough food.<br>  For 3, the point of foodstamps is not just for the child, whereas WIC is.  WIC is only a little bit of food and is only for the child, unless the mom is pregnant or breastfeeding, which is still essentially for the child.  Foodstamps is for the whole family.  Also, WIC is only for children under 5 years old; so do you think children over 5 years old should starve because it would be double dipping?  <br>  So the reason you can get both foodstamps and WIC is because WIC doesn't provide enough on its own and it doesn't provide for the whole family.  Foodstamps will cover the mom, dad, and older children which WIC does not and anything extra children on WIC still need.  Foodstamps on their own are often not enough as well , so both are needed.|`|gqlC8cbpaa	Well, Mr. #$#@#, I don't see why you are so worried about it!!!!!!!  But if you got to know, I have 3 kids and had to participate in Wic but did not qualify for food stamps because of income in home and you only get 9 cans of formula/month and at end of month I always had to buy 2 or 3 maybe which were like $13.00 a peice and some people are not as well off as others and that is alot of money especially with one income that is pretty decent but a family of 5 with a disabled mother that cannot work and needs neck and back surgery due to 2 car accidents and an injury at WORK.  I can't get over why you are worried about it, or why you ever bothered to "attempt" to answer my question about my seat in my truck!!!  Read the other answers, most posted by your  contacts!  That is exactly why I tried to "dictate" what I got for an answer b/c somebody on here always thinks they know somebody or something.  But as for this question, if a mother is getting food stamps b/c the income in house is THAT LOW, do you really care that the recovering woman who just gave birth gets a few extra stamps when there are ppl out there that spend there life living off the state and work on side or lie about people living in home with income, or even worse sell drugs and/or sell food stamps for drugs or money to get them to selll.  Worry about the real problems with this system.  Like the people that are frauding the system and what not.  Not a new mother who needs nutrician to gain her strength back so she can go back to work and/or take care of her baby and her body.
yGabEjDMaa	1st - my son was born over 8 years ago - sorry, can't answer that, but time does fly!<br>  <br>  2nd - my sister-in-law got pregnant with her tubes tied, however her husband was not "fixed"<br>  I doubt they mixed up the tests, but it could be a false positive.  Her HCG levels could be really high for what ever reason (stress can actually do that) and give a false positive.  As for her getting herself into a bad, bad situation, if she really is pregnant, then one of two things will happen here.... one, hubby is gonna be really, really mad.  or two, they are going to be really, really rich!|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	i have heard of women getting pregnant after having their tubes tied, and men still getting their partners pregnant after the procedure aswell but together would be tough!!  let us know how she went on im intregued!!<br>  <br>  i didnt have my son in december, it was sept 06 and it stil fells like yesterday, but he will be 3 this year!! hes still my baby :)|`|JreuGwJYaa	those procedures sometimes do not work all the way there could have been just that one time, I'm not sure I'm not a doctor so she'll just have to wait for her test,|`|qayCggxMaa	1) No december baby here.<br>  2) A sample mix up is possible or other error at the lab.  The other thing is, certain kinds of tumors can excrete hCG, which is the hormone urine pregnancy tests test for.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	1st. I haven't had mine but im a december baby so yahhhhh!!! lol<br>  2nd. i doubt they mixed up her urine (although it maybe a mistake). Nothing can stop pregnancy 100% except abstinence. I know girls who have gotten their tubes tied and still got pregnant. It must be God's will, at least you know this baby was meant to be : )
GWveqx61aa	sorry i dont have a baby, but that is amazing, congrats, and for your aunt, possible to mix it up, but unlikely, another posibility but also unlikely is a false positive, the dr office does a urine test have her take an at home, dollar store sells them.., and sometimes tubals fail and vasectomys fail too sometimes, . another reason testing positive could be certain meds, but those are meds that are injectable hormones, or i read that cysts could cause a false pos.not a bad situation, many woman like myself consider this a blessing,i but it sounds like this may be one of those cases that this is not a blessing, so for that reasson i wish that things go your aunts way, id like to know the results of the test_good luck_|`|PDmoIvRwaa	That is pretty crazy!  I have heard of similar things happening, though very rare.  This would seem to be an act of God if this pregnancy turns out to be viable.  I recall reading something about hormonal changes or imbalances can sometimes provide a false positive. Good luck to them both!|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	Sorry, I don't have a baby yet...but I'm sure I will feel that way in a year when my son nears his first birthday!<br>  <br>  Yes they could have mixed up her urine, but it is quite rare for them to do that because they want to take all precautions to make sure things like that don't happen!  Neither the tubes being tied or the vasectomy are 100% in preventing pregnancy.  Both are under 100% at the best of times and can also reverse themselves.  The human body truly is an amazing thing.  Of course it is always possible that her tubes being tied could have failed and she had an affair with a man who was not fixed; but no one would know that for sure right now except her.  But it is very possible for her and her husband to have conceived.  I've never heard of any hormonal problem that would lead to hcg in her body but I suppose that could always be a possibility...I have heard of things crazier!  <br>  It really isn't up to you to say it is a bad situation though...who knows, it could be a blessing in disguise! :)

Only money/goods from the father counts.|`|TQW5E6olaa	He's the one obligated to pay child support so unless he's buying them, no, you don't NEED to report the things Grandma buys|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	say thank you and be grateful that she is offering to help.  not many would..|`|YW74O9aNaa	Well... depends really bad you need the child support. If you are not working and really need it then accept it and report it as child support. This will also help you and ur ex remember how much she did and later whenever you can, pay it back to her.  <br>  But since she's not the one responsible for it, you can choose not to report it. <br>  <br>  If you can live without the support then just thank her and refuse the help. Wait for a few months till the father is back on job.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no i would say thanks but ill wait til he gets a job and pays himself. its not her responsibility so i guess it couldnt be classed as child support. but to be on the safe side id refuse it, it may be backdated when he gets a new job the weeks he missed on.|`|TlXLKVEOaa	No as long as you give the dad a break . If he has it rough right now the be nice and give him a break to get on his feet again remember she doesn't have to help out in the first place.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Child support is not her legal responsibility, so I would consider anything extra that she provides to be a gift.

ONLY those things rec'vd from HIM.  She is just being a helpful, concerned, supportive mother in law and possibly friend of sorts - you need not feel guilty about NOT reporting what she does or gives in any way.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Honestly? I think it should be considered partial payment. <br>  <br>  Times are super tough right now. And for her to offer means they know the obligation to keep up is there. They may not be able to offer you the actual dollar bills, but if they can give supplies, I don’t think you should deny that. <br>  <br>  I know it’s hard, but times are so tough right now. I do think you should consider it partial at least. <br>  <br>  Does he typically pay on time? Always? Or have there been issues before?
AA11208683	yes so far according to research,prior to conception if a male is a heavy drinker it could lead to a poor pregnancy outcome, it damages sperm as well as reduce their number and can alter testicular function and reduce testosterone levels, heavy drinking, two drinks a day  or five on any one day, during the month before conception could also affect your baby's birthweight. hope this helps... good luck!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes - he can destoy his sperm and many miscarriages occur when there is something wrong with the embryo &/or how it's all growing. <br>  Remember, the baby is 50% his DNA and 50% hers.|`|BO77Jnxqaa	yes|`|hY5JSbRBaa	Heavy drinking may reduce the quantity and QUALITY of sperm.|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	Excessive alcoholism can mutate DNA so its possible but chances are if they are a younger male, even under 40, his DNA will probably be pretty stable.

Your picture...how cute!|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Two out of my three kids did this, everytime they would start crying, they would hold their breath and pass out. Just last week my 7 month old feel down and bumped his head, by the time I got to him, he had stopped breathing, I picked him up and he was limp, my 5 year old was screaming "whats wrong with Jack", I was used to this with my oldest son so I just picked him up and blew in his face and screamed his name. He and caught his breath. I asked the doctor about this and he said some children go through this phase, my 8 year old grew out of it by about 4 years old. Its really scary, just don't panic. And I have noticed when you freak out they do it more. Good Luck.|`|258bc7a25df0158689a2a6b6ffb7c214aa	My son does this as well, he did it i front of the nurse when he had his injections and she told me to blow hard in his mouth, it works and he catches his breath instantly. It is very scarey but according to the nurse it isn't dangerous.<br>  As for her banging her head on the floor have you got a thick rug or a cushion you could put under her head to cushion the blow? x|`|5Np8w5MCaa	If you're concerned about anything having to to do with your child then you should always bring it up with your doctor.  Both my daughters cry to the point that they hold there breath and my doctor told me to blow in there face when they do it, he said it kinda of startles them into taking a breath.  hope this helps.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	wow,what a temper.  my son has one too, he doesn't go to that extent, but what does make him take another breath is if i blow in his face for a short, hard burst.  usually it catches him off guard enough that he calms down a little, at least enough to where he breaths.

K4zsztkRaa	If I ever did have a son, I wouldn't circumcise him.<br>  It's not my place. It's not my body so I therefore I don't have the right to make that choice for him.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics hasn’t recommended circumcision since 1990 because there is no significant difference between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis health wise.<br>  Also, no Medical Association in the world recommends it because it's simply not necessary. There is no reason to remove a normal, healthy, natural, functioning part of someone’s body without specific medical need. <br>  <br>  Uncircumcised men are only a mere 0.9% more likely to get an infection over a circumcised male. That's almost nothing at all, especially since infections are much rarer among men than women.<br>  Circumcision isn't cleaner, to clean an uncircumcised penis all you have to do is retract, rinse and replace. It takes 10 seconds in the shower and it's just as clean as anything else. It might me "easier" to clean but what's easier than 10 seconds? Honestly if that's a reason to circumcise then that's just laziness because it's 10 seconds. Also I believe that's for each individual person to decide I can't just assume my child will be incompetent and not clean. I haven't even met him yet and it's not fair to assume that. If he doesn't clean well that that's his issue and he has to deal with the consequences. But honestly I don't know every many people who don't clean, in fact I don't think I know one at all. I know more circumcised boys that don't clean.<br>  Also smegma actually has properties to it that help fight off bacteria and infections, the only time smegma poses a problem is when it decays which would take months without washing to get to that point.<br>  <br>  Also new studies are finding out that circumcision greatly reduces sensitivity for the male. As a male who was circumcised at birth and is now natural restoring his foreskin I can say that the sensitivity difference is very significant. My orgasms are much stronger and last longer.<br>  Sexual pleasure is a birth right and I wouldn't be able to take that away from my son either.<br>  <br>  Honestly I wouldn't. I hate the choice my parents made for me. It should have been my choice from the get-go considering it's my body and it's attached to me.<br>  I think it's important to leave the choice up to each individual.<br>  <br>  If they want to get it done later well then let them go get it. Is it gonna hurt? Yeah. But what's better? A week of pain as an adult? or a lifetime of emotional pain?<br>  <br>  I'd take a week of pain over what I have felt.<br>  <br>  I would leave him natural. I mean your husband is and doesn't have an issue. So why cut your son, if you most likely the foreskin will never cause him a problem?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No I wouldn't. It's unnecessary not to mention it hurts the baby and it's a horrible first life experience.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i`m having a lil boy in may and we are having him circumcised.<br>  And long story..|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	My son is 3 now, but yes we had him circumcised. I think that most of the time people tend to lean toward weather the father is or not and how they feel about it. Personally I can't imagine having to pull back the skin every time I needed to clean my son. I don't think that would have been fun. The only problem that I had was that he had it done at the doctors when he was 2 weeks old rather than in the hospital because he had to go to the NICU and they didn't have time to do it, and so he was a little bit older and it was heartbreaking to be in there with him, and then I don't think that they put enough nelsporin on the bandage so the first time I changed it he screamed and peed all over me and I cried and it was horrible, but besides that, everything was fine. I know we made the right decision for us. I'm am very happy that we did it.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	If your Jewish or Christian, it's a symbol of being close to God. It also is cleaner. If you or your son latter in life doesn't clean it properly it can get infected, or the skin could attach to the penis. Why not, you don't see it's necessary. I got my first born done, and will get the boy I'm pregnant with now circumcised. They do numb the penis, and the baby won't remember it. :) Plus, the cosmetics of it... it's just your call in the end. Also, that load about not geting cancer of std's is a crock. Totally untrue....|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic.

The reason... ask your husband how he would feel if he was not circumcised, then ask your girlfriends how they would feel being with a guy that was not.  Their answer will tell you why its not even an option for my son.  That is not something he can exactly fix and I guarantee a majority of men who are not are probably embarrassed about it and wish they were.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	I have two sons and i chose not to have them circumcised.my husband was not and my mom told me my brothers weren't either i dont know i just felt like why do it there honestly is no reason to do it my doctor explained to me not to do anything other then a normal diaper change until the age of one after that i had to just slightly pull the skin back during their bath untill they can learn.  The benefits of them not getting it done is cancer free,more sensation when older and many more things my kids have not had any problems with it i think its just a personal choice good  luck with it God Bless you guys and congrats.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	They don't do it often any more... It's only medically necessary in about 1/100 boys. My brother just happened to be one of them and got it done when he was 4 or so. No point putting him through it unless he wants, and he can always make the decision to get it done later if he wants (many boys do make the decision to get it done later.. I know several who have gotten it done between 14 and 20).. <br>  Also, if they find it necessary at birth, they can do it then. <br>  Some girls say not getting it is gross but I see no problem with it..|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	We read EVERYTHING there is to read on the topic and discovered it is entirely medically unnecessary. We really debated on what to do, but have decided to do it, based on a conversation we had with a DR talking to us about the amount of uncircumcised males that choose to do it in their teens out of embarrassment. Our little guy is not able to have it done until he is out of the NICU, but I will keep you posted :)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	My boyfriend and I are definitely circumsizing our son. My boyfriend is, and I guess we just see it as normal, for us. We never even questioned it. But it really is a personal choice, and if your husband isn't and likes it that way, then maybe that's what you should do. Talk it over, and you'll come to a decision together.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|VT24zOomaa	i'm not having a boy, but it's better not to get them circumcised. it's healthier. they have that extra skin for a reason. but it is ultimately you who will choose.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	I know of grown men that have had to have a circumcision due to multiple infections.   I circ'ed my son no problems.  much cleaner & less worries.  PLUS- ask grown men who are NOT circumcised - they usually say they wish they were.|`|AA11538461	I considered the pros and cons and we decided to have our boys circumcised when they were one week old.  The natural level of vitamin K is at its highest point then.  The doctor also used a local anestetic.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I am getting him circumcised, because i've heard from other mother's of boys that it gets more infected because of the extra skin.|`|6fiYhtACaa	I really agonized over the decision but finally decided to based on what my husband wanted (he is circumcised) and my personal experience working with men who are uncircumcised. I've seen a lot of nasty infections (I'm a nurse) that could have been avoided had the men been circumcised. I also thought that my hubby should have the final say being that he's a man of course and realizes the full social implictions of being circ'ed or uncirced. Is it medically necessary? No, but I made my decision after I asked my husband if he was ever angry that his parents had him circumcised. He looked stupefied and replied, "I would be angry if they had decided not to."|`|64OsCr8laa	yes because of religion and tradition|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	If I had a son, I would. My husband is, and I believe it is more sanitary. I believe it will be easier to take care of and for HIM to take care of. I think UN cut looks weird. I don't want him to have to deal with the pain of doing it when he's older. All the men in his family would be- he should be the same. It is also a religious decision for us too. We have both agreed that if we had a son, he would be circumcised.|`|2d0e2362a0c1bafcca4c468550b4eba5aa	I am not having a son, but I'd probably have it done (ofcourse when he was very very young)<br>  My husband is not, and ofcourse its clean. <br>  He has never once had an infection, and neither had my previous boyfriend who was not circumsized.<br>  The reason I would have it done for my son is because all the of them I have met during my life (including my husband) that were not circumsized, were emabressed by it since its such a big rumor that its dirty not to be.<br>  I would want to save my son the embaresement that he might feel later in his life.<br>  Damn misconceptions.|`|KPKd8dzNaa	I have 3 boys & they are all circumcised.  I looked at it this way, you can tell them 100 times & show them how to clean it, but they won't do it right.  They will get infections, possibly STD's.  No fun.  My cousin wasn't when he was born & he got circumcised when he was 20 due to constant infections.  He was in alot of pain.  My best friends dad had his done at 50.  He was in even worse pain then my cousin.<br>  If you do decide to do it, I would recommend calling your insurance and seeing if they cover it.  Also, put alot of Vaseline on him if you have it done.  It helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck & god bless.|`|Cxdxo393aa	if i have a boy *which im hoping for, i already decided i am going to get him circumcized.  only because all the men i have known who werent were very self concious of it, and also these days the medication and methods they use during the procedure makes it virtually painless for baby boy (:|`|vUVxS9Xhaa	I got circumcised when i was a baby...i dont remember a damn thing about it...so no its not truamatic at all on the baby. It would be much worse to have had to do that when i was older...so if you are going to do it, do it early...and another thing what if for some reason the kid will have to do it later in life? why not spare him the agony...<br>  <br>  2nd as a grown man id much rather be circumcised because id be embarrassed wiping out an elephant trunk for the ladies...<br>  <br>  Most women find it not being circumcised to be weird/gross and i would personally feel akward if i wasnt.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	i've been considering this as well. But i can tell you now if you decide to do it, do it immidiately after their born. If you wait its so much harder. My cousin had to wait 4 weeks and she said he screamed the whole time and she felt so horrible. I will most likely have it done if it is a boy. I say this because his father is and for us it would easier for us to know how to take care of him than to not. Besides it's something all the men in my family have had done.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	the father isn't circumcised we will not be circumcising our son, i see no medical need for it . there are millions of men who are not circumcised and they seem to be doing fine , i mean come on the baby is just born and you are already trying to cut and change them|`|AA12010051	i have a 6mo little boy and i chose not to circumcise him. i did lots of research on it. and i couldn't do it to him. <br>  here is the link to the question i asked on here about it there are some good answers and good websites to look at. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqa2z9zJS0O35DDVQZcJ7jLty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080604204346AAI7Lbb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|YFPMcHCbaa	My husband was not circumcised until he was 14. He says it was a pain to have to clean it so scrupulously. I take his word for it, since I don't know lol. If we have a son, he will be circumcised.|`|u7kDLuklaa	We are hoping for a boy in a couple weeks and yes we will have him circumcised.    I don't personally have a preference, but his Daddy is adamant that his son will have the procedure done.<br>  <br>  We are due on the same day!  Good luck!|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	I'm having a boy, I'm getting him circumcised. I think it looks weird if you don't and its easier to keep clean. My boyfriend is also circumcised and wants his son to be to.|`|OQgEvCZaaa	I'm not a woman, but my wife is pregnant with 2 boys and a girl. We've already decided we're not going to get our boys circumcised. Circumcision has its ups and downs: A big thing for boys in school is the teasing if it gets out that they are circumcised (I dont know why they tease bcuz of that but it happened to my best friend all through school). There are ups and downs for not being circumcised too: The ups is that the foreskin covers it so that it is not exposed to any means of irritation or dirt and things like that. The downside is that if he does not clean "it" thoroughly the dirt build up could cause infection (which obviously isn't a good thing). I however am not circumcised and mine is perfectly healthy and i clean it thoroughly. So i did not experience teasing as a boy but it was harsh for my friend.<br>     There are both benefits and disadvantages for both. Whether you get the boy circumcised or not is all up to you. Hope this helped!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	My son is circumcised and I'm having another boy and plan to have him circumcised as well. <br>  <br>  I choose to have the procedure done because it's a lot easier to keep clean and so is healthier for him in many ways. <br>  <br>  With it being easier to clean, you minimize bacteria, in turn minimizing the risks of your son getting an infection such as bladder, kidney &/or urinary track infections which really are serious infections to get. <br>  <br>  As he gets older and becomes sexually active, there is no "extra" place for bacteria to hide and so is less likely to get a yeast infection (yes males can get them too) and also reduces the risk of STD's (remember that the longer bacteria sits somewhere, it multiplies and spreads.) <br>  <br>  Please read below. <br>  Here's a quote from a site I found and will note under "source": <br>  <br>     "Why Circumcise?<br>  Circumcision should be a decision of the parents. This decision may be based on religion, culture, ethnicity, medical considerations, or individual choice.<br>  <br>  The religions of Islam and Judaism require circumcision. For the special needs of the Jewish circumcision please see the web site pertaining to Brit Millah.<br>  <br>  As for the cultural, ethnic or individual choice for circumcision, these issues should be left to the parents.<br>  <br>   ** Medical considerations are numerous: <br>  Cancer of the Penis. This disease, which can be fatal, is non-existent in circumcised males. <br>  Urinary Tract Infections. Urinary tract infections are significantly reduced in the first year of life in circumcised males. <br>  Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD). The transmission of STDs is significantly reduced when the male partner is circumcised. This includes HIV (AIDS). <br>  In the 7th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, held in Vancouver, beginning January 30, 2000, a study by Calvin Cohen, MD was reported. This study was entitled, Ongoing Transmission: Causes, Cases, and Correlate - Viral Load and Risk of Heterosexual HIV Transmission. In this study, the following was reported: <br>  '''Of note, they reported that the risk of male-to-female transmission was the same as female-to-male, both showing about a 12% risk per year. A higher risk was noted in uncircumcised males, with a rate of 16.7%, while there were no seroconversions observed in the circumcised men (probability less than .0001). <br>  Medically Necessary Circumcisions. Approximately 10% of uncircumcised males will require circumcision, later in life, for medical reasons. This will incur greater cost and morbidity than infant circumcision. <br>  There are many absolute medical indications for circumcision:- phimosis, paraphimosis, repeated episodes of balanitis and balanoposthitis, hygienic care considerations, painful intercourse due to foreskin problems. Men who become quadriplegic or senile often have problems with urination. These men will require the use of an external aid in order to drain their bladders. Urologists agree that placement of such an external aid or appliance can only be done on a circumcised penis thereby requiring surgery at this late stage in life. Even the uncircumcised senile nursing home resident, who does not need an appliance, still requires the indignities of having a health care aide administer his daily penile hygiene. Late circumcision exposes the patient to risk of morbidity and mortality far greater than in the neonatal period. Obviously, the psychic damage in the young child or man is avoidable when infant circumcision has already been accomplished.<br>  <br>  Further information may be found by visiting the Medicirc.org website." ** <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, this is still your choice as his parent. Good luck..|`|mvuX24PJaa	I had 3 boys and all of them are circumcised. I made this choice because w/out the excess skin it will help cut down on infection and bacteria caused by not being able to wash properly.|`|mf3OOagMaa	I have had both of my boys circumcised. <br>  But it really is a personal choice (for some a religious choice) - if you really are not sure, the best thing you can do is talk to your doctor and educate yourself to learn the pro's and the cons.<br>  Historically speaking, before the late 1800's, circumcisions were only widely performed in religious ceremonies. They became more common for western civilization - because it was a way for men to keep clean and reduce chances for disease / infection. Water and bathing wasn't as common then - especially, when you were travelling across country on a horse. In the early 1900's everyone was getting circumcised - it was the cure-all. My dad wasn't circumcised, but my brother was.<br>  For me the pro's of doing it:<br>  1. Even now, a circumcision reduces infection and reduces (not eliminates) the chance of catching an STD. An uncircumcised penis needs to be cared for differently than a circumcised one - it's not as "wash and go"<br>  2. It is a painful procedure - but better to have as an infant that wont remember the pain, than an adult that choses or needs to have it done (some question the pain the baby goes through - but forget how painful the entire birthing process is, then being thrust from dark to light - a circumcision at that age, will just seem like part of the birth experience to the baby - they wont remember)<br>  3. Normalcy - especially in the locker room, or later - in bed. Though, now we are so ethnically and culterally diverse, that I am sure that it is pretty much anything goes.<br>  <br>  For not doing it:<br>  1. It is a painful procedure and if not done correctly can severly damage the penis or become dangerously infected.<br>  2. It is more "natural" - how God created...(or is it - Judaism)<br>  3. Should this be his choice? It is "bigger" without being circumcised<br>  4. Because our culture bathes regularly, it is becomming less and less of a necessity to perform this procedure - the need isn't as it once was. You really have a choice now.<br>  <br>  Having said that: It is a personal choice - that you are making for him. Once you do it, you can't take it back. I've done my research, and made my choice - now it's up to you to make your choice - no one should make this for you. Talk with your doctor (and your husband) if you are having a hard time making this decision - they know you and will be able to help you make the "right" choice. Your husband may already have a preference based on his experience. If you are still unsure of what to do - let your husband decide.|`|THF5Da8Waa	My husband is not circumcised and takes very good care of himself. He and I both have problems with bacterial infections (I have an IUD so it could have something to do with it). We decided to have all of our boys circumcised. There are so many other things in this world to worry about, I think it is just better for us to not have this one thing to worry about with the boys. I have a home childcare (both situations) and can tell you that either way, as long as it is kept clean and there are no immune system or variable issues it really shouldn't matter.|`|J3gslQMCaa	i work with kids so i see a mix of both and if they do its much cleaner|`|yrF1q1mdaa	My husband is not circumcised and I am okay with our upcoming boy going either way. My husband has never had any problems with infections or anything and I never thought it was really weird when I first "saw it" lol. So I think we'll just discuss it and decide on how we both feel on the situation I guess. Either way I wouldn't let people's opinions on what it looks like affect yoru decision.|`|yGabEjDMaa	We did - lots of reasons... one being my husband wanted him like he was (didn't want our son to know why he was different).  Two, we did research, and at the time they said it was more health sanitary to do it.  Now, there are conflicts, but I'd do it again.  My cousin is 19, and is having it done now.  His mom wanted him to choose for himself, but he is pretty upset that he really wants it done, is is just now getting to do it.  Earlier the better the think.  My son was a matter of hours old.  Good luck in your decision.|`|5fcb6c604c9c4929c219faaa8adccfb2aa	Yes! I think you should we have 4 boys and another on his way in april and all my kids are circumsized my husband isnt and wishes he was first of all they dont have to deal with cleaning it and the baby is fine you just have to keep it lubricated with vasilen it heals in less than a week...|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	i'm not a mother, but my fiance isn't circumcised. and when we first got together over a year ago.. he was very shy about us having sex.. he barely let me rub up on him when we first started dating.. he was so imbarrassed. <br>  <br>  i we are going to curcumisied our children. he said that he went through a lot of jokes with his buds about him being different and more "uglier" as he said.. they aren't like regular penises. <br>  <br>  and he even said one of his ex girlfriends said while they were making out and he undressed,and she looked down, never seen a uncircumsied penis, she pointed and laughed at him she said it looks like an elephant trunk!.. and since her he never showed any girl his penis.. till he met me almost 7 months later..and it took another 2 monthes before he aloud me to see.. i got to know him before i saw his penis.. i figured it doesn't matter was his penis looks liked, i love him but i'm wwwaaayyy more mature for my age so i knew to get over that.. but most girls wouldn't be like..<br>  <br>  so i would circumcised your child. it hurts a lot more when you circumsed when there older..<br>  <br>  i also had a friend that wasn't circumsiced so the parents deciced to do it when he was 13. so he went and got the skin taken off, i went to his house to see how we was, and he had to wear a skirt for 3 weeks..he couldn't wear pants it hurt to bad.. i laughed inside but i felt really bad for him... he went through terrible pain..<br>  <br>  yea your baby cries when his younger because it hurts but it will heal a lot faster when hes younger then being older.. and plus do your son a favor and curcumise him so he doesn't get laughed at or made fun of like my fiance it really hurt him when he was in jr high and high school in the locker rooms. and with his ex...he will thank you in the long run..|`|4gZYucHMaa	We have a boy (almost 4 yrs now) and no we didn't circumsize him, there was no medical reason to do so.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	We didn't .  Didn't see any reason for it.  We kept it clean, he knows how to clean himself now.  No, he won't get cancer, no he won't get STD's or any of the other junk that gets thrown out as a reason to put your little one thru such a procedure.

I'm on the implanon implant.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I would be okay, I've got 3 kids and I'm in a happy marriage so it wouldn't be a problem.|`|siDcjgJCaa	I would of cried and probably thrown up and maybe not of told anyone for a while.. i would be disappointed with myself and scared... as much as I would love another baby.. NOW is NOT a good time..|`|tfYy5k64aa	They are just being careful. I wouldn't be upset about it at all, it's there job...|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Considering I stopped my birth control because I was having some nasty side effects it wouldn't surprise me too much. I'm waiting to find a new doc since mine refused to put in an IUD (just because HE doesn't like them.) So we're just using the withdrawal method (not very effective I know.) My baby is 3 1/2 months old and I want to be pregnant again...just not right now. I want a bikini friendly summer before I get prego. Though I thought I might have been in January, and I was the same as you. I took it and felt like I was going to throw up til that "-" came up. lol|`|LQuJj2y9aa	my son was only 3.5 months old when i got pregnant with this little boy. i was on birth control and everything. when i took the first test it was VERY faint so i took another... and it was faint as well... i ended up taking like 8 tests because i didnt think it was possible. i was in soo much shock i didnt know what to do. my hubby and i were only planning on having one child and then this one came along. after getting over the initial shock of it all i think he began to get excited that our son would have a sibling to play with. needless to say as i am getting bigger(22weeks) and my son is ALL over the place crawling and almost walking at only 9 months... its hard... the 2 of them will only be like 12.5 to 13 months apart... its very very rough having them back to back|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	my daughter was 2 months old when i fell with another one .. i was breastfeeding it took me 2 yrs to fall with the first and we were told well if you b'feed its a natural contraceptive ..right wrong.. doesna work i didn't want to pump my body full of drugs when i was feeding her and well it took as long to fall .. but we were over the moon and she was planned Xxx good luck Xxx|`|XpLufXKFaa	I would be extremely happy to become pregnant. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 6 months. Our son is 20 months, and up until 9 months ago, I would have had the same reaction as you. "What is my boss going to do/say?!".|`|G6eBvDz8aa	I would say there's NO way possible for one seeing as how we haven't resumed sex yet (Emma is only 4 weeks old today)... and if I found out I WAS if we WOULD have sex.. I'd.. bawl and bawl and bawl and probably smack the doctor! hahah|`|HO5lWoNDaa	Your doctor was only trying to find a reason behind your symptoms :)<br>  <br>  If you were pregnant then that would be something you would need to deal with.<br>  <br>  If you arent ready for any more kids then use protection :)|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	lol about like you.  if i were you i would try taking another in a couple days though, i'd really want to be sure.|`|QJ17P0DOaa	darling daughter is 6 months old and we are actively trying for #2!! i also am due back to work in june and my boss will be furious but i dont care-my family is my priority now and they cant fire me for being preggers-hopefully i will be well and truly pregnant by then so id love it! we only plan on having two-its what we can comfortably afford so hopefully they will be close in age and good friends!!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I'd feel pretty darn secure if I took a pregnancy test right now. Hard to be pregnant without sex.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I'm 14.5 months post partum, breastfed for 11 months, and still to this day haven't had a period. I have taken more than my share of pregnancy tests in the last year just in case.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario your (and my)  kids will still be at least a year apart. It won't be so bad. Once your son can walk and self-feed he will be much more independent giving you time for a new baby. I think I'm about ready for #2|`|zQWNb6neaa	Well, my youngest is only 7 weeks old and my husband had a vasectomy in December, so if my Dr had reason to believe I was pregnant right now I would be in quite a state of shock, alarm, and righteous disbelief ;).|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I would be nervous. Our daughter is seven months, and I'd like for her to be around 3 when we have our next child. I'd be OK though. I have a great husband, he has a steady job, and I know we'd make it...I just hope God doesn't throw us that curve ball!!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i would ball my eyes out <br>  i have no idea what i would do my son is six months old and im sixteen and i have no plans for children until i have to get my iud removed|`|dXVA1wHDaa	If I was pregnant tomorrow, I'd be calling the papers, haha, I've not had sex since before my son was born.  Oh the non-joys of being single!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, even if I was still in a relationship, it's really not my plan to have another one anytime soon.  Disregarding the emotional, physical and financial strains that comes with being pregnant and having a baby, I just want some time with my son alone, before there are any more little feet running around.<br>  <br>  Luckily enough I've had him in my early 20s, so I still have plenty of time to have more :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Well considering that this morning I was contemplating calling my midwife about the excessive menstrual bleeding (even though I'm 15 months pp, she's good to talk with) I would laugh if they told me to take a pregnancy test (I know this isn't a miscarriage, I really do)<br>  <br>  Most doctors here would have just had you pee in a cup there, they get tests for pennies each|`|gJrHBtp1aa	LOL for me I would probably pass out due to my  hubby has a vasectomy. But if he didn't I would be scared crapless. I have two kids and they are enough for me. My son is getting to the age where he's starting to become independent...but still, He'd just be getting over wanting to be with mommy all the time and then I'd have to do it all over again? No way jose!|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	We found out I was pregnant with #2 when our son was only 3 months old. If you know you're using protection but it happens anyway, then maybe it was meant to be lol. I'm glad your scare is over though. Best wishes hon (:|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	It would be a surprise because it would pretty much be an immaculate conception.  Haven't been in the mood in a while.........  :-(<br>  <br>  Elyse is 11 months though so if I really was pregnant we'd be okay.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I would be a nervous wreck. We are not ready for another child right now and I know my husband would have a heart attack if my doctor even said the word pregnant.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I'd probably freak out. And insist I get a test done right then and there at the clinic so I'm not bothered by it when I go home.|`|LhvKTYftaa	well I would do it, but what a waste of a test!<br>  <br>  I'm 11 weeks with surprise baby #2  lol...|`|860b84a941e4c725c9f29f2f5830cc9faa	I'd feel perplexed in view of the fact that I am a male

2f6diQBiaa	About 80% of women ovulate on Clomid. About half of those women are pregnant within the first 3 cycles. Women typically are not on Clomid longer than 6 cycles (if you haven't gotten pregnant in 6 cycles, then it's not likely that you will on Clomid, so they move on to something more aggressive). <br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!|`|BO77Jnxqaa	i'd also like to know, i am starting on it soon too... Good Luck!!!|`|aHWmqYY2aa	as long as it takes, sorry cant be much help. hope it happens for u soon tho|`|AA11079476	i need to know|`|MpzmnbCZaa	it could be one month up to 6 months or longer. I am going to start my 4th round of clomid and still no luck. It depends person to person. I wish you luck baby dust to u!|`|az0m4odmaa	Sorry. I was on it for 3 months and nothing happened for me either. I had very bad headaches from it and so the dr took me off of it. I am going to try this month on my own and see if I ovulate. If so then I will be back at square one if not then we will talk to the dr again and see what the next step is. Good Luck and Baby Dust!!
ZLpgjLPyaa	Are you going to a reproductive endocrinologist or a regular ob? If you have pcos(which i also do) I would reccomend going to an RE. A regular OB does not have the technical knowledge to understand the PCOS and get you the right treatment. With pcos your body tries to ovulate and produces a follicle, the follicle would usually mature and drop(ovulation) but with pcos the follicle does not mature and just stays on your ovary(you can still get a positive OPK with this) but you really are not ovulating. I was getting positive OPK's for a year and could not get pregnant I went to an RE and he looked at my ovaries and i have 12 follicles on my right ovary and 11 on the other(my body was trying to ovulate but didnt). It is alot of info but i would recommend the twoweekwait.com and go to the pcos support forum, there is alot of info and alot of women going through what you are and they can give advice, support and help. :) Good luck!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Can I ovulate without having a period?<br>  <br>  Since a woman releases an egg 12-16 days before her expected period, it is possible for women to get pregnant without having periods. Women who are not menstruating due to a certain condition (i.e.…low body weight, breastfeeding, perimenopause) risk the chance of ovulating at any point. For those who want to conceive, the lack of periods could make it more difficult to know the timing of ovulation if you are not charting temperature and cervical fluid changes. But if you are not having periods and wanting to prevent pregnancy, a form of contraception should be used since there is no way to know when ovulation will occur.|`|AA11079476	ovuating without a period sounds weird
75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	Even if you're overweight, you should still see a belly at 9 months. There have been women that didn't know they were pregnant and neither did the people around them and they ended up giving birth to full term babies. But that is rare. Losing some more weight is a good idea though, it's safer for you and your future baby. By the way, doctors usually go by one centimeter for every week. So full term, your belly (lying on your back) should be about 38-40 cm.|`|AA11538461	My waist measurement got to 50 inches.  I was 28 inches before pregnancy.|`|532XA7lkaa	Well I got big!  My first son I gained around 50 pounds which is more than I should have, but I lost it all anyway, healthily too!  This time, I'm 15.5 weeks, I am eating what I want but in decent portions and have gained too much weight anyway...but I'm sure my belly will get big.  It will also help to wear clothes that fit you well...maternity shirts that tie in the back are a sure sign of a pregnant woman :)  Empire waistlines, etc. may help you feel more pregnant-looking.  You will definitely show...but not near as early as thinner women.  I was normal weight, 140 and 5'6'' when I got pregnant, and I showed at like 10 weeks haha!  Second time around though...things were already stretchy!|`|XzbRZCPUaa	oh im pretty big and i only gained 20 pounds this is me at 37 weeks<br>  <a href="http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd315/XALICIA25X/m_b17e68e9c69248b292601ffea9247e46.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd315...</a>
c212033303d6dee73d51f858ca54346aaa	You want to keep cost in mind - so set up a theme and play games around that theme.  You can revise Pin the Tail on the Donkey to be just about anything.  A good game I like to play at my kids parties is Memory.  You put a bunch of small things on a tray, let them look at it for 30 seconds, then turn your back and take one thing away.  They have to guess what you took away.  Also dropping clothespins into a jar, from kneeling on a chair is fun.  Beanbag toss, BINGO, etc.  Have a 2 hour party so you can play some games, have some cake and open presents.  Then give out a loot bag - please no cheap useless dollar store stuff in the loot bag - try a paperback book - maybe Geronimo Stilton or Junie B. Jones.  Then send them home!  Base your theme on something your daughter likes ... in my house we have done Olympics parties, Egypt, camping, Survivor, Chinese New Year, LEGO, and castles.|`|UM9LlPWDaa	When I was 5 my grandparents threw me a backyard carnival i guess you would call it. They bought stuffed animal prizes (from the dollar store) and rolls of tickets (every kid started out with ...10 tickets). <br>  <br>  We had games like throwing a tennis ball to knock over plastic cups (easy games). They took a huge cardboard box and painted Bart Simpsons face on it. Cut out holes for his eyes, nose and mouth and we got to throw bean bags into them to get more tickets...so many tickets = toy/prize. <br>  <br>  It was awesome and to this day the best party ever. <br>  <br>  We also had cake and sang happy birthday...|`|xr7EDlWZaa	Rent a Moon Bouncerr|`|GUuFKaaiaa	well if she is girly then u can have a barbie or strawberry shortcake type thing... or if she isn't then u can have a soccer or play party with a bounce house or trampaline|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	The best birthday party i went to was in 2nd grade, it was a jungle theme and the main event was a scavenger hunt! We had easy clues to figure out where to go and there were two teams but each team had a prize at the end so it wasnt only a few girls leading the pack, everyone got involved. it was so fun and most of the stuff im sure came from the dollar store. dollar stores have a ton of stuff for parties.<br>  You could have them make their own "scavenger" hats like a jungle hat, so you have that whole thing, then eat pizza and then go on the scavenger hunt, then cake and present! im telling you the girls will love it!
SRsFkNBBaa	you should sit down and calmly explain to your parents, that you are now an adult. it would be better for you to buy a motorcycle while you are living there, becuase then they can keep better tabs on you and not be so worried. and while you have one, you can practice riding it, and become confident, and make them feel better in the process.<br>  <br>  tell this as opposed to  you  leaving and getting your own place, and buying a bike, then they wouldn't know when you were riding it or where etc. good luck!<br>  <br>  the problem is, you are still living under their roof, so that means you should respect your parents and their wishes. that doesn't mean i agree with them, but it would be easier on everyone if you could get them to compromise about the bike as opposed to just buying it when they specifically asked you not to. i wouldn't be this hard on my children, but if i asked them not to or to do something and they did the opposite, that would make me think they needed to hit the road, becuase its my house :0)|`|qYEsg4bhaa	Legally, they have nothing on you. They can't threaten to confiscate it, and they can't give it away or sell it to someone else.<br>  <br>  But think of it from their point of view. First, there's road safety. Other cars don't see you. It's dangerous to ride while it's raining. Some Dick heads speed through roundabouts, and cut people off. <br>  Then there's the people who ride motorbikes and think they own the roads. At sets of lights, they creep up to the front and overtake the whole line.<br>  That's what really irritates me.<br>  <br>  There's also the fact that you're their child. You could be their only child, we don't know.<br>  But if you are, there's always that fear in the back of their minds that some thing's going to go wrong. Whether it's your fault or someone else's, we are always hearing about motorbike accidents.<br>  <br>  I know i don't like my partner riding his motorbike. And he's not even my child.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is negotiate. Sit down with them and tell them you're responsible. Do a deal. I get my ps, i follow the rules, etc. Or you could bribe them, and tell them you'll keep up your grades, or you won't be home past a certain time.<br>  Curfews suck, but you need to prove you're responsible, and earn their trust. I agree with your parents on this one, with not trusting you'll be safe.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't argue with them. They'll see that as immature. And that won't change their minds any.|`|juU6nJqUaa	Well, they could kick you out.  Or refuse to pay any more bills for you.  Maybe you should just think about it for another year and see if it is still something you want.  You never know.  You may decide a truck is more your style in another year and then you would have damaged the relationship with your parents over just a motorcycle.|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I would definitely check into it first. My friend bought a yamaha street bike...Not sure of the model. And his insurance was outrageous!! He didn't have it long before he sold it, and he was 19. And we are in PA.<br>  Plus- I wouldn't go against my parents, what if they do kick you out.<br>  <br>  Do you have your own health insurance? Because that's considered high risk and you might be kicked off or your parents could kick you off!  Stay in school, wait until your out!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	legally nothing. Wear a REAL helmet ( not the skull kinda) and get leather. I lost my step father during a motorcycle accident and a week before that my in laws were in an accident so i understand your parents worry. Show them you can be responsible o it and you aren't using it to be a hot shot.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	hun if your 19 your parents cant tell you what to do you are an adult and it's your money so do what you want with it and tell them you will do what ever you want with your money hope i helped|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	If you paid for it and all the stuff is in your name then it is yours and they have rights over it, and if they decide to take it away then that is theft.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	unless you live in there house and they sell it behind ur back nothing|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You might want to think about buying a bike. I would buy a nice car instead. It has wipers for rain and a heater for cold days. Also you have a better chance to survive, if your in an accident. On a Mother cycle it could be death or pain for the rest of your life.<br>  Just some things to consider OK.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 )|`|YuVSDBkzaa	You're an adult. You don't need your parent's permission to buy any type of vehicle.|`|QveBSjFSaa	So... what is the age of majority where you live?<br>  If you are not a minor any more, of course you can get a motorcycle, if you pay for it yourself, and pay the insurance and registration and the gas and the upkeeep yourself.|`|AA10494763	if you are paying for it 100% and even the insurance and not going to get on their then nothing legally.|`|LWvh2g2maa	They can't do anything legally.  But you are still under their roof and they CAN make life hard for you.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	So long as you can make the payments on your own, pay your insurance on your own, etc., there's not much they can do about the motorcycle.  HOWEVER, they can make your life miserable while you're still living at home if they choose to do so.  Is it worth the battle that this will cause? Or can it wait until you're on your own?  Is the motorcycle worth your freedom?  Because instead of getting the motorcycle, maybe you could use that money to get a place of your own.  Are you somewhere where it never rains?  Does it get cold there?  Because when the weather's bad or whatever, don't expect your parents to loan you their car  to get to work or school or wherever (one of the ways they can make you miserable as I mentioned above), because you will have opted for a motorcycle as your mode of transportation.<br>  <br>  As an aside comment:  I cannot believe you'd be able to afford insurance on a motorcycle at your age in Virginia.  Have you checked into that??
Tc23KWgzaa	You can't believe everything you see on youtube.<br>  <br>  tx mom|`|AkFag8tNaa	I breastfed my oldest for 2.5 years and my youngest weaned himself at a year. I can't imagine nursing an elementary aged child but I definitely wouldn't call it abuse. I think that in most industrialized nations, the child would be ostracized if "found out" and that should play a part in the decision to nurse that long.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	I have seen this video and was disgusted my limit would prolly be 10m to 1y and nothing later!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I believe that in most cases a child should be able to self wean when they are ready. I breast fed my oldest for about 15 - 16 months and then he decided to stop (I was kind of sad, he was ready but I wasn't) My baby is only 4.5 months now I expect to continue the same way I did with my son. It is recommended that you breast feed into the second year (longer then 12 months) but I certainly wouldn't past the age of 3, nursing a 4 yr old would be a bit much for me. However if I had a 4 yr old who still wanted breast milk an I still had lots I would have no problem pumping and letting then have it in a cup.<br>  <br>  edit: How can anyone put a date on what's the right age? Do you wake up on your child's first birthday and say "happy birthday, I love you. Now give me that bottle oh and the soother, and don't look at my breasts it was fine for you nurse yesterday but today it's gross." <br>  <br>  7 or 8 may be a bit much for most of us to be comfortable with on a personal level and in all honesty most kids wean them selves long before then anyway. If mom and child are still enjoying the bf relationship then so be it. Feed your babies the way you want for as long as you want, you don't hear the extended breast feeding crowd condemning people who wean early, it's a personal choice.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	That video is disturbing on so many levels. If your kids have memories of breastfeeding and actually name your breasts... eww....<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first four to six months, gradually introducing new foods after that time. Breast milk for at least a year is preferred.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I breastfed my daughter, and weaned her at about a year.  I could only do this in the situation like when the family was stranded, no food, no nothing.  The mother breastfed both her baby and her elementary school child to keep them both nourished.  But only then could I understand it.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	I don't think it's child abuse and I think the mom is being selfish about it (wanting to hold on to the infant times).<br>  <br>  If the kid is old enough to straight up ask for the breast, they are too old to have it.|`|WQ8P57o3aa	It is disgusting!<br>  I stopped at 9 months old with my daughter and moved her on to formula. At age 7 kids should be drinking milk, juice and water...not mummy's milk!|`|W0gMQVoDaa	im horrified! i love my babies as much as the next women but this just cant be right surely!! x|`|MeYILJeSaa	I don't understand how it can be classified as disgusting OR child abuse. It's not like this woman is FORCING her children to breastfeed, they enjoy it. <br>  I just think the breast has been too sexualized. I think if a woman wants to breastfeed her children until they're 7, she should be able to without the criticism of other mothers. <br>  Also, I would think that since you breastfed your children, you would know that milk is supply and demand. You make as much as your child demands. And it's not like they are nursing for meals like a baby would, it's purely for comfort.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just want to ask you...Why is it so disgusting to drink your mother's milk, but not disgusting to drink milk from a cow that has been out in a pasture eating grass that she has also pooped in?<br>  <br>  Edit: Breastmilk is healthy. Cookies and candy isn't? Horrible comparison.  Why do you think it's so damaging?|`|b6EyFLgUaa	No no no this is wrong. I remember my grandma telling me story when I was younger ( I dont remember if it was a friend of hers or a friend of my aunts(her daughter)) when she was in kindergarten she would walk home from school with a boy. She always went to his house for a little bit for cookies and then finished walking home. Every time the boy would walk in to the house, unbutton his moms shirt and was breastfeed. She does know how long this went on becuase the boy moved the next year. Shes still freaked out by it. I think once the kids get to the point where they can verbally ask for it, they have been on the breast to long. One year would be my limit ( i tried to breast feed and couldn't) and even then it might get a bit weird. My step mother breast fed her oldest till she was 2 1/2 years old. My daughter is 2 and i have no idea how she did that. Its just weird to me.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Every few weeks another person "discovers" this video and posts a question. Lol. It's weird definitely. I plan to breast feed my son as long as needs/wants to breast feed. Most babies naturally wean themselves between 1 1/2- 3 years old.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	That is discusting. and akward.

This will save you some money!|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	i have both the comfort spot and Cosco Scenera 5-Point Convertible  i like them both but i don't like how the straps are really tight on my 2 1/2 year old daughter they are as high as they can go and as loss as they can go and in her winter coat she still can't fit in ether car seat. but i do like them both when they kids are smaller.  if i had a chance to go back in time when she need a new car seat when she out grow her baby seat i would have gotten her a 3 in 1 seat. but good luck on your chose|`|lN0GkKgaaa	I like #1 and #4 because they are Graco Carseats. <br>  <br>  I personally like Graco carseats best. <br>  <br>  My daughter has a convertible Graco Carseat and it's so easy to use and she loves it.
XOnSRoR2aa	I imagine your mom is feeling stressed and worried about your pregnancy and all that is involved in taking care of a baby, and that her snapping at you about a B in a challenging class has more to do with the underlying tension she feels rather than the grade itself. Yes, she is being ridiculous, but people can be far more ridiculous when they are tense. You should have seen how freaking ridiculous I was during exam week. I'm surprised my boyfriend didn't dump me and my parents didn't auction me off on Ebay. Oh, yes, I really, truly was that freaking ridiculous. <br>  <br>  If you are planning on going to college, and you definitely sound like you are on that path, then maybe she is worried about affording it and is hoping that you'll get a scholarship, which will be rewarded mainly because of your grades. Getting a B in a class or two won't wreck your chances, though, and colleges will take into consideration the fact that you missed school due to illness from the pregnancy. Keep working hard. <br>  <br>  You seem to be a bright girl and a hard-worker. People might judge you here and in the real world for being pregnant, but you're more than just a teenage mom. No matter what you write about yourself to try to prove to people online that you are being honest and sincere, some will not believe you, so do not bend over backward trying. You know the truth, and it's all that really matters. There are a lot of really warped, twisted people online and you do not want them knowing where you go to school and the town you live in, especially since your avatar shows your picture. I've had some really awful experiences due to not being careful about what I write online, and I wouldn't want you or anyone else to have them. Please consider deleting this question, and never, ever again write the name of your school. <br>  <br>  Take care : )|`|hstwNjNaaa	No, you have very good grades and slipping to a B in only one subject is pretty good considering you've missed a lot of school and obviously been stressed and busy because of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  They're probably just still shocked that you're pregnant, and worried it'll ruin your prospects because a lot of teen mothers drop out of or do badly in school.<br>  <br>  Keep working hard, prove them wrong!|`|vBahPYJGaa	Your mom is being rediculous. if you are doing all that and kepping all A's and only one B and you are in in like 4 AP classes. and pregnant. thats crazy|`|ZX2so3twaa	wow, i would consider a b in algebra 2 to be really good.<br>  i think your parents are expecting a little too much from you.|`|hhtrayA3aa	sweetie pie u cant take cal w.o pre cal<br>  and how to u take pe on line.<br>  and trig isnt mandatory.|`|BySnX7Gvaa	I think that that is great one B i can barley hold a C in my math class|`|rUMGPXqwaa	yes she is over reacting. i get like C's and idc what my dad says. hey tech college :)|`|xWfrA3vqaa	No offense, but don't you need to take more classes than that to graduate? I am in 10th grade and I am in Spanish 3 as well and Geometry [already took Algebra 1 and 2].  Shouldn't you take other types of classes first because if you go to college right after, a lot of people there will most likely be ahead of you in classes, such as psychics. You should be worrying about school though, instead of getting pregnant.  Most colleges want 3 high school years of a language, btw..|`|mjjhTUVEaa	hun i admire you so much! having to deal will pregnancy alone is hard, and also with soo many ap courses?! you're amazing, congrats!|`|QAmgy7oXaa	she just wants you to be a good person and looking out for you.|`|qH7IA1Staa	B's r really good! as long as ur proud of ur self and don't let ur parents put u down, keep it up! i think ur parents just want the best for you but it seems to come across a bit harsh and unfair.

PeOCqztoaa	I have heard that women are more fertile at the end of their period. The tiredness could mean you are pregnant. I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 5 weeks. I had a feeling I was because I had this funny feeling in my stomach, like butterflies that never really went away. I finally took a test and it showed up right away that I was pregnant. I never got morning sickness but I was tired all the time. I would wait a couple weeks then take a test or go to your doctor for a blood test. That will tell you sooner. Good luck! : )|`|hY5JSbRBaa	You can get pregnant at any time. It all depends on when your body ovulates. Sperm can live up to seven days. A period usually starts 10 to 14 days after ovulation (but everyone is different). So if you have a 21 day cycle, sex on your last day could very well get you pregnant.<br>  If it's been 10 days since you last had sex. Get a home pregnancy test. The First Response Early Detection (FRED) is very good. I know a lot of women who use those when they are going through IVF, it can show a positive for pregnancy before you even miss a period.|`|B1FqOGX1aa	I really don't think you Are Pregnant but hey You really never know! I'd tell you that a woman's body is amazingly unpredictable at times, but if your period finished on the 16th and you had unprotected sex that day, sperm can live inside a woman for 4-5 days, and you ovulate on the 14th day of your cycle. So if you are a 28 day cycle, then chances are you ovulated on 2/23.  So that's 7 days after you had sex, so maybe you are not, but maybe you are cause I don't know what cycle you have and if your periods are regular and etc! But Just read ur Body and know the signs and at the end you'll see the Results!!! :)<br>  <br>  But Those feelings ARE signs of early prego and also signs of stress and many other things. And You Can get some one pregnant at the end of their period, but it depends on the woman's body!!!|`|QAmgy7oXaa	That was the first thing i got then right after that it fallowed with morning sickness
prqrQcd1aa	I would assume so since legal aide is based on ability to pay or not to pay... Call legal aide in your area and ask them if they handle cases like you are talking about, and ask them this question.<br>  <br>  Honestly in my area they will not do child custody cases unless there is an active PFA in effect, or there is a case with social services..|`|E5CnUdhsaa	sure you can, i got part legal aid because i have only one income. if you are not able to get (whch you most likely will) and he is in work you can ask for him to pay the fees but id speak with the solicitor bout that|`|flqAr30laa	all u have to do is apply and they will verify income.<br>  Then they will let you know what your fees would be.<br>  its worth a call and apptmt.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Legal Aid is for people who have little or no money.  It varies quite a bit from state to state.
ulKDzHWJaa	I am toilet training my 2year old son at the moment also. He is the same as your little one - does extremely well while we are at home and he has no pants on, he will just take himself to the toilet. As soon as I would put underwear on him and leave the house he would start having accidents again, I think because he would forget and think he was wearing a diaper. <br>  <br>  So I have started making him wear underwear at home instead of letting him run around nude. He had a few accidents the first couple of days but it didn't take him long to start telling me he needed to go, so I could help him take his underwear off. Sometimes he will forget and wee a little bit in his underpants, but now he always stops and manages to get most of it in the toilet. <br>  <br>  When we leave the house now, I make him wee before we leave the house and then put his underwear on with a pullup over the top. It seems to work better then just a pullup on its own because he just treats that as a diaper. With his underwear on he feels straight away if he is wet and is able to stop. <br>  <br>  You need to keep reminding them to use the toilet as well when you are out, because they get distracted a lot more easily. Praise them for remaining dry and reward them for going potty/toilet. Also I find it helps if you take them to the toilet upon arrival at your destination so they know where it is and remind them that they can tell you if they need to go to the toilet and you will help them. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VHHis05Naa	21 months is very young.  Keep that in mind.  You're going to have to keep asking her if she needs to go while you are out of the house until she starts to tell you herself.  When we got serious about potty-training, we stopped diapers and just used underwear.  Yes, we had some accidents, but not as many as we expected.  She hated being in wet clothes and would take them off herself, which helped her to see that she could avoid that experience by using the potty.  Good luck!|`|ocNUYENRaa	I used pull ups. I'd get my son to pee before we leave the house. When he got to our destination we'd go potty again. I'd remind him to tell me if he had to pee. Then before we leave we got pee again. He's been able to be out of the house the last 2 weeks in big kid undies. If you can, praise her every time you check her when you're out if she's dry. Bring portable rewards if you can, little stickers you can stick on her hands or jackets or something edible if you agree with that.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I'm going through the process too!
aOCfLAJJaa	That's actually FRAUD. <br>  <br>  File a complaint, demand your money back and tell them get get "THEIR DAMN SYSTEM SORTED OUT!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I've never heard of that happening. The only reason I've ever known for a child to miss a school trip is an absence or not paying their share. There are a couple things you ought to do right now (that is if you haven't already). First, request to be reimbursed for the money you paid for a trip your son didn't get to participate in- insist upon it. Second, contact the principal and school board and request a meeting to discuss what happened and how this kind of situation can be avoided in the future. I would petition the board to not offer field trips that all students (in that class/grade) cannot take part in because of their numbers; or to offer the trip over two days or weeks where one group goes first and then the next. This seems like a completely inappropriate situation for your child to have been put in and the school needs to answer some questions and be accountable.|`|64OsCr8laa	i would get your money back thats stupid report it to the school board because that is normally illegal. is it a grade based trip? or anything?<br>  if it is just a class field trip then its illegal the principle is only suppose to approve a class wide trip if there is enough room for all students!! if it is a reward trip then he had to meet the requirements but if he did and they did not make room for him then its still illegal<br>  <br>  take to someone and get your money back|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Contact Offsted....that seems wrong...if they cannot all go then there shouldn't be a trip. Take your son to a nearby castle instead.|`|X2eVfKc6aa	That's terrible ive never heard of that happening !|`|cQb2vqDcaa	It's one of those things.  First come first serve i'm guessing. <br>  <br>  However, if it was an educational trip, then everyone should have been able to go.|`|JXFYdTqmaa	put in a complaint to the education department, its plain WRONG! they know how many students they have....and should have made place...take this futher its unacceptable!|`|xiXAV5ZKaa	Thats not allowed, im sure ive heard. someone i know is a teacher, read more, search google|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Never heard of such rubbish. I would contact the school and find out exactly why this occurred and how they plan not to have a recurrence in the future. No one ( schools included ) should ever single out any child and treat them different.<br>  ( Connie Mom fo 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Canada )
CIZjK2rAaa	I don't think you should go back until after Ruby's funeral and only you can decide how much time you need to grieve afterwords.  I think your boss is being very insensitive but they can not fire you for taking this much needed time off.  I don't think it is silly at all.<br>  <br>  I have been praying for you and I truly hope that you can have a beautiful funeral for your little angel and that it will give you some sort of closure.  I pray that God gives you peace and that you will be blessed with a beautiful baby when the time is right.<br>  <br>  ***An angel in the book of life wrote down your baby's birth, and whispered as she closed the book "too beautiful for earth"|`|2ObqoJbKaa	No, your not being silly. Loosing a child is a very hard thing to deal with. The co- ordinator should be more sympathetic and let you have the time that you need off to heal. I know its hard, but things will get better down the road, and you can always try for another baby again. good luck. Hope you feel better.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	No one can tell you how to feel.  You will heal in your own time.  If a person has not experienced a miscarriage, then they don't understand, doesn't matter what they say.  I have had 2 miscarriages, so I do know.  If you need more time off, then you take it.  Take care of yourself first.|`|OLHiZ045aa	Your babies body is STILL THERE and they're expecting you back in??? Heartless bastards!<br>  <br>  Take all the time you need, you come first.|`|258bc7a25df0158689a2a6b6ffb7c214aa	First of all, I am really sprry for your loss, It is the m,ost heart breaking, painful experience you will ever have.<br>  <br>  I lost my baby at 16 weeks, 2 years ago and I have a rainbow baby who is 7 months bu the pain still hits me very hard at times.<br>  <br>  I had 3 months off of work after I lost my angel and that included 2 attempts to return. I thin k your employer is wrong and very very heartless. I don't know what the employment laws are where you are from but here they are not allowed to sack you for having a month off and should support you until you are ready to go back, Next time you speak to them tell them exactly what is going on in your head and explain that if you were to return to work you wouldn't be able to give the job the attention and care that it needs. <br>  <br>  Its wrong that you are being treated like this and I really hope that the pain starts to ease for you soon. All I can say in reassurance is that it does get easier over time but don't try and push yourself xx|`|52U22fiAaa	Only you can determine how much time is enough time to mourn your loss.  Your employer can not tell you that you should be over it.  However, your life must go on so you are in a difficult position.  I would go back into work and be a "good sport", but express my concerns with the employer.  You could explain to them that you are willing to be a good employee and do your job, but you need them to be understanding that you just are not yourself right now, and won't be for a while.|`|63bxt86taa	Omg Hun!  *BIG HUGS*<br>  4 weeks is nothing, it isn't enough time to grieve, not only do you have to grieve you have to get over the shock as well.<br>  how dare the co-ordinator make you feel stupid, have they been through a fraction of what you've been through?? no?? then they should shut the f*k up, i would seriously consider making a complaint, peoples pissy reactions like that are hardly going to help you, are they? what an idiot. <br>  Its bad enough for someone with a desk job, but where you work makes it so much worse, im so sorry xx<br>  i would get a doctors note for at least three weeks, have her funeral and a week after to settle, then see how you feel.<br>  my grandparents died suddenly on the same day in 2005 (they were like my parents) i went back to work 2 weeks later and was physically sick, it was another 3 months before i was ready to go back to work. trust me 4 weeks is nothing, you need more time and screw anyone who says different you need to make time for yourself.<br>  condolences for little ruby xxxxxxxxxxxx|`|b10aMPdOaa	You are not being silly at all.  With my first miscarriage at 16 weeks, I was off sick for 4 weeks.  Like you, I went back and couldn't cope and went off sick again for a further 8 or so weeks.  With my second miscarriage, twins at 9 weeks, I was off sick for 3 months.  Go to your doctor and get signed off, after all you have just lost your precious baby.  I can't believe the co-ordinator was pissed off.  I'm assuming you work for the NHS?  I do, and I can tell you, you are entitled to 6 months off at full pay, and a further 6 months at half pay.  Please hun, take some extra time off work, you haven't even buried your angel yet, that will take it out of you.  I really hope you seek advise and / or counselling.  You need time to grieve.  Good luck hun and I'm thinking of you xx|`|dVAiuqZCaa	You should at least get the 6 weeks every woman gets when she has a baby,it takes at least that long to get your hormones normal again,and dealing with the death of your baby on top of it you definitely deserve the time off!I hope it gets better.|`|JreuGwJYaa	I dont think its silly at all.

Look after yourself and when ur sorted , go back to work. What's the worst that can happen..,..a few snotty looks ? they cant sack you. If i was you, Id see ur GP ang get signed off for another 4 weeks....tell them how ur feeling and they will sign you off with stress, depression or post traumatic stress ....whichever....dont worry, its your right to grieve ....dont let ur job stand in the way of a natural process xx|`|OEu0wy2waa	You're grieving. Your co-ordinator needs to get a grip and recognise the obvious impact that this has had on you. Impossible for somebody else to put a timescale on your return to work but you may feel less raw when the funeral is over. Just remember, if you weren't grieving you wouldn't be normal and the tears and upset are a very normal part of that process. There is no way in the world that you're being silly....take care, you will recover enough to return to work soon.|`|OfRABuiuaa	I know exactly what you are talking about.

My baby was born 20 days ago. (36 weeks&3days)at 10.41am and due to complications baby boy : became an angel At 4.30 pm.<br>  <br>  Darling 4 weeks is not enough for you to be better. i feel so sorry for what they are doing to you. if i was your employer i would at least give your 6 - 12 weeks- until you feel comfortable coming back.<br>  <br>  I know our angels are up there watching over us. I have gone out about 2-3 times after babies birth to the shops to pick up just some quick groceries and one to the park in the afternoon. but even when i go to the shops - it hurts deep inside when i see a lady pregnant or a pram & its not her fault or anything. but its so hard knowing that i dont have my baby in my arms for everyday. I know that we will meet out babies once again in heaven.<br>  I try hardest to stay strong everyday for me & my partner. but i do cry whenever i need to because. I miss Gabriel so much.but i know he is in the bestest arms now. I know its hard to be on this earth right now. Not having baby with you.So i know how you feel - But always remember - Baby is safe & watching over you. <br>  Your question brought me to tears. Because you are in a really delicate situation & your boss treating you like that is just ... " digusting" She maybe hasnt experienced this herself. but sympathy & time is needed from her for you - definitely.<br>  <br>  And you are working there at the hospital as wel in that department is going to be extra hard. I havent gone back to work since week 16. Due to bed rest. But i dont think i will be going to find a job until maybe after May. Because its just too hard. But Always remember - You baby girl is okay. We are mommy's to Angel's . You baby with always be with you.<br>  <br>  Having her body at this hospital & you being there is a definite no no. I did not have the check up for Gabriel after he passed away - due to me choosing it to be this way. So we had his ceremony on the 13/2. So 6 days after he passed away. & it gave me more peace in my heart. knowing where he is- And he is in only Baby Memorial Star Garden - Everyone takes flowers & Angel stautues & toys - to their babies & the place where you are just makes you feel calmness. Because they are in a resting place & the garden looks beautiful in a way. I think you will recieve and feel a bit of peace knowing that you can visit her there. & that she isnt at the hospital anymore.<br>  <br>  Darling dont go back - ask for at least another 2 weeks to begin with - or Tell her you arent ready to go back & you need to more time. its the best for you. Speak to your doctor he an right you a note - to excuse from work.<br>  <br>  God Bless you x Stay Strong. From My heart to Yours - My prayers are with you x Our Angels Are safe & happy with all the other angel Babies up there. <br>  <br>  Hugs & hugs xx|`|LKbMSajFaa	No your not been silly. i think you should make an appointment and go and see your doctor and explain to him and he might sign you off on the sick for a few more weeks.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	sweet heart never think of yourself as silly !!!!!<br>  <br>  everyone is different and deals with grief in different ways some people get over things easily and quickly but others take more time to come to terms with an ordeal<br>  <br>  you lost a beautifull baby girl and that will be someting that will always stay with you you'll never forget it but it will get easier, but right now you need to grieve and four weeks has not been long enough to do so <br>  <br>  i bet it took a week or so to sink in let alone for you to grieve, have you thought about seeing a medical proffession about this ??<br>  <br>  the co-ordinator is a dum *** !!! i hate it when people make you feel like that especially when they have no idea what its like as they have never experienced it them selfs<br>  <br>  i think you should discuss with your boss about having more time off they cant expect you to work there at the moment all the time your angel is there <br>  <br>  you need to have the funeral first you need to say good bye <br>  <br>  then and only then should you think about moving forward and going back to work<br>  <br>  i know you'll still have to work where you lost her but think of it in a possitive way, every day when you go to work you will be where she was brought into the world and you should feel close to her there she will be right beside you evey day "your little angel sitting on your shoulders"<br>  <br>  it will be hard take your time and do everything at your pace<br>  <br>  they say time is a great healer <br>  <br>  x x x x x x|`|DNygQdmVaa	thats normal.<br>  I had my son at 24 weeks, he survived but was very premature, I only took 3 weeks off, But I couldn stand work so I ended up quitting a month beofre he even came home.<br>  <br>  the loss of a baby is so hard, I miscarried at 14 weeks on december 15th and its still hard sometimes.<br>  i think about how far along id be, ect.<br>  <br>  <br>  your work should understand, at least try to, how you feel.<br>  <br>  My manager wasnt very cooperative with me though, my son became deathly ill and almost passed away, I missed 4 days of work because of it, and she tole me "you need to understand that Cameron is in the hospital and being taken care of, and that we need you here, tou being there isnt doing anything" <br>  I almost died when she said that.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hunni  take all the time u want, ur doctor will surley sign u off.<br>  <br>  hunni i wish i knew how u were feeling, but i cant imagine what you are going through. i lost my little 1 at 13weeks 4days and that was hard enough xxxxxxxx<br>  <br>  sweetie just take how much time u want xxxx maybe after the funeral things will ease (i know its hard to imagine but at least u can say goodbye properly xxxx and have a proper resting place for her xxx
UfGdoHnaaa	Would she report him if it was the other way around? Probably.<br>  What could she possibly need the money that she is charging her brother rent for? people who live in goverment housing only pay 30% of their income.  So you do the math is she is collecting lets say $700 from welfare maybe even less- her rent would be $210. wHAT A CROCK....wHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE BUSTING THEIR *** WORKING AND PAYING FOR HER WAY TOO. KARMA IS A MOTHER!!!!!!|`|AA11537580	if you can't prove he is paying rent then there is nothing you can do.<br>  it will only make her angry and she will probably make things more difficult for your BIL.<br>  She can easily say her brother is living there rent free, unless you have some sort of proff|`|AA11612196	Hell Yes~~~~|`|SRsFkNBBaa	well, to start off, it is actually none of the "8" year old childs buisness, where and how her mother pays for her livelihood. it never should be your kids buisness where household money goes and how much you have. so saying that, the child shouldn't know about it period. <br>  i do not think he should report it. why would he want to ruin her life like that? is she such a horribile mother? if that is the case, he just needs to go sue for custody. and quite frankly, it isn't really any of his buisness what help or aid she gets.<br>  <br>  im sorry, but i was on welfare at one point when i was down and out, a single mother. my parents, and friends from time to time, would offer me little odd jobs (i was working full time & reporting it) to make cash a little extra . that was the money that i would use to take my kids to a special mcdonalds dinner, or chuck e cheese or buy them a new toy. if not for those extra little cash jobs, they wouldn't have had nothing. <br>  he needs to grow up and find something else to do, and get his own life-rather than virtually ruin someone elses. like i said above, if she is an unfit mother, he needs to sue for full or sole custody. the issue here is for the best intrest of the child-if she isn't a bad mother, and he does turn her in, then that child loses her mother. good job daddy. jeezz...|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I hate when people abuse the system.

277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	have you just tried letting him scream it out?  either that he decided he just wants to be with you, separation anxiety.  it's no big deal, do you ever have anyone else watch him?  if not then i would see no problem with him wanting to be with you and you cuddling him.  it's been proven that mother's who cuddle their children when they have separation anxiety actually end up being more independent toddlers than children who weren't cuddled during their separation anxiety.|`|02SG8Dchaa	this is the time where they realize you dont dissapear off the face of the earth when they close their eyes so they can get really clingy and wake up at night too. they get really scared. its normal and they learn to self soothe|`|WThYT17Iaa	My son went through that when he was that age. He went through a phase around 7-8 months where he didn't want to be held and was fine playing alone then 9 months hit and WHAM he wanted to be held all the time. He would fall asleep wonderfully but would wake up screaming when he was put into his crib to sleep. That whole phase lasted about a month (maybe a little less). Now he is 11 months old and likes to be held sometimes but mainly wants to be let down to explore things. I know exactly how you feel and I can honestly say that it will get better. Hang in there.|`|WBHJ4Py9aa	they go through fases maybe he's ill? sometimes my 2 year old wants nothing to do with me only her dad and other times other way round sometimes will only go to my mum! i wouldnt worry about it unless anything else comes up like her gets ill or u realise he's scared of something perhaps in his room?? no ?? sorry i dont know|`|DVX8UVKOaa	Maybe he is feeling a little under the weather. Have you left him more than usual this week? My little boy gets really cuddly and clingy when he's feeling ill or If I have been working more than normal.|`|03c22ee76cbad52a4b0a40b6fab23c49aa	Sounds like separation anxiety...he's round about the right age for it. All babies go thorugh it. Basically it's were baby gets proper stressed out everytime mummy disappears from view which is a nightmare at bedtime! What u need to do is ...if u havent already...establish a routine. Bath, story, bed.....every night.....same time. Make it quiet and relaxing....dont get stressed when he does. When u leave the room and he starts crying leave him for 5-10 mins...then go back in and reassure him....but dont take him outta bed.....then leave the room again, this time for a bit longer.......15 mins or so.....if he's still crying go in, cover him over but dont speak to him.....leave him again....u get the idea. It is hard at first and he will probably cry for a long time but if you stick with it every night without deviating...eventually he will learn that a) when mummy says its bedtime she means it and b) just coz i cant see mummy it doesnt mean she's not there. Cuddling him to sleep wont help....you will just teach him to rely on you for sleep....he needs to be able to go off himself. Cruel to be kind. My babies were the same...it does get easier but u need alot of determination and patience. Good luck xx|`|UZ2mMaS5aa	He could be sick I know mine likes to be a cuddle bug ONLY when he is sick but what also could be going on is that he might be going thru a growth spurt or maybe a milestone such as walking.  Sleep gets interrupted here if something big is about to happen.|`|LZiDTLHOaa	is he teething? or do his ears hurt?  these two things can make it hurt to lie down, and feel much better when coddled.
KDb96QS7aa	It is a sad, sad day when patients feel they have the right to tell their doctors they MUST perform a procedure that the doctor does not agree with ethically. If health professionals were made to do these things against their will, all the good ones would leave the profession, and I can say that from personal knowledge.<br>  Let's remember too, that if he doesn't like the things you're asking him to do, he can refuse to see you as a patient the same way you can refuse him as a doctor. That's one wonderful thing about the healthcare system in the US...there are some aspects of a free market.|`|2arZOZWgaa	I think he can refuse to do it, though I don't agree with that. I doctor should be catering to the needs of his patient, instead of the other way around. How can he say that you don't need one? It's the best form of birth control out there, even more effective than vasectomy!  I would say that he has probably had some bad experience with the IUD. Maybe one fell out, maybe another patient had problems with hers. The patient is supposed to be in a monogamous relationship to eliminate the chances of catching an STD because it causes problems with the IUD. Maybe one of his patients caught an STD? I think it's crazy that you'd have to go behind your doctor's back! At least the nurse did it for you, she probably put her job at risk! I wonder what the doctor would say if he knew she did that!<br>  <br>  My anesthesiologist at the hospital didn't want anyone in the room except the nurse when I got my epidural. It was just his way of doing things. I didn't complain (no time to argue!). <br>  <br>  Oh wait, its a nurse practitioner....not the same as one of his nurses.<br>  <br>  At least you got what you wanted, think about getting a new doctor if you are going to need a lot of ob/gyn care in the future.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Yes, doctors and pharmacists are allowed to object to things based on religious grounds. Some people feel since an IUD prevents implantation that it stops fertilized eggs, which in turn "kills" the cells. Your OB can also refuse to tie your tubes. Your pharmacist can deny you the morning after pill. Its a religious thing.|`|EeGgovyCaa	You can take that complaint to the medical board people. A doctor should not refuse anything for personal reasons. If he didn't give you a medical reason for not having it, than it's obviously a personal thing.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Yes, it is his job to protect his patients.  He can refuse to perform/prescribe something if he feels it is harmful.  Some say that IUDs are not safe...  I personally would never get one.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i dont think so <br>  i hope u get one tho <br>  they are the best BC|`|SMWxmHsiaa	An OB can refuse to place an IUD in someone if they are not a good candidate for one. For example, if they have a history of excessive yeast infections, or have multiple partners, or if they are under 21 with no children. If your doctors' only reason for not using the device is simply because he doesn't like them, you might want to consider a new doctor.|`|z6IekuwSaa	It is HIS job to do what is best for the patient. He can absolutely refuse to give anyone an IUD that he doesn't feel is right for it. I would not get it done if the doc said no. There was a reason. Ask him for his reason. This nurse sounds shady. He took an oath to do what is best for his patients, not what they want|`|n2leN4ewaa	I'm not sure about that.. You should call a different OB and ask them AND CHANGE YOUR OB if hes not giving you what you want.
57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	Never spent anything on formula, since I breastfed both my children.  We used cloth diapers, so after the initial purchase (about $500 total) there was a little detergent and extra water and energy usage, but not enough to notice.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I breastfed exclusively for the first six months and we use cloth diapers. So nothing, save for the initial expense for the diapers.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	I spend no money on formula, because she is breastfed.<br>  20-30 dollars per month on diapers to estimate.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Wow, I don't know how people get by with only $20/month on diapers and $60 on formula.  I'm not saying they're wrong, but we spent quite a bit more.  We live in a small town, so we bought formula and diapers once a month when we traveled to a bigger town with a Wal-mart (lol).  We bought 2 cases of formula and 2 cases of diapers and that would last us just about exactly 1 month.  The formula was $144.00 for 2 cases (12 cans at $12 each) and the diapers were $50 (2 big boxes at $25 each).  Maybe if you have more options of where to shop you can get then cheaper (?), but that's what we spent.  (And those numbers are *very* close to right.  Not just an estimate)|`|n3PE2lvDaa	i breastfeed but we probably spend around 40 bucks a month (new zealand) on diapers|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	$0<br>  <br>  I breastfeed and we use cloth.|`|DvnOIx1laa	I spend forty dollars a month on diapers and 0 on formula she if breast fed|`|c73QkZ2haa	Im in Ontario.

52bAHCaUaa	Car seats expire. So yes, that's a good item to buy new. I know the hospital where I had my daughter wouldn't have let me take her home in an expired car seat, they would have given me one of their own. <br>  <br>  I think if a crib is in good condition, then that's great! In my experience with cribs...my daughter slept in hers for a few weeks. Then she slept with us! I put up a cradle in our room (trying to save room) and I think she slept in that one night!|`|iMULlxdgaa	well since my first is almost 4 (and we gave away his old newborn carseat)  I had no choice but to get another one.  If you have a carseat that is working properly and is not very old then by all means use it!  We are using the same crib becuase we have it still and its in good condition.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you have a family member of close friend that you trust you can use a seat from them.  Most people wouldn't knowingly give away a seat that isn't safe because it has been in an accident or stored improperly but that's not a guarantee and you can't tell if a seat safe by looking at it.  And of course when paying for a second hand seat I'm sure you are aware that sometimes the need for money outweighs some people's scruples.<br>  <br>  Second hand cribs are safe provided that they meet modern safety standards, and aren't damaged.  Basically check that:<br>  * when assembled things aren't loose<br>  * that any spaces between bars can't fit a pop can through<br>  * If there is a drop side it should take two actions more than an infant's arms span apart to drop it (though there are exceptions particularly in cribs for handicapped moms)<br>  * In Canada the mattress platform can't be held up by springs or hooks.  I believe in the US springs are still allowed.  Just make sure its not going to drop if jumped on really<br>  * No gaps around the mattress, it should be very snug<br>  (Most governments have pamphlets for moms buying second hand cribs.  Also you don't necessarily need a crib, there are other options)<br>  <br>  One thing that you should always buy new for EACH child is a crib mattress. The fire retardant chemicals break down over time and can leach out which may be unsafe.  Crib mattresses also breed mold, dust mites, etc and because of the risks of SIDS and allergic reactions its just not worth reusing a crib when you can get decent ones relatively cheap.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_4858421380" rel="nofollow">http://www.epinions.com/content_48584213...</a><br>  Days later, my husband spoke to our car insurance agent to find out whether our insurance would cover such an expense. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that it was not necessary to replace our seat after all. The agent pointed us to the new guidelines issued by the NHTSA, which deem unnecessary to replace ones car seat after a minor accident that meets the following criteria:<br>  <br>  1.You were able to drive your car away from the scene of the crash.<br>  <br>  2.The vehicle door closest to the child safety seat was not damaged.<br>  <br>  3.There were no injuries to any of the occupants of your vehicle.<br>  <br>  4.The vehicle's air bags did not deploy.<br>  <br>  5.There is no visible damage to the car safety seat itself.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, we met all the previous criteria and my new car seat does not have to be replaced. I can breath with relief, because the safety of my car seat was not compromised and I don't have to go out an buy another one.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would reccomend buying a new carseat but if you know someone who has recently had a baby and the baby outgrew their infant seat then it wont hurt to use it. The main issue for buying newer items is safey regulations. Obviously a crib made 10years ago may not pass now. So just make sure you know info on the crib before purchasing one from a used baby shop or what not. If you look around though and dont buy things asap..you can find new things for very cheap. My friend just got herself a brand new crib at a jc penney outlet store for 60 dollars! The crib was orignally $189!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	All car seats have expiry dates on them, so check the date and make sure it hasn't been in an accident.  If you can't tell, you should pass on it.  Cribs can be recalled or have features that put the baby at risk of injury or even death, so again check out the models you're considering to make sure they are up to standard.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	Not always, I didn't buy either new. My mom just had a baby a year and a half ago so I got both the car seat and her crib.  My baby was born last year so the stuff wasn't too old.  Make sure if you use the car seat to look on the bottom because they do have expiration dates on them. As long as it is not expired then it should be ok.|`|UZ2mMaS5aa	You don't have to buy everything new, I sure as heck didn't!  True car seats do have an expiration date but most resale places wont even carry ones that will go out of date soon and assuming you check out the date and know a little math you can figure out if it is a good buy or not.  Most car seats have a 20ish lb weight limit most babies are grown out of the infant type car seat by the time they are 9-10months so if a seat has 2 years or more left on it then I don't see why you couldn't use it.  As for the crib when you go "shopping" know that most people with recalled cribs get rid of them, a mother would not knowingly put a child in danger hers or not.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	yes you should buy the car seat new because you dont know if the person is lying and the seat was in an accident. If it was in an accident it shoudl not be used again. it might be defaulted after the crash EVEN a 5 mph crash. As for the crib it is some what safe to get used if you know its clean many issues are bed bugs can live in the mattress and the wood.|`|WThYT17Iaa	Car seats are always best to buy new for two reasons. First, you never know if they have been in an accident before. If so, there could be some unseen structural damage that could put your baby at risk. Second, car seats expire (along the same lines of the structural damage but it is more of a breakdown of the plastic). <br>  As for the crib, I bought my used. I researched it first and made sure there were no recalls on it.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Yes I would advise you to buy a new carseat because it concerns the safety of your child. Who knows how someone else used their carseat and how long it was used for.....too much wear might make the carseat weak...so to be on the safe side I would suggest a new carseat. As for the crib....we bought our daughter a used one from a friend. All we did was buy new bedding and made sure everything was clean. It's a good thing we bought a new one because she doesn't even sleep in it!...only for 2-3 mths....she's 10mths now and she sleeps with my husband and I. So my advice..new carseat...as for the crib..used is good enough.|`|FPaZ5mWCaa	They say buy the carseat new so you know that it is entirely safe, buying second hand you do not now what it has been thru, it may have even been involved in a car accident. I had a 2nd hand crib, no probs.<br>  <br>  x|`|pVaZty4Maa	i bought both new bc i thought it would be best for the baby
tdNfQWaAaa	I've been TTC for 5 months... no luck at all. I have been taking my prenatal vitamins for the last month though, so not the whole time. I used some ovulation predictor kits for 2 months, and I couldn't get an accurate reading so I talked to my doctor about it. He said some women will never get accurate readings and dont waste your money. Just track your period and your cervical mucus. Gross I know. I have been charting my cervix a little, but its not really a good enough sign to go by. It can change so much. I would chart my temp, but that will only tell me after I ovualted. But I would just watch for discharge, and when its "egg white" and then really stretchy, go for it!!! Then wait it out and go back to the doctor if you don't get pregnant in 3 months...

The other small percent get pregnant after 12 months. <br>  It took about 3 months for the pill to get out of my system, and only now my cycles are starting to go back to semi-normal (how they were b4 being on BC) I was on the pill from a teenager to help regulate my bad periods/cramps and Im now 31 so that has possibly lowered my fertility chances (im guessing) <br>  We have recently adopted a heathy new lifestyle, we have both lost a lot of weight (I was 15 kilos over weight) eating healthy and going to the gym 3 times a week. We just keep trying :) <br>  <br>  Baby dust to you x0x0x
9ed11726ae35f3e6ff57b2bd2d772f87aa	Children can be difficult when it comes to health. My son use to have a simple routine but sometimes he would break out of it ie if he had an action packed day in nursery or school, if he didn't sleep very well the night before, if he was feeling unwell or even if he didn't eat properly.<br>  So I wouldn't worry too much, just make sure she is not hot, or ill, ask her what she did at the creche. See how she reacts. If you yourself think there is something wrong or very unusual you can ring NHS direct or your doctor. Ask the creche to find out if they did something different there as well.

And probably even before as the baby grows and interacts more, even in your womb.  The kicking, the moving, the responding to his voice.  Have him read nightly to the baby.  My husband did that with all 3 of our children and when they were born they immediately responded to his voice.  And it's fun when the baby is kicking and moving inside.  The baby will respond to your husband reading.<br>  <br>  I have worked in childcare forever.  I have had more than one Dad admit he was REALLY hoping for a boy.  But they also admitted they couldn't imagine anything else. He will get there.  It will be OK.  <br>  <br>  Below is a link to a book that comes highly recommended.

Gianna: I really like Gianna. Plenty of nickname potentials, such as Gi, Gigi, Gia, or Anna. <br>  <br>  3. Addison: I love this name, but I don't think it works well for an adult.<br>  <br>  4. Lexi: Again, I don't think simply Lexi fits an adult. It's too little girl and cutesy. I'd prefer a name where Lexi was a nickname, because I do like Lexi for a child.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	Addison-----2<br>  Juliette-----4<br>  Lexi---------1<br>  Gianna------3<br>  that's my order, but the only one i like is lexi|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Addison3<br>  Juliette2<br>  Lexi 1<br>  Gianna4|`|fZGcufB7aa	1.

MEnKHoJwaa	Well first I'd say that, religious views aside, dealing with unwanted pregnancy is not fun. It adds stress to your life & costs $...going forward make sure you get on the pill! Check out a local "Planned Parenthood" spot.  They'll probly give you free condoms too.<br>  <br>  As far as abortion goes, there is pain involved. Will probably cost you somewhere in a ballpark of 4 or 5 hundred. And sure there are risks too...but less risks than having a baby.  So take care of yourself....|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	my god grow up. USE BIRTH CONTROL. DUHHHH!!!|`|T6xd0OxWaa	You know I'm an atheist.   And in my view anyone would do this deserves to get lobotomized.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=abortion&gbv=2" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a><br>  <br>  Knowing that exists makes me wish a hell did exist, so worthless child killers would tortured for all eternity for what they did.<br>  Guess I just have to settle for the more common than most think, complications during abortion, including death from being scraped on the inside, having your intestines sucked out through the cutherage used to kill your child.    Oh and don't forget the possibility of having a lot less chance of ever getting pregnant and a higher chance of miscarriage in the future.  Not to mention the increased chance of breast cancer caused by your hormones being thrown out ofwhackk from the abortion..<br>  <br>  Well what ever you decide I hope you get what you deserve.|`|twHXC9Draa	i hope you know most preo women hw=er arnt so eager on giving baby killing advice to a grl who is going to h*** fo even thinking of having one.why arent you smart well idk? just give them up to an adoption program! you will not regret it! i know a girl who had an abortion(my EX bestfriend) and now everyone hates her because she had one.youll be praised fo doing the right thing and that is to not kill.....|`|52U22fiAaa	I don't think you're going to find pregnant women on here giving you abortion advice.  If that were the case, there'd be a section on yahoo Answers for "Abortion" questions.  Therefore, you're probably best off researching the costs from your local abortion clinic.|`|frpCK0utaa	So you were having un protected sex with a bag of sh** guy, and now you're knocked up? Congrats, the idiot table is this way.|`|sLERr3aAaa	dumb s hit|`|kd4clPz3aa	First of all, don't get an abortion. Just think for a second about looking down at your beautiful baby in your arms and how amazing it is that you were the reason that this tiny little person gets to live his or her life. By getting an abortion, you will be taking away the opportunity for your son or daughter to live the best life he or she possibly can. Abortion to me is like murder in a way. Because, born or not, that baby inside of you is still a person. It's still a human being. And if you abort it, it's the same as killing your baby after it's born. So, if you are not capable of raising this child, then let someone who is capable have it and give it the best life possible. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps at least a little bit.:) Good luck with everything.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	First of all your OBVIOUSLY too young to be having sex. It was obvious by reading your question. Second you need to really stay in a child's place and not be having sex. And since you wana play adult games and do adult thing take RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS! Why the hell do all of you think abortion is a form of birth control! Put your self in the baby's position. Would you want mommy to kill you? Would you want mommy you have you vaccumed out of her tearing your little precious body apart hurting you in ways no one can imagine I doubt it. And last but not least you cant get an abortion without your PARENTS being there!!!If he's such a bucket of s*h*i*t then why the hell are you wasting your time anyways. All of this makes you look extremely immature and dumb!|`|ikpKEqIlaa	Whether you believe in God or not is no excuse for being so irresponsible.  An abortion is not fun to go through regardless of your religious beliefs.  I had an abortion on Wednesday, and you would not believe the physical pain I'm in right now.  An abortion is just not something you should take lightly.<br>  As far as risks, abortion is relatively safe these days, but as with any surgery, there are risks.  You could have a reaction to the anasthetic (sp?) or develop an infection afterwards.  As I said there is the physical pain, many women also experience alot of emotional pain.  As far as costs, that depends where you live.  I'm in Canada and it's free in my province, but in some other provinces it's $500.<br>  As I said, if you want to have sex, be mature about it.  It's attitudes like yours "I'm 16 and can do what I want" that's the reason people say kids shouldn't have sex.<br>  REMEMBER: SAFE SEX IS ABOUT RESPECT, NOT DISTRUST|`|kowMNYPsaa	omg! Ive been having unprotected sex too! Want to go to the abortion clinic together? It will be like a girls day out! :)|`|xL6McXTfaa	Your comment on Jesus was COMPLETELY unneccasary.
b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	if he is not sleeping he will have that exhausted look to him... BUT if you truly feel something is not right CALL THE DOC asap. Go with your gut feeling you know your child best. i was in the hospital and thought my son looked ill and was not eating right and was sleeping more. I had the nurse take his temp she said I was being worried mom.. next morning his blood sugar was LOW> then when we were home he was eating more fussy (eatin every hour crying and barley sleeping) I knew something was wrong called the doc and he did not gain wieght turns out he was having a bad reaction to my milk. If you dont feel he looks right call his doc and take him in better safe then sorry but it might only be he is over tired.... But if he is getting ill the saline drops are a good help for a nasal issue GL|`|46K4FtE0aa	The red around the eyes doesn't sound right, but not a lot to worry about, i would simply have a trip to the doctor, explain what you said here and he will know if there is any need for concern. Sometimes babies get a little red around the eye and then the eyes start to produce matter and baby sometimes can't open its eyes until you bathe them with lukewarm water, it is normally a slight infection which can be treated with an eye gel.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	if he starts getting really water stools, you should take in to get checked out, the diarrhea isn't dangerous,but they can get dehydrated from it.  signs of dehydration are being grumpy, the soft spot on their head is sunken, eyes look sunken, ect.  if he looks tired, maybe try feeding him more often, he might be out of energy from growing and moving.  he less likely to get sick even if you were if he's breast feeding, but it's not impossible.  you can always call the nurse on call, they don't charge.  and will usually know more than the people who will be answering this question.|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	probably normal. Esp the sleeping. They will slowly start being awake more. If you're concerned about the eyes then mention them to your doctor. My daughter's eyes got red like that right before her tear ducts became blocked. Now they are like that all the time and have gunk until we can get them unplugged or they do that on their own.
d14ce369f05c355a7fa3761910e845e8aa	First, let me tell you that boys are way harder to potty train than girls are. I too was asingle mom and had to toilet train 2 boys and they did not get fully trained until 5 or so! I found that the best thing was to teach them by example- I would take them into the bathroom with me when I had to pee and tell them I was peeing, etc. and asked them if they had to use the potty. After a month or so, they took the incemntive to pull me to the bathroom and ask me if I had to go potty (THEY were the ones that had to go)<br>  <br>   It takes a whole lot of patience though. My daughter always went to the bathroom with me and just went on her own at around 18 months, really early, I think-but the boys ! Good luck!|`|THdzJQqNaa	do not spank your child. for getting angry with children will just make them hate you. this is how my mom got me potty trained. 1. tell your son that you hold your private over the tiolet and pee in the tiolet. this may sound perverted but im just trying to help. 2. tell him that if he pees in the tiolet for 5 mothes without making it on the ground, tell him you will buy him a gift that he likes. 3. buy him the gift if it works try telling him that you will give him stuff if he does it right. kids these days love gifts lol!|`|YuowZPSFaa	First of all you shouldn't just start with nothing.  He doesn't know what to do.  Put pull ups on him and go from there. I have a three year old daughter that has no interest then all of a sudden it was her ideal and she was ready. Don't spank him that is not fair.  Don't expect too much out of him or it will take any longer. You might have already made it a big deal for him by spanking him for potty on the floor.  Paitence Grasshopper, it will come.|`|1tHVDSRJaa	Have you spoken to your doctor?<br>  Some boys take a lot longer to train than girls. Just hang in there.<br>  Don't get cross with him though, even when it is very frustrating, as he will get anxious and make it worse.<br>  Rewards do normally work. If you go out, stick him back into a nappy.<br>  As he gets older he will probably get embarrassed about the nappy which is for babies, not big boys, and want you to take it off.|`|hioGjQumaa	well i dont have kids yet but the way my stepmom did it was she didnt put pants or underwear and they didnt want to pee all over themselves or on the floor. how that worked is beyond me but you can try it.... me and my sisters were just trained normally so idk.....|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	just let the kids pee on the floor and save yourself the hastle of the job|`|SH07M84maa	Just be patient and try not to get mad at him - I know it is hard. I knew that boys took longer than girls to be toilet trained, so I did not even bother with my son until he was 3.5yrs. It did not take too long there after.<br>  <br>  A good game to play is put cheerios or similar in the toilet, and he can play a game of hit the target with his wee! This is just to make the process fun for him. Or, sometimes my little boy thought is was fun to go out and water the grass!<br>  <br>  But again, just be patient - he won't be peeing his pants when he is 20, so he will get it eventually. When you go out, just get him to go beforehand  and then put some pull ups on him for the outing.|`|oeW1WDXfaa	Put a bell next to the toilet so when they go potty they get to ring it|`|kjaoFGeiaa	have you tried pull ups with him? They have one's that when he starts to go he will feel a cold feeling and it signals that he needs to use the washroom. He could also not be quite ready. to train yet. Some kids take longer than others.|`|5DpDAH6Saa	I am a 21-year-old guy and my nephew, 3, does the same thing. Your son won't always tell you when he has to go, or sometimes may try to make it into a game. But there are things you can do.<br>  <br>  First, if possible, try to find a male friend that you trust to try and take him. That way, he'll be able to learn how to do it as he gets older. Be sure to take him about every hour or so to start. Then you just increase or decrease the time between trips to bathroom as needed. Keep up with the treats and prizes. While some may consider that bribery or spoiling the boy, it is actually a good source of motivation. Eventually, he'll be able to go without wanting or needing the prize. Most importantly, Diapers! Yes, he does need to be able to use a toilet like you or me. But the occasional accident is going to happen. If you think that he may not be able to make it, then put one him.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	I watch my 3 1/2 yr old nephew & he still poops in pull ups. No matter what we do. I tried everything-even told him he would have to eat the poop (joking of corse) he just starting crying.  I guess it just takes time.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Sounds like my grandson. Hes still not got it all down and hes 5 years old now. Its about sitting him down every 1.5 hours if need be. At the mall at home, freinds, any where anytime, and it means getting up every few hours at night and sitting him on the toilet or holding him up to it, even though hes asleep. Boys mature slower than girls, that is ell known. Each child is different, every single one, so he could simply be a 3 yr old boy thats too busy and too distracted to do this thing that to him is a waste of his time! Has a physician evaluated him for his age development? Im not saying this to scare yor or anything, it may be that at this age, is the actual first time he might of needed to have potty training done. Its about consistancy, and making it a priority over all else in your life. Everything takes a back seat, and you live your day for a few weeks, to simply do potty training while maintaining your sanity!!!! Also, announce when you need to go, even fake it, to go into the restroom together, oh no, I gotta stop doing this and go pee, ok lets go and you both go, and sit and sit and sit, have a book there, whatever. Try giving him lots and lots to drink one day, so that you know hell be going alot and on that day do the reading and singing and just hanging out in the bathroom so that he can be successful going in his own potty. Its tough, but it could be, that all that training you have done before might of been done earlier than he was able to handle???? good luck hun, I hope its soon for you.|`|kuBXTToGaa	ok i know potty training is real hard and all but u may want to try daycare while he is in there and sees all the other kids using the potty hes gonna want to go thats how i got my 1yr old using the potty. also u may want to bring this up with ur dr because sometimes it can be a medical reason my cousin is 7 and recently found out that there is a medical reason behind her peeing in the bed at nite well good luck hope all goes well 4 u|`|3vWpUXsmaa	I am going through the same thing. But let me tell you now, DON'T spank your child just because he had an accident. Why would you punish him for something he can't control? There is no better way to make a kid hate potty training than the spank him. You need to be patient (believe me I know it's hard) and know that when he is ready he will do it.|`|PMuAITczaa	make up a little game or something, to try and influence him to going 'peepee' in the potty? :]<br>  Or you could say 'Peepee goes in HERE' and point to the potty<br>  <br>  Hope ive helped|`|WPI0Z47saa	My son is also 3 1/2 so I feel your pain. The truth of the matter is that he still just isn't ready and the more that you try to force it, the further away from the goal you will push him. Punishing him will only make matters worse. You just have to make the potty available to him, encougage him. talk about the potty and let him go at his own pace. It isn't unusual for boys to be 4 before they are trained. It will happen. My neighbor's son just finished potty training at 4 1/2. He was using the potty for awhile but still had some accidents until recently. One day he just stopped and never had an accident again. Just please don't punish him. It is stressful for them also. We think it is so easy because we do it but it is truly a major milestone for them. Good luck.
W0gMQVoDaa	there is a condition called selective muteness when a child can not communicate with people in certain situations i would look into this if i were you xx|`|A2em9ZXOaa	Is English your second language? Do you speak to her in English at home? I am asking because it seems obvious from your note. If that is the case, and you are concerned with her social development, perhaps you and your daughter could work together on your language skills with a trained therapist. If that is out of the question, maybe you could read to her more. (You may already do this, but it is just a suggestion). <br>  <br>  You sounds like you are a good Mom. Best of luck to you and your daughter!|`|lBRzCIPQaa	I dont have an answer but I can offfer advice. Your girl is only 3 years old. Is she an only child? What you should make a habit of is asking her questions. Like "who makes you laugh at school?" " who do you like to play with the most when your playing?" Also once you can get a few more answers out of her, give her the ropes. Supply her with treats to give out one day for snack and have her pass them all out to everyone. If there is a sharing day have her talk about three things about the item in front of the class. Make her some "business cards" with her name and number for play dates and have her hand them out to the kids in class or to her friends. These are just tips to help her get out there and socialize more. It does take time and there is nothing wrong with an observer. They are just thinking before doing which is a great trait to have. She will slowly come around give her time.
TJusfEnlaa	This sounds exactly like me and my partner. From the minute we met we knew we wanted to have a baby together but we were busy with life so we just decided if it happens, it happens. We had unprotected sex for 3 years before I became pregnant. we were both too scared to go get a check up to see if there was something wrong with us, and we were in our early 20's so we weren't desperately trying for a baby and just thought we would worry about it later if need be. Then all of a sudden I was pregnant and now we have a beautiful 9  month old son. I have also since became pregnant and sadly had a miscarriage in this time. <br>  It will happen when it is meant to be. :) good luck.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Typically one would wait until a year of trying unsuccessfully to conceive before talking with the doctor.  And you are trying to conceive if you aren't using birth control.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I will tell you this - when I was married to my husband we tried for 1.5 years to have a baby - I even tried fertility drugs for two months towards the end.  It never happened.  I thought the SAME as you - I didn't think I could get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I ended up getting pregnant a couple of years later after our divorce (with someone else of course) VERY easily.  It can happen.  I would suggest maybe trying for another 6 months and if it doesn't happen then maybe talk to your gyno about it.  They usually won't test you unless you have been actively trying for 1-2 years, or at least mine wouldn't.  <br>  <br>  **Also, it's alot easier for the guy to get tested.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	well sounds to me like you are trying.  You cant try much harder then that to get pregnant! i wouldnt worry just yet. It is perfectly normal to take up to a year to fall pregnant. Every month that you are actively trying to get pregnant you only have a 20 percent chance of falling pregnant. My sis in law took 11 months to fall pregnant with her first and only 1 month to fall pregnant with number 2. I have heard that you should go and have tests done when you have been trying for over a year. It dosnt mean you cant get pregnant if it you havent in a year but doctors will start to take the problem more seriously. Six months isnt very long to be trying for. Its quite normal|`|tdHIR9cLaa	Don't worry! me and my boyfriend had unprotected love making for a year before we got pregnant!! don't start to stress unless you are "trying" maybe you are not getting pregnant for a reason...<br>  <br>  just don't worry! and when you are trying and nothing happens you could always go get tested to see if you or your boyfriend are fertile|`|EeGgovyCaa	There are tests you and your partner can take to find out who is or maybe reproductively challenged. <br>  <br>  You can't say that you are trying to not have a baby when you continuously have unprotected sex.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	there is only a couple days <br>  maybe even a couple of hours within those days u can get pregnant<br>  <br>  so if your not having sex every day of the month or you are not trying then i dont think u have a problem|`|XpLufXKFaa	Everything happens for a reason. <br>  <br>  I got pregnant with my son when I was on the pill (and taking it religiously!). I also had my period for 3 months while I was pregnant (also, very odd). Now that our son is 20 months old. We have been trying to conceive for the past 6 months and absolutely nothing. <br>  <br>  I thought I just had to think of getting pregnant, and bam, I would be pregnant, but, apparently not.<br>  <br>  If it is really a concern of yours then you should go to your doctor and get checked for fertility, and also, worst case scenario, it could be your partner, not you!|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I was having unprotected sex with my hubby (we were pulling out) it lasted 2 solid years. When we decided to have a child it took 4 months of trying to get one. You might not be hitting your fertile time. I was thinking the same but  got prego ( and I know the pull out is not a BC method we were just trying to lower the chance lol)|`|46K4FtE0aa	Well to start with, you have to have been trying for 12 months before the doctor will send you for checks. So just wait another 6 months and if you still have no luck then consult your doctor, with some people it just takes a long time to succeed, it all depends on how fertile you and your partner are.|`|HO5lWoNDaa	I think you should start using protection<br>  <br>  You yourself said you arent actually trying so why even bother having unprotected sex?<br>  <br>  When you are officialy trying for a baby it should be done with love and passion and not with the thought "oh well if i get pregnant its not that bad"|`|bnbXMlIpaa	i wouldn't worry too much. my husband tried to get pregnant for almost a year before i got pregnant with our son. sometimes it just takes time.. there are only really 2 days a month you can get pregnant. don't worry too much.. you could always go see someone to find out if there was anything wrong.|`|Xc02z608aa	If you are actively having unprotected sex and would be thrilled at having a baby, then you are trying, dear.<br>  <br>  If you have concerns about your fertility, see a specialist and get checked.  This will belay your fears.|`|TfzXJcvuaa	Maybe you should wait until you both have the things you want in life first. Don't get me wrong, kids are great but you should definitely get things out of the way first. Maybe this is gods way of letting you do just that|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	were you using bith control?  if so how long?  if you were using it for many years before you stopped, it can still stay in you system.  somone i know had been on it for 5 years, the same one same dose and when they wanted to get pregnant, she stopped taking it.  it took two years for her to get pregnant after that.  she had been moving around and had different drs.  i guess they'r supposed to change the birth control everyonce in awhile, but since she had had so many different drs, it hadn't ever been changed.  she now has an adorable little one year old girl.  if you're worried about it though, you could ask your dr about it the next time you go in for a check up.
u7kDLuklaa	I did.  I got pregnant about a month into my 3rd shot.
413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	you could have a allergy, to something like a detergent, or something you ate, or even you could have the chicken pox.. it could be anything. it also could be scabies.. its something you get from your partner after having sex.. i had the same thing from my ex boyfriend there little microscopic bugs that hide in creases of the skin. like your breasts, stomach and the lower pelvic area. you need a special lotion from your doctor.. and you need to have anyone in contact of you needs to use the cream.. so theres a lot of different things.. so you need to go to the doctors!!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I don't think this is normal....<br>  <br>  Is there any chance you might be developing an allergy to something? or are you using new detergent or soap?  or maybe wearing new clothes or perfume?<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt a minor rash would harm the baby or the pregnancy, but for peace of mind (and to ease your discomfort), please make an appoint with your doctor and speak to him about it.|`|AA11208683	either way i would call you doctor just to be on the safe side... they would know better to what it is then we do, but to me it sounds like you have eczema, if it is eczema here are some things that will help with the ichtching.... use a cold compress not you fingernails, scratching makes it worse.... limit contact with irritants like laundry detergents, household cleaners, soaps, bubble bath, perfumes, cosmetics, wool, pet dander, plants, jewelry, and juices from meats and fuits, moisturize early and often while skin is damp to lock in skins own moisture, don't spend to much time in water especially hot water, try not to get too hot or sweaty, try and not get too stressed our that is a trigger for exzema as well as anxiety. there are other things it could be but this one is one of the most common. other wise i would check your temperature, it could be fifth disease. but fever is present only 15 to 30 percest of cases, for the first few days the rash gives the cheeks the appearance of being slapped, then spreads in a lact pattern to trunk, bottocks and thighs. but either way call your doctor..... GOOD LUCk, i hope this helps.|`|JreuGwJYaa	Well do you have any animals? Like a cat. Pregnant woman get scabes easy and that could come from any animal that goes outside or uses a litter box its nothing that you would have done bad so if thats what it is dont feel nasty or anything. But you do need to get it checked out nobody on here can confirm it.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	it does sound like an allergic reaction to something. which is common. i'd go to your doctor to figure out what exactly is causing it though. i am suddenly allergic to band-aids (the sticky part of them). i get weird rashes when they come off. this has only happened when i got pregnant.|`|bzQNHfunaa	sounds like puppps 2 me...check out all preg sites and go c ur doc|`|tF3t2rSaaa	Call your doctor it sounds like you have Pupps it is a rash un pregnant women that can be very itchy and annoying.They can give you cream to help with the itch but I would call doctor a.s.a.p. Good luck|`|Dd6y8YDfaa	It could be maybe a heat rash or something.<br>  <br>  I'd get it checked out for peace of mind though,

pXSKSS3daa	Creams and lotions don't work, unfortunately. If you're going to get stretch marks then you're going to get them. I didn't get any until around 37 weeks.<br>  <br>  My son is now almost 11 months old and they're pretty faded. You can only tell if my skin stretches and even then they are just silvery looking. They won't EVER be completely gone, though, so you're stuck with them(unless of course you opt for some plastic surgery but that obviously could run you into the thousands).|`|AA11297999	I started to get stretchmarks around my due date (I went 2 weeks over!)... I think really if you get them or not during pregnancy has a lot to do with genetics.  I also lotioned, kept hydrated and kept my preg belly out of the sun.  I'm 6 months postpartum now and they are almost flesh color (I have pale skin).. but when the sun hits them the skin is different.  They never completely go away.  I've heard some people say they have had success with bio oil but I don't really buy it.  You could always give that a try though if you wanted to do something!  They fade overtime but the skin never fully repairs.
QYYWBrG7aa	I found out that i was having a boy at 16w3d and here`s my ultrasound picture there is no mistaking he`s a girl here.<br>  <a href="http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj224/UmHello_2008/itsaboy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj224...</a>|`|OiFNZnwOaa	i found out the sex of both my babies at 18wks, the earliest you can find out is 12wks but you have to have a very experienced technician as they are not looking for gentitals but at the way the pelvis is sloped you can look this up on the internet...some people find out at 16wks also...|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I went for my first ultrasound at 16 weeks and when we asked if they could see the sex they said yes. We found out it was a boy.<br>  Of course this was possible because the baby allowed us to see him, I guess it depends on the position of the baby too.|`|AA10015577	Depending on the technician, some can tell as early as 16 weeks but the routine ultrasound is done at roughly 20 weeks, when it's best to tell.  I just had an ultrasound today and it's a BOY!!!|`|LeY6hx4Laa	i had a scan with my first son at 19 weeks and found out he was a boy then! its soooo exciting! so maybe a week earlier then that would be fine to fine out x|`|qisy7yuSaa	from one pregnant ashley to another lol (my names ashley too) im just over 16 weeks, and im finding out the sex of my baby next week when i'll be 17 weeks, this is a private clinic that im attending and i had to pay ￡79 for the scan, but they pretty much gaurantee a correct result at anytime after 16 weeks, as long as the baby co-operates, and if not i can go back again for free! i hear people can find out at 13 weeks, but in a book i have it says at 16 weeks the genitals are formed outside and the sex can be determined by a good sonographer! so at 18 weeks you will defininatly be able to tell, so long as baby is co=operating lol!  good luck and congrats xxxx|`|D03NWG1Uaa	You can find out as early as 15-16 weeks, however, most doctors will not do it this early.  Most doctors do an ultrasound around 20 weeks to find out the sex.  However, my doctor is having me wait until 24 weeks.  I suppose the later you go the chances of it being more accurate due the baby's size.|`|1a4e762949cef21ae709d1393422411faa	Usually you just have a feeling of what its going to be.

JtbeH1Mgaa	Both of my sons got their first Power wheels at 1.  My oldest had one of the little 4 wheelers from Walmart.  Here is the link: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5079525" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  My youngest son had one of these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buzzillions.com/dz_1609674_boys_fisher_price_power_wheels_get_set_go_reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzillions.com/dz_1609674_bo...</a><br>  <br>  Both of them loved them and they didn't get hurt on them.  They don't go as fast as the bigger ones.  You can also buy some Power wheels that you can adjust the speed on or the ones with a remote so you can stop the vehicle if you think your child is in danger.  It just depends on the child though as each child is different.  They should never be used without adult supervision though.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yes, way way way too soon to make descions on his body being taken in an electronic toy and driving around.

Get shape sorters, and the likes, not toys with parts that choke and suffocate.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My friend bought her daughter one last Christmas. My son was 15 months old when he first got to ride on it and he loved it. All your child has to do is hang on and push a button to make it go. They are very small so it's easy for them to get on and off. I think it's a great idea for a birthday gift. Even if he can't use it right away, by this summer he will have lots of fun on it.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	My son has one of those small power wheels and he LOVES IT!! He pushes the button by himself when he wants too, but he loves it when we push the button and run behind him. He also loves to get on and off it and make driving noises he will even put his favorite stuffed toy on it and push it around giving it rides.  He got it as christmas gift and he had just turned 1 then. I say go for it...even if it takes him awhile to get used to it by summer he should be cruising like a pro!!  =0)|`|cHROCt3Aaa	I wasn't sure either and we waited until my daughter was 2 to buy her a Power Wheels. She really likes it. At one I don't think it would have been as easy. It takes a little bit of balance and coordination. Something that comes after they have been walking for a while.|`|o1hvya8zaa	My daughter got one for her fist birthday it only took her a few days to figure it out! Which surprised me but kids are smart! She's 16 months now and loves it!  If he doesn't get it at first it won't take long and it's great for the upcoming summer...|`|hSJnaysiaa	I think when they say 12-24 months they mean it'll fit that size of a child, not that the child is ready for the toy at 12 months necessarily. Powerwheels (especially the smaller dirtbike like ones) require balance to stay on, and most 1 year olds don't have that kind of coordination.<br>  <br>  That being said, you might have her buy it and he can use it when he is ready, whenever that may be. But think about the seasons too- here we definitely have winter, so he may not get much use out of it considering its only for up to size 24 months.<br>  <br>  The day we found out we were pregnant we went out and bought the Powerwheels Red Mustang (for ages 3-5). I'm not due until April, so it'll be quite a while (years) before he is ready for this toy (but to be honest we moreso bought it because I wanted it..he will enjoy it too though I'm sure) but its still fun to have.|`|wpo3zeVNaa	My 8 month old son has a power wheel and he LOVES it!  He got it as a Christmas present this year.  It is called the Tot Rod and we got it from Toys R Us.  What is cool about it is that it has a belt that straps him in and also a handle that hooks in the back for the parent to push it if he is unable to.  Then when he is able to do it on his own the handle can come out and there is a button on the steering wheel for him to press.

AA12068313	I think that's fine so long as she's not literally sitting in front of the tv all day.  If she's playing with her toys and such then I don't think its a big deal.  I do the same thing.  I watch the news a lot during the day, or just have it on while I'm doing chores and what not.  My daughter doesn't pay much attention to the tv unless its a kid's show.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i think this is fine as long as you not using the tv as a babysitter...backround is fine and her dancing along cant be all that bad:))) watching a small amount of tv wont hurt them!
9IFF0vIoaa	Start a different sleep schedule.  My oldest did this, too.  Get her up everyday at the same time...Then put her for a nap that is a specific amount of time...don't let her just wake up whenever.  Then bed time at a regular time again.  I would say that if she was up by 8 every day...she could be ready for a nap by 1 or so.  Then there is enough time after the nap to get her tired enough for sleep that night.|`|F4XaPnXHaa	Hi, it does sound like she wants to stay awake.  My daughter stopped napping through the day at about 18months old!  This was not great for a while but after a week or so she started sleeping a lot better at nights and was fine during the day.  When she was being fussy i started distracting her about 10 minutes before she would normally go down for a nap with something fun or slightly different to that that we would normally do (eg helping me make lunch, going for walk) and she would soon forget what she was fussing about.  Hope this helps, and good luck|`|AA11327039	It's a testing phase.  Write down when you want her to go down for nap, and keep her at somewhere near a 1 or 2 hour nap.  Make sure she goes down daily and turn off all media, tv dvd, computer, radio, etc.  No toys or anything during this two hours....to get the point across, you might have to lay down for a few days to show her it is sleeping time.....<br>  <br>  Of course for bed time, put her down at say....9pm and tell her she can't get out of bed until 7am (show her a clock and the hour part..put black tape over the rest)<br>  <br>  Just stick with it and eventually she'll stop testing you for awhile and things will calm down.....my daughter did this to me and she's now almost 4 and still naps daily and sleeps well at night.|`|9hggEdf1aa	Kids can nap up to 5 years.  Nap time for m was a time for me torelax ans unwind.  Try to keep a normal routine every day.  Take your daughter onto her bed and sing nursery rhymes, the alphabet song and numbers and then read a book and then tell ur child its nap time. IF she keeps on getting up then lie next to her until she sleeps
rUMGPXqwaa	no it doesnt mean you are. if you still havent got your period in a week, take another test.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yeah it's possible to get negative in the early stages of pregnancy if you don't have high levels of the pregnancy hormone. Take another one in a couple days or go into the doctor's for a blood test. Those are a lot more accurate.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I've honestly never seen one of those "early" tests work.

Birth control pills are 99.5 percent effective, it all depends on the pill that you choose to determine the side effects. <br>  They are composed of varying amounts of estrogen, combines with small amounts of progesterone. There are monophasic, which have fixed doses of estrogen and progesterone, Biphasic: constant amount of estrogen and increased progesterone, and triphasic, with varying levels of both. Side effects: Estrogen:possible nausea, breast tenderness, and headache, Progesterone:weight gain, depression,break through bleeding.

Some tests are deisgned to do a few days before your due on which sounds like the one you have done. It can also depend on your hormone HCG levels. You are probably better doing another test or getting a blood test.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|0Vmn3vnHaa	It does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. Same happened to me. Have you been stressed out lately? Are you underweight? Have lots on your mind? These are things that can screw up your cycle.

Could just be imbalances in your body.|`|JreuGwJYaa	I have personally took a test thats came back negative when I was pregnant I just had to wait longer. I've also taken tests that came out positve when I wasnt pregnant. A blood test would be a sure bet!
VHHis05Naa	I give her a timeout if there's somewhere clean for her to sit safely.  If not, we leave and she goes to her room for 3 minutes when we get home.  We make her ride in the front part of the cart and that really helps curb tantrums.  Also, we don't do HUGE shopping with her, because I think an hour or longer in the store is too much for a child her age.  Instead, one of us goes alone or we break it up into two shopping sessions.  That ends up being fine for us, since we can't get everything we need at one store anyway.<br>  <br>  Also, I've had the florist person watch our cart once while my daughter went potty, so you could probably do that for a time out as well.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	With my stepdaughter, I put something of hers back (her favorite thing is the Dora the Explorer yogurt and I put it back on the shelf if she starts acting up).

Make sure he understands this. Have him to repeat to you I will behave, listen and act right. Say if you do not as soon as we get home you will be in time out for it. Say do you want that? He will hopefully say NO. and not get an additude. Whenever you are out in public and he starts in acting up say Do you remember what I told you about how if you act up while were out as soon as you get home you will be in trouble? I would think pre-warning him enough letting him know you are serious about it would stop him from acting up. Good luck.|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Always grab something for your son when you get where your going when he starts to throw his fits tell him your going to put it back.

I run into the same problem. I agree with the other poster. Put something back. For example - when we go grocery shopping I pick up one of those fruit leathers. The all fruit kind. I hold it in my hand when we shop. If he's good he gets one. If he's not, it goes back. I try to use something I'd buy anyway, last summer I used strawberries.<br>  You could also implement a sticker chart. If he's good he gets a sticker and x amount of stickers adds up to a treat of your choice.
LZiDTLHOaa	You can take a progesterone only pill- just ask your doc.  Most oral contraceptives are a combo of estrogen and progesterone.  estrogen can stop milk production, so you will have to take the "mini-pill".  One thing to know:  Be sure to take this pill at the SAME TIME EVERY EVENING- because it is slighty less effective than the combo pill, and there are no "off" days, meaning you take an active pill every day.  Good luck with the breastfeeding!!  It is an amazing experience!|`|6fiYhtACaa	I know that you can take the mini-pill (progesterone only), however, most doctors don't recommend normal combination pills. They supposedly interfere with milk production. Plus, it's uncertain how much of the synthetic hormones get into your milk supply and the effect they will have on baby.
eV5E9MhUaa	Just depends... your hormones are acting up. Could clear up, it could stay. Good luck... :( sorry I couldn't tell you something better.|`|SeDiJ32Haa	Higher levels of hormones called androgens can prompt the sebaceous glands in your skin to get bigger and boost production of an oily substance called sebum. Cleanse your skin twice a day and moisturize. If you wear makeup, keep it light and with natural ingredients. Drink lots of water, which is good for both your pregnant body and your skin. Outside of that, there isn't much you can do. It's a pretty normal thing but there's no telling when it will go away. If it's so severe that you want to look into topical solutions, consider natural remedies as there are many chemical creams that have ingredients that can harm your baby. Just do your research if that is an option for you. Good luck.|`|mvuX24PJaa	not sure when it will go away, but, drinking plenty of water helped to keep my skin clear. It is there because of the changes in your hormones.|`|JreuGwJYaa	Thats a pregnancy symptom it should go away by the end of the 1st trimester.

sxecXFgraa	Most of it is what my doctor told me.<br>  1.  Mine were of the bottle by 1 year, but I see nothing wrong with letting a baby use a bottle a little longer.  <br>  2.  Heard this before, never listen to it.  My kids love milk (so do I) and we drink it all the time.<br>  3.  Didn't always put my kids in a highchair to drink and I let my kids sit in my lap sometimes to eat, especially if we were just having a snack.  We would feed each other.<br>  4.  Reducing fluid intake before bedtime reduces the amount of wetness that comes out during the night.  Starting this now will be good practice later when you start potty training.  I never put bottles or sippy cups in the bed with my child.  That just never sounded safe to me.|`|TQW5E6olaa	1. That's a parenting choice, my daughter didn't use sippy's 100% until 15 months<br>  2. I believe recommended milk is like 16-24 ounces a day and juice is no more than 6oz and those are suggestions. I could be wrong....<br>  3. That's a parenting choice. Putting a baby in a high chair when they're thirtsy sounds silly to me.<br>  4. Again a parenting choice. I don't do drinks in bed, but she can certainly have water if she's thirsty.|`|AA10494763	Yes that is standard practice for them to say but you know your child best<br>  My first was off the bottle at 11 months (she still had formula but in a cup we sarted working with sippy cups at 6 months old and she had no bottles by 11 months old)  but my next one has some developmental delays and may  not be because he may not be able to hold it on his own<br>  <br>  They get most of their nutrition from food at this age not formula so they don't need as much.  They drink like you drink to an extent but not full 8 oz glasses any yet<br>  <br>  As for the eating in the high chair it is to start good eating habits. They should be self feeding at this stage and or encouraging to self feed as much as possible.  you need to cut things up and give them finger food. It is part of their development to do it on their own.  it also teaches them there  is a place to eat not just anywhere you want <br>  <br>  as for just wanting something to drink i heard that too but i don't see an issue with let them walk around with a cup but they are unsteady at this age and can fall and break teeth with the cup in their mouth. In the highchair or seated is the safest untill walking/ corridintaion is better closer to 17 to 18 months<br>  <br>  5 is a BIG yes they should not of had bottles in the bed before. <br>       1.  it will rott their teeeth<br>        2.  they can choke with no supervisoin<br>       3  it starts bad habits bed rooms are not for eating <br>  <br>  over all i think you should be following these things not so rigid you know your child but for sure on number 5|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i dont think he needs to be in a high chair everytime he drinks <br>  ur not sitting at the tabel everytime u drink are u|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Sounds like that nutritionist is a little bit obsessive!<br>  <br>  You should aim to have him off th bottle by 12 months but if not, it won't kill him. My 2 year old still has a bottle for milk but has juice in a cup. He has a bottle of milk before bed, it helps him settle. But he has it in the living room and not in his bed. Stuff the highchair-yes it's easier but sometimes it's a LOT easier to have him on your knee! And that's no where near enough milk-double it and you're about right.<br>  <br>  Do what you feel is best for your child. The nutritionist is following 'guidelines' which generalise and don't take into account that every child is different. All 3 of my sons are totally different and it's like being a first time mum all over each time! Read a lot of the questions and stuff on herethere are a lot of very smart mums on here that have helped me no end!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Those are personal preference, but I do tend to gree with them.<br>  I have five children and I run a home daycare.    The one year old children in my care do not get bottles while at daycare and they do sit in a high chair every time they eat or drink.  They do get a sippy cup and I don't allow them to to walk around with it.<br>  When I take my Food Program training classes for my Childcare Provider licensing, which educates me on how and what to feed children at every age, I am taught that this is developmentally what a 12 month old child should be expected to do.  I follow these guidelines number one because I agree with them , but number two because I am required to.<br>  So like I said, I definitely think she was correct in the information she provided you, but like everything else, make the decision you feel is best for your baby.<br>  I do have lots of experience and  information I could share with you if you would like to contact me.  <br>  Good luck!!;-)|`|LMc23g9Maa	It sounds about right.  Teach him to eat at the table / high chair.  There is probably no need to make him drink while sitting though.<br>  Nothing but water before bed as anyhting else can cause early tooth decay. Of course you can give milk then brush teeth then have a sip of water to finish.|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, yeah that sounds about right... but just remember, take everything with a grain of salt from people like this.. Do what feels right to you and your child..not doing exactly what these people tell you to do will not make your child be in any danger, nor will it make you any kind of horrible mother!<br>  <br>  Edit: The nutritionists in my area are a bit over bearing as well!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	very strict...the first one is right ish but shouldnt be stressed as its a weaning process. the second is right they only need 400ml of milk but more is fine and the rest well thats her opinion and you can raise your child and feed him the way you want too:)|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i think they just want to make sure you don't let the child eat and drink laying down all the time, because it cause ear infection.|`|2n93DU71aa	You poor thing! Majority of all dr's say these things to new parents because of recent testing and personal opinions. If you want some honest advice I think that you should do what you feel comfortable doing. My son was 15 mo before he was off the bottle completely, he is now three and take a WATER cup to bed. The reason that most people don't like babies, toddlers, to be on the bottle much longer then a year is due to teeth development, thats why yes it is important that you only let them have water at night, formula sits in the mouth and it has a lot of sugar in it and even tho the little one doesn't have teeth yet, they can still be effected. As far as the high chair thing, for me I think it's nonsense! It is only nature to want to cuddle your little one as they are drinking a bottle. Maybe what the dr meant was as you are trying to transition him/her to regular food and family meals that it could be easier to only have meals at the table. The best advice that anyone could really give you is to remember that it is your child and you make the decisions and do what feels right for you and your little one. I hope that helps.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Yes, my son is also 12 months old and that is what the pediatricians are recommending.  I was told 16 oz of milk (whole) day and 4 oz or less of juice.  However, you use their suggestions as a guide only because every child is different.  He should not be using bottles anymore at all- that is an important one (you do not want to be the mom to the 2 year old with a bottle/binky in its mouth, right?)<br>  <br>  I let my son have his sippy cup in his playpen and also, he does drink milk right before he goes to bed.  He also wakes up in the middle of the night and then I give him water only (this is mainly so his teeth don't rot).  You can hold him when he is eating and drinking- I really don't see why that is a problem.<br>  <br>  Honestly, take all of these things into consideration, but really the only one that is an excellent idea in my opinion and should be done asap is the transition to a sippy cup.  No more bottles (or binkys either).  The other things you can do over the next few months.  If he wants milk before bed you can give it to him, and if he wants to drink more than they say he should have- what are you going to do not give it to him???  That's insane, of course you are going to let him have milk.<br>  <br>  Good luck, they told me all that jazz at my sons appt last week, too.  It is almost like they turn 1 and you are supposed to flip their world upside down!|`|SRsFkNBBaa	where in the world did you go?? none of this sounds right. when you say nutritionist, do you mean the heath department for wic? <br>  our health department for wic says as follows:<br>  <br>  you should start to WEAN at 1 year old. even the backs of the formula cans tell you that a child shouldn't have milk until at least a year old. so it doesn't make sense for them to tell you he should be completely off a nipple-but start weaning him. give him his bottle say only at nap & bedtime, and slowly take him off. at you & your babies own pace though!<br>  <br>  every baby is different, so them telling you what your baby should be eating, is ludicris. they might have a scale for the "normal" feedings for this age, but every baby differs from another-do what your baby needs.<br>  <br>  i have heard this phrase before. they want him to eat only in the highchair for choking reasons. (solids & such) as far as drinking, its best if you don't let your child run around with a sippy of juice constantly, if you do, they will want it more all the time, instead of designated times, and that gets out of control with sugar. as far as not holding your baby, forget it! that is your special bonding, time. you do what you feel is right.<br>  <br>  they say no sippys & bottles at bedtime, becuase of bottle-rot. if children are left with a bottle, at this age, they actual fall asleep (which im sure you know) with the nipple or mouthpiece in their mouth. the milk will slowly drip out and sit on the gums. i DO agree with this. i used to take care of 3 children (brothers & sisters) with baby bottle rot and its horribile and painful. the point is to remove the bottle when they are done sucking.if they fall asleep, use a pacifier if they want to suck, that way milk doesn't sit on the gums.<br>  <br>  all this varies, you do what you feel is right for your baby. it sounds to me that you just got a real exaggerated person for your nutritionist, is all. your first lesson in "its my baby, and ill make the decisions! " you go girl!!|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Things are different now than they used to be.  So I can only give you my opinion from when my kids were little.  They only ate dinner in their high chair.  Otherwise, it was at the table (they had a little table of their own with little chairs), or they free ranged it (ate while they played).  I do agree on the bottle -- it's time to start on cups.  I started my kids on the "no leak" sippy cups when they were about 1 year old before graduating to regular sippy cups.  I think more milk is needed, at least 16 ounces, and more juice (6 - 8 ounces or so) so long as it's pure fruit juice and not 10% juice.  The thing with milk, is it can fill their stomachs up so they're not hungry for real food.  So if you give them too much milk, they won't eat as much food.  I always gave a snack and milk about 30-45 minutes before bedtime, but nothing after bedtime unless it was a very small glass of water (so as to curtail the bathroom trips or wet diapers).  And I always made sure that even snacks were "healthy" and not just sweets or "fillers."  I didn't care if my kids free ranged it instead of having a formal "sit down" -- kids are so busy at that age that I figure it's best to get healthy food into them whenever you can.  I think the nutritionist is being a little harsh or hard ball, however you want to say it.  So long as the child is eating healthy, that should be all you care about.  Not whether he's in a high chair or not.   <br>  <br>  My kids are 16 and 9 now and healthy as horses.  And they eat just about everything that's put in front of them too.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  Remember to keep your child on whole milk, not skim or non-fat.  Young children need calories from fat for growth and brain development and whole milk is good for this.  At least until after they are 2 years old.|`|1tHVDSRJaa	I don't think she was a parent.<br>  It is good advice but needs to be relaxed. She doesn't know your child - you do. Don't put him in his high chair just for a quick drink, this can be a great cuddle time, with or without a nipple/sippy cup. Meal times yes, as it teaches them to sit still and complete the meal, but she sounds awfully regimented.<br>  Follow your Instincts and love and cherish your little boy|`|D8vOpNWgaa	they say no nipples after the child has teeth b/c they have tendencies of chewing the nipples and then swallowing the plastic of the nipple. i had to take my son off of nipples at 6 months because of this.  now i say let the kid drink as much as he wants to as long as it is not making him sick or not bad for him.  the hole high chair thing is to get him started for when he is older. if he gets used to setting on your lap its the habit of the mother to then feed them off there plate and then he get the habit of thinking he can eat off any ones plate. so it more of telling him he can only eat off his plate. i don't think he needs to be in the high chair for drinking. if he has teeth its best not to let him go to bed with milk or juice the sugar in it can rot his teeth and can do the same for teeth that are not in yet too. i would start brushing his teeth as soon as he wakes up.|`|G8VYD83maa	I'm also a young mother and I've never heard the whole high chair thing before in my life.  My son is now 3.   I'd find a family doctor that you can Truly trust and have open convo's with where she won't judge you on your age.  Look at some 30 year old mothers. I always say, it's not my age that makes the mother it's the love.  He's one years old, give him 1/2-1 year and he's going to be sitting on a big boy chair anyway.  Don't worry about the whole high chair thing.  I do have a little advice on that, get a small table and a small chair, I have the crayola colouring table and my son uses that for when he wants his drink or snacks.  You will find that now is the time to start teaching him that the table is for snack and drink time, because you will realize soon that having Cheerios and milk in the living room is going to make a big mess.  Don't worry about the little things on what you have to do.  The time will come and he will turn out just fine.  Give lots of hugs and kisses and he will grow up great.|`|ZxQak4GAaa	First of all, I would like to congratulate you for seeking other opinions. It has been my experience that health professionals do tend to force their own agendas onto us first time mummys and make us feel that their way is the only way things should be done.  I have found that usually if my gut instinct is saying that something just doesn't feel right, then I am usually doing the right thing in seeking alternative advice.  Go with what is right for your family (as long it is not harming your child). Most of all - research and ask lots of questions to find what advice you feel is ok to follow!<br>  <br>  1. 12 months old is only a target to aim for - I know of plenty of children who are WAY over 1 years old who still drink from a bottle.<br>  <br>  2. I'm not sure what this would be in ounces, but I was recently told from a Nurse that the latest research from Royal Children's Hospital (I live in Australia) states that children of this age are only recommended to have 400mls of milk nowadays. (It used to be 600mls).  I believe the reason for this is to try to combat childhood obeisity.  Personally, I don't think the amount of milk a child is drinking is the cause of obeisity, but what other types of unhealthy foods the parents are feeding their child and how much exercise they are encouraged to do.<br>  <br>  3. I have always had a rule that my children (now 20 months old) are always to be seated when eating or drinking, but not necessarily in the highchair.  I mainly have this rule because of safety (choking), and another reason is that it contains the mess to one area!  I feel that ALWAYS using the highchair should be the parents personal choice.<br>  <br>  4. Both my children are breastfed before bed and sometimes they also have some water from a sippy cup.  Definitely no bottles or sippy cups in the bed with them!  They may choke and also bad for their teeth if they fall asleep sucking on it.  So...I'm not really sure what her reason for no drinks before bed is, unless you are trying to toilet train your child (probably not yet though as he is only 1!)  in which case it is recommended you refrain from giving drinks up to 1/2 hour before bedtime to lessen the chance of them wetting the bed during the night.

ZX2so3twaa	do you know what happened to it that made it like that? <br>  that could help them fix it.<br>  it's probably just the battery though.
stcyknAgaa	Hello, <br>    I think you need to have a brief conversation with this so called "Amy" with the message of sorry. Maybe slip her an apology note or just simply walk up to her and say "I'm sorry". "Amy" will more than likely know what the apology is for. <br>    If not that, then say something like (revise if desired) "Hey, "Amy", I saw the questions, and I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd take it that way. I may have said or insinuated the wrong message, but I wanted to tell you sorry on my part if I offended you, but then again, you asking two questions about me also offended me. Why didn't you just talk to me about it?"<br>  <br>    You two are best friends and should for that reason have at least a reasonable amount of trust or patience with each other. She should have told you instead of talking about you on this site (I am quite new to this site so I think posting a question about you here is rude, but correct me if I am wrong, if this in fact is a site for advice also, as you may see if you hover your mouse over my picture man, you will see I am new and have a lot of discovering to do here at this site) and you should have thought out your words. Is she usually a sensitive person? <br>  It really depends on "Amy's" personality. How did you say it?  Your tone may have mislead her to believe that you meant it in a rude manner.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, <br>  B.W.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Are you wrong for writing this question about her?|`|qCuwW9f5aa	Your not necessarily over-reacting. Just talk to "amy" and apologize. Explain how you didnt realize you hurt her feelings and such. After all, you didnt. My friend and I usually joke around about that kind of thing too, but sometimes, either her or i end up feeling a little hurt, and the other doesnt realize it too, even though we are best friends. Just talk to her about it, and she probably posted the quesion(s) bc she is afraid to face you about it.|`|q7MQhS6baa	Just bloody well speak to her and ask.

The number of days between ovulation and the start of the next period is fairly consistent among all women. However, the opposite it not true. The number of days between the start of the period and the next ovulation varies quite a bit between women. It even varies from month to month for the same woman.<br>  <br>  Counting days of the cycle is by far the easiest and least technical of all of the methods for tracking ovulation. But, it is really a retrospective indicator. It can tell any woman when her last ovulation was. But, it works well as a predictor for the next ovulation in women whose cycles are very regular. If the woman has a regular cycle, then this method can work for her. For example, if she has a perfect 30-day cycle, she will ovulate on day 16 (30-14=16). Day 1 is the first day of her next period.<br>  <br>  Women with cycles that vary a bit in length, but are nevertheless roughly every 30 days or so can also get some utility from this method. She can record the first day of her period for 3 consecutive cycles. From this information, she can get a pretty good idea of the week when she will be ovulating the next month. Having sex at least every other day during that week is a good strategy, if she wants to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Women who frequently miss periods or have widely varying cycles will gain little information from this method. <br>  <br>  Basal Body Temperature<br>  <br>  Another way for a woman to know if she is ovulating is to keep a record of where she is in her menstrual cycle. The Basal Body Temperature test measures a change in temperature that occurs after ovulation, so it cannot predict when ovulation will occur in a given cycle. Yet by looking at records from a few cycles the test can reveal a pattern from which ovulation can be anticipated.<br>  <br>  The best way to record and monitor body temperature is with a chart. This provides a good visual basis for determining ovulation:<br>  <br>  a) Make sure that day one on the chart is the first day of menstruation<br>  b) Every morning, before getting out of bed or going to the bathroom, the woman should take her temperature. A regular thermometer can be used, but special basal body thermometers should be available at the pharmacy if the woman wishes to use one. The same thermometer should be used every time.<br>  <br>  c) Make note of any lack of sleep, drinking alcohol, fever, illness, or emotional stress. It is also helpful to describe the condition of any mucous or discharge.<br>  <br>  Just after ovulation, there should be a rise of approximately 0.4-0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (about 0.2 degrees Celsius). The day of ovulation there will be a slight rise. The following two days will climb progressively higher. The rise on the day of ovulation is not distinguishable from the normal ups and downs in the entire pre-ovulatory phase. It is only recognized in retrospect when it forms an upward line with the two days afterward. The post-ovulatory tempertures remain at this new, higher level, until menses when they drop and start the cycle over again. Again, it is only useful when a woman tracks several of her cycles and (if they are regular) she will be able to determine when she will ovulate. <br>  <br>  Cervical Mucous Monitoring<br>  <br>  Another method for determining when ovulation occurs is through the cervical mucous monitoring test. This is the only method that will not require looking back to the past few cycles to analyze. It is based on examining the mucous that is normally secreted from the cervix in order to determine where the woman is in her cycle. The consistency changes during the cycle due to hormonal fluctuations. The key to this test is that the woman will actually have to get a sample of her cervical secretions (from the outer lips of her external genitalia) and stretch it between 2 of her fingers (the thumb and index finger) to test for the consistency.<br>  <br>  Before Ovulation (low chance of pregnancy):The first few days following menstruation, there will be little or no discharge present. The woman should feel dryness around her vulva. During this time, she is usually not able to conceive.<br>  <br>  Approaching Ovulation (chance of pregnancy):The first discharge that does appear should be moist or sticky and should be white or cream in color. In the finger test, the mucous should break easily. She will only be able to pull her fingers about 1 cm apart before it breaks. During this transition time, first the mucous will become cloudy and slightly stretchy during the finger test (this means that it will still break before the fingers are stretched all the way). As time progresses, the mucous will become greater in volume.<br>  <br>  Right around ovulation (high chance of pregnancy): At this stage, mucous resembles egg whites. It is the thinnest, clearest and most abundant at this point in the cycle. Finger testing will allow the mucous to stretch quite a ways (several centimeters) before it breaks (if it breaks at all). ) The amount of this

He asks me if I am miserable and of course I huff and puff and say: Yes :(  He tells me he's sorry and of course tries to make me feel better.<br>  <br>  Put your feet up, drink lots of fluid (water is best), cut back on sodium (anything salt). I don't have swollen feet or hands, they are a little bigger than before but, my husband doesn't really see the difference. Maybe because I sit in the couch and only stands up to chase my 13 month old around, lol.|`|Px3bsqPraa	the reason they itch and are swollen is mostly cuz ur full of water... but youll sweat it all out a couple wks after u deliver...to make it alil easier till then, keep ur feet elevated above ur heart and drink lotsa water[the water will actually help flush the toxins and everything out]
gieEWY1Qaa	Okay honestly EVERY one will say something different even doctors. Most people will say wait till after the 1st trimester. But others do it through out the whole pregnancy. Just make sure your in a well ventilated area and it might be a good idea to have someone, friend or hair stylist do it for you, instead of doing it yourself. But it won't hurt the baby.

Some places have lots of little children and babies in foster care but not all end up for adoption. So if you go that route (which is very rewarding) it may only be short term so prepare yourself. You could look in phone book and call Children's Services to see what classes they offer for foster parents.

We count from the beginning of one period to the beginning of the next. Cycle day 1 is the first day of bleeding.

First, it is helpful if doctor and patient are talking about the same thing; for example, if a patient tells me her cycles are only 17 days, but she is counting from the end of one to the beginning of the next, and I assume she means from beginning of one to the beginning of the next, I may think there is something seriously wrong and begin doing a lot of tests; if she is having seven-day periods, her cycle length is really a normal 24 days (17 + 7). If a woman is trying to get pregnant, she must keep accurate track of her cycles in order to time intercourse appropriately (or, conversely, avoid intercourse if she is using the "rhythm method" -- to avoid pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  You count from the first day of bleeding for one period to the first day of bleeding for the next.|`|B3H7HIFGaa	well. you basically just look at the average number of days between for a few months. girls generally aren't regular until early 20s though, so dont freak if its not on time or if its early.|`|AA11079476	count from the last 21st to the first day of your next period your cycle is 29|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	if i counted right it was 34 days and i never heard of that.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Your cycle was 32 days long.  It starts Day 1, on the first day of your period.  So Jan 17th was Day 1, then you count to the day you got your next period, which was on day 32 (Feb 20) the length of your period doesn't mean anything in counting your cycle lengths.  Its the time in between them, and it may differ from month to month, some months it may be 30 days.

7F0zA7ARaa	Give her a time out make her sit in a certain spot for a certain length of time. If she does not do this make her feel like a baby say either you are going to sit there by your ownself or else i'm going to hold your hand and sit with you. DO NOT TALK TO HER THOUGH! She makes a mess make her clean up her mess. Say no you are not going to pee in the floor, and no i am not going to clean it up. YOU ARE. She's acting up trying to get attention. Put her in time out and IGNORE HER! Do not feed in and give her attention. I'm telling you that is why she is acting out. OH and do not threaten with if you do BLANK one more time your going to be punished. She will test you ever time if you say one more time. Punish her for anything she does. Yes it's hard work on the start but once she knows your serious she WILL NOT test you! And knows you are serious and mean what you say.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Tell the parents to come home.  Let them know you won't be able to sit for their daughter until she can behave.  I can guarantee any parent that has their night interrupted will be sure to get their kid under control.|`|OD3hxWxvaa	Tell her that if she does BLANK one more time, she will go in time out for BLANK minutes (depending on the thing she did). If she does do it again, put her in timeout and tell her WHY she is in time out. <br>  <br>  reward her when she does something good.... movie, treat, coloring, sticker, ect.
B9Yfgjcbaa	Well, with the possiblity of pregnancy, these symptoms go along with that.  Being exhausted, well you overwork yourself.  You are always cleaning, cooking, and you are the main caregiver of the babies.  You could still have anemia, that would explain some of it.  Pain in your left breast, maybe you should get that looked at, if you have a family history of breast cancer.  You could also be getting the flu, but that wouldn't explain the other thing.  That could be from stress remember.  Stress effects all areas of your life including your bodily functions.  Good luck and keep me updated.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	Go to the doctor, ask for a blood test including a full blood count.  Could be anaemia, could be a number of things.
gWiZAsfBaa	No, I would not allow someone to babysit my child if I have not been there before AND if I do not know them well enough. I have to see the place and make sure it's a safe and healthy environment for my son. <br>  <br>  My inlaw's house is really dirty, they have trash and leftover food laying around. I know they're nice people, but I'm still hesitant about letting them babysit my son. He's right at the age where he likes to pick up things and eat it. I don't want him picking up their garbage and eating it.<br>  <br>  I think you're making the right choice. If your bf's mother wants to babysit, she should do it at your place. Set some clear rules for her and make sure she follows them. It's your child, make that clear to her. Some mother's like to think that just because they've been through it before, they can treat other family member's babies like how they treated theirs.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Given her track record, I'd say you're perfectly within your rights not to let her watch him. He probably knows the situation, and you should not have to explain or justify yourself. Put your foot down and say no and if he needs it spelled out for him in black and white, do so - but if you don't feel right about it, don't compromise your son's safety, by any means. Some people, even family members, do not always make the best babysitters. So don't be afraid to say no.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	No freekin way i would let her near my child. Its your baby, you dont have to send him anywhere you dont want too!

I have never heard of one saying "invalid". That's just odd. <br>  <br>  Your "friend" needs to go to the doctor. If she is not pregnant, then she may be sick, in either case, she needs to find out, as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Also, tell your "friend" that when you are not taking birth control as it is intended it can also mess around with your hormones, as well as, LEAD TO PREGNANCY!|`|wVOaRoKvaa	Well if she losing her appitie then i don't really think so cuz normally ur always hungry...

I think you really like this boy and you have whats called "Puppy Love" with him, but if you want to loose your virginity to him, wait until you are 18, mature enough to handel it both physically and emotionally, and when you are 18 if you still feel this way for this guy, then yes....you probably are in love.

QFNvYVtyaa	When considering the cost of any artificial reproductive technology, it is important to understand that there are more than just financial considerations incurred. You also need to think about the emotional and physical costs involved. <br>  <br>  Financial Costs<br>  <br>  The average cost for one cycle of in vitro fertilization is around $12,400. Typically, this includes lab screenings for both parents, your ultrasound and other lab work, egg recovery, and embryo transfer. <br>  <br>  Ovulation drugs and other medications may be extra. Also, if you opt to freeze some of your unused embryos for future use there is additional cost for freezing and storing. Sperm freezing and storage is also an additional fee. <br>  <br>  Because there are so many possible fees involved, it is essential to get a breakdown of costs before electing this procedure so you don't have any surprises. Check with your insurance to see what fees they will cover, if any. The remaining costs may be financed by the clinic or other financing companies. <br>  <br>  Insurance<br>  <br>  Currently there are 14 states that require insurance to cover some part of in vitro fertilization procedures. This might simply cover your initial diagnosis or part of your treatment. Get a written statement of what is covered by your insurance so you are clear what your financial responsibilities are. <br>  <br>  These states require some form of coverage: <br>  <br>  Arkansas <br>  California <br>  Connecticut <br>  Hawaii <br>  Illinois <br>  Maryland <br>  Massachusetts <br>  Montana <br>  New Jersey <br>  New York <br>  Ohio <br>  Rhode Island <br>  Texas <br>  West Virginia <br>  Read more about state infertility laws at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine <br>  <br>  Financing<br>  <br>  Instead of racking up credit card bills that often have a very high interest rate, there are a few financing options available. Consult with the financial aid counselor at the fertility clinic that you plan to use so he or she can tell you what programs the office works with. In addition, there are two companies that offer financing for your in vitro fertilization procedure: <br>  <br>  Capital One Healthcare Finance <br>  First Again <br>  <br>  Emotional Costs<br>  <br>  Don't underestimate the emotional cost of in vitro fertilization. A couple who decides they must use this route to conceive a child is likely already stressed and anxious due to previous failures in conception. <br>  <br>  Counseling is recommended for couples who choose in vitro fertilization to attempt to conceive a baby. It will help in dealing with the stress and the flood of emotions that you may feel at this time. Feelings can range from excitement to fear anger and depression, especially if initial attempt are unsuccessful. <br>  <br>  Sometimes the emotional costs can be devastating. Feelings of failure and heartbreak for a woman who just can't seem to conceive can not only wreak havoc on her own health, but can cause problems in her marriage as well. <br>  <br>  [Physical Costs<br>  <br>  There is also a physical cost involved with in vitro fertilization. These may be relatively minor things like enduring a needle or bruising while undergoing certain procedures. <br>  <br>  Sometimes eggs need to be removed surgically, which is difficult on some people. Fertility drugs sometimes cause unpleasant side effects that you need to be aware of. There is even a chance of infection from any of the procedures you may go through. Discuss all possible physical side effects with your doctor so you can be prepared. <br>  <br>  Consider the Costs<br>  <br>  While in vitro fertilization offers hope to couples who are unable to have children, it is important to see clearly what is involved. Infertility can be devastating but assisted reproductive technology is not a quick fix and is not always successful. In fact, on average, only one woman for every five who go this route will achieve a successful pregnancy. For those who do, however, the risks and cost of in vitro fertilization are definitely worth the outcome|`|bJlSUVtNaa	I have no idea how that woman got IVF in her condition. I am in the midst of IVF and it is expensive. At the facility we are are using, if insurance does not cover fertility problems, IVF can be as much as $50,000 including all testing and blood work. Fortunately for us our insurance pays 90% which is rare.
Dd6y8YDfaa	I think it's normal to be jealous, you're only human. The way I see it you were probably thinking about settling down with him and maybe having a family with him yourself in the future, until you broke up. Now you're not sure what to think. <br>  <br>  It seems pretty clear from what he's said and done that he's not ready to settle down yet whether that's with you or with anyone else. Which is unfortunate for you and probably this child that he may or may not have fathered (children need stability).<br>  <br>  I think you need to take a step back from this and accept that he may not get back together with you and stay with you. Explain how you feel about him and what you want and say that you will wait for him but not forever, In the meantime have some fun. Relax. Who knows who you might meet in the meantime. You may meet Mr Right who's ready to settle down and to commit to you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|uuceuyRyaa	theres really not much you can do,<br>  <br>  talk to him, tell him he sould get a DNA test on the baby.<br>  <br>  if It's not his, maybe he'll stop talking to her again.<br>  <br>  If it's his and he stops talking to you,then it's his loss for bein a a**.<br>  <br>  No your not being selfish, it's a guy you love, and he's hangin around a girl that might be lien to him.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry|`|9IFF0vIoaa	First...don't shoot yourself.  ;)<br>  <br>  Second...once the baby is born, your boyfriend can request a paternity test.<br>  <br>  ...If seems like the relationship itself is a little volatile.  I would let it go for now...and see how you are by yourself.  I know more people that have met their spouses when they were NOT looking for love.  Just b/c this is your first love, doesn't mean it's going to be your last.  This is not the kind of drama you are going to want to deal with in another 5 or 10 or 15 years!|`|soFpywFcaa	well in my opinion that baby should come first and that fact that he is willing to take his responsibility seriously show that he is a man and you should except that and move on all you are thinking about is your self that baby did nothing to you and needs a father|`|W6S6WpsNaa	To much drama.  I would move on.|`|nluNSDI4aa	Well for one, don't you ever get suicidal over no guy. NEVER. And I can see were you are coming from and I understand..but even if that child is his, that doesn't necessarily mean that he will want to be with her. But he seems that he does want to take care of the child(if it is his) which is a good thing.They would have to test to see if the child is his, if it isn't, I doubt he would want to be withe her after lying but who knows. All you can really do is try to live your life. Becvaesue not everyone is here for a lifetime. Some people are only in your life for a season and just to teach you a lesson, and some(few) are here for a lifetime. You get hurt when you try to make the seasonal person a lifetime person. I know, I've gone through that plenty of times and so have other women. So please take my advice. Because he is not the only man, I know that is hard to hear when you are in love, but that's fact. Try being single for a bit, get your mind and life rite, and be independent. Do stuff for yourself. Don't ever show that you weak for a guy, because if they hurt you...just please. Take my advice. Also he doesn't sound right for you so try life by yourself for a bit. You don't deserve to be treated like that so have some respect and pride for your self mama. Hold your head up. Don't go looking for love, you get hurt that way. Let it come to you. And work on your trust issues because you are only hurting yourself. Pray all is well with you tho, and stay strong. :)|`|zATQaiwIaa	Im sorry to hear you have gotten your heart crushed .....<br>  <br>  But have some respect for yourself and move on!  This guy is obviously not "The one" so let him go and find a guy you can trust and have a decent relationship with.<br>  <br>  One piece of advise - when you do decide to move on - do not drag your trust issues with you.  Bc they will only bit you in the ***.|`|57LFRfqCaa	Stop allowing yourself to be treated this way.  Don't see him again and get on with your life.|`|A2G9foewaa	What his penis flavored with chocolate?  ditch the idiot come on|`|6EIhzsqoaa	Girl drop him. As much as you love him or want to be with him.  He is young, indecisive, and not appreciative of what he has.  I mean your lucky he hasn't given you a disease.  He's seems very selfish, and caught up with that girl & the other situation he is in. You need to find someone who is going to appreciate you for who and all that you are, and someone who can be there for you & focus on you. Move on.  As hard as it is, he isn't worth it.  2 years on & off?   Definitely not a chance.  I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years straight only 1 break up.  You are probably young, and still have many loves to experience in your lifetime.|`|JreuGwJYaa	Even though its hard you need to leave him. If he really loved you the way that you love him he would be with you and not making up excuses about why he can't be with you. Your just going to have to wait for the baby to be born to find out if its his and if it is he probably will want to be with her. Babys change a mans life drastically. Good Luck!
413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	yes but its very unlikley. you need to have semen inside your vagina, within your ovuation time,  because the semen needs to reach an egg. but also if you aren't in ovuation, semen can live inside you up to 5 days.. so get a test if you think you are pregnant...|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It has to get in at some point...so if the semen never got in the vagina no.  If you mean the penis didn't but there was a possibility of semen getting in then its possible but not probable.  If you are referring to the stupid and mythical "pull out" method...put it this way...I'd take a HPT soon.|`|pBNBWw05aa	yes|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	Yes, because sperm are designed to impregnate, that is there ultimate goal. So they will do whatever they can to achieve it!|`|oHsxp5weaa	Yes. Little sperm cells are like worms. They will find their way up. Go to the nearest pharmacy and buy a Plan B you should be fine.|`|Cxdxo393aa	yep.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes - sperm swim. <br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|THF5Da8Waa	If a single sperm gets inside of you and finds its way to your ovum you can most certainly get pregnant.

I can't stress to you enough how important it is to have someone there that knows what they are doing. Don't take the chance. That's great that you went to classes, but by asking what you can give her to reduce the pain shows you should not be doing this yourself.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	please call to have her receive some medical attention. paramedics and physicians are well equipped to deliver a baby; she runs the risk of bleeding to death, the baby could easily be choked by the umbilical cord (this happens often even in fully equipped hospitals with 3 doctors in the room), etc. although its tough to pay back a large medical bill, it is far better than losing your loved one to a situation that could have been prevented. i wont tell you when the birth will likely happen, because there is no way i will condone you delivering the baby yourself. also, shes 14- her risks are tripled. dont do something this stupid. it will end in tragedy. and dont let that moron above tell you adoption is horrible because the "poor thing will be out of place". a 14 year old child as a mother would make me feel pretty damn out of place, and since you are too financially strapped to even go to a free clinic, you cant afford to properly take care of this child.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	take her to the hospital, they will take her without health insurance.  she needs to have medical professionals to take care of her and the baby.  what if  something goes wrong?  you won't be prepared for that or know what to do..get help!|`|zoWGiIyNaa	ok, so this is happening and the first thing to go through your mind is<br>  "oh my gosh I'd better see what the people on Yahoo!

When we put him down when he is not wanting to go to bed he cries for a lil while we give it 5 mins and give him a binky kiss and let him go another 5 if he keeps this up a couple times I offer him another bottle, then lay him down and repeat. my son is 3 months old and sleeps for 7 hours at night on average with a few nights 5 hrs.
m8alP5kPaa	I'm not sure how you can check a childs IQ, but make sure you are giving him foods that have iron such as fish, beef, chicken, eggs, dry beans ect..<br>  Also make sure he is getting foods with Vitamin C such as Oranges, strawberries, brocolli, tomatoes, spinich ect.. as Vitamin C help your body absorb iron.|`|ho2hEqo8aa	I think it is a common problem for kids on cows milk. Did she suggest any diet changes? I would follow her recommendations. If not and he is eating solid food try some that are high in iron. Also iron is better absorbed when you eat in combo with other foods high in vitamin c. (I like orange juice and liverwurst) but most kids wont so find what works. WIC has great nutritional info for kids I think they should have a website a local office for you.<br>  As far as IQ it is a little early and I think it probably  would not be a problem unless child becomes extremely malnorished. You could contact your local Head Start or Early intervention office to have child tested. Doc might be able to refer you to similar office in your state or look in White Pages of your phone book.|`|532XA7lkaa	Never heard of it.

MILK is not causing the problem. LISTEN to your doc.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	It's not the milk, per say. It's the fact that your son is having milk instead of iron rich foods. He should be drinking milk in conjunction with eating iron-rich foods.900ml of milk per day is too much. He does not need more than 3 small glasses of cow's milk each day. <br>  Cut back on his milk intake and start giving him foods high in iron such as red meat, seafood, lentils, chickpeas, quinoa. Non-animal foods that contain iron need to be eaten with vitamin c (Orange juice) so that the iron is absorbed. You can't check your son's IQ at his age.

z6IekuwSaa	You can add more milk if you want to it at a later feeding. As long as the bottle is finished within 24 hours. I was always told that breastmilk can be left out at room temp for 4 hours. But the breastmilk storage bags I bought from Lanisohl or however you spell it says 10. Haven't tried that. What I usually do is stick it in the fridge and have her finish it at the next feeding before starting her on a fresh one. Don't throw it out though. No need. And you worked hard for that!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You can keep the leftover for the next feeding only.  Breastmilk contains antibodies which provide infection protection unlike formula.

However you should try to avoid heating it more than twice because heating can destroy nutrients and change the protein.  However that being said because of the risks from formula if you were faced with a choice between heating milk for a third time and formula the choice is breastmilk.

Bacterial Analysis of Refrigerated Human Milk Following Infant Feeding. May 1998.<br>  <br>      "Summary: The number of infants who are breastfed is on the rise, as is the number of women in the workforce. Many women who choose breastfeeding after returning to work, express milk during the day and store this milk for a future feeding. When infants do not finish a bottle of expressed breastmilk, doctors recommend unfinished portions be thrown away. This study examined bacterial levels in expressed, partially consumed breastmilk that was stored for 48 hours at 4-6° C. A portion of unconsumed milk was examined as a control. Samples were taken every 12 hours for bacterial analysis. Tests were performed to identify total colony counts, pathogenic Staphylococci, coliforms and b-hemolytic Streptococci. This study showed no significant difference between bottles that were partially consumed and those that were not exposed to the baby’s mouth for 5 out of 6 participants. All milk samples had colony counts in the acceptable range of < 105 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). Although this project provides evidence that it may be safe to refeed a child a bottle of breastmilk, due to the small sample size, further tests should be performed."<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issues-for-mom/the-case-for-the-virgin-gut-3451/3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issue...</a><br>  Just one bottle of formula - given for any reason - can sensitize babies who may be allergic to cow's milk protein or soy protein. This is especially important to know if you have allergies in your family. Some studies have indicated that giving cow's milk formuls early may also increase the risk of some children for developing insulin dependent diabetes.<br>  <br>  <br>  A breastfeeding mother I worked with recently found out that offering formula early can cause severe problems for some babies. She found this out the hard way. Her baby had early sucking problems and was given formula for a few days in the hospital. This mom worked hard to establish her breastfeeding and soon was successful. Things were going very well until she decided to go shopping one day and leave formula behind for her husband to feed her 6-week-old son. She was not concerned because he had already had formula and shown no adverse affects.<br>  <br>  When her husband fed her son, the baby began having severe reactions and was rushed to the hospital. Hospital staff did not think that the problems were related to the formula. This little guy was subjected to thousands of dollars in tests – all negative. He went home exclusively breastfeeding. A few weeks later when his daddy gave him another bottle of formula, he turned blue, almost stopped breathing and was once again rushed to the hospital. It was determined at last that he was allergic to formula. His allergies began with the early formula sensitization in the hospital nursery. Needless to say, he never go|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	I generally let my bottles stay out for 6 - 7 hours.

Talking in class in really the responsibility of the teacher to solve, not the parents at home. Ask her/him where your child sits, when he wants to talk the most and request that he be moved to a desk away from his friends (if necessary away from all the other students). I work in a school and just getting the child away from the temptation of talking to classmates stops the chatter immediately. Then sit your son down and tell him what the new arrangement is at school and let him know that once he learns to do his work on his own quietly he will be allowed to try sitting next to other students again.

I agree with other people when they say that it is often the teacher's responsibility to handle kids talking in class but this year has really shown me the limits that I have in dealing with this problem.  Because I did a good job with my class last year (this is my second year at the school but I'm the most experience teacher on my grade-level), I was given a class filled with the most "challenging" students.  They're not awful any of them but they come with a variety of challenging behaviors (largely a difficulty focusing in class, talking, difficulty refraining from calling out in class at inappropriate times).  They're also low academically, many of them.<br>  Here is how I'm limited at school in what I can do:  I am not allowed to take away recess or separate kids from their peers at school.  I can't offer candy or treats to reward good behavior.  It seems ridiculous to me that I would have to send a child to the principal for talking but I am almost at that point because I have tried all of my teacher-tricks in class and there are still some children who consistently miss instruction because they're talking.  (Doesn't sound like your kid---he'd be an angel in my class if he's only getting in trouble once a week for talking; I'm thinking of children that I'll have to reprimand twice in five minutes for talking during instruction.)   What's unfair is that they're causing other children to miss instruction too, both at the time it happens and when I have to manage their behavior.  A parent once explained that she felt her child would be best served by sitting with a group of quiet children; I had to explain that this would be in another classroom since I simply did not have enough consistently quiet children to go around.<br>  I liked the suggestion of emphasizing the positive and encouraging rewards for going a certain number of days without checks.  Ask the teacher if this is the norm for children to get a check a week---is it more or less than the other children in the room?  Is it occurring at a certain time of the day or with a particular child?

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Her parents are actually the ones whom can get in legal trouble.  She is a minor, and they are responsible for her care until ATLEAST the age of 18.  Kicking her out is neglect and child endangerment on their part.  With that in mind, I would think that her parents would not try to cause legal trouble for your family.<br>  <br>  As far as your situation, you need to look into the statutory laws for your state.  It varies greatly, but your being 18 and her being 17 might not be a crime in your state, especially if you had a relationship prior to your turning 18.  If you will post (or email me, via my profile) your state of residence, I can give you more information.<br>  <br>  Also, in cases such as this I always wonder if the parents are thinking logically when/if they press charges.  I mean, you are the father of their grandchild, and I assume the act of intercourse was consentual.  Is it really worth pressing charges against that person, especially when there is such a little age gap?  It is just starting your life as a family off on a bad note.<br>  <br>  Now, to play devil's advocate for a moment I will also say that her parents are probably in shock and disappointed.  Give them a little time to come around, and do not hold too much of a grudge once they do.  You will understand one day-especially if you have a daughter.<br>  <br>  I wish your family-including your extended inlaws-the very best.|`|xc6iCPUQaa	I agree with Kay and BraxOwl!!|`|BBfIXcI0aa	That's a sticky situation. Your parents can get in trouble if they try to keep her parents from getting to her. However, if her parents kicked her out and they know where she is, and they aren't trying to get her to come back home, then you're probably fine.|`|frpCK0utaa	i doubt it. If anything, they'd get in trouble for  throwing their daughter out, as she is still a minor. They are legally responsible for her.<br>  <br>  And you wouldnt get in trouble either, shes 17, almost 18, theres not a huge difference in your ages.|`|029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	Well what they did was very illegal, so if they call the police, they are just asking for trouble. That's neglectful and it's abandonment. People go to prison for that kind of stuff.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Her dad can get arrested for kicking her out since she's under the age of 18 years old.<br>  <br>  Take her in and if he calls the cops, tell them the whole story how he left his minor daughter on the streets.|`|q7MQhS6baa	No, because as a minor her parents have a legal responsibility to look after her. By kicking her out, they've broken the law. Your parents won't be doing illegal in giving her a home.|`|DvriP0Xvaa	i dont think they can get arrested <br>  besides they kick her out so why would they <br>  do that is just dumb if they would do that|`|FEXnrx1taa	no, but if DOR finds out, they will take her, and her parents could have a problem.|`|8DhRxcF7aa	i don't think your parents would get arrested because they're just trying to keep her off the streets

I always thought that using an absorbent and tough paper towel would be just about the same.
r7tWe5dqaa	It COULD be but only if your baby is REALLY sensitive to medication. My firstborn is. And the doctor's never warned me that that might be the case when the put me o medication just after her birth. But I was also on several medications. Some of them much stronger than Tylenol. So where it is possible it is not overly likely. But if you are worried about it then you should stop taking it and see if it changes your babies behavior.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Acetaminophen doesn't cause drowsiness, even when given directly to the baby.<br>  <br>  Also only a small percentage of mom's dosage gets to baby, its unlikely it would have any effect.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Prob not. I called the breastfeeding helpline that the gov has set up. They told me reg strength tylenol doesn't effect babies. Maybe your baby is just going through a growth spurt. Somedays my girl will just take frequent half hour naps and others she'll sleep a couple hours at a time. If she has a fever or seems fussy call your doc
yGabEjDMaa	Yes, I have.  With my first miscarriage.  Took them 2 weeks, then they decided to do something about it, other than just drawing blood.

I miscarried once as well and had to have a D&C done. I know how frustrating it can be to have the blood drawn, but wait it out if you can to avoid the procedure. It can scar your uterus complicating a potential future pregnancy. You most likely won't have too much longer to go. Best of luck.|`|JreuGwJYaa	I had two misscarriages and the hcg levels went down by their selves and I've never heard of them not but for one of mine I started bleeding then went to the hospital and it took over three weeks for me to actually misscarry.

The only thing you can do really is try to find a reason... for us it was an allergy to cow milk protein.  I was nursing so I cut dairy out of my diet and it improved.  You may want to try a new formula if you formula feed or do an elimination diet if you breastfeed.  Good luck and hang in there!! It does get better!!|`|WBHJ4Py9aa	omg poor u i feel for u been through it my baby screamed bludy murder evry single night from 5pm until sometimes 1am only way to cal her down get her to sleep was to either take her for a drive or wrap up warm and stand outside house when it was dark and peaceful and she would just look at the sky and after however long sometimes shorter than others fall asleep.  i tried everything infacol gripe medicated stuff nothing ever worked she stopped when she was about 5 months ish!! they say its sometimes if they have a traumatic birth mine was horrid forceps after 4 days of regular contractions good luck just stay calm and when ur at your tether pass her onto someone calm to settle her

z6IekuwSaa	Absolutely! Rent a hospital grade pump and start pumping 8-12 times a day for 20 min at a time. Then when your milk comes in use a supplemental nursing system. So your baby can nurse from you and get the expressed milk too, increasing your supply. Also contact an LC to help you. It is Very possible.I've seen it done, and it is worth it!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relactation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relact...</a><br>  Relactation or induced lactation (for those who did not give birth to their baby) is essentially a two-fold process:<br>  <br>     1. You will be teaching (or re-teaching) baby to nurse at the breast, and to equate nursing with comfort. If you're having problems getting baby to nurse, see Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse!<br>     2. At the same time you will be developing (or re-developing) a milk supply. Developing a milk supply requires nipple stimulation (via baby nursing, hand expression, pumping or a combination) and milk removal (once there is milk to remove). If your baby will nurse, regular and frequent nursing sessions (even if baby is just learning in the beginning) will be very helpful.<br>  <br>  If your baby is 4 months old or younger it will generally be easier to relactate. It will also be easier if your milk supply was well established (frequent and effective nursing and/or pumping) during the first 4-6 weeks postpartum. However, moms with older babies, moms who did not establish a good milk supply in the beginning, and adoptive moms who have never breastfed can also get good results. Keep in mind that breastfeeding is not just about the milk. Your child will get numerous benefits from breastfeeding even if you do not have a full milk supply.<br>  <br>  If baby is willing to latch on, then nurse often (at least every 2-3 hours). Also, offer baby the breast for comfort any time you see a chance- at the end of a feeding when he is not hungry, when he is going to sleep and just waking up, and whenever he needs to comfort suck. Even if baby is not getting any milk at first, the nursing will be signaling your breasts to make milk. <br>  <br>  <br>  NEWMAN-GOLDFARB PROTOCOLS FOR INDUCED LACTATION<br>  <a href="http://www.asklenore.info/breastfeeding/induced_lactation/gn_protocols.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asklenore.info/breastfeeding/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  How to Induce Lactation - the Well May Not Be Dry!<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/157409/how_to_induce_lactation_the_well_may.html?cat=25" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Induced Lactation<br>  Breastfeeding your adopted child<br>  <a href="http://www.babyzone.com/baby/feeding_nutrition/breastfeeding/article/induced-lactation" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyzone.com/baby/feeding_nut...</a>|`|KtCE991Vaa	PUMP!!

Some people kept calling him Gavin, which was not so bad as he wasn't even born yet, but I kept going back and forth and my mother in law was pressuring me to just pick one, so finally I said I was not deciding until I signed the birth certificate and that I had the RIGHT to change his name as many times and at any time that I wanted!<br>  <br>  If you are trying to decide if you want to tell your family, I say keep it a secret, it's more fun that way!<br>  <br>  By the way, his name is Gabriel!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Yes.|`|iMULlxdgaa	well...yes and no...but my husband spilled the beans and told my dad we were naming the baby after him (his middle name)  I wanted to kind of surprise him when he came to the hospital..but regardless, I made my dad smile so, it's all good!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I did. I can't keep big stuff like that a secret! Our parents loved our daughter's name, Kayleigh Miriam.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Yes.  I named my daughter after my Mom's Mom so I told the whole family!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yep|`|IU4uNH97aa	For our first we didn't find out the gender so we told people our options but we never told them which one was certain for the baby. We had atleast 3 names for each gender so no one knew for sure.<br>  <br>  For our second we told only my the family about the name but it didn't feel as special when everyone met him because we went on about him and when he was born they already knew everything !<br>  <br>  With the third we decided not to tell anyone because we chose to keep the gender and name a secret. We were told he was a girl at first then a boy later because he kept moving and changing position so thats why we didn't tell people the gender. We had chose names for both genders but we knew it was going to end up a boy. Eventually people found out what his name was but we changed it. They all thought he was going to be Jack Milo but he is Jude Michael Rivers , they were really surprised !<br>  <br>  With our forth we didn't find out the genders so same thing with our first baby. <br>  <br>  With this baby we found out the gender but aren't telling anyone about anything.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	We didn't tell anyone because we weren't 100% sure on a name until after she was born.  That was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made!  I hated every girl's name...but finally we settled on Kaitlyn Alyssa and it fits her perfectly!  Everyone thought we were just saying we didn't have a name picked out, but we really didn't :)|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Yes and I never will do that again. Next time...if there is a next time...I am keeping it a secret. I got WAY to many opinions of how "you should name him this instead".|`|y999LLxdaa	Yeah i did and to my surprize i chose a name that my mom wanted to name me when i was born.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Nope, we didn't tell anyone until she was born.|`|EeGgovyCaa	yes and my mom was the only one who didn't like them. Oh well, my kids, my choice.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Yes|`|LWXRVO5Haa	We did, but we kept her middle name a secret.|`|5Np8w5MCaa	Yes we did.  My first had her name the day I found out I was having a girl so we told both my parents and my husbands parents.  Our second daughter went through many different names and we didn't have her name picked out until a few days before she was born.  Every time we thought of a new name both sets of grandparents were told.  We loved having there input in the whole thing.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Nope. The only people that knew were me and the hubby. We went through so many different names. And everytime I mentioned a name we  were just "thinking" about someone had something negative to say...as if they had a right to name our child. So we finally picked one, and they found out when she was born and the papers were filled out. That way, they couldn't whine or try and change our minds.|`|r1KS5GsDaa	i always had just one name in mind for my daughter but whenever anyone would ask me i was say i was undecided and not tell them the one i had picked out cus i didnt wanna get them too attached to that one name and then change my mind. i made my mind up laying in the hospital bed. hahaha.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	When I get pregnant (hopefully this month), and I find out the gender, I will tell them! I don't know if I will tell everyone, but definitely my parents!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes i tell everybody her name is Brooklyn Marie : ) <br>  if someone doesn't like it then tough ti-tty because she's not yours and we can name her what we want lol|`|LZiDTLHOaa	no- I didn't and won't tell anybody.  I don't find others' opinions useful, or nice!!|`|elx4NP4xaa	I did. I wanted everyone to know.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	We told EVERYONE her name before she was born!|`|uHwIz8U3aa	yes we did.

Enlargement of the breasts, which may be associated with secretion of milk (so-called "witch's milk"), often is transient but may last longer in breastfed infants. In one large-scale study of 984 examinations of 640 healthy infants from birth to two months of age, galactorrhea was found in 45 examinations (4.6 percent) of 38 infants (5.9 percent).15<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3946357" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39463...</a><br>  For a five month period, infants examined on admission and discharge from the newborn nursery and at two-week and two-month well-baby visits were examined for breast nodule size and the presence of galactorrhea. Nine hundred eighty-four examinations were performed on 640 children. Forty-five examinations (4.6%) on 38 infants revealed galactorrhea. "Witch's milk" was noted at all ages studied, including 1.8% of examinations at 2 months of age. All the infants with galactorrhea were born at term, with neither sex predominating. Children with galactorrhea had breast nodules significantly larger than those of children without galactorrhea. None of these infants was hypothyroid. This study concludes that witch's milk is a common occurrence, associated with larger than average breast nodules, and may persist until 2 months of age in normal newborns.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0022-3476/PIIS0022347605005822.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://download.journals.elsevierhealth....</a><br>  ‘‘Witch’s milk,’’ associated with larger than average<br>  breast nodules, is a common occurrence in neonates of either<br>  sex and may sometimes persist until 2 months of age.1,2<br>  Maternally transferred estrogens and secondary hyperprolactinemia<br>  are responsible for this physiologic phenomenon.<br>  Continuous manual expression can result in production of<br>  milk over several months.2,3 Beliefs that ‘‘if milk is not repeatedly<br>  expressed, witches would suckle infant’s breasts and<br>  leave their curse or mark’’ or ‘‘daily expression from 7 days to 7<br>  weeks of life or until breasts dry ensures good shape of breasts<br>  at the age of marriage’’ result in this unhealthy practice still<br>  followed in many cultures across the world.4,5 Management of<br>  this condition requires only ‘‘observation but no interference.’’|`|n3PE2lvDaa	yes it is normal. It is just because her hormones have been passed on to him when she was pregnant. The milk will disappear on its own in a few weeks. Just leave it be and keep an eye on it. If it looks red and infected take baby to doctor but it should be fine. just let it dry up on its own.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	Ok if a small child is having bleeding like a period is not good unless she is close to menstrual age... thats a sign of being molested|`|KtCE991Vaa	Its totally normal!! All of the moms hormones are clearin out of babys system.. it will pass..|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	yes it is normal,and do you know how to type?  seriously i couldn't hardly understand your added info.  it's all due to hormones, as soon as the hormones he had while he was in his mother's body leave, he will stop producing milk. it is completely normal.<br>  <br>  and no bleeding isn't a sign of being molested in a baby girl, it's due to the same thing, hormones,   EVANS HERE YAY!!! WHAT A BIG GUY.  fyi|`|U2N5kQmlaa	About a year the baby can. If the baby starts drinking milk to early the baby can become lacktose intolerant|`|PbBWJGsTaa	Yes it's normal.

qxnZXOVFaa	i got married march 12, 2005.  had my twin girls June 5, 2008.  no DNA test.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I am married, Yes, of course we'd like a healthy child...but we will love her either way, no...we did not do any DNA testing, including the multipule tests that hospitals offer to detect abnormalities because we didn't want to have to sit and ponder on things if it turns out she did have some sort of disorder.
145RUNQHaa	Staying calm and gentle is a must if you retaliate in any way then you may aswell be a toddler yourself and it ends up like two nursery children fighting and not parent and child.as a parent your number one job is to set a good example that is the only true way to parent and any parent who knows what they are doing knows that.when he bites you need to just distract him away from it so he stops biting just point at something and chat to him and while you are chatting just point to where he bit you and tell him it hurts and can he kiss it better this is a lesson in empathy.if he does kiss be sure to praise him.toddlers biting is normal they nearly all do it for various reasons frustration,teething or some toddlers believe they are showing affection.if it's frustration then work on noticing signs of when he might get worked up and re directing him before he has chance to bite.if he does it while you hug him it's more of a physical thing it's kind of a kiss but they are not old enough to understand it hurts sometimes they are learning about cause and effect but either way i would just distract him and the less deal you make out of it the more it will just be something that will pass.just keep on being a good role model take the time to teach him how to be gentle by being gentle yourself and above all laugh together.xx|`|J2glFOkhaa	bite him back, show him it hurts. <br>  <br>  If not pop him in the mouth, enough times and he won't want to bite anymore<br>  <br>  and calm down people, I said pop, not punch.. there is nothing wrong with a pop in the mouth if the kid bites. lucky for me my son never in his life opened his mouth to bite anyone, that would drive me insane, i can't stand that in kids|`|SnoKfIKOaa	Ok... This sounds WAY out there, but it worked on my daughter, after trying EVERYthing else and what the health visitor said!!!<br>  One day she hit me (after months of hitting and biting) and a thought went through my mind of what would happen if she did it when she started nursery... I imagined any child SCREAMING... so tthat'swhat I did. I screamed and pretended to cry, like a 3 year old. She only ever did it 3 more times, and now we are smack and bite free....|`|RGIkYercaa	knock his/her's teeth out!! <br>  <br>  na joking.<br>  <br>  ask one of those midwives, child experts|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	You are gonna have to bite him back.  You do not have to bite him so hard that you break the skin but hard enough that he knows that it hurts.  He will then stop if you keep biting him every time he bites someone.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	well my good old nanna used to say that the only way to stop it is to bite them back but i never tried it xx|`|DVX8UVKOaa	I have a 20 month old. Although he can't always express himself verbally, he can understand what I say to him. You must tell him firmly NO and explain that it hurts and that he mustn't do it. I would also perhaps take your attention away from him after you have said no. (toddlers want your attention more than anything) This should make him associate biting with him then losing your attention. I would not bite him back. This will give him the message that it is ok to bite because Mummy bites.|`|3QkVoT2kaa	My son was a biter and would regularly get into biting competitions with other children in nursery!  I found the best way to handle it was to make it clear that it was not acceptable without making too much of a deal of it, but biting back, hitting or shouting is giving him the attention for wrong reasons.  Praise him when he is being good and he will eventually realise that bad behaviour will mean he will be ignored.|`|BG0z9rYOaa	Cannot quite believe any of the answers previously given.  S/he is a baby who really doesn't quite understand what they are doing.  My son was the ultimate biter, it is purely a stage all be it a very sore stage they are going through.  I squealed when he bit me and pretended to cry.  Id walk away without giving any eye contact for a few minutes (mainly to calm yourself) and then distract by handing than an interesting toy or whatever to get their mind of what had happened. It will pass if you continue with the same reaction.  Please remember s/he will have no idea of the pain involved or that this is not a behaviour that you wish to continue.|`|9645a46e70a83bbe9fcc4c24cfef735baa	Bite him or her back very hard, just like dogs do on the ear<br>  it shows you are the boss, he or she has to be shown it is not nice, <br>  be hard to be nice, it is the only way, sorry but you have to,|`|mRzTIZYBaa	i know this is mean but stick a Kleenex in its mouth...it will never do it again....|`|BDarMnDeaa	Give him/her a time out, or give him/her a spanking!
Ccq8zEcnaa	Spotting could be due to implantation bleeding, or could be from the pills. Also it could be because you quit taking your regular birth control and your body is just reacting to it. I would go get a blood test done from your doctor. But then again it may be kind of too soon to tell. Maybe wait a few more weeks, to see if your period starts. If not then take a test. You are having some of the symptoms of early pregnancy, but then again these symptoms are also related to pms and from irregularity with birth control.|`|fPVz671zaa	YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO TO YOUR DOCTOR. TO GET A PREGNANCY TEST. THAT IS THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU. YOU WILL FIND OUT RIGHT THEN AND THERE|`|PeOCqztoaa	I would say the spotting is most likely from the morning after pill. I had that problem a few years ago when I had to take it.|`|hY5JSbRBaa	You could be pregnant. The leg cramps are concerning. Be safe and go to the doctor.
juU6nJqUaa	Aftyer you go off the pill, it normally takes several months for your cycle to get back to normal.  You could just be re-adjusting.<br>  <br>  You could be pregnant, but normally if you have any kind of period at all ,then you are not.<br>  <br>  Be patient, try not to stress about it.  Just give your body a chance to get it's own hormones running again.|`|AA11079476	it may take longer but yes|`|aHWmqYY2aa	could be but also could be your body adjusting, take another test. good luck|`|eDmdkUO3aa	yes|`|KPKd8dzNaa	Go to the store & get a pregnancy test.  That's how you will know for sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
pjGhLLEdaa	Of course a 5-year-old would rather live with his grandparents!  While he's with you, it's like being on vacation for him.  He gets pampered and showered with attention.  He doesn't have to go to school, etc, etc...<br>  <br>  My siblings and I bawled every time we had to leave our grandparents' home.  It would take our parent literally hours to get us out!<br>  <br>  No worries, he'll grow out of it.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, of course there's always that unlikely and unthinkable chance that there is indeed another reason why he does not want to go home.  Abuse maybe?  I'm not saying it's the parents.  But maybe a babysitter?  Or a friend of the parents?  Or, maybe he just gets bullied by the neighbor kids?<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  .|`|VHHis05Naa	I'm wondering if you "spoil" him at your house and don't enforce the same rules Mom and Dad do?  That's what my MIL does and of course my daughter wants to stay there longer...|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	kis love there g/parents   ,,  they all say that    no worries there|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	Is sounds pretty normal. Grandparents tend to spoil grand-kids and the parents are ones who have to disciple the kids when they act up.<br>  <br>  In his head he knows that when he is with you he is only going to have fun but with the parents he might get in trouble for not doing chores or getting a bad grade etc. <br>  <br>  However if his reaction is very strong then in a casual way see if you can get him to tell you about any problems he sees. Make sure he does not have odd bruises. See if he says anything about the parents fighting with each other. Or one parent hitting the other etc.
Fy9S6hjIaa	I've giving my son 1% milk ever since we switched from formula at 12 months.  His Dr. said it really wan't necessary for children to drink whole milk.  He said even skim is fine.  So I would say go for it.  If the 2% still bothers his tummy you might try 1%.  Also introduce it slowly.  Just start with a couple oz. a day.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	If the milk is already bothering your son's stomach, you will need to watch it, no matter what form of milk you are using. One thing you can do is to give your son some yogurt, and also find a source of probiotics to help him develop the enzymes in his digestive tract, which help digest the ingredients in the milk. Try, also to cut down on sugary products and avoid white flour products. A sensitivity to milk or other foods can cause more than an upset stomach. They can also cause rashes, chronic ear or throat infections, innattention problems, and other things. Try probiotics.|`|rOFteEdlaa	i would really ask your doctor just to be sure but i dont see why he should be able to be on 2% milk, my twins were about that age when they went on 2%|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Talk to your doctor first.

I think Rhyler is cute too.<br>  I love Ryder and Rhyder too though.<br>  Kids don't make fun of other kid's names often, if your kid gets man fun of, it will be b/c he is short or wears glasses or has braces or is really tall, or something to do with his looks. Kids will jump at chances like that to make fun of other kids, but not names so much, Ryder is such a common name now that it would be dumb for kids to make fun of it anyways, b/c it's so widely used. And any name can be turned into something to make fun of, so don't let that turn you away from a name.<br>  <br>  Anyhoo, I really love Ryler!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I prefer Ryder.  Ryler just sounds funny.

UgIOVl1jaa	I have the same problem but we have acreage & it's alot of work, I don't use any poisons around the lawns as we have horses & even my dogs eat the odd blade of grass & I don't want them to get sick.  You can use boiling water or vinegar as a natural herbicide which is cheaper & better for the environment.  Also, pulling weeds by hand can be good squatting practice!

Your mother should get into *some* of your business, because you're a teenager, and parents worry about their teens, but what she's doing goes too far. The thing with the police isn't SO bad; she could have been worried. The stuff with her butting in on the telephone call, and reading your letters is just TOO far.

But if I had to choose from the 2 you selected I would go with nose it would look ALOT better then an eyebrow.|`|e999e7de922e3571d326c032bb6fda4aaa	i'm not sure about it. you look so preppy or normal - like everyone else i know. it would look a bit weird. but if anything, go with nose. and if you don't want the pain then why get one?|`|otinl2ucaa	you dont wear alotta makeup. i wear that much. it just makes your eyes POP! (:<br>  &i think you would look really cute with your nose pierced.|`|58eHufb3aa	I say both.<br>  You'd look supergorgeous with your eyebrow pierced.<br>  i dont think nose would hurt.<br>  It'd be like an ear cartilage piercing|`|sT19s1l2aa	take those links off you dont want sketches like us looking at them <br>  <br>  <br>  do it<br>  <br>  <br>  NOWW|`|vAlnbDU3aa	i think both a nose piercing[[sc]] would luk good on u
ktiLKNNeaa	yeh i love that name my mom's cousins daughters name is <br>  <br>  Tori Kay Seriano|`|cErLq7f3aa	Torey Kay is cuter|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't think it flows. What about Victoria Kay? You can still call her Tori.|`|be40588ae7c28e63b468da0087e4f8f9aa	I like it a lot.<br>  One of the names on our short list for our daughter was Tori Lynn.|`|W0nd3qF3aa	I Love the name Tori soooo much not so much Kay though|`|xoTzDLJ2aa	Yeah, I think Tori is pretty.|`|X77Kzh7baa	yeah...it's kinda odd but it grows on you....<br>  <br>  i actually like kinda like it....|`|6Nq3HKjYaa	yeah its cute, pretty short tho, it'd be better with a longer middle name
ZX2so3twaa	i think he'll become a distant memory soon.<br>  just try to think about your boyfriend instead and the fun times you have with him.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I think you should steer clear away from this other guy. You've got a fantastic boyfriend who is willing to give you what you deserve. You don't want some idiotic person ruining it for you because you have 'leftover' feelings for him. Think about you & your boyfriend, and try to forget about the past you and this guy experienced.|`|3w7VztEWaa	what you need is closure.<br>  Maybe if you can go back to Washington and see him. <br>  See how he feels about you know.<br>  You don't want to end your relationship you have now.<br>  but you don't want to lead him on to a tragic heart break on his part.<br>  <br>  <br>  mmm by the way I love washington. I was born there.<br>  Best state ever..GO COFFEE ha<br>  I miss being there.|`|6EIhzsqoaa	Girl you are in a different state.  Get over it and be thankful for what you have now.  Of course you're always going to remember your first "love or crush" but it's just memories that bring back those feelings.  That other guy is probably in love with some other chick by now.|`|ba7a9d89b85e1c8a26e92c2727576399aa	ive been in the same boat before girl. i have a bf and i met this guy at a friends house before i started goin out with my bf. but i still think about him and i told him that is still liked him but he didnt feel the same way. and i fell kinda hard for him night that we met he said he liked me but nothin ever happened. but me and that guy we are friends and talk some still. he eventually will just become a memory and youll forget about him.|`|u0eTvggDaa	You have to make your self happy, before you can make anyone else happy.<br>  <br>  It's not like your living back in Washington right now, so i mean even if you did break up with your boyfriend that you're with now, you would still see him around i am sure.<br>  <br>  But i mean when you do go back to Washington, you will just have to make the choice then.<br>  <br>  I think if you're not moving back,and you're just going to visit closure would be the best thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and hope i helped somehow! <br>  <br>  :)
AA11296427	Evolution.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a 8 year old niece who has a cell phone. Only because she stays in school longer, and her mom just calls her to ask if everything is ok.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|vp1K0bxwaa	I don't have an iPhone, and I'm 17.<br>  <br>  I have a cheap, crappy prepaid phone.|`|mgTZD9Teaa	Well I got the iphone for my 15th birthday, and don't you dare say i'm spoiled.  I work extremely hard throughout both the calendar and academic year.  I maintain all A's in my classes getting excellent report cards from my teachers and I have a job which I work very hard at.  So excuse me if my parents feel they need to reward me.|`|Iv8WwN2gaa	my daughter has one.she told that it's all in one.first she liked my blackberry but didn't wanna copy me. so for her birthday i got her the iphone. i know that when it goes out i will have to get something else for her.|`|jV8GTDnqaa	Iphone is in style.  Once it dies, no one will have it anymore.|`|otinl2ucaa	my four year old cousin has an iPhone.|`|TQoB76FDaa	Im 14 and have an iphone and i had to work hard for it and no my parents arnt spoiling me at all i have to do chores and get good grades to keep my phone.  Yes, some kids i know like my 8 year old niece has one which is a bit over the top but once the iphone goes out of style kids that can afford it will find a new craze.|`|GzpkA8HFaa	They probably don't realize it yet. I believe spoiling never really does the person good in the end. Those kids will be broke and unappreciative in adulthood. I admit though...I splurged and bought myself and= IPhone...it's the greatest thing ever and I fully appreciate it, and know I earned it.
Pf9fyEyQaa	I know a guy names Roman and he is a really strong, athletic, and yet sweet guy!  I've never heard it for a girl, but it doesn't bother me.  Makes me think of a strong, beautiful, warm-hearted girl!<br>  <br>  I think that Roman paired with a really feminine middle name will sound the best!<br>  <br>  Roman Mikayla<br>  Roman Amanda<br>  Roman Melissa<br>  Roman Amelia<br>  <br>  I think the names that end with A pair up best with Roman.  My advice would be to go online and look for names you like that end with an A.  Good luck!|`|JGpirCtLaa	Roman Grace<br>  Roman Brooke<br>  Roman Sophia/Sophie<br>  Roman Gabrielle<br>  Roman Isabella/Isabelle - I like this<br>  Roman Avery<br>  Roman Kendyll/Kendalynn<br>  Roman Olivia|`|cErLq7f3aa	Roman Claire<br>  Roman Blake<br>  Roman Lena<br>  Roman Marie<br>  Roman Chase<br>  Roman Elisabeth<br>  Roman Cora<br>  Roman Danielle<br>  Roman Alexandra<br>  Roman Jane<br>  Roman Noella|`|9EdUCTwjaa	i really like the name...the reason why i'm actually answering (duh)... bot since its kind of unisex, you should go with something a little more femine for the middle name. Some that i like are:<br>  <br>  Roman Nicolette<br>  Roman Anna<br>  Roman Jessaleen<br>  Roman Renee<br>  Roman Teagen<br>  Roman Katrina (my fav)<br>  Roman Darcie<br>  <br>  I like sasha-but iagree, it just doesn't go...|`|bnG26yIWaa	Roman Noel<br>  Roman Michelle<br>  Roman Sophie<br>  Roman Zoe<br>  Roman Karina|`|1SGhenQBaa	Roman Isabella and i luv the name Roman btw|`|4hQ5xpSTaa	Nicole<br>  Camille<br>  Lynnette<br>  Elise<br>  Brianne<br>  Lorraine<br>  Charlene<br>  Justine<br>  Janae<br>  Lucille|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Elizabeth|`|Uw5L1PdMaa	Candel|`|BRT2teSqaa	Roman is a boy's name.

Anyway, i recommend <a href="http://behindthename.com" rel="nofollow">http://behindthename.com</a> it says a lot about meaning of names. You can view tons of them :)|`|QVJ0CwNtaa	I like Roman. I have a friend who we all call Roman even though her name is actually a flower but it just... suits her. <br>  <br>  I really like Roman Isabella, now that is cute. I like the sound of a longer middle name, as you said, and I also think ones ending in an 'a' sound go well. Some suggestions for you are Roman Deliliah, Roman Lilianna, Roman Amelia, Roman Isadora, Roman Angelica and Roman Gabriella.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Roman & Italia<br>  Roman & Alexandra "Romy & Sasha"

ZbnxGIsnaa	Unless you are trying to conceive, technically this is in the wrong section dear.  Not too many people will be able to help you, BUT. . .<br>  <br>  I do have thyroid problems myself.  Hypothyroidism to be exact.  <br>  <br>  Sound like you have hyper thyroidism rather then hypothyroidism?  Atleast to my knowledge.  Women with hyperthyroidism have more periods that are heavier and women with hypothyroidism don't have periods.  Like I did.  Well, my suggestion is for you to contact your doctor and tell them what's going on and see if your dose needs to be lowered or highered.  That's probably the problem dear.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!!!!
w2kofruFaa	I HEAR YOU! Although I'm not pregnant with my ex's baby, and I know I should thank the Lord every day for that, I can relate to how you're feeling because of the breakup in general and how he ignores you like there wasn't ever anything between you...<br>  <br>  I really don't know the answer to your question because I'm still trying to figure that out myself. But I do know that crying and letting your emotions out really does help, to certain extent anyway, and allowing your friends to be there can really help, too. You could also look up quotes on the computer. I know it sounds stupid, but it did help me a little bit.. and listen to music. Blast it! However, you do need to realize that he'll always be a part of your life somehow. After all, he is the father of your child, but someone will eventually come and sweep you off your feet.. If he left you just because he knocked you up, he's obviously not that great of a guy to begin with, and I'm sure you don't want a douchebag playing too big of a role in your child's life.<br>  <br>  As for other's calling you a sl_t and a wh_re, don't worry about them. If they don't have anything better to do than make your life harder than it already is, they obviously aren't mature enough and surely couldn't take responsibilites for their actions like you are.<br>  <br>  By the way, I think you might want to check out this site: <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com</a> It has a lot of statistics and advice on health, relationships, pregnancy, and many other things. Make an account and check it out. You can ask question there, too, and get answer from people who know the fact. (Be aware, though, you may have to wait a few hours to a day to get a response.. But it's free, and you can always search the site and find the answers yourself.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9E91O09caa	It's going to take time. Especially him being the father of the baby. You're always going to have a connection to him. Hopefully, he's just being immature and will clear his head and try to make things work. He clearly is just a boy because a man would stand up and take responsibilities for his actions and be there for you. I'm sorry you have to go through this. It'll just take time, someone that appreciates you and your child will come along and you'll forget all about your ex. I'm proof.|`|rMgnmMN9aa	First of all, the fact that he left you after he found out you were carrying his child should help you to get over him. That in itself is horrible! You don't want to be with a man that won't support you through a time like this! You need someone reliable to help you to raise this child. It's hard but trust me for your baby's sake it's better without him. Good Luck hun.|`|ied3Ww49aa	Tough situation but it's going to be ok. My husband n I have separated and i am 8 months pregnant w/our daughter and we have a 15 month old son already. I miss his so so much nd think about him every day but my strength comes from my kids. I know it hurts but keep ur head up! You don't realize it now but i bet u r a strong young lady. i am only 22...about to have two kids under 2 yrs of age..divorced nd he is out living life like I don't exist. @ first I would have done anything to get him back but now...i do what I must for my kids and myself. Occupy yourself..be w/ ur girlfriends...family...prepare for your little one who is going to need you so so much! Right now it may feel like you are the one who has lost...but in the end....it's going to be him if he doesn't change. just know that the best thing about the future is that is comes one day at a time. Don't be so hard on yourself...smile! You are a mommy...the best thing in the world...you deserve to smile! <br>  <br>  E mail me if you wanna talk =)|`|ZX2so3twaa	how old are you?<br>  he might have just freaked out at the thought of being a dad and didn't wanna deal with everything.

g21dTqnZaa	As a mother of 3. We go thru a variety of emotions.  But when you get to your 9 month, you will want the baby out of you no matter what . The fear you have will turn into wanting to have the baby in your arms and see what he or she looks like.  All your worries will be gone and replace by love.  Good luck and don't believe all these comment on this page some of these people are idiots .  Also child birth classes can help you a lot.|`|PbESvbu6aa	hell yeah its scarey|`|KqxQlPrNaa	Of course!!!!  I used to be a nurse that taught birthing classes and I am also a Mom of 4.  I would tell my patients not to be afraid of the actual birth because that is just a day in  your life.  I would also tell them the thing to be afraid of was actually RAISING the kid!  The birth is the easy part in comparison.  It can also be the most lovely experience of your life so just embrace it and enjoy!  You are lucky to have family support.  Let them be there with you.  It will ease your fears and help you all to bond by being there to see the baby enter the world.  They will be more apt to help you raise the child having experienced the birth with you.  Good luck to you!  DON'T WORRY!!!  You will do great!|`|AA11208683	well im due April 12th and im scared too. its a perfectly normal feeling especially when you are pregnant. i get worried about every little thing. and its really good that you have your family behind you that will help you as well. especially having your mom there. she has already went through it and she knows. just remember to keep calm and breath nice and deep during labor. and remember that the pain will eventually end and you will have a beautiful baby that you brought into the world. i hope every thing goes well... GOOD LUCK!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I thought I would be and the fear of child birth was the first thing that came to mind and made my stomach jump when I first read my positive test.<br>  By the time I had been through 9 gruelling months of pregnancy I was glad when my contractions started (1 week late) I thought "oh thank god about time"<br>  It was my first pregnancy and the midwife never left my side, It will be the same for you too. I felt completely safe once I got to hospital.|`|ied3Ww49aa	of course it's scary but just start planning how you want your birth experience to be. Do you want an epidural? Who will make you feel most comfortable in the room with you? Ask the hospital if they allow you to bring ur own movies in into your birthing room. (most rooms have tv's with dvd players...I brought in my season of "Friends" and it helped me get through my 19 hours of labor) It will hurt...it's a hard task but soooo worth it. Once your little one is out...that whole experience is behind you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|tlu9wlNAaa	i was petrified! but the babies gotta come out sometime and when he did it was amazing! hes 13 months now and i still look at him like wow your my baby! good luck hun youll be fine and you have lots of people there for you which is good i had moved to canada from the uk with my boyfriend when i was 8 months pregnant and it was just us! and i was still fine lol xx|`|55aEucN7aa	Yes i gave birth to kyles before....<br>  I was afraid he wouldn't except him...<br>  <br>  AND ALSO IT RARELY HAPPENS IF YOU DIE OF CHILD BIRTH Yours will be just like everyone elses: alittle Painfull then rewarding....|`|VdnAH78Xaa	hey<br>  don't worry! everything will be fine.<br>  i wasnt scared, i was just really excited. <br>  its the most amazing experience, you will love it.|`|ekodPvCEaa	I was very scared at first, but once you go through the labor pains you forget all about it once you see your bundle of joy!|`|u4jmt2Scaa	yeah, but the second you acually hold that baby, everything goes away and thats all you care about ?<br>  <br>  goooodd luuuckkk!|`|1h5RpINNaa	I was literally terrified|`|Llt5PTN8aa	I think all women go through various intense emotions, good luck and congratulations!|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	i was very scared too|`|OF7ZHq19aa	I was scared of the pain and streching. I was right about the pain it hurt like b.... but then I got and epadural and the pain went away like magic|`|Z29oDYdWaa	Yes|`|F2vhgKUHaa	The best thing you can do for yourself is to educate yourself on exactly what is going to happen. It might scare you more now, but when the day comes you will be so much better off than if you hadn't. Knowing what is ahead of you and preparing yourself for it will allow you to make better decisions, but if you are uninformed and terrified EVERYTHING about it will be harder.|`|znlnIPTyaa	Yes my one child almost killed be but he didnt i am so cared to hav another child thats why i adapted 2|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Yep, I was scared.  Oh, intellectually, I knew that everything would be fine.  Thousands of babies are being born every day.  Women have been doing this since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  But...  *I* had never done it before, so, no matter how much I researched & learned from other people, I had no idea, really, how it would feel or how I would feel about it. <br>  <br>  Heck, I was nervous with my second birth, too.  Who knew if it would be anything like the first???<br>  <br>  One thing for sure, though, that baby is coming out eventually.  It can't stay in there.  And, you will get through it just fine.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I was scared, and then I had to have a c-section, it all worked out.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I haven't had my baby yet but I wanted to answer too if that's okay :)<br>  <br>  I'm due March 10th which is really close (I'm 38 weeks and 2 days along).  I am so terrified and excited at the same time it is crazy!  I am also really young (18...which is an adult where I live but it's still young!)  My mom will be coming into the room with me along with the baby's father.  I'm super scared about going into labour without knowing it, my water breaking somewhere bad (such as my mom's white couch haha), being in labour for a long time, pushing for a long time, tearing really badly, having a big baby (I was 9lbs 1oz), and I'm also scared about something being wrong with the baby (everything looks good but you never know right?)<br>  <br>  But then I think about the fact I will have the cute little boy to show for it after and it doesn't seem so bad.  I am so excited to have him here and in my life.  Although it seems really scary (taking care of another life and being responsible for another person) I feel as though I am ready to take on the challenge.<br>  <br>  Overall, I'm ready for this pregnancy adventure to be over and the parenting adventure to begin.  I can't wait for my little boy to make his debut!  Good luck with the pregnancy!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Every mom is afraid no matter what her age! Don't worry - you're in good hands. We just had our third child two months ago and I'm 30 and even though I knew what to expect I got scared anyway. But don't worry - you'll feel a little scared but more than anything you'll be excited. It's a big day for you and it's totally normal to feel scared, nervous, or even terrified. You'll be fine! Congrats!|`|G2auAv1Saa	I was shaking in my boots terrified. <br>  <br>  - I made it through wonderfully with a 3 hour natural vaginal delivery to have my daughter and I am going to do it again very soon having my son! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope i was fine . Just assume the best . Dont freak or be scared just enjoy the moment <br>  ignore buddy i have how dies in america form child birth ! hang in honey|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I was afraid every single time I went into labor. I couldnt help but think what if something goes wrong?, what if I cant do this?, and every other what if that you could imagine. Its perfectly natural to be scared especially your first time. Now I cant promise that nothing goes wrong but I can tell you that chances are greater that everything will be fine. When you go into labor your body know what to do and your mom and sister will be there to help keep you calm.....Researching what is bothering you may help calm you also...ie if you are worried about the labor, read some articles about it on line...if you are worried about not having what you need search for items needed for a new born.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped|`|1tmX7xbRaa	omg! yes i was afraid. i mean seriously you hear good stories and bad stories and all kinds of crap about labor and in the back of your head you know that every labor is different so of course you are like 'whats going to happen to me' and believe me when people tell you 'oh you'll forget all about the pain of labor once the baby comes' ... it's a load of bull! please don't misunderstand i LOVE my kids with all my heart and i would NEVER go back to change how i had them or anything but it's still not something that you just forget. <br>  all you have to remember is that once you are actually going through labor you will be so busy with everything else that is going on that you won't have time to freak out. just relax and breath because no matter what happens when that baby comes out in the end it will be the BEST moment of your whole life!|`|ud8jzRdNaa	i was 18 when i had my daughter i remember people asking if i was nervous but i can honestly say i wasn't know this sounds stupid but i didn't really think about it and once i was in labor i didn't have time to think you just have to get on with it it was painful but i did it all with just gas and air and a shot of pethidine but if you really nervous you could speak to your midwife about having an epidural im pregnant again 33 weeks and im more nervous this this prob because i know what to expect this time lol hope i helped good luck and i hope you have happy healthy baby xxx|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I'm due May 18th and so far nope im not scared. i think as time gets closer i will be more anxious and excited but i don't have scared ... yet. don't worry you got a while, we both do : ) it'll be fine.|`|Plq0BGSgaa	i wasnt terrified at all! until i was fully dilated and about to push<br>  <br>  then i got really really scared.<br>  <br>  <br>  everything will be fine, love<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|BO28Mn8haa	just remember to ask for an epidural. it's scary but you get through it. i was in the room with my cousin and she had a pretty easy pregnancy that little girl popped right out!|`|un8qNuQNaa	I am a guy and I was afraid.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	No..I was 17..it didn't hit me until the week I was due and I actually had a smooth labor.

0vLU2GGGaa	not my child, but my niece.  She didn't starts talking until almost 4 years old, she went to speech therapy and was diagnosis with developmental delay.  Her doctor suggested to my cousin (the girl's mother) that she can't fit in normal school and need to go to school for special needs.  My cousin didn't do that and insist on sending my niece to normal school, she turns out fine, better than fine, she is one of the top student in her school and a straight A student now.|`|MXMGd0Xaaa	im dyslexic and im just fine and dandy. i cant spell. but hell my gpa has never been lower than a 4.2 in high school so far. nd i can read super fast...and actually do better in english that ppl in my class. lol|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my hubbys uncle girl was suppost to have downs . she doesnt
kBp9IzQqaa	100%  You should be eligible.  You sound great.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Sounds like you would be approved.  Granted you've only been married a little while, but if you have been in a "stable" relationship with him for a few years (usually 2 - 5) they'll consider that as well. It's also easier to get approved if you go through the foster system.|`|Jime0cdqaa	do you have the children now? Are you already they're foster parents? If not are their current foster parents interested in adopting them? I answered your other question too. Your chances are good from what you've said but it really depends on many factors regarding the kids.|`|6L9jJnchaa	You sound like you'll be fine. =)|`|OQnRP6xVaa	It may depend on the adoption plan. If this is a private adoption (meaning the parents have agreed to have you adopt the children) then it is up to them and as long as you pass the home study, and background check then it's up to the attorney's and parents to work out the details.<br>  <br>  If these are little boys who are currently in foster care things may be a bit more difficult. If you either of you are relatives then there would be consideration about that relationship.<br>  <br>  If these are little boys you just know are legally free to be adopted from information in the community--or some kind of photo listing then you would be dealing with the state DHS and need to qualify under their rules.<br>  <br>  Most states require that married people are married at least 2 years before placing non-related children for an adoption. And if it the case these are boys you know need to be adopted and have not already gone through training and had your home study completed then the odds are you won't be able to accomplish all of that anytime before you have been married 2 years and it's likely these little boys will be placed before you could accomplish this.<br>  <br>  If you have been identified as a family member or a previously important person in their lives--the system may be more willing to work with you and speed things up for an Identified placement.<br>  <br>  There isn't really enough information in your Question to give you any concrete idea and the best recommendation I have is to speak with the attorney or case worker in charge of the arrangements being made for the children. Little boys this young will not likely sit in foster care for very long.|`|8BRdSzoaaa	IMe and my wife have just adopt one in March and are get ready to adopt a little gril.

jRSXE7BTaa	No. Generally yes, if the pill failed on its own. If you missed a few pills though, you could still ovulate later or earlier than the 14th day mark, depending on when you missed them.|`|xiCQj8YTaa	pretty much but your hormones fluctuate all the time so its always around the time give or take a day either side|`|6MLqrB3faa	yes ma'm|`|mTSYemNgaa	If you're on the pill, then you don't ovulate. If you did, you'd get pregnant.|`|PbESvbu6aa	yup
LTD0qL6Yaa	I went off the pill in early January as we wanted to TTC. I have always had a 28 day cycle (especially being on the pill). After i had missed 5 pills i had a period  (withdrawal bleed) from stopping the pills. That was on the 17th January so i calculated 14 days from then which gave me an ovulation date of the 31st. We baby danced before during and after that date and then waited to see. When i was only still  brown spotting on my period date (14th Feb) i told myself i would test in 2 days if it hadn't changed. I tested at 16 DPO and got a BFP. Your lutheral phase should be 14 days after the start of your period. This is the 2nd time i have stopped the pill and got pregnant on the first try in the same month. I am now 5 weeks +6 days. I hope this helped..|`|2f6diQBiaa	You don't ovulate on the pill. The pill stops ovulation. The "period" you get is anovulatory withdrawal bleeding from the progesterone that is contained in the pill.<br>  <br>  A woman not on the pill will ovulate 12-16 days prior to her next period (so, if you have a non-pill natural cycle of 28 days it would be around day 12-16).<br>  <br>  ADDED: Ah...OK. Yes, if the birth control failed, you can ovulate anytime during that cycle. Given that there is no way to pinpoint, I would trust the ultrasound.|`|roe07rI8aa	Not for sure, no. everybody is different and every cycle can be different. but round that time, yes. But if you're on the pill, of course you probably won't be ovulating at all.|`|vACNWfeWaa	That's a myth that most women ovulate on the 14th day (even if you do have a normal 28-day cycle).  It actually varies from 1 day before or after each month.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Well, if you're on the pill, you are more than likely not ovulating. Even if you are ovulating, that still doesn't mean you will do so on the 14 th day. While that is average, its not the rule. I don't usually ovulate till the 15th day even though I have a 28 day cycle.
AA11296427	That's not real popularity. That's a poser, trying to be what she really isn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean, have you ever noticed that these type of girls are the ones everybody hates? The real popular girls are the nice ones, who hang with everybody. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|1ASc1Is7aa	ugh who cares. I don't even think there are "popular" people in my school. I have heard there are but I sure haven't noticed nor do I even care.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Don't generalize. Some popular girls are ugly, but "regular" girls can be ugly too. Some popular girls are gorgeous, and nice. One of my friends is popular because she's sweet to everyone. There are popular girls that make fun of me because they're stupid and can't dance.

MwakNF9Vaa	My fav was the gerber birdseye pre-fold you can get them anywhere babies r us target Walmart any where. I used the snappi to keep it closed and then I used the Imse Vimse organic cotton diaper cover never had any leaks and my son was a big wetter. He's 15 months old and that's what I love to use even still. He has a 1 month old brother I use the same kind with him just the smaller sizes. Also with the gerber diapers if one gets really gross you can throw it out because they are so cheap they come up to about $1 for each maybe even less. If you can get an organic bleach to wash them I did the organic bleach every week or soo. Also don't use a lot of soap with these diapers when you wash them they don't need to be loaded with soap to get clean I washed then with ALL free and clear. Oh I should say I do 1 disposable diaper per night for my 15 month old because he sleeps a good 12 hours and no cloth diaper would hold that long he would wake up wet all over. But I just buy 1 case of diapers for him at night and it lasts almost 4 months. Also he's 1/2 way potty trained now which I am super happy about I think cloth helps him potty train faster.|`|hSJnaysiaa	I am pregnant and am going to be using Bumgenius 3.0's. These grow with your baby, so no need to buy a new size everytime the baby grows (thus the diapers last longer and saving money in the long run). They do make white ones, but we haven't bought white (just blue, green, yellow). They do require an insert, but the insert is not disposable like that of the G DIapers if that's what you're referring to, its a washable/reusable insert. Inserts are good, in my opinion, because you can take them out to wash which means the diaper dries much quicker than an all-in-one diaper. The Bumgenius diapers are $17.95/each which considering they can be used from birth to potty training with no up-sizing needed, isn't a bad price.<br>  <br>  We also bought one Happy Heiny diaper to try out (basically the same design as the Bumgenius but a different brand, these also come in white) and we bought about 5 or 6 Blueberry Minkees, which I'm not sure if they come in white or not, they are more cutesy diapers (and more expensive at almost $33 each) but again, no up-sizing needed. And these ones use snaps rather than velcro.<br>  <br>  All these diapers have pretty good online reviews as far as being user-friendly, earth friendly and durable goes.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would recommend Bummis Super Whisper Wrap Diaper Cover: Small (8.5-15lbs)<br>  <br>  A state of the art Aplix-closing (industrial velcro) cover has an innovative overlap design that ensures a custom fit on any baby. Made from a super resistant waterproof laminate sandwiched between two layers of a soft polyester knit. Made to withstand even the rigors of industrial washing and drying. A durable, heavy-duty elastic around legs and tummy which will not wear out with repeated industrial washes. Elastic is encased in soft, smooth polyester knit bindings for a comfortable, stretchy fit, and a leakproof seal. The generous cut of this cover makes it suitable for prefold diapers or fitted diapers. Machine wash and dry at normal temperatures. Avoid chlorine bleach or any other whitening agents.<br>  <br>  Here below you will find its picture and other styles of cloth diapers for your further consideration.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/cheap-cloth-diaper-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/cheap-cloth-dia...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	So you wouldn't consider the g Diapers?

HQf3QPUMaa	Yes yes yes!  Bi**hes I tell you, we're all a bunch of bit**es!  Oh come on, let's all admit that we're a little more outspoken on here than we are in real life,  that's why we all like it.  Otherwise we would be out in the general public handing out our opinions instead of the anonymity of our own homes. <br>  But-<br>  I never attack someone for what they do, how they parent, etc.  Why do I care what you feed your child?  You're not feeding it to my child and as long as it's not endangering them, then so what.  Same goes for diapers, going to work, etc.  You're not hurting your child so while I may give my opinion, I never criticize.<br>  <br>  You know what I say when people act like real *******?  -Piss off-.  Try it next time, it makes ya feel better ;)  And honestly, if someone came at me in real life the way some of these people come at us on Y!A, that would be my exact response.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I think the major 'judging' that sometimes goes on around here, is nonsense... One day, my God will judge me, and that is all. Others can only nitpick, and not *truly* judge.<br>  <br>  I agree; if you're doing what you have to do, then good for you! Not everyone does, and *that* is what is shameful!<br>  <br>  In real life, I am actually very similar to how I am on here... I don't usually get on my soapbox here, although I have certainly disagreed with others... I tend to *get* thumbs downs, at times, not give them... Why? Because some people can't handle differing opinions! It really is ridiculous... I would understand if what I was saying was utter trash, or downright mean, but for my *opinion*, which someone else doesn't have to agree with? Pffft! <br>  <br>  Sorry, but you reminded me what tends to be the worst part of Yahoo Answers! At least, in my humble opinion. ;)|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Take your rant else where.  Breastfeeding moms hear just as much BS as formula feeding moms. Moms who co-sleep or feed their baby table food from the get go hear a lot of BS.  ALL moms get judged and you just have to let it roll off your back.  Getting all worked up over some hate mail isn't going to change anything.|`|nbSp469Waa	I act the same way on here that I do in real life.  I'm not a faker or hide behind some screen name.  I would never go up to anyone and tell them not to buy disposal diapers or formula, cause if I did I'd be a hypocrite, since I use disposal diapers (I do buy the Earth's Best brand, waaayyy cheaper than Pampers and good for the environment) and I feed my 6 month old formula.

However, in real life, people in the store don't ask me questions about what they are buying, or if they should be doing something else.  On Y/A, people do ask questions about their choices.  I try to give my honest opinion, and really try not to be too harsh, but when you put a question out there to millions of people, chances are you will get some answers you don't like.  Why people send you nasty e-mails, I don't know.  Just block them!  Good luck.  Hope the rest of your day goes better.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Hey look on the bright side, it's just the internet. You can block them or not read their messages and answers. Try having to work with someone like that. I can't turn her off. She's constantly spewing nastiness at work about my parenting. How I need to take my daughter off my boobs because it's making her too clingy. I need to stop letting her co-sleep that's what cribs are for. I shouldn't pick her up when she cries. A first b-day if not a reason to take the day off. She's going to take her dogs b-day off next year if I get to take my daughter's b-day off. It goes on and on. <br>  <br>  To answer your question. I am the same as far my views on parenting. Whatever works! I NEVER confront anyone about their parenting styles here or off the internet. I'm a little more reserved in real life. The only difference is on Y!A I tend to talk more since I'm more shy in real life. Sorry your having a bad week. I am also. I can't wait for it to be over with. I love my job, hate this crazy miserable lady I work with and miss my daughter. I would love to be  a SAHM. I'm def going to buy the lotto this weekend. LOL|`|UXhFcHCHaa	nope. to be honest i havent had anyone comment on me when im buying my son formula at the store. there are no protesters at my sons daycare either. its all cyber bullying, i started to ignore it now. my son is taken care of even though i put rice in his bottle, feed him baby food before 6 months and drinks formula. he is the happiest baby you will ever meet and he isnt scared from a little bit of cry it out when he fights his sleep. he wakes up smiling and in such a good mood. its very rare he is upset.also i think its so funny that people on here can type in babycenter.com, kellymom, dr sears and think they are an expect on everything. maybe i should do that and get my top contributer badge.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I wouldn't do those things but I am the kind of mom who states my feelings and doesn't feel bad about it. I wouldn't confront someone about formula feeding but if they brought it up I'd let them know what I thought. I wouldn't protest a daycare unless it was harming children but if a mom asked if I thought it was better to stay home I'd tell her. If I saw someone hitting their child I would absolutely step in and I don't care who says it's not my business. Do what you have to do. As long as your child is loved just breathe deep and never mind the others. If you have to go to work and they judge you for that without any consideration for your circumstances they are small people and they do not matter.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Is there a place in your community where people who don't particularly impress you hang out? Guess what ... a bunch of them are on Y!A and sending you emails.  Some of those people judging you are the same kind of people who make random crank calls, and some of them probably aren't even teenagers yet.  Please don't let them get you upset or impact how your week is going.  Of course you know better what's right for your family than a bunch of people hiding behind their avatars.  <br>  <br>  I share my opinions more freely on here because they're solicited here.  But that doesn't give me license to be rude.  Sorry people were getting to you.  Don't let a malicious comment from an anonymous stranger make you do more than raise an eyebrow.  If you can't help taking things like that to heart, then definitely turn off the email.  (Mine's off even though I have a tough skin ...

What's the point, it's their kid not mine and everyone has their own ways of doing things.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	In real life, people don't come up to me and ask me my opinion or advice on discipline, nutrition, child care, etc. <br>  <br>  If you ask a question on Y!A, you should expect a wide variety of people with a wide variety of opinions and ideas to answer it.|`|723QHuicaa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  My opinions are the same.<br>  <br>  The way I word and say them to people / Y!A users may differ.<br>  <br>  Example -<br>  I am against cry it out. A Y!A user posts a really sincere post about not knowing what to do - I will answer politely about what I think is best. Another user posts an arrogant question saying all mothers who don't allow cry it out end up with whiny cligy kids (which i know to be false) - yes, I will be rude and get on my high horse. Same applies for ''real'' people.<br>  <br>  My opinions never change - my tone and language may differ.

My daughter is perfectly happy and is incredibly smart and independent and this is how life works for us- it's not the life for everyone- but it's the life for me. <br>  <br>  -I always try to add to my answers something like "its your decision, you're the mother, you know your child best" etc.|`|flqAr30laa	the only time im "that mom" is when i see abuse or negligence that could cause harm to the child.<br>  other than that, im good.<br>  some "moms" in here live to bash others and ruffle their feathers.

Except in person I am funnier and more brilliant ;).<br>  <br>  Don't let haters bother you that much. They are not worth it and they tend to be miserable people anyways. You are a good mom and doing what is right for your family- that is ALL that matters.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I try not to get nasty and criticize people on here. I get it myself but i do try not to judge.<br>  I get it in public sometimes too. My experience was over feeding my daughter formula. I was in a baby change room one day changing my daughter's nappy and heating a bottle for her and another mother who was sitting in a chair breastfeeding said to me "Wow, it is amazing how many irresponsible parents feed their baby that poison", referring to the formula. I didn't know what to say so i turned around and said "it is amazing how judgemental other parents can be when they see someone doing something different to what they do".<br>  I am a stay at home mum but i would love to be working to bring in extra money but my fiance and i have decided that it is best for me to stay home. With the skills i have i would make only enough money to cover child care costs so there is no point. <br>  I really would love to shake the hand of every woman who can return to work. They are providing for their family and no one should be put down for that.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I really don't think you should let people on here get to you so much.  Your right..............people will say a lot of things on here that they would not say in public to any-ones face.  We have all been offended on here and received hate mail!!!!

Isn't that neglect? not you i mean them. some of them are on here excessively it makes me wonder how??? they have time. <br>  <br>  also, does "do your own thinking" ring a bell? I wodner if she says HALF the s#it she says to people in real life as she does on ehre (like calls ppl c-words and such)|`|YuVSDBkzaa	First of all, I don't know a single parent who actually uses cloth diapers anymore. I know there are some out there, but I've never been judged for using regular diapers! It's sooooo common place! As far as formula feeding your child, I am a strong supporter for breastfeeding and I did nurse my child until she was almost two but I also didn't have to go back to work until she was almost 2, so I didn't have to deal with pumping, etc. For my second child, I may have to go back to work after a few months and I simply don't know how it will work with pumping. I may have to switch to formula if it's easier. I don't judge people. In the very beginning, I would swear never to send my daughter to day care but when I had to go to work, there was no other option. A parent's opinion can change drastically after dealing with certain situations. Really, no one has the right to judge your decisions. You are not abusing or neglecting your child!!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I try not to offend people on here and in real life. If it's something I really believe in I will assert myself and speak up but things like what someone feeds their child are none of my business. You are taking care of your child just like other parents are taking care of their children and you should not be judged for it. We are all trying to do the best we can. Try not to let the ignorant people get to you.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I am a major breastfeeding advocate, but I understand that not everyone agrees with me!<br>  In real life I am the very same as I am on here! <br>  Any comments I have made that are judgemental to formula are not against people that use it, but that people are not educated properly about the risks associated with it! And, yes I do feel the same about that in real life!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Loving the thumbs down for answering the question she asked!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't think its fair to judge others parenting when my own isn't perfect <br>  example: Everyone hates the octuplet mom, I say my parenting isn't perfect so I am not going to judge hers!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I wouldn't randomly go up to people just because they are buying formula.  But women have been attacked for breastfeeding as well as formula feeding both in real life and on here.<br>  <br>  Also while I don't spend as much time answering formula questions or researching formula, and I don't get as many best answers for formula questions I have done more research into formula than most formula feeding moms and generally just present facts.  I share information with people who ask for it, here and in real life.<br>  <br>  I also get a tonne of hate mail on here sometimes, that's just the way things go online.<br>  <br>  I will say however that "my doctor told me to do it" is a pretty poor excuse.  Doctors make mistakes and none of them no everything.  I've had doctors recommend unnecessary surgery, my first was given too much AND the wrong IV when he was a newborn, the IV was there without my consent.

If i think something is wrong i will say, but not something thats as pathetic as working or formula...god, who do people think they are??<br>  <br>  I have had crap on here for being a young mum, because i decide to drink once in a blue moon, and for my choice of bedtime routine for my 10 month old. Which may i add i do not consider cry it out.<br>  <br>  Oh my god...im a bad mother lol...sometimes it makes me laugh but then i realise what a sad life some people might lead!<br>  <br>  Oh and being a SAHM isnt all its cracked up to be hun...it gets you out of the house and you have a LIFE.

(contacted her supervisor for that one) and strangers walking up to me in target when i am picking up diapers lecturing me about how disposable diapers are destroying the environment and that if i loved my baby at all i would use cloth.  or sitting in the dr. office waiting room and out of nowhere a stranger walks up to me and proceeds to lecture me about making sure don't vaccinate my son.  if i loved him wouldn't do it.   this just irritates the crap out of me.  so i know how you feel.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Oh wow..No i'm not like that in real life, nor am i like that here!<br>  Looks like you've ran into some people who are a little too judgemental. <br>  <br>  Take people like this with a grain of salt.. they are probally in the store next to you buying the same things...if they aren't they may be trying to breath down your throat for something that they are lacking in!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No I am not like that whether it's in real life or over the Internet.

To bad we can't all be so flippin lucky!!! Mother's needing to work is just the times we live in. I had to put my son in daycare at 2 and a half so I could return to school and become a paramedic. Because I did this my son and I are no longer living off the system and actually live quite well. I suppose many of these judgmental SAHM's would have preferred I stay on the system until my son was in full time school (grade 1 ~ six years old) then to return to school. However the reality is that even the lifestyle of a student (living on loans) provided better than that of the system for my son. The ghetto was never somewhere my son belonged. <br>  <br>  I highly doubt these types act this way in public. They would then have to be accountable for their comments and let's be frank here, only mentally slow people don't understand that working for mom's is sometimes a necessity. Ignorance loves outlets and anonymity brings out the "nazi" in some. DON'T let the likes ruin your minute much less your week.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	In "real life" if I get asked a question by someone else I know about a parenting issue or whatnot, I will give them the same heartfelt answer I do on here. I really try not to judge "anyone" on here at all. I do not pay their bills, I do not take care of their family..so what gives me the right to judge them, or force my beliefs down their throats? I will either tell them what I do , or offer suggestions. <br>  <br>  If you choose to breast feed..Awesome..you choose to formula feed..great..your child is being fed. You use disposable diapers? me too have you found any great deals?  You have to work to care for your family..Mom you do what you have to do to keep your family fed, happy and healthy!!!!! <br>  <br>  It really does not matter why someone chooses to use formula over breast...really it doesn't. And anyone who criticizes or looks down upon anyone for it, shame on you...what gives you the right? <br>  And to look down upon a mom in the mall for breast feeding a child without cover...shame on that person as well. <br>  <br>  When has it been a crime to go back to work after having a child? In this day and age , and our economic situation, some can not afford to stay home.  So what!!! Its really no ones business but that person and their family's. <br>  <br>  So START SUPPORTING AND STOP BEING BULLIES!!! that is all.<br>  <br>  --I can get a bit nasty when some people on here , like the trolls or the outrages supermoms start bashing others for no reason at all....and I do the same in real life, if someone truly deserves it. I hope your week gets better.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I don't care what these people think or have to say about me.  I am sorry that they have ruined your week.  Just know that if you ever saw any of them and pointed them out to me I would be glad to punch them for you.<br>  <br>  ETA and I try not to state my opinions on yahoo answers or in real life.  Usually I will complain about things to my husband. If they are things that I think constitute abuse then yes I will say something to anybody to their face or on here. Other than that I leave people alone.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Wow, I'm sorry you're having such a horrible week.  I know how that goes.  Don't feel bad about what you do to keep your kids safe, fed and happy.  In this economy, not too many people can afford to stay home with their kids.  Even if they wanted to.  Not all mothers are cut out to be stay at home Moms even if they had the chance.  Working mothers (I'm one) are excellent mothers and don't let anyone tell you differently.  <br>  <br>  As for your question, I am pretty much the same in life as on Y/A.  So long as the kids are taken care of and being cared for and loved, I mind my own business.  The only time I would get involved is if abuse was suspected.  I certainly wouldn't picket or criticize someone for buying formula or disposable diapers.  I spent enough time in that aisle back in the day!  And you know what? My kids are healthy as horses to this day.  Always have been.  And that's all that matters to me.  I couldn't give a flying fig about someone's opinion on how I raise my kids.  I know I'm doing the best I can by them.  <br>  <br>  Parenting is hard enough without outsiders looking in and making judgements on a situation they know nothing about.   If these mothers you're talking about would spend their energy fighting abuse and raising money for poverty stricken children instead of judging working Moms who happen to use formula and disposable diapers and who are also doing everything they can to make sure their kids have a good life, it would be a better world.<br>  <br>  I sure hope your week gets better.

Sq0aYctzaa	Sweet. Okay, here's what I'm doing, and it's working for me so far:<br>  <br>  First of all, all bodies are different, so I can't tell you EXACTLY what will work. But here's some ideas:<br>  <br>  Work your upper body twice a week. This includes chest, triceps, biceps, forearms, and back. Do it twice a week for about two-three weeks, and then move up to three times a week.<br>  <br>  Do your lower body (gluttes, thighs, hamstrings, calves) at least once a week.<br>  <br>  You can do abs nearly everyday, since they are close to the nutrition of your body and recover faster. Lookup on the internet how to do situps, crunches, crunches on a rubber ball, captains chair, and there's a really good excercise where you kneel, grab some pulldown weights, and then bend your head and upper body down to your thighs. It really works out your abs.<br>  <br>  With weights, start slow, and work up. Do a weight that you can only do 10-12 times.<br>  <br>  If you want abs, the two most important thinsg are not ab workouts, but CARDIO and DIET!!<br>  <br>  Do 30 minutes of cardio (walking, running, biking, etc.) EVERY DAY!!!!<br>  <br>  For diet, cut down on the carbs. What I've been doing is eating a piece of bread with peanut butter in the morning, a half of a cheese and turkey sandwich and wome peanuts in the afternoon, and then some type of meat and non-starchy vegetables at night. And NO EATING after dinner!!!! EVER!!!<br>  <br>  With this diet and cardio, I lost ten punds in 4 weeks, and my pants are already too big, and since you're a guy, it should work well with the high metabolism and all.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and let me know how it goes!!!|`|AA11296427	Go you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sure, don't be afraid to join the school gym.

2f6diQBiaa	Doesn't sound like early menopause. It sounds like PCOS. Luckily, PCOS is very treatable with metformin and clomid. Also, many woman who are overweight and have PCOS have an easier time getting pregnant once they are able to lose about 10% of their body weight through good nutrition and regular exercise. I would definitely ask your doctor about treatments for PCOS. If this is just a family doctor (who may not be an expert in PCOS), you may want to ask him/her for a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist (fertility specialist).<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|ZLpgjLPyaa	Oh i also answered your other question but these are all signs of PCOS not premenopause. I havent had a period since Dec 12th. my RE is giving me provera to induce my period and then I start clomid day 3-7.

jwIdq5qkaa	I think Brianna Belle is a very lovely name.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	it is very pretty|`|E1wGuCavaa	Do you pronounce Brianna like "bri-AN-a" or "bri-ON-a"<br>  <br>  The first Brianna with an "a" as in "and", sounds cute, but the second one, with an "a" as in "swan", I don't like.  I don't like that long a sound in names at all.|`|gBfP67nuaa	thats kinda sounds pornstarish i love the name brianna though :)<br>  <br>  maybe Briayna Isabella?<br>  <br>  or Bella Brianna|`|FThME4mXaa	i like it i dont know y but it sounds pretty|`|1SGhenQBaa	i luv it it's soo cute

roe07rI8aa	I've had a negative test before and been pregnant, as the others say, it's just early to say. However, my negative test pregnancy miscarried at 13 weeks which was devastating at the time. Don't get too caught up in the blue line just yet, take each day as it comes. i went on to have 3 kids, so the happy endings are out there and will be for you. fingers crossed this is the beginning of yours. Good Luck.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	o this sounds way too familiar lol... i have been feeling the exact same way, everything you said sounds just like me minus the spotting... i havent had that... i was suppose to start 2 days ago and i havent yet... i am not getting my hopes up like you said but dang its hard not too... i am sitting here right now talking myself into being preggers lol... i wish you the best of luck, and yes those are all pregnancy symptoms!  ^.^|`|AA10552158	well the best thing is to pray and just take a chance and take a trip to the doctor. i know its easier than said but i was in your same shoes worrying and wondering. but if you don't take that chance to go to the doctor; and if you are in fact pregnant you stand a chance in miscarrying because you may overly stress yourself out So please go to the doctor I am praying for you seriously.|`|hfdYg5h3aa	Well those are all really good signs. i think you do have a really good chance of being pregnant. your hcg levels just might not be high enough yet. you waitng another week and if af still isn't here then go ahead and test. Best of luck and lots of baby dust.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	That sounds very similar to what i am going through now...and i'm almost nine weeks. It could be that the levels in your system are still too low for the test to read. The best thing to do is go get a blood test from a doctor. Those tests are so much more accurate than the in home pregnancy test.
DvriP0Xvaa	well if u don't like it 2 bad <br>  don't look at it dats all<br>  the words dat bother u do not mean ppl are uneducated<br>  im educated and i just like writing like dis cus is faster so <br>  i don't know why it bothers u so much <br>  but is ridiculous u say dat|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I know! It drives me nuts when people say preggo and preggers or plz and cuz. Its really irritating.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	This question again *SIGH*  I really could care less if people say prego, preggers or whatever............who cares?????  We get the point of what they are talking about right?|`|gEWt6eoCaa	What's so bad about it? I mean we usually use it make paragraphs shorter. Just cause you use slang words doesn't mean your uneducated!  It probably bothers you so much because you haven't got used to them.|`|oHNrktxTaa	I guess people use shortened abbreviations such as those, b/c it saves time typing.<br>  <br>  However, it er-ks me too! I am not a fan of it as well.|`|rZXQvA75aa	Ha! Because the use of these words is absolutely asinine. Kind of like when people say "Could I be Pregnate?" If you can't spell the word pregnant then you shouldn't be having sex!|`|xreWOKBYaa	Because it is the god honest truth, these uneducated women should no be breeding.|`|jRSXE7BTaa	Haha because you probably take pride in proper grammar unlike many others in this crazy world.. I'm like you; can't stand when people use "dis" and "dat" and talk all gangster.. Preggers and preggy bug me also. They're not "cute" to me at all.|`|Qo4hxkNzaa	I think too that words like that (preggers, etc.) cheapen the experience.  Pregnancy is a joy and a gracious gift.  It's like saying Xmas at Christmas.  It's so much more than that!! It's special and sacred.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	Well i'm a grammar freak myself but sometimes i will use this slang just because it's shorter and faster to write, like abbreviations, not necessarily uneducated.|`|ryh5AslRaa	I have that same problem...its cause people are afraid to use english I guess, its a shame considering how many people have died to give us that right.
5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby always wanted to be standing at 2 months!  She had the stepping reflex also and would "walk" when you held her arms and walked around with her.  <br>  Don't get a walker, as some suggested.  They have to be able to sit up unsupported to be able to use one.  If your baby is able to hold his head up unsupported, you can try an exersaucer.  My daughter used one at 4 months, and she loved it!  You can also get one of those toys that you put over the baby (an arch), and they can kick at the "pedals".  My baby loved one of those.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	he wants to be held, and usually babies have the stepping reflex for maybe a few months and then it disappears for a little bit then it returns.  Some babies don't like being cuddled and being treated like a 'baby' especially when awake and they want to be able to look at everything around them,  like mine she wanted be standing a lot, so she could have a better view of things, when my mother in law tried to carry her and cuddle her and have her laying in her arms she would cry and cry until we got her and carried her up right or had her standing on our legs.|`|MeYILJeSaa	The thing he does with his feet is the stepping reflex. He's too little for a walker. If your arms get tired maybe put him on the floor and let him kick against the palms of your hands? Or like put him down near a wall or something and kick off? That's really the only thing I can think of.|`|DKfScL8taa	Have you tried buying for him a walker??|`|FPaZ5mWCaa	My baby has always loved to be stood up, just try and occupy him in other ways. He still loves it now, but continuing to occupy/entertain him he is happy lying flat and sitting also. Just one of those things sounds like you have a spirited baby.<br>  <br>  x|`|ied3Ww49aa	Do you mean 11 months??? 11 weeks seems way way to young but if it's months...buy a walker...it will help dramatically.|`|GR3F0WF0aa	buy a walker|`|723QHuicaa	Walkers are not recommended till 6m+ - personally, I bought one and felt it was a waste of money, my daughter HATED being in it. It didnt hold her back though, she walked unaided at 10m.<br>  <br>  Anyway, hold him up, then distract him with toys etc when he starts to fuss.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Lol, my son's the same way, he loves to be standing.  You can hold him as long as your arms will take it, then when it's too long just try and distract him in any way you can.  I sing stupid songs with accompanying dances (yes, really) and give him rattles etc<br>  <br>  Have you tried a jumperoo or similar toy that will keep him upright?  I think I put my son in this when he was just over 3 months, and he loves it.
F2rI3Juaaa	Kids need to explore and use their imagination at any age! The younger the better!|`|bRAmXcowaa	no not at all. Her brain and imagination is at the stage where she wants to imitate those she spends the most time with. There is never a too early, only a when your child is ready, and she is ready now.<br>  <br>  Just dont make it anything to hard for her to put on herself. <br>  Look out for peices or outfits that match some of her favourite tv or story book characters. Or if you are focusing on a particular learning stage (ie colors) get lots of different colored bead necklaces (the retro thick beads that are not likely to be a choking hazard) that way you can continue and learing you have going on, whilst enjoying play time.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	no she isn't. At 18 months they love to explore so i think it would be a good idea.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	no of course not, kids like playing dress up and there's no harm in it, she wants to be like mommy and daddy, take it as a compliment. 18 months does seem a little young but I think she's just really smart and picking up on the fact that mommy and daddy wears bigger clothes than her. She's just curious. Encourage it!<br>  <br>  <br>  when my son was little he had a "dress up trunk" I'd pick up things for it at yard sales and thrift shops, like cowboy hats, and ties and stuff. He loved it. Don't be sucked into buying expensive things at the Disney store.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	If she is doing it already then no!!  Buy her some stuff... I found lots of cute dress-up stuff at Claire's.<br>  <br>  www.claires.com|`|YXDMiGkiaa	wat????? im so confused|`|AA12035186	No, she's not. She'll have lots of fun with it!|`|28ux28S0aa	She probably is too young to do all of the imaginary play that goes along with dress ups (like storylines with princesses and all that), but she is probably exploring putting clothes on and off. If you have some dress ups for her then it will save on laundry when she decides she wants to change her clothes 20x a day. Maybe go with some simple dress ups that are easy for her to take on and off herself without your help. She will get a sense of satisfaction from doing that on her own. This is a fun age!|`|BGIxDWkZaa	I have a feeling you can buy her dress up stuff, and she will not find it nearly as much fun as trying your stuff. She is trying to emulate the most important people in her life. Her parents. I would suggest perhaps a combination of some dress up clothing and some old clothing from you. It is never too early to start encouraging an active imagination.|`|DPegPYRPaa	No I think she'd have loads of fun dressing up. She is starting to want to be self reliant and soon she will be wanting to dress herself! It is a fun way for her to develop some self dependence. <br>  I say go for it!|`|bspRfskYaa	No that's not too young, my daughter had a fairy outfit for her 1st birthday and she loved it.  we bought her some play shoes and she now has a disney princess dress both of which she loves dressing up in.|`|yzFxc5uXaa	no, playing dress up is appropriate for any age so if she already enjoys it why not|`|64Aijvccaa	No, she's not. Besides, she can still use them as she gets older.|`|hBW9vnB0aa	they are never too young for dress up as long as you buy age appropriate stuff|`|6jh2ylTLaa	AHHHHH how sweet! it's good that your daughter is inquisitive about things and wanting to play dressing up!<br>  <br>  The Disney stores have a really good range of dressing up clothes for all ages, and Im sure that they have clothes starting from 5 months upwards. They have everything from Tinkerbell to Phocohontas!<br>  <br>  Hope you find something!!<br>  <br>  xxxxxx|`|lvfqg8Goaa	I don't think any age to too little to encourage imagination and creativity.. If she is discovering dress ups already congratulate and encourage her!! individualisation happens through discovery. My daughter is 12 months old and she loves going through the clean washing with me, she knows socks go on her feet and hats, beanies, scarfs go around her head.. she also attempts to put on pants!! <br>  It is the cutest, i know have her cheap clothes for her to try on so i guess thats dress up, by them generously sized so they can be used over and over!! Big baggy dress ups make the cutest photos anyway!!<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have a very intelligent imaginative daughter!! Well done Mum.|`|IfKTQME0aa	Its sounds like she has already chosen to dress up using your stuff so no need to spend the money just yet.  If she is happy exploring with your shoes and stuff you could give her a pair you don't mind her playing with and maybe an old shirt you don't wear.  It will solve her curiosity.  I think once they start wanting certain dress up clothes (for example, understanding a princess dress or costume idea) then you can decide on spending money.  My daughter is 16 months and will put on my shoes and her dad's shoes and try to walk around in them.  We just let her go.....and she seems happy with that.|`|XGx9WORLaa	NO she is not too young to get dress up clothes for I have a 15 month old and have worked in day care settings for over 4 yrs kids start to play dress up as yound as 13 or 14 months. Obviously each child is different but it is completely normal and you should definately let her explore her curiousities!!!!|`|AA11427354	I work at a preschool and am familiar with children. I always see certain children that are mature for their age they read soon or like boys/girls soon or get to old to play with dolls,etc. This seems like just a child who is going through a stage early nothing to be worried its just a few months early.|`|VONCDGrjaa	No! But there is some restrictions! Here are things that are OK to buy.<br>  1. tutu<br>  2. soft crown<br>  3. princess dress-any other dress up dress without tassels or hard pieces<br>  <br>  Just make sure it is safe and it Fits! No high heels because it could break her poor little ankles. (manly twist)|`|YlLyE8kxaa	No if the child likes it then get it for em they may want to  be a fashion model so get it or you can hurt their future because  you may hurt thier dreams to  be a model or somewhat else. SO DO IT! if you want to|`|CiqbsEOUaa	It's not too young to play dress up but I'd be careful about that type of stuff because my niece her herself playing with her mom's shoes.|`|8e9T5H5jaa	No, I don't thinK she's too young! I can understand your concern, but I'm sure she will be fine!! Just make sure you are buying her age appropriate dress up clothes, obviously!|`|7a5e6e725a65511ddced51fda7106420aa	No if she enjoys it, go for it.|`|121IuT6faa	Not at all...
C8E3fe3xaa	i have a good feeling it's a girl..Congrats either way!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	my gut say girl|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	I think you are having a girl. i don't know why, I just do. <br>  <br>  Good luck though...|`|ca9dEvSAaa	You can't tell by judgeing someone's body. You need an ultrasound. Everyone thinks my baby is a boy by how I carry, but she's all girl. <br>  <br>  Just for fun, I will take a guess and say BOY!|`|iohG0qt8aa	I trust that you need to clean your home or where ever you reside.
bspRfskYaa	I'm still struggling with this one.  My two year old drinks out of a proper cup all day long but still wants a bottle of milk to go to bed with.  People have told me to try stopping it completely or giving her milk in a sippy cup but she won't accept it.  Im not too worried though as my mum said both my sister and I had bottles up until the age of 4 and have fine teeth|`|rOFteEdlaa	my daughter is 18 months old and we got her the sippy cups with straws and then when she started chewing threw them so now she is on the sippy cups she needs to lean backwards or lay down to drink.|`|rMgnmMN9aa	I am going through the same thing with my son. And as horrible as it sounds, if you know he can drink from a sippy cup with no problems then the bottle is simlpy for comfort. As horrible as it sounds, you just need to let him cry it out for a couple nights. He will eventually learn that he isn't getting his bottle and that it's bed time, but you have to stick to your guns, it's very hard, but trust me it pays off when he goes to bed without a bottle. Not to metion it is horrible for his teeth and ears, you don't want him to need tubes, all that is draining into the back toward his ears when he lies with a bottle, or even a nuk, it doesn't matter. He shouldn't be going to bed drinking anything. Like I said it is hard so I wish you all the best!|`|o1hvya8zaa	When my daughter turned one she went from 5 or 6 bottles to 2 a day. One in the morning and one at night. When she was 15 months I took away the morning bottle, then a few weeks later I took away the night bottle. She also used it to go to sleep so I rocked her  to sleep for a few nights and then placed her in her bed. Now she is 16 months and we're working on her falling asleep alone in her toddler bed. I'm using the sleep separation technique. I just recently started 2 nights ago and the first night she was so exhausted she only got out of bed 3 times and fell asleep with no tears. Last night was a completely different story. She cried, screamed and yelled for 1an hour! It was so hard to keep putting her back in her bed but she finally fell asleep. She woke at 3am and wanted to come to bed with me I just layed her back down and sat on the floor until she fell asleep it only took a few minutes. She slept until 9 this morning! So it works it's just hard for a few days until they realize you're not playing! Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.supernanny.com/Advice/-/Your-toddler/-/Toddler-care/The-sleep-separation-technique.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.supernanny.com/Advice/-/Your-...</a>|`|2n93DU71aa	Hey there! I went through all that with my son. What I ended up doing was setting a goal. I decided that Monday would be the day that I TOSS ALL THE BOTTLES out of the house, that I couldn't resort to them during the tough times. I did let my little guy have a Nuk cup to help transition him into cups, I found it very helpful. Also I would never let him have the Nuk during the day, I wanted him to get adjusted to the regular sippy cups during the day when it wasn't taking time away from our sleeping habits! :) Then when night time hit, I would only give him water in the Nuk, he was mad mad mad at me for a while but within the week things started to smooth out. The first three days were the worst, but after that it gets better. Be Strong, Healthy Teeth means a Pretty Smile!!!!|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	My niece is 11 months (she will be 1 in a couple of days)and she is now on whole milk. Her mom just took all the bottles away and she just has sippy cups. The first couple of days are trying but they just need to get used to going to sleep without the bottle. I keep her during the day and she takes 2 naps over here.
KUxEBQuYaa	you just say " hey shut the **** up. im the mother. i will do what i want with my daughter, if you dont like it. then dont say it." <br>  i had to do this to my Inlaws, they kept it up and i asked them to stop and they didn't then i had to shout. and they realized i was serious.  tough love sister. you do what you want with her. she wont want it for long.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	You will get a lot of unsolicited advice on how to raise your child. Just smile, nod, and ignore them. Do as you see fit.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	They are trying to help you, not offend you. The next time they try to "help" you, take it for what it is, help. Tell them you appreciate their advice, but you want to try it your way first.  And it really is better for the baby to sleep in her own crib.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	tell them to shut up lol! next comment my reply seriously would be oooh ok i must have had too much gas and air during labour because i cant rememeber you pushing her out at allll!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	we cosleep too <br>  as for witthout offending are they not doing this to you . tel lit how it is|`|1tmX7xbRaa	simply tell them that your daughter is 6 months old so you must have done something right if you got her this far. and what i always tell my family when they start aggravating me and telling me how to take care of my kid ... 'first of all she is MY kid, when you had your kids you were able to screw them up however you wanted, now it's my turn to screw up my kid (funny right?!) i also tell them that I am the one with her 24/7 so i will do what I think is best for her. PERIOD. she is your child and you know what's best and how you want to raise her. if they want to keep telling you how to raise your kid simply tell them that you appreciate their thoughts but you will do what you feel best. if they can't handle that then simply don't go around them all the time with the baby. and just remember opinions are like a**holes everyone has one and they ALL stink.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Just kindly tell them that you will raise your child the way that you see fit, and that while you value their opinion, for them not to be offended if you choose to not take it!|`|bspRfskYaa	Tbh you've just got to put it bluntly to them, but I still think they will try to impose their views on you.  Some people can't help it, they just like interfering|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Either ignore it or just say i appreciate you trying to help but i don't want to raise her that way so please stop. They will probably mouth back off at you but just have a conversation with the hubby and form a united front. You do most of the standing up to your fam and he do it with his. That way no one is seen as the bad guy. You both just have to let them know you don't want their opinion ALL the time. If not it'll just continue to eat at you until one of you get really mad about it and say something you'll regret. My guy and i have talked about things we will or won't accept around our baby so if it comes up one of us will speak on it.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	do you live with them?? if not, the only reason they know about how you raise your child, is becuase you told them, so don't tell them anymore. <br>  when you are around them, simply do what you want, and smile. <br>  this is something i have had experience with, and the best thing to do is let it roll off your back. they raised kids differently than we did, and they will always have an opinion. it will take too much of your energy and time, trying to convince them to lean your way.  they might stop if they see that you don't really listen to them. or, they might not. either way, let it roll off, becuase saying something, will only make you  and them uncomfortable, and it won't solve anything. if it makes you feel better, when they tell you not to do something that you are getting ready to do (like pick up your crying baby) then tell them why. say, nah. i think she wants to just be held. good luck!|`|w716nZKMaa	You should make it clear to them that this is your daughter, not theirs. Tell them that you know they're just trying to help but you feel as if what you're doing is best for you and your daughter. Sitting down with them and having a talk would be good to tell them how you have been feeling.
y6g0RnuAaa	I feed my son Yobaby yogurt banana/vanilla flavors- those have a little added sugar but are made with whole milk which is best. If you would like to avoid added sugar you can get Yobaby plain and add fruit purees or even chunky fruit- that is what my ped. recommended.|`|RjUWPz5daa	Any storebought yogurts marketed to kids/babies are going to have sugar and other fillers/additives.<br>  <br>  The best thing for your baby (and you!) would be to make it yourself. It's really not difficult at all and you can add different natural flavors.<br>  <br>  Here's the site that I got a recipe from that I've been using about a year now. I love it.

rCgZFa0Paa	While blood tests are extremely accurate, they can tell when the egg implanted and up from there, they can be wrong. It is extremely rare to have them come up negative, especially if you have missed a period. I would speak to your gyno and discuss the symptoms with him or her and possible medical reasons for the lack of a period. If you started a new brand of birth control that can cause you to miss a period as well, or even if you are a little stressed out.|`|J2glFOkhaa	HCG blood tests are pretty much 100%|`|YlLmAADraa	if a blood test was negative then you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  a blood test is 99.9%

I admit I'm paranoid about this world but I do think I'm justified. I realize that your garage is probably locked (I hope) as is your car but I still rather have it in my home where I know it's safe. It's not just a pretty accessory; we women carry our lives in our purses! Our ID, credit cards, debit cards, insurance cards for ourselves and our children plus any other personal items you pack in there. Some women even carry social security cards. Any of these items getting into the wrong hands could be detrimental to you and your family. My first thought when I read your entire question was, 'what if someone breaks into her garage! Her car, keys and purse are all out there making it an easy steal!" I don't mean to lecture but I just had to say it!<br>  <br>  Anyway, when I'm home my purse always goes right into my closet. I have a closet organizer and my purse has a spot on a shelf in there. Being an organized person I have to put it back where it belongs as well as hanging up my coat as soon as I get home. Before I leave the purse in my closet I just take out any needed items such as my cell phone and any small items that made their way in there throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Brit|`|tlu9wlNAaa	i just hang mine up on the coat rack, as long as you know where it is thats all that matters x|`|YW74O9aNaa	Always in my closet when i'm home. :)|`|vp4xjqbLaa	Mine is usually in my bag where ever that is...i did have a Habit of putting my bag just anywhere in the house (hanging on door knobs etc..) now i hang my bag as soon as i get home in the closet at the front door.Try not to leave it in the car or garage ;)<br>  <br>  p.s purse in Australia means wallet bag is what we put our wallet in maybe you mean wallet when you say purse? anyway i think we are still on the same track lol|`|TQW5E6olaa	Mine are on the coat rack inside my front door.|`|prqrQcd1aa	LOL, mine stays on the kitchen table most of the time, or else the dresser in our bed room!<br>  <br>  <br>  EWWWW Calypso3...are you serious..

iAnJ8P3Uaa	Ive definitely have had experience with children. I have 5 kids. Claire 9, Alex 6, Cara, 4, and two newborn twin girls emma and maya. Well Cara is going into a stage where she calls me my name instead of " mommy ". She is a sweet girl and is absoulutely obsessed with animals. She pretends to be an animal and has a million stuffed animals that she thinks are really alive. She especially dislikes vegetables and im trying to get her to like them. She is about 41 inches tall and about 38 pounds.|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	This question kinda creeps me out, why  exactly are you asking?|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My daughter is 39 pounds and and is 42 in.

Weight about 40lbs. Turns 5 in early Summer.
Cv0bGFiCaa	Yes-  it is very possible.  Women are more fertile in the month immediately following a miscarriage.  So she would be right on target to be gettg a + hpt if she miscarried on 1/27.  It is unlikely that she would still have enough HCG in her system to maintain a positive pregnancy test this long after a miscarraige -  especially if she miscarried early.  Best of luck!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	Yes, she can be prego again already. A family member of mine miscarried and within a week was pregnant again. It is possible. I hope your daughter gets her wish. Good luck!!|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Its possible she is, I got pregnant in November and ended up going in for emergency surgery in november that caused a miscarriage.  I was heartbroken.  However I got pregnant again very shortly afterwards.   Because of of the surgery I was put off sex for two weeks, according to the dates I probably got pregnant the first sex I had after the two weeks.  It was kinda crazy we never expected it  to happen so soon, though we hoped for it.  I never even had a proper period after the miscarriage.  I am 13 and half weeks now and feeling  great.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Legally if a child is born of a married woman, the husband is legally presumed to be the father.  You don't need him to sign anything, there shouldn't be any tests.<br>  <br>  You only get into complications and paternity papers if the parents aren't married and are just shacked up, or a one night stand or something. Then either he has to sign a paper admitting he is the dad, and making himself liable for child support, or you have to get a paternity test and prove he is the dad in court, and the judge orders him to pay child support.<br>  <br>  Since you are married, it won't be any problem.|`|sxecXFgraa	You can put your husband on the birth certificate.  They don't automatically do a paternity test and in CO, my husband didn't have to sign anything.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	From what I understand, if you are legally married, your husband is presumed to be the father.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	My husband never had to sign a single thing after our son was born.  I personally had to sign all the stuff about the birth certificate and there was just a blank to fill in the father's name.  He was there, but I don't think it would have been any different if he wasn't.  I'm sure the exact procedures vary from state to state, so I would just either ask a nurse about it (they usually know about that stuff more than the doctors lol) or call to you state's Department of Vital Statistics and ask them.  They know everything in regards to birth certificates there.  As far as paternity paper so, I've never heard of them.  I know that my husband did not have to sign anything of the sort when our son was born.  Also it is very illegal for them to do *anything* to your baby without your consent.  Be careful to read all of the papers they give you to sign when you are filling out hospital admission forms.  I did all the paper work months before my son was born and there was papers that gave consent for various things.  But, no, they do not do a paternity test.|`|g2ulTHNGaa	You can put him on the birth certificate without him being there--how do you think women who have had children & the father is deceased before the birth have done their childrens' birth certificates? <br>   They don't run paternity test unless there is a question as to who the father is & it must be requested.|`|kU48K7ugaa	In most states, the husband of the woman is considered the father regardless - unless proved otherwise.  Where do you live?  In MN my husband did not have to sign anything.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Yes, in most places the father doesn't sign the birth certificate anyways. He just signs, no test. And you need to really tell us the state you live in to get a more specific answer.|`|AA12174100	ask the hospital how that is handled. But also, if you are married then your husband is legally the father even if you got pregnant by someone else.|`|AA11612196	well my dad was in prison or something when i was born but he is on my birth certificate~ call the hospital and ask<br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjNiG5ttPo9LcvPqpUx4sYnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226135539AAPUFiW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes.He is the father.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	if you're married you can put your husbands name down since they assume he's the father. when i had my baby i put my husbands name down and he didn't have to sign anything if he didn't want to. Just a few days after she was born i had to go to the registrar office of the hospital to sign the birth certificate and some social security stuff but i made my husband go and he signed it. But i could of done it myself without him being around. You're married so it's easy, for the ones that aren't they have to have the father present.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	That for not married people<br>  <br>  Married people, they assume the child is from the married couple<br>  Yes you can put you husband on the birth certificate, and if he dies, you can put him on the birth certificate and contact social security and get money|`|8RfmosODaa	Yes you can put him on the birth certificate if he is not there.
s9aWvVCeaa	Yes, i thought it was VERY ignorant for that women to even have nerve for a site so people can pay her to take care of her kids. what a loser.|`|DC64wxBeaa	I wouldn't want that to happen to any woman or parents.  But Nadya is a whole different matter, IMO she's taking advantage of her kids to make money.  By the way check out her nose if you don't believe me.  Plus she should have figured a way to support all them kids before she got artificially insemenated.  So I wouldn't really care if her kids were taken from her|`|MXMGd0Xaaa	yeahh shes crazy.<br>  she already had 6. thats more than enough.<br>  that dr was crazy nd should get his licence taken away.<br>  the dougars have like 18 kids, but they have money (not alot) nd the kids ages are spaced out. this lady has no job nd is living w/ her parents. if she had a job her own place and a husband...and maybe not those other 6 kids...maybe like 1-3 it would be okay.<br>  <br>  she made her lips fat like angie. <br>  <br>  maybe not lose....but she needs somethin done. in the sipmsons the 8 babies were basicly rasied at the zoo nd had shows nd stuff....nd they gov't/ppl basicly owned them...that did actually happen in real life in canada.|`|EXPdJVLaaa	Yea! <br>  <br>  She is a poor lady who can't take care of them! <br>  I mean a porn company wants to sign her for 1 million bucks but that is bad to your kids! ALL 14 OF EM!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	No go away leave her alone|`|723QHuicaa	I really am torn on this one...<br>  <br>  On one hand -<br>  She is a single mother, jobless, about to be homeless, is looking for the state and th public to support her and her family, she cannot afford to care for her kids but she can afford IVF, I think she knew all along what she was doing and planned the media circus.<br>  <br>  On the other hand -<br>  Far worse mothers who physically and mentally abuse their kids, never get them taken away, despite what she has done I dont doubt she loves them, ALL 14 are precious and deserve love and security, perhaps she was as stupid as she makes out - maybe she did think by implanting 6 embryos she would only get one or two.<br>  <br>  I dont know on this one... Its hard and its not a decision the people in charge should be taking lightly.<br>  <br>  <br>  *** I do however think it is right that the hospital will not release the 8 newborns to her - i think that is a fair decision concerning her living arrangements and instability - it would be ludacrous to release those babys into that situation|`|92iuiuZKaa	No I don't think so|`|Bww3poJNaa	I have to agree with what the hospital is telling her. They have given her a list of demands before she can have the babies come home from the hospital. I don't think they should be taking away they are her children. The woman is in denial about everything, it's like it's hard for her to admit she shouldn't have done what she did, but they are here and people need to help those kids, not her, for the KIDS.|`|CblODn2Kaa	I think they should be taken away for a while, until her living situation can be evaluated to make sure her kids will be safe and well-cared for. I doubt they will, but she should be given the chance to show she can keep them. I also think she needs to see a psychiatrist, she obviously has some sort of mental instability that needs to be treated.|`|J2glFOkhaa	I sure do. She is a dirty liar<br>  <br>  First she lied and said she doesn't receive any help from the government for her kids. Liar! She gets food stamps and disability checks for her kids!!<br>  <br>  She claims she never had plastic surgery to look like Angelina Jolie. Liar! Did you see her before picture?? Oh my goodness! It's a completely different person! She clearly had work done to her face, most drastically her nose. <br>  <br>  Her ex.. which may I add, is not the mystery "Mr. Solomon" who she claims fathered her kids.. says that he donated sperm to her THREE times because she told him she had ovarian cancer!!! WHAT A LIAR!!!<br>  <br>  She said she would live with her parents and be just fine.. but that house is going up for auction in May because her mom is over $23,000 behind on her mortgage. How are you going to live in a house that you're about to lose?<br>  <br>  She is INSANE!!! Take those poor babies away!!|`|2ydF6OTAaa	I'm not going to say take them away, however she does not need to have anymore.|`|nwuL7M7saa	I think she at least deserves a chance to prove herself with all 14. I agree that with 6 kids already, she didn't need to get in vitro. But they're her kids & she needs to get her sh*t together in order to keep them & be able to provide for them.<br>  <br>  If she really wants to prove herself, she should get her family and friends together for help & not depend on the government. She needs to get a job & deal with her consequences.|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	No. I would not want to be taken away from my mom and separated from my siblings just because she didn't have enough money to take care of us. If they do get taken away then ALL SIX of the older kids should go to the same home, and if that person is willing to take the eight babies too then they should be able to. The babies don't necessarily need to stay together since they wouldn't remember their mom or their siblings.|`|AA11296044	You cannot start taking children away from families for being poor.  Like it or not reproduction is a right and whether you have money or not you are free to have as many children as you can.<br>  <br>  We would open up a giant can of worms if we started taking children away from poor people.   You loose you job, bang - there go your kids too.<br>  <br>  Bringing 14 children into the world with no income is absolutely irresponsible.  However if you apply the rule to one mother, you apply it to them all.|`|lN0GkKgaaa	Unfortunately yes. <br>  <br>  She has no job or income, and starting March 5 she will have no house for those kids.<br>  <br>  The hospital is already with-holding the release of the babies to Nadya.<br>  <br>  It's time for CPS to intervene and find homes for these children.<br>  <br>  It's sad, but its whats best for every single one of those kids. It's not fair for them to continue living how they are living. There is no way Nadya can take on all of her children if they ever release all 8 babies to her. She has no job.. her parents have no job..<br>  <br>  Sad reality.. those kids deserve better homes.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Someone else said we shouldn't because we wouldn't take anyone else kids away if they had 14 of them.... yeah you're right, but we would if they couldn't be cared for properly. And her children aren't being care for properly. If she can't afford to take care of them, she doesn't have a job and isn't getting one or planning on getting one, that is child endangerment. <br>  <br>  She should be given a warning and a deadline. If they requirements are not followed and time runs out, then too bad for her, she had her chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have NO problem with people having large families, by the way. I want a VERY large one myself. I'd love to have 14 children, I'd love to have 27 children. (Adopted and my own) Nothing wrong with big families so long as they are cared for properly.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	wow ph_sux that was really over the top, death threats b/c she has to many children is crazy. It doesn't matter if she should the reality is she probably won't. Many people in this world have children they can't afford. Children do become homeless when their parents are too rite? So what makes her case so special. Everyone should just leave her alone and mind your own business. It has nothing to do with you, everyone wants to say i pay taxes so i have a rite to run off my fat mouth about her. Whatever if she had no children you would still be paying taxes so get over it already.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Yes she should lose them, of course either way we will be supporting them either through welfare to her or foster care.  But with young healthy babies, usually they are quickly adopted.  That woman has a screw loose.|`|BO28Mn8haa	man that attention whore ***** should lose her kids and her rights to ever bearing another child
bRAmXcowaa	Yes it will pass, the reason she does it is because she has decided it is the best way to get attention - either yours when you respond to her, plus extra attention from your mother in law and any passers by. <br>  She knows exactly who you are (her mum) but has had the behaviour re-enforced by your mother in law. Your mother in law needs to stop immediatly. It is not funny.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, encourage your daughter to call you mum, and when she does, react with more excitment and quicker than you do when she calls you Mary. im not saying ignor her when she calls you mary, just count to 3 before you answer her and try to refrain from using pet names when you respond (ie she calls you mary, dont say "yes honey". Just count to 3, then say "yes") <br>  This will eventually show her that if she calls you mum, she gets a faster and sweeter response. But make your mother in law stop or it will only confuse your daughter|`|OYOYJktkaa	Well, it IS the terrible twos. Addressing a parent by his or her first name is a sign of disrespect, and you may have to start punishing her for it.<br>  <br>  Also, straighten out your mother in law. It's YOUR daughter, not hers. Let her know on no uncertain terms how much grief her little stunt caused you.|`|kuBXTToGaa	well my daughter did this and she is almost 3 and well shes really sensative and i told her that she was gonna be names juan coco and she said that i hurt her feelings and i told her well if u dont want me to change ur name and hurt ur feelings then dont hurt mine and everytime she called me Damaris i called her juan coco and it took about a week 4 her to stop well good luck|`|WWfL5tMvaa	try to tell her every time she calls you with your name that you are her mom and this is what you like her to call you with. Don't get mad at her it is not her fault. My mother in low tried to do that with my son but i guess my name was hard for him. they think we like that. they are from a different world than ours. <br>  not to make my son confused i even call my husband dad and my husband calls me mom sometimes to make him know that this is dad and this is mom.. might sound crazy ha!! but i hope it will work<br>  wish you the best|`|3HR1SfGMaa	Ignore her completely when she calls you by your first name.  Act as if she's not even there, and do not respond to her until she says mom, mommy or some variation.  My daughter did this too and thats how I got her to stop.  She will still occasionally do it and then she'll remember that mommy doesn't hear THAT name and she'll scream mommmyyyyyy|`|rOFteEdlaa	maybe talk to grandma and tell her your feelings and then sit your daughter down and say im mommy to you not mary and it hurts my feelings when you call me by my name because i feel like you don't want me as your mommy.|`|BG0z9rYOaa	Biggest problem here is your Mother in law but please chill out.  Can quite believe that this is upsetting you as Mary is actually your name.  Many children do this my son used to but he also knew I was his Mum.  Never made any issue over it as my friends would all call me by my name so cant see any problem apart from you and you Mother in law.|`|771bFixmaa	My son does this to and he is the same age. My husband and I have taught him our real names so he knows them.. When we ask him what our name is he says our name and then we say but what do you call us? he says Mommy or Daddy.   That was very rude of your mother in law to do but I think if you correct your daughter then she will get that your Mommy. Good luck!|`|XDPEiV6Aaa	Yes it should pass! I nanny a two year old and she thinks it's absolutely hysterical to call her mother by her first name! She does it because she knows she's not supposed to and it's funny to other people haha, it's the age
WlU3NFu6aa	you can either gradually switch it or just completely switch it. my daughter was fine with the switch. i didnt need to gradually do it. she likes whole milk better. <br>  as for the bottle, we are still working on it at almost 14 months. <br>  she took her first steps at 9 mo and was walking well at 10 months. <br>  we had a party for her in a hotel ball room. first bdays are a big deal in hawaii.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	well mine is only going on 8 mons--but the best way to wean her from formula to cow's milk is like this:<br>  week 1:<br>  7 oz of formula, 1 oz of milk<br>  <br>  week 2:<br>  6 oz of formula, 2 oz of milk<br>  <br>  week 3:<br>  5 oz of formula, 3 oz of milk<br>  <br>  week4:<br>  4 oz of formula, 4 oz of milk<br>  <br>  week 5:<br>  3 oz of formula, 5 oz of milk<br>  <br>  and so on until you get to all cow's milk. you can do it in 2-3 days instead of a whole week also. also, you can start putting milk in her foods now---like in her oatmeal etc if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  as for her 1st bday, don't make it a stressful event, make it a special event. I plan to have something very simple for my baby's b-day in July, a small group at a public park with bbq, but I am not of your culture, but still dont burn yourself out about it. maybe you could have it at a korean or some other fancy restaurant and reserve a large table? and maybe make your own cake? or buy a fancy cake? and lots of large nice balloons always add extra flare.|`|y999LLxdaa	1. To switch my baby from formula to milk i started of by mixing the 2 together until she was ok drinking milk by itself.<br>  2. My baby started walking at 10.5 month but i never put her in a walked i used a jumper i heard that walkers aren't as good as jumpers because your baby learns to push herself rather then hold herself.<br>  3. Birthday wise i did it at home with all the family ( about 30 people) and plan it to Start right After her nap that way she's not fussy.<br>  Good Luck.|`|kY8JTDD6aa	Only one suggestion.  I made a big mistake celebrating my first child's first birthday after dinner. He was so tired he didn't enjoy any of it.  Poor little tike.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	I know how you feel, Juliace is 1 1/2 already!<br>  I weaned him from the bottle and formula at the same time, every few days I would up the amount of milk that I mixed with the formula ( around 11 months) When he was totally on milk, the bottle was GONE! I relaced it with a soft nipple cup, and after a few weeks I used regular/hard nipple cups. He didn't walk untill a week after his 1st birthday.  I threw a big party even though I knew he wouldn't remember.<br>  <br>  Cups that I used were all bought at walmart|`|dyFlOpYqaa	To wean her from a bottle to a cup, you should follow these steps:<br>  <br>  Offer your baby a cup instead of a bottle, and follow her cues. She may seem interested and may drink from it properly; if she has trouble or just refuses, try again in a few days.<br>  <br>  Make a family policy that your baby can't walk around with her drink or play with her bottle. This will make it clear that she needs to eat at regular meal and snack times, rather than always holding on to the bottle. Follow similar rules yourself so you don't send mixed messages. <br>  <br>  <br>  Substitute other things that will comfort your baby if she seems to be using her bottle as a pacifier. These should include extra attention and affection, as well as special games, toys and books. <br>  <br>  If your baby gets thirsty at night, keep a spillproof cup of water nearby and offer it to her in lieu of a bottle when she wakes. The nighttime bottle is often the most difficult to lose, but doing so is important. Using formula, milk or juice at night harms your baby's dental health, as the liquid will pool in the mouth, coat the teeth and lead to severe decay. Bottles also pose a choking hazard.<br>  --------------------------------------...|`|ied3Ww49aa	okay haha I am going to try to answer all your ?'s....I took my son off formula at about 11 months..I started doing half whole milk, half formula by the end of his 12th month he was just on milk..introduced the no spill sippy cup @ 13 months filled w/ milk. He was an early walker..started at about 9 months...but ALL toddlers are different!! Do not compare ur daughter to anyone else! First bday...did an intimate trip to SeaWorld...just my mom, brother, sister in law and my husband @ the time (son's father). At 1 yrs old, they still need there nap..nd so forth...they still have a routine. I knew he would be cranky if I threw his a huge party!<br>  <br>  I hear u w/ the culture!! I am hawaiian/filipino so my family expected a HUGE..ALL OUT party! But..I had to put my foot down and keep it simple for the first year so my son would be comfortable..content and HAPPY. After our little trip..I had a little get together with extended family so he had a chance to open up presents...but believe me...2nd birthday...he will have a huge party!<br>  <br>  Good luck...any more ?'s e mail me...sorry it's so long!
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	Thanks for admitting that guys are clueless :) I'm TOTALLY kidding. First I think it is very sweet that you would come here and ask to begin with. Second I am sorry to admit that I dont have the answer you are looking for, but I want to wish you both the best.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	It is great that she is very knowledgeable about the possibility of HCG traces left from the miscarriage. She needs to be cautious about being too enthusiastic especially so close to the last unfortunate event. <br>  <br>  Seeing a doctor is a wise decision since they may be able to do a sonogram just to be absolutely certain that this is a pregnancy and not the left over HCG. Also, the doctor may go ahead and take a blood test to see the level of HCG in her blood if it is found. Every 3 days it doubles if it's a viable pregnancy. And if it does, congratulations! :)|`|lPgwZzoWaa	Unless she is still bleeding from the last miscarriage then there shouldn't any HCG in her system left from her last pregnancy!  If she IS still bleeding (and trust me, she would know!) she may have a little bit of left over placenta in there that could show as a pregnancy.  They will do a blood test to see how *much* HCG is in her system and compare it to her last menstrual cycle and see if the amount of HCG matches the conception date.  Or they may do an ultrasound to se if there is a baby in there.  Either way will be conclusive!  I am just pretty sure she IS pregnant though!  Good luck and congrats!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	They will take a blood test<br>  <br>  Depending n her hormone level they will be able to tell if she is still pregnant or not. Her hormone levels should almost be back to normal if she had a miscarriage at the start of January.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss, and good luck|`|AA10312653	they can do blood tests....|`|avkZGv1taa	They will probably do a blood test to get an accurate HCG level.  They can use the number to determine whether or not it is likely a new pregnancy or leftover.<br>  Just for peace of mind now:  As for whether or not it could be left-over HCG from her miscarriage really depends on how far along she was.  HCG levels drop pretty quickly after miscarriage, and especially if she was not very far along, I would guess that this is NOT just leftover... However, if she was further along (like 8-9+ weeks) it is possible that there is just some remaining HCG even after over a month...but still not likely, as other posters have said, the level drops of quickly, and declining levels are one of the major indicators of miscarriage.  Best wishes for your doctor appointment...|`|gCtFKxxxaa	with in days of having your miscarriage your hcg levels drop completely so i don't see how it would be from the last pregnancy. That's one of the ways the doctors tell if you could be miscarrying is from low hcg levels.<br>  <br>  I wish you both the best of luck in adding to your family!!|`|ied3Ww49aa	They will probably do a blood test just to be on the safe side and w/ what you guys had to go through with having a miscarriage, request a blood test so you feel more secure with the answer. But trust your doctor...the test they do will give you a reliable answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3gkiLN73aa	You will know for sure at her doctor appointment, but most likely this is a new pregnancy.  The hormones from her last pregnancy should be out of her system by now.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	There is a chance that she's prego.<br>  <br>  **fingers crossed**
fqdIVD3Yaa	Was your pregnancy an "accident" and now he just doesn't want to accept that he is going to be a father? He sounds like a jerk... sorry. But try and talk to him again and tell him how you feel that you would like him to be there for your child's ultasound and that the grandmother doesn't need to be there and that she can't be in the room anyways because of the one person rule. If he says he wants his mom there instead of him just tell her no. I wouldn't feel comfortable either with my child's grandmother going to appointments with me. It is a mother and father thing, not all of the family. Thats just my opinion. Hope it helps in a way.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	As the primary /sole  patient you are entitled to decide who goes in there with you.<br>  <br>  Next time, tell you doctor you don't want his mother in there, or you don't want him in there either and the doctor will assure your wishes are met.<br>  The doctor cares about his patients comforts and who is in the room is high on the list of comforts or discomforts. That is for pregnancy or any other reason you're at the doctor's!|`|bspRfskYaa	I think you should pick one of your own friends or family - someone who is going to support you.  He has no right to give you an ultimatum, either he wants to see his child or he doesn't, he can't force you to let his mother come.<br>  <br>  Put your foot down now or before you know it you'll be in the delivery room and she'll be holding your leg in the air telling you to push!|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	you need to tell him straight up that you are only allowed one person in there with you, and that if he has to have his mom in the room with the two of you than you are going to take your mom or dad with you to the ultrasound and he will not be notified of any changes after that! stand up for yourself! tell him  NO!!|`|eZAz6orMaa	No, this is YOUR choice, you are kind enough to ALLOW him to come with you...<br>  Him alone or he doesnt go. Plain and simple.<br>  Your the one being ultra-sounded, your the one with the baby inside you. <br>  Whoever makes you the most comforted and least stressed out is the best decision for YOU and YOUR BABY|`|nL8s4ozIaa	mayeb his mother really wants a grandchild. In any case you two are not together anymore, so dont fight to make any more problems bet. u 2. u need to ask him if this baby is important to him with out his mom being there. let him know that only one person can come.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	just because his sperm got you pregnant doesn't mean he is the father, you are more the father now. don't let him go, bring your own mom ( if you have one,still) good-luck|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	just tell him its both of your baby, if you want it to be a personal moment them tel him so! it is pretty mommas boy-ish, if you let her come into the unltrasound then imagine when you go into labour...enough said lol!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Don't let either of them go.  He'll see he's missing out by being immature.  It's your decision and you shouldn't feel uncomfortable.  I can only imagine what he will be telling you when you deliver.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	yeah i'd tell him that only one person is allowed and that if he doesn't want to come just because his mommy cant come then you will just have your own mother or a friend come with you.|`|AA11179513	My advice to you is to not let either one of them go. Show him that this is between you and him not everyone else.|`|eus7WqzUaa	I am sorry but go without him.  Tell him you will mail him pictures.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	tell him no!!  tell him the your inviting him NOT his mother. your sorry if it hurts his feelings but his mother cant go!|`|e0xpYnv1aa	that's so wierd. i'd def. say no to that one haha|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	If that was his attitude, I wouldn't have either in and take a friend instead.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I would say then fine ,you dont go. I know i would not let my b/f's mother come, i get ultrasounds done,and its personal,and your a tad bit exposed. if you dont want his mother there then say no, and bring your own person instead of him, lol look on the bright side at least he doesn't want his mom in the delivery room =D <knock on wood>|`|CVdcrY3kaa	If you're wanting to totally avoid a confrontation, maybe ask the DR (or nurse staff) to only allow one extra person, that way they're the ones telling your boyfriend's mom she can't come in. But...you are having a child with this man, so I would suggest talking to him about it openly and honestly.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	If you want him to be there than I guess Mama is going to be there to.  Yes it is very "Mama's Boy" and a little immature but I guess that is his stipulation!  Weather you two are together or not parenting a child is all about compromise and letting things go.  What better time to practice then before baby is born!  Good Luck.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I'd not let either in, period.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	Go to him like an adult (in private) and tell him nicely, but firmly, you only want him at the ultrasound.  Explain that this is your experience and that's the way you want it.  Tell him you want him to be a part of things, but on those terms.  If he still insists that his mommy comes, invite a friend and send him and mom pictures.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	really i see anything wrong with that,,,  i was in the room for my d/laws scan , all well as her mother , and young son..and hubby we were all invited along ,,and she gave me the pic of the scan..|`|LMc23g9Maa	NO WAY!  Did he want his mum there at the time of conception?  NO, so why does she have to attend now?  Put your foot down and go alone if that's the case.  Show them the photos later.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Take your mother or a good friend... or hell, even a new boyfriend!  Sorry, but the dad sounds immature.  He obviously isn't ready for all this if he needs his mommy there with him.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	huh only one person that's weird we get 3. Oh well why do you want to push his mother away? If he's not helping but his family is showing interest why not get closer with them so you can receive help and your child can know its family? If he was saying he couldn't come without her then i would tell him never mind and just invite his mother myself (he'll probably feel left out but whatever). Ultrasounds aren't that special anyway. I mean its ok but no big deal, just be grateful that his family wants to be around for this. Instead of feeling like they are so bothersome to you and their grandchild.<br>  <br>  I wish both grandmothers could have been able to go to both of our childs ultrasounds (but his fam is from out of town). But im so greatful for all the help she offers.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would tell him that his mommie can't go, sorry.  It is your body and she has to understand that she isn't welcome.  Maybe you will be better off by yourself on this one.  I am married and I don't want my mother in law to come to any of mine!  She is a nice lady and all, but I don't want her around, I am just not that comfortable.  As matter of fact, my father in law insisted that my mother in law go with me to one of my appointments so I wouldn't have to go by myself.  That was the worst appointment ever!  You do whatever you are comfortable with and leave it at that.  You will have to stand your ground!!!  Congrats on your pregnancy and I hope you have a happy and healthy baby!|`|PA5iBQZAaa	well it seems like you have your answer there all you have to do is explain only one person is allowed and you would feel uncomfortable with her in there not that your trying to be rude but  you want the father to be in there just dont say it in a rude way and i think they will be alright i think alot of problems are created by how we say things like our tone or distaste for people try and be as nice as you can be good luck with all this and congratulations and just remember you want this beautiful baby to have a great life that includes all the people who will love him and help protect him so try and understand they want to share this exciting time with you good luck again and God Bless you!|`|nbSp469Waa	If they only allow one other person in there, what is the problem?  Just tell him that only 1 person is allowed. <br>  <br>  If more than one person is allowed, would you allow your mom in the room, if you would than yes it is unfair not to allow his mom in the room for the ultrasound.  It is her grandchild too.  It's not like you are giving birth, you are going in for an ultrasound.  You ******** won't be hanging out or anything.  <br>  <br>  I know I sound mean, but you need to remember that it is his child too and maybe this is something he wants to share with his mom.  <br>  <br>  Too me, a dr appointment is way more personal than an ultrasound.

WGAFP6mSaa	During school: It's not a crime to wish class would end sooner. With these tips, the bell will ring before you know it!<br>  <br>  √ Think in color<br>  Writing notes is a great way to stay alert, but make things seems more interesting: Change pen colors every 30 minutes; write smaller, then larger; use cursive, then print. Breaking the period into sections makes time fly and helps you pay attention.<br>  <br>  √ Pop a mint<br>  Feel like you're about to doze off? Suck on peppermint candy. The taste is so strong, it literally wakes up your brain and gives you a boost of energy,<br>  <br>  √ Doodle<br>  You may think you're making mindless drawings, but creating scribbles that relate to your notes actually help your brain absorb the info. The visual aids will help you remember the material.<br>  <br>  √ Jot your thoughts<br>  Can't stop daydreaming? Get the distracting thoughts out of your head and onto paper- knowing you can deal with them later will gelp you focus more clearly on what the teacher is saying.<br>  <br>  √ Clean you desk<br>  When you take your chemistry textboox, algebra homework, and cell phone off your desk, there's nothing left to distract you. All the clutter makes it tough to concentrate because your mind has to work extra hard just to keep up with what's happening in class.<br>  <br>  √ Relate it to your life<br>  Connect what you're learning to something else in your life, so you're more engaged in the material. Love ''The Hills''? In your pyschology class, use the theories you've learned to figure out why Heidi keeps forgiving Spencer, or why LC goes for bad boys.|`|w2kofruFaa	Could you possibly just be tuning out what you don't want to hear?

ss3ZU4KCaa	Technically the doctor told me to use condoms for the first month after i quit taking my birth control so my body could readjust. Plus that way, i would have a more accurate time line when looking for missed periods, etc. Since getting off the pill really can screw up your menstrual cycle. Waiting a month or two before even trying is really more for your sanity than a baby's safety. I didn't use protection with my husband and am now pregnant. Adding the days, it was less than two weeks after i quit taking the pill. All is good so far in the pregnancy.|`|jRSXE7BTaa	No it can't.

AA11296427	No props. Why not take a pic of you smiling and being natural? That all ways looks the best.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hate MySpace poses. LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|kC37dRRIaa	Be real and yourself :]<br>  No need you prop it up.|`|gA22md42aa	get a nice background that won't clash with your skin tone and outfit... I hate backgrounds that distracts from the person in the picture.
n3PE2lvDaa	as you said it is completly your guys desision but I will put some good points and bad points of both to help you decide<br>  <br>  Good points of waiting;<br>  you will be able to travel, party and do all those fun things while you are still young<br>  you will be able to get stable jobs and build up an income maybe even buy a home first.<br>  you will be able to mature as a couple more before having kides<br>  <br>  Good points of having baby now<br>  You will be young parents which will mean it is more likely that you will conceive a healthy baby<br>  you will have alot of energy to run around after the kides as you are so young<br>  you will have more chance of being a young grandma and better able to enjoy your grandkides<br>  If conception dosnt happen instantly or you have troube conceiving then you will have more time to work through any problems. And if it takes 5 years to fall pregnant then better to start early (just a small possibilty not really something you need to worry to much about im sure) =)<br>  Your kides will be out of home earlier which means you will be free to travel the world and stuff in your 40s<br>  <br>  bad points of waiting<br>  Like I mentioned. You may wait and then find that conceiving is not as easy as you thought and then may wish you had started earlier (not many people go through this so I wouldnt worry too much)<br>  Having kides later may mean grandkids are born when you are older and not able to have much fun with them<br>  kides leave home later! haha<br>  <br>  Bad points of having them now<br>  may not be as finacially secure as you will be in a few years<br>  May miss out on alot of fun things you still want to do in your early 20s<br>  you may not feel ready to have them yet and may not have as much patience as you will in a few years<br>  <br>  We decided to have our daughter early (me 23 parnter 26). it was the best desision we have ever made.<br>  <br>  what ever you decide will be the right choice! good luck|`|8RfmosODaa	Your right the decision is yours and one only you can make. I personally got pregnant with my now husband 6 months after we met. Our son was a surprise. You guys have been together for awhile so if you wanted to go ahead and start a family I say go for it! You have to think how old you guys wanna be when you become parents.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i say noone is ever really ready for children, if you feel you could be prepared for a child then go ahead. if you want children now, don't worry about what others say. you have been with your husband for a long time so what better time.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I say if you both WANT a baby and you're financially stable enough for one...go for it. You've been together a while so ya'll have had plenty of "us" time. My hubby and I have been together for 3, married for 2 1/2 and we have a 3 1/2 month old. We're happier now than before. No real stress brought on by the baby...It really depends on the people. Talk to your man and if ya'll are both ready, go for it. There is nothing greater in the world than to have a child with your soul mate and best friend...to love that child, and have your child's love in return. It's something very special.|`|LZiDTLHOaa	it's really up to the two of you!  Do you want to travel together?  Do you still like to party?  do you have a home and steady income?  Are you ready to put everything else in your life and relationship second?? Including sex?  Marriage is a beautiful thing if you married the right guy, and can be made more perfect with a baby (babies). timing is up to the couple.  Just remember, the two of you won't get a quiet night alone together for 18 years at least once you do start that family! :)|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Me and my husband waited till we were married a year, then we started trying we got pregnant right away, I had my first baby at 24 years old, 2nd baby at 27 years old, and 3rd baby at 31 years old. We had our year to have plenty of fun. It worked out perfectly for us. We are done having babies though 3 is enough. Good Luck.|`|bspRfskYaa	Go for it!  You're young and healthy and it could take up to a year for you to get pregnant anyway.  My advice would be don't necessarily "try" (calculate when your ovulating etc) just stop trying not to get pregnant and see what happens.<br>  Good luck!|`|VdnAH78Xaa	im all for having kids young.<br>  if your in a stable relationship and have a good income and home for a baby have one.|`|kY8JTDD6aa	I got married at 20 and cried when I had my first period I wanted a baby that bad, but hey really it's up to you.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	my hubby and i got pregnant two months after we got married, everyone thought it was too soon...we wern't trying, it just happened. Now that we are pregnant we're happy because we both know we only want one child and this one will be out of the house by the time i'm 37 :) my husband and i are both excited to enjoy our middle-ages together doing what we please.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	There's never a perfect time to have a child. If you're secure in your marriage, financially responsible, and mature enough -- go for it. Children are blessings.
yKS2UI87aa	Tell him to grow up. If he doesn't like her to cry maybe he should help you and try and get her not to cry ..feed her change her etc. I'm going to assume your baby is young and cannot talk yet so there is really no point in doing this other than to be mean. A baby cries to try and communicate a need not be annoying. He however, can talk and all this proves is he is the annoying one and is extremely selfish, mean and cruel. He acting like he's about 7-9 years old that's the age you would expect something like that.|`|6ahPHPBKaa	Ohh, that would really annoy me too. In fact, just imagining someone doing that to my son when he cries is enough to make me feel annoyed! It doesn't help, and it's just rude and immature. She is crying because something is wrong, and mimicking her cry in her face won't help to fix it, it will just aggravate the situation. <br>  <br>  Wait until a time when your daughter isn't crying and you're not all wound up, then calmly tell him how upset it makes you feel when he does it.  Hopefully he'll see that it is really bothering you, and stop it. <br>  <br>  Good for you for leaving the room when he does it, i'd get very angry if it was me, and end up saying something I'd no doubt later regret!!|`|3vzxSKLcaa	No that is not very apropriate.  Reassure him that the baby is not crying to punish you, or to be annoying, they are crying because they can't tell you what they want, they are scared, uncomfortable, and you are the only one who can help them.  So tell him to grow up.|`|a0cf466e46f40d4ab5c32d656a4a89f6aa	Tell him that its not very good parenting of him to do that.. and im sure the baby dosent do it on purpose its her only way of communication. Do something that he does that annoys you to him and ask him how does he like it? No offence to you but he sounds like a Jerk!<br>  <br>  Good luck Dear!!!|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I've heard somewhere that sometimes this works to make the baby stop crying.  It's kind of the same as showing them to themselves in the mirror.  I can't imagine it's great to do it all the time, and if it bothers you, he really shouldn't be doing it at all.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	I agree, tell him to grow up!! When he mimics your baby in her face, be the mature and responisble one and take the baby away from him, don't just walk away.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Sounds kind of mean to me. Seriously...your baby is a baby, they cry.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	its sounds a little immature if you ask me. I would say something if I were you.|`|wZ2zO176aa	men can become very immature when they don't know how to deal with children. in my case, my fiance didn't know how to react to my small daughters crying, so I asked him to watch me, and I calmly addressed her problem, and stoped her crying with love and understanding. He eventually learned it was much easier to address her needs, than to become annoyed. Maybe you could explain that babies do not realize that they are being annoying, and that he need to find a way to address the problem to stop the crying. You may also want to consider that he may not be the person you want your daughter to look to as a male role-model.|`|ia7lyDuFaa	You have every right to be annoyed..frankly I think his behavior is down right mean and I would smack someone if they did that to my baby - I don't care if it was his dad or not.  <br>  <br>  He sounds like an ***.  Tell him to grow up.  Babies cry because they can't talk and that is the only way they have to let us know they need something. <br>  <br>  Sorry - this makes me really mad - mean *** man-babies like him shouldn't be dads.|`|sVWVEnkkaa	How old is your SO,  5?  Seriously,  that is way immature and it's a bad example to set for your baby.|`|KF4OtZ4Kaa	Tell him to grow up!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Tell him to grow up.<br>  <br>  Seriously, that's a bit immature.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Babies cry to communicate, they don't do it to be annoying.  And how on earth can he think a baby can perceive a face as being annoying?<br>  <br>  Your OH sounds very immature, he needs to get a grip.  I don't know what you can do about him other than just walk away.|`|EeGgovyCaa	As immature as it sound, it actually works. I've done that when my babies are whining. I would make a whine sound to and they look at me like "that's a strange noise you're making" After awhile, the mimicing is funny to them and they will start to giggle.<br>  <br>  Now if they are full on crying like, I'm hungry or tired then mimicing them would be just mean.|`|nmu6coapaa	My fiance does this to my son too and I hate it! He patronizes him and I really cant stand it. We fall out about it all the time b/c he claims our son doesn't know what he's saying! Just talk to him again, guys can be idiots!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Well since your obviously with a real caring individual-NOT What a creep. I wouldn't leave him alone in the room with my baby!|`|RExvPeD5aa	thats men for you, i know another man abit like that.
w2kofruFaa	Just sit her down and tell her. Explain to her that you were just mad, and out of anger, you said something you did not mean. Then, while you're at it, tell her why you were mad and ask her if she could let you talk on the phone with a little privacy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
IIY9KPnZaa	the only way to know for sure is a pregnancy test....<br>  but when you are pregnant you will have no doubt about it.. you will just know..|`|wHOfvacjaa	The only way to truly know is to talk to your doctor, but it sounds like it. :(

NOT a good look.
ZSBZ83Dpaa	You handled this perfectly right. You gave your daughter several chances to shape up, and at age seven she should know how to control herself better in school. The spanking she got was necessary to impress her with the seriousness of the matter. I trust that your husband was not too hard on her. I would have given mine perhaps 10 spanks in that situation, accompanied by lots of talking and a hug afterwards.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You did the right thing as good parents. I wish other parents would be good parents like you.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. grade Teacher )|`|f9crUDTwaa	I'm glad to see that you are trying to help your daughter in spite of the politically correct crowd . I'm sure someone will tell you what evil parents you are . Personally I applaud you and your husband for sticking to your guns no matter how much it hurts you .|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i think you and your husband handle this punishment perfectly.  She has her warnings, and she didn't behave still, that's why she got the spanking.  I think it is good disciplining.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	No dear, you handled the situation fine. I mean yall gave her four warnings for crying outloud. That spanking was rather nice compared to what yall COULD have done.<br>  <br>  You two could have gotten her in front the class and tore her butt up there, however, I'm glad that you did not do that. B/c that's so unnecessary.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	I cannot criticize the way  you decide to discipline your child.  I never spanked my kids but I did not have children who misbehaved in school.  Why not let the counselor at school talk to her.  Some behavior is a direct result of something going on at school.  It is worth a try. Most schools have counselors that specialize in behavior problems.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	Teachers set up systems like the card system, because they cannot discipline the children themselves. Therefore they are hoping parents will deal with discipline issues at home. Unfortunately many parents are lax on discipline when it comes to misbehavior at school (or babysitters or at a friends house or during sports practice, etc). This results in kids who only obey when the parent is there to oversee what they are doing.<br>  <br>  I am glad to see that you and your husband finally agreed to treat misbehavior at school as a serious issue. It should be as important that your daughter behave outside the home, as it is when you are there. You want her to be in the habit of behaving well at all times. After all, you are ultimately responsible for what she does even when you are not there to supervise. Her behavior and attitude reflects back on you.|`|ouUti34faa	As long as what the teacher is doing isn't just BS trying to get her in trouble (sometimes that happens) then yes, you did just fine. Children use to get spanked at school, but since teachers started abusing the right, the responsibility went souly to the parents. Keep it up. Spanking isn't wrong. Beating is,... and it does well for everyone to know the difference.|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	I think this is unacceptable.  I am not a believer in spanking anyways, but my husband is once in a while.  For this situation I believe it was uncalled for.  What happens at school should be dealt with at school.|`|25yqbW2laa	If he continues to misbehave its ok to set a sort of punishment for the child. I dont know y pppl freak out of spankings. Whats with ppl<br>  well i think its ok to spank and she was warned so ur perfectly fine sweety ok|`|1enIWBGnaa	She knew the rules, she broke them and had to pay the price.<br>  Stick to your rules - sooner or later she will stop or end up with a red bottom for the rest of her life.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	WHY DO YOU DOUBT? Ugh. It's already done, if you don't think its a good idea now, why do you continue to do it?? i dont get why you ask these questions??|`|FG75AjcRaa	duh.. if u dont spank and just keep doing the, "oh honey honey DoNt Do tHat." thing, shell NEVER learn to BEHAVE and will be some stupid selfish brat one day. Parents who dont spank are just plain stupid.|`|2f49jsLpaa	Perhaps there is a reason why she's acting up in class all of the sudden, and not just because she can't "remember" to behave without being spanked. Rather then threatening or spanking her, you need to sit down with her, discuss what's going on, and figure out a good solid plan together on how she can work on her behavior. I've worked with children for many years, and know that this is a sign that something else is probably affecting her behavior, and losing her trust by spanking her is not going to help the situation.
M48vA188aa	Firstly Congratulations!! when i took the test I made an appointment with any doctor and only told him when I saw him (think it was the next week).  I never got tested again! he just got me to book in to see my midwife and she didn't test me either.  I was only confident I was pregnant when I had my 12 week scan - i was actually quite nervous.  If you have spotting then just make sure they test you but I don't think it matters when you go to the doc!!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	My doctor won't see prenatal patients until 9-12 weeks. He will only let you come in for a urine test by a nurse before then, and its the same test you find at a store.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	a positive is a positive, a doctor wont do another test if you have taken one, the sooner you tell your doctor the quicker you get to meet the midwife and other things, good luck :)|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	The spotting is normal and if you got a positive test then you ARE pregnant. The HPTs are testing for HcG which is only found when you are pregnant.. there are such things as false positives but they're VERY rare and they are a result of a faulty test, not your body. <br>  <br>  Anyways, to answer the question, the doctor probably won't see you until you're around 8 weeks. That's what most doctor's do.|`|cSm1zod4aa	They usually will give you their next available appointment so they can confirm the pregnancy so you can start getting your prenatal care ASAP because its very important early on. So you will probably get the next available appointment when you call your doctor. Best of Luck!!
Cv0bGFiCaa	OMG - this is so funny because I do this too.  I am currently 29 weeks.  I did it all the time in my first trimester, and my husband would always tell me the things I said the next day.  We would both laugh soo hard.  I haven't done it in a while so maybe it's just a weird, first trimester pregnancy quirk.<br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt anything so why do anything about it?|`|uuceuyRyaa	nothing you can do, just live with it =)<br>  <br>  when ever you have the baby you should go back to not talkin in your sleep.<br>  <br>  Let's just hope you don't say somthing you dont want too =P|`|PA5iBQZAaa	i talk in my sleep all the time since i was a kid its just like snoring sometimes i hear myself and i always talk about hair brained things crazy things im not sure what can be done about that though good luck and God Bless|`|1o820L3Daa	I do that too, My boyfriend tells me when I do.lol....Ive also done a few embarrassing things in my sleep, but I wont go into that.lol..Lucky he knows when Im asleep I cant be held accountable....I always wonder what Ive said, but he wont tell me.|`|17GuqtQ9aa	you can accept anything in pregnancy , good luck|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	Talk to your Dr. and see what he says.

H74F8jxuaa	Mine was 3500 and I was almost 8 weeks pregnant, but I miscarried, so it might not be a good number to go by because mine might be lower than it is supposed to be due to the miscarriage.|`|C55pji5Qaa	My first was at 3w6d and my second was 4w1d.My numbers were 268 and 681.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I remember mine were 362 then a few days later they were 1,100 - that was when I was around 4-5 weeks pregnant. xx
J9Tbun7naa	Yes it is true. When we are born we have what is called epiphyseal plates....they are basically peices of cartilage that sit between bones. As we grow the cartilage grows to allow our skeleton to grow. Once that part of our body has finished growing the epiphyseal plate hardens to form bone therefore forming one single bone with the peices either side<br>  <br>  Here are some links<br>  <a href="http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Epiphyseal_plate" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Epiphys...</a><br>  <a href="http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit3_3_bone_growth.html" rel="nofollow">http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_a...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&rlz=1T4HPAB_enAU310AU310&ei=pxqnSfi2MJDdnQfk9ZDeDw&resnum=1&q=epiphyseal%20plates&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&rl...</a>|`|ArYvBhkpaa	Yeah,I think that's about right.As they grow the bones fuse together.|`|DKfScL8taa	Just google it.

I know the last one to fuse is the collar bone at about 20 years of age.|`|518798bbc2bda7e567d4666f6f239415aa	The number decreases to 206 - that's how many bones your standard adult has.<br>  <br>  Pictures - sorry, don't have any.
Xu5BtID1aa	For starters, a stable relationship is not 4 months!! 4 months your still in the mushy mushy lovy dovy stage! 2nd of all, if sperm can live when it hits air for about 5 min-10 min.

OLHiZ045aa	You can't really over-feed a baby - they'll just bring up anything they don't need. And you'd soon know if you were underfeeding her - cos she'd tell you, loudly.<br>  <br>  If she's happy and thriving, then you're doing everything right.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	15lbs is about the 40th percentile for a breastfed baby, that's pretty darn close to average.<br>  At birth 7lbs is about the 50th.  Loosing 10 percentiles (or gaining) is not a concern.  Of course if she was up at the 70th a few months ago then being at the 40th now would be a concern<br>  <a href="http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/cht_wfa_girls_p_0_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards...</a><br>  <br>  However she is eating way too many solids, which could be impairing her growth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-how.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/sol...</a><br>  No. Solids during the first year are only meant to complement breastmilk, not take precedence over it or replace any breastfeedings. It is more of a way to add textures to the baby's diet, to allow the baby new experiences, and to help her develop hand/eye coordination through finger feeding. Your baby should still be allowed to nurse on demand, as your milk should be her primary source of nutrition until closer to the end of the first year. Continuing to allow on-demand feedings also better ensures your milk supply. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  6 - 7 months   Offer solids once a day, at most. Many start out offering solids every few days or even less often.<br>  <br>  7 - 9 months   Watch baby's cues - this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested, with a maximum of 2 meals per day.<br>  <br>  9 - 12 months  Watch baby's cues - this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested. Aim for baby getting no more than 25% of her calories from solids by the age of 12 months (some babies eat less than this at 12 months and that's also normal).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/growth/weight-gain_increase.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/gro...</a><br>  What can I do to increase my baby's weight gain?<br>  <br>  There are several simple things that have been proven to help with weight gain:<br>  <br>      * Stop or decrease solid foods, particularly if baby is younger than 6 months. Most solids foods have fewer calories and nutrients than breastmilk, plus they tend to replace (rather than add to) the higher-calorie, more nutritious breastmilk.<br>      * Sleep with your baby (this increases prolactin and frequency of nursing).<br>      * Learn baby massage -- this has been proven to improve digestion and weight gain.<br>      * Carry baby throughout the day in a carrier/sling; get as much skin to skin contact as you can. Both of these things have been shown to improve weight gain.<br>  <br>      * Nurse often - at least every 2 hours during the day and at least once at night. Frequent nursing increases baby's milk intake.<br>      * Make sure you're allowing your baby to completely finish one side before you offer the other by waiting upon her cues that she is finished; i.e. pulling off herself and looking satisfied, going to sleep, changing from an active suck/swallow to more of a pacifier suck, etc. Always OFFER the second side, but don't worry if she doesn't seem to need it. It's much more important that she be allowed to completely finish one side than that she nurse both sides. By doing so she will be assured of reaching enough of the richer, more caloric hindmilk that helps her to go longer between feedings.<br>      * Use breast massage and breast compression during nursing.<br>      * Pump or hand express for a couple of minutes before nursing. This will remove some of the foremilk so that your baby receives more of the richer, higher calorie hindmilk.<br>      * If supplements are medically indicated, breastmilk is preferred over formula as a supplement (exceptions to this are rare), and the average fat/calorie content of mom's milk is higher than that of formula. Mom can pump for 5-10 minutes after nursing (don't interrupt or shorten the nursing session to do this), and offer this higher-fat hindmilk to baby as needed. This is also an option for moms who normally offer expressed milk when they are separated from baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#breastfeedingpatterns" rel="nofollow">http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#br...</a><br>  From eight weeks (2 months) to a year, here are suggested minimum number of times a breastfed baby should be nursing, in a 24 hr span:<br>  <br>  From 2 - 4 months baby should nurse at least 6 times in 24 hr period<br>  <br>  From 4 - 7 months baby should nurse at least 5 times in 24 hr period<br>  <br>  From 7 - 12 months baby should nurse at least 4 times in 24 hr period<br>  <br>  Growth spurts will likely occur at around 10 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, again at 6 months, at 9 months and again around a year. Increased nursing can also be the result of the approach of a new developmental stage, illness, teething, or a result of change or usual routine, or increased stress or activity at home|`|SLph9RX6aa	my baby is 6 1/2 months and i have the same problem he weighs 16lbs now, and loves food, but i often worry if he is getting enough and enough fluids. i give him 3 meals a day, as much as he can eat, sometimes i refill his bowl if he seems to want to carry on. i'm trying to get him to drink water on top of breast milk but he doesn't seem interested. the list of food you give sounds like a good amount.but it does sound abit rigid, maybe you should try to relax abit|`|FPaZ5mWCaa	Try to measure you babies actually intake of milk in time.

Our local public pool used to put a substance in the water that if someone peed that it would change the water color  and follow you around....or at least that's what we kids were told and I was just too afraid to find out.  To this day, I still don't like public swimming pools. I'd rather go to the beach.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I got to thinking about this so-called substance, and so I googled.

And in all sincerity, best of luck to you.|`|yGabEjDMaa	I used cator oil 1/2 a dose those (the full does makes life inthe bathroom a full time job) - takes like crap, so mix it with OJ.

I was inducing at home, only because I was having a c-section in the morning if the baby was not delivered.  WORKED!!!  <br>  <br>  BUT... Discuss this with your doctor hon!  If you are only 17 years old, you need to be supervised and well informed.

8Tku3fxFaa	Top Toddler-feeding Essentials <br>  Toddlers are notoriously picky eaters and yours is likely no exception. Following his first year of rapid growth, your toddler will gain weight more slowly during his second year and will need less food. This developmental change, combined with a toddler's growing need for independence and his inability to sit still for prolonged periods, can turn the dinner table into a battleground.<br>   <br>   When your toddler turns his nose up at a new food or refuses to eat or drink something that was a favorite at one time, don't worry. For toddlers, what and how much they are willing to eat may vary daily. Just offer food that packs lots of nutrition in small doses and makes mealtime fun.<br>   <br>   <br>   ? Make Every Calorie Count-Children ages 1 to 3 years of age require 1,000 to 1,300 calories a day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Nutrient-dense foods eaten at mealtime or as a snack will help keep your active toddler going.<br>   <br>   Some of these foods, many of which are pleasing to even the most discriminating toddler palate, include pasta, peanut butter, potatoes, cheese, eggs, sweet potatoes, avocados and yogurt.<br>   <br>   ? Offer Unique Ways to Try Foods-Be creative with meals as well as with presentation. Finger foods can make mealtime fun for a toddler. Offering different ways to try foods can also make them more appealing. Many toddlers love to eat foods that they can dunk in a dip, such as cream cheese, fruit preserves or guacamole. Foods that can be spread on bread or crackers or sprinkled onto main courses are also popular with the toddler set.<br>   <br>   ? Let Your Child Drink it Up-If your child would rather drink than eat, making nutritious drinks such as smoothies with milk, fruit and yogurt can be a great, healthy snack. Offering drinks in a fun new spill-proof cup, such as the Cupsicle Straw Cup by Munchkin, can keep your child refreshed throughout the day. The Cupsicle is insulated with Ice Cold Crystals that hold the cold inside once the cup is chilled. Just place the cup in the fridge or freezer before use, fill it with a nutritious drink and relax. You know he's much more likely to drink those important fluids if they're fresh and cold. And because fluids and nutrition are important at any age, there is a Cupsicle for every stage of a child's development.<br>   <br>   ? Be a Good Role Model-One of the most effective ways to ensure that your child develops healthy eating habits is to model your own enthusiasm for nutritious food. Limit your intake of junk food and alcohol and eliminate smoking from the household. If your toddler sees you engage in healthful eating and exercise habits, chances are he will grow to want to as well.<br>   <br>   While at times overwhelming, working through your toddler's picky eating habits can be achieved with a little ingenuity and a whole lot of patience.<br>   <br>   Following these essential steps will help ensure your child is getting the nutrients he needs to stay healthy and strong.<br>   By: Adam Johnes<br>   Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>    For more information on infant and toddler-feeding products, visit Munchkin.com.  Cups that keep drinks cold can keep your child refreshed throughout the day.<br>  ?|`|4ffa166d4b1f21c316a464e78d2daf95aa	she may have some sensory issues, some children with autism do not like the feel so certain  food textures.

He is high functioning, but a little lower than Asperger's they say.  He has been a picky eater all his life.  We have learned from early on that he will only eat bland foods without much seasonings or spices.  He would never get away with half of the diet you feed your child.  I would not let him live off of candy bars, oreo cookies, chocolate chip cookies, goldfish, pop tarts and things like that.  No way!  The only acceptable foods I see on your child's list are the pizza, waffles, pancakes, milk, apple juice, grill cheese, chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and chicken nuggets.  You should stop buying all that other junk food.  My son does the same thing with going through phases.  He had a phase where he wanted pear after pear, and then only apples, then pancakes, etc.  I don't allow him all that junk food so he has no choice than to eat other foods.  As long as her phases are healthy then go with them.  You could encourage her to eat the pastas, potatoes, chicken nuggets, etc.  They sell waffles that are whole grain and fortified with vitamins and minerals.  Also try some Carnation Instant Breakfast in her milk.  This might be a little more tollerable than the Pediasure.  My son loves his carbs too, but will also some limited meat and fruits.  I would find another doctor if I were you because yours does not sound very understanding of your child's condition.

Aj99vuqYaa	I occasionally get threatened with a spanking and I'm almost 19. Lol, course I haven't had one since I was pry 14 or so, with the metal end of the belt. The "spankings" I get now are a joke and none are serious at all just a quick smack when I'm being annoying lol. No harm, just a joke.<br>  <br>  Spankings ARE okay to an extent. Until they're 2, no spankings. Just time outs. Tell them they'll get a spanking on the butt when they're older than that. Keep using time outs and only use spankings when no other method works. Take toys away, give chores, etc.<br>  <br>  At the age of your sons, they should just be grounded. Take electronics away (cell phones, computer, tv, video games, etc.). Give them extra chores (especially the ones they hate to do! like clean up after the animals, do dishes for two weeks, etc.). Spankings at that age are just pointless. It stings a little, but it means SO much less to the kid. When they're younger it makes a big difference because they look up to you and see you as their idol and they never wanna make you cry or hurt, and it hurts parents to spank the kids. And the kids see that.<br>  <br>  At this age, however, they couldn't care less. They just know they're getting away with whatever they did with just a pathetic butt beating. <br>  <br>  Find a new method if you're actually trying to punish them and send a message to them and getting a point across.|`|AA10730513	Age is irrelevant as long as they have the strength & balance to not get severely injured by it. (Like I would be afraid of giving a kid whiplash if I spanked their bottom the day they learned how to walk.)<br>  <br>  I have an aunt who makes sure her son, who is grown and has kids of his own, knows that he isn't too old to be put over her knee! (Definitely not normal age wise. But if you knew my cousin - you would probably understand. ... He's not really bad, but he definitely classifies as naughty!)<br>  <br>  I think it varies by family. But I personally don't think I will be spanking any tushes before my kids reach 18 months (at that point it doesn't even hurt because of pullups) or after they are 8 or 9 years old.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i quit spanking at about 5. it , in my experience, is very uneffective after that age.<br>  the point if to punish/dicsipline right? so why do something as ineffective as spanking a teenager? actually, they probably like it. becuase it can't possibily hurt them, and they would rather get spanked and have the puinishment last for 10 seconds as opposed to grounded for their behavoir, for days.see what i mean? <br>  i know my teens would jump for joy, if they could get away with just getting spanked for punishment, instead of the ipod, xbox and tv being taken away!<br>  <br>  as far as a good smack in the mouth?? if they lose their mind, and become smart alec, disrespectful, they do get popped in the mouth. but, i actually have only had to do that once, and they learned real quick, its embarassing to get popped at wal-mart, and mom don't care where we are.  a guy actually clapped when i smacked my daughter at wal-mart, she told me to shut-up. he said,and i quote  "now thats a punishment that fits the crime!"|`|zwvDITr5aa	Hellooooooo, that's defined in the criminal code as assault. I hope your kids are smart enough to phone the police, you creep|`|ItcaUb4vaa	No you still need to.  That is what's wrong with America today.  Kids think they are protected by law that when parents' spank them, then they can call 911.  I got PUNCHED by my mom at the age of 16 because I smarted off to her in the store.  Needless to say, I never did it again and that was 17 years ago.  To this day, I don't profanity or anything around my parents.  My kids are 8 and 2 and I still lay into them when they get out of line.  Not child abuse stuff but enough to let them know that daddy does not play.|`|kSZstQ6Paa	I think you do it cause they overact don`t worry though you will get over it one day,i feel bad for you though so i hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Don`t get TOO mad at them there just teenage`s they probably learn it from other Teenager`s that get overacted|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Spanking is not normal at any age.  You need to take some parenting classes.  Time out corner for little ones and Chores for older ones. <br>  Those teenage boys would be scrubbing toilets, washing windows and any other dirty jobs I could think of.  Mine are grown with kids of their own and turned out to be loving and responsible adults.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	that's considered very weird now days. spanking works when the child is very little. once they're old enough to understand, you can move on to more effective punishments. such as grounding or taking stuff away.
IU4uNH97aa	First of all - I love that you were able to see that you could not be able to support your baby and have considered your options. Teenagers who have abortions usually suffer depression later on in life. I don't personally believe in abortion but if you think you could handle it then do it. In some situations i think it's the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Secondly - What does the father want now ? If you decide to keep the baby will he be in this baby's life ? I think you think you should talk to him and you family about this decision because it is going to affect them too. If they are willing to help you raise this child or not.<br>  <br>  You should talk about your options again and see what is the best for you, no one can really decide this except for you and the father.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	will you consider adoption?|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i believe it is a womens choice, however, i think anything after the 1st trimester is just wrong.  you can do an open adoption.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	This is a decision that only you can make.  You need to at least spend the $100 to even find out if you can have it done.  These are the kinds of things that can't be pushed off until the last minute, so you have to decide quickly.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Ok well i won't answer............troll.................... asking ridiculous questions about ralph lauren shoes, summer dresses and IMing and you only mention being pregnant once in three weeks, wouldnt you think this would be a more important subject in your life????? Go and troll elsewhere!!!!! And secondly abortions cost nowhere NEAR $1000!!!!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my advice would sit long and hard about why your decision has changed .....if you read above its cos the abortion is too expensive<br>  <br>  mom were you proud to have me ...sure honey the abortion cost was too high!|`|FPaZ5mWCaa	The fact that you have said you would get way too attached says to me that perhaps you are ready to be a mummy. Nobody is ever financially ready for a baby, its tough but i say keep your little prince or princess and embrace its life, new beginnings.<br>  Best of luck<br>  <br>  x|`|GR3F0WF0aa	money isn't really an reason not to do something that you want you can always find a way to make more either way any choice you make stays with you forever you'll either have that baby or you'll be wondering what if
hoX7hoINaa	I found a cute idea that I wanted to use but didn't get the chance, I'm not good at waiting. Anyways, go out and buy some baby socks, take your husbands socks out of his drawer and put the baby ones in there. (Put his socks in a laundry basket). Put a sign next to the baby socks and say "Make room daddy! I'm moving in!" ...Now, since you put daddy's socks in a laundry basket, have it in an area where you can say "Honey, I got some of your socks washed, can you go put them away in your drawer please? The basket is in (..room..)" When he goes to get the laundry basket, go to your bedroom and pretend to do something and watch his reaction :) Let me know if you try this!|`|iPeiGJpYaa	umm buy a few baby items like a bottle or pacifier and put it into a gift bag and give it to him, or wrap up the pregnancy test and give that to him. Get a shirt made that says Daddy on it, or a shirt for yourself and put baby in the oven or baby on board. <br>  There are some many things you can do that I wanted to do so bad since this is probaly going to be my last child, but I couldn't wait to tell him, I just woke him up out of a sleep, and boy did he wake up, lol<br>  Good luck to you and congrats!!|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Take him out to dinner....have a gift box with you. Tell him it is something special for him, but don't give it to him until after you have ordered. In the box, have a pink rattle and a blue rattle. If you have talked about names before, put the names on the rattles. He'll get the idea...?|`|AA10236979	The best way would be to not tell him and let him figure it out on his own. He'd start wondering why your belly was growing!|`|wohGR1Nkaa	Say to him..<br>  I'm so tired.. Can I have a back massage?<br>  If he says no then say.. your nice.. Denieying the mohter of your child a massage. Then flash him a cheeky grin :)|`|75c742d5acd622a0bb5f444e18bb5853aa	Text message him, haha j/k. I actually did that the first time I got pregnant because my hubby was in a work meeting and couldn't answer his phone. But the second time I got pregnant he knew I was taking the test so he ran upstairs to meet me in the bathroom to see what it said. I always thought it would be cute to take a pic of the test and wrap it in a box and give it to him as a gift. A lot of people do that around the holidays. I couldn't keep it in for more than a minute though. Good luck!!|`|afc668c10a0650c5689ef30d19d03c57aa	On youtube there is this video where she sent him on a hunt. She gave clues and the last one was in the oven. The test was wrapped in a bread pan and a note on top said we have a bun in the oven. <br>  <br>  I thought it was cute|`|GXRoAWNHaa	I had read an idea to where you take him to the place he proposed to you and ask him if he will be a father instead of marrying you :) I thought it was cute.|`|6Icnm17Zaa	get double stuffed oreos and then sayy im double stuffed too yay|`|gsJLU82waa	cut baby pictures out of magazines and leave them around the house and when he says something about it then say i thought u would wanna get used to seeing babies around the house|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Make him a baby themed dinner:  Baby carrots, baby corn, baby back ribs, etc.  Set the table and for napkins use soft clean cloth diapers or something similar.
ojVl4Gowaa	That kills the listeria that could be present in the lunch meat. Listeria is a bacteria that can infect you and then cross the placenta and infect your baby. Listeria is improperly handled meat, and by warming it up to basically flaming you can kill any potential bacteria. For some reason pregnant women are more prone to getting listeria infections so it's best to take precautions. <br>  <br>  On a side note, I know it's hard to live without a basic like cold lunch meat for ten months. I lapsed on Superbowl Sunday and had an Italian sub from a trusted local deli (my friend works there). I know the chances are technically 'slim' but nobody wants to be the statistic that gets infected. So, do your best to warm up lunch meats but if you slip up once and awhile and have a cold one just make sure it's from a place that you trust and know is hygienic.|`|YlLmAADraa	not only have a i never heard of that but i ate lunch meat throughout my entire pregnancy and my son is perfectly fine.|`|BO28Mn8haa	kills the bacteria and the possible harmful bacteria/chemicals/etc<br>  <br>  i suggest you do it :)|`|w9jx0JYLaa	kills any bacteria that may be on it..like listeria|`|hNIof0lbaa	Yeah, it does have to do with killing the bacteria on the meat. However, I highly doubt anything will happen to you if you dont heat it up first! Ive eaten many sandwiches while pregnant & my kids are fine and so am I. At any rate, good luck!|`|57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	it kills a bacteria that can cause complications such as preterm labor called listeria.  it is just a precaution, but one that you may want to take.  good luck with your pregnancy!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	None of the doctors I work with think it's a serious enough risk that warrants heating your deli / sandwich meat, but it certainly doesn't hurt. It's because of the risk for bacterial listeriosis, which only affects about 1500 people each year in the US, including non-pregnant people.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	It kills the bacteria that could be present, and could cause listeria, which can be very harmful to you and your baby.
nw3QBzjCaa	That's strange but I guess she just has your best interest in mind....Have you given her a reason to want to know what you and jamie are talking about? <br>  <br>  When I was your age my mom pretty much let me have my life but every once in a while she would go through my room when i wasn't home and look through my notes and stuff. At the time I thought it was a HUGE deal and hated it. <br>  <br>  Now I am 23 and have my own daughter who is 4 and I'm sure I'll be going through her stuff too when she becomes a teenager. I would just want my daughter to be safe and not be getting into things that could hurt her or get her in trouble.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|zdGpaFlfaa	ur mom is weird|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yeah, uh, your mom has issues.  She needs to grow up and learn that you are maturing and you need to be able tohave your own space.  if you were five, she could do what she is doing.  but you arent.  you are a teenager and you have your own life going on and she doesnt have to be involved in all of it anymore.  I think you should sit down with your mom, tell her how you feel and then say that you are more than happy with sharing with her the things your friends and you talk about, but sending her the texts really is unreasonable.  you are entitled to your own space and your mom needs to trust you.  Good luck!  Oh, and next time your mom hangs up the phone on you, dont call her back.  my god that is so childish! If you want to apologize to her, which was the right thing to do, wait till you see her in person.  That way the both of you had time to cool it and she would likely be less upset.  But its good that you tried to be the better person...it almost sounds like you are more mature than she is!  I hope things work out!|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I think that is quite abit over the line on her part. I think you handled it well. She might be curious to know about what is going on with your life; however, she was rude and very noisy when no need to be. <br>  <br>  Very rude of her to hang up on you.<br>  <br>  I take it that you live with your dad or grandparents etc?|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Well, you have nothing to hide. But my mum was like this she would go through my e-mails and texts and her boyfriend is a computer nerd so he could back my account :(|`|GODp5htoaa	Thats weird. . . has she met them ? she might fancy them in a really strange way :)|`|tfdQxfrpaa	First of all I understand your mother having a feeling of panic that her child could possibly hiding something from her, HOWEVER, 13 year olds need to have their own secrets. Now, I'm not saying you should hide things from her, or be dishonest, but I do understand that a little privacy is required and needed equally. It sounds to me like she was acting a bit juvenile by hanging up on you and also demanding that you email the entire conversation. I hope that she can begin to understand that it is healthy for you to have a few harmless secrets and that you are still responsible and truthworthy.|`|SDVqRYZraa	Its not a little unreasonable its VERY unreasonable!<br>  I understand parents are paranoid and want the best for you ETC. but you need privacy, she has no right to pretend to be you or want to read your conversations. Its wrong!
b10aMPdOaa	Well put it this way, your playing a game of hockey and the baby needs seeing to.  Are you going to ask the referee to stop the game, Er hang on ref, the baby need feeding!   Get real.  If you had a real baby, you wouldn't be going to the hockey game, or you will need to get someone to mind the baby.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	People is a professional game, therefore he/she is watching it!<br>  <br>  I would imagine that they will let you take a fake baby past a metal detector, though it will probably set the detector off.  You might want to call ahead.<br>  <br>  Also you will have to bundle up the baby warmly (I think the newer ones detect temperature).  And of course if the baby cries you are going to have to take it out so it doesn't disturb people|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's a fake baby. I literally "killed" 2 of mine while in school. lol. Thank goodness I'm a better mommy to my real baby. I would just leave the stupid thing with your parents. I leave my baby with my mom to babysit, so I don't see why you can't hire a sitter for your little fake baby. Gosh I hated those things...lol...have fun.|`|xYv4dfVQaa	You should really call ahead for sure.  What are you going to do if you get there and they say no.  Maybe she will fit in your purse. Does the baby have metal that you would have to worry about a metal detector?|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	im sure it would be fine. i mean u gotta take care of it in order to get a good grade.
4vLt3SqFaa	Nipple stimulation works, however most couples fail to do it with enough force to cause biochemical release. (our midwife show us and it was REALLY firm pinching and pulling on the nipples but it worked when labor stalled)  It needs to be fairly firm (as in uncomfortable to a degree - sorry) and must last at least 15 minutes.Think of how newborn animals nurse - they nearly pull the poor teat of the mother animal and you get the idea.  Best  if grasped deep into the aureoles (less discomfort than on the very tip) and pulling away from the breast.  Use a combination of pinching, gentle twisting and firm pulling motions. Use a lubricant unless you really want to be sore afterwords, but not enough to make firm pressure impossible.  Also animal studies show the greatest uterine response to nipple stimulation is at least 15 - 20 minutes immediately post orgasm.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I ate spicy thai food and later that night had a good orgasm and POP! my water broke.|`|hoX7hoINaa	If you have begun to dilate, an RN told me that doing lots of walking and doing squat exercises in between helps to dilate further. Might work, might not, but worth a shot. Taking a bath also. A coworker said if you lose your mucous plug to have sex right after that. Unless you've already lost it? Or bouncing on an exercise ball.|`|zsvhAEQqaa	nipple and/or clitoral stimulation may help release oxytocin- which helps with contractions|`|HM0cxcahaa	Honestly if bub is not ready no matter what natural methods you take you wont go into labour...
1hciyvKdaa	Since most abusers do not ever stop the possibility of doing it again, and since grandma has stuck around, I would not have anything to do with them, he as the doer and her as the denier. Sad, sorry to hear that, theres too much stress and history for you, the kids wont wonder.|`|BG0z9rYOaa	Personally I would say cut it off completely.  Don't even understand truthfully why you'd even consider it.  If your Mother was in no way involved with this abuse and you wish for her to see this child I would arrange it for her to come to yours without him.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i wouldnt risk it unless it was completely supervised even then id feel uncomfortable|`|iMULlxdgaa	cut them off completely.
ca9dEvSAaa	Hey, I've been having braxton hicks since last week, and the 'poo' feeling for 3-4 days. I'm 38 weeks tomarrow and no baby. <br>  <br>  That could mean you are very close to labor, or nothing at all. Hopefully for both of us it means labor is within next week!|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	My 1st pregnancy i didn't feel the braxton hicks as strong as in this pregancy but my pre-labor started after i lost the mucus plug, a few hours later i was having mild contractions that escalated in intensity and closeness (about 5 minutes apart), that's when i went to the hospital, it took 8 more hours until my water broke and about 16 hours for my baby to come out after that, exhausting!!! Good luck!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	You aren't guna like this.... but I felt like that from 36 weeks until I had her which was at 39wk 4d. But hopefully it won't be that long for you hun!
LTD0qL6Yaa	With my 4th pregnancy i got a positive at 10 DPO, and i am 6 weeks preg now with # 5 and i tested everyday since 7 DPO but kept getting BFN's until 16 DPO. Thats when i got my first faint BFP. I had a supply of HPT's so i thought i would keep testing every 2nd day and with every test the line got darker, quicker. If AF doesn't show and you are have been getting negatives make sure you keep testing, you just never know. Good luck...|`|UMwrgxoYaa	With my last pregnancy I had my period on the 1st, sex on the 7th, <br>  ovulated on the 10th and had a positive on the 20th.<br>  <br>  So it was 10 days after.<br>  <br>  2 were inexpensive tests, one was Clearblue easy.

yGabEjDMaa	Sounds like you may be talking yourself into being pregnant.  There is a such thing called, honeymooners sex.  That's when you are having too much sex (I know, there is a such thing though) and you can get a bladder infection.  The pain could be from that infection as well.  I'd still get it checked out though.  Take a test too, if it will make you feel better.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Yes,you could be pregnant. Anytime you have sex you take that risk.|`|hY5JSbRBaa	If you had unprotected sex then yes you could be pregnant.<br>  The bladder infection can be caused from having a lot of sex. It used to be called "brides disease" for that reason. I get nauseous in the morning all the time... I'm not pregnant. Just hungary.<br>  You are young and crave and eat all sorts of yummy things, enjoy it while you can. :-)<br>  If you are really worried. Take a home pregnancy test. The First Response one has always worked well for me.|`|FIxo73Mdaa	You could be pregnant if you had unprotected sex since your last period.  The only way to really know is to take a test.  As for the bladder infection, I have had one or two before and have never been pregnant.  I have read that you can get them from increased sexual activity and from not going to the bathroom often enough (especially after sex).  Hope that helps.|`|bzQNHfunaa	sounds like u want 2 b pregnant. u are very young honey and take it frm me raising a kid at a young age is hard. i had my 1st @ 17. anyway now that ive preached..lol...yes u could be preg or could be over worrying..id wait a wk and take a test..remember u can always have false neg but not false pos!|`|AA11208683	you could be pregnant it sounds like you are...but everything is different with every women. i had bladder infections a lot before i was pregnant and i haven't gotten one yet being pregnant. if your periods arn't regular than i would suggest to wait like a week and take a home pregnancy test. and if you are patient just wait until you were suppose to get your period and take one a week after that. sometimes the best way if you really think you are is to go to the doctor... i only threw up in early morning. good luck!|`|GzpkA8HFaa	You could be worrying to much. Bladder infections are a type of urinary tract infection which is caused by bacteria moving up the urethra. Having intercourse and not peeing right afterward to flush any bacteria that may be lingering can cause the the infection. Also women are more prone because the bacteria don't have as far to travel.|`|xN11gIxUaa	You could be prego, or just be an eighteen year old girl. :) If you're really worried, take a pregnancy test or see a doctor.|`|00bc0e3e68b9f2e24d8a3f859bc6d095aa	Yes!I would get a preg test.Walmart has them for 3 dollars.The easiest and only way to know.
RwoN3E9Uaa	If a baby is actively nursing it is impossible for them to bite you.  If they start playing around then yes they can bite.  In my experience my daughter bit me once and it hurt but did not break the skin.  I said ouch and removed her from the breast.  She never bit me again and she now has two more teeth coming in.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Around five months or so, my daughter bit me. I actually screamed it hurt so bad! When my daughter heard, she gave me this look like she was sooo sorry she bit me even though she probably didn't know what she did. It was like she knew I was hurt. It never happened again. lol|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/bi...</a><br>  Will I need to wean when baby gets teeth?<br>  <br>  Many people think that when baby gets teeth and has the ability to bite, then the nursing relationship has ended and it's time to wean. Not true! If your baby is nursing properly, then you should not feel teeth, even if baby has a mouthful of them. And keep in mind that it's physically impossible for baby to nurse and bite at the same time, because the tongue covers the bottom teeth/gum when baby is nursing.<br>  <br>  Some babies never bite, but biting is a behavior that most babies do try, usually when they are teething. Rest assured that biting can be stopped with a little persistence on the mother's part. Biting is, for the vast majority of moms, a temporary issue that only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  All babies are different, so you may need to try several different things before you find something that works for you. What works for you will depend on your baby's age, temperament and personality.<br>  <br>  Many mothers have gotten through this stage and gone on to give their babies the wonderful benefits of breastfeeding for weeks, months, and even years afterward.<br>  Ways to PREVENT biting<br>  <br>     1. Biting at the end of a nursing session: Biting often takes place at the end of a nursing session when baby is getting bored and is no longer hungry. If you start to have a biting problem, watch for signs of boredom, and take baby from the breast before the biting starts. Also, watch for tension in baby's jaw before he starts to bite down. He may also pull his tongue back from it's normal position over the lower gum/teeth.<br>  <br>     2. When baby is teething: Biting can also be brought on by teething. If baby seems to be teething rather than wanting to nurse, offer her a teething toy or something cold to bite (instead of you). Offer baby a teething toy after a bite or "near miss." When you do this, tell her, "This is for biting. Be gentle when you nurse." See also these comfort measures for teething.<br>  <br>  <br>        When my oldest was teething, I could tell whether my baby felt like biting or nursing by offering her a finger (careful!) or a toy before nursing - she would either suck or bite.<br>  <br>     3. Biting at the beginning of a nursing session: If baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, make sure baby opens wide when latching on. If your teething baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, try giving her a teething toy or something cold to chew on before nursing. Praise baby when she latches on correctly, without biting.<br>  <br>     4. Distracted baby: When baby is distracted, don't force a nursing. If he's wriggling, rolling, or pushing against you with his arms, he may not be hungry or interested in nursing. Try lying down with him in a quiet room, walking or rocking. See also these tips for nursing distracted babies.<br>  <br>     5. Biting for attention: Focus your attention on your baby while nursing, if you're having a problem with biting. Some older babies will bite for attention. Paying attention will also help you to be aware of when baby is about to bite.<br>  <br>  Use positive reinforcement and praise for good latch on and careful unlatching. Even the youngest babies can learn to nurse properly when mom uses gentle encouragement.|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	oh gosh ouch. thats something i am not looking forward to.|`|DKfScL8taa	I was told by a la leche league person, that you gently flick their check and tell them firmly "no". If they continue to do it despite this. Stop feeding them, put them down, and try again later. I never did this because my son is 9 months and has no teeth and self weaned, but that is what they told me.
qFvHH6lUaa	You might want to get checked out just in case if you've had mirena in for a year and this is the first time you've felt this way.  I would think that you would have felt the different side effects by now.  Of course, if you haven't had a period in a while, you could just be feeling it more intensely.  Either way, call the doctor and get it checked out.  I have mirena and my doctor wants to see me yearly to check on it, so you should be going anyway.|`|yGabEjDMaa	Unfortunatley, I don't think anyone is going to be 100% in answering your questions.  All medicines have side effects, and some can take years to become present.  You are going to have to take a Pregnancy test to find out for sure.  Call your doctor too, tell them what you are having - my guess is, he'll ask you to come in for an exam.
7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	It depends on the doctor, really. Alot of people on here say they got one on their first visit (5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, etc) but my doctor only does two ultrasounds during the pregnancy unless any more are medically necessary and the first one is done at 12 weeks.|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	On the first prenatal visit, the doctor usually confirm the pregnancy with a blood or urine test.  On my second appt, they had to give me an ultrasound to estimate the due date.  Since I had irregular period, I was guessing how far along I was based on my symptoms.  It is more accurate to estimate the baby's due date when the fetus is measured between 10-17 weeks.  I was 11 wks then.  Otherwise, I heard they usually do it at a bit later.  My next one will be for 20 weeks to find out the gender of the baby.|`|yGabEjDMaa	I had an ultra sound right a way.   But that's because of of previous miscarriages.  Usually, they just measure your belly, weight, get you on pre-natals, and some times, the actual doctor won't even see you for a couple of months.|`|HkWTYhjDaa	i had my first ultrasound at four weeks with my first visit because im in high-risk. and have it done almost everyweek. Im in 18th week and already had 9 ultrasounds.|`|1o820L3Daa	Mine was at 12 weeks after my first doctors appointment. Then again at 20 weeks.|`|q5qdUvlgaa	My first ultrasound was at my first baby visit at nine weeks.  I got to see and hear my baby's heartbeat.|`|dR2bqUixaa	They did mine at 6 weeks, but it was only cuz they couldn't find the heart beat. My next one is March 31st. That's when I'm going to find out the gender. I'll be 21 weeks.|`|JreuGwJYaa	Yes its at your first visit I was about 7 weeks this time.|`|XzbRZCPUaa	MINE WAS AT 15 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN AT 20|`|e0xpYnv1aa	My first and only ultrasound was at 20 weeks, I go to a hospital on a military base and they only do one. My first prenatal appt. was a few weeks after I found out I was pregnant, I think around 9 weeks?|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	They usually don't want to see you until 8 weeks and after. <br>  My first appt was at 8 weeks and all he did was basically check me out (pelvic exam) and say yep looks like your'e pregnant! Then he did an ultrsound b/c we we'rent "exactly sure of how far along I was" hehe (I pretty much knew I just wanted to see my little peanut!)<br>  My first Ultrasound after that was at 19 weeks to find out the sex.<br>  That is the average time they can see the anatomy. 18-20 weeks.<br>  Although sometimes it is possible to see it before that they usually don't so them any earlier than 18-20 weeks.|`|CPwdVc4caa	Mine was at my first appointment, at 10 weeks; it was a really great shot too...you can see the little peanut perfectly.  I lucked out and got another one at my 14 week appointment too, since the baby was sitting really low and didn't want to let us hear a heartbeat with the doppler ;)|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	My first one was at 12 weeks and then my last one was at 20 weeks.  I won't be having anymore.|`|J2glFOkhaa	No it was my second visit. I was 8 weeks along, it was just a tiny bean!|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	I was 12 weeks far along|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Hi and congratulations! I am sure your son is so thrilled and hoping for a little brother !! :-) Doctors are sometimes different on when they want to see you for the first time and what they do. I will just tell you what my doctor does. He wants to see a patient between 6-7 weeks so that the baby is big enough to see on your first vaginal ultrasound. Also have your regular ole blood pressure, weight, health check and health history questinaire, and you may see the finance person to get your payment options and how they are going to file and when.<br>  Your big ultrasound about finding out the gender and checking out all the body parts and organs is between 18-20 weeks.|`|cSm1zod4aa	My first ultrasound was at 6 weeks, the day after I had 5 positive home pregnancy tests because I was cramping and went to the ER and they did one. They thought it was twins so had to have a follow up which happened at 13 weeks and then my doctor sent me for a dating scan which was at 20 weeks.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	With my first daughter, they did the ultrasounds at the office, so I had it that same day.  With this baby and a new doctor, they do the ultrasounds at the hospital, so it was 2 days before my first appointment with the doctor.|`|UgIOVl1jaa	I had my first at 6weeks cos they wanted to rule out an ectopic pregnancy due to severe cramping.  I'd say otherwise I would've had one done at 8weeks when I was scheduled for my first Ob appointment as my Ob does a scan everytime I see him.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	mine was my first visit to determine how far i was. it took me 2 weeks to get that apt after my + hpt and they said i was 4 weeks  then again at 12 and then 21 : ) congrats.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I had one at 8weeks - because they werent sure how many babies i was carrying (I looked at least 5months pregnant, and mulitples run in my family)<br>  <br>  But usually if all is going well you may not have one till 19-20weeks|`|YlLmAADraa	my first ultrasound was at 15 weeks then 23 weeks then 34 weeks.<br>  <br>  they will schedule an ultrasound when you go to your prenatal checkup.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	I've only had one ultrasound so far and it was when i was 18 weeks.
iMULlxdgaa	after 12 weeks or wait until you start to show.|`|GLJkGgloaa	I am a Nanny and I told my husband that I was going to tell them right away. I found out on a sunday that I was pregnant and told my Boss on tuesday. They were glad I told them so they could find proper childcare when I leave at 36 weeks prego.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	My pregnancy was very obvious straight away - i popped out by 8weeks (i looked 6months) so it was hard to hide. <br>  <br>  Alot of people wait till they are 12weeks - but if you have bad morning sickness it can be hard to hide. Tell them whenever you feel ready, or whatever is easier for you|`|IU4uNH97aa	When everything was for sure.<br>  Around 3- 4 months, you start showing more .|`|hoX7hoINaa	Wait until the 2nd trimester, in the case of possible miscarriage|`|BO28Mn8haa	wait until you start showing|`|sAbah6dTaa	i told them as soon as I found out... just because i feel they need to know so they can prepare, and hopefully gives me browny points for a paid leave... but it's up to you and when you feel it's time. =)|`|xiCQj8YTaa	the first 3 months are  the most scary and you don't show then, so wait until you are over the 3 month stage and you have your scan and then tell them, you might start showing at this stage too !|`|8zhFPCo3aa	right after i found out. (:
TBNaPkl6aa	I live in northeast Ohio, where it is always cold and snowing in the winter.  I have a 9-month old daughter, and my house is 70 degrees.  She's doing just fine.  She also sleeps in a warm fuzzy sleeper and blanket.  Unless your daughter's skin on the back of her neck feels cool, she's probably just fine.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	People on here don't know your baby, so they can't really help. We keep our apt at 60. She sleeps in a shortsleeve onesie and gown and kicks her blanket off. From when we first brought her home, she was like this. She hates being swaddled, won't wear a beanie or hand mits, and hates being over dressed. Even when we go out if she's in more than a long sleeve top, onesie, and pants she freaks out cause she starts sweating really bad. So I'm going to say to watch your baby and she'll give you signs if she's comfy. Feel of her chest, if it's comfy, then she's fine..if it's cold, she's cold...hot and sweaty, then she's hot. No one can give you a good answer to this cause every baby is different...but it sounds okay to me..|`|XVljoYZ5aa	A good rule of thumb is that babies need temperatures to be 5-10 degrees more than us. So if you are comfortable at that temperature, she probably needs warm pajamas and a warm blanket.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	How thick is this blanket? I hope its not a receiving blanket because that will be too thin!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Burrrr. You need to have her wrapped in a blanket all the time not just when she sleeps if your house is that cold. Get her a thicker blanket too when she sleeps a little one isn't going to do it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Feel the back of her neck and the top of her head.  Preferably with your lips or wrist (more heat sensitive).  If she's her normal temp then she's warm enough, if she's cool she's cold, if she's warm she's warm.<br>  <br>  Many babies get cold hands and feet, sometimes even when overheated.<br>  <br>  67-70 is a perfectly normal house temp.<br>  <br>  Every baby is different, what is enough clothes for one isn't enough for another.  She *may* need a hat, or gloves, or a sweater, or a grow bag.<br>  <br>  My first was always too hot, he needed one less layer than I did and never a blanket.  My second couldn't keep warm the first weeks and had to sleep on my chest with my both of us naked on the chest (usually him wearing an undone undershirt and pants, sometimes a sweater, and couple of warm blankets on us).
MHOxPs8Oaa	Quit being lazy and take the one minute to make a fresh bottle. You can encounter a bunch of problems if you leave it in there too long, how you heat it up etc...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i am assuming you mean the drop ins? it would be fine to put them in the fridge ready to go, just warm when you are ready; you can only make up 24 hours in advance...|`|miPubuDYaa	Yes you can. As per the info on the ready-to-feed bottles of formula - it needs to be used or thrown out after 24 hours open in the refridge.<br>  <br>  So if you wanted to make the bottles for the night and put them back in the fridge you will be fine. Those drop-in bottles are great! they have little holes so you can just run hot water over the bottles for about 2 -5 minutes (or enough time to warm them) and give them to the baby|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I have always made them a head of time, I use the Playtex Drop In system as well. I made 6 bottles a day and used them all in one day as well. They can stay all made up in the fridge up to 24 hrs. To warm them , either sit them into a container of hot/warm water for about 5 mins. or longer depending on how baby likes it.<br>  I actually am one that used the microwave to heat up bottles...its says not too, that is to save their butts ( company) if anything were to happen, like serious burns to baby or bursting in the microwave.<br>  Common sense will tell you to only heat for a short period of secs. for 8 oz, i did 30 secs. and that was it. warmed it up just a bit. Make sure to shake it so all gets well mixed ( hot spots & lumps) <br>  <br>  I know this was long sorry.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	You can. Just fill and place in fridge for 24 hours...no longer...heat them when baby needs. OR what we do with the drop ins, is we put however many scoops of formula we use in it, and set it to the side. When baby needs it, we use a measuring cup and put 4 oz(or however many you need) of warm tap water in the bottle. That way the bottles, set, we just add warm water, and go...no waiting to heat the bottle or anything. And yes, tap water is safe if you're in a good area...we even have a brita filter, but it's not necessary.|`|1h5RpINNaa	Yes you can, I think they have to be used within 24 hours of preparing them though.  It should say on the back of the formula can.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	Yes you can pre make them but it does state on the box not to mcrowave the drop ins (should not with any bottle but people do) to warm it up I would run it under hot water

N e way.<br>  Just say i never had sex with her.<br>  Honestly, just announce it, thats how i get rid of rumors.|`|rMgnmMN9aa	Wow your ex is a b*tch. That is horrible to lie about. Ignoring it was definately the right thing to do but laughing in her face and ignoring HER wasn't. That just pisses her off more! The rumor is already out there there's nothing you can do to change that, however if your not ashamed just explain to people that your a virgin and that's not possible, and if you don't believe me, just wait and watch her belly, it's obviously not getting bigger cause I didn't knock her up! On the other hand you might want to sit her down and talk to her, she obviously has major issues to do something like this, and I pray to GOD that she didn't get pregs by someone else so she can say it's yours. But if GOD FORBID it comes to that a simple DNA test will prove otherwise. So anyways, as long as your telling the truth in the end she'll look like the a*shole. Good Luck, sorry that happened!|`|1nMeOUnbaa	I think you should just try to ignore them.  As long as you and your friends know that's not true, who cares what everyone else thinks? I know it probably sounds easier than it actually is, but usually people just want to get a reaction. Tell them it's not true and that she's making it up and leave it at that. They will find out eventually that she's lying anyway. When everyone sees your ignoring it, they'll get bored and go on to the next gossip story. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  btw, you're really cute lol :)|`|N99ho6xxaa	Go up to her and be like<br>  <br>  stop, i dont know what your problem is, but i dont wanna be with it, the baby is not mine, so stop, now, im tierd of it<br>  <br>  and i think its cute your a virgin at 17<br>  <br>  :)|`|VSpdZEt8aa	ignore her n tell everyone dat u didnt do anything that could of had gotten her pregnant<br>  and by da way ur really cute!|`|J4fbG838aa	its awsome your a virgin =) and..<br>  she fvckin stupid and desperate for attention. she gona look even more stupid wen she dsnt have a baby. dont pay attention to her cus she and attention whore. and if she is accauly preggo and its not your kid then shes just a whore. but either way the sistuation is stupid and she needs to get over that fact that you guys arnt together and that the relationship is over.. just because shes peggo dsnt mean that you will take her back. and girls are stupid for thinking that just cus theyr having a baby guys are going to take them back. so obviously shes not that smart. so just tell people that ur ex is crazy and that shes not having your baby.<br>  <br>  also btw. your super hot!|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Ignore it she obviously wanted attention and she got it and if anybody asks you simply say no.|`|pJeFpC7qaa	haha wow this girl its crazy. She really wants some attention. Ignore it & it will pass. I'm sorry she's so crazy. If she's pathetic enough to spread a fake total false stupid rumor around, then let her be. I highly doubt she's even pregnant. Some girls just tell guys they're pregnant with their baby so that they'll come back to them (which is so stupid). <br>  <br>  & if you can't ignore them tell people its none of their Business even if its untrue. Or you could just totally confront this girl & tell her that you want this fixed right now <br>  <br>  :) lol sorry about that.|`|egqveuPjaa	Hmm well she's clearly insane...just say 'Sweetie, it's over. It's not me, it's you and your crazy ways.'<br>  Or, since she is clearly lying and I assume her parents don't know, I would call them and say 'I'm so sorry, I mean, we never thought....wait, she DIDN'T tell you?....' and then just hang up.|`|drI1vsJdaa	First of all, you're really hot! <br>  Second of all, she just wants attention.

Make A Scene In Front Of People.<br>  Demand She Goes To A Clinic And Gets Tested.<br>  Hmm..Being Talked About Sucks.<br>  Keep Ignoring The "Gossip".|`|kC37dRRIaa	Just know she is going to look like a dumb @SS whenever she doesn't have a baby. :P
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	Yes, I know a woman who got her tubes tied, but she got pregnant anyway. i guess what they say about no birth control method being 100% effective is true!|`|Coc593Ikaa	It is possible, but highly unlikely. From my research, the procedure is 99.95% effective. This leaves a 0.05% chance of getting pregnant with your tubes tied. This means that 5 in 10,000 such women will get pregnant each year.

This phenomenal absorption capacity is due to the absorbent pad found in the core of the diaper. This pad is composed of two essential elements, a hydrophilic, or water-loving, polymer and a fibrous material such as wood pulp. The polymer is made of fine particles of an acrylic acid derivative, such as sodium acrylate, potassium acrylate, or an alkyl acrylate. These polymeric particles act as tiny sponges that retain many times their weight in water. Microscopically these polymer molecules resemble long chains or ropes. Portions of these chemical "ropes" are designed to interact with water molecules. Other parts of the polymer have the ability to chemically link with different polymer molecules in a process known as cross linking. When a large number of these polymeric chains are cross linked, they form a gel network that is not water soluble but that can absorb vast amounts of water. Polymers with this ability are referred to as hydrogels, superabsorbents, or hydrocolloids. Depending on the degree of cross linking, the strength of the gel network can be varied. This is an important property because gel strength is related to the tendency of the polymer to deform or flow under stress. If the strength is too high the polymer will not retain enough water. If it too low the polymer will deform too easily, and the outermost particles in the pad will absorb water too quickly, forming a gel that blocks water from reaching the inner pad particles. This problem, known as gel blocking, can be overcome by dispersing wood pulp fibers throughout the polymer matrix. These wood fibers act as thousands of tiny straws which suck up water faster and disperse it through the matrix more efficiently to avoid gel blocking. Manufacturers have optimized the combinations of polymer and fibrous material to yield the most efficient absorbency possible.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper</a><br>  Modern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction[10], which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of cellulose pulp and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.checnet.org/healtheHouse/education/articles-detail.asp?Main_ID=554" rel="nofollow">http://www.checnet.org/healtheHouse/educ...</a><br>  The main absorbent filler in disposable diapers, sodium polyacrylate, could cause respiratory, as well as skin, irritations in occupational settings where exposures are at higher levels than occurs with diaper use. However, some studies indicate that super absorbent gels are not associated with skin irritations. Note that the gel used in disposable diapers today is not the same as that used in super absorbant tampons, linked with toxic shock syndrome, a number of years ago.<br>  <br>  Another study, conducted in Germany, looked at a small group of baby boys and found that those wearing disposable diapers had higher scrotal temperatures. However, it is not clear whether this had any effects on fertility. Another study found that scrotal temperatures in boys wearing cloth diapers with a protective cover were the same as those for boys wearing disposables. Cloth diapers worn alone were linked with the lowest temperatures.<br>  <br>  Most diapers, whether or not disposable, are bleached white with chlorine. As a result, there have been claims that diapers may contain trace amounts of dioxin, a highly carcinogenic byproduct of chlorine bleaching. Since the diapers come into contact with the genitals, some parents worry about potential reproductive cancers. Currently, there is no evidence that this is the case. See the next section for more on dioxin and diapers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Diaper-Not-Clear.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Diaper-...</a><br>  Disposable diapers are made from wood (cellulose based inside unit), chemicals (absorbent gel), and oil-based (polypropylene water-proof layer) materials. Some estimates suggest that 82,000 tons of plastic and 1.8 million tons of wood pulp (1/4 million trees) are consumed each year in the production of disposable diapers (4). However, wood pulp used in disposable diapers comes from tree farms operating for this purpose rather than forests or woodlands.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Urine and the absorbing material in the diaper.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	This pad is composed of two essential elements, a hydrophilic, or water-loving, polymer and a fibrous material such as wood pulp.

It is different for all women.  Some women ovulate on day 14 and other on day 21, for example.  All women are different and ovulate at different times of the month.

We had a fellow in the office named Campbell and everyone called him "soup". Adults can be cruel, too.<br>  <br>  For a girl:<br>  Scarlett Rae Is my preference.  But will people call her Scar"? Kids can be very cruel. She might want to go by Rae later; short and sweet.<br>  <br>  Graesyn Mackenna - too unique for me; the poor girl would have to constantly spell her name every time she gave it, a real pain. I know because I have to do that. And she might be teased by calling her "Sin".<br>  <br>  A name is an important thing to consider from all aspects.

I know of people who need they were pregnant right away. Don't torture your self with the "what if". Get a test done. A blood test from the doc is best. A home one can give a false negative (false positives are rare)|`|dVAiuqZCaa	Sorry but it sounds like your pregnant.|`|6EIhzsqoaa	My first sign of pregnancy was the tenderness in my breast.  Even my boyfriend noticed that my breasts were a lot more fuller.  You should go to the doctor & have them give you a pregnancy test.  You can do a home test, but doctor's is a lot more accurate.  I've never had pre-period symptoms.  Like some girls get real bad cramps or bloating.  I've never had that.  Do a home test if you want, but make sure you schedule a doctor's appt asap just to be safe.  Better to find out sooner than later.|`|sidUEhbjaa	why don't you go in for a blood test and check if your pregnant they can be able to check if your pregnant way sooner than urine. Or just go buy a pregnancy test. Your body can be reacting to your thoughts. Go to the Gyno or Planned parenthood a doctor can tell you by exam. and of course a preg test. If you don't want to get pregnant, use something no matter if it breaks the rhythm, its better safe than sorry and wondering about it later..|`|dbafItLvaa	There are pregnancy tests that can detect if you are pregnant up to five days before a missed period.  If I were you, I'd go get one of those and test just to ease your mind a little.  Be sure to test with your first urine of the day for the most accurate results. One word of caution, though:  that early, it would be very easy to get a false positive.  If you do not get your period by March 5, get another test and try again. Good luck!|`|roe07rI8aa	it could be either your period or pregnancy, you'll have to wait to find out. You could take a test now though because if you fell pregnant on 12th, the hormones should show by now regardless of when you think you are due.<br>  regarding the discharge, it sounds to me like you have thrush. this is sometimes connected with pregnancy but generally not. it is a yeast infection and can be brought on by a change in the balance of yeast within the body. your boyfriend might have it too. Go to the doctor together to get it sorted. treatment is simple.

EPaYoJaiaa	Don't kick the good son and his fiance out lord knows with this economy they probably won't make it. And they obviously have not done any bad to you so as a mother I agree with you on not kicking those two out (and anyone that would kick out their child simply because of age has no heart at all and has no business having children)<br>  <br>  But you DO need to put your actions where your mouth is. Kick the 20 year old that disrespects you and pays for nothing. He's an adult and seems to think he's acting like one, he needs to live like one. Keep the brother and the fiance and kick the son out. If need be call police, change locks etc. whatever you have to do. Also your heart will probably break, because even after all this he's still your son but with someone like that, it's time to cut them loose, some people don't grow up until they are forced to. Some never do. It's up to your son now.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	He's 20. Kick him out. You are just enabling him. I think you know what to do...|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You need to kick these kids out. You have an engaged couple living under your roof too? They need to go. Tell him he has three months to find a new place, and if he's not out on that specific date you're putting all his crap in the front yard and changing the door locks. STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. He only treats you like this because you've LET him. Kick him out before he's 30 years old and still living with you and treating you like garbage.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	He's 20 years old so you have no legal obligation to let him stay there. If he's being disrespectful and disruptive, kick his butt out of the house!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i don't see the need to kick out the 'good' son and his fiance, because as you said they are valuable in your home and they pull their own weight. i think the other one who wont' get a job or pay his bills is the one you need to kick out. he is old enough now that he should KNOW how to act! it's as simple as telling him 'listen, get a job and KEEP it, help around the house and pay your own darn bills or get out'. i know it's hard when it's your kid and you never want to leave them with no place to go but if you keep tolerating this behavior not only is it going to get worse but you are acting as his crutch and in essence you are letting him be a lazy bum because you are just giving into his behavior instead of putting a stop to it. and if he can't even respect you in your own home when you are helping him so much then  he needs to be taught a SERIOUS lesson.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	When he is out, pack his stuff up. Put a change of under-ware, some personal stuff, change of clothes, some cash into a duffel bag. Have the rest boxed up and either put into storage or stuffed into your attic.<br>  <br>  Put the duffel bag into the car. Then take your son, and the duffel bag, down to the the Marine Corps Recruiting station, toss them both out on the street, and be done with it.<br>  <br>  (Though if he pops pills the Marines probably won't take him either).|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Id give him 30 days to find a job and a new place and then id be changing the locks. At 19 i was out, married, and a my own child. Payed all our own bills and renting a home so there is no reason a 20 year old with nothing else needs to live in your home and treat you like this. If your other son is helping with bills and they are good kids and going to college no reason they cant stay. You are both helping each other out.|`|juU6nJqUaa	Sorry to say this, but at 20 he can move out and figure things out himself.  If the other young adults in your house are paying their own way and treating you with respect, why should this one think he doesn't have to.<br>  <br>  You don't owe him anything.  He needs to figure life out.  Sleeping on his dad's couch for a few months would be good for him.  Tell him to Take off.|`|frpCK0utaa	Kick your mooching son out. As for the other son and his fiance, i really dont see why you'd even think of kicking them out. They arent the ones causing drama.|`|dyFlOpYqaa	Kick them out. Especially the engaged couple. They are ADULTS now and should be able to care for themselves.|`|AA11537580	very simple solution!<br>  kick<br>  him<br>  out!|`|Aj99vuqYaa	As hard as it may be, you need to give him a strict deadline as to when he must have a job, as well as a deadline to when he must pay YOU back. Say, two or three weeks for the job. Two or three months for the paying you back (let him get some paychecks coming in). Don't let him use your car if you feel it's not a good idea, or charge him to use it. Make him buy the gas for it.<br>  <br>  I see NO need to kick the lovely couple out. And everyone else is stupid who said to kick them out when you clearly specified to not discuss that issue of kicking them out. They should live with you until they are done with school, get married or you see the time fitting, but be sure to alert them of when you're wanting them out of the house. No rush on them though, so long as they follow your house rules and pay their part.<br>  <br>  If your bothersome son doesn't do what you instructed when the timer runs out, tell him he's out of the house. Hold your ground. There is no law saying you must provide for him and be his slave when he's more than capable. Some of my cousins were 16 when they had their first babies. They worked and went to school and cared for themselves and their babies. They were 16! He is MORE than capable of taking care of himself, and if he refuses to move out, get the police involved. Change your locks and/or take away his house key. Take away the keys for your car that he's using. It will most likely be really hard to do this, but you must! He's going to only control your life for the REST of your life. You don't want that.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck and I hope that your son eventually learns responsibility and grows up.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	I know that as a Mom you can't see yourself kicking your son out, but you have to draw the line at disrespecting you.  Even if you are willing to tolerate everything else.  I also realize that he is going to use the excuse that "in today's job market there are no jobs".  True it is harder to find one, but he can look.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is like the people above me, you need to kick him out for your own good and his.  As for your other son and his gf, not a problem.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Ok..You need to quit ENABLING him to do these things.. Make him get a job...Make him pay you rent...Make him not have access to your vehicles.... PUT YOUR DAMN FOOT DOWN!<br>  I have a mother going through what you are going through with my own brother, she feels like she can not make him do these things for some reason...SAD really!<br>  Give him a certain amount of time to either show some responsibility or get out of the house. I know you will feel bad about it..He's your son, you can't just kick him out, what if something happens to him...<br>  <br>  Sometimes tough love is the hardest love to give...but also the most beneficial to both of you!

Good Luck!|`|Q31T93cTaa	If you were already supposed to start your period and you are typically regular, you can test NOW.  <br>  <br>  Usually they recommend using the first urine of the day, so that it's a bit more concentrated (as you have not been drinking fluids while sleeping) but if you are already ten days late, you could probably test anytime.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|xYv4dfVQaa	I think you should go ahead and test now.  Then if you are still spotting go consult your doctor.

xc6iCPUQaa	Just let parents kick her out and let her move in, she is a minor so if her paents kick her out they are the ones in trouble, not you. Also there are places pregant teenagers can go if they have no place to live.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	When does she turn 18?  He can't MAKE her abort....maybe you should tell her to go stay at a friend's house until she turns 18, or maybe you guys could present a plan to her father?  Thats probably hard, but worth a try.  I'm not sure, but isn't it not really statutory rape or whatever if you guys have less than a 2 year gap?  I think it would be rediculous for you to get in trouble for this situation.|`|vlnZXGu9aa	DOn'T RUN AWAY let her stay until she clears things up with her dad and ask the a again so people withbetter advice will see it|`|otinl2ucaa	run away.<br>  her dad has no right.

The reason being my friend in school was named Lana and we had a project where you right your name backwards and color it in.  Yeah they took them down once someone noticed it said ANAL with big flowers painted around it.  The other name in the class that came out bad was Naomi because backwards it is "i moan".  I don't mean to be rude by any means but I would have it if you didn't realize what it spelled.  Good luck hun|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Lana Ann doesn't flow well for me. I think the two names are just too similar Ann/Ana...plus Lana ends in A and Ann begins with A so the two A's just don't go well together.

The a on Lana runs into the A on Ann and the name only has 2 different letters in it. I like Alana better for a first name with a new middle name if you like the name so much. Plus Lana is anal backwards.<br>  <br>  Jayden Alexander is cute but to popular for me.|`|mR9ydwz5aa	jayden alexander is adorable, but i dont like lana ann as much. the first name is too similar to the middle name. is lana pronounced lane-uh or lawn-uh? actually i kind of like both, but i would go with a different middle name either way.|`|YfJHliLWaa	Jayden Alexander is nice but I don't like Lana Ann because it sounds funny.

xHlcnkgWaa	My son was the same and to be honest i tried everything and nothing worked he just kept waking up until he grew out of it.  He woke up about three times a night until he was about 12 months.  <br>  <br>  Has he got a night light, is he warm enough, is he hungry, is he too hot, try putting a layer of blanket under the head end of his cot sometimes they get congested from laying dead flat, is there a noise waking him like your heating coming on in the night.  It could be any of those things or he could just be like mine, just wasn't ready to go through the night.  Maybe when he is eating solids fully that might help.<br>  <br>  Good luck i know how horribly frustrating and tiring it is for you, mine is two nearly and still wakes in the night.  It's a lot better than it was though, you just have to ride it out xx<br>  <br>  Edit: I agree with Laura T, they sleep better when they've had more naps or are put to bed earlier.  I know it sounds ridiculous but it's true.  Maybe try and put him to bed half and hour earlier.  I noticed a huge improvement when i did that|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby slept through the night from about 3 months, but at 6 months, she started waking several times.  The doctor told me it was because she was becoming more mobile, and she'd wake herself up "practicing" arm and leg movements at night.  <br>  I tried swaddling her in a lightweight blanket, and it worked like a charm.  When swaddled, she would go right to sleep, and during the night, she would break out of the swaddle with her arms, but as long as her legs were swaddled, she'd still sleep all night.  I started just wrapping the blanket around her legs when I put her down.  She started sleeping all night again.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	He's hungry, boys don't change, we eat and sleep and fill diapers, we eat, we sleep, and fill diapers and we love our mothers, He probably is a little hungry, thirsty, and needs to know he's not all alone. babies don't have a night and day like us, he just needs some security(food, love warmth and a familiar voice or sounds) and lots of attention, don't worry you cannot over do the attention part, I still love my Mom!|`|hNIof0lbaa	Oh lord, I am in the same EXACT BOAT as you. Someone suggested to me that I need to have her nap more during the day so she will be tired enough to sleep thru the night... make sense?

Im going to keep an eye on this entry to see if anyone leaves you tips that I can try as well!|`|17b3Epjcaa	Every time your baby wakes during the night, you will need to repeat whatever you do to help him fall asleep for the first time each evening.

Sleep: what is normal at six months?<br>  Prof Care Mother Child 1994 Aug-Sep;4(6):166-7.<br>  <br>  In this study, part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC), researchers surveyed the parents of 640 babies. Some of the results:<br>  <br>      * Only 16% slept through the night at six months old -- 84% were not sleeping through the night at 6 months<br>      * 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times<br>      * 5% woke once every night<br>      * 9% woke most nights<br>      * 50% woke occasionally<br>      * 16% of six-month-olds had no regular sleeping pattern<br>  <br>   <br>  Armstrong KL, Quinn RA & Dadds MR. The sleep patterns of normal children.<br>  Medical Journal of Australia 1994 Aug 1;161(3):202-6.<br>  <br>  The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.<br>  <br>  What did they find?<br>  <br>      * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.<br>      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.<br>      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.<br>      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).<br>      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.<br>      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.<br>      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.<br>  <br>  Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.<br>  <br>   <br>  Scher A. A longitudinal study of night waking in the first year.<br>  Child Care Health Dev 1991 Sep-Oct;17(5):295-302.<br>  <br>  Abstract: A longitudinal study of the development of sleep patterns addressed the issue of continuity and change in night waking in the course of the first year. Mothers of 118 infants, who took part in a follow-up study of normal babies, completed a sleep questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Regular night waking was a common characteristic throughout the first year:<br>  Baby's age<br>   <br>  % babies waking at night<br>  3 months<br>   <br>  46%<br>  6 months<br>   <br>  39%<br>  9 months<br>   <br>  58%<br>  12 months<br>   <br>  55%<br>  <br>  The number of awakenings per night was a function of age. Following a decline in the number of interruptions from 3 to 6 months, an increase in night waking at age 9 months was recorded. Although the methodology does not lend itself to an objective validation of the changes in sleep-wake states, nor is it suitable for causal explanations, it is, nevertheless, important to note this profile. The increase in night waking towards the end of the first year coincides with significant socio-emotional advances which characterize this developmental stage.|`|VFfh1L2iaa	6 months, <br>  He may be teething, there is no age where children stop waking in the night,  but try teething gels like bongella ect, or there are teething dummies about.<br>  <br>  try putting him down more in the day, it could be down to him being over tired, if he has more naps in the day, it should be settling him.<br>  <br>  if he has a dummy to go to sleep on, put the dummy in and comfort him (rub his back ect) <br>  <br>  <br>  hope you find something x

U2N5kQmlaa	If your an unsuitable parent the court will have to say that he can have full custody.

The fact that you ARE worrying about it speaks volumes and Im sure you'll be fine. Your own upbringing will actualy make you a better mum, not a worse one....coz u know all the things you SHOULDNT do !<br>  Secondly. what your partner said to you about taking your children away if u dont come up to scratch is really cruel. What he should have done is reassure you as ur obviously feeling insecure but instead he played on this. I dont know enough about ur relationship to say but I think you should assess whether HE is gonna a be a good role model and a good partner in the long run? No, he cant just decide to take ur children and unless there was a very good reason, a court would not take a child from its mather unless she was some kinda child abuser or junkie so dont stress about it. I think you need to have a little more faith in yourself and dont take so much crap from everyone....and not only for yourself but for your baby...a. baby needs its mother first and foremost, before anything or anyone else so you have to be strong and believe in yourself for the sake of your baby....xxxx take care and dont worry so much.....enjoy your pregnancy and ur baby....dont let anyone spoil it for you with ridiculous comments and attitudes!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	He can only do that if you truly are an unfit mother, in which case you shouldn't have them anyway.<br>  <br>  I sincerely doubt this is the case, so no he can't do that. The fact that you are worrying about being a good mom means that you will be a good mom. No parent is perfect, we learn along the way.|`|08GDBedGaa	it's good you recognise and wish to not repeat!, it is very unsupported of your husband to react like this, you should talk about this further and communicate, communication is the a key element to a relationship, i came a cross this woman through another mummy site, perhaps you'd like to connect to her<br>  <br>  <a href="http://angelrodrigues.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://angelrodrigues.weebly.com/</a>|`|PbBWJGsTaa	I'm assuming he was joking.  Even then that is something that he should have never ever said to you.<br>  <br>  If you're aware of the reasons your own mother had problems raising you, thats likely to mean that you can avoid the same problems.  You will probably be a better mother because of it.<br>  <br>  No he cannot judge that for himself. If he honestly thought you were doing something very wrong in the raising of your child, that warranted having the child removed from you, he would have to prove this to a court during the divorce proceedings.  You say he is your partner?  So he's not your husband?  Then there wouldn't be any divorce proceedings anyway.<br>  <br>  A judge has to decide if you are an unfit mother, and you have to be a very unfit mother to have a baby taken away from you.  So as long as you're raising your baby as best you can, you have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  What a ridiculous and uncaring thing for him to have said.|`|b10aMPdOaa	I'm sure you will be fine.  I bet you won't make the same mistakes as your mother.  As for your partner, did he say this jokingly or was he for real?  I know whether he said it jokingly won't matter to you, but, you need to find this out.  Sit him down and speak to him again.  Good Luck<br>  <br>  EDIT.  Unless you are mistreating your child/ren then don't worry, he won't be able to take the child/ren away from you.  Like I said, I'm sure you won't make the same mistakes as your own mother.  You will be a good mother as you are concerned already.|`|irks23HXaa	I think he is winding you up , just take what he said like a pinch of salt enjoy your pregnancy , you will probably be a great mother your just wanting things to be different which Im sure they will be, so stop getting yourself in to fluster, when this baby arrives your mothering instinct will take over and no he just cant take your children away from you its not that easy .  good luck|`|AuVtUjVAaa	First off you will be a great mom. If you know that your mom was aweful and don't want to turn out like her, than you will probably do things differently than she did. Which means you won't be an aweful mom because you know the mistakes that your mom made. As for your partner, I can't believe he would say something like that. He should know that both of you will make great parents. it's all about learning as you go. I don't think anybody is really fully prepared and knows everything when having a baby. Congrats and Good Luck
3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	I highly suggest you get away from him. He has two kids with this woman and spends the night at her house. <br>  <br>  If I had a son and wanted to see him then I would have him come stay with me on weekends or spend the day with him and go home in the evening.|`|7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	No that's not normal unless his child was sick or his expecting ex wife/partner was some how sick like in bed rest or something similar. It's also not normal for him to have kept her pregnancy a secret from you for 5 months. I would just move on I smell a lot of drama around the corner especially when the new baby arrives. It will just give him an excuse to spend more time with her.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	ok me and my ex would never do this<br>  <br>  1)complete lack of respect to his gf who i adore as shes great with my daughter if that had to happen she would come along too no probs<br>  <br>  2) confusing for the child is mommy and daddy together are they not, etc <br>  <br>  3) come now hun you are being played sorry but that is not normal in my eyes|`|VXhOLgDEaa	If you were one of my best friends...I would tell you...to leave him.

He sounds like an awful person to me.<br>  <br>  He should be staying with his family, acting like a dad, and trying to work things out with them. He obviously was still in love with her 5 months ago or he wouldn't have been still sleeping with her.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	You choose to stay with him after finding out. If you dont like it that he has an obligation to his kids then find someone who doesnt have children.

WPI0Z47saa	Yes it can. You cannot take anything with asprin. You can only take tylenol for headaches. The first 3 months are the most important so if you think that you may be pregnant you need to stop taking that stuff now.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, I am pregnant and I suffer for horrible migraines at least once a week and I know that tylenol doesn't do anything for them, but you just have to deal with the headache. The baby is more important.|`|cSm1zod4aa	Read the label. If it says do not take while pregnant, then there ya go, if it says to ask your doctor, then do that. But really the only thing safe during pregnancy is tylenol. good luck!|`|yGabEjDMaa	They say what you do to your body even 6 weeks before you conceive can have an impact on your baby.  As for not knowing if you are pregnant, you need to either take a test or go to the doctors.  Your body can trick itself into thinking it's pregnant, sometimes when you are wanting nothing more than to be pregnant.  Good luck!|`|bzQNHfunaa	DO NOT TAKE EXCEDRIN!!!!! if u are preg it is NOT I REPEAT NOT OK!!!! the caffeine in it (unlike caff in sodas) is alot highger and in 1st trimesters and last trimesters can hurt possibly kill ur baby..thats what my dr tells me. i 2 was havin bad headaches and took it a few x's. i  developed a bleed between my placenta and uteran wall that later corrected after i quit takin excederin!|`|95b08c96cc8082f81aedcdfa3f5f6e45aa	You would def. have to check with yoru Dr. I know its not good to have asprin while your prego... but i think you need to check with your Dr to be the most safe!
C55pji5Qaa	Absolutelyy if it with are reputable Reproductive Endocrinologist.Yes their should be rules and limits but IVF is not playing God.God gave us intelligence and we should use it.If it is not meant for someone to have a child not IVF or anything else will work!!!!It is unfortunate that only the bad cases are heard of.Unless one goes through infertility they have no right to judge because they don't know how they would feel.<br>  Designer Babies-NO.DNA testing for medical ailments(which I agree with) is different than picking for eye color etc....BTW,most fertility clinics won't even let you pick the gender so it is not that common!|`|723QHuicaa	In terms of eliminating fatal or disabling conditions - yes.<br>  <br>  In terms of making sure you get a blue eyed, blonder haired child - no.|`|sk46uigvaa	Yes because some couples have a hereditary gene which can cause certain diseases etc which is only passed down to boys, so in order to have a healthy child they need 'designer IVF' to have all girls.<br>  <br>  If it's just to produce twins or certain sexes then no that's just greed.|`|hqogf9oGaa	First things first, I am not 100% sure why you are referring to the term "designer babies" and IVF together as the two are not one and the same.<br>  <br>  The term designer babies refers to actually choosing characteristics that a child would have such as hair colour, eye colour, height etc which I do not agree with at all.<br>  <br>  IVF in itself is a treatment for those who suffer from infertility (like my husband and I) and I whole heartedly agree with it's use.<br>  <br>  Aside from these two there is also genetic screening which is used to eliminate the passing on of hereditary diseases and, as in recent media coverage, a baby has been born without the gene which can trigger breast cancer after the child's family lost several generations of his family to the disease.  In these circumstances I agree with the treatment.<br>  <br>  Wishing you luck with your school work.<br>  <br>  Indigo|`|WxqeMSw7aa	No way, wheres the fun in that ?<br>  <br>  Edit : who got no ba**s on here ? why the thumbs down ? its a legit answer.

Is it asking whether people agree with designer babies or whether they agree with IVF.  IVF offers the chance of having a family to many people suffering from the heartbreak of infertility (which if people have not experienced they frankly cannot be qualified to judge on) but does NOT offer a "designer baby".  <br>  <br>  Some clinics in some countries do offer screening and donor selection which can lead to what I assume you are referring to as designer babies.  This is not allowed in the majority of countries and is a totally different matter.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, yes I wholeheartedly agree with IVF, but do not agree with it being used for the creation of "designer babies".<br>  <br>  Good luck with your school project - anything that can educate about the realities of infertility is in my mind a good thing, but I hope your project has not been set on a misleading topic...<br>  <br>  Nic|`|03c22ee76cbad52a4b0a40b6fab23c49aa	No. The Western world is so overrun with science and technology that even the most natural thing in the world....which is having a baby....has turned into some freakish science experiment now....with IVF and choosing a baies sex and eye colour etc. It actually makes me sick to think about it.

She should be going back in two weeks for a check up at the clinic she got it done at.<br>  <br>  And actually it wouldn't be considered a "baby" because if it was small enough to be legally aborted it would be considered an "embryo".<br>  <br>  More importantly, why is it any of your business?<br>  <br>  EDIT: JohnnyRico - If you were incharge thousands of women would die in back alleys every single day because you took away their freedom to control their own reproductive organs in a safe and medically certified enviornment.|`|c01987f2cf9d98f28a9958d69b66ea7faa	First, why do you NEED to believe her or not?<br>  <br>  I am not certain, but I would THINK until the fetus is of a viable age.

7PivTe5yaa	Some of the information already provided isn't exactly correct.<br>  <br>  When a man is a carrier he will pass the fragile X "pre-mutation" to ALL of his daughters, all of his daughters would be "CARRIERS" and would be at risk of passing on the full-mutation to their children (males or females). When a man has a son, he passes on his "Y" chromosome and Fragile X is "X-linked", he cannot pass it on to his sons. For more details go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fragilex.org/html/change.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fragilex.org/html/change.htm</a> (read Fathers to sons and daughters.<br>  <br>  The Your Genes Your Health provides a non-technical explanation of fragile X. <br>  <br>  The Genetests.org site is much more technical, with a great deal of research references.  <br>  <br>  Other reputable sites are listed below as well.|`|cf9ae0f89a594d9500ac4952aa3df5b5aa	I haven't the foggiest idea what fragile x is, never heard of it. But I remember learning about dominant and recessive genes in school. Some things can only be passed through the female, like male pattern baldness, and other things. The reason is because the sperm doesn't carry as much information as the female egg does, sperm travels light. Although, the sperm is what decides whether the baby will be male or female. Now, lets just say HYPOTHETICALLY that fragile x can be inherited from the mom AND the dad. In your scenerio the father exhibits fragile x, whatever that is, and mom does not exhibit. Just because mom doesn't exhibit it does not mean she isn't a carrier. That means, she does not have fragile x, but she has the gene to pass to her offspring and they might have it. So if she's a carrier, and dad exhibits fragile x, then each offspring would only have 25% chance of not exhibiting it, or becoming a carrier. I may not have done that right, I'm not a scientist. But make a chart, for the father, X for the dominant gene of fragile x which is what causes him to exhibit, and a small x in case one of his parents gave him a gene that has nothing to do with fragile x. Now mom, x for no fragile x, but x* for the carrier gene for fragile x. When you fill in a 4 box chart, only one square ends up xx, Which means the child is neither a carrier, or even has fragile x. But the other three boxes end up Xx meaning they'll exhibit, Xx* where they exhibit and they got mom's carrier gene, and x*x where they just carry. Anyway, the only thing you can hope for I guess is that the sperm doesn't pass fragile x, and mom isn't a carrier, otherwise, your chances of having a child without fragile x is slim.|`|avkZGv1taa	A man with a fragile x chromosome will always transmit it to their daughters, but never to their sons--so you would have a 50% chance of the child having the condition.  Are you sure your friend has the condition?  <br>  These are some of the characteristics/symptoms according to Wikipedia:  Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testicles in men (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Speech may include cluttered speech or nervous speech[7]. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness and limited eye contact. Some individuals with the fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism. Most females experience symptoms to a lesser degree because of their second X-chromosome, however they can develop just as severe symptoms.<br>  Edit:  After reading some of the other responses I thought I should clarify.  A man will always pass the affected X chromosome to his daughters because he only has 1 X chromosome to give--so ALL daughters will get that one.  NONE of his son's will inherit the trait because their X chromosome will come from their (presumably?) unaffected mother--they will only get a Y chromosome from their father.  Fragile X syndrome is a DOMINANT genetic disease, therefore only 1 defective X chromosome needs to be present in order for the person to have symptoms.  So, daughters could show symptoms--and, they have a 50% probability of passing the condition on to their children (male or female).  Hope that helps.|`|QNRB0gBQaa	Unlike other X-linked genetic disorders, both males and females can be carriers of a Fragile X mutation. A carrier is an individual who carriers an altered form of a gene which can lead to having a child or offspring in future generations with a genetic disorder. We are all carriers of three to five gene mutations, many of which are "silent;" it is only through genetic testing that we know which ones we carry. Some genes are on the non-sex chromosomes which are the same in males and females and some are on the sex chromosomes, namely the X or Y chromosome. <br>  <br>  The gene for Fragile X (the FMR1 gene) is on the X chromosome and therefore fragile X syndrome is called an X-linked genetic disorder. Often in X-linked disorders only females are carriers and only males are affected. However, in Fragile X both males and females can be carriers (and both males and females can be affected).<br>  <br>  --------------<br>  Summary<br>  --------------<br>  He has fragile X, you don't.<br>  There is a 50% chance the baby in question could CARRY it.<br>  <br>  *Only males actually get affected by the disease.<br>  <br>  You may be carrying it and not know* fyi.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If the baby is a boy *50% chance*<br>  There is a 50% chance he will have the disease.<br>  <br>  If the baby is a girl, she will not show symptoms of fragile x, but MAY STILL CARRY THE DISEASE.<br>  <br>  All in all,<br>  <br>  There's a 25% chance that the boy will have Fragile X.<br>  There's a 25% chance the girl will CARRY fragile x, but not show diseased-like symptoms.<br>  <br>  There is a 50% chance that the baby will be completely fragile x free.<br>  <br>  as far as my knowledge goes<br>  <br>  ~Heil~
1835675395f22fc2dabd44ad87bb6ac9aa	You poor girl, this must be really worrying for you.<br>  First of all I COMPLETELY disagree with justpapi, returning violence however mild just shows your child that it's ok to hit/bite/whatever because mummy does it too. With my first child we tried spanking as a means of discipline and he just started hitting us back, as soon as we made the conscious decision to stop, so did he.<br>  I have a feeling that this might be all about attention. Don't get me wrong, I know how hard it is to share your time between children, especially when one (ie a newborn) can't physically manage without you, Your son has undergone as big an upheaval as you have with the birth of the new baby and it does take time to bond as a family unit.<br>  At 4, he doesn't yet have the necessary communication skills to let you know exactly how he feels and as with most boys his age he is much more likely to show it through his actions.<br>  At the moment it sounds like he's figured out that hurting his new sibling certainly gets him attention (as strange as it seems to adults even negative attention works for kids) especially if you sit down and question him about his reasons.<br>  I don't know what support you have but if at all possible I would try the following.....<br>  1. Spend a day with him. Get someone (Daddy/Nanny etc.) to look after the baby for a whole day (preferably from the night before until after he's in bed) reconnect with him, remind yourself how lovely he is and don't even worry about or discuss the issue, HAVE FUN!<br>  2. This is a tough one, try to consciously put him first for a day. I know this is a big ask with a newborn but try to play with him/do an activity with him with the baby in the background and if the baby cries/needs you for something try to let him see that the baby has to wait a minute for your attention because you are busy with him (not sure if this sounds cruel but as long as the baby is safe and you don't leave it too long(!) it can work wonders on a childs self-esteem) even positive language like "oh *lucy* I'm having such fun playing with your big brother, I'll be with you in a minute" can make a big impression on a young child.<br>  3. And this one is even tougher but please remember it's only while he's around....for a little while try to pay less attention to the baby.<br>  Obviously care for him/her as necessary but keep the main focus of the attention on your eldest and put the baby down when his/her needs are met and go back to your eldest.<br>  <br>  If all this sounds a little harsh on your newborn try not to forget that at 3 months they're more interested in eating, sleeping and pooping than what's going around them! And hopefully it won't be for long.<br>  <br>  For the time being, while you're dealing with all this, maybe try to keep the baby out of his reach, in a playpen/ in a safe seat in the middle of a big table, to take the temptation away from him.<br>  I think it's a little early to worry about any potential behavioural problems but if none of this works and you are happy in yourself that you've tried consistently to improve his behaviour in a positive manner then a visit to your healthcare provider might reassure you.<br>  <br>  I hope at least some of this might be of some help to you and your family, good luck to you xxx|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	really i think he may need to see a doctor  ,,, my little g/son was like that ,, he was told he had mild austim ,,,  good luck|`|3QkVoT2kaa	If possible get someone to look after your baby and spend some quality one to one time with him.

It is for his own good at the end of the day, and if in the future his behavior continues to the point where he is  teenager, the problems you are having now will be a lot harder to handle and maybe looking back, one smack on severe occasions may not have seemed like a bad idea. Everyone I know that was smacked lightly as a child has turned out without any behavioral issues, and I think there needs to be more discipline in society in general. Children were given the ruler in school and think how much more disciplined (i know this is a generalization) this generation is. I was smacked as a child, on severe occasions where I was way out of line and I hit my brother around the face due to jealousy, and now I have grown up to be caring, respectful and responsible. It does seems like your son is in need of attention, seeing as there is a new baby around- there was a similar situtaion when i was younger- there is 22 months between my younger brother and I, and when he came along, I apparently used to shake him after he had just gone to sleep, and I went through a period of constant attention seeking. I think that this has been quite a change for your little boy- he is used to having your undivided attention and now that has changed for obvious reasons. I wouldn't worry about him having ADHD or any form of attention disorders just yet. <br>  I know smacking seems cruel, but a light smack on severe occasions is a lot better than having a potential lifetime of behavioral issues. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I haven't offended anyone xxxxxxxxxx
CdJtH0xdaa	Hello!<br>  I am a nineteen father to an almost two-week old.<br>  I assume you are keeping the baby, as you are asking how to be a good father.<br>  Well, I can tell you that being a teenage father, especially at sixteen, will NOT be easy.<br>  I think that you will be able to interact better with your child as he/she grows up, because you will still be young, so you'll know how to play with your child.<br>  There really is no way to be a good teen-aged dad. Just be there for your child, love your girlfriend, work and go to school.<br>  I hope I've helped.<br>  Good luck|`|vOFdHvlvaa	If u and her are planning on keeping the baby, then helping out takin care of him/her, helpin paying for stuff (babies are expensive), and basically just generally being there for both ur girlfriend and the baby.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.<br>  <br>  If u ever need to talk feel free to email me, i'm a teen mom who's son is almost 9 months old and i he has a great daddy  (who's also a teen), so i may be able to help out with any specfic ?'s u might have.|`|EIzs2OWeaa	Awww! Just be yourself. Smile alot, spend as much time as you can with the baby. Congrats and have a nice life!|`|3w7VztEWaa	Juts be loving ask to help her and just love and play with your baby..<br>  Thats all babies need is lots and lots of lovin.|`|byXx3o1oaa	Well assuming that you two have decided to raise the baby, there are several things that you can do to become a good father. Age doesn't define how good of a parent you are. You need to first get a job so that you can help pay for the baby (formula, diapers, clothes, etc.). Always be there for her no matter what, you need to go to the doctors appointments with her and be part of the pregnancy. After the baby comes its going to be difficult but you have to stick with it and take things one day at a time. Since you're only 16 you need to stay in school, you've probably heard it a million times but it really is the best thing for not only your future but also those of your girlfriend and unborn baby. Last of all you need to support her with everything throughout the pregnancy and delivery. This is new to both of you and it'll make it easier if you're both on the same page and going through it together. Good luck and Congrats on the baby!|`|UZ2mMaS5aa	heres a list<br>  <br>  1) Get a job, doesnt have to be great but enough to buy clothes formula and diapers and dont forget the wipes.<br>  <br>  2) DO NOT run away she will get you for child support QUICK.  Also you dont want to walk arround the rest of your life knowing that there is a child without their father because you were chicken sh*t.<br>  <br>  3)  STAY in school, yes I know youve heard it a gazillion times but Ill say it again.  Life is difficult enough even with a HS diploma.<br>  <br>  4) See what the state can offer yall, your going to need it.<br>  <br>  5) Stop going out at every chance you get to smoke and drink, its not worth it in the long run.  Im not saying stop smoking but if she cant why should you be able to?|`|nQ30vT4Eaa	always ALWAYS be there for her, no matter what happends its up to you and her together to give that baby a good and normal life if you plan on keeping it. No matter how extreme the situation gets NEVER BACK OUT. Remeber its your baby too, and you should want the best.|`|FG75AjcRaa	at least you care and ur not gonna walk out on her... just support her and help with the baby, expenses for the baby, and everything, and u should be okay|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	1. Marry your girlfriend.  Otherwise, you will have no rights to the child whatsoever.  You would have to go to court, to get an expensive paternity test, just to prove you are the father, if you don't marry her.<br>  <br>  2. Go with her, to all the monthly pre-natal exams.<br>  <br>  3. Buy the book 'What To Expect When You're Expecting'.<br>  <br>  4. When she starts treating you like HE**, as a result of the pregnancy, remember that it will be over when the baby is born.|`|nLdSwOQLaa	well u didnt just leave her, so i think ull b a great teen dad.<br>  no one can really tell u how, just b the kind of dad you would want.<br>  <br>  good luck :)!
cnIzqEoDaa	Sometimes birth control may cause your period to act funny and make you spot. The chances of you being pregnant are slim, but there is still a chance. If your period doesn't show in a few days, take a pregnancy test. Good luck.|`|c01987f2cf9d98f28a9958d69b66ea7faa	Yes, you may have some light bleeding, and it doesn't mean you are pregnant.<br>  My concern here is that you use the withdrawal method of birth control even with you being on the pill. Darling' withdrawal means NOTHING when it comes to conception. Even if your boyfriend has "precum" on him and he gets it anywhere near your vagina, you CAN get pregnant. If you are on the pill, your chances are low that you will get pregnant, but, you need to know a couple of things, Yes, there is a failure rate for the pill. NOTHING but total abstinence can guarantee that you WON"T get pregnant. Every time you have sex, you are open to a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The other thing that really bothers me, is that you use ONLY the pill. The pill may work well for preventing a pregnancy, BUT, not using a condom as well as the pill leaves you and he open to some nasty bugs out there. Chlamydia, Syphilis, HIV, AIDS, genital herpes. you are not protecting yourself from that is you don't use a condom as well as the pill.<br>  As I told my son's when they became sexually active, get used to using a condom, it's mandatory these days, to protect yourself, your lover, and society.<br>  Make those boys use a condom. If they won't, or give you a sob story about how they can't *** with one on...too bad...you will NOT be having sex with me then.
cnIzqEoDaa	The website says that starts working right away.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Highly doubtful! It takes about 24 hours for it to get through ur system. I used depo for years. If you still want to test fine. But it will say negative!!
qxnZXOVFaa	heck yes!  get a test and if you are pregnant get to the doctor!|`|uuceuyRyaa	yes there is a chance, but it's rare, your prolly not pregnant, but take a test if you still think your pregnant|`|gTErwGmMaa	there could be but most people miss it!|`|dR2bqUixaa	It is possible. My mother had her period all nine months of being pregnant with me and my twin brother. Take a test.
Pf9fyEyQaa	Maybe they just can't imagine how hard it would be to have twins.  I think it should be happy news!  Although it's a scary time it's also really joyous and there is no reason not to be excited about it! :)|`|abT0o6hHaa	Some people think that because they couldn't handle 2 babies at once (emotionally or financially) that no one else can either. I think it would be amazing to have twins! Its not something I want to try but I think its still cool|`|cJQL64ylaa	I think they are reflecting their own limitations when they speak like that.  They don't think they could cope and therefore they think that anyone else would be the same.  I was absolutely over the moon when I found out I was expecting twins and now I have 2 beautiful 5 month old girls I couldn't be happier.  So many people just say something along the lines of "oooh, double trouble, how will you cope" which I think is so sad.  <br>  <br>  I had someone last week stop me, admire the girls and then say "double the joy - how lovely"!  I could have kissed her I was so happy that for once someone didn't make any negative comment at all!<br>  <br>  Yes, I'd be lying if I said it's not hard work, but it's not THAT hard and it's worth all the effort and I wouldn't have it any other way!<br>  <br>  Nic x|`|1tmX7xbRaa	maybe cause most people don't feel they can't handle two babies at once. i don't think i would be able to handle having twins and i say god bless anyone who does! but i think that's probably the reason just because so many people know how hard it is to take care of one baby let alone two.|`|zSABr7praa	I was measuring high at 14w5d so they did an ultra sounds, they nurses exact words were "LETS HOPE IT'S NOT TWINS!"  I know she didn't mean it offensively, I just anyone who's had one child knows how difficult two would be.|`|roe07rI8aa	Usually it's the OMG response. Once you have had one at a time, you realise how hard it must be to have two together. that's all. i don't think its any more than that.|`|3q2Uo6Whaa	Probably jealousy.  Deep down inside they wish they could be blessed with 2 also.
CdJtH0xdaa	I don't think this is a real post, as you grossly misspelled "daughter"|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Ground her!!!|`|nLdSwOQLaa	if ur really that worried, take her 2 talk 2 someone. <br>  i doubt shed really kill herself 4 that reason, shes just craving attention.<br>  <br>  ps. i feel bad 4 ya, evryone on here pounces on evry little mistake, u misspelled one word big deal. y would u evn lie about something like this?|`|l1STgPyRaa	if you have state health then take her to the local mental health word and have them deal with it!<br>  <br>  but more then likely she is playing for attention and nothing will come of it.<br>  <br>  but i do wonder if this is a real question too, but oh well if it is there is a answer that might help, if not then maybe you should use the information as you need help to be thinking of such a horrible thing to ask|`|AA11296427	Troll, much?<br>  <br>  :]|`|8oKazGVGaa	shes only saying it for attention don't worry too much|`|ZWUBlIfoaa	um troll, u cant even spell DAUGHTER!|`|cbEOXkugaa	Crawl back under your bridge troll.|`|TQoB76FDaa	I dont think this is a real question<br>  <br>  get a life
apSTH4TIaa	Let him have it.  I don't believe in video games making people violent.  I have 2 boys who love video games.  They are 10 and 11.  My boys do not swear, or hit others or hurt others because they play video games.  They are smart enough to know it is a game and that the things they do on the game they cannot do in real life.  It is just a game.  It is a great tool to use whenever the grades aren't good because I can take it away and it actually hurts them to be without it so then they do the work.  They have gone a full 9 weeks with no games because of a bad report card before and it had NO effect on thier behavior.  They didn't seem more or less violent while playing the games.  I like it because taking away his educational hand held doesn't phase him because he loves this game.  Plain and simple you have to decide that based on your child.  If your child is prone to violence then maybe its not a good idea, but if he understands it is just a game then I don't see any harm in it.  It can be pretty fun.  You should play it with him.  I do.|`|roe07rI8aa	I would wait until he's older - he's about to enter puberty so he may change p[ersonality overnight anyway. you don't want to be blaming yourself because he had a comp game at the wrong age if anything does go awry! good luck.|`|cNzCIRYRaa	i wouldn't really<br>  the game can get real bloody (i.e. heads blowing off with blood flying)<br>  there is also a lot of bad language<br>  wait till he's like 13 or older|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Not necessary violent, there is allot of fun in playing games, but you have to watch out for addiction and watch the number of hours your child plays each day. Here is a story I have posted before. I hope it will bring to every parents attention how addictive these games can be.<br>  <br>  Children become addicted to Video Gaming and T.V.<br>  It is really like drug addiction. They get hooked and live in the world of gaming. Gaming becomes their identity.<br>  I like many parents over looked this. My neighbours son, went missing after his parents took away his Xbox 360 on Thanksgiving day here in Canada. Brandon had become addicted to the game Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.<br>  He missed a day from school sneaking home, when his parents were at work to play the game. His parents took the game away, he found it and got caught playing it when it was grounded. <br>  So it was then taken out of the house for good. His parents did not know they had just taken away his whole world and his indentity. Brandon ran away that afternoon and searchers looked for him for 3 weeks. His body was found by hunters in a wooded area a few miles from his home. He had fallen from a tree, we think he climbed it trying to see the lights of the town and find his way back home.<br>  Sadly, Brandon is just one of many that have been addicted. Parents should all read about Brandon. Type in Brandon Crisp Barrie Ontario Canada on your computer.<br>  Read the sad story and look at Brandon's picture. Now decide if this beautiful child, who was so addicted died for a reason. The reason we think, was to bring to every parent the seriousness of Video Gaming addictions.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Barrie Ontario Canada )|`|RI1brp91aa	My cousin is 11 and she is very mature. She doesn't swear and she doesn't talk about 'bad stuff'.  Her dad let her start playing world of warcraft when she was nine because he knew she could handle it. =) . She's just the same too, she doesn't swear or anything. i don't see what's wrong.
PLgNsOF9aa	Just realize that everything isnt always gonna be happy and merry but what is really important is that you both really love each other and the child you made together. Even when the going gets rough you got to stick it thru and hang in there and then it will smooth out. You are both different individuals so you cant expect to get along all the time. But you can stick with it and not blame one another when you argue. Love is hurtful and wonderful both. DOnt listen to what other people say , stick with your woman and your baby and be the man you want to be for them.  This is an immensely wonderful time in your life and you will need each other a lot in the next several months as you learn and adjust to your babys needs. Things may get stressful when the baby cries and you dont know why and all that but just stay calm and help out one another and give each other breaks.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	just cause someone says that a relationship won't last doesn't make it so. that should give you the drive to make the relationship work. and if the relationship does end the child support maybe something that comes out of it. but the child is your responsibility as well as the mothers so it's only fair. (as long as you still get to see the baby) but you have so much going on right now with a new baby and all i say forget about what anyone is saying who cares about them anyway.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	why did you have a baby together if you didn't think you would be together very long?<br>  <br>  if you want to be with her, she wants to be with you, then i dont see the problem??<br>  <br>  your young, my parents got together at the age of 16, had a baby at 18 and were together until 3 years ago when my dad sadly passed away, there is no reason why you wont stay together|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Just cause people tell you that your not going to last with her.

If things don't work out, then just be ther for your child, but don't think about that now.  What you should be worried about now is how to support the child & be a good father.  Everything else will come.|`|w9jx0JYLaa	If its something you both want then you can do it :)<br>  And even if the romatic/intimate relationship doesn't work, you will always be that childs father, so you and his/her mother will always have some kind of relationship between the two of you.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Whether or not you are in a relationship with the mother, you should support your child. <br>  <br>  And sure, the odds of your relationship lasting are lower because of your age, but it can (and has) been done.|`|nYioXmnGaa	I I were you and your wife just had a baby a week ago  I would be helping her !!!!|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	congratulation but how do you gonna be able to tell your kid that you have her or him in a early ages once it start getting older.|`|1AOr7waCaa	YEA U HAVE A CHILD THEY JUST HATIN BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU WAS 40 DAT CULD STILL HAPPEN SO DONT WERRY BOUT U R THE AGE CONGRATS|`|00bc0e3e68b9f2e24d8a3f859bc6d095aa	Just be there for her and the baby!Dont listen to what other people say,they might be jealous!!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	The child with your child should last a life time<br>  <br>  You should pay child support, if you are not living with the mother<br>  That what fathers do<br>  If the parents are living together, you are supporting the child<br>  If you are not, you pay child support, for the child protection, the mother should have a court order<br>  <br>  I know several fathers that are great dads to their daughters, that are no long with the mothers.

They're not matchy or trendy but they still go together very nicely, and the names themselves are beautiful and underused.<br>  <br>  You probably just made a typo with Phoebe, but if not - you inverted the o and the e!  People do tend to do that quite a bit, so even though I think Phoebe is also a wonderful name, there is the potential of misspelling.|`|lCiFNdcpaa	definitely set 2<br>  they are original yet  classic and a name they can have as they get older and not be looked at as a little girl.<br>  =]|`|n7BIleRFaa	1) Shiloh Hope And Sasha Faith definitely pick these!!!|`|pl7lWGZDaa	Shea Mackenzie and Savannah Lee|`|0M3Vfq0Vaa	Shiloh Hope and Sasha Faith...BEAUTIFUL names!!|`|FThME4mXaa	*brandy & sandy|`|tTKXq4Ohaa	Shiloh Hope and Sasha Faith<br>  <br>  I would of picked Nadine Kate, but I really don't like Willow
GZn5VNlSaa	They won't kill either of you. You need to be mature about this and tell them flat out.  Be honest on how the two of you are happy about this in spite of your ages. And tell them that you're telling them because you need their support. You need them by your side, but as happy as you are, it is a difficult situation for someone your age, and you can use every bit of support as possible.<br>  I'm sure they'll be understanding eventually.<br>  It will strike them initially, but it is something you have to face as mature as possible and not behind some baby bottle w/ a note - that only indicates "mommy i know i'm 10 but i'm having a baby" it's very childish and it seems you want to hide behind that and not face them, which is what you should do.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	You really just need to act like an adult and go to them and let them know face to face.  It is okay to be afraid.  Most your age should be.  I think that it is great that you are already planning ahead for the future.  You need to tell your parents that when you talk to them.  Just remember that they might be really upset at first, after all you are their baby having a baby, but things will blow over and all will work out.  Good luck!|`|LDiBjNf5aa	Telling them face to face will show them how responsible you are, but they also may not recognize that right away. If you are genuinely concerned about their reaction, then giving them the information in a way that gives them time to take it in could also work. It's entirely up to you, and how you know your parents.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and good luck. =)|`|azpsJ49faa	You shouldn't tell them in a cutesy sort of way, because as much as you think it is a happy occasion, they are going to be extremely stunned, maybe even angry. You need to sit them down face to face (WITH your boyfriend) and explain the situation. Make sure to include your plans for the baby so you have something to back yourselves up. And if you're being serious about being scared they will kill you, tell them with someone in your family you trust....like a cousin, aunt, uncle, etc.....good luck!|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	i do agree with someone else, if your at school and hes at home, where is the money coming from?to keep a roof over your head, clothes on your chillds back? <br>  <br>  i think you may have your head in the clouds and think everything is just going to be plain sailing, yes he may have a steady job, but employers can get impatient and my need someone to work hours that are not after school hours and maybe daytime.|`|w9jx0JYLaa	how are you going to support this baby if you are at school all day while he stays home and babysits?<br>  i think you got a lot more figuring out to do my dear.<br>  <br>  You need to tell them as soon as you can, they will help you come up with a more realistic plan..|`|otFCWMuUaa	well honestly you need to sit down n tell them face to face. it was the hardest thing ever to tell my parents but you will be suprised at the support you'll get from them. yes they wont be happy but you are their daughter and they will help you to make the best decisions..<br>  <br>  <br>  first id like to say that age doesnt determine how well of a mother you are . but you do need to realize all this entails.. my bf makes a thousand a month right now n is no where close to being what is need to support a child and ourselves... formula costs alone if you dont breastfeed are 300-400 a month and diapers are only a little under that.. so your really goin to need some help from your parents so make sure you approach them with your plans and humble yourself n make it known that you know you made a mistake n you wanna make the best of it and start makin right decisions not only for u but for the baby and that in order to do anything that you need their love n support... n express your fear. come to them like an adult n they will treat u like one.<br>  <br>  my parents are very religious so it was very hard.. n it crushed them.. but they quickly made sure that my bf and i have everything in line we need to have in line for when our little one is here..<br>  <br>  thank god my bf just got a new job doubling his salary and hes in the military so its helped us out quite a bit.. <br>  <br>  for all the intial baby stuff we calculated about $4600.. thats alot of money.. my bf had a decent amount savings.. which is helpin us out with gettin ready..<br>  <br>  my suggestion to your bf is to start saving and save lots and be on the search for an even better job..<br>  <br>  its gonna be hard... and a long process.<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	If you believe you are old enough to have a child, you should be old enough to have an adult one on one conversation with your parents. Skip the little things like the baby bottle in the microwave...that's a cutesy way of telling your significant other, not your parents. If you absolutely CAN NOT bear to tell them to their face, then call them on the phone (DO NOT TEXT). It's much better for everyone involved if you can hear tones in the voices. If they take it calmly, then you and your boyfriend may ask to have a sit down with them so everyone can be involved in the discussion.|`|ZepyVdWaaa	Haha, I'm 18 married and 9 weeks pregnant and still had trouble telling my Mom. But when I did it was worth it. I called her as soon as I left the clinic and said Hey Grandma! ( My husband is military and we are stationed across the country).. You know what she did? Went and bought baby clothes... So don't stress.. They will accept you and the baby.. They will just need time to think.|`|GzpkA8HFaa	I would say that creativity is not a need here. If you really feel that you can't do it face to face, Write a note, and leave it somewhere you know it will be read. Or even go more informal and text/email your parents.|`|GU8HZcxsaa	drop it on the nice and slow. they will prob not approve. but just say... mom im pregnant, and let them react, then tell them everything you have planned for the baby|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	heres a bigger problem. If your boyfriend is going to graduate how old is he? cause if he's 18 then he is gonna be in some trouble|`|MEBoSabxaa	I think it will be ALOT better if you tell them to their faces, you cant run away from that|`|GSEslPnTaa	I am 16 and pregnant so i know what you are feeling.<br>  I was sooooo scared to tell my parents, but the sooner you do it the better it will be.<br>  This is what i did: when my dad was out of town i just was watching tv with my mom and then blurted it out, she cried and yelled and hugged me and told me that everything was going to be alright.<br>  Later when my dad got home my mom told him when i wasn't around.<br>  <br>  They are going to cry, yell, scream, and be VERY disappointed in you but they are your parents and they love you...no matter what.<br>  <br>  I hope that everything works out for you, your family, the baby, and your boyfriend. <br>  You have a hard time coming up in these next few months (and years) and if you ever need anyone to talk to please e-mail me jessicahallie@yahoo.com <br>  I am 16 and 6 months pregnant with a beautiful little girl and everything is going fine with me, my family is really supportive and so is my boyfriend and his family.<br>  good luck and please e-mail me to talk sometime (:|`|yDuCKPWxaa	Umm, You might think im joking here but i think you should do it in front of a police officer to their face cause my cousin got pregnant at 14 (guy was 15) and told her parents, and like she was super responsible she had even already set up a health care plan for the baby. But her parents called her a whore beat her said she couldn't see the guy who got her pregnant ever again and banned her from leaving the house. As far as i know, now the only person she sees besides carter (the husband now lol) since shes run away is me. Then again she is the happiest ive ever seen her when her baby and carter are by her side. In otherwords dont try to get rid of it (which im sure that some people will tell you to do) because you probably will regret it but try to raise it having as many people as you can helping you care for it hope the advice helps even if I didnt quite answer your question.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	You should tell them face to face. You need to show that you are responsible and honest. You should just sit them down one night, and warn them that it is going to be something that they want to hear. Then just tell them. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I applaud you for not aborting the baby, I know a lot of people your age who would just get rid of it.|`|GLJkGgloaa	First off<br>  A "steady" job is NOT making 800-900 dollars month, that barely covers our Mortgage.<br>  <br>  Second, Tell them.<br>  You can't a pregnancy for that long.<br>  <br>  3rd, Your parents can file for Rape charges. If you parents are mad enough they can. And your bf would go to jail.<br>  <br>  4th, You will need need alot of support from family to get through this. I am Pregnant and Married and I still as an adult need alot of help. It's my first pregnancy and it's very scary.<br>  Good Luck|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	"Mom, Dad I am pregnant and we are very excited but need help." <br>  <br>  Please tell them something like that in person. Do not try to make it cute or take it lightly. You are going to need A LOT of help. If your boyfriend is making $900/mo(we will figure this with the high end of things) he will only have and income of 10,800/year. That may sound like a lot of money when you are 15, but trust me this is not nearly enough to raise a baby and survive.|`|7UfK1CPZaa	you'll feel ALOT Better when you do, and it's better they find out by you, than someone else.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|c01987f2cf9d98f28a9958d69b66ea7faa	There is only one thing you CAN do. You need to tell them, up front, and truthfully. Don't wright a note and leave it in a baby bottle. You have done an adult thing. Now you need to own up and face the truth.<br>  <br>  You have no idea what is going to happen once the baby comes. You only THINK you know you have everything planned out to the smallest detail. Trust me, you do not have a clue. My words may piss you off, but honey, I have been there. I am mom to 4. I was married when I got pregnant with my first child, and I was 21. When I brought my son home, I was overwhelmed with how much work it takes to raise one child. My BBF had her son just hours before me, and it was an almost daily occurrence to call each other and cry. We had no idea how hard it was going to be.<br>  You need prenatal care, NOW. You owe this to your child. You need to talk to the boy's family as well. Scary stuff, yes, but it HAS to be done.<br>  Your parents are going to be shocked, hurt and plenty pissed, but, they will not kill you, and you are the one who will say what happens to your baby, not them. They can only suggest.<br>  HIS family are going to be equally as upset. Time to face the music head on.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Please tell them to their face. They will respect you so much more. It is a more responsible and adult way of handling it. Just prepare yourself for getting the look of dissappointment. If you just sit them down amd tell them you need to talk then they will prob know something is up anyway and that will be one of the things running through their heads. Or maybe you could tell your mom first (if you're more comfortable with her and maybe she could tell your dad or vice versa. This is not the first time this has happened to someone and it won't be the last. I hope you're bf sticks around. babies are a lot more work than you can know until you have one yourself. Take care of yourself, eat healthy drink lots of water and take your vitamins!
DHyUnhS1aa	Well, looks like its time to talk to her about abortion, adoption, and parenting so she can decide which one she wants to do.  It sounds like you are a responsible mother who tried your best--you are just unlucky and have a stupid teen.  You tried your best to educate her and she still made a bad decision.  Let her know she WILL be taking responsibility, one way or another.|`|SohrsIBoaa	Abort.|`|J2glFOkhaa	Whoa, you must really want this answered. This is the 3rd post I've seen in like 5 minutes<br>  <br>  I say be there for 9 months, and give that baby to someone who will love and care for it. Adoption is something I truly stress as something that needs to be done when teens get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Oh, and try reading her a book. Why murder that poor innocent baby, all because you failed to teach your daughter that her body isn't a piece of meat<br>  <br>  You people make me sick. baby killers|`|a5IodNYVaa	do not worry. mary had jesus when she was 12.<br>  <br>  btw a lot of girls are pregnant in my orphanage. rape keeps happening in africa. or they are simply too wild.<br>  <br>  for now be a parent, be supportive. dont punish her. there's no positive effect in any kind of punishment. I know this, I run an orphanage. and abortion, if you want to do that, ask what the baby did to deserve this.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	ok first of all chill....freaking out and posting this a zillion times on yahoo will not make it go away (although id prob do the same) try and calm so you can think and feel better about it all and then judge the situation!<br>  <br>  you did all the right things a mother should do so pease do not blame yourself for this. think of your options the likelihood if she has the baby is that you will have to pay for it.....imagine you were pregnant can you afford it? can you afford daycare if need be? do you want to be looking after a baby again? shes going to have to finish school so ultimately you will be the one 'parenting'|`|mjd1EtDWaa	I agree, dont do the abortion. But dont make her go full term to "teach her a lesson" <br>  <br>  Do that to save a life, the lesson that goes with that will be priceless, but thats not the reason to have her go full term.<br>  <br>  I would also have her active in a adoption process. <br>  <br>  Support her when needed. Trust me, it will be needed. You may need to have her homeschool.... after awhile. <br>  <br>  This wont be easy. And unless your up for rasing a baby, I would go with an adoption. People who have been wanting a baby but unable to concieve will be sooo blesssed.<br>  <br>  But hey, I am only almost 16. You dont have to listen to me.<br>  <br>  (Also have tour daughter speak to some teenagers some day, she will be an inspiration and her lesson can be learned by others...)|`|O22JiTsEaa	abortion she has a good life you dont want to ruin it keep a good eye on her. dont let her be on her own. no after school cuz she could be having s e x.  tell her she way to young this is a little harsh but tell her do you wanna be a hooker then dont have sex!<br>  <br>  for people who hate abortion i under stand but really only little girls who are 12-18 should get abortions. why because you dont want them to have a sucky life|`|3KoGUAfLaa	If you are really the caring mother it sounds like you are, you should support her all the way through. True, you may not agree with it...but would you feel better knowing your child would be out in the streets doing God knows what for money because she's legally too young to get a job. Just be there for her, let her know how you feel about the situation (that you don't approve), but that you're going to be a responsible mother just like you expect her to be.|`|z8Txtjvdaa	Your not a bad mother she just needs to live up to her action dont let her get an abortion because then she's going to think every action she does there always going to be away out and that not true. Let her have her baby and be there to support her that's what she needs from you right now and if she aint telling you who she slept with then my guess will be she was having sex with an older guy|`|ZepyVdWaaa	Well, my mother got pregnant for the first time at 13, but my grandmother made her have an abortion. Well my Mom had me right after she turned 16. And she went on later to have 3 more kids and 1 m/c. I wouldn't recommend an abortion because my mother regrets hers to this day.. Adoption makes more sense..|`|3rBYqlCJaa	wow! i feel bad for u! i am against abortion so i wouldent do it, i wish i can help you in so many ways! dont let her do an abortion cause thats very dangerous and its killing another human bean and should NOT be done AT ALL! talk with her and ask her what made you do this? email me if u need more help! <br>  <br>  Best of Luckk!!|`|jQmHlXaZaa	Wow. that is horrible. i am against abortion. that is ruining a kids life. just make her promise she will take care of it and tell her she got herself into this...  that is kinda crazy.|`|98af10450421f259777b4641873871e2aa	PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE CHOICE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER! If you found out u were pregnant at your age you'd be devastated but you would probably go a head with it. whats the difference to young to old rich poor it's all the same were never ready for a baby.  so  suck it up and help her raise it. If you are there to help it won't be so bad she can still go to school. I have three friends that were pregnant at her age.One was a dead beat already drinking drugging and having numerous partners but now she is completely different she goes to school shes a great mature and hardworking mom.                             My friend Jennys mom dad boyfriend and b/f family all ganged up on her and basically gave her no choice but to have an abortion. To this day she never fully forgave her family she has a baby now and she says she can't stand watching her parents play with her cause all she thinks is how much they would have loved her first baby. you can't forgive somebody if you didn't make the choice yuorself.also  she will probably get pregnant again this time it wont be an accident.thats why jenny has a baby now. theres a whole you can never fill. so you have another baby to fill it. My other friend lost her baby to the state she thought she was ready but she didnt have family to support her and she said everyone looked at her so horribly she says she works hard everyday so she can prove herself and get her baby back.so anyways mom. ask your daughter what she would like to do and tell her it will be hard but your there to help.|`|W0nd3qF3aa	I dont think that you should have an abortion. Yes she is very young, however this will teach her a huge lesson on how she needs to learn to be responsible. Maybe you could help take care of the baby or put her up for adoption? Also because if you give her the choice of having an abortion then she will think oh i can just do it again and I will just get an abortion no big deal.ALso she might end of getting some sort of STD and something bad will happen. I think that you should make her go to full term and teach her a lesson. Also maybe she will learn to be more open with you.|`|aNrrUM0Naa	I feel she should get the abortion. Im not for abortions but the FACT is at 13 years old an abortions is A LOT safer than continuing with the pregnancy. mothers between 16-19 are more likely to die during birth complication so imagine the odds at being only 13/14.<br>  making her keep it wont teach her a lesson, being forced to be a mom wont make you a good mom.<br>  get the abortion.<br>  take it as a lesson learned.|`|T09JSSiraa	okay well i am young too so from my point of view i would just let her know you are there for her and that people make mistakes and whatever you do don't let her get a abortion because that messes up your whole woman system but just be there for her and don't let her drop out. thats what i would want my mom to say is that she is there and that she loves me no matter what you know|`|3tLjWbriaa	i really cant say anything cause im 13 years old 2 but that is not right haveing a child at 13 years old wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!! she mite have 2 drop out of school cause of that..
CdJtH0xdaa	PLEASE do not abort. You may think that is the best way out, but when you go to have the abortion, you will feel differently. Believe me, I've been in this situation before. It is best to go through with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Ignore Hannah, she is no better than the murdering Doctor who performs an abortion. <br>  <br>  SHE had sex, so SHE must have wanted a baby.

All you can do is pray and hope that the talking gets to her. In this case, she did what she wanted and she is going to have to pay for the consequences. I was fourteen when I first had sex. I just now finally made the decision to get pregnant, and now I am 8 weeks with my first child with the same guy I have been with and lost my virginity to. What will mostly happen in this situation, is you will end becoming the mother of her child, unless you feel she is responsible enough to take care of herself and another child, which Im not sure she is ready for that. Overall, I think its her decision whether or not to have an abortion, its her child. I am highly against abortion that is used as a "plan B method" however, your the parent of a child that is going to be a parent, its your call.. Just remember that god wouldn't give you anymore than what you can handle, and everything happens for a reason.. I wish you and your family all good luck, with whatever happens.|`|gA22md42aa	um safe sex for a 13 year old?  That's like encouraging sex.<br>  <br>  Let her have the child.

Abortion is the easy way out and life is not about taking the easy way out.  <br>  <br>  Live the consequences of your actions and decisions.  Learn from them.<br>  <br>  Now if she was raped that's another story.... No girl should live the scars of being violated.|`|l1STgPyRaa	what does she want to do with this pregnancy?<br>  <br>  if you force her into abortions or adoptions she may never get over that and you will lose her.<br>  <br>  This is not a reflection on you, it is just a pore decision that she made now is the time that she will have to take some ownership of that.<br>  <br>  <br>  if she wants to keep the child are you able and willing to help her with the child so that she is able to stay in school, with out it costing you everything in the bank or savings, keep a life that you are used to at lest to most extents, I know you will not be able to have things the same as they are now if you help your child raze a child specially if she is totally dependent on you for it. but lets face it forcing her to do something with this child could only end up with her being more out of control then she has been, (behind your back anyway) and make things much worse between you two. <br>  <br>  the main thing with all this is that she needs to be able to stay in school, and if you are able to help her do that and keep the child at lest then she may think again before having another sexual encounter with out protection. is she fine other then being pregnant? I mean as to STDS and things? i would just help her with the child while she is at school then it is up to her to take back control of the child and be a mom she will learn that way and yes she may lose her childhood over it but that is her consequence's!! <br>  <br>  If she is not telling you whom the dad is maybe it was not her idea to have sex that time, and a look at friends and family may be something that you need to do! tell her if she does not tell you then you will call the police and ask them to investigate it as a rape or at lest child exploitation <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ouUti34faa	Please, don't kill your grandchild, because that is exactly what it is. That baby she's pregnant with did nothing wrong and deserves nothing but all the love in the world. You may have messed up with your daughter, but you will be messing up horribly by telling her to kill her baby. Yes, there are risk factors for her age, but there are just as many, if not more, for mother 40+ years old. Give her all the care she can and help her through it. You may want to suggest adoption, but you'll need to start the family selections early so the baby can be taken straight from the hospital instead of to an orphanage. Children will be children, and all mess up because of their hardheadedness, some sooner than others and worse than others. If you talked with her and monitored her actions when going out, then you should feel no guilt. You did your best, but you must realize that a kid will do what they want if they really want to, sometimes without considering the consequences. Good luck and keep that baby's heart beating like a good grandma.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Don't have her get an abortion please, that is completely wrong, don't punish an innocent baby for ur daughters mistake.  Have her go through with the pregnancy and either keep the baby and help her to raise it, or give the baby up for adoption.<br>  I know this is a scary situation since she's so young, but killin an innocent baby isn't the answer.<br>  My 9 year old sis got pregnant (she was raped, didn't willin get pregnant) but anyways, she had the baby and her daughter is now 7 months old, and she is a great mother.  Course my lil sis is extremely mature for her age and always has been, but it still was a scary situtaion.<br>  So please talk to ur daughter and explain everything to her, how it would change her life to keep and raise the baby and how it would change her life to give her baby up for adoption.  And please tell her that abortion isn't the answer, and that gettin one could be the biggest mistake ever.<br>  Hope this helps, and good luck, i hope everythin works out ok.|`|AA11486328	first of all. put yourself in her position and think what would you like your mother to do for you if you were in that position. It must not be easy and alot to take but everything in life happends for a reason and am sure that although it may seem like the worse thing that could happen, everything will be ok. Look for support groups and talk to your daughter about how she feels and thinks of the situation. I do not believe in abortion but respect peoples opinion so talk to her and decided whats the best way to deal with  a situation like this. best of luck to you and your daughter.|`|fZGBjtpVaa	Talk to your daughter, tell her about what you went through with her when she was born.  Make sure she fully understands what she's getting herself into.  Last thing you want to do is force her to make a decision she doesn't want to make, but accept that she's made a mistake and support her 100%.<br>  <br>  Just remember that only she can make that decision herself if she wants to keep the baby, you can't make it for her.  And if you do, she may end up resenting you for it.|`|UZ2mMaS5aa	I would say go for the abortion knowing how bad this would mess up her life but if that isn't a choice maybe you could do it old school ship her to a family member out of state and when she has the baby give it up for adoption or if she is "in love with it" keep said baby and you raise it.|`|SH07M84maa	Scary stuff....abortion is the easy way out..... I think it is good to be open with your daughter, but you still need to be a parent, not a friend.<br>  <br>  If you go ahead with the pregnancy, are you prepared to basically be a parent to a baby again? If not then you should consider abortion unfortunately...or adoption?|`|P1E2Ona2aa	im guessing shes in grade 8...<br>  so am i :)<br>  anyways..<br>  she is young, and it was wrong for her to do.<br>  you cant change the past.<br>  i advise you to either keep the baby or give it up for adoption.<br>  orrrrrrrr, abortion if you choose to.<br>  <br>  talk to your daughter lovingly about what she did and why she did it.<br>  it must be hard for her as well.<br>  just know, you are not the only parent worried about their childddd.<br>  hope i helped :)|`|EmiLrxQoaa	that is so bad situation. ? think you should get more professinal advice from someone who can really help you to get out of that situation. cos, that matter is to fragile..not something you can get through on our own !!|`|FEStjFIRaa	NO ABORTION FEMALE SHES GONNA GET TRAUMATIZED!!!!!<br>  I SAY'D LET HER HAVE THE BABY AND RAISE IT AS IF IT WAS HER LITTLE BROTHER YOU MUST HELP ALL THE TIME...SHE GOTS TO CONTINUE SCHOOL SO IN TH FUTURE SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HIM AS A MATURE MOTHER!!!!!|`|FG75AjcRaa	get her to have an abortion, mmk? or, consider adoption if that sounds good to you.

You were probably a great mother.  I am 21, 6 weeks pregnant & getting an abortion tomorrow.  I make $20.00 an hour, been with my boyfriend for 6 years, and we're not even ready.  Kids make mistakes.  She may be upset or unhappy considering the thought of abortion, but she is not ready.  You'll basically be raising the child.  She hasn't even started high school yet.  Hopefully she learns from this, and doesn't make the same mistake.  She's definitely not ready, and shouldn't keep the child if she can't even tell you who she's been intimate with.  The last thing you would want is for her to have the baby, and continue doing what she does.  You can only do so much & try to teach her as much as you can, it's really up to her to utilize the knowledge you've given her.  She may even be thankful to you later on for not letting her keep the child because when she gets older she will realize that she wasn't ready.  She's not even at the age where she can get a part time job.  Do what's best for the baby, not her.  Don't bring the baby into the world in her situation it's unfair to the child to have to suffer.    Actually it's not a baby yet, it's still a fetus.  Don't let it become a baby.|`|Ff15178saa	first of all it isn't anything that you have done you can not blame your self by saying what kind of mom am i .. look back when you were a kid and think about how tricky sex boys and all that was now times that by at least 10. now it is time to be 2 different kinds of mom all in one ,, because your frontin the bills for all this cuz shes a minor so you support her when she needs it and always be a hard *** let her know it is all up to her 2 figure out food diapers etc. she chose this choice now it is her to decide the rest of her life.. i dont care for abortion i am more for giving a baby to someone who can not have children. maybe have a open adoption were u will know how child is doing or a closed one where you will not no any thing but this will be hard for your daughter remind her that when her kid is 13 she will be 26 and her 20s well there gone she wont live knowing what it is really like , to be a 20 yr old good luck to you and your family dont let the fighting between the sibs n parents get out of control n feel left out
HkpMFkQBaa	Hi Hun, I Was In The Exact Same Position...My Baby's Head Wasnt Engaged At All, So Much So That I Couldnt Have A 'Sweep' But I Was Still Able To Be Induced...I Went Into Hospital On 8th Nov 08 And She Was Born On The 9th Via Forceps :]<br>  Good Luck And Congrats :] xx<br>  Feel Free To Email Me: lil_lass_15@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  EDIT: She Was 13 Days Overdue|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You can still be induced, they just wouldn't rupture your membranes artificially because of the risk for cord prolapse when the head is not firmly applied to the cervix. And if that baby's head isn't down, your cervix might not be very thinned out or started to dilate a little, and you may need cervical ripening overnight before an induction would be favorable. Talk to your doctor.|`|HM0cxcahaa	It depends if it is your first pregnancy it could mean that your pelvis is not shaped to allow a vaginal delivery and may need a C Section, they also worry about the babies cord prolapsing and coming out before bub, if it is your subsequent pregnancy its not uncommon for your bubs head to not be engaged until active labour.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	Yes i would have thought you would still be induced and put on a drip to start your contractions which will obviously push the babies head down.  I was induced and can i give you a bit of advice, the drip makes the contractions a lot stronger than in a natural birth so take the epidural option, i'm so glad i did and i asked for it before anyone offered so that i knew i'd get it for sure.  <br>  <br>  Gas and air is brilliant too but doesn't work as well after a while so i found the epidural really helped me a lot.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with the above user. If your baby still isn't engaged by 14days after your due date they'll get you in for a c-section.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	Jill is right, I was induced 14 days over with my 2nd child and they told me exactly what Jill has said.|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	As far as I know the maximum time you are allowed to go overdue is two weeks.  If babys head is not engaged then they may have to do a ceserian section.|`|hNIof0lbaa	You can be induced still! GOOD LUCK girl!!!!!!!!!!
3gkiLN73aa	Planned parenthood will give you free birth control without parental consent.  It is important to remember that if you are on the pill to take it every day at the same time.  If you can't remember, or if you are afraid of your mom seeing them, then try the ring, patch, shot, or arm implant.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Sorry, you're a minor and if you're a minor, you must have parental approval.  No way around it.  Either talk to your mother about the issue or forget about it.  Whatever you do, do NOT have unprotected sex.  You do not need a pregnancy at 14.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I personally believe if you're mature enough to have sex, you're mature enough to talk to your parents. If you can't be mature enough then you should be even thinking sex. <br>  <br>  Enjoy being a teen, So many fun things to do other than sex. Sex can always wait. You're only a teen once.|`|ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	Since you know how pregnancy is caused... I suggest you just do every other sexual activity except THAT ONE.<br>  <br>  Then you don't have to worry about getting pregnant or your mom finding out anything.|`|a5IodNYVaa	consider the health effects. thats why people in many countries still have it difficult to obtain.|`|fzANVpWqaa	please let your mom know|`|rz24OE4haa	just so you know. Birth control can be very dangerous. You can develop blood clots that can cuase serious problems. Pluss you are only 14 which is wayyy to young to be having sex. Id suggest having the guy use protection and just be veryy verryy careful. I would not recomend you going behind your parents back to get birth control.|`|gTfNdFAzaa	your just a child. personally i think you should wait a few more yrs before you have sex for the 1st time. i had sex for the 1st time at 18yrs old, and i lost it to the person i married. you should really think twice before you have sex at 14yrs old!!  <br>  <br>  FYI you need to a parent to get birth control!|`|O22JiTsEaa	dont do it girl your to young i dont care if you both think your ready.<br>  condoms and birth control aren't 100% right <br>  <br>  and if your mom finds out your *** will be done for.<br>  reamber you may think they wont find out but they will.
QAptQNMOaa	You can actually get tests that will tell you if you are pregnant 10 days after ovulation. Maybe try one of those if you can find one. They say after you ovulate you conceive within those two wks. I dont know how that works though it does. Thats why they say you are actually pregnant for 40 wks because they take it from the first day of your last period. You may be too early for it to pick up if you are. If your happy to wait then i would say wait until after your due. Good Luck|`|iMULlxdgaa	take it when you miss your first period.  thats what i alwys do and i never have any question as to the validity of the test.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	You can take your test 4 days before your period starts with the early tests like First response. You may get a faint line. Even faint lines are positive. If you get a negative one dont be dissapointed yet, the tests arent very accurate until you miss your period. Use ur first morning urine or else wait 4 hours during the day w/o peeing and w /o drinking a whole lot first cuz that dilutes the hcg hormone the test is looking for.|`|YlLmAADraa	some pregnancy tests say you can test like 4 or 5 days before your expected period but the chances of there being enough Hcg hormone for it to make it positive may not be there. wait until atleast March 2 to take another test and test first thing in the morning with the first pee of the day. i suggest using clear blue digital tests so that it says "pregnant" or "not pregnant" so you cannot read it incorrectly.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|wohGR1Nkaa	From the day of the last day of your period count 19 days and then will be good enough to take a test.<br>  And after a mised period take a test after 5 days.<br>  Should give the hcg levels in your body time to process strong enough to tell :)|`|dg6wd8ufaa	Try taking a test (First Response is your best bet) In about 4 days. Then if you are pregnant you will know. If you still dont have your period then go see a doctor.|`|BO28Mn8haa	its 5 days before your missed period but to be safe i'd wait until 5 days after. just be patient. baby dust to you|`|GzpkA8HFaa	Most tests will show up about 5 days before the missed period.|`|beNeWKKRaa	i would wait till feb 28 through the 5th. if no period take a pregnancy test. if negative then go have blood test at ur obgyn.
nzSBkDHxaa	I would certainly be concerned.  You are paying a lot of money to have this daycare watch your child.  It sounds like you might want to bring up your concerns to the director of the daycare.  Tell her that you are concerned about the safety of your son as well as others and inquire about the type and level of supervision he is getting.  Tell her that you have had excellent experience with the daycare so far but you are now upset with the amount of incident reports that you are getting.  Hopefully the director will take your concern seriously and look into the matter.  If not, that would seem to be a clear indication that it is time to look for a different daycare.  Good luck!  Hope your little boy is ok! :)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I would talk to the people and be sure that my child wasn't in the same group as the 2 new biters. That is excessive to have your kid bit that many times. I would also ask what they are doing about the biters, are they  keeping them away from the other kids or considering not allowing them to attend until they get over this bad behavior. You have every right to know this as it has affected your child.|`|qayCggxMaa	It may just be a bad month.  Since you are having concerns you might talk to the director.  Does the staff seem concerned about this or do they just hand you the sheets without a comment each day?  I'd be really upset if they didn't seem concerned at all - they should be talking to you about what steps they are taking to prevent this kind of thing in the future.  There was a brief run in my son's room (he is also almost 2) where he was getting bit every day by another kid.  On the 3rd day in a row he had been bitten, the assistant director took me aside and talked to me and told me how they had talked to the child's parents and were working with them and watching the child closer to prevent any more biting.   Other than that though, accidents happen.  There have been months where there will be nothing and then there will be weeks where one or the other (or both) of my kids have incidents/accidents every day.  The question you have to ask yourself is how preventable do these seem.  My son had one yesterday where they said he was spinning around and hit his head on a highchair (big red mark next to his eye).  I see that as kids being kids and not really preventable (without them ending up being overprotective).|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i agree with you that is worrying i mean once ok but 4 times? seriouly where were the adults i understand they donot have eyes on the back of there heads but this there job and what there trained to do. i personally would approach the supervisor and ask her how this was allowed to happen and what there doing to prevent it happening again etc. if he continues to get reports id take it further|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I work at a day care and honestly the biting kids need to be kicked out. It's usually 3 strikes and your suspended. I wouldn't necessarily blame the teacher cause I see kids get bit and by the time I get to them it's over, it happens so fast. I've been bit myself more times than I can count, so there's not much you can do about the behavior if the child's parents don't work with you. But I would lose my mind if my child kept getting hurt and nothing was being done so I think you should talk to the director.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Interesting, the "incident reports" are going to you. I certainly hope they are also going to the parents of the 'biters and pushers'. If this has happened more than once, then one would question whether the people in the daycare are new, or are they really watching the children as they should. New children come and go. It is up to them to be aware of what is going on. Are there too many children in the daycare at one time? It seems as though it is time to sit down with the person who runs the daycare and have a thorough talk about the situation. You should be able to expect a safe enviroment for your child. If your child is just falling between the cracks in this daycare, maybe he needs to be in a situation where there are a few less kids, such as in an inhome daycare, or a smaller facility. Talk to the people who run this, and even set up a time for a meeting when they can devote some time to you, without interuptions.|`|wE5JMeesaa	Haha!  Welcome to my world.<br>  I am a daycare teacher for kids 18-26 months, and I know just how you feel.  I hope that I can shed some light on your situation from behind the scenes.<br>  Biting is so common for this age group.  It's awful for us, because we don't want the children to get hurt, and we don't want the children to hurt one another.  And as much as it sucks, it's part of life for a 2 year old in daycare.  They can't communicate properly, and they only way for them to say "No.  I don't like that."  So they bite. So while it's socially unacceptable, it's very common.<br>  As for the supervision, that's an honest, genuine concern.  I don't know your daycare, and I don't know your daycare standards... Hopefully class ratios were something you considered when choosing a school.  NAEYC (National Association for the Education of Young Children) standards say for this age group, 1:5 (One teacher to five children), but my state ratio is 1:7.  Even with these especially low class sizes, it is simply impossible to be everywhere at once.  I have two arms, and a good sized room.  The bites happen so quickly, it's absolutely impossible to catch every one.  But if you knew how many bites I prevented compared to the number that occur, you would be very impressed with my agility.  =)<br>  <br>  So.  I understand your concern completely.  I would feel the same way in your position... but it's not going to be different at any other daycare.  Biting happens.  It's awful, and everyone hates it, but it happens.  If you don't want your child to get hurt or sick, your only option is to keep them at home.  <br>  <br>  What you CAN do is this:<br>  Talk to your teachers.  See what they're doing to prevent this.  See what their course of action is when it does happen.  Do they use time outs?  Do they scare the pants off them?  NAECY and most schools shy away from time outs, but I think as parents, we all know that a little crying drives the point home.  In our classroom, we get very upset with our children and remind them firmly that biting hurts, and our teeth are for smiling and for eating, not for hurting our friends.  <br>  Also, what are they doing to treat the bites?  Ice goes a long way and can bring bruises down to nothing.<br>  Talk to your school owners.  Do they have an unenrolling policy?  How many bites constitutes removal from school?  What are they doing to prevent this?  What are their instructions for their teachers?  What can they suggest for you to do at home?<br>  Just be aware--since your child is biting too--the unenrolling may apply to you as well.<br>  <br>  I know this is difficult, but biting phases happen with this age group.  If your teachers can nip it in the bud early, it should only take a matter of weeks.  In my class of 14 (three teachers), we had our biting spell over in 12 days.  If your school is proactive, I'm sure they can make this problem nonexistent.|`|rOFteEdlaa	i used to work at a daycare and if a child bit anyone more then one time they were kicked out of the daycare for bad behaviour, i don't see why they keep the child that injures children if they are putting all the other kids in danger, and i believe the right ratio of children to care providers is 4 kids to one adult at lest that is were it is out in canada|`|VwaFM0L8aa	I had this problem my daughter was getting bitten for a good week. After the second time I had a talk with the director. She would not tell me who the bitter was but after my talk it never happened again. I assume the bitter was kicked out.<br>  Advice talk to the director ASAP|`|mKcLCpZSaa	Biting, as I am sure you know, is a VERY common phase among toddlers. I could be because of verbal frustration, oral sensation, or just for good ol' attention.  Some are the biters and some are, unfortunately, the victims.  I don't think there is a Toddler classroom where this isn't an issue. That being said, it doesn't make it ok for your 2yr old to be bitten all the time.  It's a good thing the school is documenting all of this.  It sounds like they are not letting much get by them.  Most classrooms will solve this problem by having the biting child become the teacher's shadow.  Wherever the teacher goes... the biter goes!  This can be very difficult for the teacher but it is a great strategy as the child moves out of this phase.  As you said there are two biters which can make it even more difficult!  Good thing the teacher had two hands!! Either that or there are usually two teacher within a classroom.  They may each need to take one!  Although it is a lot of work, it is the teacher's responsibility to make that classroom a safe environment for all the children within it!  You could ask for  a meeting with the teacher and possibly the director as well and suggest this strategy. Good Luck!<br>  Ps.  Don't turn on your Child Care for this reason (just yet)  Give them some time to fix the problem.  Like I said, this situation if very normal!|`|tVqLmImUaa	Those incident reports can be used to your advantage - that's what they're there for. Once it's clear a pattern of behavior, you can request action, and you and the daycare staff can use the documents to effectively remove the problematic child from the center. <br>  <br>  The biter/s will then have to find somewhere else, not you. I wouldn't remove your son - you shouldn't have to. That is what this system is designed for.<br>  <br>  As for the supervision, I doubt it is a reflection on that. Even if you a 10 inches away from a child it is very hard to stop them biting when they want to. It only takes an instant.

8XjJzj7Naa	Meaning, what age in life to start planning for a child? <br>  OR<br>  What time of the month?<br>  <br>  The best time of the month would be at your most fertile period. Which is usually between days 11-16 of your cycle. It is easy to track by using Ovulation Predictor Kits.|`|roe07rI8aa	Days 9-18 of your cycle - early (up to day 12 for a girl and later for a boy - allegedly!). have plenty of sex and have fun.|`|SYbJeHNBaa	The best time to do the baby dance is when your are ovulating, if your cycles are regular you can work out when you would be ovulating.  Google 'ovulation calculator' and you can enter the date of your last period and how long your cycles usually last and the results will tell you the best time to start dancing.  Another sure sign you are ovulating or just about to is by observing your cervical mucus, when it becomes slimey and resembles raw egg whites then thats the BEST time to dance. Also, a tip that worked for me conceiving both my babies was to not get out of bed after dancing, lie flat and prob up your bottom with a pillow and go to sleep for the night.  Gravity helps the swimmers reach their destination!  Hope this helps and best of luck!|`|wTNsIqe2aa	When you are ovulating! You can spend money to buy an ovulation kit or you could check out some of the links I posted below. I just use ovulation calculators online. If you just came off the pill your ovulation may be off though. If you keep good track of your periods you could use the second link I posted. The first one only requires you to put in the first day of your last period. Also, if you sign up on mymonthlycycles.com it's a great place to track your periods, fertile time, etc. If you still can't figure out your ovulation time you can look for signs you are ovulating by checking your mucous and taking your temperature first thing in the morning before you leave your bed. The last link I posted has great info on that!|`|6Nq3HKjYaa	try around july, that way when you are most pregnant will be during the winter months, and the baby will keep you warm :).  also babies born in spring is cool because thats when wild animal baies are and when plants are growing most, like a new beginning, jesus was reborn during the spring too

When I was 14 my dad took away my computer and i just shrugged and I did not hold it against him, it was my fault.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am2VE29D_fErrCYsWemqPqnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226142838AA6pmQ6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|J2glFOkhaa	What? 14 and acting a damn fool?? No, no, no honey. Whoop her ***! She is 14 not 4, forget that crap, you are the parent here!|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	I'm going to break into your house and steal your computer, let's see how you react.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Oh man I feel like I'm reading something my parents would go through with me. I wasn't skipping school, but I'd have such horrible tantrums at that age! I feel horrible about it now that I think about it. And I feel bad for you to have to go through that as well. <br>  <br>  It's normal for some teenagers to have issues like that. They're trying to be in control and get their ways. They want to be more independent. However, they're still too young and naive (especially those who are acting like this), and by law are to listen to you.<br>  <br>  When she cries, ignore her. Walk away and go into another room. Don't talk about it. You could be like, I don't like seeing you cry, but you need to listen to me. It's not that big of a deal. It's just a computer for a week. If it's so important to have your computer, behave. Otherwise, kiss it goodbye until you prove you are mature enough for me to trust you.<br>  <br>  Don't send her to her room for crying. Let her cry all she wants. Just don't cave into it. Stick to your guns and hold your ground.<br>  <br>  Shoot, when I was acting up, I got more than that taken away, just for smart-mouthing. Grounded for weeks. Butt whooped hard. It was a nightmare but I learned for sure.<br>  <br>  When I dated someone behind my parents backs after told I couldn't date him (I was about 16 at the time, JR in high school) I got grounded for almost a year. It was ridiculous.|`|PKLpZ1IOaa	Its going to be really hard to do this, especially in your situation but you have to ride this out. If you give into her tantrums then it will get way worse as she gets older and is able to do worse things than skip school. Don't give in to it, ignore her and do something fun and productive for yourself to get your mind off of her tantrums. She has to learn her lesson|`|xN11gIxUaa	I'm also 14, so i can handle this one:) Her behavior is unacceptable. And, as a parent I would not tolerate this. She's goiung to scream and pitch a fit but you have to stand a firm ground. Show her you're the boss. Good luck!|`|PbESvbu6aa	just wait it out this too shall pass|`|0w9tY32uaa	oh, wooooowww!<br>  im 14, and i never do that!<br>  is she P.M.S.ing? ha ha<br>  <br>  even though i don't act like that, i can see how she could easily get made when something is taken away, especially the computer, or in other words, her social life-line.<br>  if she crys, let her. <br>  she did something wrong, and she needs to get it through her head that its not okay for her to do that. <br>  you can send her to her room, but you dont have to, only if you dont ant to see her =]<br>  another good punishment is no friends/phone/makeup (or anything else that she enjoys.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	Oh, so she always got her way and expects to get her way all the time from now on.  Where are her limits?  She was never given any.<br>  <br>  Taking away the use of the computer for a week would be absolute torture.  But alas as a 14-year-old she'll know where else she can go for the computer.  A more torturous punishment would be to take away her iPod, cell phone or other electronic devices that are clearly hers.<br>  <br>  She's playing the blame game by telling you she hates you.  Ten years from now she'll apologize for being such a beech to you as a teen.  Many daughters are this way, BTW, so DON'T LET HER CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS!!!<br>  <br>  Tell her you are taking her computer privileges away and thats it.  Don't listen to her fake sobs and claims that she hates you.  She's only going to hate you until she wants money from you, which most likely will be 30 minutes from the time you read this.|`|8m40bYoYaa	teens HATE authority<br>  right now, she's trying to do what she wants in life<br>  i've cut class a couple times<br>  but not 3 times in one week<br>  but you just need to shake her up a bit<br>  take away her phone or whatever life source she has with friends<br>  ground her from going out<br>  <br>  my parents keep me in line pretty well because i know if I do that, i get grounded which sucks<br>  <br>  and if you say you're gonna do something DO IT<br>  she might say she hates you<br>  i mean god, i've tried to convince myself i hate my parents but i never can <br>  its one of those things<br>  cause moms ALWAYS end up doing something epic in the end<br>  that makes a kid remember how awesome their parents are<br>  <br>  so don't worry, she might tell her friends what a b***h you're being, but she'll get over it<br>  <br>  we always do|`|SmFcDx4waa	oh. my goodness. you sent her to her room for 14 WHOLE MINUTES???? one minute per year??? where did you learn how to discipline??? candyland? i agree with the first poster - whoop her! she is far to old to be acting that way and ditching school is a BIG deal...she is only acting that way because you DROPPED THE BALL the last 4 years by letting her get away with whatever she wanted...NOW you have a 14 yr old who DOES NOT RESPECT YOU. So you have to decide what you want...a kid who respects you and obeys and has structure in their life but does not always agree with you OR a kid who does not respect you, but says they love you while they walk all over you...you are her MOTHER not her little friend.
C4ibOR7Laa	maybe the baby is engaging|`|CJj5g3DMaa	it happens
mWukMOAeaa	Remember- there's no such thing as a stupid question<br>  <br>  These kids are afraid! They need somewhere to turn. Lots of people ask questions on here and I believe it's a good thing because I want to help if I can.|`|mjd1EtDWaa	I am gonna say the number of teen pregnacies, now and then, is and was too high.|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	OH I agree with you .  Their was this young girl it 13 and pregnant.  What are they thinking come on young people !|`|5f6XnInEaa	The rates have only really "shot up" in Australia, since the $5000 baby bonus was set up.<br>  Here , a lot of teens saw that as a better career path, straight out of high school.<br>  <br>  In regards to generally, yes, there are a few more, due to a few reasons.<br>  -More access to media, depicting happy teen celebrity parents-a few teens see the "Hey...so and so can do it, I will too" sort of thing, and thus inspires them to have a baby.<br>  <br>  That being said, I wouldn't beleive everything you read on here.<br>  Almost all of the 14 year olds saying "I'm pregnant" are actually just 14 year olds who WANT a baby, and are living out a weird fantasy online.<br>  <br>  I'm 19, got pregnant by accident of course, but I wouldn't change a thing for the world, maybe if I could, I'd have a better paying job.<br>  <br>  What I find stupid, is the amount of people complaining about teen pregnancies.<br>  Seriously, there are better things in the world to worry about.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Well, I'm 21...and I have a son who's 5 in May, so I'm gonna say yeah, it was like this 5 years ago. The difference isn't in the number of teen pregnancies, it's the number of people with internet in their homes. Which means, more pregnant teens have access to it.
xiCQj8YTaa	firstly take a pregnancy test<br>  if you are pregnant and on the pill you would still have periods due to the pill you could of had a heavier bleed because of the tablet (it turns your hormones upside down and thats why your boobs maybe bigger)<br>  sounds like your ok but like i said take a test to make sure|`|5wqjStm3aa	umm

CkkPaP8vaa	I though I was weird.  I am in my 13th week had no morning sickness but have had to force food down myself.  None of it makes me nauseated but I just feel too full and nothing really sounds good.  I have found that if I just stick to what fills me I will not be eating enough for both me and a healthy baby so I have added in Mini Snacks and make all my meals very small but eat about every 2 hours (recommended by most nutritionist anyway).  I have supplemented with instant breakfast to give me the extra calories but not fill me up to much and it’s easy to drink and forget about and doesn’t keep you full for long and you can take it anywhere.  I so far have not gained any weight but the doctor said all is good and to keep doing what I can to keep up to 1800+ calories a day (this is a push for me) and add in little extras here and there if I still don’t begin to gain a bit of weight.  Most recommend even more calories a day but my doctor understood that I am doing my best and the minimum should be about 1800 for me.   Also I have been told to just wait… food will begin to look great again soon.  Some it has been at 8 weeks, 15 weeks and some not until there last trimester.   I too feel great, things are falling into place and was worried about this myself but I count myself as one of the lucky ones.  I would rather have a low appetite than be sick all the time.|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	My first pregnancy I was unable to eat normally the entire time. I'm now pregnant with my second child (26 weeks) and I can't stop eating. Pregnancy is wacky but if you are really concerned you should try talking to your doctor. The real problems come in when you aren't getting enough nourishment. Are you loosing weight, feeling weak???|`|6C4ibyF8aa	it's normal :) i'm 24 weeks and my doc has me on meds. to help my loss of appetite because i still get morning sickness,etc. most likely it'll go away but everyone is different. good luck!|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	I don't really like to eat too much also but I do eat for the baby.  Your appetite might change later but for the meantime just put up with force-feeding yourself.  There really isn't much we can do.  One thing you can try is eat an apple in the morning.  Apples tend to have acidic juice that'll jump start the digestive track.  Worth a try.|`|xiCQj8YTaa	firstly dont stress out your baby is like a parasite and will take everything it needs from you, its you that will feel it!<br>  its good that your forcing it down take pregnancy vitamins while your struggling with your food and just take it as it comes remember milk cereal, fruit veg and carbs are all important to you to function and if you can manage a bit of each then thats good on top of the vitamins your be fine so just do what you can and dont stress|`|9E91O09caa	yeah, everyone is different. My first trimester I lost weight because I just couldn't eat anything or keep it down. Second trimester is definitely when I had a HUGE appetite.|`|gY3wh4psaa	I'm 20 weeks and my appetite is just starting to come back. I know it's normal cause this is my 2nd.

WPI0Z47saa	I wouldn't go with the plastic since they are sharp and they can break off in their mouths. Go in any baby section for toddler silver where. The toddler forks have shorter prongs with slightly rounded edges. They works just fine and are alot safer.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I use ones from Ikea.

lHDff8Braa	Go to the funeral, and while on the east coast, look for a different school, find a place to live and a job, and bring your mom along later.<br>  <br>  You've got to live your life for you, not your mom.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, I wasn't trying to be a jerk. I was just reading your story there and you seem trapped in a house with a bully of a dad and a dependant mom, and you sound lonely and afraid, and that's no way to live.  I apologize if I sounded insensitive, I was just trying to suggest that you have your whole life ahead of you and the place you are right now doesn't sound like a good place for you to be.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	if you're serious that you're afraid of your father becoming physically abusive, tell that to your mom.<br>  <br>  you don't have to be gone a week for a funeral even if it's on the other coast ... my spouse flew to california fro the east coast this morning and will be back tomorrow morning.  so i wouldn't be up for your missing a week's school over it, either.  whether it's worth going out for a day or two depends on how close you were to your great grandmother, but if you aren't paying your own way and your parents choose not to, there's not much you can do about that, either.<br>  <br>  i would seriously address the fears of abuse.  but the fears of being separated from your mom, if you're already 19, will be better addressed by letting her go without you.  it's not useful to be stuck to her hip into your adulthood.  how about going to stay with a friend for the week?
SrcoG7JRaa	Hm, just yesterday! Went on a date with my husband to a nice restaurant (=<br>  I dress up quite a lot, which is funny since I never, EVER did before just a couple years ago.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My first ate everything at 6 months, just a few bites most days though.  However it was clear he purposely ate as much as he wanted.<br>  <br>  My second did not swallow anything until almost 10 months, and while he enjoyed chewing food if he couldn't spit it out he would scream until I cleaned his mouth out for him!<br>  <br>  Are you using big enough pieces of food?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintroductie/blw/engels.html#choke" rel="nofollow">http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...</a><br>  There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later – usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i'm sorry, what is BLW?|`|x647LeB2aa	With my first two I did the traditional thing and pureed all the food or gave them jars from around 4 months.<br>  <br>  With my third I started to offer him food at 5.5 months and he has only had what we have had.  No pureeing this time - simply chopped small and put in front of him.<br>  <br>  He is 11 months old and eats everything.  Favourites are blueberries and grapes.  He eats a LOT but is also very active so only on the 25th centile for weight.<br>  <br>  This has been a lot easier than jars - and aside from a free one I got in my bounty pack he has not had any of these at all.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Elyse started at 6.5 months.  She would eat a bite here and there but didn't really start eating consistently until she was about 9 months old.  Then around 10 months old she started to eat a lot.  Now at 11 months old some meals she sits and eats for 45 minutes and others she mainly plays or wants out of her chair within 10 minutes.|`|h7i9Ngu9aa	ok mine ain't a personal experience but however my step mum did it with her youngest and he is perfectly fine and healthy, they say a baby always has the gag reflex so if u worried that ur baby will choke DON'T BE its a natural reaction to bring it back up if too big, start slowly with a soft mushy chip or something like that and ur baby will soon pick it up!

So glad I'm not the only one, I was thinking I was sort of crazy lol.  I would do the same thing, like find myself thinking I was feeling him kick, then realize I was holding my son.  I told my boyfriend and he about had a heart attack lol.  I had to assure him that there was no way I could be pregnant enough again to actually be feeling kicks, so it was just in my head. It is so weird though...really does feel like the kicks!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	You're not alone. Once you've been pregnant, you never forget that magical feeling.

Really scary feeling.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I've never noticed that! But it could be like remembering the feeling?  I love that feeling, well, until about week 35! lol! Then it was just plain painful lol|`|YsnY9LqIaa	Yup me too, still do at 17 months - hence having done many, many pregnancy tests since she was born, despite it being highly unlikely for me to be pregnant seeing as I haven't had my period back yet!|`|tlu9wlNAaa	my son is 13months old and i still get them they freak me out lol i miss being pregnant :( but when i was pregnant they were much harder and some used to stop me in my tracks!! i dont miss those one haha xx|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Yeah!

You are normal <br>  <br>  x|`|CJj5g3DMaa	normal|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I had my son 9 months ago, and I still feel these kicks.  And also, my incision is still numb and still feel twinges from time to time.  It is weird...and sometimes I actually wonder if I am pregnant again but I figure I would know long before feeling kicks...lol|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You are not alone. It's pretty common to feel phantom kicks. I felt them too.
oP504BtFaa	Pretty bad. I've got a cold, so it was hard falling asleep last night. Celia is also sick (which means the rest of my daughters will catch it, most likely) so she stayed home. I was exhausted all day, but had FIVE appointments with clients - that's way more than usual, so of course that happens when I'm sick! Celia's feeling better, but I am so not. My husband made chicken soup and we're about to sit down to dinner, so hopefully that will help. I'll probably take a shower after dinner and go straight to bed.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my day was great.  <br>  <br>  i'm not sure why, but all four kids seem to have been in a "zone" the last few weeks... everyone is miraculously simultaneously in a very cooperative and friendly phase.  knock on wood.<br>  <br>  plus I snuck in some caffeine that I haven't had at all in a couple months, and it really perked me up, lol.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Oh that sounds yummy. can i come to your house for dinner?<br>  <br>  my day is going ok. its 1:30 pm in Hawaii and I am at work. I just went walking with my co-worker, we jsut started this week so yay!.

You know how sometimes you just have those days where your ultra-sensitive? Today was my six year old daughter's day to do that. First thing this morning she started crying and complaining because she didn't want to go to school and she didn't like the pants she had on. She got to change her pants but went to school anyway. Then I got three phone calls from the school because she wouldn't stay in her seat or she wouldn't stop talking or she had started crying and no one could understand what was wrong.<br>  <br>  She's not sick, just having an emotional day. I kind of feel like ripping my hair out. I'm also 31 weeks pregnant and just tired, but the baby is doing well and very active today so I'm happy about that. In about an hour I'll start making dinner: sloppy joes, corn, and peaches. <br>  <br>  Have a good night! Thanks for the mini-vent!|`|RSczEcZCaa	Normally i would be cooking, doing the laundry, cleaning the house, you know mommy duties. But now it's a little more frantic! My in laws had a terrible road accident and now my husband is with them in the hospital. I have to drop my 2 younger kids off to my mother's house and take my eldest to the church for his confirmation (it's a catholic rite) and then off to the hospital later on after that. It sucks when we talk about hospitals...|`|P9k8qHP6aa	My day is crazy, as usual. I have a son who will be 6 in march, a son that will be 19 months on monday and a sob that will be 6 months old next friday (the 5th). On top of my wonderful and active kids I babysit a 5 year old boy, a 6 year old boy, a 9 year old girl and a 10 year old boy....And I wouldnt change my life for anything in the world.|`|nYioXmnGaa	My day was not horrible but then again it was not  good ! My oldest would not go on a nap today  but on the up side my youngest did ! MY oldest did not make a mess eating  his lunch  but my youngest did!!! So it all evens out when I am having a good day I always have a bad rest of the day !!|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Uuugh. It's fine now and we're going out tonight (yay!) but I was babysitting my godsons (2 and 4) and they were hyper ALL DAY, no matter how much I had them outside. On top of that, my 5 month old was a witch, and my 8 year old came from home school crying again. She's calmed down now, my godsons are out playing baseball with my husband so they're distracted, and the witching has quieted down to no more than a growl every now and then.<br>  And I'm looking forward to the Old Spaghetti Factory tonight (=<br>  Just one of those days.|`|Iv8WwN2gaa	good.<br>  my daughter made it into VARSITY for volleyball & soccer.<br>  and my son just became captain of his water polo team, and is gonna be in his first racing tournament.oh and i finally met my son's girlfriend.<br>  when my kids were at school i got some ME time.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	well, my 3 year old told me to "shut up" We were over at my friends and he took a toy from another little girl. When I told him not nice he said that. Boy, did he get in trouble! On the brighter side, I can see part of some teeth coming in for my 7 month old.
hDnX6Vx6aa	Ok... I had a UTI last month. I also had spotting so i did the Research just like you are. The spotting is most likely NOT from the UTI. There may be a small amount of blood in your pee but not when you wipe. If you are having a small amount of light pink or brownish discharge when you wipe (like i did)it is probably implantation bleeding. Hang in there and do a home test te week after your missed period. GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  PS. I tested positive last friday.
ODf41iN4aa	Just smile like Mona Lisa unless something really good comes to mind & slips out.  Or just chuckle.  That's enough of the attitude of not being too aloof.  Otherwise, it will be too strained & you'll look like you're  desperate to get in a word.  So, just listen & shine it on, while really focusing on social studies.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, as an adult there might be a different sort of one-upmanship that centers on who can remember something from the Constitution, such as how many people in each legislative body or what constitutes the each amendment, etc.  There are even radio call-ins on Presidents' Day and other holidays, with prizes like dinner for 2 for remembering this stuff.  Of course, you could always look it up on the Internet, unless the Talk Show host is waiting for you answer.  Gasp.<br>  <br>  This stuff is also handy support when giving your opinion, like on YA or if you ever become a political activist.  (Adult life is kind of unpredictable.  Forget thinking "never in a million years" would you do a certain thing.)  You may have another chance to learn it if you go to college, but you might as well enjoy the luxury now.<br>  <br>  Another thing people often wish they remembered from h.s. is biology.  (I took it 11a.m.-12 & mainly was thinking about lunch, except for the formaldehyde.)  Eventually, we all have to go to the doctor, & we don't want to look like an ignoramus when the doctor explains something.  Oh, well, most of us do anyway, but I'm just just saying, learn it & remember it if you can.<br>  <br>  So, at least sort of pay attention, & forget these jokers unless a chuckle seems natural.  Think Mona Lisa but not snobby, right?|`|nLdSwOQLaa	just ignore them, if u say something theyll pick on u 4 saying it.<br>  b urself and let the crap they say just slide off back.<br>  <br>  good luck :)!|`|O7wW0f0xaa	If they say you suck you say You Swallow!|`|Na1HDNncaa	i cant get angry at you today. its Be Kind To Animals Week.<br>  try to picture how little i care.<br>  did you take your medication today?<br>  i'll try smiling if you try being smarter(im not sure this ones that good unless they tell you to smile..lol)<br>  join the 20 firts century<br>  drop dead<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry thats all i can think of for now...lol<br>  good luck!|`|Mjni0Np3aa	your face ruined my day.<br>  so i hear you turned your girlfriend gay.<br>  you have no friends.<br>  no one cares what you say.|`|2e6i1gUaaa	your face.|`|uklVm81uaa	If they say anything to or about you say "your mom."<br>  <br>  other than that, just ignore them.|`|wE3ubrhjaa	Laugh at their jokes and they won't say as much stuff.

It didn't last throughout the entire pregnancy though. You may just have to bare through it.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	I am just the same, I feel bad for all the men of pregnant woman. lol I just hope to get through the next 7 months without killing my fiance.|`|GUUgeptjaa	Hon I hate to tell you, I have been struggling with that since the beginning of my pregnancy, all I can say is take a deeeeeep breath, I was the same as you, as calm as can be, but whew, my hormones now are out of control, if I get to out there I usually ask my hubby to do whatever needs to be done and I go and take a bath, it works.....|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I was the same way and you don't even know you are doing it until you sit back and think about what you said and feel bad right.  Well I asked my husband and anyone close to me like my mom and sister to let me know when I was becoming that way.  Then I could see when and why it was happening and I could change the way I was acting before it got out of hand.  After time I could see it on my own and change the way I was being.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	HAHA I feel your pain because im the same way. You really cant so I would just learn to deal with it for 9 months!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	Let me tell you, last year I was pregnant with our first and my husband was deployed in Iraq. I was such a mess especially at the end when I had SPD. I would go from calm to complete anger in a matter of seconds, unfortunately, my husband was at the short end of the stick, not only was he out there getting shot at when he comes online everyday to talk to me I was in a bad mood (poor baby!). I was a hellion I heard but, it wasn't like it was unprovoked either! However, I do know it was more like a flood gate of hate and anger just opens up each time.<br>  <br>  This time around, I am now 37 weeks and my husband is home and he said this pregnancy was easy! He said he was bracing himself for some hell but, nada! I think it's because I haven't been in much pain at all and I emphasize on how much I shouldn't be stressed at all.<br>  <br>  Now that I am rounding the corner, I have never gotten this far in any of my pregnancies, I am getting more irritable again. Well, it's sort of hard when I have contractions too lol!!<br>  <br>  We just need to breathe and take it easy. Count backwards from 1-10. Just let your husband know that you are extremely irritable right now and that he should brace himself for a little turbulence.
aLAmvX5Naa	That is how children should be raised. They aren't babies, its good you don't baby them. They will learn these skills now so as adults they continue to eat healthy food, continue to comb their hair and dress nice, etc. Its a good thing.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Sounds to me like you're doing the right things.  My theory is have very few rules, but of the rules you have make it clear they are to be obeyed.|`|64OsCr8laa	no thats how i was raised i never missed school until i they found out i have migranes they were so bad i threw up all day and i would get them every 2 months at this piont i had to stay home for like 2 days per headache!!! it was terrible. so just watch thier medical needs but other then that you are doing great|`|66Z7kr1Taa	More parents need to be like you. Boys are becoming weak and this touchy feely parenting just confuses them. It just makes life harder for them as they get older. I think teen suicide is common because these sheltered kids just can deal with the real world.|`|0i89eW8kaa	Noo that is perfect. THat was how i was raised and it kept me in school and getting good grades. If you were too relaxed bout the sick part they would try to fake sickness to stay out of school which i tried once|`|drI1vsJdaa	Not at all! As long as they know you love them, and know they can tell you stuff without you overreacting, then you're just fine! :)
1G3XPiq3aa	I smack my daughter when she does something dangerous. A quick hard smack on the back of the hand with she goes to touch the power points or something like that, so she associates doing dangerous things with getting hurt. Otherwise, I generally don't.<br>  <br>  Grocery stores are nightmares with kids. I wouldn't say anything if I saw a parent smacking their kid. It's usually far more embarrassing for the parent than it is for the child. I often will stop if it looks like they're having trouble, and say to the child in a stern voice "listen to your mother", as they will usually be shocked a stranger has told them off and stop. People have with my daughter before too, and I've always been very thankful.<br>  <br>  I don't think spanking a child harms their self esteem. Obviously if it's excessive, or too hard then it has the same effect as any other form of abuse though. I was spanked occasionally as a child, and it certainly had no long lasting effect on me.|`|ENANtueuaa	I have never spanked my daughter. I did swat at her "diaper butt" when she was a toddler. Not to hurt her, more to make her aware of what she was doing, and she never cried. I used it mostly when she was climbing on something she shouldn't be, like "hey, get down from there." I've also smacked her hand for almost touching things that are dangerous, like trying to pull out an outlet cover. I had an open mind about spanking, i said i would do it if i HAD to, and as a last resort when all else fails. I was abused as a child, and never wanted my child to have the same kind of childhood i had. I make sure she listens and she knows i mean business, but i don't need to spank her to get her to listen to me. It's a long process to not spank...i mean i could just spank and "get it over with" but i prefer to talk to my child and let her know that it's not ok to do those things, and use time outs and take toys away instead.<br>  <br>  I have friends who spank, and i find nothing wrong with it, every child is different. The only time i see it as abuse, is when the child is constantly being hit and yelled at with no love, hugs, kisses, and positive reinforcement.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	My opinion is, I will not spank my children.  I may swat her hand if she reached for something hot or something dangerous, but I will not use spanking as a form of punishment.  If I saw someone spanking their kids in the grocery store, I wouldn't say anything to them unless it was abusive.  I DO think spanking harms a child's self esteem and I NEVER want my children to fear me physically or think that I will ever hurt them.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	spanking is just fine! you can and should spank your child/ren. however, that should be used if firstly they aren't listening. the 1st time they act up you say we don't_____! if you do it again i'm spanking you. then follow through. don't keep warning and threatening cuz kids a yr and older can and  will pick up on that. if you say your gonna spank them, then don't do it, they will never take you seriously. don't listen to any1 who doesn't spank. i wouldn't be surprised if there kids are hellions.<br>  <br>  if i saw a person spanking there child in the store, i would keep to myself. its not abuse and its none of my business.<br>  <br>  it doesn't harm self esteem. what will harm self esteem is letting your kids get by w/ whatever they want b/c "nothing works" and they refuse to resort to spanking, when that would instantly solve the problem.<br>  <br>  it doesn't teach violence either. any1 who tells that to you is full of it. if it encouraged violence then the "violent" teenagers and adults that are/were bullys would be spanking others instead ok punching them in the mouth ect. lol. often its the kids who weren't spanked that end up being rude, violent and impolite adults b/c  they have never been made to do right from wrong.<br>  <br>  sure some times you can get by timing out or scolding. but all kids have there stubborn moments. and thats the times when if its time to spank-DO IT!!!! don't threaten, don't say "your making mommy sad" they don't care at that point. you're making them mad. spanking will get you good kids, not spanking will not. period.|`|AA11920812	Generally, no. <br>  <br>  My oldest has night terrors. Those are caused by fear. Once I connected the spankings with the night terrors - the night terrors stopped. Perhaps, some kids aren`t as sensative as mine. I`m just thankful that I don`t have to deal with them any more.<br>  <br>  We use time outs in a corner one minute every year of age. It works. I just have to be consistant. It does try my patience and some days I feel like they are in the corner from the time they get up to the time they go down for a nap. But, at the end of the day I am glad my hands weren`t beating their butts. JUST my opinion.<br>  <br>  Yes, for extremes they will get a spanking. Example, my oldest figured out the locks on the front door. He stripped down to his boxers grabbed his crocs and went outside. I had his brother in a high chair and I grabbed the hotdogs from the fridge (hadn`t put them in the toaster oven yet). And it was TOO quiet. I checked real quick and noticed the front door was WIDE open. I ran outside it was silent. I called and called no response. I ran out back to the swing set and he wasn`t there. I called again no response. I ran to our neighbors deck and called out and I hear *Mommy I right here*. <br>  <br>  There my boy was on the deck in only his unders and crocs playing on the deck. I was so relieved, but I had to spank to instill a fear in him. It is very dangerous for a two year old to escape from his home. And lots of crazies. In fact, a few houses over there is a sexual predator. I`d rather spank than be the mother of the next Haleigh Cummings :((((|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well i do prefer time out etc...however if my daughter decided to run across a road that was busy i would spank her there and then and explain why her behaviour was unacceptable.....i wouldnt stand her on the pavement for a minute of year of her life. somethings i think it can be appropriate ie play with matches etc  and i do not think its psychologically damaging either|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	I have two kids and both of them have been spanked some. I dont spank my kids until I have tried the time out method first. Then if the repeat the offense that is when they get the spanking. But I always make sure that I am calm before I spank my kids. I was spanked as a child and it did not do anything to me but made me a better person. I don't believe in spanking my child in a public place, but if my kids were doing something that was going to harm them or other people then I might consider a spanking. But I would just keep walking if I saw a parent spank their child, cause it is none of my business. This is just my 2 cents on spanking.|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	Theres a difference between spanking and beating your child. I swat my daughter when she misbehaves and she starts behaving. I dont think it hurts a childs self esttem to be disciplined when they act badly. I have a friend that threatens to spank her kids and never does and those kids are BAD they break stuff and cus and are just out of control but their parents don't believe in spanking. So instead they threaten to spank them when they're bad and the kids just dont care they still do what they want. That's exactly what I dont want my kids to be like so a swat when they're bad is a necessity in my opinion. As for swatting your kid in public I guess it just depends on what the kid was doing to deserve it.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I think it is a very good form of punishment.  My brother and I were spanked when we were young and we grew up to be rather good kids.  My stepbrothers were never spanked and were only given 'timeouts' and they were/are brats.<br>  <br>  If I saw someone doing it to their kid in a grocery store I wouldn't be offended.  Sometimes it is the only way.  As some had said earlier, of course I will see if it is turning into something more.  I think it is better than some examples I see where the kid is screeching and the mother is just going on shopping as though she doesn't notice and everyone else is left to be deafened by the ear-popping scream.<br>  <br>  I would always fear when my mom started rattling around in the cupboard for the wooden spoon.  As I found out later, sometimes she would just act like she was getting the spoon and I would stop doing the bad thing I was doing, I guess it worked!<br>  <br>  I think you should only spank them in public when they are too young to be embarrassed by it (to protect their self-esteem) but in the privacy of your own home I think you can do it until they are older.  I would have been pretty embarrassed if my mom did it to me in front of my friends when I was 6 or 7.<br>  <br>  I can't remember the age I was when my mom stopped using spanking, maybe 6 or so.  I really don't remember.<br>  <br>  And it didn't ruin my relationship with my mom and dad or anything.  I will use it on my kids.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Yes I spank my children , but they get chances first. Usually its 3 strikes and your out! UNLESS it is something very bad. like sticking something in an outlet , or running outside with no parent ...my kids would get the @$$ beat sorry to say it like that but it would hurt because its dangerous and I would want to scare them. <br>  If I saw someone spanking there child in the grocery store I would mind my own business , I do not do that , but I do pinch if needed. <br>  I do not think it harms the self esteem , I was spanked and it didn't effect me , I believe it is what made me a good kid. <br>  Another way of punishing I do with my child , if my son tells me no its a drop of hot sauce on the tongue , its works wonders ....and wait 30sec b4 getting them something to drink , my mom did soap but for some reason that doesn't bug my son , but hot sauce does!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I think spanking (if done correctly) is an effective method of punishing. <br>  If i saw some one spanking in a grocery store i would mind my own business, as long as it didn't cross into abuse. <br>  No spanking doesn't harm self esteem (it didn't hurt mine or anyone else's i know)|`|98tnx1Uhaa	yes I spank my children only when needed. Trust me they get lots of warnings before I spank, Sometimes that is the only way they will listen. <br>  If I saw someone giving a spanking in the grocery store I would not say nothing unless they where beating on their kid. I dont think it hurts there self esteem.|`|iwUInpC1aa	Slap on the backside never done me any harm.<br>  Slap on the backside never done my daughter no harm. <br>  <br>  I think we are now, because of the stupid laws,  too soft on kids and this is why there is so much trouble on the streets.<br>  <br>  Bring back punishment.<br>  Bring back the cane into schools.<br>  Let the Police control a child as they think fit if it is doing wrong - the way it used to be.<br>  <br>  The world would be a much better place.|`|ELg8s7zqaa	yes i spank my son when he needs it ...(especially if he doesnt listen to me after I tell him to do something or if its something bad..)<br>  If I saw someone spanking there child I would mind my own business unless they were beating them ..<br>  No I don't  think spanking a child hurts their self esteem..I got spankings when I was growing up and it never hurt mine ...|`|CyG2YDI3aa	Yes, I spank my girls.<br>  If I saw someone spanking their kids in the grocery store I don't think I would think anything of it.<br>  I would keep to myself.<br>  No, I do not think spanking harms a child's self esteem.

We could spend all night doing extra homework. Too sick to go to school? No problem, Mom understands, you can stay in bed all day, no games, no tv, no books, too sick for school is too sick for other things. Time to rest, and regain strength. Nothing like some bland chicken broth for lunch and dinner to help that sensitive stomach. Some dry toast for breakfast. <br>  <br>  Also, you can remind him, he's 9, the baby isn't. What does he get to do that the baby doesn't? Does he really want to be the baby and miss out on all that good stuff?|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Find ut if something is going on at school.  maybe he's being bullied or teased.  Does he go to daycare or anything?  Maybe another adult is hurting him in some way.  Talk to him and see if he will open up.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	How old is he?|`|C7y6WEVxaa	Okay here is the thing my daughter is about 7 years old and when i tell her to do something she gives me a rude and flappent answer.I always tell her nt to talk to me like that,and she sais okay.But the next day will come and it will happen again.Usually in this case you need to stop playing the "love" game with him and step up to the part when your in control.When he is jealous,violent,or just answering back your not suppost to tell him how much you love him,your suppost to discipline and tell him that is not okay and put him in time out,but when Im in public and theres no time outs I just embaresse and pop there buts.This is why we love our kiddies:)|`|auutSNQzaa	kick his butt into place... stop being nice if its pitty me...

My parents did it to me.. In a very harsh way.. and it worked.. and it worked well..|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Spend some one on one time with him.

Try doing something that involves both of them interacting together and praise them both..|`|G2auAv1Saa	First find out if something is up at school. There may be an incident you are unaware of. However, if you find nothing wrong you can try what my mom did to me. <br>  When I went through this stage she took me to a mission and showed me people who really were sick, and had nothing because they didn't care to go to school.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	How old is your son. How much time do you spend with him one on one?<br>  It's all a matter of jealousy. Just keep reassuring him and try to spend at least 1/2 an hour ofuninterruptedd time with him every day, and maybe have a "date" with him 1-2 times a month where just the two of you go to lunch or somewhere fun.

I was soo happy I stuck it out :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Never had a problem actually, until they had teeth and tried them out on me once.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	Only one of my 3 was I in pain.  It was only for two weeks, Ussually pain indicates a latching problem.  Most women who are first time moms thing it hurts but htye are associating the pain to engorgement. (which happens for everyone nursing or not) That pain is also gone within the first two -3 weeks|`|wFVLP5l3aa	till between 1-2 months my nippels were cracked bad and i had to use a nipple shield which hurt cause it pulls the nipples out too far once i stoped that its great<br>  now the only time it hurts is when he chomps down hard or pulls them|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I guess I was one of the lucky ones b/c I never had any pain.

I had a little spell about six weeks in when I had very dry and slightly cracked nipples, but La Leche League ladies suggested some cream that cleared it right up so I never felt any real pain from it. <br>  <br>  I look forward to having another baby and getting to experience breastfeeding and the bond with my child again. It's so wonderful!|`|p2gMf7JIaa	oh gosh, i was the same way. it was about 6-8 weeks for me also. it would feel like i was over the pain after just a couple weeks, but then it would come back and i would be SO MAD.  but now, just like you, smooth sailing.<br>  i was going back and fourth between pumping and nursing but i FINALLY found my groove and nurse full time and would not have it any other way.

j2mRop0laa	Is it the competition thing? I know I'm being nosy. :p<br>  <br>  Uhm, well mostly my husband and I share the general outline of values and education etc for the girls. There are times when I think my ideas of how things should be might bother my husband a little but not enough to get sad over. <br>  <br>  If it's that big of a gap for you, then yes.. it is sad. I'm sorry you feel that way, really. It must suck.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I understand, completely!

That's PART of the reason why we're exes.  It's sad to me, however, that becoming exes seems to be the most popular way to  handle marital differences, or, seemingly, the only way.  I'm sure God had something else in mind when He said something about ". . . till death do us part".  Oh well, we've blown Him off many times before.  I guess He's used to it by now.   God Bless you.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	It's hard, to be sure. One of the things I disagreed with my spouse about was having guns in the house. He wanted them, I didn't.

You may find that you can both compromise on some aspects and talk through the ones you really disagree on .<br>  Good luck and **hugs**<br>  <br>  Although he isn;t the childrens father 5 years is long enough for tem to regard him as such. Is the problem stemming from the fact that either or both of you resent the factthe children aren't his?? I mean do you not like him to discepline or maybe he is unsure of his real role ?? Its a complicated thought process.<br>  Re: damaging your children by calling it a day, many children (my husbands childhood included) would have prefered seperated but happy and calm parents rather than warring ones.

miFe45quaa	Madeleine (I prefer this) is French. It's pronounced in several ways:<br>  <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/madeleine" rel="nofollow">http://www.behindthename.com/name/madele...</a><br>  <br>  Madeline is English. It too is pronounced in several ways:<br>  <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/madeline" rel="nofollow">http://www.behindthename.com/name/madeli...</a><br>  <br>  I would spell it the way you prefer. Madelyn is obviously pronounced (Mad-uh-lyn). Madeleine/Madeline is NOT pronounced (Mad-uh-lyn). If it were, it would be spelled like Madelyn/Madalyn. <br>  <br>  It's all about preference. But if she grows and tells people her middle name, and they pronounce it wrong, she'll just tell them "No, it's MAD-uh-LINE."|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I prefer the Madeline spelling, I would pronounce it the way that you are wanting it to be pronounced, and it is simpler that way. I think that it is cute, but it is not my favorite name.

AA11208683	here are some tips to figure out the difference between urine and amniotic fluid....<br>  - amniotic fluid has more of a sweet smell to it where as urine has the harsher odor of ammonia<br>  - if you change your underwear and wipe and you are still leaking a pale, straw-colored fluid, which wont run dry because it continues to be produced, replacing itself every few hours<br>  - if you are sitting on the toilet and its coming out of you try stopping it, if it stops it's urine if it doesn't its amniotic fluid.<br>  usually if the baby's head is down it acts like a cork, so you will leak a lot more laying down than you will sitting or standing, try laying down and see what happens. you could have peed and not known it, it is possible. i hope this helps... good luck. and if you think its amniotic fluid call your doctor, and don't put anything up there or have sex.|`|MPIcqhTHaa	I know is going to sound gross, but one way to help you find out is to smell it. Yes, smell it. If it has a sweet smell to it, or none at all, it may be amniotic fluid. If it has an ammonia smell to it, it's probably urine. What you do want to do though, is call your doctor. Especially if it is a steady trickle. If it was urine you shouldn't be leaking anymore, but if your water broke, you will continue to leak as the fluid is constantly being replaced. Do call your doctor very soon though!|`|PtH1YPA9aa	around that time my sister and myself BOTH had that. I didnt feel like i peed or was sweating and went in to the hospital 2 different times and both times it was not amniotic fluid. I think you just get watery discharge or something. I would call your midwife or ob anyway cause you could have a slow leak. You will know when your water breaks so i doubt its that. When my water broke i actually heard a pop and it was enough water to fill a 16 oz cup or more.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Oh boy....GO TO THE DOCTOR OR ER!!!!  That sounds like your water is leaking or has broken!  Go to the ER and get it checked out ASAP!  Good luck!!!  This is one of those things you don't want to just 'sit around and see what happens!'  If your leaking amniotic fluid you run the risk of not only preterm labor and possibly delivering a premature baby, but you also run the risk and possibility of infection!  Good luck!|`|r0J738Ckaa	You need to contact your obgyn.  If you are only 31 weeks you probably need to go to the hospital.  Don't want to lose that amniotic fluid around the baby.|`|avkZGv1taa	I would definitely contact your doctor--you may be leaking amniotic fluid and that can be dangerous... get checked as soon as possible.|`|xKklR2inaa	Probably nothing but I would call your doctor.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Could just be watery discharge, but call your doctor just in case. At least then you can set your mind at ease or go in if she recommends it.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Sounds like amniotic fluid - you should call your Dr immediately|`|Ms8b2kISaa	You should put a call in to your doctor just to be on the safe side, but it's pretty normal to have all kinds of crazy discharges down there during pregnancy. I had so many colors and consistencies while I was pregnant, I could write a book! The doctor told me that they were all completely fine, as long as none of them were accompanied by any pain worse than mild menstrual cramps, and as long as none of it was pinkish or red, which could obviously indicate blood. Call to make sure, but I think you're OK! Congrats and good luck!!!|`|52U22fiAaa	It could be your water, since it can drip and not gush when it breaks.  When I was pregnant with my first, I had the same thing happen to me, but it was just lubrication (lots of it) from the hormones in my body and being so close to full term.  However, the only way I knew that it WASN'T amniotic fluid was because I got examined.  It's best to know for sure, so please go to your Triage/ER/Doctor to have them look at you.|`|qFvHH6lUaa	That sounds like amniotic fluid leakage to me.  Call your doctor.  He/she will probably send you to labor and delivery for tests.  Good luck.|`|G3PsxUsWaa	It could be that. Or it could be that you didn't notice you wet your pants. Or another possiblity can be that your water did break and your spotting.
WPI0Z47saa	1. yes<br>  2. yes<br>  3. yes<br>  4. both since it is healthier for the child|`|TsjqzanQaa	As a victim of circumcision, I feel my comments here are pertinent.<br>  <br>  My own father was intact, which was never an issue.<br>  As a child, I saw my father a couple of times getting out of the shower, and this I never gave a thought about the difference between us.<br>  <br>  I never realized what circumcision was until into my teens, and didn't even think much about the difference at the time.<br>  <br>  Having been unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex when I became sexually active, I had no idea what the problem was.<br>  <br>  Years later, I found out about foreskin restoration, and the improvement of sexual sensitivity, and this has changed my life completely.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is male genital mutilation, which always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It usually destroys about 50-75% of sexual sensitivity and more in some cases, like mine.<br>  <br>  Most circumcised males don't realize that their sensitivity has been diminished, as sex still feels good to them, and they have no concept of how it is really supposed to feel with an intact and whole penis, with a foreskin; the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  The majority of men in the world are uncircumcised, which is the natural state of a man.<br>  <br>  Very, very few men ever actually choose to be circumcised, most circumcised men had this forced on them as infants, when they couldn't choose for themselves, and couldn't defend themselves against this assault.<br>  <br>  Circumcision has no medical benefits, and in fact circumcised males are more susceptible to HIV and other diseases.       The USA has had a high rate of circumcision in the past, and also one of the highest rates of HIV; much more, in fact than in any of the countries of Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia where circumcision is rarely done.<br>  <br>  Pakistan, for example, has a circumcision rate of about 90% and an HIV rate 400% greater than neighboring India, where the vast majority of men are uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  Many of the individuals extolling the "benefits" of circumcision have never indeed seen an unmutilated penis, and some think that they look "weird."<br>  <br>  In most of the rest of the world, a circumcised penis, with its scarred and incomplete appearance is considered weird.<br>  <br>  Have you ever wondered why doctors never disclose and in fact suppress, the adverse effects and complications from circumcision?<br>  <br>  Other medical procedures require informed consent, yet doctors never discuss the diminished sensitivity issue nor the psychological effects that result from victim's of circumcision discovering what was done to them as infants.<br>  <br>  Female circumcision of minors is illegal in all civilized countries, and rightfully so, as it's genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  Male circumcision is male genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  There is no difference; genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	1.

Jayden's father is not in the picture, and I knew he wouldn't be. So even though he technically he "looks like daddy (minus the hair and a lot of size of course!)" it doesn't matter. He will probably never see his fathers genitals. My boyfriend now, who is circumcised, is much more of a father to Jayden than Brad will ever be.<br>  <br>  2. Have you ever seen a non circumcised penis (besides your sons)?<br>  yes<br>  <br>  3. Is your son circumcised?<br>  HELL NO!!!!<br>  <br>  4. Who's decision was it yours or the babies father weather or not to circumcise?<br>  Mine<br>  <br>  I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) Is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? Telling your son that self esteem comes from other people is one of the worst things you can do! If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis, they are the ones missing peices....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...

0SIhrYCbaa	Congrats Mama! Isn't it wonderful to hear? She may call the cat that but its OK. She does know its you just has no other words.<br>  My youngest son never crawled. Well he did about 14 months when he saw other babies doing it. But he was already walking.<br>  Some kids don't crawl. My daughter used to sit up and turn toward the other direction and lay back down. Then she'd sit up again and turn the other way. She was moving just not crawling. But she got where she wanted to go. I think that started around 8 months or so and she walked a month later. <br>  Just let your baby do what she wants. Crawling is only important to parents comparing milestones. <br>  Let her cruise on the table if she likes. In a couple of months she'll be running around and you'll wish for this time. <br>  Enjoy her, I promise it goes way too fast.|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is still early so you are good. If you feel that she is having problems with the flooring then they do sell knee pads for babies who are learning to crawl. You can also buy a cheap area rug to practice on or better yet I just to put those foam squares down on the floor. They are about 3/4 inch thick and are also great for when they are learning to walk because if they fall they are cushioned. Hope this helps.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Try making some knee pads for her to wear.  Have you tried crawling on the floor to see what she is feeling?|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	Oh my gosh!  My daughter is 8 1/2 months old and isn't crawling and I worry that our hardwoods are affecting this too!  How weird!  I too am a first time mommy and worry about all things like this.  I read that as long as they are mobile in some sort of way they are fine.  My daughter scoots backwards but I can't help but think that our floors are the reason she isn't full fledge crawling.  When I take her to my moms (who has carpet) she can get up to crawl and everything, she just doesn't go.  It still nags in the back of my mind sometimes b/c she has been sooo advanced in everything, talking, teething, sitting up, and rolling over, but oh well, maybe our babies will walk before they crawl.  I am, however, going to ask her pediatrician at her 9 month check up.  Good luck to you and your baby.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	We have hardwood, no carpets (except in the bedrooms, which we are in very seldom).  My son didn't crawl until he was 10 months old.  And even then, he did a sort of monkey scamper (on his bottom) and never really "crawled."  He walked then at 13 months.  I don't think hardwood has anything to do with it.  Kids just develop at their own pace (and some never crawl at all)!  I need to remember my own advice sometimes!  <br>  I'd say just to let her do her own thing -- she'll get there!|`|HXz7QYoXaa	My son did the same thing.  He was in a home with concrete floors in India and only a small rug in the living room.  He was a professional roller.  He rolled everywhere.  Then he started creeping along furniture.  He started walking by the end of the 8th month and did not learn to crawl until after one year old.  Good luck!  Maybe you will just have an early walker!!|`|sRjURY43aa	do they have a big bed? Maybe you could try something on that. If you wanted to skip the crawling stage that fine too! Some kids dont like to crawl|`|yYGc1FNAaa	just give it some more time<br>  <br>  -kathy|`|WlU3NFu6aa	they make knee pads for babies. and she very well might skip crawling and go to walking. My daughter crawled on tiled floors with no problems. their little knees are very chubby and padded
Zi6Fr49Laa	Yeah, in your first trimester your hormones are going nuts and your face breaks out. For me it settled down and my skin looked great in my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Then I had my baby and my "you're not pregnant anymore" hormones went nuts and my skin broke out again.|`|1S5AbPueaa	The hormones girl blame it on the hormones.When I was pregnant with my second ...omgosh I looked like a middle school pizza face.It was ridiculous, but it gets better and you will soon have the pregnancy glow minus the pizza face;)|`|Gr78AFvyaa	IT sucks but it is totally normal...It is caused by all the hormones. I had perfect skin too until I got pregnant. I even broke out inbetween my breasts...I am 2 weeks post partum and it is slowly going away...there is hope at the end!!|`|WPI0Z47saa	Yep hormones. It happens to alot of women.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	perfectly normal. hormones are a pain. be lucky if you don't also get the hair in the wrong places...like the chin...|`|DfFq0N3Xaa	your hormones are going crazy perhaps....<br>  use an astrigent or such a concoction to take care of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  congrats on the baby, too!|`|A0tWlG94aa	it's your hormones.... congrats btw<br>  x|`|SohrsIBoaa	It's your hormones. It's completely normal and will happen probably until after the baby is born. Go pick up some books on pregnancy and learn about all the stuff your body does/goes through while your pregnant. It's extremely interesting. Good luck with the little one! =)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Hormones. I had the same thing with all three of my kids but my face went back to normal after I had them. I didn't even get any scarring from the pimples. Get a good cleanser that isn't too harsh on the skin. I use noxzema on mine and it works great!!
LbNXxRXnaa	Well honesty, i doubt you hate her. it's hard to hate your parents unless they do something really terrible to you, like rape or murder or something extreme. You may not like them at times, I do the same with my parents. <br>  <br>  But yeahh that is very unfair and not immature of you. You should talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  :D|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	your 13|`|aZC4QoIUaa	I think that you are immature, but after all, you are 13. The problem is that your Mom seems to be more immature than you are. There is not too much you can do about that, but do everything you can to maintain a good relationship with your Dad.|`|MeYILJeSaa	I've never met a 13 year old girl who DOESN'T hate her mother. You're immature because you're 13. I have also never met a 13 year old girl who ISN'T immature.|`|RYiSYJvTaa	Your not immature. Trust me. I've seen it from my moms point of veiw. You deep down have to lvoe her a little but not really love love. You know what I mean. Great question too! :)
Z1e3Cxjoaa	I know two people who had low progesterone and went on a prescription and both are still very much pregnant.|`|96HWpdkFaa	They could put you on something called prometruim to keep your levels up if it gets bad.

If you like the name then definitely put it on your list!! :)<br>  Since the name is celtic I'd go with a celtic middle name as well. The only one that stood out to me on your list was Reagan.

98WKYtfwaa	It's actually near impossible to feel your cervix by yourself, why would you even try and do this? You can do alot of damage, especially when you're pregnant. <br>  <br>  I heard that your cervix doesn't fully close up, it stays open a tiny bit, but you should call your doctor and ask them about this. You'll probably get a lecture about how you shouldn't go feeling around in there because of the damage you can do though.|`|ew0FaElzaa	No you shouldn't and you shouldn't be trying to stick your fingers in your cervix either.

WPI0Z47saa	When my son was born my 2 himalayan cats were 3 and 4 years old and I wasn't sure how they were going to react. They ended up being great. They would sniff him and all but if he moved they would back off. As he got mobile they would sit and watch him but keep there distance. Now my son is 3 and they actually go into his room when I open the door in the morning and jump up on his bed purring. They will let him pet them even though he ca be a little rough sometimes. We just bought him his own kitten so it would be used to being with young kids from the beginning and he loves her. They play all of the time and I never heard him laugh so much. I am pregnant with number 2 right now and when this one gets older and not awkward on the stairs, we are hoping to add a puppy. I thnk it is important for kids to be around animals and it is definitely a great benefit to everyone.|`|xBH4O6Cwaa	Our dog was always extremely patient with my little sister. I can remember her drawing "tiger stripes" on her with permanent marker, putting make-up on her, painting her nails, and one time I walk ed in to find her standing on the dogs ribs trying to reach a toy on the couch. My cat however is a different. When Shyanne hadn't been walking for long I heard this scratching noise and the cat hissing. I went into the kitchen to find Shyanne dragging the cat behind her by her tail and the cat frantically scratching the floor trying to get away. 10 years later and my cat still hates her|`|Vad64Jjoaa	We have 2 dogs, a Pomeranian and a Mastiff.

Just the last two weeks she has shown interest in the dog so we have the dog come and sit by her so she can touch her nose.  Roxy is fine with it. She also knows where the baby is at all times, she used to love to play outside but since we brought the baby home, if the baby is not at day care the dog wants no part of being outside, she has to be in where the baby is.  She will  even lay down next to the baby when the baby is playing on her floor mat.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I have a 2 pound chiuahuah named "lucy" and my 7 month old son Jackson, grabs her and squeezes as hard as he can, he steals all her toys. And she still loves him so much, she will go bring him her toys for him to throw it. The other day I caught Jackson in her bed and she was licking him in the face. It was too cute.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Our twins are 6 months old so they are not all that mobile yet . . . but our cat does go up to them occassionally and gives them a quick sniff.  That is about it for now . . . . I have a feeling that we will be finding the cat under our bed or on top of the fridge a lot once they get moving.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	Our dog stays as far away as he possibly can from our 5 1/2 month old.  It's probably a good thing.  He's not the friendliest (our dog that is), and we are going to have to be extremely cautious when our son learns to crawl/walk.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	We have a Lab and she is the sweetest girl in the world. She usually lays near the baby and whenever he makes a peep she runs to check on him. Its so cute.|`|i7nEgSW1aa	Yes babies make great pets, make sure to feed them though.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	no not really|`|Fd4lITkvaa	We have a lot of pets, 4 cats, 3 dogs. It's been mixed. I try my best to make sure my son is nice to them but it's not always possible and after I have stopped my son from pulling hair 12 times in 3 minutes I sometimes let natural consequences happen, yes he has been scratched. For the most part the cats and one of my dogs steer clear of him. I have one dog that loves him but does give that look like, "Mom! Aren't you going to save me?". My last dog is a toy poodle that is known not to do well with kids so for the most part I don't allow them together at all or for very limited amounts of time. They will do fine together once my son is old enough to not pull tails but for now it's the way it needs to be for both of them. I can't have my son hurting my 9lb dog and I can't have my dog biting my son.<br>  <br>  Other than a few admittedly deserved scratches everyone has done great together.|`|nmu6coapaa	We have a 6 month old dog and shes very protective of my son. If anyone comes into the house that she doesn't know she'll sit up dead straight beside whoever is holding him or sits in front of his bouncer if he's in that!
n0PwNx6Raa	She doesn't own the name, go for it|`|CscNjMzwaa	I don't think so, it is a beautiful name. If it were me, I wouldn't care what anyone thinks. You love the name, that's all that counts.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	If she's a friend of a friend, and not even really a friend, I'd say go for it!<br>  <br>  If you've had your heart set on it for years, it's special to you and you should go for it.<br>  <br>  If anyone asks, you can tell them  it's been your favorite name since childhood.  <br>  <br>  And who cares what others think?  Go for it! Good luck :o)|`|kwMuRDFjaa	If you like the name Lisette, then go for it. YOU have your reasons on why you chose the name, and you know deep in your heart you didn't copy her name to begin with.|`|L6U1joGAaa	I think you need to just go for it and if for some crazy reason she actually believes you got the name from her, then I'm sure every person she knows will know just how petty she is and no one will care what she has to say about it. I know a Lisette so it's not the most common name but not uncommon either. If it makes you feel better spell it differently.|`|S7jhThbmaa	They might see it that way but who cares what they think!  You said it yourself, you've loved it since you were 11 y/o.  Now, don't use it if when you say the name it brings up negative feelings from the past.  I think is a beautiful name. :)|`|X77Kzh7baa	it's fine...<br>  <br>  it's a very nice name<br>  <br>  <br>  i doubt she'll ever know and/or care and even if she does just let her know that it was in no way because of her...|`|zZ3MGvPHaa	GO FOR IT
P544Sbmqaa	If I honestly had to worry about that, he would no longer be my spouse.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	oh no no no. my husband sees his daughter as his daughter and not in any way sexual. in fact he told me (jokingly) that he hopes she's a lesbian cause he cant deal with the idea of her with a man.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No, I doubt my husband is in any way sexually attracted to his daughter.<br>  <br>  If I were to divorce and start dating again... I would just be very careful about who I dated.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I have boys but even if we did have a girl this would be the last thing on my husbands mind.<br>  <br>  Sorry but this IS a sick question.|`|723QHuicaa	Its only a concern if you choose to have a baby with a man you do not trust. i chose the father of my child wisely - I love him and I trust him.<br>  <br>  Thats like saying you would have sexual feeling toward your son - so if you were brestfeeding him, would it turn you on? I doubt it and I really hope not.<br>  <br>  It really p*sses me off that people are so quick to sexualise and demonise an innocent father daughter relationship like all mean who father girls *must* be some sort of sexual predator. Its disgusting.<br>  <br>  My Bf showers with our daughter once in a while - he holds her up washes her hair, sits down in the bath with her, washes her, then I get her out and dry and dress her. it suits us if we are in a hurry to get out. Yes she does usually have a bath, but it takes 30min for the boiler to heat our water. People, particularly on this board see it as some sort of sexual act, but those same people think its ok for a woman to bathe with her son - I just dont get that at all.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I don't have a daughter yet, but I've thought about this question before too. My mother raised me to be suspicious of all men, she used to ask me a couple of times if my father had ever touched me inappropiately. He never did. But it wasn't very comfortable for me to grow up in a house where my mother was constantly on the lookout and watching to see if my dad would touch me. To this day I find it hard to sit close to him or hug him because I see my mother in the background staring at us with a question mark on her face. My mother was molested repeatedly by her mother's boyfriend when she was growing up. So that explains it.<br>  <br>  I don't think I'd be worried about my husband having thoughts about our daughter if we ever have one. However, I love to tease my husband about our future daughter's friends. I can just imagine some overly developed 17 year old girl staying overnight and walking around half naked. I tell my husband I'll snap his neck if he even looks. We have some good laughs over that.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that if you ever feel your husband or boyfriend may be thinking inappropriately about your daughter, DON'T tell your daughter. Don't raise your daughter to feel uncomfortable with her father or father figure. Good luck.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	that thought as never once occurred to me. a father doesn't usually think that way about his daughter he is more prone to want to kill someone who thinks of his daughter in that way. if you are having thoughts like that maybe you should go see a counselor. i am NOT trying to be mean to you but there must be something behind that thought.|`|AA11481889	I wouldn't marry and breed with a man I didn't know to be decent and honest.<br>  <br>  You can *sigh* all you want....I'm not naive...I'm thorough.  <br>  <br>  If you're married to someone of whom you can actually entertain that fear as a valid concern...then you're married to someone you shouldn't be having children with.|`|prqrQcd1aa	NO...and honestly if I had any kind of inclination to feel that way towards him..He'd be out the damn door so fast he wouldn't know what to do...<br>  <br>  I"m going to be honest here though... I had a friend once that gave me a weird kind of vibe on this, then said something weird to me one day about my daughter sitting with her legs spread... Well, needless to say I had a talk to my daughter that day about good touch and bad touch and made shure that nothing was ever done to her...and i've not spoken to him since that day!|`|JK2RvliYaa	I'm not a parent but I always wonder how single mothers can live with men the hardly know & are not wed to. Besides putting the children at risk it gives kids mixed up ideas about how relationships progress healthily.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	um no.  that's gross.  if i had any thought in my mind that my husband had sexual thoughts about our daughters, i wouldn't be with him.  he is a good man and a wonderful father.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	If I ever have a girl I really don't think I would ever be concerned about that. I wouldn't marry someone I would be afraid to leave my babies alone with.|`|Btsctjydaa	Yes, your worrying about it will control their thoughts. Keep up the good work.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	no|`|2YBwc4LFaa	I think with all the media attention on things like this happening some can't help to think about the possibility of something happening. I also think that it probably happens more often with women who were sexually abused or had someone close to them abused. I personally worry about what ANY man is thinking when he looks at my daughter. It's sad but true.|`|d1862ba8e4c727c54e3035f0293c5a14aa	I think it's less likely for a father to feel this way, but it does happen. Gross or not. I don't think this way of my husband, but I make sure now that my daughter is a teen that she covers up after her shower. My Mom was molested by a sf and so it's not so uncommon. She then never dated till we were grown after her divorce because of that. Our prinicipal at our school was caught with 2 sixteen year olds and went to jail. It does happen although I don't think at all my husband would ever do such a thing. I have watched him when my daughter was younger and would come from the shower and he never turned to look at her or showed any weird interest. I would never just blow it off though and think a guys not like that...I'd always observe.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Find someone you love & trust, then you won't have to worry about that. No, that is not a concern of mine & for as long as I'm with my soon to be husband (father to my son & soon to be daughter), I will never have that worry. <br>  <br>  I have to admit, this is a sick question !!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	What the heck? NO!! If I worried about that, he wouldn't be my husband!!<br>  <br>  Are you actually *with* someone you have concerns about, or you just have that concern, in general? Cause, if you're with someone you think if a pedophile, DUMP him!|`|64OsCr8laa	honestly before i got married yes this was a huge concern for me as it happened to me it started when i was seven so yes this was a huge concern but now im married to a wonderful man and i have no fear of this happening because it is something we talk about and i completely trust him|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No, I would never be with a man who would do that.
4bzZNCYBaa	You pronounce it LOOH-kuh|`|zXcaTKqRaa	Luke-uh. I asked the same question not too long ago, aha.

The 'c' is hard, not soft.|`|jnSTr31gaa	Its pronounced Looo Ca|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Could be L-oo-s-uh or L-oo-c-uh<br>  <br>  Im not sure|`|tTKXq4Ohaa	Loo Cuh|`|flqAr30laa	Looooo Ka<br>  its cute.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	LOO-kah<br>  <br>  Meaning: Its source is Loukas, a Greek name meaning "One from Lucania." <br>  <br>  Languages: This boy's name is used in Italian. <br>  <br>  Popularity: The name Luca ranked 543rd in popularity for males of all ages in a sample of 2000-2003 Social Security Administration statistics. <br>  <br>  <br>  Narrative: Just as Germany is the English name for the country known to its own people as Deutschland, the ancient Greeks had names for various regions of the world, including those inhabited by non-Greeks. Lucania was their name for the region of Italy now known as Basilicata. Loukas was a name given to individuals from that area.<br>  <br>  Over time Loukas developed into a number of forms commonly used throughout the ancient world. (In ancient times, Greek was the language of business, much as English is today.) They were used without respect to the home country of the person so called.<br>  <br>  Continued use of this name (in various forms) can be attributed to the author of the third gospel in the Christian scriptures. Depending on the translation of the Bible, he is known as Luke, Lucas or Lucius.
G2auAv1Saa	From the other questions, I would say it will take 21 days from the day they sent it. <br>  I don't know anyone who has gotten a check from FEMA after Ike, they are still busy shoveling food into mouths in New Orleans. <br>  <br>  After Rita I know people who received checks and they were direct deposited- is this an option?  <br>  <br>  My county still hasn't been reimbursed from FEMA for the cleanup from Rita (3 and 5 months years ago). Please get renters insurance and don't rely on FEMA, renters insurance is very cheap and very well worth it. <br>  New hurricane season starts in about 3 months--- please please prepare yourself. Go ahead and register with 211.
5sfxUdlAaa	I had this problem too once, but with a guy who added me on Facebook. The name sounded kind of familiar so I added him on a limited profile. I blocked him after he kept offering to buy me a thong and constantly would ask where I lived because he lived within about ten miles from where I live. I didn't tell him and deleted him immediately.|`|wE3ubrhjaa	OMG. DELETE HIM IMMADIATLY!|`|e999e7de922e3571d326c032bb6fda4aaa	give your friends the heads up and delete him. or just say idk he started creepin me out.|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	something is attracting you to this...if not sure then dont do it.. if u add fuel to fire it will burn..ur chose|`|wdnbwViFaa	delete him ASAP|`|0unqJPehaa	Just stop talking to him and find new people to play the game with, he is a disgusting creep.
IFDfpbFJaa	I would start taking them now yes. I take prenatals and I also take Omega-3. My doctor wouldn't see me until I was at least 10 weeks.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	mine was 7 and 9 weeks <br>  take them today and keep going :)|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	My doctor had me wait until I was 10 weeks to have my first appointment, but I bought some vitamins and started taking them the same day I found out I was gonna be a mommy. I mean what could it really hurt? They are good for you anyway and your baby and body will thank you.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yes, it is recommended to start taking the vitamins when you start trying to conceive..So you should definitely start now that you are already pregnant!|`|JreuGwJYaa	you should schedule your apt now because they may not be able to get you in right away. They will write you a perscription for vitamins then.
TMhVClBgaa	go to a doctor. see if you really are pregnant, the test is not always accurate. and try a more common pain reliever for your back pain, one that can be recommended|`|K2jT1z5jaa	call and speak to your doctor if to continue the pills or not.<br>  he will advise you if to switch to different pills if needed.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|1hciyvKdaa	You must notify your Dr, some drugs are really known to cause issues, some mostly during the first trimester, it depends on each drug. You may find you will not be able to get pregnant if taking certain meds and it would be suggested you terminate, you never know, the Dr will investigate and let you know, you make sure they tell you, if they are super pro life, they may not say much, and you may be pro choice with known info. So find out, and from now on stay on birth control or abstinance, when you have children, you do want healthy children right? No reason to get pregnant during times that pregnancy is not recommended, to ensure quality of life for the baby. good luck on this hun.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I would definitely call your doc for this one. Side Note: not knowing the history of your back pain it is hard to make a suggestion however i suffer from injury from a car accident several years ago and luckily found a chiropractor that saved me the pain of surgery and having to take pain killers all the time. I am virtually pain free with weekly adjustments and daily core strengthening exercises. Something to think about??? I am 17 weeks pregnant and chiropractic care is defiantly safe for baby just make sure they have experience with pregnancy.|`|AEALOVUoaa	Not to undermind you, but have you called a doctor??? Any nurse on call will give you the answer to that.  Most likely they may need to switch your pain meds to something that won't harm your baby.  If there aren't a lot of tests on the meds, it may or may not harm your baby, so the best option is to remove the medication.|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Just call the doctor and ask.  My doctor prescribed things far worse and nothing is wrong with my baby.  They usually know which ones based on experience are safe.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Tell your doctor about the medication you've been taking, see what he/she suggests. Good luck!|`|Fp86T7yjaa	You have to call your doctor immediately! Prescription pain killers can be very harmful, especially early in the pregnancy.|`|OddqvjZnaa	you should of go and get testing. But i think you killed the BABY already what is the hell wrong with you taking the strong pills|`|0YdWJVyAaa	ask your doctor about it there could be a substitute for this medicine that is safe to use during pregnancy
vpWYS7cbaa	I got many bad grades in middle school and high school, but I didn't worry. Just do your best, and don't worry about your grades and what your parents say. Everyone gets bad grades.

But, if I had to chose one, Jacob is better, imo. It at least has some class to it. Jake is a nice nickname that he could even go by if he wanted to. Jayden is SO overused and trendy, as are the other Aiden, Brayden, Caiden, Hayden, etc. are as well. It will be very, very dated when he is an adult. <br>  <br>  So, some middle names for JACOB are--<br>  Jacob Lucas.<br>  Jacob Mark.<br>  Jacob Andrew.<br>  Jacob Nathaniel.<br>  Jacob Thomas.<br>  Jacob Everett. <br>  Jacob Matthew.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I agree with Blue Fox.

vOFdHvlvaa	U can't really get him to hold it, if he wants to try to hold it then just let him try, and he may eventually catch on, but some babies never wanna hold there own bottle, they'd rather u hold it for them lol, i babysit twins who at 15 months (mom got rid of bottles at this age) still didn't hold there own bottles, even though they were completely capable of it, lol.  And since he doesn't have it alot he can't really get used to it, so he may never hold the bottle.  My younger sis taught my son to hold it just by showin him how to and then lettin him try and he got it after a lil bit (he was young when he did it, only like 4/1/2 months or so).<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I don't know why you are expecting your 7 month old to feed himself.  My son is 9 months and he doesn't either.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	He'll do it when he's ready to, maybe he *likes* having you hold it for him?  I'm more than happy to hold the bottle for as long as he wants, it's cuddle-time I don't get to have any other time, they're so fidgety.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	If he's trying to wean himself to a sippy, just give him all his drinks out of it. If that's what he's happy drinking out of...Other than that, you can't really MAKE him hold the bottle, that's just kind of something they learn in their own time. Maybe he's just used to mommy holding him while he eats out of a bottle, and he wants that cuddle time.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	My LO was able to hold it around 5-6 months by herself, but didn't want to , which was find with me. I loved holding her and feeding her. <br>  <br>  She started to hold it and not want me to hold it at all around 10 months, I would still hold her while she drank her bottle, but she wanted to do it herself.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	Maybe he's not old enough to hold it himself yet. You'll need to keep doing it for him, if it is not too much trouble for you...|`|FPaZ5mWCaa	If he is not so interested in his bottle i would introduce a sippy cup for his milk, the transition can be hard so embrace this opportunity.<br>  <br>  x
4e67Pdfvaa	go to the hospital, I believe you are in labor... if your whole pelvic area hurts soo bad that you can't walk or talk druing them, its real labor contractions. COngrats!|`|AA11906603	Even when I was in labor, I could still walk just fine. I also had no problem sitting and moving my legs. My pelvic area seemed to be expanding during the last few days and it did feel like pressure. I felt like I was cracking apart. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are in labor, but experiencing some stress beyond that. The baby might be in a weird position. Please go get checked out tonight, for your sake and your baby's. If your doctor is not at the hospital, another one will be on call. You will feel a bit better if you know everything is OK or if you know they are going to help you in some way.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Call your doctor and ask his advice.|`|5YKkrPZ8aa	go to the emergency room and get the heck off of here. <br>  <br>  are you an idiot?|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	umm honey go to the ER|`|Q9Dwu9Eqaa	dude wtf get to the frickin ER!! why would u turn to yahoo answers???<br>  <br>  if u even THINK ur in labor u should be at the hospital!!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	DArling. call the E.R. or labour & delivry that you have the number to. So they can speak to you on what to do.<br>  <br>  If you walk and the pain continues. Definitely go to the hospital this does sound like its starting to be active labour. <br>  I was 4 cm - 5 cm & i could still walk. At about 8-9 cm I started to not be able to walk darling.<br>  <br>  If they dont ware off when you walk. Then definitely they are real contractions. is really good that they arent regular. as it will give you time to get ready and go to the hospital but let them now in advance that you are coming. so they can prepare a room etc for you<br>  <br>  God bless x  think you are

Low and behold she was pregnant and reaching the 5 month mark.|`|7QRq8b4baa	Take a test honey. There's no way to tell without it.

jnSTr31gaa	I used a method with my daughter and son that really worked. rather than just leaving them( they may feel insecure) you go in the room at timed intervals. leave her 1 minute then 2,5,10 etc gradually increasing the amount of minutes in between. don't speak to her too much. just go in lay her down and say sleep now or something along those lines. its pretty hard going,tiring and emotional doing this but it worked twice for me. so long as you are patient and keep it up. it worked on both of mine within a week|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	Talk to her pediatrician.  You need to stick with a method for a while for it to work, though.  Try this method for a week and look for any change in her behavior. If she's improving at all, keep doing it.  It's tough, but she's learned to rely on you, not herself, to fall asleep.  She needs to learn to self-soothe.|`|ghVa2DHmaa	As long as shes ok and you can tell shes just crying to cry, I would just let her cry it out. I had to do that with my son because I was so exhausted! And one night he cried for about 20 min and laid back down. Your not a bad parent for doing it. But if you dont think thats the best thing for your daughter, dont do it. Maybe get in a good routine or try a lovey. My son knows as soon as he has his lovey (silky little blanket) hes out!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Do you know her signals for being tired and ready to sleep?  Does she rub her eyes or ears, yawning is an obvious one, does she get restless?<br>  <br>  I find with my son that if he gets overtired he then gets crabby and fights sleep.  Whereas if I catch him at the right time he'll go out like a light.|`|A2Zo7eZWaa	honestly maybe shes not tired or shes past the point of exerstion... the cry it out method is perfectly fine and its the best solution
q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?<br>  Gomco Clamp- <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Plastibell- <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell...." rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a>|`|3xMQW0A6aa	the other two answerers are correct. it greatly decreases your chance for infection to be circumsized. <br>  also, if he wants to do it when he is older it will be very painful and he will remember it. he might have some resentment towards you for making him wait. as a baby, it is still painful but not as bad and they dont remember it.  <br>  i hope this helps you.|`|GLJkGgloaa	My husband and I are Pregnant with our First and if he is a boy he WILL NOT get circumcised.<br>  First off Infection and highly unlikely if the penis is taken care of properly. It can still get an infection if it is circumcised..<br>  Also my Husband is NOT circumcised and NEVER has a problem with it. His mother even said that there was nothing ever wrong with him as a baby.<br>  My husband and I both have a satisfying sex life. My husband till this day is glad that his mother left him whole. We see NO reason what so ever to have our son go through something like that.<br>  <br>  Also if your son does not plan on becoming a Porn star, getting a Circumcised penis so he could "look Good" is dumb. My husband told me, he knew no different and that the thought that it was just how it was. I as the wife, never noticed in till he pointed it out. The penis has two jobs, To pee and to help with the making of a baby. That's it.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	well, first off the procedure is minor and not painful.  he will not even remember it the next day.  also, i think it's important for a boy to be similar to his father in that area.  honestly, if my husband wasn't circumcised, i wouldn't do it either, but since he is, i will if we have a son next.  i wouldn't want my son to think something was wrong with him because he doesn't look like his father.  also, there are medical debates on this issue.  boys that aren't circumcised are more at risk for infections and some cancers.  just google it.|`|otFCWMuUaa	its not a cosmetic surgery.. has nothin to do with the way it looks. it is a huge bacteria collector and something that once hes old enough to care for his own "goods" like ages 4-11 your still gonna have to help him to make sure he doesnt contract infections.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I would say listen to your husband because he probably knows a little bit more abot being male than you do & has some goods reasons as to why he wants your son circumsized. If I ever have a son I will have him circumsized!|`|AA10312653	your right that its not medically nessacary..but your baby boy wont rember it when he is older..if he is circumsized|`|1S5AbPueaa	My husband is circumcised and so are both of my boys.He is the one who is going to show them how to stand up and use the restroom and we wanted them to all look the same.Also my brother who is not circumcised got an infection and i still remember him crying when my mom had to force the skin back and clean it.Better a little tears now when he is not old enough to remember,than alot of tears at a later age when he will remember the pain.|`|CpJnhy1saa	The only concern I would have to leave him uncircumsized is cleanliness. This is not a problem when he is a baby as the mom cleans it very well, but when he gets to be 7 to 12 most boys do not put being clean on the top of their list of priorities. My husband and I did have our son circumsized. I was so curious I asked my son (now in his late 20's) if he's glad we did and he emphatically said "Yes!". I was also surpised when they brought him back to my room in the hospital after the procedure. He was not crying or anything and nursed just as well as before. The nurse said they do put on a topical to lessen the pain. I hope my point of view helps somewhat, being from "down the road" from where you are at.|`|WPI0Z47saa	They don't do it because it looks better, They do it because it is healthier and men get less infections. It really isn't a big deal when they are babies. I was upset when they took my son to have it done thinking he would be in terrible pain. He came back within 5 minutes (seriously) and he wasn't crying or anything. It healed pretty quickly and there were never any issues with it. If you leave it until they are older, they may wish it was done but will probably be very frightened. That is a scary thought to have someone cut you there. It would also be more painful as they get older. So I would suggest having it done for health reasons. It will be fine and the baby will be fine. They won't remember it so it is better to get it over with.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I looked in to this when i was pregnant with my son, it is acually in no way less harmful to have it done it is all the same except u got to clean it, & for sexual atrction..<br>   i would look this up..<br>  tell ur husband there are people in africa that circumcise ther girls by cutting out the cliterus & sewing her up & she cannot perfore sexual. & would he feel the same if he was a girl..intercorse & b4 u thumbs down me look it up bc its true<br>  <br>  i did not do it to my son & he had no problem out of it WITHOUT haveing to pull his skin back it was fine|`|hoX7hoINaa	I work as a Nursing Assistant and I will only say that not circumcising causes increased chances of infections and usually is the outcome, and not only once. Only because you need to take extra care of it by pulling foreskin back, cleaning REALLY well, drying, and then pulling foreskin back over. It can be a big hassle, especially once he's older. If he doesn't clean properly, there will be lots of risks for infections. I would reccommend just circumcising for that reason. But its your and your husbands choice to make.|`|gY3wh4psaa	I've heard that circumcision keeps it clean|`|AA11208683	well technically either way your making a decision for your son, in this case you don't want it done. but if your husband leave you just because you didn't get him circumcised than he probably isn't the best man. but circumcising babies isn't as bad as your making it out to be. it may hurt them yeah but they are too little to realize it plus it heals within 5 - 7 days if you take care of it well. if he does deside to do it when he is older it is going to hurt him WAY worse than being a baby and getting it done. he would actually have to get surgery done and go through a lot more healing... plus it would cost you a lot more. i know most men like having it gone because its less of a hassle for them. my husband thinks its gross too. but i think you two should talk it over. one of you might not like it, but remember its your son, and your making the decision for him no matter what.|`|Zh5SQ1GNaa	You just do the right thing....your husband WILL get used to it. My husband is circumcised, but I would never get my baby done. Why are dad's so worried about their sons penis looking like theirs....like sons and dad's compare penises as adults. PLEASE!! and as far as the cleanliness issue....how about mum's teach hygiene to their boys rather than just chop off part of their manhood.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I am thankful my husband agreed that it was unnecessary even though he himself is done. I'm not sure what's so gross about the way it looks, it looks fine to me. It's a very personal decision. You might see if you can find a video of how it's done for him to watch, also bring it up with the doctor to see if they can give some good reasons on why not to do it. Most doctors don't suggest having it done and don't even like preforming the procedure. If he needs more convincing have him talk to the doctor personally about it.<br>  <br>  Surely your doctor has had this come up before and will have some suggestions.<br>  <br>  If it decreased infection by that much most of the world would be crawling with penile infection, the majority of the world doesn't do it.  From the reading I have done you have to do over 6000 circumcisions to prevent 1 infection that's easily treated with antibiotics.<br>  <br>  You have it completely correct, the penis is self cleaning. Pulling the skin back is actually harmful in the same way douching is for women.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	I look at it this way.  If it wasn't supposed to be there, little boys wouldn't be born with it there in the first place.  My husband is uncircumcised and he has never had a problem with infection, takes care of that area very well, we have a very satisfying sex life and it was never once questioned "by other boys in the gym change room at school".  I have had partners who are both circumcised and uncircumcised and it makes absolutely no difference during sex.  The foreskin is there to stop infection, keep the area clean and moist and stop it from drying out, prevent chaffing on the underwear and clothing ans makes the penis much more sensitive and responsive during sex.  I am having a little boy in the near future and I left the circumcision decision to my husband.  He has decided that we will not have it done.  Realistically, it is genital mutilation.  It should be a prohibited practice just the same as for genital mutilation of girls.

However, depending on your area, tap water may not be safe for infants.<br>  Once water reaches 100o it begins sterilizing, and for a medium sized pot, will take 1/2 to 1 minute to completely sterilize.  <br>  Also, once the water is boiled, letting it sit and cool without being in a closed container, will immediately start collecting bacteria.  <br>  (Technically, storing the water in an unsterilized container also contaminates the water, but the amount of bacteria collected is minuscule so long as the container is closed and stored in a fridge)<br>  <br>  So, in summary, for sterilized water:<br>  1. Boil water, once is completely boiling, keep heated or 30-60 seconds<br>  2. Store in a closed container in the fridge if not using immediately<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,of course not. If you like soccer,then it's not a waste of time. I played volleyball in middle school,and believe me when I tell you,I sucked so bad when I first started. But I practiced that summer,and came back the next season,I actually got a compliment from my coach,she noticed I had been trying to get better. So,for just one person to notice,it was worth it.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Anything you do that makes you happy is not a waste of time.  Its good to have dreams.  Go for it.  And if your dreams dont come true, at least you tried and you had a hell of a lot of fun practicing your soccer everyday.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  (Oh, and gals just cause trouble.  Do what makes you happy.  Live life for YOU and dont let anyone elses opinions get in your way.  Good luck!  i hope you make it big!)|`|tfdQxfrpaa	You are the only one that can answer that question. Will you be disappointed if you end up not doing something with this when you have spent a great deal of your time on it, or will you think that you were doing what you thought was best and responsible? Personally, I think you're being very mature training so much. You see something you want and you are going after it. Keep up your hard work, It will pay off and good luck!
0nIwKd5Uaa	The first Ultra sound they could have mistaken the cord for a penis.  <br>  <br>  I would be prepared for both genders to be on the safe side.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	It depends on the view they were able to get each time and which view was a better angle. It also depends if they were 2d or 3d ultrasound. You won't know for sure until you deliver, so I would have a name for both genders in mind.|`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	The most recent ultrasound would most likely be more accurate<br>  God bless.|`|E047GSKdaa	Look at it this way, it is either a girl, or a very unlucky boy.|`|LdKQU7QYaa	You have the IQ of a four year old.|`|cVtHEVRnaa	My brain is now a pretzel.
90zcKChJaa	Have lots of sex. Sperm sends chemicals to relax the cervix late in pregnancy! Also you can stimulate your nipples, yes, walking does help too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uuHPneEcaa	walking helps and sex helps too.. but y dont u just let it happen naturally? Contractions help u dilate alot. <br>  <br>  I am sure ur probably tired of waiting and so am i but let ur baby come when he/she is good and ready! =)  Im sure it will be soon|`|kT7GVOosaa	walking is always good for that however it can be painful on your feet. I would walk around a place where you have many opportunities to sit down and rest.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	YES ALL THAT HELPS , BUT SEX IS GREAT THERE IS SOMTHING IN THE MANS SEMEN  THAT HELPS SOFTEN THE CERVIX - PROVEN FACT <br>  <br>  FOUND THIS - HERE YA GO <br>  <br>  1. Eat spicy foods or pineapple. <br>  <br>  2. Go for a walk or march up some stairs. This is thought to bring on labor because of the pressure of the baby?s head pressing down on your cervix. At the very least, walking can help get your baby into a better position for labor. <br>  <br>  3. Have sex. A favorite for many pregnant women, sex can help by releasing a hormone called oxytocin, which causes the uterus to contract. Additionally, semen contains a substance known as prostaglandins, which will help soften the cervix. <br>  <br>  4. Nipple stimulation. For those who find sex just too uncomfortable right now, nipple stimulation may be a better choice. It helps to bring on labor in much the same way sex does, by releasing oxytocin. However, this method may take a bit more effort than sex to start labor. <br>  <br>  5. Stretching of the uterine opening membranes. This can be done by your doctor or midwife and has been found to increase the chances of labor starting within 48 hours. <br>  <br>  6. Complementary therapies. Acupuncture, massage, teas, herbs and homeopathic remedies can be helpful when it comes to inducing labor. However, make sure you go to a licensed practitioner who has experience treating pregnant women. <br>  <br>  One home remedy that is often recommended to pregnant women is castor oil taken either alone or with orange juice. While some women swear by this method, many experts and women who have tried it will strongly advise you against it. Castor oil may or may not bring on labor but it will definitely make you nauseous, cause you to vomit, have diarrhea and suffer severe cramps so just steer clear of this home remedy.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Those things help with bringing the baby down so that the baby can put pressure on the cervix to cause dilation.  The only other thing that I know that can soften the cervix is sex because sperm has prostaglandins in it.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	i know walking can help, but my doctor told me to have LOTS and LOTS of sex.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	sex....semen has something called progragstilins in it and they are similar to something in cervadil which they use to soften your cervix.<br>  How close are you to term?|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	yes lots of walking, and have sex. that should help move things along
pNKBszseaa	miscarriage is when a baby isn't viable out side of the womb. A still born baby is one that is born developed, possible to live out side the womb but born deceased.|`|vue9NOhYaa	The difference is when it happens.  A miscarriage is early (IIRC, anything before 20 weeks is considered a miscarriage. Anything after 20 weeks would be a still birth.)|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Still born is born dead. The child may be strangled by the umbilical cord, it may die of something before labor starts, something else during labor may kill it. The mom delivers a still little corpse and has a sad spot in her heart for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  A miscarriage is when the fetus dies sometime before labor starts. Sometimes it comes out on its own, sometimes the doctor has to do what they call a D&C.<br>  <br>  The dictionary I use says<br>  <br>  Miscarriage: The premature expulsion of a nonviable fetus from the uterus. Also called spontaneous abortion. <br>  <br>  Stillbirth: <br>  1. The birth of a dead child or fetus. <br>  2. A child or fetus dead at birth.<br>  <br>  The distinction seems to be whether the child could have lived if it had come out alive.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	A stillbirth occurs when a fetus which has died in the uterus or during labor or delivery exits a woman's body. The term is often used in distinction to live birth or miscarriage. Most stillbirths occur in full term pregnancies.<br>  <br>  a miscarriage is the natural expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the womb before it is sufficiently developed to survive|`|g9ZFjl6paa	I had to do a interview with a women who was pregnant with twins and lost the one right as she went into labor.

Stillbirth often occurs unexpectedly and can take place in both healthy pregnancies and in those pregnancies complicated by other health issues|`|9QVjNaIPaa	a miscarriage is when you loose the baby before it fully forms and your body 'disposes' of it like your period. a still born is when you actually give birth to a fully formed baby but it is dead.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I'm not sure about the exact week, but I think if it's before 23 weeks it's classified as a misscariage, if it's after that time, it's a stillborn.

0YdWJVyAaa	i just wanna make sure that i got this right , so your wife had a miscarriage on jan 11 , and she tested today and got positive results , right?? well then congrats she is actually pregnant .. and i can confidently say that from my experience as i had a miscarriage last year , and the very next month i got pregnant again, and gave birth to a beautiful girl 9 months later , my doc told me that the levels of HGC drop to  nothing within 2 weeks after a miscarriage , so her body should have already been clear of it from the previous pregnancy by now.|`|AA10473413	Hey Seth,<br>  <br>  This could absolutely be a false positive from the last pregnancy.  HGC can stay in your system for a while, and the longer she was pregnant the more HGC she'd have had in her body at the time of the miscarriage.  At-home pregnancy tests are designed to work off the HGC levels present only a couple weeks after conception, so it is definitely possible.<br>  <br>  However, one other thing to keep in mind is her menstrual cycle.  High residual hormone levels generally impact the body's ability to menstruate for a while afterwards.  If she has not had at least one period since her miscarriage, it is unlikely that she is actually pregnant as this signals the restarting of ovulation.  If she has had at least one, however, you are probably getting a true positive.<br>  <br>  However, as you said, you won't know for sure until you talk to a doctor.  Good luck to you and your wife!<br>  <br>  Katie|`|diT2WFfCaa	It really depends on how far along her pregnancy was the first time.  The longer she was pregnant, the more HGC there would be in her system, and the longer it would take for it to leave.<br>  <br>  If she has already started her period again, then chances are most of the HGC has gone, and this could be a new pregnancy.  But see your doctor.|`|QAptQNMOaa	Yes i still had HCG levels in my system 8 wks after and i was 9 wks pregnant.|`|KXArFfGFaa	One of my miscarriages that I had I had went to the bathroom and passed a huge clot with noticeable cartilage, in the morning I was scheduled for a D&C. I had the HGC testing and a pregnancy test shortly after the miscarriage and I was still pregnant. What happened then is they gave me a ultrasound and they couldn't find anything. I was given a vaginal ultrasound and they found a dead fetus that measured out at 10 weeks in the opening of the fallopian tube and in the corner of the uterus. <br>  Maybe your wife is still pregnant? She could of miscarried one fetus, but maybe there is one still in there somewhere. Good Luck with your findings.|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Hi Seth, I'm sorry about your loss.  I've miscarried 2ce and have never needed an D & C.  Both times I was within the 1st couple months of pregnancy.  It usually takes the body a few months to get back on a regular cycle, in which you can try again.  I have a feeling that this is just left over hormones from the miscarriage.  It's ok to ask on here, sometimes knowing what's possibly going on helps keep the sanity while you wait for your appointment.  Good Luck.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	As I said before it could be either, but she should be cleared by now - if she is not she needs a D&C.   At the appointment she will have a vaginal ultrasound to see what is in her uterus.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i miscarried last april at 10 weeks pregnant, i got faint positives on a home pregnancy test for 21 weeks!!! it was left over hormones, the doctor told me they can only stay in the system for up to 3 weeks, i must just of been an off case :P<br>  <br>  <br>  if the lines on the test are dark, then i should think its a new pregnancy, a doctor will preform to blood tests 72 hours apart to ensure the HCG is doubleing
vue9NOhYaa	Follow your baby's lead.  All purees are basically the same -- stage 2 is just stage one in bigger jars, and with a few more ingredients. <br>  <br>  So, if she's regularly polishing off the stage one jars, feel free to move on. <br>  <br>  Finger foods? Again, when she's ready.  7-9 months is the usual range, but she may be ready a bit sooner, or a bit later. <br>  <br>  She doesn't 'need' any cereal at all. It's just starch with a little iron added, and her formula provides all the iron she needs.  If she likes it, and it doesn't constipate her, she can have it.  Otherwise, offer more interesting foods. <br>  <br>  3 meals a day of solids IS quite a lot for a 6 month old.  She can certainly have more formula (30 ounces is pretty low for such a big girl), so I'd probably offer a bit more formula and maybe ease off on the solids.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL.. oh goodness. I was reading the top part and thinking to myself "Are you serious???" I was ready to give you a piece of my mind! :P<br>  <br>  Anyway, the guidelines on foods are just those. You feed your baby what you think she is ready for and capable of eating. There isn't much difference between stage 1 foods and stage 2 foods aside from the size. I'd switch to stage 2 once your daughter is completely two of the stage 1 foods at a time.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry so much about when and how much you're feeding her. Solids, at this age, are just for practice and fun. It sounds like you're feeding her PLENTY as far as solids go so I wouldn't offer any more. Go by her cues. If she seems hungrier at this age offer more formula.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	It doesn't matter how big she is...she needs to practise chewing. My son found stage two food too lumpy, so I ended up chopping rice finely and mixing it with stage one food so he got accustomed to the texture before switching over. best way is to make your own and gradually increase size of lumps. and it's healthier...and babies like it more! in the UK, stage 2 is from 7 months.|`|u94HOVz7aa	lol i just had to say thanks for the laugh.  i don't have any advice, but wanted to say i loved how you worded your question.  my baby is only 2 months old and his sisters are 4 and 6 and cant remember what, when and how much fed them at that age.  and i know things have changed since then.
drI1vsJdaa	Ground them longer. Take everything out of their rooms except their beds, and some clothes. Make them earn back the other stuff. If they ignore you again, take it all back and make them earn it again.
nmu6coapaa	Ok, call your hospital or doctor and they will advise you on what best to do judging on how your daughter is acting! Dont worry too much, kids this do this a lot and you wouldn't have had anything laying around that would have done her any harm! Good luck and let us know!|`|uLeg1Aniaa	How is she acting?  Does she seem to have a hard time breathing?  If not and she doesn't seem to be acting out of the ordinary then I think you should be fine.  I would just watch her closely for the rest of the day and if anything out of the ordinary happens then you may want to take action, like take her to the hospital.  If she swallowed it without any problem then its problem really small and probably won't hurt her.  Relax and just keep a close eye on her for a while.|`|ll5xkkwnaa	Umm, Call your pediatrician immediately!! You never know what she may have swallowed may harm her!!|`|723QHuicaa	A&E now.<br>  <br>  They will x-ray and advise you on what to do, however my concern would be if it was a sort of medication - I really hope there is no chance of that.<br>  <br>  Most likely they will hand you rubber gloves, tell you to rummage in her poo, if she doesnt pass whatever it was in 3 days, to return. Thats what they told me when my daughter swallowed a metal hairclip. She passed it the next day with no trouble.
Vv6Dg6Q0aa	When your girlfriend is in labour, tie a string around your nuts.<br>  <br>  Get her to give it a good tug every time she gets a contraction.<br>  <br>  That'll give you a nice idea of what it feels like.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	It's honestly not as bad as most people make it out to be. At least it wasn't for me. I was in labor at home for 12 hours before I even went to the hospital, and even then, I could still walk and talk and eat, and function just fine. As things progressed, the contractions got a little stronger, but it was still bearable, it just felt better to get up and walk around. After about 15 hours of labor, I got an epidural, and then everything felt wonderful! You could have run me over with a car LOL! After that, the actual pushing just becomes tiring, frustrating, and irritating more than anything else. I think your gf will be just fine! Congrats to you both! You'll love every minute of being parents, no matter how hard it seems!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	well since guys say getting kicked in your man hood hurts oh so bad just imagine that pain nonstop for several hours!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	well imagine trying to squirt a watermelon out ur anus & thats about how bad it would hurt|`|SdVrwd6daa	imagine pushing something out of her. she will only dialate 10cm and the baby is probably going to be about 7 or 8 lbs coming out. when the baby comes out her vagina will rip open. i can only imagine how much that hurts. i just had my daughter 1 month ago. i went 8 hrs with no epidural and my contractions were horribly painful. after the epidural i didn't feel a thing. and the reason ppl are having more than one kid is bc once you hold her in ur arms thos 9 months and however many hours are all worth w/e pain u had to endure. and afterwards u wont even remember what it feels like.|`|9AzIpwx1aa	The LAW says that you MUST pay for the child/baby, until its 18 years of age.,|`|AA11877042	well every ones pregnancy is different, some people don't feel anything at all|`|1tmX7xbRaa	ok think of it this way .... think of somebody ripping off your pecker with no medication and multiply that by about a million. that's about how much pain women go through. of course it's not THAT horrible if they get an epidural but even after that it's still pretty painful. im having another kid despite the pain i went through but i don't have to do it this time because i had an emergency section the first time so they are scheduling me one for the second one (due in may) so i don't have to go through the same pain as before. and even AFTER the labor and birth there is still MUCH discomfort!|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	Well depending on if its a c-section or vaginal and wherether she does it naturally or medicated. That makes all the difference.<br>  <br>  I just had my baby girl delivered Monday morning at 3:42 A.M. She was 3 months early but other then that she's fine. I didn't get no choice in how she was birthed. They said a c-section and the option of being under anesthesia or epidural/spinal block during the c-section. If I chose anesthesia, no one could have been in the room with me. So I chose the epidural/spinal block so I could have 1 person with me. I didn't feel any pain during the procedure, although I was in and out of consciousness.  I do remember feeling tugging and pulling but with no pain. Afterwards though I did feel a bit of pain after the pain killers wore off but they gave me more. But during the actual procedure no.<br>  <br>  If I had a choice I would have wanted to give birth vaginally but it was out of my hands. If they hadn't done what they had done, I could be dead or my baby because it was that bad.<br>  <br>  So I don't regret that I had to have a c-section, I have a beautiful little girl. She's still in the hospital because she's so young but she's doing great.<br>  <br>  This is my first baby so I don't have any other delivery experiences. I know for each woman its different. What may cause one woman pain might not cause the same level of pain for another.
FHT6wsUpaa	Wal-Mart Faded Glory bobby socks...the ones that fold over the ankle. Those are the ONLY ones that stayed on my daughter, and we're still using them!!<br>  <br>  You can buy them in packs of 10, and in boy or girl colors or just plain white. They're super stretchy and fit snugly.<br>  <br>   Good luck!|`|u94HOVz7aa	i found tights work better than socks.  yes even for my son.  i just use neutral colors mostly white.|`|jBnQiZVFaa	I think it has something to do with the shape of the foot.  I have an awful time getting socks to stay on my nine-month old son.  Even before he was moving around.  I find the thicker Old Navy style works well.  The ones with kinda strange designs that are shorter (no cuff) and thick like sweat material.  The regular Old Navy cuff ones don't, but the weird ones do. I just try to match them to his outfit, but call him hippy-stylish if I can't!  Rather him have warm feet.|`|p2gMf7JIaa	i really like the socks you can get at Target. They sell them separately which sucks, but they are awesome. The 0-6 month ones look HUGE but they are great because you can fold them over a couple times and they stay on nice and snug. I wish i had put my lil guy in them sooner, everything else kept falling off so i assumed those would too. But i was wrong!|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I like Carters socks.  They come in a 6 pack at Babies R Us.  They say Cutie and they have dogs and baseballs (boy, of course)  I like Gap too.  But NOT OSHKOSH!!!!<br>  <br>  But have you bought Robeez?  They are shoes, and kind of xpensive, like $35, but they are the BEST BEST BEST.  You can google Robeez but they sell them at Lord & Taylor and I think Bed BAth and Beyond and Diapers.com.  They stay on and so the socks stay on.  Good Luck!

FA1rRzUxaa	Im not sure to be honest. I was sent this link off someone on here when i asked a question about the cervix. It is a bit graphic, but i found it helpful. Let me know what you think of it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautifulcervix.com/photos-of-cervix/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautifulcervix.com/photos-of...</a><br>  <br>  I got my BFP on Saturday and my cervix feels slightly open. In early pregnancy your cervix is supposed to be S.H.O.W soft, high, open and wet. So if it is slightly open it doesn't mean your defiantly not pregnant.

8pl3ShtBaa	Though your chances of becoming pregnant are subtantially lowered because you had just gotten off your period and probably are not ovulating that early in your cycle, but anything can happen.<br>  <br>  You can take an early response test up to 5 days before your missed period and I would reccommend the morning as is has your highest hormone ratings.<br>  <br>  There are no symptoms that every person gets, the first thing you may get is implantation bleeding which would be a pinkish brown discharge about 7-10 days after implantation if it happens. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|diT2WFfCaa	The chances of getting pregnant are significantly lower since you are not in the middle of your cycle-however, since every woman's cycle is different, and some sperm can live up to a week, there is a possibility.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, for you to be sure of getting accurate results from an at-home test, you should wait for at least 14 days OR your missed period to test.  Even with the more sensitive ones, the accuracy substantially decreases every day before your period that you test.<br>  <br>  If you are really worried, call your doctor and find out how soon they can do a blood test, which are more accurate earlier than the at home tests.|`|4104d17ef245fd7c2d8cd4a6b76b05b2aa	Most women ovulate at least a week after their period.

Ka52nbhNaa	I have 6 month old twins from IVF.  During my pregnancy, I saw a high-risk OB from the Fetal Maternal Unit at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston.  She was fabulous.<br>  <br>  We were hoping to go with a vaginal birth, but due to complications with one of the twins, we delivered them via scheduled c-section at 37 weeks.  During the pregnancy, she told me that she always gives her multiple birth patients the "option" of a c-section and whenever possible prefers to schedule it at 37 weeks or later for twins as this is considered term for twins . . . .in certain situations, it can be necessary to do it earlier . . . but the longer you can keep them in the better.<br>  <br>  I had my twins at 37 weeks on the dot.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|PQw92IGHaa	It all depends on how you and your babies are doing.  Typically they look at both of your twins and make sure that they are about the same size, If one starts getting bigger than the other (they base this by percentage...meaning one being 5 to 10% bigger than the other)  they will recommend inducing you earlier.  All doctors are different.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	Sorry I can't answer b/c I lost my twins at 21 weeks but I feel compelled to respond to Amber:  twins ARE high-risk.. if they weren't then mine would be with me now instead of dead and buried.

AaxIZSTwaa	You can be pregnant and still bleed, especially in the beginning. If AF was much shorter than normal and lighter, than I would take a test just to be sure, because you still could be. In the beginning of pregnancy women often have cramps also, so if you are having cramps after AF is completely gone, that could definitely be a sign also.  Good luck!

WBw9lDG8aa	hey girl i know it is when TTC we having to be playing guessing game's with are AF and it sucks well my best advice to you is if u are trying to get pregnant go to ur doc.... and tell him u have irregular period b-cuz to tell u the truth i dont think ur going to get pregnant any time soon b-cuz i have that very same problem I also have irregular period so my doc... proscribed me <br>  <br>  1. metformin 500 mg x 2 a day (to double my chance"s)<br>  2.provera 10 mg for 10 day's (induce my period)<br>  3.clomid 50 mg CD 5-9 (to make me ovulate)<br>  <br>  I already started metformin and provera im just waiting for my period to start then start taking clomid CD 5-9. but the reasearches i've done clomid usally works in 1-3 cycel's but it can take up to 6 months and ppl with regualr periods have 12 chances to get pregnant out of 12 months in a yr meaning u have a 25% chance every month to concieve a child and ppl with irregular period's have 6 chances out of the yr to have a child.<br>  <br>  and it suck's that ppl like us we have to be playing guessing game's with are af u know what i mean and there for we have to getting on all this kind's of med's to become pg's but it's ok b-cuz it well worth it well girl i hope i helped baby dust to you.<br>  <br>  here are some websites if u wanna check them out<br>  <br>  want 2 know everything in general about (baby/pregnancy)?<br>  <a href="http://babycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://babycenter.com</a><br>  <br>  wanna know when ur ovulating?<br>  <a href="http://mymonthlycycle.com" rel="nofollow">http://mymonthlycycle.com</a><br>  <br>  want good deal's on (opk/hpt) test?<br>  <a href="http://early-pregnancy-test.com" rel="nofollow">http://early-pregnancy-test.com</a><br>  <br>  frequent asked question's about clomid<br>  <a href="http://tryingtoconceive.com/clomid.h..." rel="nofollow">http://tryingtoconceive.com/clomid.h...</a><br>  <br>  clomid ovulation calender?<br>  <a href="http://babymeds.com" rel="nofollow">http://babymeds.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  TIPS ON WHAT U NEED TO GET STARTED TO GETTING PGS<br>  1. get a calender<br>  2. buy opk test's<br>  3. moniter ur temp... in da morning.<br>  4. take clomid<br>  5. have sex's every other day<br>  6. dont get up after sex's stay there for like 20-30 minuts<br>  7. last but not least take a HPT<br>  and hope for the best<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK BABY DUST TO EVERY ONE INCLUDING MY SELF...|`|90zcKChJaa	A pregnancy test will work by now. I would recommend testing your ovulation days with test strips.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|xwZKouCIaa	here's thr problem; since you dont mentrate regularly your probably not ovulating on a regular basis either.. so it would be virtualy impossible to track your most fertile days, so ur best bet would be to go to your doctor and explain to him/her that u are ttc and if there is anythign he she can give you to help your ovulation also might want to get your hormones checked to see y it is that you dont menstrate accordingly.. hope this info helps good luck to you and lots of baby dust for the both of us!|`|fG727pkuaa	If you only getting your period 2-4 times a year you should really consult a fertility doctor so that they can prescribe you medication that will make your ovulate. Also, to really know when you ovulate you should try a fertility monitor. It works like a charm!

AA11294818	Hm, you know what? You are pretty early in your pregnancy.. and I spotted here and there with brown looking blood up to the 8th week (and wouldn't be surprised if it happened more)... although I hadn't experienced enough for it to be lumpy. Then again, if it mixes with your normal discharge it may look lumpy especially if it is continuously building on your underwear to see it. If there is no blood that feels like a warning (lots or red) and no bad cramps then you're probably still having a settling in stage I would assume. Apparently there's some shifting and cozying in that goes on, as well as stretching etc.. spotting isn't that bad for the most part, please don't worry about it. The good thing now is that the doc will see you often so you'll know things are still going OK or not. If the pregnancy is meant to be, it WILL be :)<br>  <br>  Take care and God bless|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	It should stop soon. I had the same thing around 6 or 7 weeks. But, I am now 10 weeks and the brown blood has stopped. A little bit of cramping is okay, it's normal, the baby is growing. Wait til you get another ultra sound, you're going to be amazed. I was when I saw how much it grew. Don't worry though, it's normal.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	No I don't know what it is. Hopefully the doctors will come back with an answer for you soon!!!!!!! I hope everything will be alright.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I don't remember the med term for it but your cervix can become irritated and bleed a little bit and it dries up and turns to brown blood. If your cervix is closed it may just be a little irritated. As long as its not like bright red blood youll be fine!!!!  GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NwTggQ2Baa	Like others have said, it is just old blood. <br>  I have never had this experience but I do think that it is old blood that just needed to come out. Everything is okay!|`|eytlIKITaa	Brown is old blood, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  If it gets worse, like red blood then I would tell you to call your doctor.  Good luck and congrats!|`|XpQkQassaa	Well, sometimes the brownish color discharge is just from the fetus attaching to your uterus. However, my sister had some of the same symptoms you are having, except she was bleeding like a normal period. She had a sonogram and the baby had a heart beat and her cervix was closed but she still miscarried the baby. Honestly, it could be anything and I know that you are freaking out but there is nothing you can do to help. he best thing for you is to try and relax and drink alot of water.|`|oN9UNGZfaa	I'm 9 weeks started bleeding like that around 7 weeks and then again at 8 weeks I also have to go to the doc every 2 weeks from now on they think it may be a cyst or something like that maybe that's what you have I'm preying that everything is OK|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Sounds like old blood...your cervix becomes engorged with blood vessels in pregnancy so any manipulation of your cervix can cause spotting...<br>  If your ultrasound was ok and your hormone levels. I think your fine!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	If it is brown then it is just old blood.  I wouldn't worry unless it turned pink or red.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	its just old blood. its normal early in pregnancy around the time your period would normally be due.|`|paHbLR9aaa	Sounds like old blood to me.|`|o6M7Hh4naa	Yes i have had that same experience i was 7 weeks and had brown discharge and then at 8 weeks i started some bleeding so me and my husband decided to go to the hospital and they told us it was a threatened miscarriage due to a a trip i took from texas to chicago but the Dr told us everything was fine but i kept and stillhave perios like crampings but i am now 15 wks and they have done 3 sonograms and a vaginal and cervix exam and everything seems to be fine but te cramping wont go away.. every now and then i get some light discharge with blood but my OB told me it might be the uterus stretching and movements but that my baby is fine i still go to the Dr often just in case<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway Good Luck and i guess we have no other choice but to rely on our Dr<br>  <br>  Congrats on the baby and best of luck to YOU!!!!|`|xwZV9jgPaa	sometimes when you have sex when you are pregnant you can bleed a little. see your uterus lining sheds when the egg is released from the fallopian tubs...that's why you have your period, its your body's way of trying to get rid of a foreign object. when you are pregnant your uterus is sorta like on alert....the egg has attached and therefor your uterus' natural response would be to shed to get rid of it, since you are pregnant it wont do that. However, there is alot of blood flow to this part of your body still so when you have sex, sometimes your lining sheds a bit due to....well....friction. Not sure if that might be a reason but keep in mind.

The name Addison never even was heard of until about three years ago.  Or Ava.  They are both incredibly common now.  Ethan was a known name, but was not common at all until the past couple years.  I would wait until you are actually going to have a baby before deciding on their name.  I want to have a Sabrina and a Seth.  They are currently uncommon, but who knows.  My son is Ethan and my daughter is Julia.  Julia is not common for now and Ethan is the most popular for last year.

But i'm not for an abortion if the woman is raped, give the baby up for adoption if u don't think u could love and care for it, but not kill an innocent lil baby.   My younger sis was only 9 years old when she was raped and she ended up pregnant, and she was completely against abortion cuz she thought it was wrong to punish an innocent lil baby for somethin it had no control over at all.  She also kept the baby and her daughter is now 7 months old, and she is a wonderful mother, even if she is so young. <br>  But then again that's just my opinion and i know lots of people aren't gonna agree with me on this, but oh well.<br>  Yea teen girls who get pregnant cuz they aren't careful and then just get an abortion are really being selfish, that's why when i got pregnant at 15, i didn't get an abortion, and very glad i didn't, i have a beautiful, smart almost 9 month old son and i wouldn't trade him for anything.

It does get frustrating at times, but it's something that has to be done. Can you get a break from your baby? Maybe have someone sit for one day so you can get a break? If you really feel like you don't love your baby I think you should maybe see a doctor or counselor. Those aren't healthy feelings and may be associated PPD.

ebQJsYTxaa	Those are very common reactions, but not healthy.  Ask yourself why the nurse lied to you.  To manipulate you into allowing the vaccines?<br>  <br>  I suggest you thoroughly research vaccines before allowing your baby to get any more.  Vaccines are not mandatory.  Your child can go to school and daycare without them.  Here's the information on exemptions.<br>  <br>  United States: <a href="http://mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=953402" rel="nofollow">http://mothering.com/discussions/showthr...</a><br>  <br>  Canada: <a href="http://vran.org/legal/forms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vran.org/legal/forms.htm</a><br>  <br>  If you decide to continue with vaccinating, I strongly suggest you do not give Tylenol before or after.  Tylenol depletes glutathione from the body. Glutathione is needed to detoxify the body after vaccines. So if you give Tylenol, the vaccines will be more toxic to your baby.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	That is normal. Most babies are out of it for 24 hours after shots.

Try not to bump the spot his injection was and give alot of cuddles. He just wants to be close to mommy right now.<br>  <br>  I reassure you there is nothing wrong with him because the clinic would have told you there are mild side effects and they wait to see if the baby  vomits, if he hasn't vomited within 30 min after the injection then he is fine i promise..<br>  <br>  i always place my babies on my breast when they getting there injection's because they are close to me and after the injection they keep nursing until the pain soothes..<br>  <br>  good luck hun give your bubby a kiss for being so strong!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's normal. My baby didn't get too fussy, because we only gave her 1 shot at a time over the course of 4 weeks. But fussiness is completely normal. They should have given you a side effect sheet for each shot. If she got the DaTP shot, it's probably from that. Also check his temp, because it can make them run a slight fever. Common side effects are fever, fussiness, fatigue, redness at the injection site, ect. And if you get too worried, call the doc, even if it's after hours they should have a nurse that will call you back.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Ask your doctor if it's okay to give your child infants tylenol.  I would give my child some tylenol 20 minutes before he went to get his vaccinations and he's done just fine.  But make sure your doctor says it's okay first.  When they get their shots, they tend to sometimes be a bit more clingy, and want more attention too...and maybe eat more (especially if breastfeeding, since it's also a source of comfort for them.)  I hope your little one is feeling better soon!|`|Hk6wIgiOaa	Yes it is very normal. You should rub the spots gently where the shots were given.

Starting cereal or solids isn't recommended til at least 4 Months about 16 weeks)...so maybe just add extra oz or feed more often. Also you could call her pedi. They'll be able to give you the best advice for YOUR baby as every baby is different. Does she have a 4 month appt scheduled soon? Cause that's when a doctor normally recommends starting solids or waiting. Personally, I would stick out the formula only routine for a few more weeks til 4 months.<br>  <br>  Edit..and don't put rice cereal in a bottle. It's just a "filler" food and may cause choking in a bottle.|`|cc9fc3899a8d3e6ef401a41140938b97aa	WOW  7 oz is ALOT  for a baby that age. Considering that their stomach is the same size as their fist I cannot imagine where she is stuffing that much milk at a time!<br>  <br>  Does she spit up or vomit alot? IF so you could be over feeding her and then she cries mistaking her tummy pain for hunger and then eats more.<br>  And the cycle continues.<br>  Try decreasing her to about 5oz and add some rice cereal to it.<br>  <br>  Best to talk with her pediatrician about all of this though - ok .
diT2WFfCaa	YES!<br>  <br>  Here's how your cycle works:  The first day of your cycle is the first day of your period. About 14 days into your cycle (this is approximate...it varies from person to person) you release an egg into your fallopian tubes.  It has about 24 hours to meet a sperm before it starts traveling down to your uterus.  If it HAS met a sperm, it will then bury itself in the uterine wall and release hormones to stop your period.  If it HASN'T, then your cycle continues as normal, and the egg is flushed out with the uterine lining that sheds (causing the bleeding that is your period.)<br>  <br>  This is a little simplistic, but is basically how it works.  You are LESS likely to get pregnant during your period than other days.  Please take the time to talk to your doctor or do some research on the topic. It sounds like you need a much more detailed explanation of the topic than anyone can give you here.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	yes princess|`|kUCVLuTPaa	you must be young and obviously shouldnt be having sex if you don't know the answer to this question..yes!|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Definately.|`|CpJnhy1saa	Most women are most fertile about 14 days after the first day of their period. So yes!|`|52U22fiAaa	Of course.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	gosh i haved learn that parents dont tell there kids anything anymore so i will be sure to educate my child of these things<br>  & yes u can|`|avkZGv1taa	I think your logic is a little backwards... it is more likely for her to get pregnant between her periods (halfway between to be more precise).  Im not 100% sure what you are asking... she is likely to get pregnant when she is ovulating, about 10-20 days before her period starts.  I highly recommend not having sex, or at least using protection, especially if you are unsure about when a girl can get pregnant...|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Yes, you can still get pregnant.  It's a myth that you won't.  If you ovulate when you're on your period, then you can get pregnant.  You can ovulate any time of the month, and are only fertile when you ovulate.|`|cMzvA5Y3aa	yes
5UkfSahsaa	I was on the femodene contraceptive pill for 5 years when I fell pregnant (I didn't use condoms as I have been with my partner for over 6 years and thought the pill would be effective enough). <br>  I always took it regularly and at the end of June 2008 I had a very light period which I thought nothing of. By the middle of July, I was really sick and tired all of the time and discovered I was in fact pregnant - A complete shock as I was always so careful on taking my pill correctly.<br>  I do think there is a possibility it could happen as it happened to me (although my doctor claims this is rare).|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi girl, I got pregnant while taking the pill -- ortho tricyclen. If you took a pill at the wrong time (say, around 12 hours later than you normally would); that could cause the bleeding. If i missed a day on the pill I'd ALWAYS get a day or two of light bleeding -- so annoying. However, that brown, light bleeding, especially accompanied by cramps, could be implantation. I personally don't think you're pregnant, but anything is possible. Hope you start feeling better and best wishes xx|`|758cDKEFaa	i was on the pill when i found out i was pregnant this time round.<br>  i never seemed to take my pills at the same time but i did miss a few without realising and my and my partner dont like to use condoms.<br>  before i found out about a week before certains smells made me feel sick but some did anyway so i didnt think much of it then my period didnt turn up, although some people still get light bleeding or spotting compared to there normal period if they are pregnant on the pill.|`|ee6fd01050dfcfbe7c52c509b9049ff9aa	i had periods up until 20 weeks and the pill isn't100%|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I've known friends to have lighter and shorter periods while on the pill - and no sex involved! So it can just happen randomly. But yes you can get a lighter shorter period when pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think all your other symptoms could be something else, the hot and dizziness sounds more like a virus coming on or dehydration, but like you say, it could be possible if you haven't been good about taking your pills, and you'd have to take a test to know for sure. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|TGzOrftPaa	I got pregnant while on the pill.  I took it faithfully every single day, same time etc...  We also used condoms a majority of the time.  The one time we didn't, I took Plan B within 7 hours of having sex.  2 weeks later, I experienced very light bleeding.  It was only over the course of 2 days and very light pink colored and I experienced cramping.  What I thought to be a period I later figured out was implantation bleeding / cramping.  That's also when I began to have very sore breasts and got very tired!  (I thought I had mono).  So it is possible to get pregnant on the pill, especially if you take it irregularly.  I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear, but you said you wanted to know from people who got pregnant while on the pill.  I hope this was somewhat what you were looking for!  If you're not pregnant, make sure you start taking it at the same time to increase it's effectiveness!!
GWveqx61aa	try man on top or missionary, and stay there after intercourse for about 20 min, only have sex about every 24 hours, but no more than that. take a prenatal. and even though everything is ok with you guys it may still take a lil time to get preg, if you waited a year and nothing, than i would get worried and consult your dr.good luck and baby dust to all of us
rNvXWMOMaa	If I didn't know better, <br>  I would say this question is being asked by someone who <br>  has a spanking fetish and is not 12 years old.<br>  <br>  The answer is NO.. no one deserves a paddling/.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	you've asked this 3 times already so i'm sure it's really bothering you.  and i understand why.<br>  you and your brother used to this all the time.  so why the sudden change in your brother?<br>  well, for one, his girl friend was there.  you have to understand that your brother is different when he's with you and different when he's with his girl.  <br>  secondly, he's an adult now and his mom gave him the responsibility to watch you.  so he was putting on his adult hat at the moment.<br>  my opinion is that you didn't deserve the paddling.  i can tell you're more hurt emotionally than physically so i would talk to your brother one-on-one.  tell him that he hurt your feelings by suddenly changing.  i'm sure you 2 will be better off once you get this out of your chest.|`|FP8Avd3oaa	I think that if he and his girlfriend went to bed, he was then likely mad because his girlfriend got glue all over her as well. If I were you I would apologize to both of them. I think you did for ruining the sheets that is something a three year old would not a 12 year old! So yes!|`|1enIWBGnaa	As long as your mother gave him permission - then YES he can paddle your butt when you misbehave.<br>  He got pissed because he's NOT a child anymore - he's basically an adult.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I dont get what the fascination is about these perverted spanking questions
DU9dx1Uzaa	It probably came back negative because 1. Either you are not pregnant, or 2. If you are, it is too early...Therefore; your hormone levels are too low, so the test can't detect it.<br>  <br>  You need to wait at least one more week, and then take another test.  If you are indeed pregnant, then you should go to the doctor as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  If it continues to be negative, and you still don't get your period, then you should go to the doctor anyways.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BLTo4xL9aa	why don't you go to the clinic and you can ask your question on the doctor.|`|65RZ441Zaa	there is usually a implantation bleeding, that is 6-8 days after conception. Then you should normal miss your period (doesnt mean everyone does). Next would be tender breasts and/or morning sickness. If you've had unprotected sex, or failed protected sex you could be pregnant.|`|ES9N9bOtaa	if you had a bit of spoting u could be but its to early you will get the best resoults if you wait atleast 2 weeks after ur missed period.Oh and the morning is the best time to check.|`|lB405hQKaa	Try testing again with a first response digital test.  If it comes back negative wait a week and if your period doesn't come test one more time and then go to the doctor for a blood test if you still don't get an answer.|`|A0tWlG94aa	you may have to wait a few more days and then test... wait about a week<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x|`|jnSTr31gaa	If you are usually regular and you have had unprotected sex then yes of course you may be pregnant. Try another test to make sure. The more expensive ones pick up any pregnancy hormones from the first day of missed period

eJ539ejpaa	My sons are younger, but one rule we have implemented in our house is you have to eat everything on your plate before seconds. This includes the vegetables.  I do not give large portions, but ie we have say mac-n-cheese, before they get more, a spoonful of a vegetable is required.  Sometimes they refuse the vegetable and then end their meal.  However, there is no snack later.  I have had both my boys go back to the table a few hours later, eat the veggie in order to get a treat.  <br>  We also require our children to try anything new on the table and if they truely do not like it, then that is the end of it.  They eat what is on the table or they do not eat at all.  Either way, they have never gone hungary.  Sometimes, when they try things, they find out it actually like it and want more.  <br>  I have used Ketchup to get my sons to eat meat and vegetables.  Not necessarily the best alternative, but better than cheese.  <br>  I would simply make a meal, serve it and let her sit if she won't try anything.  She will not starve herself.  I piece of carrot or a spoonful of peas is not to much to ask of her.  "Frut a Bu" is a natural organic fruit rollup my kids love.  <br>           My kids love applesauce or sliced apples *(even at McDonald's)<br>                              fruit fresh or canned<br>                              hot dog (turkey) <br>                              fish sticks<br>                              peas, corn, carrots<br>                              mashed tators<br>                              cous cous<br>                              Frosted Mini Wheats<br>                              Raisin Bran<br>                              Granola Bars (usually Kashi)<br>                              Pancakes and waffle- whole wheat<br>     Good Luck and remain firm.  What does she eat at school?  Does she go hungry there?|`|b6EyFLgUaa	It may sound really harsh but make her what ever you guys are eating. Tell her either to eat this or she wont be eating at all. It may take a few days of no dinner ( give her vitamins) but she will quickly learn that if she doesn't eat what you make her she wont be eating at all. Its what we finally had to do to my sister after all she would eat was french fries. My daughter isn't a picky eater but if she becomes one she is either going to eat what the family is eating for dinner or not going to eat at all.|`|C7y6WEVxaa	Okay now this questain gave me a hint that she is a little picky,but not only with food but with you.Heres one thing you could try.Take her to trater Joes or the grocery store and let her pick what she wants out.<br>  If that dosent work take her out to eat and tell her no pizza/mac n cheese and see what she likes.Or simply ask her mother and let the mom show you.Remember dont give in with fast food,NOT GOOD|`|bnbXMlIpaa	im not sure how old she is but there is a product out for children. They are healthy meals that you just have to warm up..i can't remember what its called but if you go n the baby food section and you can find it.  or you and you boyfriend need to wok together and tell her this is whats for dinner and that's it. she will eventually eat it shes not going to starve herself. good luck|`|dKLEBO5Saa	In addition to the other suggestions- have something really interesting looking on your own plate and if she shows interest - hesitate a few seconds (with a smile) and offer her a small bite.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Dont buy it if she get hungry enough she will eat something else I would make a day a week she can either have pizza OR mac & cheese|`|eeaXYyCNaa	She sounds like my step daughter.  I think before I met her father she never ate a veggie.  You have to put the stuff on her plate no matter what.  One day she will try it.  I made my husband pretend to like all kinds of veggies (he hates anything green) or any veggies for that matter.  I just kept putting veggies on her plate.  One thing I found she really liked was Broccoli with Cheese.  I know its still cheese but at least she eats broccoli now.  I also get her to eat salad and all kinds of veggies.<br>  <br>  Just be consistent and she will come around.  She has been taught her eating habits so she will have to be taught to eat better.  It will take some time.  It is very good that you care enough about her to worry about her eating habits.  Most step or soon to be step parents probably wouldn't care so much.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Add things to the mac & cheese. I add spinach to mine because I can't taste it at all, but it still is full of iron. Try adding some chopped ham, or something.  Add toppings to her pizza, either over or under the cheese. If you are super worried about her cholesterol, use soy cheese. I know you don't need to, but as it doesn't have any dairy, it is cholesterol free.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	I wonder how old she is.  Is your boyfriend trying to get her to eat other things too, or is it just you.  If it's just you she might be even more resistant to trying new foods, one of those you aren't my mother things.<br>  <br>  If your desperate, try adding pureed sweet potatoes or other veggies so she doesn't know it's there.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	First of all how old is she to make choices like this? If you know its not healthy then don't give her a choice. Bake some chicken and broccoli put it in front of her and tell her she's not going to get any thing else. When she's hungry she'll eat. Don't give in to her as the adults you do whats good for her like it or not.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Oh hunny your playing with fire here if thats what she wants let her have it. Start her on some vitamins for those extra nutrients she is losing. When you got picky eaters and they have that one thing they want and you just take it away your going to have a mess on your hands trust me. My son ate nothing but soup and peanut butter sandwiches for like 3 months that is all he wanted and his doctor told me let him have it as long as he is eating, but to switch to lower sodium soups. He eventually grew out of that stage and now I can't afford to feed him haha.<br>  <br>  But you really should cut her back on so much cheese your very right through the roof. Start trying new things and say give it a try and I'll give you a quarter that always worked for me when I was little and works for my 6 year old.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Her father is going to have to be the one to change this.  She only eats those foods because he allows it.  No, she will not starve herself.  No child ever voluntarily starved to death.  If your boyfriend serves up other healthy options and doesn't keep mac and cheese or pizza in the house, she'll eventually cave in and eat the other foods.<br>  As a side note, when your boyfriend does make pizza or mac and cheese, they can be perfectly healthy.  Make the mac and cheese with organic, whole wheat macaroni, and low fat, organic milk and cheese.  Adding some chopped broccoli will make it even healthier.  Use organic, low fat ingredients and whole wheat dough or bagels to make pizza.

l0YvaYTDaa	I would suggest allowing her to only eat healthy/fresh foods and encouraging her to become more active (i.e. bike ride, roller blade, play soccer etc.).  I don't know if limiting the amount of food would necessarily be a good idea, but if she's still hungry after a healthy meal, offer her fresh fruits and veges as snacks.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Limit junk foods to one small treat a day and give healthy snacks. Veggies with a little light dip or peanut butter is a good healthy snack most kids like. You can do apples with fat free caramel or strawberries with a little chocolate if you need to dress up fruit. Make sure there is a fruit and veggie served with every meal to fill her up without too many calories. Avoid fried foods, chicken nuggets, mac and cheese, hot dogs, and pizza, make these foods a rare treat. The best thing you can do is cook at home with real foods avoiding over processed boxed meals.<br>  <br>  It's ok for her not to lose weight, she is growing taller and will thin out over time by simply maintaining her current weight. Let her get involved with meal planning and cooking, make it fun. She is more likely to eat healthier foods she had a hand in putting together.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Give her healthier foods.  Eating a lot is not the issue.  Eating bad food is.  Also, let her play outside and get exercise. A lot of kids these days do not get exercise.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Also speak to your doctor or a nutritionist about how many calories your daughter should be eating at her age and height. And what portion size she should be eating. A lot of parents don't realize they are giving their children much more food than the child actually needs. When you see how small a child's portion size is supposed to be, it's often surprising<br>  <br>  I saw a show about overweight kids. They had bowls of different sizes and asked the parents to pick the bowl that best represented a recommended single serving size of pasta for a 6 year old. Every parent chose a bowl that was too big, the average was 30% bigger than a single serving, with some parents choosing bowls holding a double serving for a 6 year old|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	You say she is overweight, but not how much. If she is only 3-5 pounds over there isn't that big of a concern.<br>  <br>  But to help her change her diet to make it healthier. No more sugar coated cereals, no more kool-aid, juice boxes, Little Debbie's, hot dogs, no pop if she drinks it.<br>  <br>  Give her more healthy options. Fresh fruit and vegetables. Make raw fruit and vegetables accessible for her to get and if she likes dipping give her low fat yogurt, peanut butter, or low fat dressing in small amounts.  Switch her to low fat milk.  Look up healthier snacks you can make at home that contain less sugar than if you bought from the store. Diabetic web sites have a lot of good food options that taste great and are very low on sugar. And cheap to make.<br>  <br>  Biggest thing is get her moving. Don't matter what it is find a physical thing she likes and go for it.  Riding bikes, dance, karate, t-ball, soccer, anything as long as it's excerise and you can do it or practice it daily. <br>  <br>  Limit televsion, video games, and computer time to no more than 2 hours.  <br>  <br>  You could also set her up with a doctor to make sure she has no other issues going on or causing the weight gain.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Making meals fun is good. <br>  Meals/or snacks<br>  ants on a log [celery, peanut butter, and raisins]<br>  make carrots in to people<br>  pita chips and hummus<br>  macaroni and cheese with peas, carrots, or celery in it<br>  yogurt with granola, blueberries, strawberries etc.<br>  Chocolate covered strawberries<br>  cucumbers dipped in ranch dressing<br>  <br>  Exercise:<br>  riding your bike to school<br>  ride around the neighborhood on her scooter<br>  dance to music<br>  enroll in sports<br>  yoga<br>  jump rope<br>  hop scotch<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	give her healthier food in smaller portions, teach her about good eating habits and that it's bad to eat too much and bad to not eat at all... get her signed up for sports or dance as well... get her outside riding bikes and runing around..|`|XVljoYZ5aa	If she's always hungry, give her smaller portions. If she asks for seconds, make her wait a full 10 minutes. Often the hunger goes away after her food digests a little bit. Exercising (playing at the park) is much more fun with mommy! Don't mention a thing to her, she doesn't need to be concerned with her weight yet, but you do need to be concerned about her weight. Its good to see a parent who recognizes the issue and is trying to find a healthy way to stop it. Kudos!|`|s9haCi64aa	Well it depends on what food she is eating and portion sizes. The fruit bowl in my house is free for all I never say no to my kids asking for fruit and they can have as much as they want. We have alot of veg with our meals, cut out chips and those processed foods as they are high in saturated fat.<br>  <br>  Also dont listen to the "i dont like it" "im not eating that" Parents need to learn their kids..eat it or go without else they will never have good eating habits. Also exercise on a trampoline or bike riding.<br>  <br>  Portion sizes too apparently each different types of food on their plate should be the size of their hand.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|NwTggQ2Baa	Have her eat healthy foods and limit her meals and snacks per day. <br>  Take her outside or to the park or even just keep her inside jumping around for about 15 minutes each day, that can keep her active and help her loose a few pounds. <br>  You are right, do not give her issues about her weight! She is too young to be worrying about that.<br>  Talk to her doctor about more ways to help he shed a little weight.<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Healthy snacks, no junk food.  Watch how many calories she consuming in liquid.  You'd be surprised at how many calories sugary drinks (including juice) can contain.  Make available all her favourite fruits and veggies.  If she's a dipper, you could give her Yogurt to dip her fruit into.  Make your own veggie dip with fat free sour cream and some dry hidden valley ranch dressing.  <br>  <br>  No McD's, nothing deep fried.  <br>  <br>  All you really need to do is look at the food your consuming. Chances are if the food is tan-brown colored, it's not that healful (grain bread notwithstanding) ... try it, you'll see.<br>  <br>  Also, lead by example.  Make sure you're snacking on the same things ... remember, your children can only consume what you bring into the house.  You're in control here.|`|HyAvpatCaa	go to weight watchers and sign up, then quit so that you can get there book. the book contains all the infomation you need about loosing weight. it will tell you everything about RDA and how many E numbers and kcal etc. - it REALLY helps.

Its all up to u to make it work!!!|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	If you don't want to give her "issues" then don't make it all about her losing weight.  Don't tell her that she needs to loose weight.  That will only hurt her feelings beings she is 5 years old and kids are sensitive.  Make it a family project.  Instead of telling her that tell the the whole family that you want everyone to be healthy and therefore you are all going to eat healthier and exercise together.   Go to the park as a family and take walks or ride bicycles together.  This will also give you quality time with your kids.   Start cooking healthy meals and serve the appropriate amounts.  Don't keep junk food around the house and don't let her brother eat everything that he wants.  She will think you are being unfair to her.  Cook three healthy meals a day and serve two healthy snacks.  Give them fruits and vegetables instead of junk food.   Hope this helps.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	you could just substitute foods in her diet, that way she may not really notice, full fat milk to semi skimmed or skimmed milk, low fat butter/spread, sugar free squash and juice, just try and cut down on fat and sugary foods. If it is junk food she eats; crisps, chocolate, etc then you should try and make her cut down, try and get her to eat fruit instead; strawberries, blue berries, pineapple are all very sweet which will help if she has a sweet tooth. Good luck|`|Cql1rZetaa	Leave fruit, nuts and seeds on the counter. That way, when she is hungry she can only reach healthy things.<br>  Take her for walks and go to the park, have races with her. You could walk to school if you are close enough and don't do already.|`|ywI7XxH4aa	Exercise : ) but disguise it as something fun.  You could go swimming, go to a soft play area, kick a ball round a park, walk on the beach.|`|txv7TIgiaa	just give her healthier snacks like fruits than she wont gain wait... it's no good to say anything about her wieght it could really devistate her!
1G3XPiq3aa	Four months is quite young for them to be starting food. How long a go did you start giving her food? If it's been as long as she's been having hard stools, I would say that's possibly the cause. Honestly, I would just be giving her milk for now. And avoid juice. It won't help with the hard stools, and definitely isn't something she needs this young. Formula will provide all she needs this young, and often their bodies aren't ready to deal with other foods. If this doesn't help in the next couple of days, take her to the doctor.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	maybe she's not ready for solids yet. 4 months is the MINIMUM a baby should start. they say 6-8 months is the most comfortable age to put a baby on solids. since you have been through so many formulas, maybe you should try a soy formula. talk with your pediatrician about the solid situation though...|`|ebM6CxRQaa	How long has she been on solids? He body might not be ready for it... sometimes children have sensitivity to foods it might be what she is eating. If you are switching her formulas a lot this will also cause hard stools. It takes awhile for a babies body to get used to a certain formula. You might have switched and not noticed a difference right away and switched again (I had done this with my son...) and it actually makes the problem worse... try asking the doctor and sticking to one formula for a little while to see if it really works. Once the bowels are messed up it takes a little while for them to get back in order! GL|`|A1QpwziEaa	My baby is 4 months old and all he gets is breastmilk.  Even if I were to introduce food to him right now (which I'm not), it would be a couple of tablespoons of cereal.  It sounds like your baby is not getting enough formula, which should be her main source of nourishment and at this point should be somewhere between 35 and 40oz a day.  I would lower the food intake and make sure your feeding her properly according to her pediatrician.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	try adding an extra ounce of water to her bottles so that it is more dilute, staying with the same scoops|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Give your pediatrician a call. It could just be the transition from formula to baby food. They say 4 months is the earliest you should start them on that.
sxZk6njLaa	Maybe see your doctor if you're worried about your periods, but I'm sorry, I don't think both pregnancy tests will be wrong.|`|AA11764194	It is quite normal.. all periods are not alike.. if you are under stress then it can be more complicated<br>  <br>  and you can NOT be pregnant since you had so many periods after your sex in November..|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	You got negatives pregnancy tests and your period what? three months in a row? Why would you ask if you are pregnant?|`|dq9uclgpaa	If your periods came you should be fine. If your concerned then you should talk to your doctor.|`|NRfqivKPaa	Negative means no! Stop making yourself think you are preggo. You have probably been making yourself gain weight!
xwZKouCIaa	microscopic very very tiny... at this point all it is ia a clump of cells that are constantly dividing and growing..|`|ciquDqIcaa	When it is fertilised it is incredibly tiny, too small to be seen by the naked eyes. It is made up of the blastocoele or blastocyst which contains stem cells that can divide into any type of cell. Therefore this tiny clump of cells is very important for scientists who wish to study into diseases of the cells.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	It is the same size as two cells... one from the mother and one from the father.<br>  <br>  Think... dust particle.|`|WPI0Z47saa	In the very beginning it is smaller than a poppy seed.|`|vue9NOhYaa	At fertilization it isn't an embryo yet.  It's still just an egg, and about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. (The sperm is microscopic, and doesn't affect the size.)|`|1tkFGhU6aa	Implantation will occur week 3 of cycle! The egg and the sperm have met in your fallopian tube and will begin the 4-7 day journey to the uterus. Cell division begins immediately and continues throughout this journey. Once in the uterus, it is generally about 72 hours before implantation occurs. Once it has implanted your baby is called a blastocyst and is about 0.1-0.2 mm in diameter.
3F8f1SoQaa	I would contact your local early intervention program and ask for a full developmental evaluation. It may be that your son will qualify for more PT, some OT and some speech therapy. You might also want to look into teaching him some sign language to help him express himself until he can verbally do so.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	There is obviously something you are not telling us here. Has he been identified as developmentally challenged? Ask you pediatrician for advice.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Typically children walk between 10-14 months. They talk prior to 2 years. Single words appear earlier. Speak with the pediatrician so that a proper assessment may be attained. This is when they will question why you did not call.

01b7b33ffd86cc43730eda548838c61eaa	Ease up on the naughty step - she's not being naughty, just two! You are right to give loads of reassurance.That's the answer, loads and loads. Hugs, cuddles, let her be held like a baby. Bath her, sing to her like you did when she was your baby. Help her put into words how she is feeling, so that she knows you understand. If she throws things or tries to punch him, move him or her away. You could gently say no, so she knows it's not okay, but this isn't a good time to get tough. Try and spend some special time together, and involve her in caring for him. No child has ever been damaged by a little bit more love!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	why dont you take her out for the day and let dad have the new baby, have a mum and daughter day once a month or so|`|pDGVTLoFaa	This is normal try to include her in things that you do for your son let her be mothers little helper. x|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Lots of extra love. Give tons of kisses and hugs. Let her help you with her brother. Make sure you are telling her thanks for all the help and how great she is doing.|`|U3fwQPcjaa	This sounds silly but most of the time it works, buy her a doll, her very own baby. Then, when you have to feel brother, tell her that it is time to feed her baby, get her a chair to sit next to you, make her a part of the experience.<br>  Make sure that she also gets some alone time with both parents, make a mummy and me time for the two of you, if not for 30mins every day than at least once a week, and organize daddy dates, where daddy takes her out so that she is reminded that she is his little princess.<br>  Good Luck!|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Try to find ways to spend time with your daughter. Take her to a library and find fun books to bring home and share with her. Find fun places to go with her. You will need to find a way to devote a little time just for her. You can also find ways to praise her for things she does well. Having a child who is unwell can be stressful for the parent, so you will need to consider whether you are getting enough sleep and downtime in order to take care of other things. Even with a sick child, you still need to attend to other things in your home. Maybe a grandparent can come in and help a little, giving you more time for your daugher, and also helping to give her some grand-parently attention - if possible. Also, two-year-olds can understand a lot. Perhaps sharing a little about your baby and what is going on, in a very simple manner might be of some help. Children appreciate when adults help them to be more 'grown-up' by showing them that the adult knows they can understand some things. Talking to your daughter will help you develop a dialogue that can continue and develop as she grows. Give her lots of love.|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	This is a really tough one but you seem to be taking all the right steps. Kids need to understand that no matter how much you care for them they are not the center of the world. There are boundaries and limitations to acceptable behavior. It's hard to be firm and supportive and it takes a long time too. Stay confident and keep on chugging. If it gets bad enough you may need to consult a therapist.|`|maSZlX5Yaa	Yeah, my big brother who is 14 actually had jealousy when i was born up until i was 4 or 5 but now we are like best friends forever. I think you should take your daughter to Build A bear plz? could you for me?|`|677cd9504a4dd2cc20e08837396ca7adaa	Up until now she has had your undivded attention. It is really hard for her to understand why she has lost that. Involve her with things like helping you ( getting a clean nappy for her brother, or clothes) and make her feel important again. When you feed him, make her a drink at the same time ( and one for you too) and let her sit with you. She just feels left out. I know you cant help having to give your new baby loads of attention, he needs it. Praise her up when she helps and make her feel wanted and useful and some of the jealousy will dissapear. It can be hard to juggle two small childrens needs but if you are positive with her I am sure she will settle down and enjoy being part of a bigger family. Good luck - hope this helps.
2irmTjQ3aa	Maybe you are pregnant and it is just to early for an accurate result, wait a few more days and take another one.|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	I know this is what everyone says but you could be causing yourself so much stress that you are making your period late!  Please whatever you do if you are pregnant and dont want it please dont get an abortion.  Just give it up for adoption!!!|`|AA10473413	There are a whole load of things that can throw off your cycle aside from being pregnant.  Increased stress, change in diet, increase in exercise over the last few months, recent travel/jetlag, and even youth contribute to irregularity.  For instance, a 19 year old woman may expect to experience some irregularity from time to time, as she only releases an egg about one in every three menstrual cycles.  Being a few days late is crazy stressful, but not a guarantee of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you are more than a week late, you may want to go to the doctor and get tested there.  Or you may want to go now, if you think waiting over the weekend will make you tear your hair out!  (I've been there!)|`|twHXC9Draa	adopt please don't be one of the 100,000 of thousands of women to kill their babies! i suggest an adoption program that is if you are going to have a baby after all the test was negative. or u could be one of the loving mothers a child needs in their life^_^ please whatever you do don't regret it!|`|kwMuRDFjaa	I was in the same situation as you before, I went to see my doctor just to make sure. I would suggest the same thing. If you're not sure, go see a doctor and get blood tests done.|`|436460481b75b7b08996a2d69192387caa	get a blood test. It's 100% accurate and with fast results. Stop wasting your money with the usine tests and be done with it. :)|`|11N5NSAqaa	you could have low hormone levels, in which case a pregnancy may not show a positive up until about 8 weeks.  when this happened to me, my dr. advised that a take a test once a week, at the same time of day--preferably first thing in the morning cause that's the best time to tell.  it took 4 weeks for mine to be positive!!<i almost died..i was so shocked>  <br>  if you happen to be pregnant and don't want the baby, it is completely your option on what to do. <someone above said no to abortion..but it isn't their place to say something like that to you.> for me personally, abortion was the best way to go because there was no way i could have handled all the responsibility and commitment that comes with having a child...and i also felt as though carrying a child to full term and then giving it up for adoption would be much more difficult, and also unlikely because of the bond that is formed over those 9 months.<br>   but anyway...try to relax, stressing out about it could have an effect on when your period comes.  also take into consideration any changes in diet or exercise, because that too can play a big part on your period. <br>    best of luck!|`|diT2WFfCaa	Take another test in about 3 days if you still haven't gotten your period, and then follow up with your doctor no matter what the results are.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, you will want to discuss it with them, and if you aren't, they will probably try to determine why your period was so late/missed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8IWwoV5baa	My best advice would be to just chillllll at the moment.  However, if you're normally regular every month, it wouldn't hurt to wait a few days & take another test.  Just make sure it's a good brand, like EPT.  They do cost more, but 99% of the time, they're more accurate.<br>  <br>  Stop stressing girl.  Everything is going to be alright.  [:|`|JLNX5nnwaa	you could be stressed out about it. just relax honey. everything will be fine. sometimes periods arent always regular.|`|QAptQNMOaa	You could wait a few more days to see if your period comes. If it doesnt take another test. Or go and get a blood test.
AA11490722	maybe get a group of your classmates together (at-lest three of you) and go to the principal or guidance counsellor together and explain what has been going on- make sure you tell them about the incident in the change rooms too so that the other teacher can back up your story. Get all your classmates to tell their parent too. <br>  Something should be done about this teacher.<br>  Most important of all make sure you or none of your other female classmates are never alone in a room with him|`|KcwF3yhLaa	Call the cops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|esMek8nWaa	Divorce him'<br>  like kyle did me....<br>  <br>  Just tell the principal i am sure other girls will tell the truth.

Such as your guidance counselor or another teacher you feel comfortable with.|`|hrVGGB4oaa	Okay, I would be scared too. Don't worry. Calm down. Get a bunch of other girls to come with you. The principle has to know or he might do something very wrong. Okay, and 13 or 14??????? You need to tell as soon as possible. If not the principle, tell a teacher your comfortable with. It's gross, and it has to stop.|`|w2kofruFaa	I have a perverted teacher, too... We ended up going to the principal and explaining to him what was going on. When more than half the class verified it, and some of the parents came to complain, the principal had a good long talk with him and he stopped. Meanwhile, cover yourself up so that he can't look.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  My younger brother had a teacher who had "porn" on her computer when he was in 6th grade. After two girls saw it and reported it to the principal, an investigation was undergone, and she was fired because they did find two pictures of a naked guy hidden in her files..<br>  <br>  <br>  In other words, either switch out of the class or find the guts to go tell the principal. It's unlikely that he'll get fired, but it'll at least make him think twice about pulling the same stunts he is now.|`|stcyknAgaa	Hello, <br>  <br>    Avoid him as best you can. As the saying goes "Lay under the radar" which means just do your classwork, don't ask too many questions, save them for this site, I have seen great advice so far, and don't do anything that would need him to correct you on. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck, <br>  B.W.|`|8qbkkbw1aa	Well I don't think he'll hurt you just look at you but if you really really must have him fired either A get pictures of the stuff he does or B put a huge plate of magic brownies on his desk and when he eats them tell the principle that he came to school while under the influence.|`|6hLqzLkcaa	OMG i had a teacher like that...Mr. Niznik uggghh. Anyway, dont get him fired. Tell your dad because he will have something to say. Or when he does that, (my teacher did it to me) I covered up my chest and looked him in the eye and said' Stop looking at me'|`|6EIhzsqoaa	What do you mean don't worry about it?! OMG Report him to the principal ASAP.  First talk to the other girls in your class, and see how they feel.  You guys should all go to the principal together so no one feel uncomfortable or left out.  This is a serious issue, and a big offense.  Sometimes parents think because you're young you blow thing sout or proportion, but make sure you do som,ething about it before it's too alte, and smething bad happens.  ASAP! I mean it! or give me the number to your school & the teachers name.  I will report it myself.  This is not tolerable at all!  Your P.E. teacher is stupid for letting him in. OMG
qFvHH6lUaa	I'd imagine that if you had 4 c-sections, you'll have another.  When they do it, they'll probably ask if you want a tubal.  If they don't, make sure you tell the doctor that it's what you want and they'll do it while they're in there.|`|tlu9wlNAaa	i thought you were only allowed 3 c-sections? but i guess thats a question for your doc hun congrats and good luck i hope everything goes well x
Lnt4u4q6aa	Yes, you did.  Have you showed it too your parents ?  you really should go to an urgent care center and have it xrayed|`|d7kGopYxaa	do u feel nauseous at all when it hurts? If sh u probably did break it.
11N5NSAqaa	relax. you're just scared...it's normal to feel that way after your first time.  the earliest sign of pregnancy is morning sickness/nausea.  other than that different signs include but are not limited to increased sensitivity to foods/smells, breast tenderness, increased thirst, increased urination, and heavy fatigue/sleeping more than usual.|`|iohG0qt8aa	What were you thinking girl!|`|Ms8b2kISaa	It's only been a week honey! Don't worry yourself. A home pregnancy test (HPT) wouldn't work this soon anyway, even if you were pregnant. More than likely, you definitely would have noticed if the condom broke, and chances are the guy would have said something about it, since they are usually even more paranoid about us getting pregnant than we are! If you're bloated, it definitely can't be a sign of pregnancy just yet either. Way too soon. You're probably bloated because you're period is on it's way! That happens to me every month! I need a different size of pants it gets so bad! I suggest waiting for your due date for your next period, and if you get it, you're good. If you don't get it, then it's OK to try a HPT and get fairly accurate results. Try not to stress out too much! That by itself can delay your period! Good luck sweetie! Be careful!|`|0YdWJVyAaa	i am sure you are just scared of nothing actually , as it is highly unlikely that you could get pregnant from the first and only sex you ever had ,plus home pregnancy tests are 99.9% accurate.. the early signs of pregnancy are actually similar to pms, cramps, feeling sick , mood swings, some women get spotting as well.|`|wGVnlrhlaa	Your just scared,, plus when you first loose your virginity your period can sometimes mess up. When i lost my virginity i didnt have my period for 2 months then had it the 3rd month for 2 days. I can almost guarantee your not pregnant. I was in your same situation.
MHOxPs8Oaa	How long were you told to wait? I know there's a minimum of 6 weeks to wait, but wait however long you were told to wait.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Once I had a baby I never wanted my husband to touch me again!  Maybe that's why we're divorced now.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I will tell you personally....do what your doctor says.  Trust me, you don't want to screw up the healing process "down there" if you can help it!!!  If you had stitches/sutures if you tore, I would really recommend waiting.  But if you feel like you're okay to have sex, then I would ask your doctor to see what they think.  I had stitches/sutures as well and it took two months for me to finally heal.  And then I had to have a corrective procedure done because I thought I was healed, but I wasn't completely yet.  It was horrible.  Just be careful! Good luck!|`|AA10753286	i did, and it was fine, i think the doctors are more concern about infection than anything else. <br>  but please please please be careful, even though the sex was good, i was told that if u nurse full time u wont get pregnant, not true, i have 2 children that are 9 months apart, one being premature. so please have some kind of protection. because even though the sex might be alright, u still dont  need to get pregnant so soon.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I had a cesarean, so I can't really help you out.

atmDaT61aa	Try disciplining them. Don't let them get away with that kind of behavior.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Say "Clean your room." They talk back you say, "I made a statement. I did not ask a question and therefore, I should hear no response. What I should hear is cleaning noises coming from your room. So, let's try this again. Clean your room. Now. And if you refuse then you aren't going (insert important event here). And, if I hear any, and I mean ANY complaints or back talk, not only will you not go to (re-insert even here), but you won't be having any (t.v., movie, computer, book...whatever is important to them) time." Also, let them know, that every time they are disrespectful, there will be consequences the girls will not like and that they WILL get those consequences. Words mean nothing if you don't back them up. They disrespect you because you allow it. End of story.|`|AA11124885	Get rid of their toys or any other offense-initiating items.  Make them earn their stuff and privileges back.  You may be surprised to find that possessions aren't as important to them as you thought.  I know it's hard, but it has helped us to clean out stuff that formerly was the "object of dispute" regarding clean up, and even a relief to everyone, kids included, to not have the responsibility of figuring out where to put stuff we didn't really want, anyway.  As for the disrespect and yelling part, maybe it's a throwback from previous marriage.  Counseling may help, even for small kids.  Good luck.|`|AJEYXzIUaa	be CONSISTENT! if you say they will be grounded, make them grounded, never make empty threats or they will never listen or believe anything you say. it will be more work at first, but once they know you say what you mean and mean what you say it will get easier.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	Well if they cant pick up their toys they shouldnt have toys.

txSiQc7Waa	Generally implantation occurs 5-14 dpo, and bleeding can follow the day of or after. As long as it isn't a constant flow, I'd guess it's possibly implantation. Your only real way of knowing will be to wait until AT LEAST the day after your missed period and take an early results hpt.

I like to think that all my previous experience will help with being a first time mommy!<br>  <br>  I'm engaged to my high school sweetheart, we'll be married May 2010 when we're both graduated from college (after almost 8 years of dating). We'll wait a few years to travel and build our careers before we start having kids. Probably start when we're 27-ish and try to have them pretty close to eachother so there isn't a huge age difference. <br>  <br>  I guess these things don't always go as planned tho :-)|`|lynmeenmaa	im 24, want 3 children (boy, girl, boy) and i always wanted to have at least one by the time i hit 28 or 29, but i wont be finished college til im 28 now and wanna be able support my child properly so it looks like ill have to wait til im at least 30 now. :(<br>  i would be happy just having one but i really really want to have my own baby im really maternal and love kids and would absoloutly love my child to bits i know i would. im adopted u see and i have no other biological relations that iv ever met so i see the bond as being extra special that some people just take for granted. <br>  i have one sister she adopted too and always wanted a brother so id love to have a boy and girl at least. im always makin little plans for my kids, names obviously, what kind of schools id send them to, what kind of stories id read to them, getting them a pony so they could learn to ride and respect animals, hahaha i sound like a psycho i not that obsessed but its just really important to me.<br>  <br>  i cant believe i just read a post saying they regretted having their daughter???|`|1S5AbPueaa	I'm 22 and have 2 boys age 3 1/2 and 18 months old.

I plan to start having kids around 24 after my boyfriend and i get married(we're unoffically engaged, we both agree on names and what not and when we plan to get married) i'm looking at having them two years apart.

AA10473413	While cramping during pregnancy is generally a warning sign, it does not necessarily mean there are problems, especially during your first pregnancy.  Do you know how far along you are, though?  That could make a difference in the danger level.  I would recommend calling your doctor to let him or her know and then keeping a careful eye out for spotting.  Make sure you're drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day (dehydration can lead to cramping) and keep an eye on things.  Good luck!|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	yeah you are probably fine but you know what everyone is going to say... ask your doctor. BTW congratulations|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Yes it's normal.|`|FUBNkpwSaa	I also had very awful cramps all the time. i got them mostly when i was being active... (having sex, getting up from the couch, going up the stairs, walking, etc...)<br>  try and figure out if their is anything that could be triggering these cramps. <br>  I know a lot of people said cramps are normal, but throughout i still worried about them and...<br>  I ended up having them throughout my pregnancy and i miscarried at 12 weeks. =(<br>  So be careful, make sure your seeing a doctor regularly and i wish the best to you!|`|avkZGv1taa	For about a week after my period was due I was CERTAIN I was about to start at any minute--so certain that I didn't even take a test until I was about 1.5 weeks late--and I am now 35 weeks with a very healthy little bean.  That being said--I also had horrible cramps for several days before I started bleeding with my 2 miscarriages--I know that's not what you want to hear... hopefully all is well for you and your little one!  Blessings!|`|0YdWJVyAaa	ya cramps are normal during early pregnancy and they used to worry me a lot to the extent that  i had to check for signs of bleeding whenever i used to feel them ,once the cramps were so bad that i wore a pad coz i was sure that i will miscarry .. i didnt and now i have a beautiful baby girl.. so just relax and dont worry , you are safe as long as there is no bleeding .|`|CkkPaP8vaa	Your uterus is expanding from pre-pregnancy at the size of a plum to the size of a grapefruit Week 8 and continually moving up to it’s final resting place with your baby in your belly region so some menstrual like cramping is very normal.  If it is accompanied by light spotting that is normal.  <br>  <br>  Anything heavy or any pain that you feel is unbearable contact your doctor immediately.
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	are you breast feeding? that usually will delay you getting your period.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	It depends. If you're breastfeeding it won't return for a while.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i didnt for like 14 months but i nursed and was on the mini pill i had 3  i think got off the pill and was preggo again|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Same thing happened to me, I had my baby in July and didn't start my period until September. I was irregular and would bleed at random days, but finally I had a normal period in December.<br>  <br>  You're going to be irregular, but it will come back and be normal again, unless you were irregular before.|`|2YBwc4LFaa	It depends. If you're breastfeeding, you might not start for a while. I didn't have mine until 8 months or so after with one of my kids. There's no specific time frame. You're body is still all out of whack and it will take time to get regular.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Call your ob/gyn!|`|86a545b35caa16b409a8e47f9f7218abaa	That can be normal if you are breastfeeding.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Well a job would have been smart, but you waited till you are 7 months pregnant to realize you need stuff. Not too smart I think, especially since you have a 1 1/2 year old.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	There are "earn as you learn" centers in every area. If you are desperate for free stuff you can go take some remedial classes and earn mommy money to buy baby stuff from the center.<br>  <br>  There are also usually charities in your area that give away second hand stuff. Call a church and ask them for a place you can go for help.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	A womens shelter, goodwill, Christians in Action, Salvation Army.  Also go to your local DHS (foodstamp) office and they should have local numbers for places that help out.  Try the WIC offices as well.  My sister was kinda sorta in the same position and she received lots of help from those organizations.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	You could sign up at local churches. they normally have programs that help women with stuff like this. Also check your local craig's list free section. Sign up for Wic, it will help with formula and some of your foods if you breast feed. Ask family and friends to help, have a baby shower, and as soon as you're able, get a job...because your children need support for the future.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Do you have any money at all? <br>  <br>  What a friend of mine did was she she went on Craigslist saying pretty much the same thing you are and asked if anyone had any baby items they are willing to give away. <br>  <br>  some people just want to get rid of stuff so you may luck out.|`|hzAidxdkaa	try not having babies if you can't afford them. I would like to use some of my tax money for my own family|`|p2gMf7JIaa	your doctor's office should have some information on how to obtain help. In the mean time, id suggest birth control so you dont have anymore babies after this one.
65RZ441Zaa	I know the more you go the less you blow. The color is not a sign of being sterile.  everyone's diff, and Porno stars will eat certain food so they have "quality" seamen for filming ;)|`|66KUgS24aa	porno sperm is white because they take herbs like horny goat weed~|`|BLTo4xL9aa	try to search on the books about that or you can search on the internet on how can you solve your problems.|`|R4NDgifmaa	dont worry about the color or texture..the guys in pronos have all types of things done to their penis...some have extra muscle put in to make it bigger who knows they could be having sumthing done there..because my boyfriend sperm dont look lik the guys on the porno either..in i got prego..|`|lB405hQKaa	You're probably fine.

If we BELEIVE we are confident and out going, eventually it will work, right?<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|kR2XGaaFaa	I suggest wearing clothes that you feel comfortable in. That way you will be more willing to talk to people. Also I always feel more confident when I'm with my friends. Hope this helps! :)
45nSn7Rcaa	I was on bed rest for the last month of my pregnancy 9 yrs ago and had two 6 yr olds already...that was tough...so I hope you don't have to, but if you do...just keep in mind that when it starts getting to you that before you know it ....it will be over and your baby will be here.<br>  <br>  As for getting things ready too early, I don't thing at this point that you could do that.  Start now and enjoy every minute of it.  Makde sure you have a car seet...first thing you'll need in order to bring your baby home, make sure you have a crib, stroller, plenty of receiving blankets, undershirts, sleepers and diapers, cream, powder, baby bath, baby wash, bottles and formula if you are going that way, breast pads etc if you are breastfeeding.  Some of those things you may get from others, but it is so much fun to get them yourself so go out and enjoy.  Congratulations|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	im 23w 4d and now i am finished!!|`|Knierqi9aa	Well, if you have a room for the baby, painting and getting furniture set up is fine to start.  But, dont open packages, boxes yet incase you end up needed to exchange stuff, which you might not know until later.  I got a gift off my registry that ended up not being what I thoguht it was, so exchanged it for something else we could use.  Also, my 2nd child was bigger and only wore newborn sizes for a few weeks and would have done jsut fine in 0-3 mos. right from the start.  But for the big INFANT items (car seat, crib sheet, a FEW infant sleepers and blankets), go aheahd and ahve them ready by 32-24 weeks.  Have fun w/this time!
dLadxEJSaa	Someone would have to have defecated on it for me not to want to eat it.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Well since chocolate brownies are MY biggest weakness, too, I imagine I would eat a stale one also.  <br>  I guess if someone smeared dog poo all over it I wouldn't eat it, but short of that, I dunno.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	It has to be so stale that its unable to chew.|`|snUDfcfgaa	It would have to about 20 minutes overcooked, burnt to a crisp.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Nothing short of mold will prevent me from eating a brownie.|`|vKYdV5r2aa	if it is hard you dunk it !<br>  if it is green and fuzzy you toss it !<br>  OH and MMMMMMMMMMMM Chocolate !!!!!!|`|X6as2nOAaa	If it is chocolate then it takes a lot for me not to eat it. I have had a hard brownie before and I was like this is gross it is way to hard like rock solid yet I went and got out the milk to I could drink and eat it together so it wasn't hard and I have also went and got the ice cream and mixed it together. You think I would just have thrown it away but I didn't.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The time I made brownies and then used mint icing had to be that defining moment. It was like eating brownies smeared with toothpaste. Blech - they went directly into the trash!<br>  <br>  But stale? Nah, they still have a lot of life left in 'em by then. They'd have to fall into the trash, maybe, before I wouldn't, and that only depends on what else was touching them. LOL|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I am allergic to chocolate, dairy, eggs, and flour, so it is quite easy for me to say "NO Thanks, I'm allergic".|`|2N6KEoVqaa	It would have to be pretty bad!! LOL If it's stale, I'd pop it in the microwave with a damp paper towel around it. ALL BETTER. Even if I didn't have a microwave or damp paper towel, though, if it still resembled chocolate or brownie (not necessarily both) I would still eat it.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	if i cant bite into it i guess i would throw it away<br>  <br>  i dont think awful and chocolate brownie belong in the same sentence lol|`|A5JCdps7aa	i would have to say if it didn't taste like a brownie. you know those disgusting kind that taste like expired hard fudge?<br>  i hate those cheap kind of brownies...they're not even brownies! (one time i ate one and it tasted like minty fudge...MINTY)|`|AA10186411	It has to make me want to gag in order for me not to eat it! haha I experienced this too the other day while eating a cookie. It was so stale and pretty gross...but I kept on chewing lol|`|AA11447210	There was a time that I'd eat it even if it wasn't yummy, because food was comfort and/or I was bored.<br>  <br>  Now, I try to watch my weight which includes what I put in my mouth. A lot of times I'll get a treat or something and if it isn't something I'm actually enjoying eating, I'll not finish eating it. I now consider if the taste/enjoyment is worth the calorie consumption.|`|AA11537580	mouldy or dropped on the floor|`|AA12145826	I'm pretty sure it would have to be something pretty gross....or green....or crawling...<br>  <br>  Ok, I'm making myself nauseous....I need to stop....I'm ruining all that is holy about Brownies!!!|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Oooh that's only happened once when I accidentally put salt instead of sugar. I almost gagged. They look exactly the same and I have my salt and sugar in little tupperware containers. I don't like the salt box or sugar bag to stay open all the time so I put them in tupperware.<br>  <br>  Salty Brownies YUCK!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	it would probably have to have soap or poo or something on it.  once i start it, unless it has something inedible on or in it, i will finish it if its something i love.  regardless of how stale or poorly made it was.  i am pregnant and love food to begin with. :)|`|PeoOb4aHaa	Depends on how badly I feel at the time.|`|WirFwirLaa	Hard, cake like brownies....yuck, no thanks!<br>  <br>  Ooey, gooey brownies are my choice!|`|aZXnW6AUaa	eat it fresh|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Lol@ Miss Ellie....perfect answer.<br>       Yeap. I've never met a brownie that didn't get eaten...not yet anyway.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	It would have to be hard as a rock stale.. or covered in mold or just have a generally horrible taste. (which face it... most brownies are just damn yummy)|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	It has to be either stale and very hard or very mushy like for me not to eat it.|`|BM9oGl8maa	too much frosting or fudge and sprinkles would stop me right there, especially if its dark chocolate. otherwise, stale, expired, and covered in (or mixed with) gross stuff is pretty bad. brownies are too sweet for me and i like them in ice cream because they make ice cream seem chewy and the cream balances the sugariness.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	It has to be made of dirt and mud and other wonderful delights. Haha.|`|PgBiP4enaa	try making the nastyest brownie ever like with viniger then eat it it should grose u out enough never to eat one again but you have to put it brownie form so your brain will know wat to stay away from your mind will remind you of that nasty taste!|`|XgbIJkcmaa	A purple spotted tree climbing zebra with a belly button deformity would have to die on it for me not to eat that brownie. xD|`|a1uoxczTaa	i hate brownies r unbelievably hard. yuck. but when it is still soft but stale, i say it is ok|`|i9MKTn26aa	Ellie don't knock it til you've tried it!<br>  <br>  Honestly I don't like bitter tasting chocolates, so that would be enough for me.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Covered with bits from the garbage. That is bad. Unless those bits are edible, then maybe...|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I think it has to be molding before I won't eat it, lol.  <br>  <br>  I have eaten brownies that are as hard as a rock.  I love my chocolate.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	hard as a rock or very salty|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Just dunk it in the milk a little. It will be fine.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Honestly? I don't care what's wrong with it. Mold? That'd be about it. But would mold grow on that? LOL. <br>  <br>  Whatever, just put some ice cream over it and it STILL taste good. And it'll soften up too!|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Unless it's started growing mold, it's still edible.<br>  <br>  LOL
vygYFdsSaa	8 weeks is pretty soon to be showing; you're probably just bloated. You shouldn't be too worried about a lack of symptoms it might just be that you're lucky.|`|VJpdmd0waa	I didnt and still dont have any symptoms.. <br>  If my belly wasnt getting big I wouldnt think I was pregnant.<br>  Its normal some people just dont have symptoms an we are lucky. lol|`|lCxcfisfaa	Yes, it's normal. I have read that every woman is different. I am 4 weeks myself and only have sore boobs and that "im going to start my period' feeling. Everything is fine ... ask at your next exam or call if your really concerned.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	every pregnancy is different. Dont worry. Some people get "morning sickness" right away, in the middle, at the end or not at all. There are not set "symptoms" Be happy you are feeling well :) its not so good for many. COngrats on baby|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Some people can feel their clothes become snug as early as that. <br>  <br>  Not too many symptoms is fine. Some women throw up like crazy and have back ache, for others it is plain sailing!|`|eXg0ozLnaa	i'm 13 weeks and have never had a single symptom. i had a scan on tuesday and they said everything seems fine. Dont worry, think yourself lucky!|`|RM3vIeDVaa	I am the same as Kara,<br>  I'm 4 weeks pregnant and apart from the sore boobs and the paranoid feeling that my period is going to start any minute I have no other symptoms.<br>  <br>  Sometimes i don't even believe i'm pregnant....i guess i need something physical to believe
077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	This happened to me. It's just white blood cells in your urine or in other words, a uti. Its prob just very mild and if you drink more water would clear up on its own.|`|fea7e4fed10b730f23d1472cfd309922aa	It's not a UTI unless your urine has been cultured and has showed there is bacteria in there.  If you have pain, frequecy, or urgency then you might have a disease called Interstitial Cystitis.  People with this disease do get white blood cells in their urine without having a UTI.
Bw1h5xAcaa	It won't kill you or your baby. Many women can't control what position they sleep in all night long. <br>  <br>  They tell you to avoid lying flat on your back in later pregnancy because the weight of the uterus / baby compresses the major blood vessels that run along your back, which can decrease blood flow through the placenta - but it's not enough to cause serious problems or anything. <br>  <br>  If you want to lie on your back, you could take a little pillow and put it under one hip just to tilt you slightly to one side - it's enough to displace the weight off those big vessels and you'll be fine.|`|T48smu01aa	Everyone can give me thumbs down but I am almost 28 weeks and I still sleep on my back.....I told my midwife I can't breathe when I sleep on my side and its really uncomfortable.....she told me as long as I can breathe on my back I can sleep on my back....she said you will know when you can't sleep on your back.....If you feel comfortable on your back sleep on your back by all means :) <br>  Good luck sweetie and congrats<br>  If you are really concerned talk with your doctor.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I am 29 week I will 30 tomorrow. I still find my self waking up on my back. Last night was one of them. I sleep with 4 pillows so my head is and back is propped up. If I am flat on my back it makes it hard for me to breath. Even laying on the couch I have a mound of pillows!|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	Don't get used to it.  You can probably do that at 17 weeks, but as you get bigger, the weight of the baby can cut off circulation to your legs if you continue to sleep on your back.|`|iPGxXRHgaa	Its ok to sleep on your back this early on in the pregnancy. Its later on that you should ovoid it. I found that in the later stages of pregnancy i couldn't sleep on my back, as it was very uncomfortable, the pressure is unreal|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	No you shouldn't this is about the cutoff line for sleeping on your back. You could cutoff blood flow to the baby.  Try switching to your right side and using pillows in between your legs or other areas of your body for more comfort.  Good Luck.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i keep asking my dr the same question! im 36 wks and still sleep on my back at times-weird at this point-but she says its fine and not to worry about it as long as im comfortable.
p8WE47xIaa	It is very normal.  When my son was learning to walk he had the same thing happen.  I was paranoid too.  If it gets too bad then see if she will let you put a cool rag on the bruises.  Or there are these they are cool packs.  I have seen them is stores every where.  Good luck I hope I helped.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.greatbabyproducts.com/v/vspfiles/photos/SASS-443-2T.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.greatbabyproducts.com/Child_Cold_Pack_Pouch_p/sass-443.htm&usg=__zRUM2rN8H5H1maa9p0jTqP0e1Hk=&h=150&w=256&sz=18&hl=en&start=12&um=1&tbnid=MHdY3HR_g5KeRM:&tbnh=65&tbnw=111&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dchild%2527s%2Bcool%2Bpack%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a>|`|DKqsFGymaa	LOL, very normal and every mother has that fear that social services will be called on them!<br>  <br>  I think the authorities are familiar with the bruises that come with a child learning to walk.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Totally normal! Every day during bath or diaper changes I'm examining my daughter's little legs and say "Where did this come from?!" LOL Right now she's got a bruise on her head from bumping into something. They're just learning how to navigate - they'll be bumped and bruised for awhile! (and then it gets worse once they're older LOL)|`|KmC0K59taa	This is perfectly normal.  My toddler is 22 months and still regularly has bruises.  Noone is going to say anything to you or accuse you.  Anyone who's had kids knows that is is normal.
dXVA1wHDaa	Oh chick, can your partner or anyone else take her for a night or so, just so that you get the chance to have a decent sleep?  I know you probably don't want to stop breastfeeding, but could you possibly use a top up bottle last thing before bedtime and see if that helps?  Is she looking for milk or comfort do you think? <br>  <br>  Sorry I'm asking loads of questions, but babies are so hard to read sometimes!  Is she by any chance coming up on 4 months?  My son started waking during the night again at 4 months, and a few other people on here have also experienced this, so it might be a growth spurt.  Try swaddling her if she'll allow it, maybe try bathing her before bedtime, if you don't already do this, try the johnson's bedtime bath range, the lavender really relaxes.  Or if you're worried about her skin reacting to it, you can get a lavender balm suitable for adults, you could put some one before giving her a last night time feed.<br>  <br>  You might have to try a number of things to help her settle, hope you get a rest soon!|`|Uz16kQEYaa	Go to a herbal shop and get some raspberry leaf tea.Give her it instead of water.It has brilliant calming effects.<br>  My youngest son was terrible,he felt the motion of me putting him down from birth and his eyes would ping open.<br>  Someone recommended this to me,i never looked back after that.The health visitor couldn't believe the change in him,so she said she would recommend it to other parents.|`|kY29gYhjaa	try using the 'swaddle' method of wrapping your baby up, just wrap her in a blanket or even a sheet so she feels snuggled, it gives baby a sense of security that she feels when she is in your arms, you could also try putting some form of you clothing after you have worn it for a couple of hours in with her when she sleeps so she can smell you. i had the same problem with my son and as soon as i started doing this at about the 3 month stage he began to sleep from 6pm till 8 am!|`|UOybpxsfaa	I am sorry you are having problems believe me so many of us have been through this and come out the other side it does get better. Do you think maybe she has colic does she draw her legs up ,if so put the palm of your hands under the soles of her feet and very gently push them up towards her tummy. I hope you get some advice that helps I can remember what it was like  it is a long long night and you think you are the only person in the world up at that silly time believe me you are not you are just being a mum and it does pass|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Maybe pump and let your SO do a feeding or two at night so you can get some rest? That's really the only suggestion I have because I never had this problem. Hope you find something that helps.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Do you have a baby swing? Or a vibrating baby chair? They are WONDERFUL!<br>  <br>  I have this great vibrating baby chair. I fasten my 2 month old in it when she starts getting sleepy, and rock her, and she might cry for a little while but she'll go to sleep before 10 minutes is up and she'll sleep for hours. Last night I buckled her in and she passed out. I covered her up to keep her warm and she slept all night for 9 hours for the first time. I could have cried I was so happy.<br>  <br>  Give it a try, it's so great. If that doesn't work, a swing is wonderful. I don't have a swing, but she has one at her grandmothers (her grandma watches her while I'm at work), and she says that the baby loves it and goes to sleep after swinging for a short while. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you can get some rest, I know how you feel and it's not fun. *hug*|`|0AJRl2K9aa	It's one of two things; (1) she's hungry, i.e. your milk isn't satisfying her fully, which isn't uncommon, and you may have to start giving her a formula bottle before she goes to bed at night or (2) she may have colic or just be very prone to wind, which is also not unusual.  I know you would prefer to breast feed longer, which isn't a problem, but you may have to give consideration to giving her a formula bottle.  Good luck.|`|HkMWkrUNaa	Hunny, you sound like you are in the same boat as I was when my daughter was younger. The one thing they don't warn you about with breastfeeding is that you also always smell of milk, which is comforting to your baby, putting the baby down takes that smell away from then, which could be why she is getting upset, so you could try swaddling her, and having her lay next to or near a hankie which has been tucked in your bra or something.<br>  It may be worth asking your health visitor for advice on whether to convert you little girls last feed to a formula feed - like the hungry baby, or night-time formula's (please, only do this once you've spoken to your HV), also, if possible, get your partner to give this feed, so that your BM smell isn't close to her.<br>  I know it seems endless at the moment, but your baby will get used to being put down to sleep, and to sleeping through.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and I hope you find the right answer for both you and your baby.|`|03szAlNvaa	At three months my daughter was the same, she is now four months old and starting to wake up twice a night for feeds which is more manageable. You say you have a bouncy chair but as other mums have said, a swing is really good. I wanted to only breastfeed for at least a year in the last week i hate to give her formula twice, she slept throught the night both those times and was in a really good mood for the whole day which was great! It will get better and you're not on your own. Hope things get better soon. If she sleeps ok during the day, try to nap with her if you can. I always had short naps in the evening a few hours before her bedtime and it gave me that little bit of energy to get through the night.|`|2dvXGnQPaa	From what I understand, at 3 months babies go through another growth spurt, so maybe hopefully your daughter will settle back into a good routine in a few days.<br>  <br>  My daughter is almost 3 months old, and has been knocking the wind out of me since day 1.  I'm not looking forward to her upcoming growth spurt because I know it will be hell.<br>  <br>  I've started having my mom come over one night a week whether I plan to go anywhere or not.  She cries for much of the evening, and I know it sounds callous, but I ignore it because I know that my mom is taking care of her and that she'd be crying for me, anyway.  But at least for a couple of hours I can detach myself.<br>  <br>  If your daughter has a hard time settling down if she's not in your arms, maybe try having someone else wear your housecoat or wear something that smells like you while they hold your daughter.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|m9ln4fwXaa	do you have one of those electris/battery operated baby swings. my baby was the same and when i got a baby swing she loved it and would always get her to sleep. if you do decide to get one and your always on the go i would get the smaller porteble swing rather then the bigger ones you can get. <br>  <br>  as for sleeping through the night i was lucky she went through the night from 5 weeks old and all i did was after she had a feed put her in her moses basket/cot. when she went on a bottle i put her in her cot and held her bottle stroking her head untill she was alseep so she new i was there. i also used johnsons baby bath set and that helped alot. mainly having a routine and stuck to it done the job. whne your baby holds a bottle by them selfs it will get easier and then you can slowly move out of the room. <br>  <br>  good luck and remember it wont always be like this. make the most of it because when they get older you will miss these days lol|`|wTSuIFgkaa	sounds like she's hungry or need's winding. formula milk works best reagardless what the midwife tell you|`|a0f425d254acb40e8acdbd9e543034e9aa	try letting her sleep in a swing.  my kids slept in their fisher price swing until they were about 5 months.  naps and night time sleeping...  it was a life saver!|`|vLWs9Gbsaa	((((((Hugs))))). Do you have anyone to help you? Please dont feel like you cant or shouldnt ask for some extra help or a couple of hours to yourself.It doesnt make you a 'bad mumy' and it's amazing how good you feel with even just an extra nap or hour sleep. <br>  <br>  My health visitor told me when my little one was doing this, that under the age of 1 year, if they are crying, it's for a reason. I know it might sound obvious, but they usually only cry cause they are wet, hungry or tired.<br>  You said you wanted to breast feed longer, but even with the best of intentions, sometimes you have to go with what they want. I would really consider bottle feeding, for your own sanity if nothing else! I loved breast feeding too, but it is knackering, especially if you are not getting any time to yourself and sometimes it can feel like they are constantly hanging off you! There's no reason why you cant continue to breast feed and bottle feed, maybe try just a bottle at night? If she is waking alot, it might be cause she is hungry? She might even be teething.<br>  The vibrating chair suggestion is a good one, she may not take to at first, but after a couple of tries, she will love it! <br>  <br>  Have you considered that she might have colic also? Babies tend to start getting it about this age and it usually starts in the early evening. You can buy Infacol from all pharmacies (Im from the UK), give it to her before each feed, it's supposed to break down the bubbles in their tummies, making it easier for them to burp when winded.<br>  Most importantly though, try to stay calm when she is screaming the house down, they can feel much more than you think and if she is sensing that you are tense and upset, she will feel the same way too. Just jiggle her and rock her, my little one loved 'white noise' sounds, I would make a low humming sound or a 'wooshing' sound and it always calmed him. This phase will  pass though, you just need to find your feet with each other, like all parents. Dont beat yourself up too much about, you're doing the best you can. <br>  Speak to your Health Visitor or a good friend. Venting helps! Try a site called Babycentre, they have message boards where you will get alot of support and advice too! I hope any of this helps. x

They run $100 specials around here (dallas, texas) all the time that I see. <br>  <br>  However, if I were you, I'd wait until at least 30 weeks. I know several people who have had it done, and they just didnt get those realllly good pics like you see online like a the ones that are 30+ weeks.

1VOsRV8Maa	With my first pregnancy, it stopped immediately at 12 weeks. Then it started back up around 35 weeks and stopped right before I went into labor. I'm now 12 weeks pregnant with #2, and I've only thrown up twice. I don't really get sick this time around. With two of my sisters, they were sick from the beginning to the end. It's different with every woman. Eat things with lots of protein. I ate eggs (Scrambled, cause I hated the taste of the runny yolks), peanut butter, beans, etc. High protein foods will help ease the nausea. Also, try preggie pops or just any hard candies to suck on. They will also help. I would also eat lime popsicles (Lime helps ease nausea), or suck on peppermint candies. Good luck! Hope your sickness goes away! God bless you and baby!|`|nAOlBmzDaa	started at about 9/10 weeks, lasted til about 13 weeks... its gone now, thank GOD!!!|`|ZMFeQG7yaa	with my first it lasted 2 months and with my second it was the entire pregnancy... there was not a day that went by that i was not either sick or feeling sick.... if it is severe enough your doctor could prescribe you some medicine that helps with it.|`|v8AYoQPeaa	1st baby: whole pregnancy<br>  2nd baby no moring sickness<br>  3baby nothing yet only 4weeks prego<br>  i have 2 girls and pretty sure this baby is going to b a girl too.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Not to scare you, but I'm 35 weeks and some days pregnant and STILL have morning/all day sickness.

WbJPQM1naa	Statistically, children of alcoholics are over 50% more likely to grow up to alcoholics.  <br>  <br>  The disease of alcoholism affects the entire family, which is why recovery is also recommended for family members through Adult Children of Alcoholics, Al Anon and Al Ateen groups.  Depending upon how the parent functions, how the other parent enables the addiction and what is said about it, children can get caught up in several unhealthy roles in the family structure.  Most are unhealthy ways of relating and behaving within the family structure.  Also, children can be prone to accepting responsibility for the alcoholic, when they really have no control over their parent's disease.  And children of alcoholics are also prone to grow up to marry an addicted partner.<br>  <br>  I'm a child of an alcoholic and have been in a marriage with an alcoholic.  I had to end my marriage because I realized that my children needed to have a healthier life and home.  <br>  My ex drank, and was very selfish.  He was abusive verbally as well.  When my young son (7) began to mirror his father's disrespectful behavior towards me, I really knew I had to change our situation.  I knew that my kids deserved to be free from his addiction and the chaos he brought to our home.  <br>  <br>  Alcoholic parents really don't want to understand that their addiction is hurting those around them.  If they haven't yet reached a place where they can admit they are alcoholic, they are even more unable to take personal responsibility for the effect they have on others.  Their partners may play a role in enabling the alcoholic by covering for them or allowing them to continually shift the blame for their addictions.  The children, seeing these behaviors, learn some unhealthy ways of relating to others and coping with life's problems.  Or they learn to enable others.  They also might struggle with trust: first of their own perceptions and second of others.  Because of the instability of their family, the chaos and the learned behaviors, children of alcoholics will grow up to have trouble choosing positive partners, having healthy relationships and coping with life without the use of drugs or alcohol.  <br>  <br>  There are tons of publications on this subject!  Here's some online articles for you read.  As well, there are a few good books you might want to look into.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/homework/a/blchild.htm" rel="nofollow">http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/homework/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healtalk.com/public/37.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.healtalk.com/public/37.shtml</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://allpsych.com/journal/alcoholism.html" rel="nofollow">http://allpsych.com/journal/alcoholism.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.addictionrecovery.net/alcohol-abuse-at-home-how-does-alcohol-addiction-affect-children/" rel="nofollow">http://www.addictionrecovery.net/alcohol...</a><br>  <br>  Here's some good books:<br>  <br>  "CoDependent No More"  by Melodiy Beattie<br>  <br>  "Adult Children of Alcoholics"  by  Janet G.

Take good care and if you're struggling in this area, get help!  Look up Alcoholics Anonymous online and find a meeting in your area.  They can also lead you to Al Anon, which is for families of alcoholics.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  R|`|F6lZHRkVaa	It depends on the level of alcoholism. My father was a functioning alcoholic, so for me his alcoholism equaled Party Time. We always had tons of people over and my dad was very silly and fun when he was drunk. So for me, between ages 14 and 28 or so, I thought a party was where everyone is supposed to get drunk.<br>  <br>  My ex had an abusive alcoholic father who couldn't keep a job. He grew up an abused child, and now he's very mistrusting and very controlling over everyone. He was also violent on occasion.<br>  <br>  One thing about almost all children of alcoholics - when they get older they're more likely to be able to hold their alcohol. Whether or not they actually drink, most of them (not all of course) can drink a lot more than their peers before becoming drunk. Back in my party days, I could down 12 beers in one sitting and still stand up straight. The chances of a child of an alcoholic becoming an alchoholic themselves is pretty high too. I was lucky I never became one, but many kids face that risk.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends on the parent and how they respond to alcohol. Some are mean and hit their children and spouses, or rage at everyone for no reason. Some sulk. Some pass out, and some act funny. Personally I don't think I'd ever want my children to see me drunk because it does not set a very good example. And it's sad that in the one poster's case it caused her to think that no party would be complete without alcohol. I'm sure she realizes differently now, but still, it's sad to project that image to a teen who is very impressionable. <br>  <br>  Besides, being drunk can affect your judgment. I read not too long ago where the child of an alcoholic nearly drowned in the toilet and she had no idea. The kid could have died. So in some cases, I guess you could say it could be fatal.|`|u94HOVz7aa	my father drank like a fish.? i wont go near the stuff when i am have my children.? every once in a while i will drink, but only and i say ONLY if i have someone to watch my children.? my husband and i wont drink together unless the children are with a sitter, because i remember my father.? when my mom was away we could do just about anything.? as long as we didnt get my dad attention.? if we got his attention then he could get really mean really fast.? i learned how to minipulate a drunk at a young age. (not something i am proud of)? and i dont want my kids to go through that.? so there for there is rarely ever alcohol in my house.? i dont mind others haveing a couple drinks around my kids but if you wanna get slobbering fall down drunk don't expect to do it in my house.? I saw what it was like growing up adn my kids dont need that!!!!!<br>  <br>  besides that children of an alcoholic parent are more likely to become alcoholic themselves.? which is one reason i try to stay away from the stuff i dont want to go down that road and it could be a short ride for me.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	It all depends. Some people who are alcoholic are so 'immune' to it, they can drink a great deal and not show a lot. All alcoholics are certainly not violent, all are not mean.<br>  <br>  I am not defending anyone who is an alcoholic parent, but some do not do terrible things to their kids.Sometimes the kids become the parents and vice versa. Kids sometimes have to help the parents, maybe fix dinner if the mother is too drunk, get the younger kids off to school if the parents are hung over, things like that. Kids of alcoholics are either more likely to drink themselves, or never touch it. <br>  <br>   But it is always hard on the kids. I knew kids who had alcoholic parents and also relatives and friends. A girl in her teens thought it was perfectly normal for parents to be drunk and could not understand other kids' parents who did not drink, like there was something wrong with THEM. These were not abusive people, although they talked about things that should not be discussed in front of kids.<br>  <br>  Of course the abusive ones are much worse, but there are abusive parents who don't drink. Often if there is one parent who drinks and the other does not, he or she is an 'enabler' who makes it possible for them to continue drinking to keep from having problems or even abuse, especially if the husband is a drinker who can be abusive to his wife and/or kids. <br>  <br>  I know I sound like I'm defending alcoholics, I'm not, but they can't all be put into one thing.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Well... My sisters grades are suffering in school, she has NO friends, and is not much of a social person. My brothers (18, 21) not only drink with her, but also smoke weed with her. My youngest brother is doing good despite all of this, though he can be a bit moody at times..<br>  <br>  Me..it affects me like this, there is nothing i can do about it because CYS can't proove that it is all going on, either that or they have "more serious cases to deal with"... It also affects me because our mother drinks and drives..if something were to happen i'm the only one capable of taking care of my 15 and 13 year old siblings who are the only minors still in the "care" of our mother.<br>  <br>  Add in there the two older boys do nothing with thier lives, still live at home with her, have no jobs, and have no abition in live.. My 18 year old brother also has a child!|`|pcoa5zH2aa	Sometimes it makes the kid feel like they did something wrong, which caused their parent to be an alcoholic.  Some feel embarassed.  Some feel alone.  Some feel like their parent is stupid.  There's so much more to it.  I guess it just depends if someone else is there for them.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	My husbands dad drunk like crazy & my husband wants to but dont bc he is quite dumb when he drinks My father is horrible with drinking & i have NEVER tuched it. so i think it depends on hoe the parent acks drunk & who the child is
miPubuDYaa	Every person is different and every pregnancy is different too. Normally the doctors say you can't feel your baby move in your first pregnancy untill 18-22 weeks. So at 17 weeks its completely normal. He moves around alot, he's just so small you dont feel it. You will!<br>  <br>  Next visit ask your doctor about it. You might have anterior placenta. Which if is the case you will feel very little movement. It just means the baby is behind the placenta. You doctor can do a sonogram and show you that he is moving to reassure you.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Everyone is different.  Don't even start to worry most people don't feel their babies until about 20 weeks.  Many people do think they feel their babies move early but it ends up that it's probably gas or twinges in their growing uterus's.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	hi lil honey every one is different when i was pregnant i  didnt feel my baby till i was 20 weeks|`|i8Ch743Laa	Don't worry about it. Your doctor would tell you if something was to be worrid about,so call them. I know that some women don't feel it that early. I felt this one from 13 weeks on,but i am also the third time pregnant,so yea. It all depends on the woman's size/body build as well,so I would mention it to the dr if youre worried about it. It's not something to worry over. Some women don't feel it this early.|`|AA10186411	Thats completely normal.  I felt my daughter at 17 weeks and a few days.  It all depends on your prepregnancy size and the position of your placenta.  It may be in the front, and its absorbing your babies kicks so you can't feel it!  Don't worry until you reach 22 weeks and still haven't felt it.|`|4kX61Y97aa	sometimes it take abit longer alot of woman feel baby kick at 18-20 weeks alot of woman do dont worry the baby may be kicking but your just not noticing<br>  <br>  have something fizzy then lie on your back, if your really worried speak to your midwife but im sure everythings fine <br>  <br>  all the best and hope everythings fine<br>  x|`|VJpdmd0waa	Every person is diffrent but check with your doc if you are worried.<br>  Good Luck|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Every woman is different.  I feel my baby (at 19 weeks) but its like one kick and only every other day...if that.  I went to the doctor yesterday and everything looks good (baby was wiggling around like crazy although I couldn't feel it) so its perfectly normal not to feel any and every movement this soon.|`|claUGpVRaa	Don't worry, everyone is different. I first felt mine move at about 17.5 weeks, then it went mad and hasn't stopped since and I am term + 1 day today!!! Still kicking like mad but showing no signs of putting in an appearance!<br>  It will happen soon enough for you, don't worry!|`|0s93q8Ocaa	If this is your first baby, you may not realize the movement until the baby is a bit bigger.  However, if you are worried, please talk to your doctor.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If this is your first, most people don't feel their first until into their early 20's in weeks.  Everyone is different, but the more babies you have the earlier your feel movement.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Everyone is different. If this is your first baby then its normal not to feel kicks up until 20 or 22 weeks!! Im 14 weeks pregnant with my 4th an have felt kicks from last week!! :)|`|TiaoTFecaa	Could sometimes not happen till 20 weeks it depends on your body figure|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I didn't feel anything until I was 20 weeks. Relax honey.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	Calm down. This is completely normal- especially if this is your first child. some movement can be mistaken for gas and therefore you do not know it is your baby. Also your body type can play a part if you are a little thicker then that will cause you to not feel it till the baby is bigger and stronger. Also the implantation of the placenta. . . if it is implanted in the front of your uterus then the movement will not be felt till later because the added barrier. I am almost 17 weeks as well and everyone tells me it could be a few weeks yet till i feel the movement and it wont be strong kicks till weeks after that. Hang in there!!!|`|fZGBjtpVaa	I shouldn't worry about it too much.  If you're really concerned then talk to your midwife, I'd suggest letting her know if you still haven't felt the baby move at 20 weeks.<br>  <br>  Could it be that maybe you have felt it move, and you've disregarded it as something else?<br>  I thought I was feeling trapped wind, or gas when I was pregnant with my daughter.  Turned out to be her moving, I felt like such an idiot lol.|`|n7zYstbgaa	If you are going to your doc for regular check ups you should be fine.  I understand how you feel.  I went thru my entire pregnancy with almost no movement.  Toward the last couple of months I felt a tightness on my lower right side or I would feel Very light faint like the flutter of rapid butterfly wings.  I even started the fetal stress monitoring test and he didn't budge on bit even when they tried introducing sonic wave noises he was so lazy in the womb but he's more than made up for it now.

It will happen soon enough!|`|coTOLaukaa	don't worry about it, it may be you wont feel it until later, go to your doctor if you are really worried =)|`|AA10254927	I didnt feel mine until about 22weeks and now she wudnt stop moving!! :)<br>  Give it time. Dont panic. Ask ur doc if u still have apprehensions!|`|EgIHbCfRaa	I am thin and healthy and didnt feel my baby really move until about 24 weeks so your fine! It's dif for everyone! 8 )|`|MRTM8HCuaa	well you should be fine. go see a doc. if you are really worried
1z3C0R2Vaa	I don't thinks so...|`|QV5E70e6aa	No not at-ole. Seamen leads to the process of pregnancy's where as abortion is the process related to improper settlement of embryo in uterus.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	i would not think so, a missed abortion happens when something is not right with the child. or her body was fighting it off, because in actuality, a baby is a foreign object and our bodies fight things off that aren't supposed to be there.
jsoSKMEmaa	My ittle girl is 14 months old now and generally she just eats whatever we have for tea. Sometimes obviously there is some stuff i don't want her to have so I have to make her a different meal. I too am on a budget! Buy some baby pasta. It cooks in minutes and you can put any kind of sauce on it, cheese, add some veg or tuna. If you add peas & sweetcorn they can eat it all as finger foods!! Scrambled eggs are good, chiken nuggets & fish fingers are usually a real hit!! I don't give my little girl chips yet but i usually buy a bag of sweet potatoes and chop 1 or 2 up into thin chips, pop them in the oven with a tiny bit of olive oil on them (can add some herbs too if you like) and cook for 20 mins. Healthy chips!! She loves them. Also as you don't use many potatoes for 1 meal they ast ages and do quite a few meals. If you have some smaller potatoes you could jacket potatoe with cheese, tuna, beans - anything! <br>  By 1 year old they should be eating most things - just check the packaging of anything you buy for sugar, salt content etc.<br>  Hope this helps!!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I give my daughter fish fingers, fish cakes, home made wedges<br>  <br>  When my daughter turned 11 months I tried to give her what me and my partner had where possible, but chopped up. For example spaghetti bolognaise, lasagne, casserole. This was the stage where I introduced her to using a spoon and fork by herself too.|`|oiJITSNZaa	anything! though lots of fruits and vegetables with a sprinkling of meat. You can easily put things like you eat through a baby food grinder and ditto there's your baby food! That is as long as you yourself are eating healthy!|`|fZGBjtpVaa	My daughter loves fish fingers.  Before buying Birds Eye have a look at the salt level, then compare it to a cheaper brand. <br>  Mash potato is very good, goes with everything!  Healthy, and fills them up :)<br>  If there's like a farm store near you, or something similar you can get potatoes faily cheap.  There's one near me and you can get a massive sac which will last you atleast a month for ￡8.  <br>  Rice is also good, with peas, and bits of steamed chicken?  (steaming it makes it less dry, so more chance your toddler will eat it)<br>  And one thing you can't go wrong with.. Spaghetti!|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Beef or chicken casserole - serve with mashed potatoes and veggies. Freeze in small portions for her.  Baked beans and fish fingers are fine Scrambled eggs, anything on toast. make your own fishcakes - with tinned salmon and mash - she will love them!|`|68c6B8dRaa	Quiche is cheap and toddler-friendly, and you can cram all sorts of frozen veg in a quiche.|`|AA10077992	Iceland's meat ,fish and pasta are very good value at the moment. Their fruit , veg and dairy products are , too. <br>  Just give her what you're having but still use your blender when necessary and give her finger foods as well. - just check the salt content isn't too high|`|lC7oWudPaa	by developing their habit of eating ur meal (that is cooked everyday)|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Baby food doesn't have to be expensive, it can be quite cheap.  Just make sure you give her a balanced menu of proteins, vegetables and carbohydrates.  Make sure the food is not too much in "chunks" or that they are soft and easily dissolve in the mouth, or liquidise it a bit.  <br>  You could use the leftovers of a roast chicken or other meats cooked for yourself - in little "shreds" - or even use some lean ham or some seafood.  Add some deep frozen veg like spinach, broccoli, etc if you don't have fresh veg, but any veg will do, really.  Potatoes mash up very nicely, rice is easily digestible and she shouldn't choke on it, and spaghetti can be "mashed" with a fork so that they are not too long strands for her to cope with.  I used to give my children almost anything we were eating, mashed up if needed, e.g. spaghetti bolognese, roast chicken with veg and potatoes, spaghetti with soft boiled egg and some frozen spinach and peas thrown in.  You can also get frozen cod in portions and cook this with some onion, tomatoes (fresh, frozen or tinned), some other veg you have frozen or fresh like peas, sweetcorn, carrots etc. all cut fine and cooked until soft. <br>  You can make a larger quantity of meals for her and freeze the rest for another time.  <br>  It's not really difficult.  Just bear in mind you want to give her a balanced menu without too much saturated fats.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	My advice? Go to the local market at the end of the day to get some fresh veg. Cook it, mash or puree it then let it cool and freeze. If you have an ice cube try put equal amounts of the veg in the cubes. (local ￡1 shops should sell these) Also buy diced chicken breast, sometime you can get whoops dices chicken breast from Asda or at the local market. Separate the chicken into 2 dices and either freeze then in a bag or if they will fit in another ice cube tray. These will be quicker to defrost when you need to cook them and you can chop up the chicken. Ive given my girls birds eye fish fingers when they where little. Soft and easy for them to pick up should the spoon be dropped! (finger food) There have been some on offer at Asda for a while for ￡1 with omega 3 in. Don't go for the cheap brands as they are not fish they are mush in batter basically. 100% cod is what you need to look for. Iceland? Compare Asda frozen foods at the moment they are on offer.
Jcz29H2Oaa	uhhhg, me and my boyfriend are going through the same exact thing. he doesn't understand anything! i admit that i am very irritable and i get mad very easily, but he doesn't do anything to prevent it! we've been getting in fights a lot lately, and it feels like its getting to the point where i cant prevent them anymore. he gets so mad at me and starts saying im crazy, i have issues, im bi polar... and it really hurts me to know that he just doesn't understand. its not our fault! i just wish that he understood. as of right now, were not even talking... he said he wants nothing to do with me. so im in a pretty bad position right now, idk if were going to fix it or not. but if we do  he needs to grow up and start understanding things better. :[ but sweetie just know that its not your fault, nothing out of the ordinary is wrong with you. your pregnant, and he either needs to understand that or maybe you guys should have some time apart. he shouldn't be stressing you out when your pregnant.|`|3dxwK9v3aa	Men never understand it, even if they try, they will not truly understand it.

AA10186411	Because they don't want to be deemed "a crappy father".  My daughter's father has her name tattooed on his back, and goes around town talking about his beautiful daughter.  Yet he never comes to see her, doesn't pay support, does nothing.  He liked to "pretend" to be such a good daddy, and doesn't want anyone calling him a bad one.  Him signing his rights over would make him a "bad daddy"!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	most of the time its to be difficult and make things harder for mom.,....other times, mom wont  LET them around the kid and they do it hoping for a chance  one day....it seems like too many men use mom as an excuse for not seeing their child when she legally cant stop them. but if they  hand over their rights, they cant blame mom any more.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Because then if they go talk to someone else and they say yea I gave up all  my rights then it makes them look like a "loser". They don't want others to think that about themselves so they make us look like the bad guy.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Because in the back of his mind he thinks he will have a relationship with them one day. For some reason he doesn't want to deal with the mother so he just waits.|`|4FQKWxB9aa	That's a great question, I have no idea why they would care, but I know a guy who has 3 girls, One lives in another state so he never sees her & the other two live here in town,  He's not exactly the best dad, but his ex is a HUGE WITCH, and she won't let him take his girls on his own, he hasn't fought for custody, but i know he pays child suppoer & doesn't get to see them very much & in my mind is a bit of a dead beat dad.... But i have no doubt he loves his girls & if asked to give up his rights he would say HECK NO.<br>  <br>  Maybe they don't know how to be a dad & can't afford to pay the money, but they don't want to give up their child for good..... <br>  IDK either.... i'll never get it.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	I'm sitting here in tears, because I just found out that men signing over their parental rights is the LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS.<br>  <br>  Check this out: There is a Congress-witch from California named<br>  Barbara Boxer who wants the United States to sign a Treaty to turn<br>  over ALL OF OUR PARENTAL RIGHTS to the Child's Advocacy folks<br>  at the United Nations.<br>  Evidently the only two Nations who have not signed this treaty are the<br>  United States and Somalia.  I heard Boxer say "we don't want to<br>  be in the company of Somalia, now do we?".  Well, if it means we<br>  don't sign this Treaty, YES WE DO WANT TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF SOMALIA.  We sure as hell don't need to "be in the company of"<br>  Iran, Syria, North Korea, etc...<br>  Anyway, I'm writing this because you really have to read the nightmare that other Countries' parents are going through because they signed<br>  onto this Treaty.  I provided a link here, so PLEASE, PLEASE GO<br>  TO IT AND CHECK IT OUT.  When you are in tears or ready to get<br>  violent over the documented facts you read, please join the hundreds of thousands of other parents who are writing to Barbara Boxer, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and tell them NO WAY WILL WE AGREE<br>  TO THIS.  <br>  You will read how in Belgium if your one year old (or younger) child<br>  is found to have a disease or other condition, the State terminates<br>  the child.  Yep, you read that right: they literally kill the child.<br>  <br>  In the Netherlands,  you are the "caretaker" of your children and thats<br>  ALL.  You feed, clothe and shelter your children and that is your entire<br>  purpose. The "Committee" decides where he goes to school, what classes he takes, which ones he is allowed to opt-out of,  what religion he can subscribe to (if they decide to allow it) and if the child<br>  has there permission to be a specific religion, they also decide how<br>  many times he is allowed to participate in Church services or any other<br>  participation with the church;  if you want to move to a new house,<br>  you have to get the Committee's permission to do so.  You are not<br>  allowed to homeschool.  You are not allowed to give or keep away medicines or immunizations that the U.N. decides is best for the child.<br>  You are not allowed to punish the child in any way - you are not permitted to take away his cell phone, playstation, tv priviliges or<br>  ground him for any length of time.  All teenaged children get mandatory<br>  "leisure time", meaning that when they are not in school, you cannot<br>  require your children to do chores or contribute in any way to the family unit.  Even though you cannot discipline the child in any way<br>  at all, YOU ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE LEGALLY IF HE COMMITS<br>  A CRIME OR NEGLECTS TO SHOW UP FOR SCHOOL.  One father in Wales is in prison for the next 3 months because his son skipped school.  The father heard the kid talk about skipping school and so he<br>  figured he would nip that in the bud by grounding him; the child was<br>  mad for getting grounded so he told a teacher at school who reported<br>  it to the "Committee".  The father was visited and told that he was not<br>  allowed to ground the kid.  So naturally the boy knew his parents could not do anything to stop him, so he skipped school.  The parent<br>  is held responsible, and put into jail.  I guess he was just supposed to<br>  sit around and hope like hell that the kid would be nice and not get<br>  him jailed.<br>  An Italian woman didn't want her daughter to get an immunization because it had catastrophic affects when given to another family member, but her daughter was forced out of the home and given the<br>  immunization anyway.  Her daughter is in a coma.  The Committee<br>  told her she can have another child.  <br>  DO YOU SEE HOW BAD THIS IS?  My first thought was that our<br>  constitution would never allow us to sign this Treaty, but evidently<br>  if our elected officals decide to sign it, WE ARE STUCK WITH IT,<br>  AND EVEN IF ANOTHER PRESIDENT IS ELECTED, IT IS VERY HARD TO GET OUT OF A TREATY LIKE THIS ONE.<br>  <br>  Please go to this link, and please share this with as many friends<br>  and family members as you can.

Then you can never hold them accountable? Unless that's not the issue at all and you don't want to hold them accountable.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Signing over rights isn't as easy as you would think. Even if both parties agree to it, it can't be done unless the courts approve it- and they don't always approve it. And even though a father can sign the rights away doesn't mean he isn't still obligated to pay child support.

V780z5Pyaa	Donate them.<br>  Sell them on Ebay?<br>  <br>  But donating would probably be your best bet to do. Since it would be helping other people out that need them!|`|exPRWUgCaa	Donate them to Freecycle or dump them off into those donation boxes you find at shopping plaza parking lots. You could also put an ad in craigslist for any takers.<br>  <br>  Or you can just store them in your garage and maybe come up with an idea for using them in an art installation, lol.|`|4L6FFR3zaa	I think you should just throw it away. You may feel guilty doing that, but what else can you do? Just toss them.|`|zBz10IiOaa	how about craigs list hun?|`|4FQKWxB9aa	Give them away to someone who could use it, if you know anyone having a baby, you could ask, I don't mind gently used things, & if you don't know anyone take it to a second hand store,  I know how you feel, it's hard for me to throw things away like that :)
SEzIkGNiaa	I got this from my "What every babysitter should know" book:<br>  <br>  1. Leave them alone.  They can work it out themselves<br>  2. Seperate them<br>  3. Try to interest them in different/other activities<br>  4. Don't take sides<br>  5. Call the parents if they do not listen, or if things get worse.<br>  <br>  If kids can not work things out on their own, you may have to get involved.  Kids will eventually cool off if they're seperated.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well if you want them to stop fighting then you need to tell them to stop fighting. Whoever is fighting gets to go sit in there room the rest of the night or has to do the dishes or watch some really dumb show that kids wouldn't like. Like the history channel. ha that might work.|`|BwINH9jGaa	You shouldn't have laughed at the 10yo when he said 'she doesn't set a good example' YOU being the one in charge should be setting the good example. By not discipliningng and just 'playing' you are telling them that you do not care if they are fighting and you are probably making the 6yo hate you for laughing!<br>  <br>  From the way you talk, I have to think that you are most likely barely 16ish. <br>  <br>  When they fight, you TELL THEM TO STOP. Tell them there will be consequences and then follow through with the consequenceses. <br>  <br>  Put them in the corner, shut off the TV, tell their parents when they return.<br>  <br>   Don't do nothing.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	You really do not have much choice here. You never hit some ones child who is in your care. You must try to talk to the child, talk to the parent and ask them what they want you to do when the child acts out. A good sitter is in charge and does not just play in my opinion.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Separate the kids when they fight.|`|TuNEQLgkaa	Just give the older kid a slap... really :)
AaxIZSTwaa	I can definitely understand feeling that way. We've been trying to conceive since December '07, and this month I was the same way, just felt that this could finally be our month. Try to hang in there a bit though, cause I know how getting a negative result makes me feel, and i doubt any test could be positive now, even if you were pregnant. Good luck! I hope you are! Try to tough it out at least a couple more days. Some people get a positive at 8dpo.  Good luck!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I know it's easy 4 me to say but you have to be PATIENT.....Just remember good things come to those who wait....Find something to ocupy your mind, crosswords ect...

I always thought i couldn't get pregnant and my doc said that himself too! 2 weeks later after he said that, I found the big news..I WAS PREGNANT!!!! just when you're about to do the deed, dont run and tell your husband/mate that it is going 2 b today because you're putting 2 much stress on the poor guy....just have trust and know that a little sperm of his will do its job!!!

in6Iw3BEaa	I know how you feel, my husband's side of the family is procreating all over the place.  BCP babies, twins, oops babies.  It's really hard to deal with all that and my favorite way to do it is avoidance.... which doesn't really work.  Just remember, everyone else's pregnancy has nothing to do with you.  It seems unfair and unjust that it won't happen for you.  After 4 years, I'm having to slowly get used to the idea that it just might not be in the cards for me and that really really sucks.  But an advantage that you and I have is that not all hope is lost.  You've been trying for a little over a year.  You still have so many options.  It looks like your doctor is going for the most common treatment method available, meaning that right now there is no reason to think your situation is much worse than it is.  Even after my 4 years, there's still so many options that we haven't tried.  Don't give up hope and try to separate yourself from the pregnancies.  It's no one's right to be able to become pregnant and the most 'worthy' people in the world still can't conceive.  Infertility does not discriminate against age, race, socioeconomic status, level of education or morality.  Keep your chin up, I know what it's like when everyone seems to be getting pregnant.  It's still very early for you, you still have many other things you can try.|`|zjxr6fRsaa	Well, hope this cheers you up....my husband and i have been having unprotected sex for 7 yrs and i hadn't gotten pregnant,and i know how you feel TRUST ME it's very painful seeing other women have babies and which most of the times they can't afford to feed them or even worse they give them away or worst they have abortions or like that woman that had 8 babies even though it wasn't  a natural pregnancy now she has 14 kids and by the way she lives i don't think it's fair...and that's when i ask to myself why?! i'm 27 yrs old and i feel i'm missing something in my life 'a baby' but all i do is talk to god and say 'you're the only one that knows why'...the only difference with me is that i haven't seen a doctor (can't afford one)so, if i've survived in all these years you should do the same...and always think "there's always a reason for everything that happens"so, what if your sister-in-law have 3,4 or 5...don't be selffish just be happy that she can have babies,she's a mother and should be thankful that she's not going through what you're going through right now....and congratulate her is not her fault is it?i have friends that are mothers and i love their kids and i act normal well,they think i don't wanna get pregnant,because i don't want people to feel sorry for me even though i know that sooner or later they're gonna find out...but not right now...i'm just waiting that's my hope "time".......you're seeing a doctor and that's the first step when trying to conceive for a certain period of time...and from the bottom of my heart 'I WISH U THE BEST OF LUCK' and hope to hear from you soon, with that great news!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	I would congratulate her but also tell her why your upset|`|s8VY7uReaa	Hun relax. you must feeing awful i know..but let nature take its course. i know women who have managed to conceive after 7-10 years. keep visiting your doctor. ask them if there any other alternatives such as IVF.. they may take few eggs from you..get your husbands sperm..fertilize the egg and then try implant it into your womb. you can try that option. or you can also try and adopt.|`|xwZKouCIaa	aw im so sorry, i kow this is a sucky situation but yes you should congratulate her and let her kno as well that you are feeling a lil bit discouraged about ttc and that you are feeling xtra sensitive about seeing her once again pregnant. she really didn't do anyting worng by gettin pregnant so try to to jusde her because im pretty sure she did not get pregnant just to throw it in your face.. try not to let this put any tension on your relationship with your sister in law.. dont worry soon it will be your turn just think of it as your baby is going to be XTRA special becase he/she is making you wait soo long.. hope this helps..

It is terrifying to be different in a world that is not yet accepting of you.<br>  <br>  You have to find the support in yourself as well as in family (if they would be supportive) and friends.

During puberty you will have differant feelings which may confuse you. This is one of them. <br>  <br>  If you are turned on by a guy it doesn't mean you are gay either. It just means you have some mixed up feelings about men and relationships. <br>  <br>  Another cause for this is that someone in your life (could be a friend, parent, teacher) may be saying that you are gay. This often causes kids to grow up thinking that and trying to accept it when thats not true at all.<br>  <br>  You may have been neglected in a relationship with your father (not saying that you have been) and this could be the cause. You are looking for another male to fufill that. If that is the case I would suggest finding another older male you like and trust to help fill that void. <br>  <br>  Either way, I think you should tell this to a school counselor and/or someone you trust like your mom, dad, aunt, uncle, teacher, family friend etc. Even if you feel embarressed to help they are there to help and should give you the advice you need. <br>  <br>  Don't pay attention to people who ignore you or say that you are gay. They are wrong to do so. And don't pay attention to online tests either! By getting help now you can have a healthy, and happy relationship in the future with a girl. <br>  <br>  I believe that sex and relationships are a gift from God and should be treated with care and respect. God's plan is for one man and one wife to be united together forever. However, I do not believe that people who have these thoughts or even people that choose a gay life style are unloved by God. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped and God Bless! <br>  <br>  PS I don't mean to offend you or anyone else. Sorry if I did!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	You can't really rely on an internet test!<br>  <br>  Do you find boys and girls hot? Then you are bi so you can marry a woman and have kids.<br>  <br>  Do you find just boys hot? Then you are gay and nothing will change that. Society is far more accepting of gay men than you think, you will be able to grow up and have children (adopted or surrogate) one day.<br>  <br>  I hope whatever sexuality you are that you grow to accept it and feel comfortable with it.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	Try not to stress about it. The more you stress the more complicated this, and other things in your life will be. Just calm down for now and let it run its course. The hardest thing in life is trying to go against the grain of your own existence (meaning let who you are flow forward, its easier being yourself).<br>  You can be turned on and masturbate to whatever you want. You're normal. And since your pretty young you may not be fully mentally and physically developed yet (most people aren't until puberty ends) so that's a big reason why you may still be confused. <br>  Wait it out. Relax. Go with the flow. Good Luck.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	hun your really young right now, in fact your just now trying to find who you are as a person and where your place in this world is.

Bw1h5xAcaa	The sore throat should be checked out for sure, if you have strep or something you'll need to be treated. As for the moodiness, yes, it's normal at any point in the pregnancy to have dramatic mood swings. As long as you aren't feeling out of control or having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, then the mood flux isn't really reason to notify your doctor.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Because you are at your 40 week mark and you had irregular abdominal cramps last night along witdefinitelyd changes, I would definetly call your midwife and at least get checked out.  During pregnancy you are never out of the woods until you deliver a heathy baby. Good Luck|`|6qqUPXFtaa	When there is nothing that you want than getting pregnant and you are so excited about facing physical and psychological changes but there is always the risk of suffering a sudden depression attributed to hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  During pregnancy, you are vulnerable and your mood and emotions swing easily depending on the way you manage the meaning of being pregnant. Having a support system consisting of your spouse, your family and friends is a must, along with your doctor's advice.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it is possible to stay in touch with pregnancy support centers or get feedback from other pregnant women to relief your fears, but when it is not possible, just take in mind the following guidelines to understand depression and stop it before it causes you harm.<br>  <br>  First, before anything else look inside; ask yourself if you are prepared to become a mother. If you feel you are not, this could just be from the anxieties that exist with becoming a mother the very first time. Exploring your own family history will also let you understand the relation between you and your upcoming baby.<br>  <br>  Caring for yourself is a must during pregnancy and stress associated to depression can be swept away by just anticipating your needs during this wonderful stage of your life, including relationships and knowledge plus the shopping for the material things for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  Emotional support is important, your attitude does count but getting professional help along with your partner, friends and family support will make your pregnancy easy from an emotional approach.

Your father is feeling extremely helpless right now, especially knowing that you will continue to see your boyfriend and he can't do anything about it.<br>  <br>  You are 18 years old.  You are old enough to make your own decision.  You can give your baby to a family who needs children.  Will you be able to do that?  <br>  <br>  I have seen women who had abortions once upon a time and are now regretting their youthful decision.

Raising a child on your own is difficult and not fair to a child.

Your parents probably don't want the added responsibility of caring for you and an additional child right now.

There are many families waiting for a baby to adopt.  you will regret this decision for the rest of your life.  if you feel as if your dad has trapped you into having the abortion talk to your school counselor and he/she can give you advice on YOUR rights as a parent - given that you are pregnant you are technically a mother.  best of luck to you - i hope it all works out.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Have you spoken to a health professional about this?

I know how difficult it would be to oppose your father, but you would have support from your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  However, if this is actually your own decision and is what's best, good luck. =)|`|1UrMbDZHaa	how old are you? its your body and if your father can't respect that...then hes in the wrong. i recently got pregnant and in no way am i or my boyfriend are ready but i don't want to kill what we created. whether it was a "mistake" or not. there are so many programs that will help pay for it. there is medicaid that would pay ,for free, for your medical expenses. there is WIC that will pay for formula and milk and cereal and juice and all sorts of stuff. then there are government programs that would help with daycare. and depending on your state you can even get scholarships to help pay for college. its a rough road but you need to take responsibility. and tell your dad that. he might be upset that his little girl is pregnant. assure him that you are still the same daughter he has always had and you must make a big decision and you will need his level headed advice. tell him you love him and such and how you feel about your bf and how he makes you feel. i'm sure he will come to understand.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KpnX1zUpaa	depending on how old you are depends on all of this. i think that no matter how old you are it's still wroung. but i mean if you only like 12 years old then thats a little different. but i think if your old enough to have sex then you should be mature enough to give birth to your child WHO HAS FINGERNAILS and a HEARTBEAT, you could always give she/he up for adoption after you have the baby.|`|MPaFhjuHaa	NOOOO you will regret it later.<br>  you are going to kill an innocent soon to be child?<br>  because what your dad says or thinks i HONESTLY think your boyfrend will leave u for kiillling his child ive heard many stories like that.. when and if your child is born how is your father not going to be in love with his own grandchild??<br>  He's saying these things because he is very upset!<br>  well its your decision your choice but think about it <br>  YOU WOULDNT BE HERE IF YOUR MOM WOULD HAVE MADE THAT CHOICE....|`|hSMw8kujaa	i D0NT THiNK Y0U SH0ULD GET AN AB0RTi0N fiRST 0F ALL ;; iT DOESNT MATTER H0W 0LD Y0U ARE 0R ANYTHiNG, Y0U HAD SEX AND KNEW THERE C0ULD BE CONSiQUENCES, SO i THiNK Y0U SH0ULD HAVE iT, AND PLUS Y0UR B0YFRiEND WANTS Y0U T0 KEEP iT AND SAYS HE WiLL BE THERE F0R Y0U S0 Y0U SH0ULD jUST G0 0N THAT.

TODAY I WOULD OF BEEN 3 MONTHS PREGNANT BUT 2 WEEKS AGO I HAD A MISCARRIAGE YOU DONT KNOW HOW I WOULD OF LOVED TO HAVE THAT BABY AS YOUNG AS I AM I WOULD OF TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RAISING THAT KID.

6qCnpxrNaa	Tell him that you are sorry he cannot go to his game today because his little brother or sister is sick and can't go.  I am disturbed that you feel that six and a half years of age is old enough for him to take himself to the park and back.  He is too young to go with supervision. There should be a chaperon.  See if there is someone who you know and trust that is going to be there and wouldn't mind watching out for him and getting him back home to you.  Good Luck!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	He's only six, so I wouldn't let him go alone. Even if it's just around the corner, you never know what could happen in those few short blocks. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something happened. If I were you I would either A) take him and drop him off and go pick him up B) call another teammates parents and ask if they'd give him a ride or C) He'd just have to miss this game. I wouldn't get that 4 week old out in the cold if she's already getting sick...and I wouldn't let him walk alone. Better safe than sorry.|`|MtKmKDVlaa	Take him to the game with the 4 week old....tell his coach to drop him off....go home after dropping him off knowing an adult will safely bring him home. Give him a big hug and kiss for good luck!|`|SdVrwd6daa	i would go there drop him off go home and come back to pick him up after the game. around the corner or not it doesnt take ver long for something to happen. dont chance it.|`|0eCuL5zYaa	take him and ask another mother or coach to bring him home or call you when the game is over

diT2WFfCaa	It could be implantation bleeding, but unfortunately, it's too early for you to tell for sure.  <br>  <br>  If you want to take an at-home test, you will have to wait for about 14 days after sex, or until the day your period is due.  If you absolutely can't wait that long, call your doctors office or planned parenthood.  They can tell you how soon you can come in and take a blood test.|`|AA10186411	You may be experiencing implantation bleeding.  Just wait until its time for your normal period.  Then take a test.  If you start bleeding very heavily and/or experience a lot of pain, you should see a doctor.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	bleeding is not a sign of being pregnant. Wait a couple weeks and take a test. 4 days will show no sign of being pregnant.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	if you did get pregnant its just implantation bleeding. i had what i though was a normal period but it ended up i was actually pregnant during that time. which is wierd because it lasted a week and was normally heavy. anyways don't worry about it hurting the baby. you wont know if your pregnant until you take a test next month. THEN when your HCG levels hit at least 2400 you can get an ultrasound and you will know for sure how far along you are by the size of the embryo.|`|t0Y0f8M3aa	that does sound like implamation bleeding.. which means when the egg gets fertilized it attatches to the wall of your vagina which sometimes can make women bleed! the only difference between ur period and im. bleeding is.. that im.. bleeding is like a pinkish/brownish color & you dont bleed very much & it can only last for about 2 days at the most!.. i hope i helped and if u wanted to be preg.. I wish u the best.. I have been trying 2 yrs and still no luck
heC9aQ18aa	I like Tristan spelled that way, Tristin spelled that way just does not appeal to me. Micah is a nice middle name and they go fine together but not as good as some other middle name would. I would spell Tristan this way but the kid is not mine so not up to me. Call him whatever you like and spell it as you wish.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I babysit a boy named Micah. That's a biblical name. I don't like Tristin.|`|zXcaTKqRaa	i adore micah, but can't stand tristin.<br>  too overused.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I really love Tristan.|`|vAF4wgVDaa	I like Micah better than Tristin.<br>  <br>  How about Micah Tristin|`|7uznrLBXaa	I really like the name Tristan.  But I think Tristin Micah together sounds too feminine.  How about Michael instead?|`|UJHKyg7kaa	how is the middle pronounced? Micaww or Mi-k-eye????????????????????<br>  <br>  <br>  Tristan is cute though<br>  <br>  IN is usually for gurls tho|`|tkQq5tR1aa	It's a cool name for a boy.|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Love it!

6qCnpxrNaa	Yes, I played around with it (for fun) in my first trimester and was told I was having a boy and sure enough, two weeks ago I had a son!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I tried it just for fun.  It said I was going to have a girl, I had a boy.  Go ahead and do it for fun, but definitely don't take it seriously.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	i used it and it said i was going to have a boy...i had twin girls! LOL!|`|ANnPZWm2aa	it was right for me, said i was having a boy and i did, said my mum was going to have a girl, and she did|`|vl0HWTDJaa	I'd guess it's been right for 50% of people|`|AA11510511	3 of mine have never been right.|`|62vCoDPjaa	mine was right about having a girl|`|kY29gYhjaa	i used it, it said i was going to have a boy and i did! i have also used for friends and it was right for them too. i even tested it with the children i already had (2 girls) and that was right too!|`|ee5MawLdaa	That stuff is bull. . . the chances are 50 50 so what the heck. That calculater. . . i heard is a myth|`|vLWs9Gbsaa	My sister swears by it, she has done it for her 2, my little one and every blooming friend that was pregnant! They all turned out correct, but I guess it is jut 50/50 really!|`|83j1ThU7aa	did it cause it was fun.. we were surprised at the sex and it said a girl and i have a handsome 5month old boy|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	Mine was wrong it said I would have a girl but I have a boy|`|X2eVfKc6aa	Ive only ever heard people say good things about it, it worked for me.|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	mine was spot on! but i guess its just a coincidence <br>  x|`|ORpbq3bAaa	it was true for me. every one has a 50/50 chance|`|y7of9NY7aa	I used it and it was predicted I was going to have a girl.  I was so happy because that was what I wanted.  I have a sleeping one month old little boy in his crib.  lol.|`|p2gMf7JIaa	Yes, and it was sooooooooooooooo right! It said i would have a boy, and sure enough, i did! it worked for everyone else i talked to about it!|`|h7i9Ngu9aa	mine said it was gonna be a boy and im a mother to a gorgeous 2 month old girl!! lol|`|gokbhnhhaa	For some people it works but for some it doesn't. So it really depends on the person.
tkQq5tR1aa	Why not give them two middle names? <br>  <br>  Brooklyn Elizabeth Renee (Last Name)<br>  Aiden Christopher James (Last Name)<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  You can use part of both names and create new names.<br>  <br>  Brooklyn Elizanee (el-iz-uh-nay) (Last Name)<br>  Brooklyn Reneabeth (reh-nay-uh-beth) (Last Name)<br>  <br>  Aiden Christames (Chris-stems) (Last Name)<br>  Aiden Jatopher (jay-tuh-fur) (Last Name)|`|LQetTtM9aa	I'm not usually a big fan of two middle names, but after reading your question, I said the names out loud, and think that the following works well:<br>  <br>  Brooklyn Elizabeth Renee<br>  Aiden Christopher James<br>  <br>  This way, both of you can have the names you want, and I don't think that either of these names sound bad w/ two middle names.  If you don't want to do this, one of you should pick the middle name for the girl, and let the other one pick the middle name for the boy, so that way each of you still gets to have one choice used.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped :-)|`|d5ug5W5kaa	have u pick one and him pick another|`|u94HOVz7aa	when i was naming my children my mother always said remember that if they have a long first name try to go with a shorter middle name and if its a shorter first name you can go with a longer middle name.  This way it evens out and your child doesn't have a really long full name or a really short full name. but ignoring what she said i like the how it sounds out loud the names:<br>  <br>  Brooklyn Renee<br>  &<br>  Aiden Christopher<br>  <br>  they sound beautiful to me|`|6yD5k9Azaa	I don't like any of your names to be honest(besides elizabeth/elisbeth and james). but...<br>  Brooklyn Elisbeth is much better than Brooklyn Renae<br>  Aiden James is much better than Aiden christopher<br>  <br>  Elisbeth Renae and Christopher James are much better names|`|lPvySEtsaa	renee and james<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226154357AAUFvb4&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  answer mine^|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Girl- Brooklyn Renee<br>  <br>  Boy- Aiden James|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	Brooklyn Renee<br>  Elizabeth Renee<br>  Brooklyn Elizabeth Renee<br>  <br>  Aiden James<br>  Aiden Christopher<br>  James Christopher<br>  Aiden James Christopher|`|uGxWOIOdaa	I like Renee & Christopher - and hey, you both win.

Z8Ui1ugLaa	Your post par tum can take a little longer.  Count your days from when you stopped bleeding from the D&C.  This is when your HCG levels should have started to drop to zero.  You could get your period 4 -8 weeks from the time your HCG levels dropped.  If you don't get it 12 weeks from that time, you should contact your doctor just to see if there isn't any scar tissue from the D&C.  Good Luck|`|FYDw1rjlaa	It depends because everyone is different. It could takes weeks or even months to get your period normally again after birth. My first child, it took me 3 months and my second took me just a month.|`|kvAeV9GYaa	Everyone is different.  If you are breast feeding it might come later then you think.
MXXOICquaa	its from your belly growing, as you get bigger you get growing pains from the stretching of muscels and ligaments|`|FLOjzbKEaa	it is as your docotr said.|`|AA10186411	Sounds like Braxton Hicks contractions.  They are just false labor, trying to get your uterus ready.  They are not strong enough to cause dilation.  Your baby is getting bigger, thats why its heavy and sore.|`|T48smu01aa	Yep I started around then too I was worried as well but was told they were braxton hicks and it felt like every time i got would I had to be ha ha it was SO weird.....I get them a lot but i guess its normal :) If everything checked out fine you are probably fine....unless you are having tons of pressure diarrhea back pain then you should be worried....but it sounds totally normal to me!<br>  <br>  Wow good thing I know how to type haha i meant to say every time i get the braxton hicks i feel like I have to pee its quite funny!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Probably Braxton Hicks contractions, which are totally normal. As long as you aren't having this happen more than 6 times per hour, it's fine.|`|v3LnJycKaa	Braxton hicks.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Sounds like Braxton Hicks contractions. They are normal. Your uterus is "practicing" for labor. During these your uterus will tighten or feel hard.  I do feel like I have to pee when I have them. Sometimes I will start having them if my bladder is too full. Most of the time they are not painful, just sometimes a little uncomfortable. The further you get, they may become a little more painful. Contractions can also be your body saying "hey..give me some water" So make sure you are staying hydrated. Dehydration is a common cause of uterine contractions. As long as they are not painful, not regular and you are not having more than 5-7 an hour, then it is ok. It is just your body getting ready. If they do become regular, drink 2 big glasses of water and lie down. See if they go away. If they become more intense or stay regular, then you should call your Dr.<br>  <br>  Whoever is giving the thumbs down, obviously knows nothing about pregnancy..lol. The fact that we all pretty much have the same answer here should tell you we know what we are taking about.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It's the weight of your ever growing bun in the oven pushing onto your bladder, pelvis, everything down there. The pressure will only increase, especially when the baby starts dropping in late third trimester and as he/she keeps growing. If your doctor is not concerned, you shouldn't be either. You might want to invest in a pregnancy belt, to help support your heavy abdomen. It will help relieve some of the pain.|`|GLOBmh0Baa	We can't diagnose. It does sound like Braxton Hicks, but better to go back to make sure. You should have asked your doctor more questions. If you are still concerned, just go back to the doctor and ask for more information. If she wasn't worried about it, you shouldn't worry. She is a proffessional so she would know if it was anything to worry about.. it will just make it worse if you worry.<br>  <br>  look here for more info: <br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/antenatalhealth/physicalhealth/braxtonhicks/?_requestid=5139337" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/an...</a>|`|9U5GV6xmaa	It sounds like Braxton Hicks, which are slight contractions. I would take some rest. Also if you start spotting, see a Doctor fast. I had that for a month, and my son was born a month later. Keep your Doctor informed, go to your regular visits, but if you start to bleed, go to the hospital. Thanks. Good luck, and congratualtions.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Im surprised your doctor didnt explain braxton hicks contractions to you. Their not real contractions just practice for the real thing.
