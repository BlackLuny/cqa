P7rhbdf6aa	Why not try a wash cloth? I use those when I use my Nadds.
sJQdS66Paa	It sounds like the band size is too big, so you might need different bras.  You can also try hooking your current bra on the tightest hook.|`|AA11100368	it sounds like the straps are too short, the best piece of advice was that you go get yourself measured.  Its like any peice of clothing, if it dont fit right it wont work right|`|zuFJmLhgaa	It sounds as if its too small, go to your local department store and they will measure you correctly..|`|XkWTsyJdaa	ur bra is too big, its not tight enuf and staying in place.|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	your bra is too big for you you should get measured<br>  <br>  myfirstbra.us
eIm595O2aa	Whenever I use a curling iron or a flat iron on clients, I use a thermal spray. My favorite is Kenra Thermal Styling Spray. It has a really good hold. You section your hair out, and before you use the iron you spray it on. Initially it feels sticky and wet like hairspray, but once the heat hits it, you hair will be really soft. This stuff has 2 perks.... One is that it holds the curl better, and the other is that it actually protects your hair from the heat! Just make sure you don't over-saturate your hair with it. All you need is a good mist.|`|A96W1WVCaa	I don't know how often you like your hair curly, but why don't you just get a perm to make it curly? I know that if you have a perm, mousse helps it stay in and a pick. but I'm sorry, not so sure about hair spray... just thought i'd give a suggestion

cXQmtN1Saa	Wellll I own a few mineral eyeshadows and I've never actually noticed any difference in the staying power of them &other eyeshadows (but that might just be bc I always use a primer). Oh and putting water/visine with the eyeshadow makes it turn from a powder to a cream so the color comes up MUCH bolder when you apply it.<br>  <br>  hope I helped someee. :]
hraNSxbpaa	i have the same problem...lol even in the summer. i like Dove Cream Oil intensive body lotion. it works soooo unbelievably well! i love it...and it smells really nice to. a lot of lotions you have to put it on a few times a week before you notice a difference, but i put this on once a day, and it is already ten times better!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  =) good luck|`|HIwJFtNlaa	Best time to lotion is right after your shower, after you've dried off you should lotion. <br>  Aveeno is a great lotion so is St. Ives and My brother uses Cetaphil.<br>  All purchasable from drug stores. <br>  (: good luckk!|`|HQFUnslhaa	Try Nivea body. That works every time. Or the other thing I do is when I come out of the shower I put some baby oil on my legs, let it soak in and wipe off with a towel. My legs end up looking baby soft after that.|`|HHL01vDAaa	Try baby oil<br>   rub it in<br>  Then wipe the ecess off<br>  And then rub in some lubriderm

FQNfXgvFaa	well it depend if its your style, it dosent matter if you are skinny or not because they make sizes..i think it would not look bad at all..|`|XtjCIWUcaa	yes, they can.<br>  my brother orders their clothes offline all the time and he's pretty skinny.<br>  he looks fantastic in them so i'm sure you would too.|`|Avx0FmX0aa	Of course! You could totally pull it off.|`|gzWwwsg0aa	yeah you could do it|`|Top5YzaVaa	go for it|`|0vo7tDP5aa	well it would look better on a skinny person than a big fata.ss. I'm pretty skinny too and there's not much i can't pull off.  <br>  <br>  that reminds me of a funny time, i went in there a long time ago. they're sooo pushy and this gay salesman was following me around. and recommended this black t-shirt. so i tried it on. it was SO tight. i looked like a tool. then i came out, and my cousin just started busting up. the salesman thought it looked good. but i think he just wanted commission.
oxL8MEKPaa	No it does't work. Nothing does. It's all a lie. Sorry, but  it's true. Celebrities get paid $$$$ to endorse products. But they don't really use them. Don't waste your money.<br>  The stretch marks will get better a little in time. <br>  I know from experience.|`|3ndqP2Haaa	I used to have pretty bad stretch marks and red scars around my belly region ever since I gave birth to my three kids.I had tried Vitamin E oil and cocoa butter which a number of people had recommended but unfortunately it didn't seem to work too well. My Doctor had even suggested that I go for a Tummy Tuck. I then recently read an article about a lady who supposedly got rid of her stretch marks using a particular cream. I tried it and it worked really well. It took a number of weeks but my stretch marks soon faded away. You can read the lady's article at this site.

Dont just take my, or anyones opinion. If the guy ur chillin with thinks its ok for him and is confident, u should support him in it.. its really all about the personality of the guy..<br>  <br>                            good luck:),<br>                           HDR<3|`|hqfE3mpoaa	if you are going to wear those colors, you have to be confident and not be all freakish about it. like they say, tough guys wear pink. anyone can wear whatever color. who cares, just be yourself and don't do anything just to fit in.|`|42DvP1AEaa	I think its cute. If its all the time it might be a little weird. But one shirt or multiple shirts with baby blue or pink accents is very cute! If the shirts not tight then you will defiantly look confident enough to be comfortable with girly colors = )|`|DYWytJCJaa	i think its cool if they wear those colors.<br>  it just means they like those colors and theyre comfortable wearing them.<br>  i dont really believe in "girly" and "boyish" colors. <br>  its pretty pointless.<br>  colors are colors.|`|eTS2nd70aa	I don't see anything wrong with it, so long as it's not a girl shirt (lace, frills, whatever).

d10UVsgsaa	no, spend the money on your dress, and wait for high school graduation.|`|5AwuNcn1aa	I don't think it is necessary but if you want to it's your special day. Don't feel peer pressured by your friends. You could go through magazines and find a hair style you like and ask a family member to style your hair for you! You can do your own nails by giving yourself a manicure by soaking your hands, pushing your cuticles back, choosing a nice neutral shade (these colors are less noticeable if you make a small error), applying two coats, wait until they are completely dry and apply a clear top coat. If you do these things your nails will look like you had them done professionally. Nobody will know you did them yourself. Do this the night before you graduate so you go to bed with that pampered princess feeling! Another good option is to find a beauty school in your area. They can do any style you find and are MUCH cheaper. There is always a supervisor working in case a problem arises. They need the experience and are  more then willing to do updo's. My hairdresser friends say that updo's are their favorite things to do because they can be creative and fun. Most beauty schools have nail technicians in training. You could get your hair and nails done at a beauty school for under $30 including tip compared to $25 for nails, and $30-$40 for a trip to the hair salon. If you are more comfortable doing your hair and nail yourself then by all means do it yourself. Just follow your instincts and don't feel pressured by your friends!|`|iHna2K7Gaa	It's not necessary at all. I didn't even get my hair or nails done for my high school graduation. It's not like people can see it anyway, and even if they did no one would really care. It's just going to be your classmates' families in the audience, and they aren't there to judge you, they're there to see their kids. I'm not saying you should look frumpy or anything, but my suggestion would be to just do it all yourself and save money. Just buy a light or sheer-colored nail polish and do it yourself, and you can straighten or curl your hair with a straightening iron or curling iron if you have one.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and congratulations. Good luck with high school, and best wishes. :)|`|26909f3cf9dce61ce4f4f5edc5c0e6baaa	I know I did because it was a special day, Its a one time only, and you gonna take alot of pictures so you do wanna look nice.

I'm going 2 graduate from year 8 this year 2. i'm just doing my own hair, no need to go 2 a hairdresser, and buying a bottle of nail polish instead of getting them done professionally, but i guess the choice is yours.|`|Eog7lFpGaa	I think 8th grade is a little excessive. I mean, you can if you want, just don't spend tons of money on it.<br>  For my high school graduation I didn't even anything like that, nor did anyone else I graduated with.<br>  Not saying it's bad to, just not necessary.|`|gKQDNpS3aa	it's not necessary at all! my mom wanted to treat me to a manicure for a little graduation present, so i did, but the majority of my friends didn't do anything!|`|6qljYOO2aa	I did. =\<br>  <br>  It really depends on what type of person you are...<br>  It'll make you look nice! Like if you have relatives or family you don't see so often coming, like I did, it makes a nice impression.

wNa0H5rmaa	Since your wearing jeans and a nice top u should go with heels. <br>  black would look good.<br>  and it depends on how low cut the top is. <br>  if it is low enough that you can wear a neclace with it without it going over the top itself then wear it!<br>  also silver hoops would look good.<br>  tinier ones not huge ones!<br>  <br>  This way you will look nicer especially because of the heels and you still won't be over the top dressed up!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|XuFmnqSpaa	You should either wear like cute black ballet flats, or even some black heels would look nice since it is semi-formal.

hmzMd5TLaa	Biggest turn-off ever. We have a guy in the grade below us that smells. He doesn't bathe. Deodorant and cologne help.|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	Umm try some axe or something. And somewhere around 4th spray it on again in the bathroom. What kind of smell is it? Like B.O. or what?|`|GrarZDDwaa	Yea, no one wants to be seen with or date the smelly kid. Just uh use soap|`|MbFS6XFQaa	One of my crushes way back was in basket ball, so he smelled like B.O a lot lol. I still liked him, though.<br>  <br>  It's kinda rugged, I guess. But everyday of like, bad smells is a major turn-off|`|1QpigqCNaa	YESSS!<br>  <br>  i think that is the most disgusting ever<br>  my boyfriend always carries this little mini travel size axe spray... get one right now:)|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	BIG turn off.<br>  its disguisting.<br>  no girl wants to be around that.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	yes it is..<br>  my boyfriend never smells.|`|sObIHn4caa	Yeah, it is. And it's even worse when the guy tries to mask it with cologne! Just experiment with different deodorants till you find the right one. It's okay, I think every one has a problem with that. I used to for a long time and it was so annoying. So I just tried about ever brand out there until I found one that really works.|`|bUATSZsaaa	Not a huge turnoff. Most girls understand that guys have worse B.O. than girls, and realize they can't help it. I personally don't judge guys for B.O., as long as they aren't like letting one rip you know? haha that's just nasty.|`|0AkFH1M2aa	OF course thats gross<br>  <br>  how old do i look?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220194607AATAIaA&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OPsssOI2aa	huge turn off.<br>  just carry mini bottles of axe everywhere you go.<br>  and travel sized deodorant helps.|`|WogCQicOaa	OH YEAH!!! but its also a huge turnoff if it smells like you bathed in AXE.|`|sVdST6nVaa	HUGE turnoff|`|HJbZHS2uaa	Well if your dating eachother does it really matter, its not like you sometimes dont smell? whats the point|`|es3feuhxaa	its a turn off <br>  wear some good smelling but not too strong cologne.|`|e8ee53810406b4bfc80c42a6743042e0aa	It is one of the BIGGEST turn-offs. I don't want to crush your self-confidence, but smelling bad is kind of  a deal-breaker for most women. If bathing every morning just isn't doing the trick (which is normal for most school-aged guys and older guys too), try some heavy duty deodorant (make sure it says "anti-perspirent" or it won't prevent the smelly sweat from happening). Also, make sure you wear clean socks. Put on a splash (not too much because that won't be good either) of cologne or body-spray. Try taking a duplicate shirt to school and changing if you notice an odor late in the day. Good Luck. Oh yeah, there is a condition called 'primary trimethylaminuria' that can cause people to smell worse than they would normally. You VERY likely do not have it, but it is an interesting read ;).|`|pKe48uoDaa	haha yeah it really is! we girls (well most of us..) have low tolerance for smells like that! but if you already  have a girlfriend she should be understanding..<br>  A little D.O goes a long way, like axe or tag, and to me those smell really good! <br>  smelling good like that is a major turn on! plus i think i read somewhere that smells affect the mood your in (something to do with chemicals in the brain) so certain smells can make you feel a certain way..<br>  so if you smell bad, I guess it makes you and everyone Else feel bad.. not sure on that one though!|`|HaNOmXaEaa	Smelling bad is my biggest turn off in the beginning, but after I'm with a guy for a while it kind of stops mattering, and there's even moments when he's been working out for a few hours that I get really turned on and animalistic. Idk why that is, it just is.|`|nI18avGuaa	its is so attractive if i guy smells good. so smelling bad is a big turn off personally. if he is hot and has a good personallity then i guess its a little bit better but keep colone in your locker or somethin.|`|UzFWLTquaa	Yes, if a girl is close to a guy (literally) and if I was her it would be hard to concentrate on anything but the smell.  So yes its a pretty big turn off.|`|HX4B4Rtvaa	i smell all natural i havent showered in over a year and the ladies are lovin it cause i got such game.  i dont shave or get my haircut either cause im such a pimp.  chyeah boiiiiii|`|eON9Ffhjaa	it is a big turn off.... i normally remember my guys by how they smell and i think of that wen i think of them, so bad small reminds me of bad memories with the guy.|`|CQESMsV8aa	For me, that is the biggest turnoff ever!!! And for a guy to smell good (not necessarily with a lot of cologne) is a huge turn on.|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	yahh it kinda is sorry to dissappoint youu =/ lol but as long as you carry around some cologne or something you could just spray it wheneverr and make sure you have gum because bad breath is even worse! hope i could help ;)|`|w4l8NajJaa	its a turn off to me and im a guy lol<br>  if i smell like bo then i freakk lol<br>  but i havnt since a long time<br>  im well prepared<br>  just put deodarant after you shower|`|AA11411316	HUGE. <br>  <br>  On the other hand if a guy smells really good, it is a HUGE turn on. :)|`|AA10208246	Yeah. If I guy smells bad then its nasty. When I hug a guy I want smell cologne or laundry detergent not must and  funk.|`|9eQD1Yk9aa	yes, bring cologne and deodorant.|`|7DG99jUnaa	lets get real any one who smell bad you would nut want to be around would you|`|ArFFUPTBaa	Yes we get turned off by a smelly guy.<br>  its just gross. =(|`|psPgWF0gaa	that's probably the biggest turn off.|`|w7rtDlaDaa	YES|`|Ac8Fzcliaa	ew, like majoorrr turn off.|`|hGUYTMGRaa	yeah it is a turn off
D2bmAJfxaa	I'm now 17. And I started shaving in my mid 16. So just give in another year. It's not like you're going to get a serious relationship in 15 right. So, don't think about what others think. Give it a year and then start shaving. There's no particular reason for it. But let me tell you one thing, facial hair is not a bad thing it supports your skin. And about that moustache thing. let it be as it is. Listen to your mom bro.|`|9alw0BY7aa	im 12, i take my dad razor's coz i dont have my own, i have a slinght mono to but pluck it or ewww|`|nxH8Asxgaa	If you want to look normal, remove the uni brow.

Shave it.  You're not a little boy any more.  Buy a rotary electric razor, so you won't have to mess with shaving cream and razor blades.<br>  <br>  A uni-brow is not too bad for a guy, but you can pluck it little by little so no one notices what you've been doing.  You'll have to keep after the little short hairs as they grow back in.  After a few months they may stop growing in, so don't get too drastic with your plucking.|`|1OEDcz6Raa	do not mess with your eyebrows. you will just mess them up. have a talk with your mom and tell her that you want to get them waxed. or go to the mall- and go to a beauty store and have it done yourself. and talk to your mom about shaving|`|IWGSD34Oaa	i say shave it<br>  cause im 15 year old girl<br>  and i think its nasty when guys my age have facial hair<br>  but i think its really hot when older guys have it..<br>  and please wax your brows<br>  thats just everyone in general<br>  :]|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	i was 11 when i started.

aoVCM1uhaa	I used to have relatively bad acne. I tried a whole ton of cleansers, scrubs, creams, astringents. It didn't really help, and I have sensitive skin which made things worse. In the end I dropped all the more harsh soaps. I now use an Aveeno foaming cleanser for redness in the morning, and Clearasil wash at night. My face became less irritated and soon cleared up. I still have breakouts sometimes, probably due to stress, but they are way more infrequent now. :)<br>  <br>  Also, drinking more water and exercising more regularly has helped me a lot. =)|`|I7a9vimkaa	you can try and use moist heat such as a wet towel or steam from a really hot shower to bring them out faster then you can pop them and they will go away.|`|S1bUkpZ8aa	go to your regular doctor or dermatologist if you have one and ask for some prescription acne stuff..it works soo much better than proactive or any over the counter stuff|`|NHE3Jb8daa	Getting your skin better will more than likely not be cheap. <br>  <br>  TO TRY:<br>  I don't know what the sitch is with where YOU live, <br>  But here in New Zealand we have non-profit youth organizations <br>  which provide everything from sexual health, phsycological health <br>  to SKIN CARE.<br>  Ring around and see if any youth organizations over there can<br>  help you with your skin.

If you break out during your periods it sounds like yours is hormonal too. Also he did give me Differin topical lotion for night time, and Duac topical gel to wear under my makeup during the day.

It really makes my skin feel great.|`|uP9SQhkcaa	First of all, forget the medicines and treatments, kay? They aren't working for you. I really don't think they ever will. I think your acne is stress related. Try not to get so worked up and stuff. And when you are, don't touch your face. A lot of people do that when they are stressed out, and that may also have a lot to do with it. The more you touch your face, the greasier it gets, and that sounds like it plays the biggest part in your acne. Okay? Oh, and wash your face often. If you forget or are lazy about it, your acne will come back. And you don't want that. <br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Alice Danielle

5M8jzNBVaa	Don't put on makeup, it will just make your face worse, on top of the damage that you already have, then you will have to result to makeup for the rest of your life. Wash your face twice daily, with a mild soap (like dove) withprescription.. not a wash cloth because it strips the oils from your skin. Go to the dermatologist and let them evaluate your face and give you a prescription for something for your skin. About your lip, go to the drug store and buy a hair bleacher. Bleach your upper lip so that it won't be dark anymore. Lastly, go to the hair salon, tell them the problem with you hair, and get a funky little style.<br>  <br>  You need to build your self esteem up. You can't go around calling yourself ugly, if you're unhappy with your imperfections, change them! Try my suggestions, I think it'll help you out for the better ;)|`|JPfraSk9aa	You are not ugly you are just like a good car that needs a tune up and a wax job.<br>  They have contacts instead of glasses now and they are even disposable.  If you find them to expensive ask for them as presents for Christmas, Easter and your Birthday.<br>  There are so many make up kits to help all areas of the face.  Just watch QVC for some ideas and Janet Lightner use to have a wonderful kit for everything that you can even buy at the drug stores now,but I forget the name of it.  The kit can take care of the mustache, too.  Remember, no shaving your face.  And when you are all done with the make over only your very good hairdreser who is only only needed about every 8 weeks will know that that is really you and not one of those poor kids in foreign countries that are born with hairlips.  Always be thankful in all things.<br>  It might take awhile to save up to get all this done but then it's just maintenance and sometimes beauty schools give nice treatments for reasonable prices.  You just have to get out of your rut and get going.<br>  Here she comes - you never know.<br>  God Bless the new you because he already knows what you are going to look like.  And, maybe after learning all this you could help those less fortunate.  How do you think Snow White felt after she ate that apple?

They aren't that expensive. Black heads-- don't touch your face and wash it lots. Your face isn't toned... MAKEUP. Above your lips it is darker... Is it hair above your lip? If it is, get it waxed or something. if it isn't-- makeup. Again. (: Your hair-- cut it or something. (: You can make short hair look really cute!!! And what do you mean by treatments?? Treatments for what?|`|dPKkjK8iaa	First for the black heads- if you have spare money go to a local dermatologist... he will give you the best thing to take care of them... if not... the neotrogena wave is awesome... i think that it is like 13 dollars and it worked really good for my sis...<br>  For the upper lip thing- ummm i dont really know like a specific name but it is a bleach for the upper lip... it turns the hairs blonde to war you can't see them... alot of people use it that are girls...<br>  for the hair- go get it cut... get it evened up ( but dont try to do it yourself) <br>  Just dont worry so much...dont think that you are ugly because you are not... do things that will make you feel more confident.... like pluck your eye brows... paint you nails hot pink.... bleach your teeth... get some new make up... whatever makes you feel better about you :) good luck :)|`|ZXByVqf7aa	OK forget all the haters making fun of you. And for the glasses get contacts. For the blackheads....dont drink soda, drink water and clean your face with noxzema. Go to the beauty shop and you ends cut. NEVER PUT MAKE UP ON!!! It will only make your skin worse because it will irritate the skin. And for you lips go to MAC for some lighter lip gloss. Yeah its expensive but its worth it. So good luck without everything and im pretty sure your not ugly :)|`|zcbvIbRjaa	well.........um you can use brakeout stuff or buy that skin breakout stuff candace cameron wore. if u have glasses u can wear contacts. it's ok i dont like how i look at times too.|`|MHCXm6iRaa	get a haircut and wax ur eyebrows(i swear it doesnt hurt) and use face wash every day and concealer is MY hero.....I think you would be fine;)|`|G3RnxAyyaa	You should wear some makeup to even out the uneven skin tone.<br>  <br>  Use SkinCeuticals blemish control gel.

Since you have a lot of blackheads water will help clear up your skin. [drink 8 glasses a day]<br>  You can try getting contacts or get glasses that frame your face better. I think that you might have some darker hairs up on your lips. I would either get it waxed or shave it off. Also wear foundation for your skintone to be more even. [ i would suggest mixing it with a light lotion] i would use either a power-liquid or a liquid foundation for you, since you seem to not have oil-y skin.<br>  <br>  for your hair i would go into a hair cutting place and ask for them to help you with it. or if you give us your face shape im sure we can help you further with that|`|KuJXcGZTaa	A picture might be helpful, but- calm down!

24cUKZDgaa	aeropostale, its more laid back.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	I like Aeropostale. It's cheaper and has cute clothes. :) Plus, not two shirts look the same. And there's more than just four color choices for every piece of clothing.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	Abercrombie. Aeropostale is too plain for me.|`|AX13vUJeaa	abercrombie.|`|R0S8vknaaa	I don't really think they are the same Aeropostale is for like kids who are just starting to get in style.  Abercrombie sticks to the normal stuff thats been in style or what they see stars wearing; Aero on the other hand is a little bit more edgy sometimes they nail upcoming styles right on the head but other times there a little bit off.|`|aPxmZq00aa	Neither. You're just helping somebody get richer by advertising for them on their cheap stuff which is probably made in some South Asian sweatshop anyway. People are smucks for wearing some slogan name on their clothes to impress other people how much they paid to make the other guy richer and you poorer.|`|46oOn3yeaa	ive never like areopostal, its just an abercrombie wanna be, however i don't like abercrombie anymore, it bores me. but abercrombie is still better.|`|vfrYYjusaa	i like aeropostale better i think abercrombie is way tooooooo expensive and kinda slutty, Hollister is wayy better :)|`|0MCIzWRmaa	abercrombie !<br>  even though it's more expensive than aeropostale, the quality is WAY better so it's worth it :)|`|y5LzVy2Waa	abercrombie definitely.  i feel like aero is an imitation of the clothes at abercrombie.|`|BgQvmZYzaa	well there the younger kid stores, i like A&F and hollister tho.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I like American Eagle over those two, honestly.|`|eGA9eCAiaa	Abercrombie for suuuure(:|`|AA12130734	aeropostale|`|3btLY1QCaa	aeropostale:) their stuffs A LOT cheaper and still just as cute|`|bb2SJvpSaa	hollister|`|uwg62QBAaa	aeropostale.<br>  <br>  abercrombie is ok not really a big fan of theirs.<br>  <br>  i like hollister better than both though!!|`|QcZpWf44aa	Aeropostale
7VjhcEk8aa	You need to do both 1 and 3.  You want this to appear natural so only apply small amount.  Just enough to make a difference.   <br>  <br>  <br>  1st: Apply a foundation about 2 shades darker then your skin tone along side both sides of your nose and under base of your nose.<br>    <br>  2nd: Draw a skinny line down the middle of your nose and blend in with foundation.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Wash your face with a gentle facial cleanser. If you are already wearing makeup, wash it off. <br>  Apply any cover-up for scars and acne. <br>  Apply foundation. <br>  If you are thirty or under, you may not need much foundation. <br>  If you are over thirty, or have your heart set on using foundation, blend it in softly and spread it as evenly as you can. <br>  Choose the correct blush. <br>  If you have fair skin, try a light pink blush. <br>  Olive skin can use a golden pink. <br>  Dark skin should use berry shades. <br>  Tawny skin might go with the browner shades of the spectrum. <br>  Determine the shape of your face to apply the blush. <br>  Apply blush from the apples of the cheeks to the temples for oval, square, and heart-shaped faces. <br>  For a round face apply blush from the corners of the mouth to the temples. <br>  Make your nose look smaller by applying blush closer to your nose. <br>  Draw attention away from your nose by using exciting shades for your lips or eyes- something that brings the viewers eye somewhere else. Be careful only to highlight one feature- otherwise this can turn out tacky or outdated. <br>  To determine the shape of your face brush all your hair away from your face and tie it back or use a headband. With a lipstick or some sort of eyebrow pencil, trace the outline of your face while looking into a mirror. Look to see if the outline is an oval, square, heart-shaped, or round shape. <br>  Avoid rings or studs, as these draw attention to your nose. <br>  Some makeup can be harmful to sensitive skin. Look for non-comodogenic makeup, or another makeup that has worked for you in the past. To check if makeup is safe, put a little on the back of your wrist and wait twenty-four hours to see if you have an allergic reaction or any other type of unwanted reaction. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|02PXcC95aa	This sounds weird, but i swear by it.<br>  take an eyeshadow shade that is 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone, and take the little spongy brush thign it comes with, and draw a thin line right on the bridge of your nose. blend it in on the sides, to make sure it dosent just look like some weird light line on your nose!<br>  me and my friends tried it, (we're 14 btw haha) and we took pics of before and after, and it actually really worked!<br>  hope i helped!|`|m3KC6M8daa	you dont need to try to change your nose im sure its beautiful, i have a big nose a consider it a gift|`|xDOkuxOXaa	plastic surgery!|`|PQQipirDaa	honestly, you are going to have to play around with it. Yes, probably 1 and then 3. and 3.(I think that was supposed to be a 4) not underneath your nose but from the bridge all the way down to your nostril are on the sides.<br>  <br>  As for how much that is definitely not something someone can tell you. Get out your make up and play around with it. Whenever I get new make up, I always do that anyway (I'm like a little kid, try out a look take it all off and start over again)<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, you can go to a make up counter like Estee Lauder or Clinique and get a makeover, stress that this is an issue for you and they will do it and explain to you exactly how to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  My experience I have been wearing make up for around 10 years and my sister does make up for her job.<br>  <br>  As wide as that you probably are not really going to be able to do that much actually. Learn to love yourself and your features. Play up your eyes or something to draw attention there instead or something like that.

iHna2K7Gaa	Purple is a great color for bringing out brown eyes, especially your shade of brown. Another good color is emerald green. It sounds weird, but if you do it right it will look amazing with your eyes and skin.<br>  <br>  You should go on YouTube or Google and look up Bollywood or Arabian makeup. You are one of few people who could totally pull that off.<br>  <br>  Also, you should definitely try doing a smokey eye and a cat eye. They would look fabulous on you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|OOtme2jkaa	green and like a goldish..or yellowish..|`|idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. <br>  Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes. <br>  Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown. <br>  Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it. <br>  Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|Eog7lFpGaa	I have the same eye color, I use a purple quad eyeshadow (L'Oreal Eva's Violet <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/external/images/products/large/Cos37f_3_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/ex...</a> ).<br>  which is like a light purple-ish pink all over, then white on the brow bone, a shimmery purple on the crease, and then dark purple right above the eyelashes on the lid.

Women are quick to point out other womens' flaws, whereas some men are simply happy to be with a woman, and aren't as critical about her appearance. Looks are not always about attracting a man----sometimes, its more about feeling like all the other women are envious of you, which also means that they're not competition.|`|5Ho7uxMVaa	If you have enough logic thought, It makes perfect sense to rise any girl's self-esteem, if it is too low. Some girls are looking to hear compliments, but some really need a boost. It is not homosexual and it is not lesbian. It is simply helping a girl feel better about her self and feel as beautiful as she is.|`|TJSjJ0juaa	hah its not homo to call another girl pretty, well calling them sexy are hot might be,it totally depends if they were kidding or not. And its just that some people are insecure about the way they look,some are just curious. and i think both guy and girl answers can be sincere i have seen some pretty mean answers from guys,and girls,it totaly depends on that person.|`|bb0475591b55a7ce0be68d3107ada5edaa	girls shouldn't just be "pretty" for guys, if a girl is pretty, she should be pretty to EVERYONE. As for me, I would be happier if girls think I'm pretty because it's harder for them to think other girls are pretty. as for guys, they don't care...|`|1cd3970815540116c7dc6d3dca251ca9aa	Um you obviously know nothing about girls.  Girls always notice and comment on other girl's looks.<br>  <br>  And it's not really girls' fault - all comes from society - the media places pressure on girls to look a certain way. Tv, magazines, celebrities etc all influence pple into thinking that females should look perfect.<br>  <br>  It's no wonder girls are so worried about what they look like.  I agree we shouldn't be rating each other on looks.  <br>  <br>  Sadly, Yahoo just shows what society is like.|`|L9JfmPkiaa	it's not homo...usually<br>  girls just normally know what kind of answers<br>  other girls are looking for<br>  so we know that the more we leave out<br>  the more in question the girl is going to be.<br>  and being told you're pretty by another girl<br>  shows that you are prolly genuinely pretty<br>  and thought of that way<br>  not only by guys, but by other people|`|2ATrNu3caa	Umm.I want girls to think I'm pretty. You are obviously a boy or you wouldn't need to answer this. A girl wants EVERYONE to think she's pretty. Even the creepy grandpa that's always sitting on his porch across the streetxD.. And girl's give more insightful advice because we have experience and can EMPATHIZE.|`|W0kEGRhraa	girls can call other girls pretty. <br>  it is not like a crime. <br>  sometimes girl's opinions on another girl can be very true and helpful other times it is just harsh for no reason.|`|DgCRryxFaa	Girls have better fashion sense than men.  They can usually help each other more.  And I would much rather be told I was beautiful instead of hot.|`|cQ9T3YNmaa	mostly girls are wanting to either impress boys or make other girls jealous.<br>  doesn't make them homo.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	girls are always critical and harsh towards other girls, its in our nature haha.|`|1OEDcz6Raa	cuz there is never guys that answer them.|`|RLi3iFXlaa	haaterrr .

The food will give you the energy you need when working out.<br>  <br>  Once you are fueled, you'll need to exercize.  You should do crunches and leg lifts every other day.  Muscles will get harder only if you give them time to heal after you rip them.(yes, you do rip them while you exercise, but thats how they grow.)  On that every other day, just go for a jog or run.|`|b116a2c1aa7dae17fc4f699c57f1e217aa	Work out three times for three weeks for one hour. Thats how I did it... do crunches, push ups, sit ups, dumpbell walks- you must eat right every day get the amount of veges, fruit, bread, and stuff.

TCpTlCTRaa	If your hair is falling from the roots it is probably not from the straightener. It could be a condition called telogen effluvium. It is becoming more common with young teenagers. This type of hair loss is usually temporary and reversible once the cause is identified and addressed. This can happen after new medication, vaccination, hormonal changes, recent illness or infection especially if high fever was involved, dental work, extreme diet and weight loss, etc. If it is from one of these causes the hair usually begins to shed 1-3 months later. You may find more information by reading the article on teenage hair loss sited below.|`|O3U7aLCDaa	For the idiot who said ur getting cancer, cancer doesn't cause hair loss, the cancer treatment causes hair loss.(I would know cuz my mom had cancer). Make sure your eating enough food so that ur healthy.  Just continue to not use any heat on your hair including hair dryers.  Wait about 3 more weeks and if it doesn't stop then see a doctor.  <br>  There may not be anything wrong.  Some people just begin to loose their hair even at age 13.  But see a doctor after 3 weeks if it continues.|`|so0NgwHjaa	Hi, im 13 too, and i have the same problem, just not as extream, i do get times where im straightening and i look down on my lap (i sit down & straighten) and theres hair all over my lap. But generally, i just get it if i grab my hair to put it over my shoulder or something if i carry on down to the end there will be hairs that just slide out the bottom, i always, get hair all over my school jumper etc, but my hairs not thinning, and its growing really well, so i'm not too bothered. But i think you should maybe ask your mum to take you to the doctors or something just to make sure its nothing serious, or anything to be worried about. Plus i have fine thin hair too, always have done, i dont mean thin as in you can see my scalp through my hair or anything, as i am 13, just most people in my year have quite thick bushy kinda hair, where as i have naturally straight thin hair, but i still straighten it. So yeah, my best advice is to see if your hair starts thinning out because of the hair loss, if it doesnt theres not too much to be worried about? But maybe a quick pop into the doctors, im sure everythings fine though xx|`|AA12147036	Your stressed out.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Short-Stories/The-Covered-Peephole.381219" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Short-Stories/Th...</a>|`|FgahTFoMaa	dont worry<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you'll be bald by the time ur 16 then you wont have to mop it up|`|EWPwE8qLaa	Omg my hair does the same thing!!!!!!!!!! My hair stylist told me to not too straighten my hair every day because it is burning my hair and it makes it weak. He told me wash my hair every other day and after I wash it put in leave in conditioner and brush it through. My hair falls all over the place and I have even got little hairs on top because my hair snaps and now my bangs are doing it. If your hair keeps falling out like a lot go to the doctor you don't want short hairs on top it's so embarrassing. Hope this helps some. Good Luck!!!|`|n3pSWkg0aa	it could be because it's fine and weak and you damage it by straightening it. it could also be that maybe you don't get enough vitamins or don't eat enough. but for now you can by a type of shampoo that strengthens your hair and helps prevent it from falling out, it's a herbal kind i think, and also take vitamins too just to be sure. but if i were you i would go to the doctors, it could be cancer or something like that.|`|sL6WzMPraa	um your answer is so obvious you have weak hair, and your damaging it by straightening it so often that its bound to fall out. if it was healthy and undamaged it would be strong enough to stay on your head|`|1XxVxFikaa	you are frying your hair!stop straight ironing it and see what happens,if it doesn't stop see a doctor or maybe stylist and get a shampoo or conditioner to help make it stronger or something.|`|lbrlkwg9aa	Since your hair is so weak and you straitin it to much wen you sholdent. Your jus damaging it a lot. You need to cut off all the hair you have damged or let it grow then kut it|`|LshGCecXaa	You should talk to your doctor, and you should stop straighting your hair. Like for years, if you want your hair to be better.|`|VrFa37q3aa	Umm i would ask a hair stylist about that and be careful with it <br>  <br>  but who knows, maybe its just hormones?1??!?!?!?!?!?<br>  <br>  good luck|`|KyqQb5Lxaa	you could be getting cancer|`|4ThRaoBOaa	um id be worried! see a doctor and fast hun|`|LeJ6Uu3raa	well everybody loses about 100 hairs a day. and even more when you shower. if it seems more than that go talk to your doctor about what might be going on.|`|5WfC3w2maa	I think you should go to the doctor because it might not be stress but it is something .|`|Fge2HEMmaa	The normal cycle of hair growth lasts for 2 to 6 years. Each hair grows approximately 1 centimeter (less than half an inch) per month during this phase. About 90 percent of the hair on your scalp is growing at any one time. About 10 percent of the hair on your scalp, at any one time, is in a resting phase. After 2 to 3 months, the resting hair falls out and new hair starts to grow in its place.<br>  <br>  It is normal to shed some hair each day as part of this cycle. However, some people may experience excessive (more than normal) hair loss. Hair loss of this type can affect men, women and children.<br>  Can improper care of my hair cause hair loss?<br>  Yes. If you wear pigtails or cornrows or use tight hair rollers, the pull on your hair can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia (say: al-oh-pee-sha). If the pulling is stopped before scarring of the scalp develops, your hair will grow back normally. However, scarring can cause permanent hair loss. Hot oil hair treatments or chemicals used in permanents (also called "perms") may cause inflammation (swelling) of the hair follicle, which can result in scarring and hair loss.<br>  Can my doctor do something to stop hair loss?<br>  Perhaps. Your doctor will probably ask you some questions about your diet, any medicines you're taking, whether you've had a recent illness and how you take care of your hair. If you're a woman, your doctor may ask questions about your menstrual cycle, pregnancies and menopause. Your doctor may want to do a physical exam to look for other causes of hair loss. Finally, blood tests or a biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed.<br>  <br>  Is there any treatment for hair loss?<br>  Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine. Recognizing and treating an infection may help stop the hair loss. Correcting a hormone imbalance may prevent further hair loss.<br>  <br>  Medicines may also help slow or prevent the development of common baldness. One medicine, minoxidil (brand name: Rogaine), is available without a prescription. It is applied to the scalp. Both men and women can use it. Another medicine, finasteride (brand name: Propecia) is available with a prescription. It comes in pills and is only for men. It may take up to 6 months before you can tell if one of these medicines is working.<br>  <br>  If adequate treatment is not available for your type of hair loss, you may consider trying different hairstyles or wigs, hairpieces, hair weaves or artificial hair replacement.|`|GVmGkfHZaa	I had the same problem last year and I'm 14 now.<br>  it could be that straightening your hair is damaging it causing it to break.. <br>  It could also be hormones. I went to see my doctor about it and he said it's a normal thing for girl's to lose a fair amount of hair during their teenage years. If it's coming out WAAAY too much I would go and ask your doctor what he thinks.<br>  <br>  I bought some vitamins that help stregthen hair and I also strated using a special shampoo that reduces breakage so maybe you should try that.<br>  <br>  Good luck  =)|`|KKxX5wszaa	Yikes, you are pretty young to be straightening your hair this much a week. You should reduce it to like one to two times a week. Or else invest in a more high quality hair straightener. Try Sephora, or a CHI. Anyways, I don't think you should worry that much. I don't think it's a medical condition. I think that the problem is that you are damaging your hair way too much sweetie. This happens to me too, but fortunately my hair is pretty thick. You hair on the other other hand is very thin, which is even worse if you keep on persisting on using your straightener that often. Do you spray any heat defiant product before straightening your hair. The hair that is falling, is due to the strength and heat of your straightener, it is too weak and thin to handle that everyday. So you hair is probably becoming dead and is simply falling out. I suggest you on using a different shampoo, or buy a better quality straightener, or simply stop straightening your hair. That's impossible though right? Haha, for us girls, when we start straightening our hair, we never ever want to appear in public again with our hair not straighten. Anyways, I hope that I helped you!

7k8iwvvOaa	The best lotion I have ever used and I swear by it is Curel.  <br>  Love it!<br>  <br>  Soft skin really starts in the shower and I am in love with the Eucerin Calming Body Wash.   Its a new product and it makes my skin so soft.  I think it must be because its very gentle and has some omega oils for dry skin.  <br>  <br>  If you havent heard of it yet heres a review on it.<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1451264/product_review_eucerin_calming_body.html?cat=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  These two products are both wonderful and dont leave skin oily.

I64JOuMKaa	Here this is what I did : ) !<br>  don't worry I understand your problem, your parents think you only need 2 holes even though more looks nice .<br>  <br>  Go to Claire's or Icing and go to the Magnetic earring section and buy a magnetic earring and wear it home. When your parents ask you if you got your ear pierced say no .. its just magnetic. Wear it for awhile then go get your ear pierced at a salon ( they don't ask for parents permission etc) It's like $20 at a salon depending on the earring you buy. Then when you get home your parents will think your earring is magnetic : ) ! <br>  <br>  that's what I did and it worked, pierced it a week ago ! Second hole above my first on my left ear : )<br>  <br>  Please don't do it yourself, it could get infected seriously.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	don't even consider doing it yourself or by a friend. My friend who tried to get her ear cartilage done herself had a major infection and she was rushed to the hospital where they had to remove that part of her ear because it was too late. Now she has a weirdly shaped ear.<br>  <br>  If you're only asking for your lobe to be pierced it's no biggy but even something else your parents are right to refuse that|`|clInlnIqaa	Do not do it yourself. It's dangerous. And don't go being your parents back and go against their wishes and get it done. That's a way to lose all your parents trust and respect. You need to sit them down and talk to them like an adult. Explain to them why you want to get piercings. Also explain that a piercing is something that can be removed.|`|ELkswWpCaa	it'd help to know how old you are now. if you're 17 or something you might as well just wait because at 18 you dont need a parents concent. if you're younger than start small, maybe tell them you'll do more chores and keep a higer gpa or get a's if you can get an ear peircing. or maybe make a deal, a "if i get all a's this quarter..." type thing. but i would only recomend doing this at all if you want ear peircings, body/face you may be out of luck. dont do it yourself only because they sound pretty strict so the end result may be grounding for a year and for what? a hole? haha.

DGXf3bFYaa	Spray body mist at the nape of your neck when your hair is wet. Wet hair holds smell better also the nape of your neck doesnt really have much contact with the air unless your hair is pulled up so that it doesn't dissipate as quickly|`|v0FlUan0aa	Juicy Couture has some of this spray for youre hair. its like a mist. you can get it at sephora for about 28$|`|2stBV6XBaa	Smells just dissipate.  There's not a lot you can do to change that other than to re-apply, but be careful with that.  Just because you can't smell it doesn't mean no one else can.  There's a thing called nasal fatigue.  It can happen when exposed to a smell for a long time or when you have smelled too many odors.  Like when you go perfume shopping and after about 5-7 of them, they all smell the same and they offer you coffee beans to neutralize it so you can keep smelling.  So, after a while you just can't smell yourself.  You might want to ask those around you if they can smell it to know if it's really gone or not.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Stand in front of a street cart that sells meats or chicken.|`|6xfp3bAVaa	I agree.

gZ7BJVZxaa	when i got my tongue pierced i had my piercer look at my industrial because it had bumps too, he said they're keloids and probably hereditary. <br>  i get them all the time. i've taken my piercings out because i'm just not a proper healer.<br>  don't be discouraged it happens to a lot of people, part of the healing process.<br>  you really can't do much other than let it heal. clean it out. use some sea salt, use a cup, hold it over the piercing, rinse.|`|ec800966099e02a9090fd20472ae5565aa	I agree with the above....<br>  <br>  I have had this problem because I stupidly tried to pierce my belly button myself (yeah... it's not as easy as piercing your own ears). I got it professionally done but every once in a while the scar from my attempt flairs up, sometimes it even gets infected. <br>  <br>  the best thing to do is keep it clean, and before you go to bed put a little neosporin on it (be careful NOT TO GET IT IN THE PIERCING because it is a puncture wound and can trap in bacteria). this will help it heal and keep it clean. wash it off when you wake up. it's gotten rid of mine quiet a few times.

"Handsome face" is a very broad term, since different girls think different guys are handsome. For example I think he is handsome (sorry but he's my celeb crush!): <a href="http://images.starpulse.com/pictures/2007/10/11/previews/Nick%20Jonas-ESA-002022.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.starpulse.com/pictures/200...</a><br>  And my best friend thinks he's average. So my point is, a question like "is this really what girls find attractive?" doesn't have a real answer.

I'm a guy and this attracts me so...|`|5dMw30kMaa	Maybe a dark burgandy or brown, depends if you want red in it or if you want your hair just to be darker. Whatever color you choose though I recommend loreal preference, it's been the best for me so far. Make sure to get color shampoo and conditioner too otherwise the color will wash out fast. I like garnier fructis color shield, you can get it at costco in jumbo bottles for cheap (at least my costco haha)|`|GcOHKz5xaa	Leave it the way it is! There's no better color than natural color (the one you are born with!). If anything, get highlights, but don't dye.

Go to a salon and it will turn out perfect, as long as it's not a cheap $10.00 salon. If you do it yourself you have the chance of your hair turning orange, or different shapes of blond. If you're wanting a all around color, and all of it to be the same color GO TO A SALON, or if you know someone that for a fact! knows what they're doing then you can take the chance of letting them do it. If you do have a friend or someone do it, get all of your products at Sally's Beauty Supply store.

AA11283813	Good for you!  Makeup is soooo plastic.  And if you are lucky enough to have good skin then you are really doing the right thing.<br>    If you don't think that your cheeks have enough color in them....then when you are really self-conscious about it you can rub your cheeks with the back of your hand...gently.  That will put some good color in them...BUT....you really need to practice this because if you over do it then it looks like you really layered something on.<br>      Natural is so pretty on so many people that are lucky enough not to have to wear makeup.<br>         Make up is there to enhance your beauty....not to cover it up.

yd6iUJs1aa	Depends on many factors, like hair type, location, money range, and many more.<br>  <br>  If you are tight on money and don't like the fly aways, i suggest the bed head light series, which focuses on negative ions causing your fly aways to stay tamed. Downsides are if humidity hits it can take a toll on your hair and it may start to flip, and it's almost impossible to curl with.<br>  <br>  They're are the iso series which are the ones you can fiind in the mall, curls and straightens nicely and major plus, if you find a problem with it or just simply don't like the color, it has a life time guarantee and you can take it in for a new one no questions asked. Downsides, the price is a little up there and since it comes from a mall booth the prices can vary.<br>  <br>  And then there are the chi. Though highly over priced, they can be worth it, not only do they straighten and curl (perfectly), the effect with stay with you all day. And your hair will remain frizz free may i add.<br>  <br>  Go to a salon and ask, but i warn you they will be biased because either they will try to sell you their product, or they will try to sell you the highest priced for a bonus.|`|aEonduUUaa	Depends on what temperature ur hair can handle.

MXL0YxV2aa	If you're doing it yourself, cut the acrylic nails as short as you can.  Then soak them in acetone for a good 10 minutes.  Remove the loose acrylic as much as you can without damaging your nail.  If the acrylic won't budge, don't force it.<br>  The next step is to just file it down as much as you can.  This usually takes a while, which is why professional salons use an electric nail file.<br>  <br>  It's the best way to remove acrylic nails without damaging your natural nails.<br>  (Whatever you do...don't force it.  It'll take off layers of your natural nail and leave it ugly and thin, which'll make it very sensitive until your nails grow out.)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Soaking your nails in acetone for 10 minutes one won't do anything to your nails.<br>  Only if you soak your nails a few times a week, that's when it would actually get bad.|`|tIJCQc8Xaa	Soak them in strong nailpolish remover then file away the left over glue.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtiDz860j.SB4U8TyxgOk_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219223518AAMpDeJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|mgoweDz1aa	soak them in warm water and acetone. it will help soften and wear away the glue ish stuff they use to attach it
5HOyupgfaa	obviously, the best advice would be not to do it, but if you want to, <br>  you should sanitize a needle with alcohol and use a lighter to burn the germs off the part of the needle youre going to use. then, yes, you should numb your ear with ice, it helps a ton. and instead of using an apple, use a potato, its much better. just put it behind your ear then stick the needle thru. some people like to just shove the needle thru quickly, but i think its better to do it slowly and it might help if you bite down on a hand towel. if you dont chicken out and you really do pierce it, make sure to clean it every night, rubbing alcohol also works to do this|`|uX7rFRcyaa	yes.<br>  i did that before, and believe or not even a sewing needle works XD<br>  but don't recommend doing that, because I was VERY careful. it's a wonder that it didn't get infected.<br>  <br>  and yes, the ice and the apple thing definetly helps. <br>  do it.(:|`|DRrJ0fuQaa	Ummm you need to sanitize the needle with rubber alcohol and then ice your ice for about 15 mins! make sure you have cleaning solution you can also heat the needle with a lighter  to make it go threw faster|`|VxbdjKIKaa	You are SO brave.

In college I had a friend with black hair who used to acheive the same results using koolaid powder (make sure it doesn't have sugar in it...the little packets not the tubs of powder)...but careful- that stuff can stain just about anything- skin, tile, tubs.....
p8xUCZIVaa	Hey there, I work in a professional tattoo studio as an apprentice and my brother is a tattooist.<br>  <br>  A few suggestions:<br>  - You could get the name written within a scroll and choose whether you would like some light shading behind this.<br>  <br>  - You could research fonts on the internet on websites such as 'dafont.com' and when you've decided what font you would like, you can print it off and take it to the studio and they'd be more than welcome to do it for you and possibly add more ideas on if you wanted.<br>  <br>  - If the childs name related to anything or has a meaning to it, then you could get the object of meaning and either have the name written within the design or have the object next to the name.<br>  <br>  - You could also go to the studio and ask for them to draw you up a few ideas, or use your own or ask them to develop ideas from your own.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.<br>  Also, chinese names aren't always right - don't trust the internet search engines as you could end up with something ridiculous on your body like 'Egg-fried rice'.   :/|`|ALdA311Caa	If you wanted it in Chinese make the letters look like strokes of a brush.

AA11910088	I didnt know that nail polish was bad for you so I really dk|`|GocoTwtvaa	Just try it on like a paper.<br>  And if it seems fine.<br>  But theres really nothing that can make it harmfulll...<br>  It doesnt matter how much it is i got nail polish for 12 bucks it was perfect then i got on that was 88 cents it was way better..<br>  So no its not harmful<br>  <br>  Good Luck :]]|`|6NPv1TKQaa	Well, actually, plenty of nail polishes specificaly have certain things that are good for your nails. Obviously the more expensive ones, but they can do wonders for hardening your enamel and giving your nails a fresher lok.<br>     Anyway, i wouldnt worry too much about that nail polish. I'd say when you use it, dont abuse it. Give it a few breaks between uses, because over polishing without base coats can be harmful to your nails and make them gradualy become weaker over time. I have invested in plenty of cheap bottles of nail polish, and normally if the color didnt wash off the first time I washed my hands, my nails were perfectly fine afterwards. <br>     Just take care of your nails after each use. Apply lotion, file and buff, etc. Dont sweat it!!!!|`|RfLr48woaa	Nail polish, per se, isn't bad, but if you leave it on too long, or use it continually, your nails can't "breathe", like leaving something in the dark too long can kill it. So give your nails a break once a week, also the chemicals in both polish and remover are absorbed by both your nose and your nails, not to mention the possibility of infection from double-dipping of polish remover. If polish was only a buck, chuck it and use clear polish. Infections are much more costly.|`|d5GfhPM4aa	well if someone used it before you bought it then you can get an infection but if you paint your nails alot they turn yellow and that doesnt look very nice lol and you can buy 99 cent polish it makes no difference just make sure no one else used it before|`|hxvKkvP8aa	nail polish is not harmful...it actually protects the cuticle from damage. its probably just fine to use even though it was so cheap. i dont think the polish will do any harm to you what so ever!<br>  <br>  :)|`|4Q5OwgU8aa	as long as you use a clear coat underneath or a nail protectant formula, you should be okay. i change my nailpolish like everyother day, i use nail polish remover, a clear coat then the polish, and i still have my nails! <br>  <br>  hope that helps, and good luck!
vJ43AOgkaa	i would get a very basic, <br>  cotton jacket.<br>  do it in sections...<br>  you have to use fabric glue.<br>  put the glue down then dump the glitter <br>  on the glue and dump the<br>  access glitter off.<br>  and continue.<br>  make sure the first side is dry<br>  before you do the other side.<br>  :)|`|0AQF8pnKaa	pour glue on it and then use a sponge brush (you can get them for a $1 at any home supply store or a craft store) and then dump the glitter on it. after its dried brush off the excess. then do the other side of the jacket.|`|6e2p7fjXaa	You could use spray adhesive, which is like spray paint glue, and spray the jacket, then pour the glitter on. you could also use pigments instead of glitter: pigments are really shiny too, but they wont be as overwhelming as standard silver glitter etc.<br>  <br>  im not sure if the glue will make the jacket stiff though...i guess you could sew on sequins?<br>  <br>  you could also just spray paint it the color you want, and the sprinkle some glitter on it, while it's wet.|`|OQhVwtpFaa	dip your jacket in a bucket of glue, and then into a bucket of glitter.<br>  <br>  <br>  & no matter what it is, if you use glitter... some pieces will ALWAYS fall off
bhyUX6kkaa	There are lots of different ways to learn how to become a makeup artist. First of all it depends on how much you are willing to spend and where you live.<br>  Private schools are lots of money or colleges means that you have to devote lots of time to classes (meaning, no or little work).<br>  Also, you need to be in a city where these classes are held. <br>  I am a makeup artist for some years now, but before I was I did lots of research on this topic.<br>  <br>  Some of the private schools are makeup designery (MUD) or there's Joe Blasco... Lots more. <br>  Be prepared to spend thousands though. <br>  <br>  I personally lived in a smallish town and relocating to LA or NY for a couple months was out of the question. I couldn't afford the tuition let alone rent and travel to the city. <br>  <br>  I found a really great at home course that teaches the beauty makeup in full detail and used that. It wasn't a lot and I made back the price of it with my first gig as a makeup artist. <br>  <br>  Now when ever I feel I want to advance in a specific field like Special Effects or something I just a quick seminar that also doesn't cost thousands.<br>  <br>  The course I used was the event makeup artist|`|wNXq55tWaa	you can go to beauty school and just learn that. i want to do the same but not hair or nails because you can't really redo that stuff lol|`|kdn7bZ1gaa	Community Colleges, universities, internships, work at a makeup store, :D hope this helps <br>  <br>  answer mine if you wanna be a make up artist :)|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Beauty school

The lipstick probably washes you out when you wear it. But if you really like it, and don't care what people say then you should go for it and wear the lipstick.|`|5PBK1Nc6aa	no way! i love wearing red lipstick and im very pale. its all about finding the right shade of red,  i red true reds, or orangey-reds work best on my skin
yKnN3lAnaa	Basically the only downsides to using proactive refining mask are that it smells bad and if you use to much it seriously drys out your skin.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I have tied every prescription out there (minus acutane), and only proactiv works. Well, the AcneClear brand from Target or CVS is half the price, and works ALMOST as well.<br>  <br>  Use the mask ONLY at night- it can smell real bad, and it is hard to get the smell out unless you shower after, and even after that it still lingers. And it will stain your pillow case up real bad.|`|3EBGykXEaa	i really think the only good product is the refining mask. the rest of the system did NOT work for me at all.<br>  <br>  the refining mask dries out pimples and stop new ones from forming, but it can make your skin really dry.|`|gTN9RF1Aaa	i tried proactive and it sucks!!! what you should do is get a prescription for benzaclin from a dermatologist.. it is AMAZING and cleared up my face in a couple weeks at most

nKL7v9vbaa	Well, it's good that you exercise, but in order to avoid bacne, you need to shower IMMEDIATELY. It's not good to wait even more than 10 minutes because then the bacteria lingers.<br>  <br>  I used "Neutrogena Body Clear" wash and scrub. It works really well, and now they have it in grapefruit smell. If that doesn't help any bit, try going to a local spa and get a "back facial." Does the same as a facial would do for the skin on your face.|`|JsuQEvrDaa	Do u have long hair sometimes if I use certain products in my hair I will breakout I think it is an Allergy I would apply some baking soda paste and wash your hair with all natural or hypo allergenic shampoo|`|REoNMbanaa	Your local drug store sells a type of acne cleanser made especially for your body.

2EobcGqqaa	I think what you have planned out is perfect.  Only you know what you want the art to represent on your body.  I would put "looking up to you "like you said|`|q34jUwQBaa	getting symbolic tattoos isn't really about the design, its about how you remember the person and what is significant to them. <br>  <br>  My sister loves dragonflies and often in my dreams i see her as a dragonfly, not a human, so im getting a little dragonfly behind my ear to represent her. its not big and people wont see it but having her on my body is what matters.<br>  <br>  so what im trying to say is whats really important is how it feels to you, not what it looks like.|`|4S3pvbK0aa	that could be a lot, i mean expensive not too much, but i like it maybe put his middle initial too. <br>  so like the Cross and the Ivy and maybe his initials on the butterfly's wing <br>  where would you put it?<br>  Maybe in your wrist or ankle.<br>  <br>  My dad died when I was 7, my brother when i was really young like 1, and my grampa when i was 11, so I was thinking of getting a tattoo like this:<br>  c.g.c.<br>  g.a.l.<br>  t.s.l.<br>  <br>  It would be on my ankle, do you like it or no, what could make it better?<br>  <br>  And because of all this I know how you feel, so Im sorry|`|frtv3C9maa	That sounds like a really pretty design and it's a really sweet thing to do:)|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Whatever you think you suit him more hun. xxx|`|jVUbjpYgaa	It's all up to you. <br>  Don't let someone tell you its too much, because only you know the meaning behind it, and how much it does actually mean to you.<br>  <br>  i think its all a good idea. <br>  You could always get the cross with butterfly, underneath have the quote, and on the other side of the bar have his initials.<br>  <br>  ab.

cXQmtN1Saa	-Stick concealer over a powder foundation: Hmm, this doesn't sound like it would work out well because the textures of the two products are completely different so they wouldnt be able to adhere to eachother well. And you'd probably have to put some powder on top of the concealer after that to set it.. so THREE layers on your face would definitely look cakey. <br>  <br>  -Powder foundation over a stick concealer: Doing this helps set the concealer so it looks smooth and lasts all day. You just have to make sure you blend the concealer into your face well or it will be realllly obvious where you put it (since powder foundation doesnt have much coverage). Oh and if you're up for trying something new, you could put stick concealer over a liquid foundation.. it works really well.<br>  <br>  ~Hope this helpss. :]|`|a1gSZzoyaa	it looks more natural the other way around but you can put the stick on after wards if you must.

I got my first one directly on my spine, and when he would go over it, it would hurt. But other spots while he was doing that tattoo I couldn't even feel.

peCSAJlXaa	I probably am as old or older than your mother and I have tried Bare Minerals.  I found that the foundation made my face itch and it made the lines under my eyes look worse.  After doing research I found that if the product contains bismuth oxychloride it is not recommeneded for people with roseacea or acne.  This also causes the itching that I had.  Look up Everyday Minerals, they offer a sample kit for just shipping.  It is good way to try them and if your Mom likes them she can pick out what she wants and you can order them for her.  This would be a wonderful gift for any Mom.|`|kTTK2YoCaa	Merle Norman mineral make-up is the best!!!|`|2hMhANqDaa	bare minerals was the first, i'm not sure who followed|`|RMhI10hFaa	Bare Minerals from Bare Escentuals is the best hands down. I tried alot of other mineral makeups, but Bare Minerals is all natural and doesnt clog pores. It will do wonders for your mother because it makes woemn look younger and fresher naturally. Sure its big $$ but one thing of the foundation lasts me about 4 months, and i use a generous amount every day. The warmth and mineral veil last way longer than that. Great investment, and a great gift for your mother! good luck. =]|`|URJyU1q5aa	Bare minerals is the BEST mineral powder ever. It goes on good and looks nice.

ibaLRXY2aa	The bladeless shaving lasts longer because it dissolves the hair below the skin's surface, but the cream can sting or burn if you have sensitive skin. I prefer standard shaving because of my sensitve skin.|`|mk7O29Puaa	Instead of shaving, consider waxing! Yes, pain is involved, but the results are much more pleasing. When the hair returns weeks later, it is smooth thin hair. Each time you wax, the skin is less sensitive. I have my eyebrows, upper lip and chin waxed once a month..I hardly feel it now...<br>  <br>  As for the bikini area, men say they have no preference until they actually see it waxed(women). After seeing the bare smooth skin, they will never go back...that's a fact!|`|62eeeb0c8478404fb608eca3a25ae462aa	i go for the creams bit messy but works well for me and im male

They seem to grow fast. I'm not sure if it will work for you, but if you don't like having them pink or black or any other color, just use transparent nail polish. It still works for me.I hope it works for you too.|`|JIkZ5mBdaa	well there is this nail polish that you can but at CVS, or walgreens, or other stores like that and it works good. or if you don't want to bite them get them done like go to a solon. thats what i do because i also have a problem with that. and i get my nails done|`|1vzAvmEbaa	There is some nail polish that has proteins in it that will help nails grow faster. Hey, its worth a try!|`|gTN9RF1Aaa	you can usually go to a drug store or a beauty store and get some nail growth formula that can improve your nail length in 5-7 days... i use it and it totally works!!!|`|LiiDOQWqaa	get garlic nail polish its supposed to make your nails grow faster.|`|bFOqf40zaa	calcium pills or milk|`|YVNeeIIIaa	They have a nail polish type thing you can put on your nails so when you go to bite them it tastes bitter and disgusting. Once you've stopped biting, don't use the special nail growth nail polish those really don't work, instead eat plenty of lean protein, eat raw fruits/veggies, drink water, moisturize with a good moisturizer on hands and massage lotion into cuticles while pushing back cuticles. When filing your nails don't go in a back and forth motion go in one direction. Try using a buffing block to make nails smoother and shiny. Remember to also clip off hangnails don't bite them! I find vaseline or Curel works as the best lotion.

I like the way your eyes look in the first picture on yourself, but I think I like your facial expression in the third pic.<br>  <br>  I think that with some practice you can get your make-up to look cleaner and more sleek, but it just takes practice, patience and getting the brand of make-up that best suits you.<br>  <br>  I and partial to liquid eye liner most of the time, it has a more clean cut look to it. If I want that smoky look or if I want to be able to smudge it I use a creamy pencil.

4KDDFobnaa	Maybe you're low in iron. Try eating more red meat. It could also be from heredity. Do people in your family have it? You can try makeup to cover it up.|`|WQV4cfSuaa	It is probably because either your mascara is pooling in the bottoms of your eyes, or some girls have naturally dark circled eyes. One good way to get rid of the puffyness is kiwi will really help! (read that in magazine). To cover your dark circles, apply a concealer a shade lighter than your skin tone under your pupil. Then blend it to the inside and out sides of your eyes. Also, shades of yellow eye shadow will help your eyes. Good luck :)|`|Mb5Lwxudaa	It might be that your skin is so thin that it shows the purple veins inside. Giving it a dark color.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Firstly, infected tattoos, although fairly rare, are almost always a consequence of poor aftercare and is a completely different thing to having contracted a blood borne virus such as Hepatitis from a tattoo. The latter would be contracted from a contaminated needle and is a serious illness that would affect your entire body, not something that would show any symptoms through your tattoo. Also Hep B doesn't show up for many weeks, and Hep C I think takes years. You would be very ill if you had contracted Hepatitis.<br>  <br>  But as for getting a wound infection - it doesn't sound like you have this problem to me. It would be red and swollen and oozing pus, and very painful. Itching is common and nothing to worry about and can often go on for long after your tattoo appears to have otherwise healed. A piece I got on my back a few months ago was like this, it visibly healed very fast but continued to itch for a good six weeks, but eventually stopped! There is a small chance you could be experiencing some sort of allergy, but it's very rare these days now that the inks they use have mostly changed, but it isn't unheard of. But there are many other things that can cause itching and bumps so I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. However I would suggest a doctors visit. Nothing beats peace of mind, and in the unlikely event that you are experiencing an allergy he'll be able to give you better advise than your tattoo artist would. But even if that were the case - it's nothing life threatening and nothing that will ruin your tattoo by the sounds of it, but something you'd be able to be prescribed something for if it were necessary. But I really doubt this will be the case - but I'm not a doctor!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	It is a sign that you are having an allergy to the ink. The red ink is the likely culprit - lots of people are sensitive to it. Good news is that the bumps will eventually go away. Bad news is that it may take a while. My friend got flames tattooed up his arm and he had bumps on his red part for 6 months. But it went away. <br>  <br>  If it was infected, it would be hot to the touch and oozing stuff. If you are super concerned about it, go back to the place you got it done at. Ask them what is up. They are the professionals and would be able to better diagnose you than any of us on here.|`|6rekJZ9Jaa	all tattoos itch when they heal, thats normal. The "bumps" might just be the tattoo scabbing over. Thats normal too. If your really worried you can always just go back to the tattoo parlor and have the artist look at it. I doubt theres anything wrong with you that they haven't seen before. They will tell you what to do.|`|v5J50Ep2aa	This is normal! the bumps are scabs! and its itchy cuz its healing!
gsCQVhCxaa	I would say either the top of your foot, or inside your wrist. If you have it on the inside of your wrist a chunky watch will cover it so you can still wear short sleeve blouses for work in summer, if you go for the top of the foot you can wear shoes that cover it. I would go for the wrist though, it will look cutest there I reckon|`|TlqLncKsaa	top of your foot, back of ur neck where ur hair will hide it, back of shoulder(either one). I really want one behind my ear, so cute!|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I wouldn't suggest your ankle.  If you ever get a professional job and have to wear skirts and dresses, you would not want it seen.  Some jobs do not even allow tattoos so you definitely do no want it seen.  Perhaps the place between your back shoulder and neck where a shirt can always cover it.|`|6rekJZ9Jaa	I got my first tattoo on my chest. It's just under my collarbone on the left right above my breast. It's a great place for a small tattoo because you can hide it easily but it also shows when you were like a tank top or something. Good Luck!|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	behind the ear is really cute... i have a star behind one ear and a moon behind the other ear.. they are small, can be hidden if need be and the they didn't hurt much|`|q34jUwQBaa	on ur writst. im glad you dont want a tramp stamp, they r iky
kCdISEGqaa	Then wait until you're older, and then decide if it's really what you want to do.  Why do you want to be a tattoo artist?  Unless you own your own shop you will never make any money.  There's no fame or fortune like they show on the cable channels.  Are you an artist?  Can you do more than draw and color?  Tattooing is a very different art, the skin is a very different media to work on, you can't just trace and color the design in.  Remember, you are tattooing someone's body, and it will be with them forever, and if you mess it up, you can't just erase it and start over.  So many people get into tattooing because they think it's cool.  If you're curious, I got into tattooing because I was an art school graduate, who didn't know what to do with her life.  I met my husband, who had some tattooed friends.  I got a tattoo, and fell in love with the process.  I found it an interesting challenge and wanted to learn more.  I spent a lot of time with different artists getting tattooed, and eventually talked one of those artists, thanks Nick, into an apprenticeship.  I had to pay for my apprenticeship, and scrubbed floors and bathrooms, and instructed people how to fill out their information forms.  It's not glamorous by any means.  Best wishes.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	In most places you do not actually have to be 18 to begin a tattooing apprenticeship. But it's that age before you can begin tattooing human flesh legally. So if you're 16 or 17 and are really serious about this, you can even start trying now - your chances of being taken on at a younger age may be lower, but you'll lose nothing by trying.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, start working on building up a good portfolio. This is the first thing an artist will ask to see if he's even considering taking you on as an apprentice. So it will need to be impressive, because there is a lot of competition out there. I suggest you buy yourself a couple of books, and start reading tattoo magazines if you don't already. Read up on the different styles, and start practicing a variety of styles. You can start by tracing things. Tracing images repeatedly will help you develop consistency and steadiness. While it will help to have a variety of media in your portfolio just to demonstrate your general skill, the artist will mostly be looking at your illustrating ability and things like linework and shading techniques. So focus mostly on that, and tracing will help improve those techniques, before you can start producing original pieces for the portfolio. <br>  <br>  Join some tattoo forums and get talking to other tattoo artists, get a handle on the language they use and over time you'll develop a better knowledge of equipment, techniques, sterilisation procedures, etc. All of this will give you a head start.<br>  <br>  Start saving up. You will be expected to buy your own equipment, which does not come cheap. Most artists will also expect you to pay for the apprenticeship - some require a lump sum, some allow you to spread the cost. Occasionally you'll find someone offering a free apprenticeship, but you can't afford to be fussy. However beware - I've heard of sharks out there asking for X thousand in return for an apprenticeship lasting a few weeks long. Nobody can go from member of public to qualified tattoo artist in that time. So if you get an offer like that - walk away - they are after your money and have little interest in educating you. Although it is not unreasonable to expect to be paid for educating someone - you must ensure that you are receiving a genuine education. And make sure anybody taking you on has a few years under their belt. A studio has recently opened in my town, with five 'artists' - four apprentices and one guy who's been tattooing for under two years. It's a joke, and needless to say the work that comes out of that shop is abysmal - my artist was telling me the other day that instead of losing business to them, they are getting business from them in the form of the many coverups of their work they've already been asked to do! I'm digressing anyway, but yeah, make sure it is a pro that you are being trained by.<br>  <br>  Another thing - never be tempted to buy a machine yourself and start scratching. No tattoo artist will expect (or want) you to have any experience in tattooing. That's what they teach you. A prospective employer will not be impressed if you come to him with stories or photos of crappy, unsterile home jobs you've done.<br>  <br>  As for how to actually go about getting an apprenticeship. That's the hard part. It varies greatly on where you live - if you live in a big city with a lot of large tattoo studios you may find it easier than someone in a small town with only a couple of small nearby studios. So you may need to consider travelling for the right job. But it's a case of asking around, asking around, and asking around. Don't wait to see a sign in a shop window looking for an apprentice, because they're never there. Out of the artists I know, the majority got into it after having a lot of work done in one studio, forming a bond with their artist and eventually talking them into taking them on. It's pretty rare to walk in as a stranger and bag an apprenticeship, but not unheard of, so don't let that dishearten you - but do try and form a bond with artists in the future. Also, although it isn't a 'rule', I've never in my life seen a tattoo artist or apprentice without a fair amount of work on themselves. I don't know how serious an artist would take someone wanting to get an apprentice if they weren't tattooed, but I guess it depends on the individual. But don't be tempted to start getting tattoos underage. Not cool, not sensible - and your future employer certainly won't be impressed to hear that he'd been tattooing you as an underager (although he should have checked - and if somewhere tattoos you knowing you're an underager then this is not the kinda place you want to be working in imho). And just remember that just because a place has said no once, doesn't mean they never will. Keep trying - not to the point where you're pissing them off every week - but be relatively persistant and eventually somewhere might notice how serious you are.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Get together a good portfolio of art, then go to a tattoo studio once you're 18 and have some money saved up and get yourself an apprenticeship under a good artist.<br>  <br>  After a few years, you'll work your way up and get to be a tattoo artist if you have the chops for it.|`|2EobcGqqaa	Volunteer now with someone you know who is an artist to watch all of the procedures they go through to make the tattoo.

But i saw past that, and u should too.|`|haJTDGoxaa	I have the exact same problem!! Passed the teenage years and the puberty age, YET these pimples come to attack my face now!! I'm trying to find a pimple treatment solution but has not found the right one for my face yet. I have sensitive skin like yours too. Tried cutting down on snacks but to no avail. Thought exercising helps but it doesn't really help with the haze now. STRESS! We need to relax and drink LOTS OF WATER!! And drink fruit juice everyday. Get rid of all the toxins in out body with the liquid we take. I wish you all the best. PS: I'm thinking of seeing a dermatologist or New York Skin solution. Have you heard of New York Skin solution?
ncEDkLaraa	Let me start by saying, I've never tried this...but a long time ago I was watching a television program and these guest who were two ladies who had a bunch of home remedies. I will say that a lot of them held true. Before the commercial break they said they had a remedy for acne. I was so excited to find out what it was so i waited through all the commercials and when they came back the remedy was that when you wake up first thing in the morning, pee on a wash cloth and wash your face with it. I know this sounds made up but I swear that is what they said. They said it HAD to be the FIRST pee but swore it worked. As I said, I didn't have the guts to try this but if you;'re desperate to try anything...|`|sm7DJGOoaa	get some proactive or skin ID.<br>  <br>  and don't wash your face constently, it drys out the natural oils. get proavtive, it works amazingly. <br>  <br>  (:|`|tXOExTwiaa	creams & mosirizers cause most  pimples ! along with dirt build-up and makeup. foundation makeup causes alot of acne if you dont wash it off after a long day , <br>  <br>  the key to a clear comlextion is time: you have to have time to throughally wash your face at least once a day . try when you first get up or in the shower and then before you go   to bed,  its also good to wash it after school or work or whatever.  <br>  <br>  i suggjest proactive . gett ordering it absolutley works its no joke .<br>  <br>  and try using the boire nose strips as well every once or twice a month. :) <br>  <br>  buy a face mask and just putit on the one pimple or that areaa with the piimples , also dont get anything with exfolating hydrolifts they acually make them bigger and disturb them. it will get discusting,<br>  HOPE THIS HELPED :)|`|hXQ56DQKaa	Well, you could pop them--you have to use your nails to do that. I do that for really awful ones, and for just regularly keeping my face clean and preventing breakouts, I usually just use Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne wash in pink grapefruit. For blackheads, I use Neutrogena Oil-Eliminating Astringent. It works great. For dryness--I get that by my nose--just apply moisturizer everyday after you complete your facial cleansing routine.|`|sg6JieT8aa	try neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser. and my friend has a lot of pimples and she uses this stuff that realllyyyy stinks it is called tea tree oil I think. um, what it does is it acctually purposly makes your skn peel, and the pimple peels off too but that wouldn't help your skin. I have never had I dry skin problem when my twin sister even has, cause she uses 2 much skin cream I use a pea size amount of neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser and it gets rid of my zits and cleans my face. good luck.<br>  Piper|`|ykdaQarAaa	Use a cleanser like Cetaphil Gentle Facial Wash and exfoliate with a washcloth every couple days.<br>  <br>  Then use a light noncomedogenic moisturizer. <br>  <br>  Be patient and continue using the acne cream. Treatments can take up to a month to show their benefits.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I've had the exact same problem. :D

4KDDFobnaa	I had my monroe pierced before. Is the whitish yellow color on the outside of your lip or the inside? If it's on the inside, it may be an infection, I suppose. Is there pus and does it hurt? Is it red? Is it swollen? You would know if it was infected, I'm sure. If it's on the outside, it may just be healing. I would go to the piercer and see if they think it's an infection, and if they do, I would be sure to keep it really clean and go to the doctor to get antibiotics if it gets worse. If it's not infected, they may re-pierce it. You may not want to get it in the same spot though, because you might have developed scar tissue. Good luck.|`|y77Te4eUaa	does the piercing it self hurt? becuz the dis coloration might be the scar tissue and if it is scar tissue they should re pierce it for you but if its infected they would probably re locate it..

Make sure you wink a lot when you ask him/her, so they know YOU know about the secret magical tanning pill and then they'll sell it to you! <br>  But don't TELL anyone, it's a BIG SECRET!!!|`|6umR3PNraa	U don't HAVE to use a tanning lotion when u go tanning and y wont ur parents let u?<br>  explain to them that its not bad for u it it actually kinda good ..like people who are stressed out should go tanning to relax<br>  or buy a body bronze to make u darker...there must be one u not allergic to!
nKL7v9vbaa	I believe the first answerer means "scents," not flavors. Anyways, Nair does have an array of scents, but they're not exactly pleasant smelling. Depilators and sprays may not always work well. As you know, for a temporary but longer result, waxing is the best way to remove hair for atleast 2-6 weeks. <br>  <br>  Anyways, try going to a professional beauty store (such as Sally Beauty Supply) or even order from an Avon catalog. Unfortunately, for exclusive, professional stores, like C.B. Sullivan, you need proof of a beauty license. For example, if a person with a manicurist license wants to buy professional hair dye.....they can't because of what their license allows them to. With the other stores they have professional waxing tools and supplies.|`|kBn3UsjTaa	nair has a really good line of products and selections. They also come in many different flavors! Also, since as you mentioned there are some hard to wax areas, you may want to try hair removal spray.  Some you don't even have to spray. Nair has a cream where you just apply it and wash it off and it comes off with the hair. :)
9h5phsluaa	Hey! My name is Hillary and I"m a Former Pageant Queen with 5 years of experience.<br>  <br>  Every pageant has slightly different expectations of contestants & also differ in the organization of required competitions.<br>  <br>  I will use National American Miss (<a href="http://www.namiss.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.namiss.com)</a> as an example because this is the pageant with which i am most familiar and it's one of the best pageants to start-out with in the pageantry world.<br>  <br>  You can sign up online by filling out a contestant application. Also on NAM's website you can find sample videos, photos, past winners, testimonials and more.<br>  <br>  For National American Miss there are 3 reqired competition sections. Formal Wear, Interview, & Personal Introduction. There is NO swimsuit competition in National American Miss. There are also a variety of optional competitions including: runway modeling, photogenic, talent, spokesmodel (writing and performing  a speech), acting, & several others.<br>  <br>  After applying and being accepted, you will begin to receive magazines & brochures which give you all the details: rules, tips, suggestions, etc that you need to know.<br>  <br>  Please note that pageants are NOT cheap. You must purchase a formal gown, business suit, other wardrobe; You must also pay sponsorship fees, etc.<br>  <br>  The pageant happens over a course of 2 or 3 days. Here is a typical schedule.<br>  <br>  Day 1 (optional):  Early check in. Pageant Workshop (highly suggested for new contestants). Contestant "Get Acquainted" Party.<br>  <br>  Day 2: Regular Check in. Optional competitions & rehearsals during the day, Formal Wear competition at night.<br>  <br>  Day 3: Interview early in the morning, rehearsals, Personal Introduction in early afternoon, and Pageant Finale at night.<br>  <br>  It can be a rough schedule, but you'll be so filled with nervous energy that you should get through it fine (your parents might be collapsing though).<br>  <br>  There are a panel of judges (usually about 8) that will judge the required competitions. There is a seperate panel for the optional contests.<br>  <br>  Required Competitions:<br>  <br>  Formal Wear -  You appear on stage in front of the judges & audience with your escort. You leave your escort and walk around on the stage (you will be taught what you need to do). You then exit.<br>  <br>  Personal Introduction -  You wear your business suit and appear onstage again in front of the judges & audience. You tell a little about yourself which must include name, hometown, & ambition.<br>  <br>  Interview -  You meet with each judge, one-on-one in a conference room. You only have about 30 seconds with each judge. They have about time to ask 1 question. They will not be "fact" questions like "who are your state senators". Instead they will be open-ended questions like : "If your friends could describe you in 3 words, what would they be and why?"<br>  <br>  Pageants ARE worth the work and the money. There are scholarships available, cash prizes, MANY new friendships, and numerous other opportunities.<br>  <br>  Please consider this: if you do not take rejection well, then pageants are probably not for you. Sometimes there are as many as 300 girls competing in one age category. Of 300, about only 30 will be finalists. From these 30 are chosen 4 runner-ups & the queen.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! if you would like more information please feel free to message me.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ggeLEcbGaa	idk|`|rZWEFz4Qaa	i used to be in beauty pagaents when i was little, but i stopped doing them becuase now i model.<br>  but when i was like seven i remember that you had to tell the people what your likes and dislikes were, who you wanted to be when you grow up, you had to look gorgeous and wear TONS of make-up, and you had to show them one of your talents.<br>  it's the same way for teens.<br>  & then you have to prance around the stage and they judge you.<br>  there are usually about 20 girls in a pagaent, so it's really difficult to win.<br>  i think i was third runner up? i can't remember.

kCdISEGqaa	Some states don't issue card permits with pictures on them.  I'm assuming since you are asking if you bring your school ID as well, that your permit doesn't have a photo on it?  If not, the school ID cannot be used as a form of ID.  Anyone could make a fake school ID and use their older sibling's learners permit.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but, you need a legal ID.  Can you get a state ID?|`|WLuEIwp5aa	You just need a state issued ID.

Smai6vb4aa	Wow Stephen, grow up. "volleyball monsters"?? It's not like they had a choice in the height they have now. I am 6'0 and 21. I understand COMPLETELY where you are coming from. (esp. being taller) Unfortunately there's really nothing you can do but it will get better I promise. I always brag I can sneak sweets and junk food and not worry as much because it "stretches out" lol. But yeah you'll be glad you are slimmer. Heck, I even wear heels. I'm not going to be confined to flats for my whole life! It's all about confidence. If people are so superficial that they care about your height... they aren't worth your time.|`|95eIxJpbaa	What's wrong with 5'10"? I'm a 6'1" guy and would not consider that a problem.

Cavz3kAPaa	I wouldn't call it stupid. I'd never get it, because to me, usually it's an unoriginal idea/design, and I think it's important to have some originality in a design. <br>  <br>  That being said, it's also important to have something that is meaningful or represents you. A star sign isn't meaningful to me, but clearly it is to you.<br>  <br>  I think it's great you want to design it yourself! It obviously is something that means alot to you & represents you, so go for it. Not everyone is going to like your tattoo, so the only person you have to impress with it, is yourself!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|ss48BEk5aa	I have mine on my wrist! and my husbands on my other wrist (double meaning though, cause my mom has the same sign as him and my dad is the same sign as me)<br>  <br>  I think it's a cool idea!|`|zYVCJRMXaa	yeah totally fine, its your body, and personally i like zodiac signs especially if you put your own touch on it.|`|8DjbA8ouaa	thats lame. <br>  <br>  just my opinion.|`|b5b620800c8a845f0ef1186fd7605a31aa	yea...ima taurus too n i was wonderin the same thing....but i think it would be a good idea if u feel thats something thats important 2 u|`|559cbd9f1767902b6dff2e2c24c12ba5aa	its only stupid if you think its stupid <br>  if you like it and are completely sure you want it go for it =]|`|833f42dacfef5f5f35fdcc2ff4e88cafaa	i have mine on my wrist as well, and it shouldn't matter what others think. you should get tattooed for yourself.|`|gWSWRUAbaa	I say if it's your own design then go for it...<br>  I strongly disapprove of picking one out of the book... getting a regular sign tattooed is like getting your own name tattooed.. or a pair of glasses if you get any... thats my take on it.. it's kinda weird to get signs like that... are you really that much into astrology?  <br>  <br>  I think a tatt should be more personal than that.. anyone that sees it will know when you were born. The first thought that passed my head when I see sign tatts is wtf?? why would someone do that? minds well put a self pic on their arm..<br>  typically sign tatts are an indication of wanting a tat with out putting much thought into it..<br>  <br>  However, if you were to design it your self then that's cool... I wish I would see tatted signs that looked original like they actually did it.. But how will people actually know it's your design???<br>  <br>  All in all we all have opinions... do what you want and be happy with it.|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	I think that it is awesome to do. I want to do one. I found one that I like.

CkIeCNS4aa	Usually, razor blades include this colored strip to indicate when it is time to switch to a new blade.  If this strip is falling off, I suggest purchasing new razor blades.

a5knHypSaa	Yea I totally have ur same prob. I like Softlips. You can get it at Publix, Walmart,Target, and pretty much anywhere. It makes my lips really soft! Its one of the best I have found cause Carmex and Burts Bee really don't work all that too well for me.|`|ye5O1iFzaa	I personally like softlips the best and it comes in different flavors like cherry, strawberry, and vanilla, and it's cheap. My second recommendation would be Burt's Bees.|`|g0KSiZqbaa	Shell out that $3 for Burt's Bees, just the plain, original kind|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	First, put Vaseline or some other type of petroleum jelly on your lips until they heal. If they flake at all, take a soft, clean toothbrush and slough off the dry skin. Once the lips have healed, try a moisturizing lip balm like Nivea Lipcare (sometimes called Labello), Blistex, or Lypsyl. Stay away from glosses or flavored lip products as they often contain alcohol (a drying agent). While products like Carmex or other medicated balms feel tingly and soothing, they also contain alcohol and can have a drying effect (it's often thought that they will do more good since they are "medicated" - a very common misconception. They are good, but are more for temporary relief of windburn or cold sores). Good luck.|`|muHctmaGaa	This Blistex is the best.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blistex.com/Lip%20Ointment.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.blistex.com/Lip%20Ointment.ht...</a><br>  <br>  The medicated Blistex ointment left mine so soft after they'd bled in the cold weather, though the texture took some getting used to. Generally I find that Burt's Bees in the tin works for regular lips but not when mine are especially cracked. Softlips worked for me for just a few minutes; it felt like it actually made my lips drier.|`|PGKFzElxaa	OK pricey. But I have to have it when my lips are dry. Benefit's Lipscription.<br>  One tube exfoliates your lips. The other is a moisturizer. I have used it for over 5 years. It leaves your lips looking good. When I use it I do not need lipstick.<br>  <br>  I have tried other pricey products. None have worked as well. <br>  I highly recommend the Benefit's brand. Next best is Vaseline.|`|u3LzUskJaa	I use vaseline. Just vaseline.<br>  Get the very tiny version for going out, I got lots of weird stares when people saw me carrying those huge kinds.<br>  I researched, and vaseline is safe, and healed my dry lips.<br>  Only one dollar.|`|3btLY1QCaa	theres a brand called softlips and it works like AWESOME!!!!! its like long ish and skinny ish lol:)|`|kA09uLdsaa	Burt's Bees works the best for me!

51St5GEcaa	I have that problem too! It drives me crazy. You can have the spider veins corrected you know. But if you just want some preventative measure, you could get a tan. That helps some.

I'm just saying if it bothers you that much, but honestly I think you're normal and fine. No one's perfect, just be glad they're veins and not scarring. Either way though they are just physical marks on your body that you shouldn't let affect your confidence and such. Focus on what you like on your body and have fun with it!|`|DQZK3eKfaa	This sounds strange but my mom takes the vitamin Horse Chestnut and its for healthy veins. <br>  And you can try spray tan things on your legs too. My mom does that also and it helps a lot. <br>  Don't tan with the sun or in a bed though, it just causes more damage later on in life. So not worth it!|`|yU2WHyvgaa	It's okay. Everyone has veins! It's no big deal. Honestly. I don't know anyone who thinks having veins are creepy. Everyone has them, some are more visible than others.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	me too, i just avoid the beach.|`|AA10898988	Ah, I know it is hard, but you need to just try to focus on what you DO like about yourself. Everyone has something (or things) they don't like about themselves, believe me...I have a lot of issues. But you have to try to not let it drag you down. <br>  <br>  And if you are worried about if someone will like you, as in a potential mate, well the answer is yes. There is nearly always someone who will love you for who you are. But you need to exude confidence if yourself, otherwise others' will sense that you don't like yourself as much as you should. And therefore, some people will shy away from that lack of confidence. <br>  <br>  Just keep trying. And just so you know, I'm generally not a very optimistic person at all. I'm very cynical and have a realistic view of the world. So I'm not one of those people who think everything is always wonderful, because I realize it is not always that way. So know that I understand where you are coming from, and that I'm in the exact same boat as you are. :)|`|1Z13L9h2aa	If i tell you to not feel bad about yourself, I would be a hypocrite.<br>  Since I was a kid, I had very beautilful, fair-skinned, flawless legs. When i was 14, I accidentally burnt my left leg to 2nd degree burn. I had to undergo some operation but it left a very BIG AND UGLY scar on my left leg. I wanted to have it lasered but my parents dont want to. This is why I became so bitter with life.<br>  I never really tried to just accept things because I dont think I could do that. Im too young to be open for complete acceptance.<br>  Practically and realistically speaking, I guess what could really make us feel good about ourselves is to have skin treatment that would make my skin flawless again, and could make yours vein-free.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|PFm1dI55aa	I have them too.

I know you can have them lasered off, but that's probably expensive.|`|x1CcZBENaa	i think you have varicose vains. their are no cure for that !<br>       and my only advice for you is to wear long jeans!|`|xK75gTz9aa	don't feel bad!. lots of people at your age have them and even younger maybe o.O|`|z6OqBkBGaa	its normal. have u tried certain lotions meant for getting rid of the veins? well not get rid of them but like make them less visible?? we all have our flaws no worries!`|`|rOPOwK5Zaa	eat alot of food and soon u wont beable to see them|`|b1xKiTMDaa	There's nothing you can do about the spider veins, but don't feel bad about simply being able to see the veins! I'm naturally very tan (Filipino) and I can see my veins too. It's normal! We're just not used to seeing them because we're used to airbrushed photos. If it bothers you that much, a fake tan or spray-on tan will disguise the look of the veins.|`|TRmFghQbaa	i have the same problem. ive tryed tanning and that kinda works for a little while....also if your up to putting makeup on it try finding foundation lighter than your skin tone and put a water proof powder on top.<br>  <br>  <br>  should work. =)
ECTPfxJNaa	i absolutly love that song. i am listening to it right now. i think it is about the struggles in life since he is talking about how he found god. It could be about suicide, but not only that, death and depression in general. he could have also been "down" for a part of his life but when he found god, he got his life together...whatever its about, its an awesome song!!!|`|MbFS6XFQaa	idk but I hate that song|`|rMhJceVuaa	it sounds like maybe metaphorically suicide..like emotion wise not literal|`|24cUKZDgaa	sort of, i think it goes deeper than just plain suicide.|`|fGnkmCX5aa	no, its about puppies.<br>  x_x|`|f7bcycfgaa	i think so|`|X52KmH3baa	spell please right and maybe i'll take you seriously|`|TiQcyk5Iaa	im not so sure.i think its more of like a slipping into depression. like idk.<br>  <br>  <br>  "You Found Me" is a tough song for me. Its about the disappointment, the heart ache, the let down that comes with life. Sometimes you’re let down, sometimes you’re the one who lets someone else down. It gets hard to know who you can trust, who you can count on. This song came out of a tough time, and I’m still right in the thick of it. There’s some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and can be overwhelming. It wears on me. It demands so much of my faith to keep believing, keep hoping in the unseen. Sometimes the tunnel has a light at the end, but usually they just look black as night. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."<br>  <br>  ^ thats what isaac slade said in an interview about his lyrics.|`|KuJXcGZTaa	I don't think so; I think it's about death, definitely, but in the music video, someone got into a car wreck, and it's almost like they're saying, "Why didn't you save me, God?" You know? I LOVE that song, by the way!|`|W0kEGRhraa	i think it may have something to do with that. <br>  but, if you look deeper in the song i think it might mean like someone found him from a dark spot in his life and brought him back to normal.<br>  you know what i meann?|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	yes, sadly :( my friend told me who it was about or something, but I forgot i think it was his girl friend. Watch the music video, its sad. I love the Fray. I love the song How to Save a Life.|`|JQlc9vmDaa	maybe,i am not sure|`|s2drWdMkaa	sound slike it too me<br>  or maybe he got drunk and passed out lol idk|`|duvefvbQaa	i dont knoe trty typing it up in youtube and see what u get|`|KoCJRaB9aa	Guess it's not about suicide, but just down feelings.. hope this helps :)|`|OpoETyfoaa	no one really knows but most people think it is about suicide|`|JdIU26aSaa	it sounds like it
Top5YzaVaa	i like the new viva la juicy perfume. i love both Chanel and juicy, but i would go with juicy. i dont like the orginal one, but the viva la juicy is great!|`|Pswqhimoaa	depends on your personal style.<br>  Do you want to be more sophisticated, or more fun and sweet?<br>  chanel is a tad more sophisticated scent, and juicy is a lot more fun =]|`|AX13vUJeaa	Juicy|`|v0tv83ryaa	CHANEL!!!<br>  (: its beeutiful|`|24cUKZDgaa	chanel, its classic.|`|h3ZvvpQraa	I <3 Chance ,<br>  But get the Juicy becos yu don`t have it yett .|`|gwJDLvUvaa	i would say juicy since you already had the chanel one.|`|de205a22f451377a2a6eceeac8f524a5aa	I wear Chance too.<br>   I also wear Jadore :O)|`|hGUYTMGRaa	I think the Juicy Couture one is better :)

VIP09X1Maa	timetopretend, I have one thing to say to you, and that is...SHUT UP!!! You're friggin' gorgeous the way you are, Savannah, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, especially jerks like timetopretend. They don't know anything. Bullies are just insecure.<br>  <br>  And for you're hair? Highlights, baby!! Try a really edgy color...maybe a short cute cut would be really cool. ;) Tell me how it turns out ;)|`|AA10155619	hi, the best is to go hair shop or parlor.<br>  they knew the latest trend for hair styling and they can treat it the way you wanted.|`|iNXGb3jUaa	Have you thought about getting a body wave perm the curls dont have to be  tight  it looks like you just need a little help with the body in  your hair|`|a3cZhFWlaa	I would just cut it to shoulder length and darken the color to about a blondish brown. then put the  part before the bangs back into a ponytail.|`|uJdkrbdPaa	Straightin it|`|VrR9ojRRaa	I will have to agree with Koda on both points. timetopretend, get the hell off here if your just going to say rude things. I mean, your comment had nothing to do with the question. <br>  <br>  Also, I like highlights. I think you will look really cute and funky with them, but I guess it all depends on what style your going for.|`|K1Ks7Ydyaa	lose weight first.|`|Qkg98XtHaa	Straightin it. Try dying your hair a cute warm bronzy brown color. I think it would look good on you-but if you love your hair then you should just go ahead and scrunch it up with some mousse and pomade it will give you a cute little wavy/curly look. Also try crimping your hair with a crimper it would look cute. People with blonde hair look good with highlights you could try that. Just experiment with different hairstyles and see what works best for you. :) hope this helps you out|`|DgCRryxFaa	I would straighten it and then tease it to get some volume.  I really think it would look good if you cut it short, too!  Then it might have some natural curl.  Oh, btw, I totally love the dress your wearing in one of the pics!  It's fabulous :)|`|zZPEoSngaa	Layers! I have layers and there cute!|`|KAYhVPDQaa	bald
DhUMjZxtaa	You know what...I have it, along with a Nivea one and I still haven't used them yet lol|`|zih1Weanaa	I have never used that one, but I know Dove moisturizer doesnt work for my face.<br>  <br>  I really really like Jergen's gradual glow for face and body. The face one is seriously the only one that keeps my skin clear (weird I know), but since it eventually makes me look orange, I only use it twice a week.<br>  <br>  Just giving some info even though I know this wasnt your questions. :)<br>  <br>  And to use any fake tanner, mix it with regular lotion before adding to knees and elbows or it will look orange and blotchy. Exfoliate the entire area before you apply, as well.

vpkOoQHcaa	I've read in many makeup magazines that brown and all those dark colored eyeshadows make your eyes appear more closed and smaller. However, they also said that if this isn't the look your looking for, than the opposite of course! lol light floral colors such as lightish purple, green, pink (if you like pink on yur eyes lol) or any bright color you can think of. And I think that LIGHTLY using a liquid eyeliner (in black) will make your eyes pop. If you want, just combine the two; so try using the liquid eyeliner and the bright eyeshadow together and see how it works out! Good luck, hope that helped.|`|4GiQnDrLaa	Try using a liter brown. More natural looking. The eye liner try to thin it out more if its liquid then use less if its pencil sharpen it more so you get a finer looking line. Mascara needs to be unclumped my mom uses a toothpick and separates her eyelashes like that, just make sure your very careful not to poke your eye. That wouldn't be good.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	dnt put eyeliner on the top.<br>  use a mascara that makes ur eyelashes really long.<br>  no red lipstick please. use a more nuetral color. like a honeyy color or something.|`|C63XnOOgaa	<a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make-your-eyes-look-bigger" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make...</a>
1hlIzEnTaa	Marcelle makes a really great one, comes in a few different colours, I just use the translucent one though,It's hypo-allergenic, it's about $12 and comes in a 70G container, worth the money!!!  Found at drugstores|`|AA10188961	Avon has a loose powder that is passable.  They also have their own version of the mineral makeup.  <br>  A cheap version that feels pricey is Loreal color match.  I was really happy with that.  <br>  <br>  My very favorite though is bare escentuals mineral veil.  It takes care of any shiny area of your face, is weightless, and feels great.|`|Rg4YOHGhaa	You shy try BB creams instead :)<br>  <br>  The BB Cream, aka Blemish Balm, is the hottest beauty product in Asia right now. It has the advantages of both a makeup and skincare product.

PRzmwFfgaa	No.  Please don't do it.  I think white women look terrible when they get their hair braided like this.  People usually make fun of them.  Especially when they do something like go to an island and come back with their hair braided.  Please don't do this.  Also, yes it is expensive.  This is because in African-American hair it lasts for months.  But because hair in white people is so much thinner and tends to get oily faster, they will slide out of your hair long before then, so you would definitely be wasting your money.  I would suggest you not do it.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	NOOOO!!!!<br>  African american women look ok with it, they are funky enough to get away with it! I dont like the look much though..<br>  White women, i've always thought they look like theyre trying too hard when they have them and it doesnt look attractive.<br>  Plus all the chavvy girls round here have them...so...|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	Generally, I say no...for the most part they look ridiculous! You could try it and see how it looks, but it is a lot of money to spend if it doesn't look good!|`|syIp6d2Naa	It depends on your facial structure and the way you carry yourself. I have friends that wear them and shouldn't and they are black. One way to get an idea is braid your own hair and don't look at it a being short look to see if you have a well shaped head and that you don't look moon faced. (a very round face). My daughter (half black), son-in-law, and step-granddaughter (both full black) all wear them. They make my son-in-law look younger than he is (a good thing), my daughter just now forty and S-G-D (step etc) is in her mid twenties and both of them carries themselves so well they could shave their heads and look great. (I'd look like a lumpy moon lol) My daughter has hers done but does her husband and step daughters and none need weaves. My daughters hair is almost to her waist, my S-I-L and S-G-D are both below the shoulders in braids. I wear braids but not micro braids, I most of the time I wear the traditional Native American braids in honor of my heritage. I have no idea how much weaves cost but I believe they are rather expensive and yet if you want it done right it will cost you. I know they last about a month with them but by the end of the third week are showing wear. It is very necessary to wear a scarf or something to protect it at night as white hair will show the wear faster if it rubs against the pillow at night. Also white hair is more likely to crawl loose and react bad to wind etc. But, the only way to really know is to go for it. Bo Derick (spelling?) looked good in them years ago, but she would have looked pretty good in a sack.|`|9VaWal2Daa	I think one or two can be a sexy look,  but let's put it this way.........even Bo Derek in the Movie "10"........didn't reallllllllllllly pull the look off.   Sure, she looked GOOD, but the braids didn't really work on her either.  I think one or two on white woman,  mixed in with their regular hair works best,   Just my humble opinion.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	no, sorry it won't, micro braids don't even look good on African American women. Don't do it!|`|Cil79o9Zaa	it looks ok.  not that pretty but ok.<br>  <br>  it will last more then a month if u take care of it well, but trust me it'll last a while|`|I2gat01haa	oh god.<br>  sorry but no.<br>  its just so unappealing.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i dont think white women look good in them. but to each their own, good luck =]|`|4a2VzINCaa	no your white . you will never be cool.  it lasts forever. u cant be black, so therefore are not cool|`|R5LuKSUXaa	no.|`|diAqosiIaa	NO!!!! why do people always.....nevermind i hate posers!!!!! why would you want micro braids??|`|DRZMb7HPaa	Hey I have almost the same question posted up.

It really don't|`|qb9V9syNaa	NO!|`|0lnamekJaa	I have very curly, red hair and micro braids happen to look nice on me... But as with any hair style, it is more about the face of the person then the skin color...<br>  <br>  Just like not all guys can pull off shaving their head... Not all chicks can wear micro braids.<br>  <br>  I did mine myself... The back is hard, but if you have a friend to help you can get it done fine on your own... <br>  <br>  You get tiny rubber bands from the dental section of your local pharmacy. <br>  <br>  Get rubber bands for braces.

HIwJFtNlaa	Cetaphil is great, my brother uses it and he has really bad eczema.  I have eczema but I don't use it much because i can control it pretty well. But maybe you can sleep with a humidifier and wash with Aveeno, it's very gentle. Other than that, Cetaphil is a great choice, my brother's dermatologist recommended it|`|gwJDLvUvaa	i say cetephil. i use it because my doctor prescribed it. it has no scent and it works well. after you wash your face with the cetephil, you should apply some aveeno lotion|`|HQFUnslhaa	For moisturizer try Aveeno. That never iritates my skin.|`|9e11a8bfdb68534bad7a82a7d59ef55aaa	orgins.  all natural.... look them up orgins.com|`|Ndw34J0daa	I'm pregnant and recently had to change all my products because of new-found irritation. I've been using Cetaphil cleanser and Beauty Without Cruelty Moisturizer. I find them both to be gently and the cream doesn't make my combination skin oily. I also have dermatitis which is similar to the eczema without the redness and neither of these products have upset that.

Trust me, just put a little of it on at first and see if you like it and it's the coverage you need. If you want to keep layering it, however, go a little step at a time (a song, lol) and keep putting the powder on until you think your good to go. Hope that helps, and also hope you find what your looking for! :)|`|REphi728aa	ive tryed it its very cheap and caky looking...do not recomend it.... i use bare minerals and it works really good or almay if you dont want to spend a lot<br>  <br>  lizzy is lieing she just wants you to buy it so she isnt the only one hu fell for their scam|`|AWc52vOMaa	Maybelline mineral powder is amazingg.<br>  I use it and it isn't cakey at all.<br>  The powder is just like a dream come true and it makes my skin look flawless|`|eqyXyNN9aa	omg, <br>  Covergirl Clean Pressed Powder<br>  is amazing.<br>  it dosent clog pores, and it looks very fresh and natural.<br>  thats the only powder i buy.<br>  its good because you can use it with a brush, like after you put on your makeup, and also you can carry it around in your purse because it comes with its own little pad thing to put it on. plus it has a mirror!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.ca/en_ca/products/product.php?productId=clean_fragrance_free_pressed_powder" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.ca/en_ca/products/p...</a>
9nHFjH55aa	i got mine done yesterday, it's my favorite piercing and i was really surprised how much it didn't hurt.<br>  to answer your question, you should get a q-tip wet with warm water and gently clean around the piercing, then you can put soap on the q-tip and do the same thing. **best soap to use is dial** don't worry about the dried blood, that will go away with more cleanings.<br>  after about a week of cleaning it with soap and q-tips, you can switch to sea salt cleanings (like H2ocean) still using warm water. <br>  make sure after all cleanings that you rinse the piercing completely free of all soap or sea salt solution. <br>  then you should be free to go<br>  <br>  <br>  im sure you know but make sure you dont touch the piercing  unless you're cleaning it. if you bother it constantly, it has a high risk of getting infected and any cartilage piercing infection is not fun.<br>  <br>  it should heal really fast like maybe at most 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! :D|`|d5967bf44111d663a7219ab16d6eb17faa	my advice would be not to touch it considering it's in a very sensitive state right now.<br>  <br>  give it 24 hours, THEN mess with it, but clean ure hands first.|`|20AIgRX7aa	wait.  just let it breathe for the night.  it still has antibiotic on it from the piercing itself|`|C3aviMmyaa	If the dried blood is there now, then you need to clean it off. Just put saline solution on a q-tip. <br>  <br>  If you are talking about any dried blood that you see in the morning, well clean it the same way, but don't mess with it tonight.|`|nqOGoFAKaa	just leave it for tonight. <br>  make sure your soap is non-scented and antibacterial.<br>  you can clean the dried blood off with a damp q-tip.<br>  make sure you do the saltwater soak twice a day, and use the soap once a day.
Pswqhimoaa	there really isn't any explanation that i can tell you the definite answer...<br>  but it really is just human nature. Many people think that very beautiful people are stuck up, since it's their insecurities. "Oh, they're pretty on the outside, so they HAVE to be ugly on the inside" or, "That guy just looked at her, she's PROBABLY a whore." and sometimes even, "that girl has something I DONT have... she must be really ugly inside"<br>  <br>  They say that to themselves to make them feel better. It's something that people can't help, its just kind of natural.<br>  <br>  edit : also many, many people, take being quiet and shy as being self-centered. They believe that you think that you are too good to talk to them,|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Well you sound quite up on yourself to me.<br>  And I don't see why you think people are intimidated to speak to you, you seem to be jumping the gun a bit.

iHna2K7Gaa	I would focus on brushes and eyeshadow to begin with. Their other cosmetics are good, but it's the eyeshadow they're really known for. You can find blush, lipstick, foundation and all that are just as good somewhere else for cheaper. Shroom is a good highlight color; it's a necessity! If you're wanting a black eyeshadow for smokey eyes or anything else, Carbon is the best. If you want to save money, look into buying the eyeshadow depots. They're cheaper since they don't come in the individual containers, and then you can buy the MAC palettes online.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|ND4wPcQkaa	i would start out with brushes and a variety of eyeshadows and build up from there. Also maybe a few blushes. Once you start out with a few basic items and colors, you'll find that it's not hard to keep expanding!!

I use their mineralize bronzer in So Ceylon. they can help you depending on your skin tone. i also use a very light weight powder they make called Studio Finish.its very light weight, but they have heavier stuff too if that's what you like. the only brushes from them i like the best compared to other companies is brush 266 (eyeliner brush) and their eyeshadow brush (i dk the number, it rubbed off.) Their brushes are awesome though, but pricey. Also i love all of their eyeshadows and use darker ones as eyeliner as well. (just wet the tip of the eyeliner brush and use as eyeliner) their eyeliners are nice but tend to rub off. they have little pots of eyeliner too.. i dk i love mac, i guess just start out with a couple stuff and it'll build as the years go on.. its a little pricey but my stuff lasts so long and i always love it so feel its worth it.|`|xqIu84S4aa	all the mac products and brushes|`|GBOgsAoDaa	you need money first of all. if you dnt get a job:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i  helped:P|`|v0FlUan0aa	all the eye shadows, a variety of blushes, eye liners, powders, etc.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	You need to get a hold of someone who will help you with that.<br>  stop at a store that sells mac like mac, or macy's.<br>  they will tell you EVERYTHING you need to know.

pcEJMHPMaa	Don't wash every day and trim every month for split ends.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try and include a few of these food in your diet to make your hair grow fast. Essential fatty acids are found in oily fish such as salmon and tuna, flaxseed oil, sunflower oil, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds. Mushrooms and cauliflower for Vitamin B. Oranges and tomatoes for Vitamin C. Olive oil, wheatgerm and Vitamin E. Try <a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a>  for more remedies and details.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	My advice is to make sure you trim your hair every few months (I go in every 4-5) so split ends don't kill your hair, eat healthy and take vitamins, massage your scalp once a day. It will get the blood moving in your head which may not speed up the process, but it will keep it growing. Finally, keep your hair clean, but not too clean. Gradually work your way down so you're only washing your hair every other day.|`|JQlc9vmDaa	The subject I want to discuss today is a question that is often asked and seems to concern many women. It usually comes in two forms; “My hair doesn’t get any longer.” and “How can I make my hair grow faster?”<br>  <br>  I’m sorry to say that, despite numerous advertising campaigns, there are no magic ointments or quick fix treatments that will make your hair grow faster. The average growth rate is one half inch per month. Sometimes hair does not seem to get longer because the ends are breaking off, making it appear not only, not to grow but even to get shorter. There isn’t anything you can do to increase that, however you can take certain measures to keep your hair as strong as possible. <br>  <br>  Let me explain.<br>  The longer your hair is, the ‘older’ the ends of it are. Everyday, wear and tear, such as sun, wind, blow drying, curling irons and other heat styling tools, even shampooing and brushing, all work together to gradually erode each hair. This eventually causes split ends that will, in turn, result in the hair breaking off. <br>  <br>  The first step is prevention. Care for your hair as you would any valuable possession. Use a mild shampoo that is recommended for your hair type, such as: oily hair, dry hair, color treated, etc. If you are unsure, seek the advice of a hairdresser. I suggest using a conditioner after every shampoo; again, one that is formulated for your hair type. The conditioner will soften the hair and reduce the amount of wear causing friction between hair strands. Reduce the amount of heat styling you do. Whenever possible, let your hair dry naturally.<br>  <br>  Finally, get regular trims. If you are striving for longer hair, see your hairdresser at least every ten to twelve weeks to have one quarter to one half inch trimmed. This will get rid of any budding split ends while, at the same time, allowing for growth.|`|UQkgk7ffaa	use redken real control after you shower<br>  try not to shampoo EVERYDAY but if you have to<br>  then its ok <br>  apply the redken real control to the roots of your hair<br>  then finish styling with a leave in conditioner<br>  *do not rinse out redken<br>  in about 3-4 months it will have significantly grown, mine has!<br>  good luck! =)|`|zih1Weanaa	You cant make hair grow faster, unless you want to take prenatal pills.<br>  Hair is the way it is, and some people's hair wont even grow past a certain length. Just keep the split ends off so it doesnt split and damage it all.

losfOBy8aa	Blow dry hair when wet; the sooner you do it after you get out of the shower, the better the results.  Make sure it's completely dry.  Be sure to brush it while you are drying it to "brush out" some curl.  I spray a little hairspray (Aussie), then part my hair into four sections.  I take my straightening iron (Hot Tools ceramic) and go over once inch sections of my hair.  Then, I will usually spray some more hairspray on my brush and run it through my hair a few times.  Then, I add a gloss, such as ProClaim or BioSilk.  ProClaim is much less expensive.

9QF6GGyiaa	I suggest Sally Hansen. Also what really helps me avoid streaking is I buy the spray AND the lotion. I first apply the lotion and rub in all over. Don't put the lotion directly on your knees or elbows. Then once the lotion is dry spray the tanner and let it dry without anything touching it. It helps me a lot because the spray gets the places the lotion didn't without making other spots look darker. Hope this helps. =)

UBXkJM3Waa	you stab it with a knife.|`|pE8oQTWgaa	I buy the lorel 9.99 dye. I do it myself since I can't afford to go to the salon these days. It definitely takes time, because you want to get all the hair, and even if you think you did, you might have missed some pieces in the back. I think if you do decide to do it yourself, have another person help you, then they can tell you if you missed a spot. The directions in the box are simple, you just mix the stuff they give you and lather it on, wait 25 minutes, then wash it out. Put on an old shirt so you won't worry about a mess.|`|6qljYOO2aa	The directions are in the box with the dye.<br>  Or you can do it my way... the lazy way... and have a salon do it for $40-$60. :]|`|32AzD1Olaa	Dont. if you know u are going to be a mess.<br>  Try to go to a hair salon...they know what they are doing.<br>  <br>  If not...Put bags all over the floor before you start.

The darker the color the thinner your thighs will look.|`|LlaLuDvlaa	Well I can't really suggest shoes other than heels to make you look taller.<br>  If you wear a long, loose-fitting blouse type of shirt, it will draw more attention to your midsection and not your thighs.|`|mQmlqky1aa	Bright skinny jeans usually have that affect on woman's thighs... trust me, I have the same problem and I'm the size of a stick.But, just wear them if you like them.

xXGn1zfsaa	It's shaped a little like an upside down "T".<br>  It is done by the piercer taking a needle and making a little pocket in which they can insert the anchor. <br>  Once the pocket is made, they insert one end of the anchor under the skin and (this is where it gets a little painful/tricky) maneuvers the anchor around until the other end can pop in as well.<br>  After that, the "T" is upside down, with the base pole sticking straight up. The piercer then attaches/screws in the jewelry to the hollow end (usually a jewel, sometimes just a flat head, etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helped :)

HQFUnslhaa	I use Biore deep cleansing pore strips.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Biore pads work excellently.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	Blackheads are not dirt.  They are composed of body oils that have oxidized and turned dark on contact with the air. <br>  <br>  Look up "comedo extractor" on Google.com Advanced Search.  This is a small instrument with a little loop about the size of the letter "O" on a page.  When the loop is pressed down around the blackhead, it exposes the dark top layer enough so it can be removed without squeezing or injuring the pore.<br>  <br>  Skin care salons have estheticians who are experts at doing this.  If you can, have it done professionally, at least for the first time.  Don't ever squeeze your own, as you can easily form a permanent scar. <br>  <br>  There are also oatmeal scrubs which have a very gentle abrasive action.

But the way to go is go to a shop and ask how they work with apprenticeships for tattooing, such as ages and what they do for that shop.<br>  You can look up what they do on google to learn some on a typical apprenticeship but all shops are slightly different.|`|slppTZi1aa	Im glad you aked this. I knew there was no designated tattoo college, but i also want to be a tattoo artist. Im sixteen and have been building up my collection of work for a little over a year.

I got really discouraged lately and decided id go to medical school and recently becoming an artist has been on my mind like crazy, i just dont know if im good enough so i have medical school as a fallback because i do really good in school. Im very artistic too but i just dont know, i have to figure it out soon though haha. I hope you become an artist that would be sick. You should post pictures of your work and see what people think.. I wanna see too!|`|nXloT3Iiaa	You have to be over the age of 18 to be a tattooist for health and safe practice codes. It is best if you gather a folio of all your art pieces and take it to tattoo shops.
iHna2K7Gaa	You look like a really chill person, thus probably awesome to hang out with. I would guess that you like being comfortable, you don't really care what people think about you, and I wouldn't take you for being super-super-girly. You're apparently one of those few girls who look absolutely gorgeous, even when you're just wearing a T-shirt and have your hair thrown up. I'm jealous, haha.<br>  <br>  As for the haircut, I think it would look great. It's a really cute cut, and it's very different. Just be sure that you always style it so that it has a lot of volume! That's what makes this cut looking so great.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|OXhe1JH3aa	Yes, but maybe not such bold layers.<br>  Have the hairstylists blend the layers in front a littllle bit more, and you shall look fine!|`|SouPhkgxaa	Your really pretty(:<br>  <br>  And i think it would. =]|`|QAQHJFI9aa	I probably wouldn't take much notice, but you look pretty, and that haircut would fit you perfectly!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	"Young.

Hope this helps!|`|1Ec5Ntw7aa	A white shirt would be nice. :) White or pink or blue to make the design on it stand out. :)|`|SUG8wXmUaa	Yellow|`|bf3ikOv8aa	match it with a top of a colour of the smallest or medium size detail on the skirt. also white matches well too, but black on the top can be too overpowering, so stick to lighter colours on the top. bold colours on the bottom|`|Fi0babtOaa	yellow and purple are complementary which are across from each other on the color-wheel.so dark purple and yellow will definitely match.|`|vsDbgfp1aa	A beautiful Turquoise will complement the pink and the deeper shade of maroon purple!|`|iPje1iyGaa	White, grey, the pink or blue found in the skirt, black|`|oHKpy4IRaa	Black, white, gray and other shades of purple|`|RLi3iFXlaa	if it has pink in it .. pink|`|WW66AkgJaa	black.|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	white top
KuJXcGZTaa	Get some kind of moisturizing shampoo. And if you don't like using gel, then don't use gel! Who says you have to? Don't let them make you think you're not cool; only you can make yourself feel uncool.|`|vGtM2F5Caa	try a little bit of gel<br>  or hairspray that makes your hair hard
Dvkfd8j8aa	you should make them where nice khaki slacks with a matching color(to the bridesmaid dresses) button up short sleeve shirt :)<br>   its still nice but relaxed along with your bridesmaids!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck on your wedding!|`|okZ3KuBdaa	are you having a summer party and they are gonna where sundresses  then the guys should also where them LOL . no but maybe they should where some conservitive shorts and a dress shirt|`|wnPqeJoWaa	beautiful things spring colors very light|`|OpoETyfoaa	khaki pants " pressed" and button up shirts with ties.|`|tBaCFTtBaa	my bridesmaids wore sundresses and the groomsmen still wore tuxes with matching colors.. our colors were lilac and pale yellow..  it was beautiful.  good luck!|`|qoRFXZqFaa	I would say a nice button down shirt that is the same or close to the color of the dresses unless they are pink. Also som nice light colored slacks would look great!|`|iPje1iyGaa	Maybe just a button down with some nice slacks, and possibly a tie.|`|WmcU01D7aa	Light colored, light weight fabric, suits, with neckties, not bowties.
9lVjWPGqaa	u can take it in ur makeup bag, but if u have liquids they must be 3oz n fit in a ziploc bag<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|AA11311675	Yes, you can bring make up on board. Just make sure all of your make up is 3 ounces or under and place it all in a small baggie (sandwich size), it'll be easier going through security.|`|4GiQnDrLaa	You must have it in a clear bag so that when they inspect your stuff they don't think that your taking something you're not supposed to. Powder, and pencils are fine liquid has to be no more than 3 oz. Or they will take it. If you do take make-up removal put it in a small clear container that doesn't go over the limite and you'll be fine. Or when you get to hawaii just buy some make-up removal there.|`|u3LzUskJaa	When  I was going out of US they took away my eye makeup remover because it was too big..<br>  Your makeup has to be in a ziplock bag, liquid that is.<br>  I think it's fine for your makeup if it's powder.|`|8HtWiZKiaa	i put all of my makeup in a clear zip loc bag and i had no problems

Go for it! The style is very chic and it would fit your completion well. I know how you feel about hair salons because I feel the same way! I always get everyones opinion before i go to get it cut! The layers and angles will look great with your head shape and tone. If your willing to make a big change, I think a bob cut with a side bang would also look great. Good luck with everything!|`|WmcU01D7aa	Eh. You'll end up looking like ever other piece of scene trash out there.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should start with something small, like some cute side bangs and and few flippy layers, and then just go from there. Maybe some highlights and lowlights, but don't change your color too dramatically, it looks so pretty.|`|m3KC6M8daa	OMG OMG OMG it is too cute, im sure you'll luv wat you get, wat i always like to say is try any new hair style and the majority of the time it will look good and if it doesnt it will grow back|`|Ia7nddGhaa	Sometimes those looks only look good for certain girls.

Who are you trying to please by getting darker skin? Accept yourself.|`|Pswqhimoaa	Don't fall into the trap where society thinks you have to have pre-cancerous looking skin, or dye your skin brown.<br>  You look like you fell into a pile of poo.<br>  Pale skin is very lovely.

Ever so often I'd get rude comments about being pale, too. As I became older, however, the comments have slowly come to a complete halt.  <br>  <br>  Because you know what? That guy was an idiot. He was a shallow fool who thought you had to be blue-eyed, beach-blonde, and tan to be considered "hot". I think pale skin is gorgeous. My mom always told me that being pale was a sign of beauty. :] I agree. It looks clear and clean kind of movie-starish, in a way. Plus, did you know that the more tan your skin is, the more wrinkles you'll have when you're older? So while all your friends are tanning-away you'll still look 25 by the time you're 40. :D So when you're older pale skin will help you look younger, which I'm sure will come in handy. ;]<br>  <br>  And here's a shirt I suggest buying and showing off to those jerks at school:<br>  <a href="http://www.thisnext.com/item/62E6C43F/2815EAD6/Pale-is-the-New-Tan-Casper-Tee" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisnext.com/item/62E6C43F/28...</a><br>  Ha!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. The teasing will stop, believe me. Just ignore them. :]|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	Because you have pale skin I suggest you DO NOT go tanning.<br>  If you do you will have a very high risk of getting skin cancer when you're older.<br>  I have very white skin too, and I used to hate it, but now I've embraced it and absolutely love it.<br>  Pale skin is beautiful, we can look like porcelain dolls while others could never.<br>  I suppose if you REALLY REALLY REALLY want to be darker you can get a spray tan, but those ALWAYS look fake.<br>  I say, embrace your skin color, be happy with it, and people will realize that its stupid to make fun of you because you don't care.<br>  I love being as pale as I am, I would never go tanning.|`|zih1Weanaa	Nobody should make fun of you. I am very fair skinned with chocolate brown hair and I love it. I stand out from all of the other fake tanners, and I look natural.<br>  <br>  Maybe the boys make fun of you because they like you. Just add a tiny bit of really light bronzer to your cheeks and chin and forehead, and some lip gloss to add some color to your face.|`|9uAGenc8aa	Maybe you can ask your mom if she'll let you go to the tanning salon and get the spray on tan.  That's safe and all the famous people are doing that now instead of damaging their skin. When you get older you'll appreciate the beauty of having fair skin with dark hair, maybe that's why you get teased by some people, they could just be jealous.|`|dpwMHg8maa	I'm also very light skinned, but i have blond hair, which is a pretty awkward combination.<br>  <br>  Fair skin is in fact beautiful, and i love it. But it's when your so pale you look sickly is when you need to worry. Thats my problem.<br>  <br>  Personally, i use a very light foundation, but use this awesome bronze powder that gives me a healthy sunkissed look.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, you could try talking your mom into spary tanning, or use the tanning lotions.  But if its just for your face, i'd stick with the makeup<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|KDO3OOUqaa	Try some self tanner lotion<br>  dove makes a really good one<br>  i was pretty pale too when i was twelve (im 14)<br>  hope that works out<br>  and if it doesnt <br>  then all you have to say is<br>  that bella in twilight is pale too<br>  or that you were pale before twilight made it cool<br>  :D good luck <br>  and dont let those kids tease you<br>  most of them do it because they are insecure|`|1oqchKA1aa	don't listen to ppl that make fun or say mean things- they're obviously immature. go to the drugstore, target, or beauty section of the grocery store and buy the dove energy glow gradual tanner lotion. im light skinned too and after two days i looked like i had just gotten back from the beach!|`|TiQcyk5Iaa	im 14 and i have dark hair and light skin. really, just worry about your face. put a LITTLLLEEEE bit of bronzer on your cheeks and forehead and i put white eyeshadow just in the corners of my eyes, it'll make you look, not so pasty.|`|9VQfNXj4aa	Accept who you are. When people tease you about being pale, just laugh it off. Better to be pale than to get skin cancer or one of those tacky orange fake tans. When you get a little older, a little blush can add some color to your cheeks.|`|WW66AkgJaa	go to your local drug store and buy instant tan lotion. i tried it..and it works.

But if your looking for a cool change, I'd go with my choice (second to last!)|`|LDfXMfyYaa	who cares? u look damn hot in all ur pics...............|`|eAupvb3taa	I love the highlights. Just be careful. With your skin tone and dark eyes, you'll look like a hooker if you go too light. Keep your dark rich color and go with highlights. Go light at first and then if it's not enough, you can go more streakier next time. Dark hair is tough especially with olive toned skin. It gets boring (I'm a brunette too). Highlights make for a nice change. Worst case, you always can go back dark but have a professional do it so you don't fry your hair. Good luck!|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	You are so pretty the way you are,but if you really want highlights go with the second pic that you liked. Don't get that haircut though because your hair is pretty long and wavy plus your darker hair goes well with your tan and eye color.|`|6qljYOO2aa	Your beautiful! :]<br>  <br>  Hm...<br>  I think you'd look pretty with honey/tannish highlights.<br>  Or maybe the shade of your eyes ^-^|`|IHHGT7Eraa	um... i like the 2nd and 3rd one but i want to make a sugestion. u should get crazzzzzzzy highlites. im planning on getting purple and i think that would look cute on u. by the way i think u r very pretty ?|`|unrdcGkpaa	uhh blondzz<br>  <br>  not red i agree too becouse i am being nice eh?<br>  <br>  <br>  ZzZzZ i thought u had dark black hair ?|`|pX7G7Ujcaa	honestly i like the natural look...its way hotter|`|FW2WRGnjaa	Go subtle.

zwvDITr5aa	Goat cheese and live earthworms will turn your eyes ice blue if you eat 6oz a day for 8 days.|`|jC7C2V6Taa	I don't believe that there are certain foods that change your eye color. However there are certain circumstances such as going out into sunlight which makes your eyes appear a different color. The only thing I know about food changing your eyes is eating carrots were found helpful in improving your eyesight and that'ss about it. Other than that if you want to change your eye color, get contacts. =]|`|L9JfmPkiaa	color contacts is <br>  all i know of i have <br>  REALLY dark ones<br>  on days and i have <br>  purple contacts it looks<br>  really sweet.|`|hGUYTMGRaa	yes, its called contacts|`|WO68RZdIaa	Unless you use colored contacts, there is no other way to change your eye color. The color of your eyes is determined in your DNA, so it's genetic. Until a safe technique is designed to completely alter your DNA structure either in vitro or at some point during your life after you are born, whatever eye color you have you are stuck with.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	Yep! Lots of people do it everyday! The great thing is you can switch between brown and blue whenever you like!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THEY'RE CALLED CONTACTS<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I doubt you can do that. If there WAS a surgery or pill or method for a different eye color, you'd probably go blind in the process
GR2XNzCCaa	Get clarifying shampoo and lather it into your hair and leave it in for a minute while your in the shower. Rinse it with warm water and put conditioner in. This may fade it a bit more than you want though, I'm not sure. I just know all my family members that are older than me have dyed their hair dark, and when they used my shampoo, their hair ended up lighter instantly.|`|xXGn1zfsaa	Sorry love, you're pretty much stuck with the black.<br>  Black does NOT like to fade.. even if it weren't "permanent," it's the toughest color to get out.<br>  Your best bet is going to a professional salon and paying for it to be stripped out. I know it sucks, but I had to do it too :(<br>  Luckily my hair withstood the process, and I have very curly almost African-American type hair which I have dyed constantly over the course of about five years. Just plan on deep-conditioning afterwards. <br>  Good luck!|`|VIP09X1Maa	Look, I got semi-permanent-will-wash-out-in-a-month black dye and IT'S BEEN AN EFFIN YEAR!!!! More than that!!! So believe me, it's gonna be hard. What Saruuhhh (sp?) said, you'll have to get it highlighted out.<br>  <br>  My suggestion? Don't dye it black. Ever ever ever.|`|d1s3KuHJaa	hey sweetie... i colored my hair black a few yrs back and this is what i did to lighten it up. revlon has this hair color just for dark colored hair<br>  (natural or dyed) and it lighted it up a couple shades. hope this helps u out some.
7VjhcEk8aa	No don't continue to shave while you still have those bumps!!!  That will only make matters worse....Just let it heal back up. Once you get healed up next time you shave be sure to make it the last thing you do at the end of a warm shower or bath to soften up the hair follicle making it easier to get a nice clean shave. Then follow these steps...<br>  <br>              Step1: Evenly apply a shaving gel made for the bikini area. Click link for example.  <a href="http://bikinizone.com/shave_gels.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://bikinizone.com/shave_gels.shtml</a><br>  <br>              Step2: Always make sure you are using a new razor..Because a dull razor will not get the job done the 1st time and the more you pass the razor over one are of the skin the more it get irritated resulting in razor bumps.<br>  <br>              Step3:  Always apply and anti bump treatment such as bikini zone after shaving to prevent bumps from ever appearing.  <a href="http://bikinizone.com/bump_busters.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://bikinizone.com/bump_busters.shtml</a>                                         (You can buy all these products at walmart or any local drug store.)|`|cx32RrtYaa	Most people think if you use shaving cream it wont irritate the skin as much, but if you put soap on it before you put on the shaving cream it will make it less irritated. Also once you're done apply deodorant to the area, it will get rid of unsightly razor bumps. Dancers have used deodorant as their secret weapon considering they wear leotards all the time.|`|rsVfcskjaa	yes
TeLdrj9aaa	I don't have my rook, but I have an anti-tragus and lots of other cartilage piercings.  The anti-tragus wasn't too bad.  On a scale of 1-10, it was maybe a 4? The pain of the piercing itself is over pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  As for what ear to get them on, definitely get them on the same ear.  If you're a side sleeper and you have healing piercings on both your ears, it will not be fun.  I had healing cartilage piercings on both ears at one time, and it stunk.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
sP3UtfJ1aa	yes for sure. i got mine done and i was a lifeguard so i asked the guy doing the piercing and he said just give it about 1-2 weeks and it would be fine|`|nqOGoFAKaa	you should wait at least a month or until it's healed to go into a pool.<br>  kids pee in it and it's just dirty, even if you clean it religiously there's still a possibility of infection.<br>  but you should be fine if it's a month away from when you start your job.|`|CpoPZaQTaa	im pretty sure you can.<br>  it might sting a little the first time but then you might get used to it.<br>  but i doubt it will still hurt by june.
rtx0YQDJaa	it sound like your leaking what is called lymph which is normal, it does have an off color oily look about it. it sound like it's become irritated, usually this leaking process stops earlier on but can start again if the area is aggravated. keep it clean... as in use some warm water to clean the area when it's leaking but do this as little as possible because you don't want to cause further irritation. otherwise keep caring for it as normal. it does not seem infected, if it were you would know without a doubt. it would be pussing yellow and scabbing heavily not to mention it would be extremely painful and enflamed.|`|clInlnIqaa	I had the same issue with my wrist tattoo. Usually a tattoo will ooze ink and stuff for the first few days, that's normal. My tattoo did the same thing you are describing and it looks fine. If it was infected it would be oozing a yellowish pus, it would be red, and very hot to the touch. Not to mention it would be tender and painful.
2oN7WrVKaa	Massage your scalp with your fingertips while you take a bath, just submerge your head under the water.<br>  <br>  Try taking fish oil pills, they hold some protien that will promote hair growth. Other vitamins and minerals that are believed to contribute to hair growth are: biotin, beta-carotene, biosil, B complexes, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, silica, nettle, and flaxseed oil.<br>  <br>  Do not over brush your hair and NEVER use a bristled brush, as this will tear and damage your hair. Not to mention it doesn't feel very nice!!<br>  The 100 strokes a day is not helping your hair!<br>  <br>  Avoid excessively hot water as well as blow dryers and curling irons, and dont over wash your hair.<br>  <br>  Another tip to try is to eat a square of jelly everday. The gelatine in it encourages both your hair and nails to grow.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helped.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Rub olive oil into the scalp and massage to promote hair growth , leave for 1 hour and wash.

There is no fee if you don't place an order, but they like you to at least order brochures, even if you don't have any products to order.<br>  <br>  Sliding scale:<br>  $0-$24: 0%<br>  $25-$144: 20%<br>  $145-$284: 30%<br>  $285-$424: 35%<br>  $425-$899: 40%<br>  $900-$1549: 45%<br>  $1550 and above: 50%<br>  <br>  ETA: e-mail me if you have any other questions.

PO1QrClpaa	I can help you with this one lol. I had my navel pierced and it didn't hurt at all. I just felt the needle pierce the skin and then that was it but my piercer says that it's different for everyone. My advice would be to have a good nights rest the night before and eat a good breakfast. Try to relax because my piercer says that the more you work up your nerves, your blood rushes and it's more likely it will bleed. Also and this is really important do not drink alcohol or take pain killers before you go, this causes the blood to thin and may lead to excessive bleeding. Other than that have fun and take care of it. Oh and i got to choose my own navel ring they usually have a variety but not everyone does it.|`|zmjAccMFaa	No it does not hurt, just a quick pinch and it is over with before you know it.<br>  It takes only a few seconds to get it actually pierced.

0lnamekJaa	I just read an article in some chick mag about how you need to apply moose when your hair is damp and then blow dry it so that the moose 'melts' and coats each strand for natural hold.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you did it but that trick may help...<br>  <br>  You need a stronger hold gel... <br>  <br>  I would go talk to a stylest and see what they say after looking your hair over.|`|eNzOnSxNaa	you might be like me....i have reallly curly hair and when i straighten it, it doesnt stay straight because my hair is just too curly.<br>  your hair might just be too straight.<br>  and if thats not the case, maybe you have a bad curling iron. consider buying a better one. like at www.folica.com<br>  or just buy a hair product on that website for curling hair.<br>  <br>  i recently got a flat iron on there and my hair looks muchhhh better now. :)|`|ynBjE9YVaa	my friends hair is the same way but when it comes to hair i can do miracles. first don't put conditioner on the day before you curl your hair then brush your hair thoroughly then part it then on each section put hair mousse on all of that section then take the curler a little less then half way down your hair then start there and slowly release your grip a little so the curler will move down then tighten the curler up again until your done the curls come out perfect.

jWmnSXlLaa	I started to use face primer today for the first time. I used the one from Avon. It really seemed to work. I have heard colorstay liquid eyeliner doesnt rub off easy.<br>  <a href="http://kiki072895.tripod.com/blog/avonmag.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kiki072895.tripod.com/blog/avonma...</a>|`|1hlIzEnTaa	for your foundation use a primer underneath, there's also eye primers out there to keep your eyeshadow in place longer, as for the eyeliner, check out "GOSH" cosmetics, they have liquid eyeliners that are semi permanent, in amazing colours! although they come off easily when you use remover, but it is nearly impossible to smudge it or for it to fade for hours! their whole line is great! oh yeah, they make primers too!  hope this helps!|`|UBXkJM3Waa	it's a little more pricier than drugstore eyeliner, but you should really try MAC Liquidlast Liner. i swear, this stuff will not come off during the day. i used to wear it when we did swimming at school, it never ever budged! seriously, try it.|`|u3LzUskJaa	You need to check if your eyeliner says in its package that it lasts very long.<br>  Some high end makeup products are long lasting.|`|5ab8d00f021e6d4fb9829092c30e8c18aa	liquid eyeliner, water proof :)
fdNo9Flbaa	Use mayonnaise instead of a traditional conditioner.  leave it on for about 1/2 a day and wash your hair and use regular conditioner.  Be shiny soft silky and the color of your hair will be so bright and healthy!  Do it for two-three weeks and it will be super healthy even it may grow an inch or two!|`|IX9znFLAaa	If it is really damaged, you need to have a good hair cut.  You cannot repair damage hair.  The treatments that claim to do so are only hiding the problem and over time your hair will get worse.  Stop blow drying, straightening, and iron curling you hair.  <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a one night spruce up, try a mixture of mayonnaise, a bit of avocado, and a few drops of olive oil.  Leave in for 3-5 mins and rinse.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myhomeremedies.com/static/hair-care.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhomeremedies.com/static/hai...</a>|`|3Yc3kfoEaa	use an avocado hair mask! =D<br>  it worked really good for me.<br>  watch this:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0kvwQYHZYQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0kvwQYHZ...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps sweetie!|`|DVwSammQaa	Coconut oil.

Top5YzaVaa	that dress is amazing! its really pretty! i love it! it would look fabulous on you. i might even get one of those for me. haha jk|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It's a really cute dress. You can have a tailor or seamstress alter the neck strap so that instead of tying it fixes with a button. Most dry cleaners have tailoring and that would be a pretty easy fix.|`|z1gUsqzHaa	That dress is so freakin' cute!!<br>  :D|`|YoRZrKCEaa	i don't like it. but i'm sure it<br>  would look cute it you wore it.|`|eY4RubMSaa	omg, YES.

It's really pretty on the model but I also think it's a good idea to considder i few things.<br>  <br>  1. Will it suit your; skin tone, hair, eyes, body?<br>  2. Is it worth the money?<br>  3. Can you see yourself in it on other occasions?<br>  4. Have you shopped around other places?<br>  5. Is there another dress that you have your eyes on that you would prefer?<br>  6. Does it suit the occasion? (Is black satin right for a sports evening?)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|o9kWtq3Paa	its cute.<br>  get it.<br>  if your double knot it its not easy to yank.<br>  i do that with my bathing suites.<br>  but its a really cute dress.<br>  its a yes for me.|`|F4Hw3YB3aa	I really like the dress.

But if you don't feel comfortable I would not recommend buying, and get something you feel comfortable in.

LiiDOQWqaa	well you go to a store and ask the people that work there if they can measure it to know your size it might be embarrassing but i'd prefer a woman to measure your breasts|`|5oGdBwh5aa	The best way is to go into Victoria Secrets and ask for a free bra measurement.|`|6NPv1TKQaa	Try em all, honey.<br>  Thats how you do it, and if the shoe fits...|`|Y1dzA05jaa	Measure  the circumference of  bust as indicated on  picture on the right at this website.You can calculate your bra size.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etoolsage.com/Calculator/BraSize.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.etoolsage.com/Calculator/BraS...</a>|`|cUGjqS3Uaa	Measure your self, go to any bra store and ask them to measure you, or look up how to measure yourself on google.
oxL8MEKPaa	What's a conch?|`|zmjAccMFaa	Unless your friend is certified and works as a professional piercer I would not risk it.<br>  What do you mean by experienced with piercing?  Getting them or actually doing them.  Either way play it safe and go to someone who really knows what they are doing.<br>  The odds for shattering is depending on how you get it done and for infection how well you take care of it.<br>  You would care and clean it just as any other piercing.  If you go to a professional they will tell you the correct aftercare instructions.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i wouldn't do it<br>  i think you could really get into a mess<br>  but that's just my personal opinion<br>  <br>  i think you should get it pierced if you want to, but spend the money and go somewhere professional<br>  you can still ask that friend to come along, it will still be 'fun' if that's what you are looking for|`|zYVCJRMXaa	unless certified and she has a super clean environment to perform it i wouldnt trust.<br>  <br>  PS shattering is ONLY at risk when a gun is used to pierce the cartilage as long as a needle it used you are safe.<br>  <br>  You clean/care for it with Sea salt solution/soak. Personally recommend for the first 2 months you do soaks meaning have warm water in a small class fill near top, 1/4 teaspoon of salt for every 8 ounces of water. Make sure the salt is SEA SALT non iodize, check boxes they say. put ear in sideways and hold for 5 min then take ear out and dry with paper towel, NO CLOTH they are filled with bacteria and you will give yourself high risk of infection. After 2 months of soaks you could change to just a spray of sea salt solution or keep with soaks for healing.<br>  Always keep hands away from it that are not clean. Happy piercing :)|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Conch piercing needs a really careful placing.  Its much easier to go to a professional to get it done  Especially if you want to reduce your risk of infection.  Just because your friend us experienced with piercings doesnt mean she is a professional.|`|rsVfcskjaa	JUST MAKE SURE SHE DOES IT WITH HER MOUTH BAHAHAHA|`|TprIqGhCaa	Shattering?<br>  As long as everything is properly sterilized and you keep up with cleaning your piercing you should be fine. <br>  To clean it, get some dial soap and wash it 2 or 3 times a day, never touch it while your hands are dirty. Lastly, try to use sea salt and water mixed together on your piercing, that should help with healing it faster.|`|372a2bbf8a8fb343aa612f428f698af4aa	Okay...please, PLEASE tell me your friend is using a needle. A gun will get stuck and shatter the area.<br>  <br>  If she knows what she is doing, she needs alcohol wipes. Wipe the whole area and some around it, to make sure there are no germs. Take the needle and a hollow tube, putting the tube on the other side, while the needle pushes into the tube. Put the ring in the end of the hollow tube, pulling it through. Spray it with an alcohol spray when done and use H2Ocean spray to help it heal. Clean it gently with a Q-Tip and antibacterial soap.<br>  <br>  Really, if she knows what she is doing, then there should be no problem. Good luck!!!|`|sFfyZOJNaa	Is you friend licensed? If not, then don't let your friend do it.
gszWusLXaa	shave it off,the hair will grow back thicker|`|6OkIzEoQaa	olive oil has been proved as the best stuff for thickening eyebrows..:)|`|883f254b6cec16c32fcbcaf858f44c77aa	now the temporary solution is to use the eyebrow pencil but i was suggested by the cosmetologist that castor oil improves the growth of hair since its a little sticky apply it during the night time n do not go for threading unless they become dark...|`|4KpvJUlwaa	Before going to bed apply a good quality <br>  Castor oil on your eyebrows|`|Zv8b4jBZaa	Massage with olive oil helps a lot..<br>  This method can  also be applied for eyelashes..|`|8t8pOSiCaa	apply coconut oil.
QNTfI25vaa	I haven't had that problem, but if you're concerned, I'd put a light coat of Chapstick or other balm on before applying the gloss.|`|DVXypPKgaa	nope lipstick does tho :-)|`|Yue2YKTnaa	i dont think so<br>  i put lipgloss on my lips and it actually made my lips softer more than chapstick|`|u8Ts3Nxbaa	no, it doesn't.. it kinda keeps them moisturize a bit. But wouldn't recommend using it all tha time,. lip gloss is just to make your lips glossy thats all...<br>  <br>  you would like need Burt's Beeswax Lip Balm also, to keep your lips from drying out. I would buy both of them.|`|xqIu84S4aa	no i use it when mine are dry and it actually helps it|`|TprIqGhCaa	That sure doesn't happen to me.|`|jFCsJJoiaa	im pretty sure it doesn't, but I guess it could depend on the brand of lip gloss.|`|CaxL7Znmaa	i don't think so. i think it really helps make your lips softer
iPje1iyGaa	Keep it simple and natural, with brown eyeliner, tan eyeshadow, and mascara.  Pink/peach blush and lips.<br>  <br>  You don't need foundation unless you need to even out your skin tone.|`|EZyHOht7aa	Foundation, bronzer, eyeshadow, blush, mascara.|`|m6GSXW40aa	proably light colors!! Pinks yellows blues and purples. On the lips i would do a nice gloss or little bit of color not much!! or u could just go crazy with it whatever you perfer! It is your baby shower do what u want!! and have fun congrats!|`|3T50lwVhaa	Ya know what  I really think...I am a guy so I DON'T CARE!!!

As far as where to put it...I don't know that is such a personal decision. I have one on my lower back and one on my foot. Though, the ankle or wrist would be pretty for cherry blossoms. It depends how visible you want it to be. Lots of factors to consider. I'm still trying to figure out where to put my next one, myself! Just make sure that you are sure before you get it! Good luck!|`|doVWnwJKaa	you could put it on your ;<br>  <br>  ankle - either side<br>  wrist - inside<br>  or your neck (:|`|u48Wzj3yaa	I'd suggest blooming from the inner wrist, or across the collarbone to about mid-neck. And you should be able to take any picture to your local tattoo artist and tell them you want a single stem with cherry blossoms on it. To be a tattoo artist it is necessary to be an artist first, so they can probably render something to your satisfaction.|`|x9W0Nrjtaa	I think the stem would look nice on the lower back of the neck, or just below it. Placing the tattoo vertically just above the area between the shoulder blades would set it apart from the rest of the body presenting it in a more interesting way.<br>  <br>  As far as finding a decent design i was just looking around online for peoples questions just like this for ideas, if it would be okay with you I'd like to use this one. <br>  <br>  -drew|`|iPje1iyGaa	I think this is really pretty (without the lettering) and you could pretty much put it wherever you want.

phuiDk0Baa	I don't get it, many people are saying you can't get it, or it might not be possible. Your hair is already straight and down, all the stylist has to do is shorten your top front hair that's on your forehead and make it into a short curled bang, then edge the sides. Piece of cake. oh and trust me, that's why we're called stylist, we could make kinky hair look like that lol.|`|CEuuqN62aa	it doesn't look that difficult to do. just print that off and take it in with you and i'm sure they'll make it work, you should try getting a picture that you can see the detail of his hair better though.|`|ayVz0Vzeaa	the one you want is slightly longer. But i think they can pull it off :] that's all i can tell from the pictures. sorry if i'm wrong|`|dnzKHomtaa	yeah just show the picture to them and they can probably do it. <br>  <br>  please skip the goatee though!!!|`|USzDTj00aa	yeah it'll be easy|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	.....ew|`|e8b42803cca27f15ab897dbc4a0227e7aa	Yes, of course. It looks complicated but it's not.<br>  <br>  They just have to give you side bangs and layer your hair. And maybe thin it out, too, in case if it's too thick to pull it off or something.<br>  <br>  :]|`|Qkg98XtHaa	I know exactly what your talking about. A guy friend of mine really wanted a cut like that and his hair was just as long as yours. I think they will be able to pull it off and do it like you want. But if I were you I think you should take more than just one picture and explain how you want it exactly so they dont screw up on you. By the way I think your hair already looks super cute!!!! Lots of chicks love dudes with hair like this including me!!! GO FOR IT YOU"LL END UP GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|hg5I1O2xaa	I think it'd be a do-able cut.<br>  <br>  Just make sure when you explain the picture to the stylist, tell them how you want the sides cut. It's hard for me to explain but give them detail on it. But I think the pic has a good angle.|`|kzWYi5OIaa	Um, you look the same and get a better quality pic in the first one and you're a guy right, sorry i couldnt tell...|`|WmcU01D7aa	It won't be easy. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and you'll look like a total douchenozzle.

First, you have to use a cleanser and stuff for yurh face & clean out all the makeup you were wearingss before; and put yurh finger along the water line or whatever they call it; not above it though but slightly below it and slightly tug it so that yuh wont get premature wrinkles. i find that using a q-tip can sometimes aggravate people and they tend to just try to get it over with and get red blotchy skin under the eye. when yuh do use the eyeliner; always apply the eyeliner first before the mascara because yuh can't draw a fine straight line when the mascara is dried up. Since yuhh already have yurh finger below the waterline & tugging lightly , try to apply the eyeliner using dashes; and then when yuh figure out how to draw a perfect thin line, go over it a few times [dark thin lines look really nice for me; but i dont know about you]. For the top part; its a bit harder but you dont need to really perfect the top because of the mascara that you'll be applying. For the mascara. use a q-tip& sort of lightly tug onto the top of yurh eyelids; yuh can tug at certain positions so that you'll be able to reach all of you're lashes.
ND4wPcQkaa	I can't tell if they are real or not, but i find it funny that a lot of people are saying if it says UGG on the label it must be real. That is actually not true. My mom accidentally bought me a pair of "UGGs" from some website claiming to have discounted UGG boots and they were actually fake. They looked almost identical to real UGGs and the label was pretty much the same but they were slightly different from the UGGs I already had.  Also, i found it to be weird that the packing slip was in Chinese. Then i did my research online and found out that while UGGs are in fact made in China, UGG doesn't allow their products to be sold to the public directly from China. Anyways, sorry I couldn't be a little more help but look at websites that tell you how to spot fake UGGs. They are really helpful.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you should take them to a store that carries UGGs and compare them. Compare the stitching, the fur, and even try both on to see if they feel much different.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	yes.<br>  if they say ugg.<br>  they are real.<br>  if they said ugg and they werent real, the company would get sued and you wouldnt have those shoes.|`|1QpigqCNaa	hmmm... how much did you buy them for?|`|DhUMjZxtaa	I'm not sure.

The fur is supposed to be ultra soft and your fur just looks like the crappy knock off fur from craft stores.|`|54uxZwXqaa	YES they are real you can tell by 2 ways the uggs on your back are spelled with a big U in the middle. and your uggs have the little "R" in a circle which means they are real.trust me i have uggs and they all have the "R".|`|26pU02cDaa	In my opinion, they look real.

jER0X5OPaa	I use Bare Minerals, and it is fantastic. It's very light, and it doesn't clog my pores, so it doesn't make me break out (they don't lie in their ads, I really can sleep in it : ). If minerals are what make you break out, this might not work for you, but after looking at the Every Day Minerals website, it looks like Bare Minerals is more high-end than that brand, so it might be different for you.<br>  <br>  Anywho, it doesn't even look like I'm wearing make-up at all. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing make-up, either, it's so light. It covers my skin very well, but like I said, it doesn't clog my pores. I used to have a huge problem with acne, and this really helped cover it up while I worked towards finding a solution. I think I found a product that works for me (mixing Oxy topical cream with a prescription anointment), but even before I used that, I noticed in a difference in my skin when I stopped using heavy or liquid foundation. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and I hope it's not the minerals that are causing problems with your skin, because Bare Minerals is fantastic.<br>  <br>  => and on a side note, I've heard Aveda has good make-up, but I haven't tried it personally.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|70Z0ddcxaa	my skin is super sensitive <br>  ive used a lots of different makeups <br>  and the best ive found for me is smashbox and m.a.c

Put them in at night when you're hair is wet, then sleep in them(since their sponges they are soft and won't bother you). Then in the morning, unroll and you're ready to go! Quick.  <br>  <br>  When I do this I add a little something, I tease up the top, maybe pull back a strand or two with some bobby pins,for a sort of messy curl look. Takes me about 20 minutes.
wq6lfHIBaa	Well shampoo opens your hair follicles and conditioner closes them, so if you don't condition then your hair will be very dry/dull all the time.  Also i recently found a good deep conditioner....ok first put coconut milk in your hair and let it sit for an hour while you clean the house... then add olive oil to that and let it sit for a half hour, make sure you don't get the olive oil on your roots or you will have a hard time getting the oil out.  Then shampoo your hair twice to get all the coconut milk and olive oil out and condition towel dry and then style the way you normally do...do this once a week and your hair will be so shinny and pretty!|`|0haWIfVMaa	Try to use Biosilk serum, its a great detangler and improves the overall condition of your hair.|`|zih1Weanaa	Your hair is at its most fragile when it is wet. Be sure to use a good conditioner, and when you get out, let it dry for a good while before you brush it...and dont towel dry it. The fibers damage the hair.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to brush it, use a detangler so your brush doesnt damage the hair where the knots are.|`|Dz5c3R0Iaa	mine does that too .. <br>  so what i do ! is leave my condition on for a really long time in there . and then i always put bio silk or CHI spray it will help !|`|DtZHbo7Kaa	never get out of the shower:)|`|jNXrVg9Kaa	what do you mean damaged? u need to comb your hair out with a wide tooth comb

eGA9eCAiaa	there are tons of great alternatives to an actual minnie costume!<br>  1. you could get a red and white polka dotted head band, and put your hair in two high buns like ears. pair that with a red dress and white tights, and then wear red flats with it.<br>  2. do minnie with a twist: use the same head band, and wear a black and white blouse. then, pair it with red skinny jeans and black flats.<br>  3. buy a plain minnie mouse outfit. they have them all over costume stores, and if it not exactly like her, then find a red and white polka dot baby doll dress and do the hair things listed in 1.<br>  <br>  i hope it helps you! ;)|`|XuFmnqSpaa	Wear like a red mini-skirt, and a red polka dotted shirt and mini (not in the mouse way!) heels.

HHL01vDAaa	Try washing your face with rice water <br>  And then using a very light lotion while your skin is wet to keep your skin moist|`|N89HLv92aa	THe best face wash I have used is St. Ives Apricot scrub. You can get it at walmart. Or any apricot face scrub does good. Wash your face every morning and night. Stop eating chocolate and drinking caffinated drinks. That should help some.  Also fill up your sink with really hot water and hold your face over the top of it (not touching the water) and let your face sweat over the heat, then wipe it off. That makes my face feel really clean. One more thing! If you have any of your hair touching your face try to keep it pulled back because the oil off you hair can make your face break out. I use to get zits really bad when I was younger but I grew out of it. Good Luck!|`|mk7O29Puaa	Go to acne.org, the lotions for sale on this site works! I suffered with acne for over 20 years and tried all the popular brands including ProActiv.<br>  The only other thing is taking antibiotics but is not recommended because overuse will make them inaffective. You only need to order the acne lotion, the cleanser and facial lotion are not necessary unless you want to try them. After using for a week, my face cleared up and has stayed clear for 4 months now.

Doesn't strip the hair of its natural oils like herbal essences does. Make sure to condition your hair well and not use too many products or heat. Maybe that's why your hair is "destroyed".

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	The steel was not likely the problem, it was the ring.    Curved barbells are much better for navel piercings as they move around less and don't have to be so big.     You can always ask for titanium if you're worried about the steel, it costs more but reactions to it are very rare.    Gold and silver should not be used in fresh piercings, you're much more likely to have a reaction to those metals than to implant grade steel or titanium|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Some people just cannot have some piercings no matter how much you might want to have it, it all comes down to anatomy. Do not use gold, including what was said above it is also a softer metal and can have tiny nicks and scratches that can harbor bacteria and increase the chances for infection.     I would wait another month before re-piercing just to insure the area is completely healed and go to a very good piercer, be sure to tell them it rejected before so that they can take that into account when they pierce you.|`|zVQFyNfwaa	its possible, that is what i was first pierced with, then it rejected too. but the second time i got it pierced, my piercer put in a surgical plastic type.

4AnOHrAPaa	I notice the teeth. Nice, healthy teeth and a great smile will do wonders for a person. As long as a person is clean and decently groomed, they can be considered attractive in my opinion. Without a good set of teeth, or teeth that are crooked, broken, stained, dirty, missing..etc. it ruins the foundation of your face. But then, I'm biased because I work in a Dental Office....LOL|`|vxDQ9SV7aa	their eyes or their smile|`|Xhivbo6zaa	Their eyes...(sigh deeply)|`|NBXY35zPaa	I see everything all at once. It's not just the eyes, nose, lips, forehead, freckles... It's how it all compliments each other for the entire portrait.|`|o0mwF5kFaa	The eyes, the lips, and then the face in general, shape and bone structure included.    I'm an artist, so I have a particular fixation with the structure of the face, so I can draw different types.  ==|`|sP98NDi5aa	Eyes.|`|W7l1awFPaa	I always notice a lady's eyes first.  I especially want to see if she is giving some attention in my direction.|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	Girls: Eyebrows, hahaha i dont know why =p    Boys: Their Smile and Eyes =D|`|Rk6lqCuXaa	Depends on the person.  usually eys or lips,but really it varies.|`|LXByT1eaaa	I notice the face as a whole. Like when someone has a huge nose and small everything else, I will notice how disproportionate it is.|`|Dqez3FRDaa	Hair.|`|37TBeQXsaa	Eyes  Smile  General Cleanliness|`|7yYo5q8Yaa	their eyes   usually top part of the head so eyes, to eyebrows and forehead.|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	uuum their face|`|5XPLlSvpaa	their lips|`|4fCTqxkIaa	Girls: Usually the eyes to see if their pretty and sparkly and their smile.     And You? What do you notice?|`|iver1TLWaa	their eyes, always the first thing i look at in their face x|`|uQWKSQMzaa	Her smile.|`|HY5K4Yrraa	Their eyes :)|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Eyes.. maybe nose depending on the size I guess.|`|EgbIYBehaa	Eyes and Lips|`|YsAEPYwOaa	Eyes are the first thing because they are what gets my attention and they are the keys to any girls soul and heart.|`|FejlYWMBaa	Smile and whether they have anything obviously unattractive ie acne|`|d3ctyNxRaa	Their nose or their eyes. Mostly their nose though, since I hate my own, I tend to be jealous of everyone else's nice nose's. :)
WrJznoPvaa	Champion.  Like the sports brand. They have them at Target.  I like mine a lot.|`|bL3rzrEYaa	with guys underwear does it really matter?<br>  <br>  Walmart lol.

wXloRCegaa	Whatever you do, don't shake the bottle.  When you shake the bottle you're creating air bubbles!  Instead of shaking, just turn the bottle over and roll in slowly between your hands.  Then, when you apply, do thin coats and wait for them to dry in between.  Also, don't add nail polish remover to you polish of it will be more likely to chip and flake.|`|Ae6bUiRWaa	ethir it is you not shaking the bottle or the polish is messed try somthing like opi|`|2X5bzRXyaa	I always shake the nail polish bottle before applying it. Try that. If this doesn't help, its probably just bad nail polish.|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	bad polish foe sho.|`|paerqxfMaa	You're probably putting a coat on top of a coat that isn't dry yet.  You need to let each coat dry a bit before applying another coat.|`|LO4Lf7zcaa	its bad nail polish. Try adding a little bit of nail polish remover to the polish and shake it up until it is a liquid consistency again. If it still bubbles, clean and file your nails. Apply a clear coat then repaint them. If it still doenst work, its faulty polish.|`|LXByT1eaaa	Either the nail polish is messed up or you're not making sure it's smooth and evened out before it dries.
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	You should only ever wear double flares in lobes that are well healed from your last stretch. The trouble you're having getting them in may be because you're trying too soon.    If you like the look of double flare jewelry (or, like me, are allergic to O rings) you can always buy tunnels with a screw off end. I prefer those (when I'm not wearing circular barbells, which is what I usually wear)    Single flares are fine to wear in fresh stretches, as long as you don't have a problem with the O rings.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I have a flesh plug (Surgical steel) at the moment. And l think that the single flare plugs are much better. But it's whatever suits you!
cjaphGaoaa	Aw, who cares?<br>  <br>  Just put them on. Throw on a military jacket too.<br>  <br>  Heck yes!|`|fQ1qDMaqaa	Haha. I think it would look really cute and unique. You should try it. Make a turquise or green-ish color. No yellow, you'll look like a bumble bee. Pink would gbe cute, too.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. :)|`|JCK4sKfPaa	Totally! I think that would look so cool! I would wear it, but my school has dress code! :-( But anyway . . . . YES!|`|MhzlKnrWaa	I wear that to bed sometimes or just out to the grocery store, but whatever if you don't mind about People judging your style go for it ;)|`|DFbjL5Q5aa	It's different. I think it'd look really odd.|`|6qPFNkyDaa	ugh...gross.<br>  i hope that isn't a new trend or anything is it?|`|AkS0Rgqxaa	Haha, well I've done this for playoff basketball games! It's cute because our colors are navy blue and columbia blue, so I wear navy Jordan basketball shorts with bright blue leggings under them!|`|46oOn3yeaa	no i just think it looks like something a homeless person would wear. and by the way its dumb when people admit there weird, people wont respect you.|`|YUkAiiM7aa	L0L. the bows and tutus sound like me! xP<br>  <br>  well, i wear that to pe sometimes, but i wouldnt wear it regularly... o.O|`|JMEIP6G5aa	who cares what ppl think? personally i wudnt do it but if you think it works then it works, dont be afraid to stand out ;)

Get it done by a pro.  You don't want band aids all over your head.  Anyway it will grow back fast. You might as well do it bald and then grow it into a buzz cut if you do not like it.  I know your parents will not like the look but I don't think they will disown you. It is your hair.  It will get you noticed. Is this what you are seeking?

OBnNGcfHaa	I got 5 of my tattoos in SoCal. I have found that they are more expensive in California then anywhere else. But most things in California are more expensive. What is important is that you like the work so if you find a good artist that is a little more pricey it would be well worth the money spent. Then end up with a crappy tattoo. If your not happy with your work most good artists will do touch ups for free. They don't want you going around saying you got a crappy tattoo at their studio.|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	depends on where u go, how long the artist has been tattooing for...what kind of tattoo u want,...|`|Oa2ntFCEaa	dont get tats, they are a turn off for a lot of ppl. if u r evr on the run, im not saying u r but if ever are then they will be able to id u more easily. waht other person has a tiger on their arm.

L9JfmPkiaa	You should prolly avoid straightening it too much.<br>  But if you do, you can get a protector for it so you're not damaging it.<br>  You should get Silk Essence for before and then After Party by Bed Head for after.<br>  You can braid it, curl it, scrunch it, put it in a bun, side ponytail, half ponytail, messy bun, braided bun, etc.<br>  You can straighten your hair for 4 out of 7 days of the week.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	maybe once a week at  most. <br>  You can braid it, put it up in a half pony tail, put it in a side pony-tail, you can put it in a loose bun.<br>  make sure you have a high quality conditioner to keep it moisturized.|`|GJQ164gHaa	mousse it|`|154dzJ1Faa	Probably once is enough.<br>  <br>  But you should straighten it when you dry it.  Use the blow dryer -- that is what they are for!  It's not the tool but the nut holding it that really does the damage.  If you do it correctly, there is no danger.  And it will stay that way for a couple days, if done properly.<br>  <br>  Really, if all you know to do is put it in a ponytail, what is the reason to have it in the first place?|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	I have bleached hair> I straighten it everyday> My hair is as healthy as can be :)

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    There are several factors that could be contributing to your breakouts. First off, are you acne prone? I found that Proactiv is not very good at getting rid of acne, all it is is benzoyl peroxide. Instead, opt for a acne wash that is aimed at your skin type, i.e. dry, oily, combination (try SkinID or Neutrogena). Make sure you are adequately taking care of your skin:     You should be washing your face with an acne wash before you put makeup on, everyday. If you have oily/combo skin, no matter what foundation or acne treatment you use, you will still get oil build up which causes breakouts. To get rid of oil before putting on makeup, dab a cotton ball with alcohol or another astringent, and pat onto you t-zone. Follow with a very light moisturizer made for oily skin. If you have dry skin, make sure whatever moisturizer you are using doesn't contain oil.     Use a primer. Rimmel makes a decent primer, and it's only about $5 at your local drug store. Primer acts as a barrier between your skin and makeup, helping to stop your skin from absorbing the makeup and thus stopping makeup build up in your pores.     It is probably your foundation. Just because the foundation you are using is "minerals" doesn't mean it won't clog pores or cause acne! It's a common misconception. Anything you put on your face will cause acne, simply because it's smothering your pores, and when the pores try to secrete sebum (oil), it can't get out of the pore and becomes trapped. The oils and makeup become backed-up in the pore, and cannot escape, and the longer you leave your makeup on, the worse it gets. If you don't wash your makeup off at night, the oils stay in your pores causing pimples, blackheads and even severe infections. I have found that powder foundations can actually clog pores more, but it also depends on the person. Instead, try a tinted moisturizer, or Maybelline's Pure makeup ($5), it's made of 50% water and no oils:  http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...    At night, wash your makeup off with a LIGHT acne-scrub. Using an abrasive scrub everyday will cause little scratches in your skin that can become infected and turn into pimples. Make sure to gently lather up the scrub, using a little more pressure in the t-zone to clear out oils. Splash water on your face to get rid of the scrub (don't rub off). Pat your face dry with a clean towel. Follow with a light moisturizer to rehydrate the skin. You can also use a mud mask or cucumber mask once a week before you go to sleep to help keep your skin balanced.    What you do in your life also contributes to your skins health. Do you smoke? How's your diet? Do you exercise? Fruits and vegetables are very good for your skin. Try adding more of them to your daily meals. Avoid eating greasy foods or using oily products and then touching your face.    Hope this helps! :)|`|VN2wyTnFaa	I've heard that a couple of people actually break out from using the Bare Minerals brush, so that could be the issue. Honestly, there are a lot of potential reasons why you're breaking out. If you're using St. Ives exfoliating scrub every morning and night, that could be the problem too. You really should only exfoliate every couple of days, definitely not twice a day, it's just too abrasive. Switching to a makeup remover could help a lot or just a regular face wash because it will be a lot more mild on your skin. If you try that and you're still breaking out, then you might just want to switch foundations. Though there are a few less products in mineral makeup, sometimes it still breaks people out. Good luck!|`|wXloRCegaa	Bare Minerals has Bismuth Oxychloride in it that causes cystic acne!!!!  It's a well known skin irritant!  Stop using it and you will stop breaking out!!!|`|duZeLslxaa	Makeup in general can cause you to break out.  It's not the type your using, that's just any make up in general.    Just make sure to wash your face thoroughly and get all the makeup off.  Wash your sheets once a week. I've started doing that and my face stays alot clearer.    && i've just recently started using this new face wash from Neutrogena. It's pink, and it works wonders! My face has never been clearer. I wash it with that stuff at night and in the morning.|`|auxEunrgaa	try wearing concealer instead   and never forget these 3 steps     clense-tone-moisturize|`|sB2ejsYdaa	actually if you put mud on yur face at night and then sleep and then when you wake up you can put darker foundation on then normal like much darker if you want to.btw do not take the mud off. and then youll look GORGEOUS dawlinggg.i do it evryday and i get sooooo many compliments!|`|I4z45fzLaa	foundation actually makes your skin breakout. all foundation does.  ways to reduce the amounts of breakouts are less amounts of foundation and you have to be religeous on taking it off every night.    neutrogena has alot of face washers that you could even put on in the shower. its great.    hope i helped!|`|SjBw4wuEaa	It could be the foundation, i havent tried it, but my friend does and she gets blemishes often. Also it could be because proactiv is suppose to be used 2 or 3 times a day ? i heard thats the only way it works, but then i also heard it doesnt even work period. So proactiv could be the problem. Just stop wearing the foundation for a few days, with your regular skin routine and see what happens. If its still the same, go a few days without the proactiv and use the st ives in the morning, and still continue to wear the foundation. Good luck :)|`|maqCRmehaa	I use bare minerals and it doesn't make me break out.  Try switching and using your proactive in the evening to get your makeup off better and your scrub in the morning.  It could be the St ives that is making you break out since it is a creamy cleanser.  If you think it is one of your products then try eliminating them one at a time and see if the break outs go away.  It could be hormones or something else unrelated to your makeup as well.  It could even be something you use on your hair that makes your skin react when your hair touches your face.  You might try replacing your st ives scrub with a cleanser that has 2% salicylic acid and some scrubbing beads.  That way you get exfoliation and acne control. Neutrogena makes great acne washes.  If you can't get the problem to go away it can't hurt to see a dermatologist!

Bar soaps are very alkaline, and skin is acidic. You want to keep it acidic.|`|h3HjLZ4daa	The body wash is strictly a synthetic detergent product whereas the bars are primarily real soap.  This means that the body wash can have a lower pH (closer to the skin's) than the bar soaps and that is important for some peoples' skin.

5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	Pin-up styles refer to the styles that women wore back in the 40's and 50's. Very retro. :) They leave more to the imagination than modern swimsuits. Bettie Page was a notorious pin up model, for example, and can often be seen wearing these types of suits.Marilyn Monroe, too.

iHna2K7Gaa	If you want something that doesn't clump, Dior is not for you. Their mascara gives great volume, but it tends to clump easily. I would recommend Lancome's new vibrating mascara (Oscillation). It keeps your lashes clump-free, defined, and looking lush and long.|`|jER0X5OPaa	I use Too Faced Lash Injection. I've tried several kinds, and this is the best I've ever experienced. The brush head is larger than normal, so it might take you a day or two to get used to it and get it to look right, but it is so worth it. All the other mascaras I've used (Maybelline, etc). would smear over my eyelids, clump in the bottle after about 2 months or so, and just wouldn't look that good.<br>  <br>  Too Faced Lash Injection never smears on my eyelids. I can rub my eyes and it still won't smear. The mascara lasts all day, and seriously, I must have had my last thing of it for like 8 months (if not a year; I am not exaggerating in the slightest). It is so worth the price (approx. $20). It's goes on smoothly and lightly, but makes my eyelashes thicker and longer.|`|0lewWYJdaa	use an eye lash curler first of all. and heat it before using. a heated eyelash curler holds a curl all day. curl your lashes at the base, the middle, and the tips.<br>  then use COVERGIRL EYELIGHTS IN WATERPROOF. the wax in waterproof mascara holds a curl longer as well. just make sure to buy a good mascara/makeup remover. this mascara works wonders for me, it actually brightens my brown eyes, and it separates, lifts, and lengthens eyelashes! my eyelashes almost touch my eyebrows..and i have shrot, thin, asain eyelashes! xD its about $7 at wal-mart.|`|eIm595O2aa	It's funny, I've always heard that mascara is not something you need to splurge on. Totally true! The best I've found is Maybelline Colossal Volum' Express. I can't use waterproof myself which I hate (because I wear contacts) because it tends to run easily.

W7l1awFPaa	Sometimes people who have BO are unaware of it.  Yes, they can smell their own body, but they have been smelling it their whole lives and to them it is normal and the smell kind of fades into the background.  The only time they might notice is while they are cooling down after heavy exercise.      Telling him about it can be difficult especially if you are not close friends.  You might want to think about asking one of his friends how they would deal with it.  He will probably be offended no matter how you tell him.  Maybe say something like, "You know you would probably attract more girls if you used a different cologne?  That one you use now doesn't suit you."|`|AA11399475	Some people are used to their body odor so they don't notice any changes. If the guy bothers you that much then tell him in a nice way.

Actually it will help define your calves and add shape to your legs...there's definitely more of a benefit than a negative here.  I wear heels like three times a week at work, and I'm fine, no problems whatsoever.  Just make sure you excercise and stretch your muscles regularly, and it will prevent pain.  Have fun!|`|KuJXcGZTaa	You can wear heels more than once a week and not have that happen. You could wear them all days one week, and then no days another week. You won't get/become injured if you do that.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	you can wear them every day. Stupid question.|`|6baa64727b51c64bae38424691f14768aa	Absolutely. Even every other day would be fine.|`|XzdQzO5Waa	I think so. Just keep in shape too and it will make it a lot better.
4gAaNAuwaa	no no no no no. i am 16 years old and had mild  acne before i used proactive. it wasnt anything seriously bad. just stubborn acne on my chin and forehead and the occasional stubborn pimple somewhere else. also once a month it broke out a little more than usual. but i wanted it gone so i decided i would use proactive. i used it for one month. it made my acne worse than it has ever been. i could not believe that something that is supposed to work so good made my skin so bad. i kid you not when i say that there is not one square inch of my skin that is not covered in acne or red marks from acne now. it is absolutely HORRIBLE. when i started proactive i only had acne on my forehead and chin. now it is COVERED MY ENTIRE FACE. it is horrible. i cannot use enough makeup. it literally now takes me 45 minutes to do my face in the morning. and it still looks bad. proactive RUINED my face and the scars from past acne are more noticeable than ever. i dont want to go out in public anymore i am still in shock that my face looks like this. even my mom said that proactive made my skin worse. now im waiting for my dermatologist appt. and i really hope they can help to nurse my skin back to how it was. proactive also drys your skin out so bad i still cant get enough lotion on my face. this was absolutely the worst thing that i have ever used. proactive ruined my life.|`|OX94y7ZIaa	Works for me! ?|`|zYVCJRMXaa	It does work for SOME, not everyone, it failed for me.|`|xWD4XG7Naa	every body is different. meaning every skin is different because of genetic make up. what works for some may not work for others. better off using natural homemade ingredients, keeping hair off face and body, washing face after u wash hair (ingredients in shampoos and condits have elements that clog pores) eat right, drink water. good luck|`|bb2SJvpSaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	truthfully, it sucks...|`|ThE5yYqaaa	really... it only made my skin WAYYY worse... i only know like ONE person it worked for and they didn't have severe acne... the thing was they stopped using it and it ALL CAME BACK LIKE 50X WORSE!!! so she has to keep using it until she can stop using it and it won't come back... which may be a long time considering her skin is now addicted to it... personally i used it TWICE (first time for 1 month... second time for 3 months) same result both times... i followed all the steps etc. and it just made it worse so in my opinion the stuff is ****... i wouldn't use it... sry :(|`|mk7O29Puaa	ProActive didn't work for me, but a product my sis told me about on acne.org worked like magic. Used it for a week, my face clear up and has stayed clear since. Just order the acne lotion, the other stuff is unnecessary.|`|wS5J7egWaa	it worked for friend but not me...ask/call a dermatologist|`|S18ek7j0aa	Not for me. I had a bad reaction, and my face ended up swollen.
lys5kB9Daa	personally i think if you are not part of the wedding party there is no need to pay to get your hair done. just do it normally, not in a messy bun, but straighten it or put a few curls in it yourself, or pull it back with a poof. but i think it would look silly for you to have your hair professionally done if you're not in the actual wedding.|`|oBH8eypOaa	i posted a link with some pictures so you can get a idea. why not a french roll and have curls. simple and beautiful.

Fd4EBV1Vaa	It could possibly be mild Rosacea, while the exact cause of rosacea is unknown, several triggers have been identified that may make the symptoms worse in some people. These include:  exposure to sunlight,  stress,  cold weather,  hot drinks,  alcohol, and  eating certain foods.  Identifying and avoiding the triggers of rosacea can be a useful way of controlling the symptoms.    If you are concerned then go see your GP who may be able to prescribe something (as there are lots of different types of rosacea, they are lots of different treatments.) However, if it is very mild I would suggest just masking it with concealer or foundation.|`|vRyYmCBVaa	Well there's always foundation and blusher.  It probably is the cold causing it.

ueeTcKQIaa	I always liked L'oreal hair color dyes. I think the shades you would probably would like would be Feria espresso 40, the Natural Match dark ash brown (4C) or Natural Match natural black (3N). It's not really a black it's more of a dark brown. If you're still not sure about whether or not it will have reddish/warm tones you should get Ardell Unred Hair color drabber or Ardell Red Gold Corrector Plus (both at Sally Beauty) and add it to the color part only, not the developer and then mix it.     It's probably better to get hair dye from a professional beauty store (i.e. Sally Beauty). You just buy the color and developer seperately.I would suggest a 20 volume developer and they have tons of color dye. They have a website too.    The reason why the hair color faded is probably because you don't have the right products. You should get a shampoo and conditioner for colored hair and get a UV/UVB hair gloss spray (I like Garnier Fructis).     Hope I helped!|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Try a more permanent hair dye (it will say permanent, not how many washes it will last through) then use a color protective shampoo.
OkieSeJHaa	it's really easy!  once you learn how to sew (which is not hard at all)  it's super easy.  you can cut things, sew them, add different buttons or textures of material.  it's really fun and nobody else will have it once you have made it.  you'll be original :)  good luck!|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	You would need patterns which you can buy in fabric / haberdashery shops and you need a sewing machine (you can hire them) or to sew very well and be very patient. lol.
PdSeeHdkaa	do yu keep touching your hair?<br>  change your pillow case ( wash them )|`|SLdZPu4Qaa	well, when you go through/start puberty one of the things is your body starts to produce oils and it makes your hair greasy. for your hair to be in best condition take a shower every day and wash your hair with shampoo.<br>     Put the amount of conditioner as a quarter in your hand. then put your hair as if in a pony tail and put the conditioner in the ends (farthest from scalp) and with the little leftovers put it up by your scalp. that should keep the oils away more and your hair won't look so greasy. but try to take a shower every day. especially at your age.|`|9Gsx32Skaa	the oil glands in your scalp might be overactive, this is from hormones fluctuating in your body. as a woman this will happen about 7 times in your lifetime, and each time it will be something  new. anyway, i would change your shampoo to a clarifying shampoo, and if you use conditioner, only condition the ends of your hair, not your scalp.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	cuz u need to shower more...|`|zih1Weanaa	my hair gets oily the SAME day I wash it by evening. It is just genetics...dont use too much conditioner on your roots, and dont use any product on your roots except for dry shampoo. Dry shampoo will soka up all of the dirt and oil in your hair, so you dont have to wash it everyday.<br>  <br>  I really like T3, they have one for blondes, brunettes, and auburn colored hair.|`|gnIEDg6maa	You just have oily hair which is reallly better than dry hair.  Go to a beauty Supply store like Sally's.  They have pros on duty that can advise you.  You need a shampoo made for your hair type and a non-oily conditioner.  You will also need to wash your hair every day. I had oily hair and I preferred to use Johnsons baby shampoo.  It worked for me.  Just need to wash often.|`|uP9SQhkcaa	When you are 13, everything is greasy and oily. My best bet is that you are touching your hair too much. Try to leave it alone, it looks fine. (: And, if it is still greasy, try washing it more. i mean, you don't really have to, but if your hair is way greasy, you should try.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Alice Danielle|`|w6jgKy2laa	I am 13 as well and my hair is the EXACT same way! It is just becasue of puberty! But it is okay, it happens to everybody! Styilist say you should only wash it 2 times a week because in the future when it stops getting greasy so fast, it will look beautiful! If you wash it to much, you will dry it out and it will look stringy in the future!|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	I'm 14 and my hair gets really greasy too.<br>  Even the next day after i had a shower its already greasy.<br>  I kind of inherited that though from my dad lol.<br>  <br>  It could be because since we're still young and going through puberty or something and all that stuff.|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Stop using conditioner. It's sole purpose is to make hair smooth and it always ends up looking greasy the next day. PS. I don't think it's necessary to wash you're hair everyday despite what these idiots said here.|`|QbOYIixuaa	I do hair for a living. Go to a salon and purchase tea tree shampoo and conditoner. It may cost 20$ or so, but it will take care of you.|`|aM5FTVvXaa	you should really consider showering either every other day or every day. otherwise your hair will continue to get greasy.|`|X48z0Lwwaa	Keep in mind, the natural "grease" your skin produces is probably really good for your hair.|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	Pueberty.<br>  Also, if you wash your hair too often it can get greasy.|`|OtDOAAZwaa	Take A Shower Every Day<br>  gosh thats so gross<br>  i cant stand not washing hair|`|6xfp3bAVaa	That's gross. I'm asian and I have really nice silky hair. WASH YOUR HAIR GIRL. Or you'll give asians a bad rep....|`|CMeWXNoJaa	Ok, first of all, some hair is just greasy. Try rubbing your scalp with shampoo really well. Then rinse really well. Try cutting back on the conditioner because it can make it have dandruff really bad so dont rub your scalp with that, just the hair.|`|CxPO0Fj0aa	<a href="http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip1058.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip1058...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeup/questions-answers/greasy-hair-bqa-062508" rel="nofollow">http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeu...</a>|`|csNQvySRaa	its the dirt and dust that makes your hair greasy, you can cover ur head whenever you go outside and wash ur hair daily with a mild shampoo.and don't worry.its not a big issue.<br>  <br>  Be safe !!!

Also, try mayonnaise once a month...very effective|`|jfwmelYgaa	Shower everyday|`|nOU8WvmDaa	Although I shower daily, I must wash my hair at least every other day (nice to sleep a few minutes later).  Try washing, rinsing, and then repeating.  That second round of shampoo is the secret to to stopping the grease.|`|wxz9mmMWaa	hehehe sux for u i got perfect azn hair :]<br>  <br>  and ya the problem is that u hav to wash hair everyday! ya thats GROSS!|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	wash your hair|`|mQlkWTkTaa	If your hair gets oily easily, thats completely normal..and thats what happens to me. So I wash my hair everyday. Even though its bad (since it washes out alot of the natural oils from your hair) I hate greasy hair! But everytime you do, make sure you scrub really well and use conditioner.<br>  <br>  Also, oil can be caused by stress! Its just a cycle of what we call, puberty...|`|0k9IJYS1aa	i'm asian too<br>  it's probably genetics <br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  try changing product . those product you listing cause buildup and they strip the hair of natural oil. making it more hair oil.<br>  avoid touching ur hair too.<br>  there's alot powder especially for reducing hair greasiness.<br>  my guess is ur hair is black<br>  dont use baby powder .. they sell the kind especially for black hair<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Q5KFND17aa	umm because you hadn't showered in two days....<br>  yuck.|`|db66fc70a6a89edc4973a377afc4fb0baa	There is nothing wrong with yr hair getting greasy like that,It's natural and gonna happen as  you go through puberty. But to keep it from getting greasy you're gonna prbly have to wash yr hair everyday with the products you have now. Or every other day with a certain shampoo and conditioner for greasy hair,try not to use a ton of conditioner,it causes the hair to get dirtier quickly. You don't have to shower everyday if you do not want to, just wash yr hair in a deep sink or under the faucet of yr tub. Keep Clean!lol|`|I5SypMlsaa	that's just the way hair is... however you can consult a nutritionist and they will suggest something in your diet that will decrease that, but it is quiet normal to have greasy hair after 2 days, stop being lazy and wash it! or shave your head|`|BvkjXkcyaa	Shampoo your hair everyday. Shampoos are for oily hair. That's why some people use conditioner, because their hair is dry and shampoo will make it even dryer.|`|kPKKyZluaa	Don't use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Use shampoo for oily hair it's just your sweat and oils that come through more than other people, and races|`|lc9nus8taa	eww you didn't shower in 2 days!! gross <br>  <br>  but you shouldn't wash your hair everyday BUT you must shower everyday lol|`|roIJeulpaa	Welcome to the stages of hormones and puberty!|`|5jsMY4RIaa	My hair does the same thing.

Use the same coloured pencils too to do your inner and outer eye shape!! good Luck!!|`|hahwsMd7aa	chestnut color to bring smokiness to ur eyes|`|idhcqr5Daa	Try blue. Blue is a very common eyeshadow color. Blues are all about being noticed, not natural. But blue doesn't necessarily go great with every ones eye color. blue goes best with brown eyes because they are so opposite that brown eyes will pop. <br>  Consider silver/gray. Silver/gray brings on heavy metals and drama. Silver/gray are usually used as evening shades. It looks great with blue or brown eyes. <br>  Put on brown. Brown or bronze gives off a great natural glow when worn properly. It looks best with dark brown eyes and hazel or light brown eyes depending on the shade of brown. <br>  Be careful with green. Green is a color that was inspired by nature. One of springs best colors, it looks wonderful with Light brown or blue eyes. It can also be very easy to overdo and make you appear like the wicked witch of the East! Be careful and sparing in adding it. <br>  Add some purple. This was the spring of 07's signature color but it looks great in any season when done well. It looks awesome with brown or green eyes. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	Try suttle pinks, beige, and cream, or white.  I also like plums and earthy tones.

5WfC3w2maa	If you love it why not do it again.|`|KKxX5wszaa	The link doesn't work sweetie. I have to be logged onto face-book to have access to your picture, but I don't have a face-book account. Anyways, from context clues, sounds to me that you are Caucasian. Well, I think that you shouldn't go all black. I'm sure that you did look very pretty in black, but since you are so light, you should try a different shade. Trying a more natural and light shade, it will compliment you more well and enhance your natural features. Making you hair dark and contrasting it with a really light colored skin is too intense and is definitely not really fresh. Plus, on the other hand it's spring, go for something more clean, light, and wispy. You should try going a dirty blond, an auburn, a mahogany, or a light brown. I think that it would look wonderful on you. You might be thinking hell no am I ever going to be dying my hair that color, she is crazy, but you may never know unless you try. You might fall in love with it, plus when you grow older you might be like, ew why did I dye my hair black. Anyways, I hope you choose the right color. Good luck. I hope that I helped you.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	No, the blonde looks much better. You will look like Lilly Allen.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You need to learn the difference between "dye" and "tint".

It has no amonia and is much easier on your hair.  It is natural looking and doesn't rinse out.   You get it a Beauty Supply store.  This is what a lot of beauty shops use. It is easy to use.  I think you will like it.
GZKbvXLLaa	I used to wax all mine off, but that was when I was dating someone. Now, I'm not so I just let it grow natural. Yeah, its bushy and all but no one sees it but me so I really don't mind.|`|Jf0s6pByaa	YES i shave it is gross to have someone go down on you with hair in their way same for guys to why would i want to go down on a hairy guy.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	I go hairless. That's just me though. I don't think it symbolizes pre-pubescence... I mean, I've got boobs and a bum (haha, ya edited my previous wording), and while I'm quite thin, I don't at all resemble a 12 year old girl. lol.     I feel a lot cleaner, esp. on the rag. Plus, removal of hair would help a directionally challenged significant other. HA! ;)|`|vwoqIUR6aa	i don't do it all the time. only when i am getting some so right now no.

It gets too bushy.|`|s30Duwdraa	I think it goes both ways.  Personally, i like to shave and leave a racing stripe (vroom, vroom).    It helps with odor and when aunt flow is in town (yuck!).  Not to mention oral sex...Nobody wants a mouth full of pubes while getting down and dirty!|`|ANOvR67Gaa	I like mine shaved.

Try bikini waxing, its great because after you can just keep trimming it.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	nowadays it is something youre taking it for granted.|`|of049X1waa	I shave fully, and to be honest I don't like the way it looks.  It looks immature and even if it didn't remind me of a child, it looks too bare.  But most guys like it, so I shave there.  Probably not the best reason, but some people ar so weird about it--especially in the media, they seem to think is is ridiculous that people have hair down there.  So I don;t know... it is a cultural thing, I guess.  I think it looks best when it is neat enough to not stick out of a bikini, but still there.|`|qaD1jAQYaa	I don't fully shave it, but I keep it a bit neat, so pubic hair isn't visible when I'm in lingerie.|`|6K4YX6ulaa	i think not MOST women....i don't|`|AA12371207	I think totally shaved is a little weird but nobody wants a bush.|`|bDRDJ8Vtaa	No. Most women who want to remove hair from that region opt for waxing. Shaving strengthens the hair and causes stubble, which is not only embarrassing there, but can cause great discomfort from chaffing.     As for the numbers of women who remove hair at all from that region by any manner versus those who do not, I have not come across any figures. Culturally, I think there's a shift toward hair removal (compared to, say the 70's)|`|Rk6lqCuXaa	sometimes i fully shave,sometimes i do cute designs,but i keep it clean,cause if not,it's just nasty.|`|W4gbI6hzaa	I do it when I can be bothered, fully shaved is better :)  x

I would never get fake boobs. The only way I think I ever would is if I had breast cancer and it was necessary.. but even then I wouldn't take it over the top. I'm happy with what I have now.|`|AA11399475	Not every guy loves fake breast, some like them because they're bigger than average. Everyone has DIFFERENT taste.      I wouldn't get fake ones either, I'm VERY blessed in the breast department.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	What is your source for the statement that all men love implants?  I don't think it is true.  I would get implants if I had a mastectomy and therefore needed reconstructive surgery.

Research with a Google "negative results of  botox treatment?" to see. It's ridiculously expensive and in 4 to 6 months you have to have it done again and.....ad infinitum!

They inject the stuff just in front of your hairline, from about the bottom of each temple area to the top. Injections also go back on the scalp in your hair, but not too much. I think they did some between my eyebrows, too. It stings, but only while being injected. Within an hour or two I noticed I couldn't lift my eyebrows (like when doing a surprised expression). That felt silly, but my mother-in-law said I looked ten years younger! I don't have any idea how often you would need treatments; I think I was unable to lift my eyebrows for nearly six months.

PRzmwFfgaa	That's not a link for the internet sweetie.  That's just a link to your pc's picture database.  A link would atleast start with something like http.  <br>  <br>  But from reading your description and not seeing a picture it sounds like you may have gotten a relaxer that either was not rinsed out all the way or that was too strong on your hair.  Either way it will cause a lot of breakage and damage to your hair.  When you take your kinky twists out your hair will probably be severely broken off in some places on your head.  I went through this before.  What do you need to do?  Go to a hairstylist and get a protein treatment and let them cut your hair to even it out -- FYI, this may, depending on the extent and location of the damage mean cutting all of your hair really short.  Then you can decide what you want to do from their.  Rock your hair in a natural style, get it braided and grow it out, get your new growth relaxed and have a short sexy haircut.  Whatever.  But it definitely sounds like the relaxer you got in December damaged your hair.|`|ColDKgGuaa	INVALID LINK, SUCKA.

But that is youth for you -- jump in and then ask how deep it is!<br>  <br>  Black is one of the very worst colours there is.  And if you used a tint, instead of a dye (which you know, of course, is for fabrics, and not hair), it's still a bad thing. There are some very strange and unusual ingredients in it to make it so black, and it is almost impossible to remove.  I think it should be outlawed.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what you mean by "stripping", but I take it, it is something that is different to bleaching.  Yes, the word "bleach" scares a lot of people, so they use other terms, but it's still the same thing.  It is a harsh chemical treatment and they are all damaging to the hair.<br>  <br>  I suppose "stripping" can mean the same as taking something off.  With hair colouring, it doesn't come off, as much as it comes out.  The artificial colour pigments are put INTO the hair shaft so the colour shines from inside, trying to imitate natural hair colouring.  With permanent hair colours, there is bleach in all of them to remove your natural colour, and deposit the artificial.<br>  <br>  If you remove the artificial, you cannot go back to your natural colour since there isn't any natural left.  People forget that.  Your own colour has been irrevocably changed.<br>  <br>  There is a product called a colour remover, which is not a bleach, that dissolves artificial hair pigments only, not affecting natural colour.  Remember that you have no natural hair colour if it has ever been tinted.  The regrowth will be the only thing natural about your hair.  This comes by several brand names, and every colouring company makes it.  Some of them smell horribly!!<br>  <br>  You would not want to bleach your tinted black hair.  They all do what they are supposed to do; they never ever go wrong.  It is the person using them that makes a wrong choice!  Bleach does two things: opens up the hair making it porous so anything can get inside the hair, and it removes colour pigments from hair.  At this point, you do not want to open the hair any further.  You can reach a point where the hair simply shatters, explode, dissolves away with all the chemical treatments.  It's not easy to do, but I have seen it happen a couple of times when people didn't know what they were doing.<br>  <br>  You would want to use a colour remover, which won't open up the hair, since it's already been made porous by the tint already.  All you want to do is remove the artificial colour, leaving your hair in a semi-bleached state.  It may be sort of orange/gold/yellow colour.  Don't worry -- that is normal.  You will have to use a tint closer to your liking, but you need to get that black out of there first.<br>  <br>  This operation, while not really hard to do, needs someone with training, skill and experience to be able to do it easily, and that knows what to do next.  There are a lot of variables along the way, and you could be surprised by something you didn't expect, and not have all the materials and product (or knowledge) to do what is needed at that point.  Yes, there is added cost, but I believe it is cheaper in the long run to have a professional handle this job for you.  While your hair may not fall out, it may break off (not the same thing) if you don't know what you are doing.  A professional will be able to tell which product will be the best thing at this particular time.  You don't want to be experimenting on yourself again, would you?!!|`|aEpPt9koaa	Stripping the color off your hair will strip some of your natural color also therefore it is VERY damaging. If your hair is already showing signs of damage, like major split ends then I would not strip my hair. I'm sure your hair won't fall out but it could begin to break off. I did the same thing, I died my hair black and absolutely HATED it. It was way too dark but I just dealt with it and wore a lot of hats until it grew out. There was no way that I was going to strip it.|`|32AzD1Olaa	Stripping and bleaching is the same thing...<br>  <br>  People make "Bleaching" sound Harsh and bad...but it is really not unless you get it done profesionally.<br>  I am a hairstylist and i use VLIght bleach "beach"prelightener<br>  wich brings conditioner in the powder so it wont be as damaging as the regular kind.<br>  I would recomend you to start off with hilites. Prelightening all your hair can somethimes not come out all even .<br>  Best thing to do is to Go to a professional since you said you have a little bit of hair. they know best.|`|AA12361679	I actually had the same experience back in September of last year...what I ended up doing was cutting it until it was about an inch or so long and bleaching it until I was content with the lighter shade. Plus I used toners and now my hair's a platinum blonde and significantly longer.<br>  They have GREAT toners and deep conditioners at Sally's Beauty Supply. If there's one in your area, go there. Otherwises you can always order the stuff you need online.<br>  Good luck!|`|Eog7lFpGaa	Go to a salon. Ask them to fix it. They'll do something like bleach your hair, but no it won't fall out. Then just have them dye it there also.
UAyRiEGwaa	steam as much of them away as you can,<br>  then while your pores are still opern,<br>  use a nose strip to take away any stragglers.<br>  then, use a pore minimizing masque to close<br>  up your pores.<br>  after this, and if you wash your face daily,<br>  you shouldnt have to go through this procedure too often|`|g0KSiZqbaa	Exfoliate that area and use the alcohol swabs primarily used for cleaning out cuts. Close your eyes though, it's very strong and tends to sting the eyes even if it may seem like you're no where near the eye. <br>  <br>  Try this every other day as to not dry out your skin too much|`|Xe1FJyxJaa	you have to squeez them out. the longer it stays in your skin, the more the pore gets bigger !|`|mbZYLwHIaa	use biore deep pore cleansing strips. they take all the blackheads out!|`|ceRqmrMLaa	Exfoliate. Get something designed for exfoliating and use it with a "face scrub brush" aka a 97cent squeegee from Wal-Mart. Be sure you rinse really well, or the exfoliants will blend with your make up (had that happen before - made my face look like a war zone).|`|mQlkWTkTaa	get a really wet hot towel, hold it down on your black head areas and squezz them out!<br>  Oh and black heads are caused by clogging of the pores so if your not removing your makeup well that could cause more and more...and also you can use an acne scrub from your local grocery store.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	Just Pop The Thats How i Get Rid Of Mine And It Works

But either way it will look good even if it's like a choppy bob, but I love the length that she has.|`|gnIEDg6maa	If she had short hair, it would not make much difference as it would grow out pretty fast but it will take a long time for that pretty hair to grow back.  It looks nice as it is and boys really prefer long hair, but it is hers and I think she should get to wear it any way she wants as long as it is not TOO weird.|`|u8Ts3Nxbaa	PLEASE! dont let her get a choppy haircut!! she has such pretty hair the way it is now. I think choppy haircuts never look good.

SRzL2Wexaa	Wow, I have a hard time believing it's still in your hair after that long.  Your hair must have really been porous (dry) and you must not wash it every day?  I'd think you must have some deficiencies in your diet, since your hair is falling out more than normal.  Maybe you're cutting out protein or something?  I don't think the shampoo would cause that.  I'd say, next time you go to the doctor, mention it to them.|`|gnIEDg6maa	In addition to the Tresemme shampoo and conditioner or damaged hair, use ION leave in conditioner.  Partially dry your hair and spray it on, especially on the lower third of your hair.  You do not need to rinse it out.  Protects and moisturizes.   I use Color Charm semi-permanent hair coloring but it is pretty permanent.  It is natural looking and does not damage your hair.  It has no ammonia and so it does not dry your hair out.  Lots of beauty salons use it.  Buy both at a beauty supply store, like Sally's.|`|abXjEpDvaa	Maybe you should talk to her.<br>  <br>  Deep condition it, use a deep conditioner and sleep with it in.<br>  Your hair wont be frizzy.<br>  <br>  Actually, if you use mayonaise- it makes the frizz go away and it thickens your hair AND it makes the color fade so that you can dye over it easier.<br>  <br>  Thats what I do, it works.
e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	not at all really..<br>  <br>  start out at 18. then 16. work your way to 14. 12. 10. so on.. until you get to about 0.|`|ymXa9xe4aa	wasnt able to view tha vid in my country but i doesnt hurt at all I have 2 done its a pain that you can bear.|`|8IfePMa3aa	If it hurts you're doing it wrong. There is a mild burning sensation along with some discomfort, but it should never hurt.|`|ELkswWpCaa	i did my gauges myself and it wasnt all that bad. If you get a tapered gauge starting at about an 8 and just move it up a few times a week it goes quickly, then get them at a 6 or (slightly bigger) and again move them up slowly. If you're going to go that big, they may take a few months. if you only want small ones they have tapers for that too, and it goes quicly.|`|quHnUWyWaa	you should increase one guage at a time and give the area time to accommodate its self to the new size, this is so as to not to cause the area to rip and break|`|rQmBuXnaaa	no.|`|Lk0noY62aa	I currently have my left pierced twice(2 loop rings) and my right done once.<br>  <br>  I gauged mine like 2 weeks after I first got mine pierced. I don't want to go like you want it, and you can't go THAT MUCH at once. You have to go little by little. It didn't hurt but for like 1/2 of a second. That's it.|`|H7IZFYZxaa	dont be a betch.<br>  <br>  DO IT.<br>  <br>  it hurts if you skip sizes, and i just skipped from 14 to 8.  ahaha<br>  but really, it doesnt matter much when you skip small sizes, if you pay attention to the millimeters you're going up, its only like 2.4 or somethin. and going from like 2 to 0 (not skipping) is 2 mm more.<br>  so there ya go.<br>  seriously, though, the pain is addictive i think.<br>  its not that bad.|`|jinyM8fyaa	I've just got to 00g - 10cm. Its taken me about a year to get it that big after gradually stretching with tapers. It does sting a little bit when going up a size but its not much. If it hurts really bad, take it out and start again, and also don't force it. Nice n easy is the key :)
ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I like the imagery.|`|Box3Jtelaa	Hmm.. I personally wouldn't get that...<br>  My opinion:<br>  Its fugly.|`|KKxX5wszaa	It looks pretty sick. but from a girl's perception, I think you should try something with a little more description and meaning. Do something that has more of something that is different from others. Everyone has a tattooed girl on their arm, come on now, isn't there something else you can do, but if you like it, you should definitely go for it. Don't listen to what I have to say, other people might like it. Haha, good luck! It's pretty fresh tho bruh.|`|quHnUWyWaa	if you are happy with it is that not all that matters? tattoos are for personal reasons and if you are concerned about what someone else thinks then you shouldn't get one|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Not a fan of sleeves.

(Or is it yours?)|`|nXloT3Iiaa	I only like the top half of it but as far as detail its very nice.|`|AA10952559	I personally don't like it, but if you do that's all that matters... Unless it's not your tattoo (which, if that's your girlfriend as your avatar it's not your tattoo unless you're a pedophile), in which case DON'T COPY SOMEONE ELSE'S TATTOO! Design your own.|`|OBNUs2bTaa	tattoos are a bit of a turn off for me
OYtUp0Pnaa	hey<br>  No tattoo is stupid if its something you wont regret in later years! The best person to ask is a tattooest if it will fade or not. for eg: i was gonna get on my hand near my thumb and was told not to because it will require continuous touch-ups and will fade. so just give a tattoo shop a call and ask them, they will be honest with you about your tattoo|`|m7wzE1ndaa	Tattoos won't fade too much, and if it does put some tattoo-safe lotion on it and it should look fresh.<br>  <br>  And there are lots of nerves in the feet soo pain will probably be present.<br>  <br>  And if you want it to be seen then yeah, the placement is dumb, unless you wear flip flops...a lot. But if not and you regret getting it later on, then it is probably best that you got it there.|`|LeJ6Uu3raa	ugh y get a tattoo at all? keep your body the way it was made. think about it, you're really old, u have some picture on you TOE and you think to yourself, jeez what was i thinking?!|`|09cb3765bd85ffd3dfa808c9a40f0431aa	do you want the tattoo?? <br>  if so, its not a stupid idea...|`|Tqof0Frnaa	I talked to a tattoo artist about feet tattoos, and she said that ones under the toe (like the part that makes contact with the floor when you walk) won't last because of walking everyday. Doesn't matter the toe, it won't work.<br>  <br>  Then again she could be crazy but that's what she said. Ha, that's what she said xdxd.|`|6juV48RWaa	i dont think its stupid unless you're getting something really stupid. and it won't fade just because its on your toe. Its a tattoo. meaning you will have it for the rest of your life.|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Do you mean on the underside? Cos most people wont do it. It will fade.<br>  <br>  If you mean on the top, below your big toe, it might be possible, but once again some artists won't do it. <br>  <br>  Just ask around :)|`|8hsEPGgHaa	not stupid at all.<br>  <br>  most people don't see tattoos and think 'wow that's a stupid place'<br>  <br>  I want one on the top of my big toe. a stare :D|`|0FxwJdVIaa	think about when your 80 years old<br>  and yu have wrinkly feet<br>  how good will that look?<br>  :||`|SMKQ47jQaa	stupid idea <br>  dont do it

c720a537294a26363d1792085df262cdaa	when i got my tongue pierced i didn't really feel it at all.  first he put this clamp on my tongue, which made me drool allot, but after a min or 2 i didn't feel anything.  then he told me to close my eyes and take a deep breath....and when i let out that breath he said he was done.  i didn't believe him for a minute, but then he took the clamp off and told me to wash out my mouth.  that was it.  my tongue didn't even swell much.  but it was harder to eat for a little while.  suck on lots of ice right after you get it done.  that helps with the swelling allot.  i got my cartilage pierced and in my opinion that hurt allot worse, i couldn't even sleep on that side for a couple of days.|`|HO1k76qlaa	well, i don't have a tongue ring.. but i've asked my friends and they all said it didnt hurt. only when it swells.. <br>  it's most likely the pain you can take. <br>  i think you can handle it (:|`|BAPj9JW3aa	On a scale of one to 10, mine hurt about a 2....<br>  it wasn't bad at all!..you can just feel the pressure but it doesn't hurt......just go get it!...YOUU CANNN DOO ITTTT :D|`|dyiuwz0qaa	Doesn't hurt a bit! You just get this really weird feeling when the needle goes through your tongue but it doesn't hurt. After a day or so it will get sore, that's why they will give you a straight barbell ring, well its a bar that is just straight, and its pretty long. But after its don't healing and everything you can change it back into a little one that actually fits your tongue! <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|04ZBuoqWaa	Mine didn't hurt much. When they push the needle through your tongue, it hurts no worse than when you bite your tongue. Mine didn't swell all that much, but my sister's swelled up really bad. If you get it done, just make sure that you rinse your mouth out with listerine every time you eat or drink something or it will get infected.
oxL8MEKPaa	IDK, I think it might be a little too much at your age. Try a little thinner line and then smudge it with a q-tip or eyeliner smudger.

Having the entire eye lined kind of "closes in" the eye and makes it look smaller.  Just lining maybe the outer 2/3 of the lower lid might look better and make your eyes look bigger (unless you're wanting them to look smaller for some reason) Leave the liner on the upper lid though, that looks good.|`|45cHcSY4aa	I think you should wear more on the upper lid and less on the lower lid.<br>  <br>  Plus, the lower lid is messed up lol|`|f68vMXQNaa	Are you wearing this during daytime? If yes then hell yeah your wearing too much lol night time is where you can go wild with the eye makeup!|`|zih1Weanaa	It isnt bad.

It might also depend on whether or not you are wearing a lighter or darker outfit as this may cause it to look more or less extreme. Ask a close friend for their honest opinion.|`|03YE18eJaa	yeah thats great  its not to much  mascara and it will be better  but maybe with eye shadow it will be to much for the day unless you just done like a light brown over the lids or a neutral colour|`|pqcNt7DPaa	thats not too much,

You need to put a bit on under the cheekbone, near he jawline & see if the colour "blends" in ur skin. That is if it matches ur skin colour, if not, is the wrong colour.<br>  You can even put 2-3 colours on together to get a feel of the colours.|`|toWa68Goaa	I use the body shop powder foundation, it's very good. <br>  i am quite pale but i have freckles i use number 2 but they also have number 1. <br>  <br>  I also have the liquid one from the body shop it is also very good.

I have a 4g and after a few hours of it being out I am back to a 6g-8g and have to try to argue with it for a while to get it back in. I once went a day without wearing one because I lost it and I had to start at a 10g again. <br>  <br>  is your ear a 20g or an 18g right now (both can be used to pierce)? are you patient enough to go through the sizes and save yourself the pain of jumping sizes or are you impatient and want to stretch fast? how high is your pain tolerance? these are things to consider. I pierced my own ear with a safety pin and then stretched it to a 6g that night, it hurt but I'm impatient. <br>  <br>  honestly, since you're ears aren't stretched I'd started with a 12g taper, 16g and 14g aren't going to be tapers so they're be harder to get in, but a 12g you can get in a taper and a good one will start out very small, with some neosporin or vaseline you'll get in in with liittle trouble and pain.  <br>  <br>  tapers and plugs are pretty easy to find. any store that has body jewelry will have them. spencers, hot topic, tattoo and body piercing stores...<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Oh, please, not those big crater-sized holes in your ears?  Is that what you're talking about?  You know, that isn't like a tatoo that you can have erased in the future.

NI9e9S6eaa	Well I have had my tongue pierced 3 times and if it hurt the first time I would not have gone back and had it done 2 times more.  My healing process for all of mine was about 3-4 days and I was healed but I wouldn't have it done by just anybody you really need to go to a professional who knows what they are doing.  They usually give you a list of specific things to do to help the healing process.  The best stuff to use is Biotene mouthwash cause it is used for minor cuts and sores for the mouth and helps heal faster and keep a cup of ice with you at all times...|`|9mBGgdjBaa	It hurts more to get your lip pierced. I have had mine done, plus my eyebrow and nipples, and my tongue hurt the least. You feel the needle go in, but they clamp you tongue down that you really don't feel they pain of the needle. It takes like 5 seconds. You can handle it.|`|jgXpVlOvaa	the worst part about the actual piercing is the sound of the needle going through the tongue. i got mine done 2 days ago and so far the worst part has been the swelling. just be sure, if you get it done, to rinse with mouthwash after you eat or drink. also try to avoid smoking and drinking out of a straw. good luck to you!|`|ymXa9xe4aa	I also have my labret pierced the tongue hurts lots less than than the labret but yes it is the healing time thats the worst but your saliver is a natural healing agent so the healing time will be cut down.|`|8IfePMa3aa	The piercing itself doesn't hurt, but the healing process is quite the experience.|`|jinyM8fyaa	Yup, the piercing itself will make you jump but isn't so bad. The healing can be a ***** tho. Specially if ya bite it. Ouchies. If you can handle a little discomfort for a few weeks you will be sweet :)|`|w2NA1KuXaa	It didn't really hurt to get it pierced, though it did the day after when it swelled up.  Popsicles were my friend.  But it only lasted a couple days.|`|nXloT3Iiaa	From experience it doesn't hurt when you get it done but the healing process hurts.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	When I got mine pierced, it hurt no worse than when I bit my tongue.
x4izUQ0Laa	Baby powder DOES work.<br>  <br>  I saw this kind of mythbusting show and TV, and it was found to be the next best deodorant after commercial ones. I've tried it myself, and it works well.|`|aJEsKQHNaa	yes i use it all of the time|`|tqn64Pstaa	Baby powder just reduces friction between your skin, It will make your armpits rub smoothly against your arms, but they will not stop you from perspiring and smelling. Plus I don't think guys are that attractive when they smell like babies. I would suggest going to your dermatologist and having them prescribe a good deodorant that actually works and has no fragrance.|`|hqfE3mpoaa	i have heard of people using it but never heard feedback. i know it would be kind of weird but ask your doctor. he/she may have some suggestions that would work for you.|`|htBHCNDtaa	It would probably just turn into a paste with your sweat, lol.<br>  <br>  It's to prevent friction, not perspiration.|`|6TpkjSOuaa	how bout u try it and when u see the results just send me a message.

a1TyUFJ6aa	either put ice or extremely cold water on it before piercing it, or get it done professionally.|`|lcxXW38raa	no matter what there will be some kind of pain i got mine pierced and think of something else right as they pierce it and you dnt feel it go through but u do feel the point it your lip then your face will feel hot but thats all i can do or put ice on both sidesof the lip|`|CgKzxlU6aa	you should get it professionally done!

mk7O29Puaa	My girlfriend told about the toothpaste trick...it brings the swelling down, but don't expect miracles. Use only Colgate white toothpaste, the gels do nothing. My girlfriend showed me how to use coverup(makeup), you can hardly see them after applying. If you don't notice them, you don't touch them, they go away faster!|`|h6AH6Biyaa	Some teen girls recommend toothpaste, to help dry up pimples.  Never tried it myself, but I don't think it could hurt.<br>  <br>  Please resist that urge to squeeze or pop the pimples.  It may very well leave scars.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	Put white vinegar on a washrag and wipe it over your acne once a day.|`|zih1Weanaa	Do NOT pop them!! I do it myself almost every time and then I wish I hadnt because it makes them more red and swolen.<br>  <br>  Keep it super clean, moisturizer, and put peroxide on it with a q tip. And a spot treatment before bed.|`|l0pbK805aa	Evoclin- Its a medicine, works really good but it has to be prescribed so you should see a doctor and ask about it. It's the quickest way for me...|`|g0KSiZqbaa	Use alcohol swabs primarily in every first-aid kit used for cleaning cuts and etc. Then leave it alone, don't use any moisturizer on the area overnight|`|bW3F0YmHaa	Sounds stupid, but put toothpaste on them before you go to bed.. Lol works all the time for me, dries it out or something. I duno, but it works :)|`|DuEBLT2iaa	Usually I pop mine even though thats not good I guess. And then I clean tehm with stridex pads or cleanser and put Crest minty toothpaste on it. It dries them right out.
3vZl65F8aa	Some things that you have to consider is where you live and what types of weather you are in. For example, I live in Colorado where it is super dry even when it is snowing, so when I wash my face more than once my face becomes just covered in dry skin. I wash my face once in the morning and once at night, and that does the trick.<br>         But some things you can do are:<br>  <br>  #1. Decide upon the wash you will use and keep it going. (No switching back and forth between products and/or skipping some days)<br>  <br>  #2. When you wash your face, don't scrub it off! I like to basically give my face a nice soothing massage.<br>  <br>  #3. Apply some type of toner and lotion after the wash. Occasionally (about once a week), try a mask.<br>  <br>  #4. Try not to touch your face! Make it a rule and every time you find yourself touching your face, remove your hands and eventually that will just come second nature.<br>  <br>  #5. One of the most cliche ones, but big ones, is to try to at least eliminate greasy foods and/or add good foods such as berries and fruit. This will help A LOT!<br>  <br>  #6. When it comes to make up, use the good brands that are non comedogenic and such so they do not clog your pours. <br>  <br>  #7. Last, maintain stress levels if possible. Go for that nightly walk, read a book, take a moment out for yourself. Sometimes acne can be triggered by stress.<br>  <br>  <br>      I hope I helped:D|`|pvosPN40aa	buy an anti bacterial body wash like dial and wash your face in the shower. Rinse your face and then wash it again until it is squeaky clean. Drink plenty of water and eat blueberries. Try to avoid rubbing or touching your face|`|mQlkWTkTaa	take daily vitamin C tablets, and NEVER pop your zits, change your pillow case periodically, dont scrub your skin, eat foods with little sodium because that makes your face oily, and dab your skin when it get super oily because black heads are oil that has been built up on your skin and turned...black. Lol. Those are hard to get rid of. Get an blackhead scrub and scrub your nose ONLY! And nose strips, you leave them on for 5 min and strip them off. Works great! And wash your face twice a day<br>  <br>  Breakouts are alot of times caused by stress and hormones!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	You gotta wash your face twice a day.  It's caused by dead skin cells mixing with oils and clogging pores, trapping bacteria and stuff.  Don't wear too much make up, keep your hair off your face, wear comfortably fitting clothing, too.  The friction from tight, uncomfortable clothing will irritate the area, causing it to inflame.  They say there is no connection with eating habits and acne, but still stay away from greasy foods and stuff.  I also heard that drinking too much milk can cause it too, cus it has a special hormone in it.|`|GHZ3fZlsaa	Avoid acidic foods like Porridge - that can cause break outs.<br>  Drink water, cut down on alcohol...don't eat greasy fatty foods.<br>  <br>  You probably don't need vitamins...but you should cleanse and moisturise using creams formulated for congested skin like Pai's Geranium & Thistle moisturiser:<br>  <a href="http://www.paiskincare.com/product_details_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.paiskincare.com/product_detai...</a>|`|ZvGsDrK2aa	Zinc works to help fight it, i know cause i take it|`|HX5H2Twvaa	It's natural for everyone to get break outs and black heads.<br>  But you can try to buy a moisturizing cream and face cleanser for your everyday use. Use it at least two times a day (Morning & Night). It's best to exfoliate your skin at least once a week.|`|XaLNXBEcaa	don't eat outdoor foods like McDonald's or those fast food restaurants NO GREASY FOOD!wash your face twice a day(morning when you wake up and night when you sleep)either use regular soap or acnewash like neutrogena or proactive eat foods like homemade food avoid soda and those drinks eat at least 1 veggie/1 fruit everydaydont touch your face unless your washing it you can put on makeup if you like this is how i turned clear headed!|`|mk7O29Puaa	Buy the acne lotion on acne.org, it worked for me in one week.

One braid on each side (pig tails) and your hair will be nice and curly when you wake up! Don't brush it or it'll get really poofy and frizzy just finger comb it.

Or just try a hair cut.|`|hahwsMd7aa	try putting ur hair in a messy up do
Ulme5ewraa	I doubt that this is anything serious.  I had my cartilage pierced a few years back, although I had mine done by someone I worked with, who poked a hole in my ear with an earring...  Anyways, I don't remember the exact time frame but I am pretty sure that when you put that first earring in at the piercing you are supposed to wait AT LEAST a month before removing them for other earrings.  The ear takes a long time to heal, especially on the inside of the hole where it gets little air and the earring is constantly rubbing on it.  If you take the earrings out too early you are essentially tearing the partially healed hole and starting over again from square one with the healing process.  If things get worse, I would see a doctor.  But if I were you I would put the earrings in and leave them in for a month and let the ear heal.  Also be sure to wash it a couple times a day with ear care antiseptic so it doesn't get infected.  That's a whole different ballgame and trust me it isn't fun.  Good Luck|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Quit getting pierced, get good grades to go to college, and you will meet great people of the opposite sex and make a lot of money when you get your degree.|`|UtrqncQwaa	um ur not supposed to touch your piercings until they are completely healed and that's like a month or 2 i think its 1 and a half for cartilage|`|BAKLvAGmaa	yes. you should try putting rubbing alcohol so it won't get infected. and ice it. if it doesn't get better go to your doctor.|`|ZZIvjr3Eaa	Sweet|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Leave the ear rings out! Let them heal up.<br>  <br>  WAIT at least 6 months before even thinking about getting repierced.<br>  <br>  When you are ready, go find a reputable tattoo/piercing shop that will do them.<br>  <br>  Gun piercings are NOT good at all for your ears. All it is is forcing a blunt object through your skin/cart. Getting pierced with an actual piercing needle (which is hollow) allows the needle to remove part of the flesh and promote easier, faster and better healing.<br>  ------------Edit--------<br>  Alcohol/peroxide or the cleaning solution given by department stores is NOT good for piercings at all.|`|SBr3IxPhaa	Um yeah, you should NOT have taken out your earrings, what were you thinking? Didn't your piercer tell you not to touch it for atleast 4 months??? Put it back in, leave it alone, and clean it twice a day with saline solution. DON'T use rubbing alcohol, it'll just dry it out and infect it more.<br>  <br>  No touching!!!!!|`|89mJnDMAaa	I think you shouldnt be worried  mayb it got infected when you get a piercing you always have to be cleaning it.<br>  i had my cartilage pierced and its great you have to wait a while tho.<br>  Everything will be fine =]|`|ThE5yYqaaa	ok the other answers were just stupid... (mark r and carl d)<br>  <br>  what you said about the first part is normal although you should not have taken your piercing out to begin with until it's fully healed!!! i don't know why you did that!!! but ya i'm not sure if the blood gushing is normal or not but perhaps go back to your piercer and ask them because they will be able to check it to make sure it's healing properly and give you something to use if it's not... the only thing i can think of is i think you may have damage the inside of the piercing when you took out the jewelery... idk if you should be concerned or not but i'd def. get it checked out anyways.... in the meantime i'd use a sea salt soak for your ear to prevent infection! as someone else said DO NOT TURN THE EARRING!! because that could damage the inside... if you need to get the fluid (sea salt and water solution) inside the piercing GENTLY move the earring back and forth SLOWLY until you feel it slide easily... this worked very good for my lobe piercing... i know cartilage is different but sea salt works wonders!!! and prevents infections very well!!! oh and listen to the ppl who say not to use alcohol/hydrogen peroxide/store bought cleansers... you can also wash it with anti-bacterial or anti-microbial soap once a day... but i'd reccommend the sea salt soak because that worked better for me :) hope that helped!<br>  <br>  good luck! hope all goes well!<br>  <br>  EDIT: i just saw that someone said the healing time for cartilage was 1 or 2 months.. no actually it's 3-12 months! they take a LOT longer to heal because there aren't many blood vessels in your cartilage that carry oxygen and promote healing to the site... just thought i'd add that... cuz you shouldn't even think about taking your jewelery out until at least 3 months later...

Wy0lUjP9aa	I have heard of this. I have heard it works way better than cocoa butter. I was going to try it since I have stretch marks from growing to fast. Usually when people would use it they use it 3 times a day I heard was the maximum.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	You can ask your obstetrician or a dermatologist, but my baby book says stretch marks are really beyond the control of either patient or doctor.  They do lose their red color after a few months, though, and become the same color as the rest of your skin.<br>  <br>  My baby book dates back quite a few years.  Perhaps some new treatments have been developed since then -- let's hope so!|`|u1FlCXL0aa	vitamin e oil is really good for skin<br>  so i guess it would help<br>  i like the good old fashion coco butter thou|`|tqMi1Iefaa	Take the vitamin E oil, and rub Bio-Oil on the stretch marks - really - it is great.
hhYHGHNsaa	of course guys can use mousse and other hair products! youd be surprised how many guys use products on their hair! lol!<br>  you actually want to use mousse on damp hair, not dry hair. you could use it on dry hair, but make sure you use a very tiny amount becuase it might get sticky or leave a residue on your hair. <br>  i would recommend using it on damp hair. <br>  hope i helped! :)|`|OmzJq7EIaa	Yeah lots of men use mousse.  You can use it on either damp or dry hair, depending on what exactly you want your hair to do.|`|eEwG0EeJaa	Yeah, they use it on wet (damp), and dry hair.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	Yes, they do.

oxL8MEKPaa	Just put a little on the top lid only. Then smudge it with a q-tip or eyeliner smudger. Put on a little mascara on and some lip gloss and your'e all set to go. Grey or charcoal looks hot with brown eyes.|`|35PQUYqraa	i use liquid eye liner on the top lid<br>  then normal eye liner on the bottom lid along the water line<br>  and liquid liner underneath the bottom lashes and use a q-tip to make the line thiner|`|VFQyC7Vlaa	Since you're 14 I would suggest using a dark brown eyeliner. Apply it directly on the lashes so it just shows through and defines them don't apply it all around your eye.|`|idhcqr5Daa	Choose an eyeliner appropriate for your eye color . Browns, gilded bronzes, and plums are great for lighter eyes and dark eyes can pull off a more drastic black backdrop. Silvers and charcoals look best on green and blue eyes; rich red browns for blue eyes and golds for green eyes. *Note: Red tints make eyes look redder and blues make them whiter. Make sure your liner complements the color of your shadow. <br>  So many to choose fromConsider the type of look you're after . Pencil eyeliner gives your eyes soft definition, while liquid versions offer precision and drama. You can also moisten dark eye shadow and apply it with a small, flat brush to double as liner. <br>  Prepare to apply the eyeliner .<br>  If you are using a pencil, sharpen it (see Warnings). Warm and soften the very tip of the pencil by heating it with a hot zap from a hair dryer. This will help it write smoother. <br>  A liquid liner should be checked for clumps or excess. <br>  *Prepare your smudging pencil and/or brushes. <br>  Prepare a cake liner or a dark eye shadow by applying a small amount of water (usually one or two drops) to your brush. Move the wet brush gently through your cake liner or dark shadow. Hold the brush or pencil as you would hold a pen. <br>   Rest the elbow of your dominant arm on a hard surface , and rest your wrist on your face. <br>   Tilt your head backTilt your head back slightly and bring your eyes to a half-open state. This creates a good angle for application, while allowing you to see what you're doing. <br>  Use your left index finger (if you are right handed) or your right index finger (if you are left handed) and pull your eyelid gently to the side and slightly up, towards the far end of your eyebrow. This step is optional, because some people find it easier to draw accurately on a relaxed eye; also, stretching the eye may encourage wrinkling. To prevent the eyelid from shaking if you do not pull it, focus gently but intently on your eyes in the mirror. If you are applying eyeliner to someone else's eyes, ask them to choose one spot on the wall to look at. <br>  Draw a line across the upper lid on the lash line (as close to your lashes as possible while still on the lid). This creates the desired illusion of having thicker lashes. <br>  If you're using liquid liner, allow it to dry before opening your eyes all the way, or the color may transfer into the crease of your eye. <br>  Soften the look by gently smudging the line with your brush, a cotton swab or your finger. If you desire a crisp, straight line, as is the case with liquid eyeliner, do not alter unless it's messy. Any cleaning touch ups should be done with a cotton swab dipped in eye makeup remover. <br>  Remember that there are many variations on eyeliner looks . If this is your first time, you might want to start with a smudged eyeliner look  <br>  Smudge the line <br>  A flick at the end <br>  Line the lower lids . Some people put the liner just below the lower lashes, while others prefer to put it on the rim of the eye, above the lashes (see Warnings), or even on the upper innerlash rim (if you're super skilled, careful, and daring!). Moving from the outside edge inward, draw a line lightly, but don't go for perfection, you can go back over the faint line and darken after the stroke. Your line should be slightly thicker at the outside corner, becoming thinner as it moves in toward your nose. Follow the shape of your eye! It looks more natural. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|45cHcSY4aa	on the top lid, apply it from the corner of your eye to the outer part of your eye.<br>  <br>  on the bottom lid, do the opposite. apply it from the outer part of your eye to the inner corner (:|`|tFIS2HbVaa	I have dark brown eyes and i love wearing black eyeliner. it looks so awesome. if you don;t like the way you look with eyeliner on the waterline, don;t put eyeliner on it. just put some on top.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	it difficult to describe it <br>  you shud see it soo heres a video<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CscN3pYzPfk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CscN3pYzP...</a>|`|HO1k76qlaa	try putting it on your water line, if it makes you look mad on your bottom lashes!<br>  but don't put too much.. <br>  and use liquid eyeliner for your top lids.

gnIEDg6maa	That looks great but finding someone who knows how to cut and style it may be a problem.  Take a photo with you to a pro. and ask their advice.  Good luck.  I love it, too.  Don't forget, some of these professional actors have someone standing by to work on their hair constantly.  They also pay a great deal of money for their hair cuts.  $300.00 or more I have heard and it needs to be cut very frequently to keep that look.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	I think that hair style will need a little time in the morning to style.<br>  Just ask your hair stylist (if you're getting it cut) how to do it; they should tell you easy.<br>  <br>  (: I hope I helped!|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Yes, it will definitely work.

Big mistake. It will make you very orange or yellow. Boxes normally don't give you the right mixture of product.      Get the real stuff at Sally's beauty supply - I use B&W or there's a blue packet that is called Quick Blue. Mix with a 40 developer, ask the cashier just to be safe, but I think it's 40 I use. And leave on as long as it takes to get the desired lift you want, it will be orange or yellow if you take it off too soon. Also, ask them to give you something for orange or yellow tones. I put in this purple stuff and it takes the red tones out, and they also have them for yellow or orange tones. It makes the coloring look red or purple but your hair won't turn that color - I promise!|`|IpHIeaMEaa	You most definitely need a professional to lighten that extreme a difference. Besides risking an unwanted color, you are probably going to seriously damage your hair. Then all you can do is cut it off.     If your hair is previously dyed dark, it will leave a stain. Also there are dye removers and other products that a pro would know what to use and how. It is always better to go lighter than darker because of what darkening does to the hair.

Not many people can keep that kind of diet up 24 / 7 though, but if you incorporate those foods into your diet and stuff your face with them when you do feel like eating right it will do you good lol. They wont change your skin colour at all, but they will give you healthy skin and it should appear healthy, which i think is nicer than using foundation to disguise pale skin. You must embrace your natural skin tone.     You could take Omega3 vitamins to make you sure you get a good dose of fish oils, they sell them in boots and health food shops.    Alternatively to make your skin appear a bit brighter, you could use a bit of cheek stain to give you that cute flushed cheeks look and pep your complexion up a bit.

I just know whenever I do not take my make-up off at night, I break out the next day!|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Well people aren't really putting their makeup on just before they go to bed. If they're falling asleep in their makeup they've had it on all day so it's basically having makeup on for around 24 hours and that's where the problem is. Your skin has no opportunity to breathe and any oil that your skin naturally produces is going to be backed up in your pores causing break outs.

I've had friends make the mistake of using table salt.. but if you're using what they've given you, you're fine.    You can use antibacterial soap on your piercing. It's good to use a foaming antibacterial soap, my piercer always recommended Provon (it's a medicated soap), but I could never find it. If it's unscented, you should be fine.    Also make sure you're not overcleaning, but it sounds like you're not. Twice a day is perfect.     It's probably not infected. It's a brand new hole in your body. I doubt there's anything to worry about just yet.     Oh and don't dry it, just dab off the access water. The warm water stimulates cell regrowth and speeds up the healing process. Also, when you're in the shower let the water hit your piercing for like five minutes.    If you feel like it is getting infected, go to your doctor - DON'T take it out, it can trap the infection if there is one - and get a round of antibiotics and it should clear right up and you can decide if you want to keep it or not once the infection is gone. But all piercings get tender the first few days, I doubt it's nothing to worry about. Your cleaning regimen sounds good so far.    Hope this helps :)|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Don't use soap, it dries out piercings and will make things worse.    A bit of redness and tenderness is to be expected in the first few weeks, it's totally normal.    Your cleaning isn't the best either. Since it is hard to soak a nostril in a cup of water, try dipping a piece of sterile gauze in the solution and holding it gently over your piercing. q-tips can be used to remove build up but you need to soak the piercing first.     What is your concentration of sea salt to water? it should be no more than 1/4 tsp sea salt to 8 oz water. if you make it too strong it can dry out the piercing.

Try to pour the water over the piercing. They are sore for a few days. Mine did act like it was infected a few times, just keep cleaning it. I would clean it more than two times a day though. Make a circle with your forefinger and thumb and put it over your piercing, you shouldn't put ANYTHING around the piercing inside the circle.|`|EaIOXWStaa	DON'T USE HAND SOAP  Idk why, it might irritate it.  Mine went red and hurt a bit, when I knocked it it fxcking killed me.  It's normal.    How I cleaned mine is, got a cotton bud (the ones you clean ears with) dip it in hot salt water, clean the entrance and exit of the piercing and clean with a fresh bud.  And mine's fine 7 months later :]
UYnZtJ2daa	You need to be at 2mm for about a month before you go to the next size...you're rushing into things and need to take it easy. You're bleeding because you tore your ear. Stretching isn't a fast process and you need to let the piercings heal in between stretching.    Get that plastic crap out of your ear. It's probably acrylic and it's awful for piercings that are healing. I don't care if you say your body is a fast healer...you need longer than a week and definitely longer than a night. If you want your piercings to stretch healthily then you'll wait it out. Tapers are awful to wear, acrylic is horrible, and you need to slow down.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	DOWNSIZE!    If your ear bleeds, you're going WAY too fast.     Never wear tapers as jewelry!    Stretch one size at a time, then wait 6 weeks for smaller sizes (12 weeks once you pass 4 gauge or so) before stretching again.     Safe Stretching Guide:  http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	I've stretched my ear 2mm from start. Mine never bled because l stretched it slowly and put some lubricant on it to help it slide. Your ears shouldn't be bleeding when your stretching it. You need to downsize to 1.6mm until it heals, and then go to 2mm SLOWLY.    EDIT; Discharge is fine, as long as it isn't discoloured. BUT, what material is your stretch jewellery? Is it Acrylic or steel, etc?    EDIT2; okay, um, you need proper tapers, you've seem to have stretched your earlobes to quick, you need to either let your lobes heal, and then stretch again SLOWLY, or downsize to 1.6mm again. Moving the taper won't help. What material taper are you using??    EDIT3; Okay, but go further when you've HEALED. okay?    Good luck x|`|JWIPJs09aa	you have got to slow down and let your poor ears heal in between stretches. If you don't, you will blow out your earlobes and be left with some seriously nasty scars :(|`|ypZvH5uHaa	THAT THESE UGLY DUSTING THINGS OUT NOW! The Spacers are so ugly!! EWWWWWW!

of049X1waa	The pants fit but they are probably low waisted.  Try pants with a higher waist (not super high, lol, but not low slung) or try tighter pants that won't slide down as easily.  Or even a belt|`|eKGU2ujYaa	try a belt|`|VXW1XeFsaa	If you don't like high-waisted pants (which is understandable), try getting extra long shirts or extra long cami's to layer under your shirts so they will cover you when you bend over.  (Available at Modbe onine, or shade clothing).  There are also body suits that snap under your crotch.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	This is the first time I have seen a woman ask this question being really concerned that her panties show when she bends. I am not a woman but I think you should try some of the advice from other women you are getting  here.    A lot of times, I have asked by women don't bother about their panties showing. In the last couple of years, almost every woman I know had her panties showing like this when she bent down, and I have wondered if they cared.

onKfEYL0aa	It depends a lot on your genetic makeup and the fact your body is still going through many changes. The older you get, the longer and thicker it will be. In the coming months and years you will see constant improvement to your facial hair. It will look better all the time.  Shaving the hair, despite what the people on Answers are telling you, will not make it grow any faster or thicker. It takes time!  Go to beards.org. This site is awesome. It is loaded with info on facial hair.  Good luck man!|`|OHqRZ9Tzaa	your not a woman are you? lol|`|NdrO7u79aa	Unfortunately there isn't really anything you can do about it.

My stylist uses this on my hair and it works just as good, if not better than the expensive brands--you can find it in local beauty supply shops or online (recommended).

adyNCp6eaa	My hair was exactly like that and this is what I did: I got it cut to about my shoulders, layered, and angled at the front so it frames my face. (If you dont like it that short then you can do like a couple inches below the shoulders and it will still look good but it will be medium length instead of short.) Then i got  bangs that were about down to my eyes, and made them side bangs. To make sure they don't split down the middle, after you take a shower, take most of the bangs and use a fine-toothed comb to brush them to the side and let them dry like that. The small portion left of your bangs you brush to the other side. Do this and your bangs should stay.

ec800966099e02a9090fd20472ae5565aa	honestly, I don't think anyone can tell you if it hurts more for a skinny person (although I've heard it too). think about it, everyone has a different tolerance for pain, so unless someone has had it done twice (once while skinny and once while fat) there is no way of judging it....<br>  <br>  the worst part was the clamp. I didn't feel the actual piercing happen because the clamp hurt and I looked away. so, if you look away (and hold someone's hand haha!) you probably won't even notice when they do it. I'd say it was about a 6-7... <br>  <br>  if you really want to get it done, just do it. it's only a little bit of pain for a very short period of time, then some tenderness for the next weekish, and tenderness when it gets caught on something for about a month. I'm happy I got mine done :)|`|QL56syElaa	Umm I'd say its a 7!..It hurts but the pain went away immediately..Just don't mess with it! And I think the thinner the skin the less pain..I have thicker skin and yes it did hurt...but you'll live!|`|hCI0KnOraa	How painful a piercing is largely depends on the person that is being pierced...it also depends on the piercing technique and experience of your piercer. <br>  <br>  Since you already stated that you have a pretty low tolerance of pain, I'm fairly certain that it will be mildly painful...but the most pain you should feel should only be enough to make you squint and/or grunt. It is also normal for some people to tear up as the needle is sliding through. It should not be unbearable. Having a little "meat on your bones" doesn't really matter as far as pain levels go. As long as your skin is stretchy and there is enough room to work with (this is determined by the individual piercers), you're good to go!<br>  <br>  All in all, if you're serious about wanting a belly button piercing and you are going to take proper care of it, then go for it! It's well worth the brief moment of pain.<br>  <br>  After getting pierced, it's important to take care of it so that you do not become infected or reject the piercing (causing it to rise to the surface and if allowed to continue will eventually fall out). <br>  <br>  -Remember to wear clothing that is loose fitting that does not rub excessively on the piercing site. <br>  <br>  The two best cleaning solutions (in my opinion) are sea salt soaks/solutions and antibacterial soap and water. Sea salt solutions can be purchased premixed...or you can buy sea salt (non-iodized) and mix it with water. Antibacterial soap should be dye and fragrance-free so that they do not cause irritation. <br>  <br>  -If using a sea salt solution, cleanse the piercing 2 times per day. <br>  -If using an antibacterial soap, dip a q-tip or cotton ball in water and then add the soap. Cleanse the area 2 times a day (remember to rinse afterwards). <br>  -Make sure that after you clean, the piercing is free of all crusties (warm water should take these off quickly) so that when the jewelry moves, it won't irritate the inside of the piercing. <br>  <br>  **Remember that there is such a thing as TOO clean. Stick to cleansing the area 2 times a day, unless you touch it with dirty hands or dirt/dust comes in contact with it.<br>  <br>  **Also, some piercers recommend rotating your jewelry at least once a day, this is not good to do. Piercings tend to heal from the outside in (many piercings appear completely healed when they are not) and rotating the jewelry can disrupt the healing process. <br>  <br>  Good luck and Happy Piercings!|`|3ZoxO24naa	It doesn't hurt at all.

So you shouldn't really depend on our opinions, go get a haircut that is suitable for you. It doesn't even need to be chic, trendy, or stylish sweetie. You will make it as if it is in style, if you get a cut that suits you! I hope that I helped!

QYIEleTKaa	Nah! Just tell her if she asks that some1 got them for you as a present|`|zMDCMTrIaa	I don't think you need to ask permission or feel like you are copying her.  I must admit that I rarely see someone with the same shoes on that I am wearing, but I'm sure there are many that own the same.  The only way I would consider myself copying, is if the shoes were custom made for some special occasion that you both were going to attend.  I think you should purchase these shoes, and if you ever see this girl and she notices you having the same shoes, tell her that you saw them on her and just had to have them.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Go buy them then tell her to f off! You like the shoes & that's all there is to it. You shouldn't have to not buy something just cuz the girl next to you has it.

Buy lots of shoes.|`|x7wYpLPvaa	nooooooooooo dont ask permission just buy them now a days a lot of pple have the same shoes think about how many pple have nikes, jordans,converse,wedges etc just b/c you want one your not going to ask permission to everyone who has a pair just get them im sure shes not the only one in the world that has those shoes plus she didnt make them|`|rvtktabkaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Well since you don't exactly know her then I think you should just go ahead and buy a pair.

Otherwise you can get them and just not wear them at school or wherever that girl is. You could ask her about them like, "Oh my gosh I love your shoes. I've been thinking about getting a pair just like them." and see how she reacts. You shouldn't need her permission, but just be careful.|`|3A73oIoraa	If she was your friend you should ask her first. If you hardly know her, I wouldn't worry about it. You don't have to ask her.I think it is unreasonable to get mad  at someone you hardly know buying the same shoes as you.

AA10091300	it doesn't work well and dries out your hair. Give your hair a break and take it to your hairdressers or local beauty school.|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	if you can't bleach it then go to a salon and have someone do it, don't risk the chance of turning your hair funny colors or damaging it badly. I don't think lemon juice will work, I've never done it so I wouldn't tell anyone to try it out. Just go to a salon.|`|Q5KFND17aa	no it will turn a dark orange if it even lightens at all...i used BLEACH on my black hair to get it to blonde and it took multiple times with even that to get it a MEDIUM blonde.|`|gnIEDg6maa	No, don't do it.  For such a drastic change you need to go to a professional, at least for the first time.   I think lemon juice is very drying.  It is an acid and eats the finish off of your hair.  P.S. don't suck on lemons!  The acid will eat the enamel off of your teeth.  Ask your dentist, if you don't believe me.|`|XqQH50BDaa	it will look like crap lol and be orange|`|zg2lD633aa	jaja i wouldnt do it homie!!!<br>  lol|`|KKxX5wszaa	I don't suggest you on doing that, you should try bleaching it, or else just leave it. I'm pretty sure you hair doesn't look bad. I'm sure that your hair looks fine the way it is, why do you want to bleach you hair anyways, it will just permanently damage you hair. Anyways, you shouldn't use that lemon juice method, you so wouldn't want to take the chance of damaging your hair sweetie. I hope that you choose the right decision! Good luck!|`|1ONdy9h7aa	Don't use that! It'll damage your hair.<br>  I use a hair-lightening product called 'sun in'<br>  you just spray it in your hair, comb it so it is evenly applied, then go in the sun. Your hair lightens after about two days in the sun.<br>  <br>  It worked for my black, Japanese hair, so it'll work for anyone. ^^<br>  and it has conditioner in it, so it's not as damaging as lemon juice.<br>  hope this helped, and good luck!|`|2QgGUhAAaa	Yes Lemon Juice works like that old product 'Sun In' back in the day. But you must use the sun to lighten it, or a blowdryer on high heat. It'll only make light streaks. It takes time though. If your hair was dyed black forget about it, you cannot bleach it, you're asking for trouble. Oh btw, you can use a regular bottle of peroxide and use a blowdryer on high heat, that lightens your hair. We use to do that back n tha day.|`|abXjEpDvaa	Yeah my friend did it, but her hair wasnt black.<br>  It will make your hair a lot lighter, but you have to sit in the sun with the lemon juice in your hair for like an hour+. Probably longer for you cuz your hairs black..|`|UNqx7OrZaa	no O_______________o<br>  thats absoloutely ridiculous<br>  crazy girl<br>  that will ruin your hair<br>  lemon juice is nothing like bleach..|`|g0KSiZqbaa	It may not have the results intended since you have such dark hair. You could try a lightly concentrated version with peroxide and water.. or just dunk your head in a pool for a month

oxL8MEKPaa	Yes bad!  Try Witch Hazel astringent instead. $2 at the drug store.<br>  Alcohol drys up your face, but it also causes your oil glands to over react and over secrete oil. Don't use alcohol.<br>  <br>  Clean and clear is an excellent face wash for teens. or anyone.|`|v0FlUan0aa	i wouldnt use alcohol. it might burn if you have a cut or something. i would buy some cleansing wipes. netrogena has some good ones!|`|CuhJRewLaa	no, its actually th main ingredient in alot of acne cleansers<br>  <br>  itll just dry up your face so use some lotion after|`|II5N7XYKaa	It's probably way too drying, and will cause your skin to peel and be irritated.|`|H6rPxpHWaa	Instead of alcohol use mild soap.|`|4jSb7ri9aa	I think so. Try not to do that.|`|MXkXsCoGaa	Alcohol is very drying. It may seem to remove dirt makeup and oil but the skin is an organ; part of its function is to produce oil. If you strip the oil off (or dry it up with alcohol) the skin will produce even more oil to make up for what was taken away. Therefore, giving you worse skin than you already had. If you do use alcohol, neutralize it with water and apply moisturizer (or a natural oil like almond, or olive)  to the skin to prevent excess oil production.|`|NzezdETKaa	seems a little harsh for your face.

The scar is actually kind of cute, it looks like a little freckle but since you already have a scar like it I don't think that it will look that different once you take it out.

qV8bM94Taa	Well.... the CHI straightener is a really good straightener, or there is the GHD which is FANTASTIC haha but its really expensive. Conair also sells straighteners that keep your hair straight and nonfrizzy the entire day; those are probably the least expensive out of all of those options. I would recommened the Conair for an inexpensive straightener and one that keeps your hair straight all day, especially if you have thick hair. But CHI, if you have thinner hair.|`|8hsEPGgHaa	Best one ever.

75ae4dd030c983bd678c722ce696f017aa	Neutrogena has worked better for me. It's more gentle. When I used Proactive my face dried out really bad. I've had better experience using Neutrogena products. Have you looked into skinID by Neutrogena? It looks really good and the reviews are great.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	Neutrogena: it does the same thing as proactive for less money; you don't really need proactive unless you have REALLY HORRIBLE acne.|`|roGXVGFOaa	neutrogena|`|intuNZllaa	Neutrogena - removes your makeup, cleans, better if your skin doesn't have a lot of acne and doesn't react badly to lots of stuff.<br>  <br>  ProActiv - This doesn't remove your makeup, basically all it does is help you fight acne. You should always remove your makeup or wash your face with a GENTLE cleanser with no active ingredients in it before you use it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Neutrogena<br>  <br>   Pros: Good for sensitive skin, removes your makeup, cleans.<br>   <br>   Cons: Not good for acne, might make you break out if you have acne, cheap, doesn't help with acne.<br>  <br>  <br>  ProActiv: <br>  <br>   Pros: Helps your acne, makes your skin smoother and less red (Generally what its for, of course. Works best for that, because it's got active ingredient BENZOYL PEROXIDE 2.5%)<br>  <br>   Cons: Can be harsh on skin, makes skin dry and flakey, does not remove makeup, <br>  <br>  <br>  My recommendation: ProActiv, but make sure you have a gentle cleanser with no active ingredients first. :)|`|q8Ogmfw1aa	hey why you don't you try something new<br>  what about <br>  <br>  "Artistry"<br>  <br>  visit this site for all your skin care needs<br>  <br>  www.smatadin.Qbeautyzone.com|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	I like Neutrogena's Stress Control Power Cream Wash<br>  <br>  It's soothing and gentle, but it is still a salycic acid treatment wash so it's good for treating AND preventing acne and breakouts|`|jER0X5OPaa	Everyone's skin is different, so what works for some people might not work for others. Many people have had great success with Pro-Active, and a lot of people haven't. I used to use Pro-Active, but now I use a Neutragena (spelling?) face wash, and then a topical acne treatment. I like the Neutragena because it smells good (grapefruit : ) and is gentle on my skin, but does the job. It's got little micro beads in it to gently exfoliate my skin. <br>  <br>  I once read in a magazine that it's good to leave your face wash on for about 30 seconds, to help it fully do it's job. I started doing that recently, and it seems like it's better, but I don't know yet. It definitely hasn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Also, acne is a bacteria, so it can get used to your face wash so that it doesn't work anymore, so I after I finish a bottle, I switch to a different kind so my skin can't get used to it. This definitely helps, and I know a lot of people who do this.|`|xrXDv9q5aa	Neutrogena cleans but doesn't really solve an acne problem , <br>  <br>  proactive is good , it really works. <br>  but sometimes drys out your skin && after you stop using it , all the acne coems backk . <br>  =/

You should definitely go and ask an artist, you may even wanna try more than one shop. <br>  <br>  I suggest printing the names out in the order you want and in a few fonts that you like, and the size you think would be good, and take it in and see what they can make of it, they will know if it will be easy to read or if it will blend together.

(I reference the sephora's website so that you have more choices, but they don't have bobbi brown listed there, but it looks just like the smashbox one or the stila Smudge Pots) it lasts long and waterproof, you have to take it off using proper eye makeup remover (lancome has a very nice eye makeup remover)<br>  here are some pros and cons:<br>  pros: last long, waterproof, not easy to get off...<br>  cons: some what inconvenience to put it on unless you already get used to it. and you have to apply eye makeup remover to remove it, which makes eye makeup remover another concerns for you.<br>  <br>  hopes it help.|`|6fsBkK7saa	I have this thingy that's not a classic type of eyeliner, but it rocks. It's a set of eye shaddows with a clear (colourless) liqid liner, which turns any eye shaddow into a liquid eyeliner. :] It's cool, especially if you like unusual colours (this way, there's no limit to the colours you can use), and if you like doing crazy eye makeup, it's precious. It's from Too Faced (or something like that), you can get it in Sephora. But if you want just plain black, find something else. I think Max factor has good stuff.|`|aWqCdvqkaa	Eyes are sensitive organ so always go for quality products especially for eyes.Use Lakme,Oriflame or Loreal eyeliners as they work best for me.Even elle eyeliner is good and cheap.<br>  Pencil would cause creases so i would recommend you liquid one.Do some practise and you'll be all perfect.<br>  Hope it works for you,all the best...take care!|`|iTjZMSukaa	I like pencil.

Buut you can answer that in all of 10min by calling them.

That would be like saying... Gee you know I'm in too great of shape..my muscles are too tight and firm... should I take up excessive smoking and beinge drinking to water myself down some?
