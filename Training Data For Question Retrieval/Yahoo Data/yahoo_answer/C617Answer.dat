Yeah.. I'm 20 now, I never did any of that crap and I don't plan on it.    Your mother needs to have a little faith in you as a person and if you haven't done anything crazy in the past, she has no real reason to expect you to.|`|UIA7aw0jaa	I wouldn't be to upset about it. That's how most moms are. I think the best thing you should do is continue to prove to her how trustworthy you are. If its really bothering you, ask her reason behind her commenting you like that and just say, "I really feel like I am doing a great job and I am a trustworthy person, by what you're saying, you make me feel otherwise.. is there anything I can do to prove to you that I have a good head on my shoulders and that  I am a good person." Just come out and ask her, don't make her mad because it might get worst. She just loves and cares about you and she knows how teenage boys are. She probably doesn't want you to make any mistakes that she might as made as well, or she doesn't want you to descend in your school work due to a boy. Yeah, you should just ask her though and I hope it gets better! Good luck! :]
WDL0BWjmaa	Dont know of any books, but when I started dating mt bf his daughter was 3.  First of all,  dont interfere with the decisions that both parents will be making.  Keep neutral.  You can voice your oprinions to your bf, but not to the ex. Be friends with the ex.  No matter what happened in their relationship, she hasnt done anything to you to treat her poorly. And have fun with the child.  Read, play games, do crafts, make her fav foods but make the time she with the 2 of you about the child.  Just remember that the child comes first and you have to be adult.  Just last week my bf's ex gave me a hug and thanked me for helping to raise her daughter ( is now 19).  She told me that she didnt like the idea of her child spending time with me, but when her child came home happy and healthy she felt better.  It brought tears to our eyes.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	You don't need any books, just move with the flow.

Sometimes  not  answering  is  the  best  answer.  As  for  x  that's  hard  say.  Try  to  work  together  but  make  it  clear  each  house  has  rules to  follow.  Plan  family  activities  to  strengthen  bonding,  games,picnic,   movie  night,  so  on. Compliment  the  strenths  and  try  not  nag  on  weakness.

AA10065812	*** As for his Will, it's registered with the probate court.  Just go there and look at it.  As for her Will, that's none of your business.    He has the right to pass on his estate to whom ever he wishes.  Unless you can prove he was not in his right mind when he did, than you have no say in it, unless you want to make a lawyer losts of money suing, with no guarantee of winning.    Unless you helped build his estate, such as running or working in a family owned business, estates are not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  If you want to achieve what he had, you work for it, just like he did.    I'm currently the patented owner of a new type of self supporting security system for taxi cabs.  It's a system that's easy to install and will cost them nothing to use.  Better yet, it will make them money.      When I die, if it pays off, most of my estate it go to a non-profit association for inventors.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	go to the executor/executrix of the will.

If so, state laws would protect your right to your dads estate.  But, as others have suggested, you need a lawyer.|`|Q1fJIgYsaa	The history of family members who were not legal heirs to a parents estate is usually negative.    I would try to communicate pleasantly with the other family members about the future of the estate and disassociate yourself from ANYONE who is displaying bad humor about the situation - always be reasonable and optimistic. It is very important to think positively because that which you think about increases - so look on the bright side always.    If you do decide to throw money at the problem by hiring a lawyer, go to your library and look for a book titled "The Best Lawyers in America". Would you hire one from a book "Average Lawyers in America" ? Your money and time will be well spent and you can take comfort that you gave this your best shot with a great attorney.    If you do not hire a lawyer, just be pleasant and hopeful and see what happens. Something like this is always a good reason to get tough with yourself and decide that you will go out there and make your own money no matter what. Our government has recently demonstrated that there is no shortage of money!    One way to get money from this is to take very good notes and research the situation at the apellate court level. From your experience and research you may then write an eBook to other people who may also be the children of divorce telling them what they should do before it is too late. Every time someone buys your eBook, money will be automatically deposited into your account even while you are sleeping.

945Wewnyaa	awww you are so sweet for wanting to help.    I think that there is not all that much you can do, as it's really up to the parents.    What you can do is when you see her to make her feel special. Try to talk to her about things she is interested in, or offer to take her out for ice cream or watch DVDs with her or something.    Important thing is you mentioned she is spoiled. So maybe although you should try to make her feel special, don't go overboard and indulge her temper tantrums. Make sure you are firm and say that beong mean to her sister is not OK, but I think you right; probably having some special attention of her own will cure her of that :)|`|a341c10e4b45d0b72a48cbb360934201aa	Maybe you can take  your cousin somewhere special.

ZIq2IzOmaa	Sometimes couples fight over stupid little things when they are really angry about something else. If you're angry about money, spending time together, wanting time to yourselves, or something else and are avoiding it, it's very easy to get hurt and fight over little stuff.     Even if you're not angry over something big, some couples fight because one (or both) of them feels ignored. One of the easiest ways to get attention and feel like the other person cares about you is to yell at each other and then make up. So if you're not feeling like she's paying enough attention to you, you may be more prone to getting your feelings hurt.     Appoligizing for hurtful things that you've said while your angry is what ADULTS do in a relationship. Sulking off by yourself until your partner comes groveling is not the mature way to be a couple.     But, when you have a geniune problem or have really gotten your feelings hurt you need to talk to her about it, not just appologize so everyone is happy again.     Instead of yelling or accusing and saying mean things, you need to tell your girlfriend why you are hurt. Don't beat around the bush or just try to hurt her back, but explain what happened and why you are upset.     For example: She has left her wet bathtowel on the floor for the thousandth time instead of in the hamper. You trip over it in the middle of the night. You feel like she has no respect for your house or your stuff and that she's just walking all over you.     So in the morning you say something snotty. She doesn't know what's going on and says something mean back. She doesn't know that you tripped on her towel last night and nearly broke your neck. She just knows you're being a jerk this morning.     Instead of ruining the whole day, just tell her what happened AND how it made you feel. Let her know that you're insulted when she can't do little things to clean up after herself and that it really makes a big difference to you when she cares enough to tidy up. She may not realize the towels on the floor are a huge issue. You have to tell her so she understands why you're all upset.     You have to learn to talk to each other and sort out what's really wrong to keep a relationship strong. When you're fighting over every little thing, it's time to look at the real problem.|`|FEfUqngJaa	tell her how you feel|`|aWP9SqRbaa	stop being a baby.. girls hate crybabies..|`|TBbf0dQZaa	sounds like me and my husband...!!!!  just chill...give it some time...do u really love her or u just feel attracted to some aspect of hers...?! that might make u feel u really love her...!!!  we fight over dumb things too and he's the one to apologise 1st...look...saying a simple sorry doesnt really hurt...!! try to explain to her that u feel hurt when she does such things...tell her u really love her and dont wanna lose her...!! (das wot we do...!!!)  good luck...!!|`|SXWbG2Eqaa	if she's really worth it, and you both love eachother, talk it out. that's the only way to fix things.|`|Ed2Y5djjaa	My Boyfriend and i fight over dumb things,  & Most times its my fault because im insecure and i think he might leave me for another girl. Thats just how we girls are.    Just ignore the fights,hug her, and make her feel loved.    *When shes about to scream or argue with you just Kiss Her.    :) Hope i helped.|`|EprpvMclaa	dude people are gonna tell you alot of things but please listen to me i just went through stuff like this and me and my girl are broken up and that hit me really hard....look dont let the fighting happen were guys we have ego's we get cocky and full of ourselves its just how we are you got to let some stuff go even when you know she is wrong for the sake of your relationship.....women really do rule the world you got to let her win some of these battles so that you dont end up in another dumb little fight cause trust me they add up they really do and if it keeps happening she is gonna go off. Just take it cool be easy and sensitive when you feel something is going down and talk stuff out calmly before it gets out of hand...if you love this girl and you do this you wont get hurt trust me i went through the EXACT same thing follow that advice and i promise you i really do you can stop that stuff from happening and you two can grow closer|`|YdcvbeKCaa	Don't fight over stupid things it only shows that both of you are stupid, let her be the stupid one and not you, then love that stupid girl and you will be the next stupid. Right answer?|`|bRkhq7Rhaa	well, sounds like you really care about her!  remember a relationship should be a two way thing, if there is a problem between you two then it takes the two of you to fix it.  when things get calm, ask her to take some time and sit and chat with her a little to straighten things out for the health of your relationship.  it'll be good for the both of you.      don't try to make things complicated, or think or if as a complicated thing, that will just make things worse.  hey, who knows, maybe she's on her monthly pms!|`|pizsAvupaa	Same thing with my friendz (they a "couple") they were on and off for 3 years cause they would fight 4 no reason...now they recently broke up 4 sure...|`|HikylB4Taa	Well relationships are a 50-50 compromise! If you are doing all the giving and her all the taking you might want to ask yourself if this is the way you want to live your life. You really need to talk to her and ask her the same thing! Man, where were you when I needed that!?!?!|`|agTCqkLDaa	You are the guy.  F*** all this gender equality, P.C. b.s.  You are in the right by going to her, but as that does not seem to be working the way you'd like, maybe bring her flowers next time or show up at her door or plan a nice dinner for her.    Secret to girls:  Romance  Candles  Flowers  Romance  Chocolate  Romance  Romance  Romance      All those guys in the movies? (Noah Calhoun=The Notebook, Edward Cullen-Twilight, Prince Charming=every Disney movie ever made....we don't grow out of wanting to find him.  So just take heed and be as close to that as possible...)|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Well then you need to find someone else!|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	you gotta be zen
NvW6voPJaa	If you want to do the above listed things, I would presume you want to do them when it's light outside, so I would say the perfect time would be around 12 Noon and then you can have a lunch and do all of the other things during the afternoon.    It all depends on what people want to do.  If their main focus is a nice dinner, then   5 p.m. would be a nice time.  But for you....I would say 12 Noon would be ideal for your activities.|`|jcTnOE8uaa	Usually people pick about 1pm so that its giving ppl time to get all fancy if they need to before, it gives you time, but then those with kids can get back to them early enough if needed also.|`|aMGfRum0aa	Late afternoon! That sounds great. Congratulations to you both!|`|F7O0nLK1aa	mine is St. Patrick's Day, March 17th. and the wedding is at 4pm.    CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|EAvyYtfXaa	I live in Florida and my wedding is march 8th March and April are the best for FL|`|xyQRD8ahaa	Dear friend,  it all depends on the kind of people coming to party!    Cost cutting would be to choose a time close to the noon, so that you need not spend a lot on electricity.But if you deiced to dance, it's better to choose the evening, between 4 and 6, so that the dance party can take place after the wedding in the shades of sunset!!    Congrats to both! Wish you a Happy Married Life!
oaQ8Tuhjaa	yeah peoples personalities are different    if both of you were always wanting to talk to eachother 24/7 imagine how  boring that would be|`|XbaH5sGbaa	i guess i'd have to hear the background story. like- are you two in a long distance relationship, are you suspicious that he's cheating on you?|`|fyyzKKqpaa	wel guys can be like taht but sometimes it can be a sign that the "spark" is gone. That's what happened with my ex-bf, and I broke up with him after. My new bf is ALWAYS the first to text and to start a conversation and I like it that way. ;-) play it hard to get !|`|eqWftUQeaa	Like how long of while are you talking? I mean if a day or two goes by without u guys talking and you get kinda upset that is understandable. But if you get all bent out of shape because a couple of hours go by and you haven't heard from him, than I think you are the one who needs to do some changing and rethinking.|`|JAwhXqljaa	Text him first..maybe hes busy or something...and dont overeract|`|wFWytGlxaa	Why don't you text/call him every once in awhile?    Just my 2 cents!|`|ti97SKNSaa	I deal with girls with a similar problem very often. A piece of advice I can give you is to just try and respect his space, men think and feel very different than women in many aspects in life.  Hope this helps!|`|Y2Jjwe6Taa	don't break up with him over a silly thing like that.  why don't YOU text HIM?  or just let him know again that you'd like to keep in  touch all day|`|2F4vkfnxaa	well why don't you text him first.  guys like it when u do that every once in a while.|`|anC0pVOQaa	this used to happen between my ex and me, he would go a day or two without saying anything...it really frustrated me, because i was constantly thinking about him, why wasn't he thinking about me? but to tell you the truth, some peoples brains just do not work the way ours do. if he is going days or weeks at a time not acknowledging you, then yes something needs to be done, but if it isn't long periods of time it really isn't worth the stress of fighting over. sometimes you just need to pick your battles, this probably isn't worth losing your boyfriend over.|`|XUDsWuTQaa	Just Chill! I'm like that but I'm trying to control it. I do miss my guy like crazy and when he do writes to me I feel so relief, but still I don't let him know I'm anxious to hear from him!|`|v1a5Zr07aa	"If you love something,let it free.." .Men don't like women or specially their girlfriends text or call them too much or make things complicated.Let him free,control your mind out of those soft emotions,and of course-control him-but in a smart way. ;)
GeHxekEMaa	SO WAHT AS LONG AS HIS FACE IS GORGEOUS AND HE HAS A KIND HEART ID MARRY THE DOUCHE|`|S852p6SXaa	well i wouldn't drop him just like that  cause thats low, but i would be VERY disappointed.|`|DHapsa7Daa	I'm not going to lie.  I would honestly have to be madly in love with him.  Size matters, just like to guys.  If the girl doesn't have a butt, she better have the boobs.  If she doesn't have the boobs, she better have the butt.  If she doesn't have either, she better at least be pretty in the face.  I mean seriously?    Girls care just as much as guys -- we just disguise to seem "sweeter".  That's like saying, "Would you date a girl with a loose vagina".  How can you please someone if you don't like what they have?  That's like living with a girl that laughs at every little thing all the time.  You can't change her, you just have to move on.    What I would do? If I was in love, stay.   If I knew he wasn't who I would marry,   I would just leave and tell him, being friends is best.|`|0e999f5ffc3b68a26b333974da10ffbdaa	if you are going to let a rumor abotu the size of a guys penis stop you from wanting to go out with him, then you are really really shallow. size doesnt matter, its whats in the heart that counts.|`|813e4ae08051a83b82d19022e31f3510aa	I would be his friend, because first I was attracted to his personality. I could not be intimate with him and yes size does matter, even more when they do not know how to use what they have.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Find out if he can truly work the penis. If not pray that he is good at giving head. If he's a good guy, then see if you guys can get some books and experiment that way. If he is bad in bed, and that's a deal breaker for you then break it off. There is nothing wrong with that, some prefer blondes. If you prefer someone that has a bigger penis, then find that. But I don't think its the end all to being with a guy that is good in other areas. So ultimately, find out what he's working with, and if it ain't good and that's important to you, then call it off. I wouldn't necessarily loose attraction to someone because of the size of the penis. Personally, before I knew how big or small it was I'd be in love so it wouldn't matter to me. I don't go there until im ready to commit and he is too.|`|ORim3Y4Zaa	That would be a major let down  Like 2 in is small even like 4 or five inches but thich would be fine   my ex had a real small one  wel that is what he told me|`|25kAXd2Iaa	Well, i would say invest in a vibrator,     And maybe try it out, the Female g spot is only 2 inches in and up....    Good luck|`|Nrk9fT8waa	It's not always about pleasure. I believe, no matter what, how this guy makes you feel is what makes you stay and continue to stay with him.|`|DaN5STNwaa	it would be disappointing i guess, but that's not the most important thing.|`|GUUa1s6Laa	Yes of course, you can get around the small penis.|`|sm8sWirVaa	been there done that ya id marry him marrage isnt jus about sex u kno|`|ebwe0Duzaa	i could personally care less how big it is.  i hate those pathetic sluts who make a deal out of that.  size definately doesnt matter and of course i would marry someone even if they had a small one!  how you feel about each other is what counts, not so much the appearance and size.|`|dvUx5G2Raa	Wow, what a shallow question. (no offense) I think size shouldn't matter. If he makes you feel amazing and you will never want anyone else, you should marry him. Of course, he has to have a good body and face...but, that shouldn't matter as much as what's inside.     GL, Hope this helps! :]]|`|0OtwboKfaa	Looks && size arent the only thing that matters. Your shallow....|`|jUOa3J4aaa	LMao it doesnt matter   he is still hot right|`|iBKue4JFaa	dude big deal. its about what's inside that matters. if he treats you well, then run with him! there are very few like that|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I would send him to the desert island where they send guys who have small penises.|`|yknytmO3aa	hmmm.  i probably wouldn't be sexually attracted to him..|`|2thQbeAYaa	if you're in love with him size shouldn't matter.  this is the dumbest question ever.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	who cares|`|CeyuSMT9aa	cry then write a book on it|`|v16ylsl8aa	Yeah I would still be attracted to him. I was making out with a guy one time in my dorm and ask to see it. He was small and his penis looked like an inflamed finger. I was still attracted to him and not at all turn off. We didn't have sex because I'm waiting until I'm more mature for sex and a committed relationship. yeah I'm a 19 years old virgin . . .   Of course I would marry a guy with a small penis. I just hope he knows how to use it.|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	Size shouldn't matter...don't be shallow!|`|UtrgRjTeaa	The size of the penis has relatively little to do with whether or not he can satisfy you sexually. Try him out and see if he makes you feel amazing!
yAXrsQiFaa	I think you should have one for emergency purposes.|`|DWE2EI35aa	Tell them that in the event of an emergency, you must have a cell phone for them to reach you or vice versa. Heck that's the reason why my own parents gave my 9 year old sister a cell-phone. So far she has not done anything wrong with/to the cellphone (e.g. drop it, lose it, etc)|`|hplJxGa2aa	Keep asking to use your dads phone! He will get really annoyed and eventually will let you buy a phone! Same with your mom (if she has one).|`|a341c10e4b45d0b72a48cbb360934201aa	Tell them it is for your safety in case you are alone or there is an incident at your school.  Tell them you need to be able to get in touch with them at a moment's notice.  And then DON'T take advantage of it!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	If you are running the streets at all hours, you really need that kind of backup.  If you can afford it, you go down to the local retailer and get a pay-as-you-go plan for yourself. You turn the phone to vibrate before entering the house.  I understand Cricket is cheap.  If you need to make a call home from your cell, tell your parents you are calling from a friend's phone.|`|AA10065812	*** Tell them that you would be willing to get a phone that can only dial numbers they program into it, and receives calls only from family members.|`|vJzCrX88aa	tell them to think of the safety that comes from having a mobile phone|`|nJrw4LRKaa	Let them know that you would like one so that it is easier to get a hold of you.  If they can reach you, they'll know you're okay.  Explain to them that because your schedule is so inconsistent that it would make it easier on everyone if everybody knew what was going on, instead of guessing.|`|f61ebe36568a53824e5d8e2786a3f83caa	A few ideas...    - Appeal to their concern for you. With a phone, they can always reach you and check up on you. What if you're with a friend and their car breaks down and no one has a phone? That sort of thing. Let them see it as a safety matter.    - Maybe start asking your dad if you can borrow his phone once in a while, like when you go out somewhere on a weekend. Don't use the phone, just show that you can be responsible with it. And maybe if he lets you and you keep asking to borrow his, he'll finally get you your own one so he gets his back!    - Ask them for a timeline - like, if you do x, y, and z to prove that you're responsible, you can have a phone. What about by the time you're 17? See if you can find out what they're most worried about (texting while driving, running up the phone bill, etc) and then find ways to assuage those fears.|`|yptfd3sIaa	OK, old fashioned or not - I cannot fathom a mother in the modern world who would not demand her kid have a cell phone (I have 3 kids 18-23). That you are willing to pay for yours makes you really special. So I guess my question is this: what are their reasons? And if they are totally stupid, what would they do if you got your own account? I mean, this is really ridiculous. You shouldn't have to obey stupidity.
fQYU96euaa	His hands and tongue still work right??  No I wouldnt leave, thats a terrible person who would.|`|nFelM9Wtaa	no. i would find other ways that you 2 could please each other. sex is not everything.|`|AA11156037	NO.    So much for the "In sickness and in Health" clause.|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	nope|`|EjID9iWyaa	No, I've been diabetic for 25 years and although I've had my problems I still have sex twice a week.  Have him get a testosterone test and if low get Androgel, it will fix him right up.  Use a **** ring to hold it up too, there is always a way but you need to encourge him.  If all else fails you can use Caverject which could get cold spagetti hard.|`|h9AaGIYEaa	First i think you need to put yourself in their position... How would you feel if you were left over that.    Also if sex was the only thing you had that held your relationship and marriage together then maybe you married for the wrong reasons.|`|TSxbN0Asaa	First off, no I wouldn't leave my spouse. And second, what does diabetes have anything to do with not being able to perform sexually? I know several people who have diabetes and have no problems in that department.|`|Dym1Xfquaa	no I did not leave him but we had to go to the doctor to see if there were some medication available to help the loss of blood flow, we got a temporary solution with the meds. but we also tried toys  a **** ring and oral stimulation which helped me alot. also he stepped up his game in others areas of intimacy until his diabetes was better controlled. but communication is very important and being honest about how you feel and what your expectations are can help with the frustrations you may feel.|`|AA11678629	NO I LOVE HIM TOO MUCH AND WILL STAY NO MATTER WHAT|`|DgWUovrQaa	No.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	No|`|i2V17yi4aa	no i would just get a whole lot of toys :)|`|BC2CNH3jaa	oral|`|DenLZAL1aa	I am sure your wedding vows had the part "Through sickness and health", or did you forget?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No way because that wouldn't be his fault.    Vows say "in sickness and in health" and "for better and for worse".|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	No, there's more to married life than sexual performance.|`|AA12204338	never|`|X1YVUA5oaa	Don't they make pills and stuff that help with that now?|`|1nk8WPrtaa	No, that's messed up|`|CM0C65dtaa	No, I don't think so.  There would have to be other issues.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	no!! thats horrible and shallow|`|wrs4kLReaa	Absolutely not, marriage is for better or worse.|`|f90ca27c686e1316601b6836a8f2e32caa	No, I would just use a vibrator or have some other type of sex such as "manual" haha, or oral.

5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	you said you need to improve your self esteem?   Why are you having to do that. Women should always love how they look - I am sure your boyfriend thinks you look fine and has no problem with whatever you are seeing and probably thinks that you are going to the gym only to get thinner and possibly leave him.. guys do think about that too you know. you both need to sit down and talk about it so that you both know what is going on with the other.   Dont put yourself down with trying to exercise to look better.|`|mBczFuLmaa	Sounds like he may be jealous of you getting in shape, maybe scared that your doing it to eventually ditch him.  Men are weird.  Ask him to be your gym buddy!  That's a good motivator for couples and will allow ya'll to spend that time together.|`|bfpuefouaa	He's really probably just worried about the you flirting with other guys... Maybe invite him to the gym and tell him yall can work out together and show him that you're not interested in anyone there.
bfpuefouaa	Just sit down and gently tell her that if she doesn't wear it then people may start noticing and say something about it... You might need to talk to her she might be having problems with kids making fun of her already for wearing one while all the other girl don't.|`|76nTvO4iaa	What kind of bra is it?

I have even asked the doc about it."|`|mWhIAXqXaa	tell him why you do perverted stuffs and say you have a medical condition and if he's a good guy, he'll understand. also, try to resist those urges|`|hR82rDpwaa	Well maybe before you say some thing stupid or do why don't you tell him i got to go to the bathroom real quick or tell him i'll be back?

oKnwOjLNaa	I had those problems too and I don't think you have to change the way you are. I think it's good for you to stop caring so much about what the crowd may think or say, don't let it hurt you, but concentrate more on making good friends. If you find someone you would like to talk to, do make the effort to start the conversation, and if it's the other who starts, stay there even if it's a bit difficult at the beginning.|`|vc08jEkvaa	The best way to be more outgoing is simply to put yourself out there. Start casual conversations with people with whom you think have a mutual interest. For example, if you hear someone playing some music it you like, take a deep breath and start a convo with them about it. Before you know it, you're the life of the party. But remember not to overdo it, the best thing you can do is just be yourself. Good luck!
pSy88C9paa	Just be there with her. Ask he if she wants to rent and watch a movie or go to one.  Invite her over while you do laundry.  Just encourage her to not be alone.  Being alone always makes it worse.  And if she talks, just listen.  Don't give advise unless she asks.|`|ouX1mubQaa	let her know you care and are always there for her. Tell her she deserves better cuz in most break ups thats usually the case. ICE CREAM! bring up memmories of you two (funny) make her laugh watch a scary movie or a thriller(i find that after a break up a chick flick is the last thing i should watch)  or simply just spend hours talking about how she feels or just about nothing in paticular. If shes up for it go out tonight! go clubbin or somethin blow off some steam let it out! hope this helped!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	tomorrow invite her over for a sleepover. rent movies, eat junkfood, make her laugh. have a good time and just tell her that she doesnt need him anyway and that its funner to hang out with you. or do something else fun, anything to keep her mind off of it.|`|jXpV0CAlaa	my boyfriend and i just broke up... and we are cool with it but i am still sad.....if i were you i would tell her that there must have been a reason and he was not worth her time and her love....if he hurt her like that how could she live the rest of her life with someone that doesn't even like her????? just tell her that and hopefully she will feel better.....give her a HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE hug!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he is a guy and guys are stupid...no offense !!!!!|`|mDILmAXqaa	just be there and support her! its kinda something you have to let time heal but good company and keep her occupied! :) hope everything works out.
n4QSgd7caa	i think you should just try to talk to her and see what's up with her and if she pushes you away just give her some time or just leave her alone for a while...but don't worry she'll probably get through what she's going through and come to you to comfort her|`|n776D1j6aa	Give her flowers.. Make her a card.. Show her you care and that you want to be there for her.. But don't be too pushy or you will push her away..

YsiJiOqXaa	There are lots of thing. Depends on what you like and where you live. Cruises can be cheap if you live near a port but if not maybe think about taking a long road trip to maybe some mountains and staying in a romantic cabin. The mountains would be so pretty in April with all the different colors blooming. We live in florida and we are going to drive to Tennessee and North Carolina. The Tennessee trip includes hotel and 3 days worth of activity anywhere from $400 to $700 depending on how nice you want you hotel. We are just going to leave from there and stay in a nice romantic get a way cabin in North Carolina.  If you consider something like that check out this site.    http://chattanoogapackages.com/    You can never go wrong with the mountains. They are always so beautiful.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	try applevacations.com|`|iOo9MAxJaa	Sex.|`|Q1fJIgYsaa	I would sign up for activities that are about the opposite of sex to give yourself a break.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	Punta Cana all inclusive with flight.

You have amazing beaches and a fabulous nightlife with tons of things to do scuba...relaxing...bacardi tours
QAQTYuIjaa	close your eyes (if you can) and take a deep breath. think of all the good things you can do, and get on with what you were doing|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	Dear one, it's well that you want to do something about your jealousy - in that just because YOU haven't said anything to so-n-so's face, doesn't mean it hasn't gotten back to them somehow. People love to spread bad feelings.     Now then, recognizing you have a problem is the first step to fixing it.     The next step in fixing it is to muster up the desire to fix it. You've done that too.    Now then, I suggest you get some good counseling to see why you have such a self-esteem problem. Low self-esteem is pretty common - and even very attractive people can have a low self-esteem.     And in the meantime, when you hear about so-n-so doing better than you, rather than putting them down with digs etc. ask yourself "What is so-n-so doing that I cand do to make myself better?" "What can I copy from them to improve my own performance."     For example, if so-n-so is making honor roll, maybe they have better study habits than you. SO instead of saying mean things about their skin or their nose or something like that - learn better study habits. Then you'll make good grades too.    Maybe so-n-so just lost 30 pounds and has abs and buns to die for - well, maybe you should ask them about their exercise and diet routine. Then copy it and follow it - so you can be a hottie too.    Get the picture? Yeah, it takes work and plenty of it - but changing this habit of yours (cutting others down to make yourself feel better) is a good thing. Keeping THAT habit is a ticket to misery.     Remember, people will hear you say mean things - and if you'll say mean things about so-n-so - you are just as likely to say mean things about them too.     So change this (with hard work and good counseling) so you won't wind up lonely and alone with no friends.    But you can do it. I know you can. We're pulling for ya!|`|J6JFiNL8aa	your not happy with your life so either learn to deal with it or do something to improve it...its all on u hater!!!|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Learn to be happy for them.|`|0QEeXzOEaa	See if you can do that thing... if you can show off, if not try to ignore it
HfTbzv32aa	sounds like he does|`|zWqKuIQuaa	I think its pathetic that you wasted 10 years of your life, probably the prime of your life, pining over him.  Wait another 10 years and you will become a cat lady who nobody would want to date.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	he probably likes you. there really isn't no way to be sure though because guys just are weird like that lol.  but guys often can act shy too even though they may seem all macho they really are like ..should i talk to her blah blah blah and all that.    often i notice guys even will play the same games we do as in "i'll ignore her to see if she notices" kind of game.  or he will ignore you to see if you care.  so it looks like he likes you =)    i wish you the best!|`|cl6r8cGBaa	i tend to act aloof if i really like someone.  i think he really likes you.|`|ctj3tFEMaa	guys are different.     he could be doing this because your sending him distant signals and he's trying to get your attention.    or he could be doing this because he thinks you dont like him(you giving him distant signals), so he's trying to give up.    the only way to find out is ask him...      answer mine please...http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|HtHFHfDKaa	He seems like he is being shy too. If you know his locker number and it isn't in the boys locker room when no one is looking slip a note into his locker but write it before you leave the house otherwise you might get into trouble with the teacher and get embarrassed in front of the whole class.|`|BMArzuJUaa	If he called you pretty he probably likes you...|`|DHapsa7Daa	10 years of your life wasted.. seriously.  Go up to him, tell him you like him  If he doesn't like you 10 years wasted.  If he does, 10 years you two could've been dating.|`|uKEDfFHWaa	he might still like you, he probably is just doing this cause you did it to him but i were you i would flat out tell him you like him.|`|Nrk9fT8waa	What are you waiting for? Another 10 years to pass to not tell him how you truly feel? If you guys are quite good friends though, I suggest you look that over and make sure it doesn't ruin the friendship you already have.  Guys tend to always tease as their way of affection, no matter how they try to hide it, so I definitely think there is a connection for you there! notevery guy has the guts to just call a girl precious out of nowhere!|`|813e4ae08051a83b82d19022e31f3510aa	He probably thinks that you do not like him because of the way you having been acting towards him. No one likes rejection so I would say he is playing it safe and staying away from you. If you like him why not invite him to do something with you and your friends, so you will not have to be alone him unless you want to. Bowling, skating, laser tag, movies, pizza or something.|`|0e999f5ffc3b68a26b333974da10ffbdaa	it sounds liek he used to really really like you, btu was so unsure of your feelings for him that he just... gave up. i would talk to him about it. be totally striaghtforward, even if its awkward.|`|1awiFO6paa	well i am not sure he like u still  but at some point he did and if u started acting distant towards him well he probably thinks you dont like him no more and he is just trying to get distant so both wont get ur feelings hurt  but y dont u talk to him and just tell him wat u feel   i think it is time to let out ur true feelings  although this could also be risky because wat if he miht not like you  but think about it this way  if he is acting strange around you you've got nothing to loose i mean he is already acting strange as it is so if u tell him wat u feel its not like he will start acting differrent cuz he already is  just try it ask if there is anything wrong because before it usedd to be like that and now it is like this...  dnt be afraid  let him know how u feel|`|kwF5ItCSaa	Just go up to him and ask him, even though you're nervous and all, go for it, I'm in the same situation as you are. Just think the positive way and think that he likes you. If he acts strange around you, he probably figured out that he has feelings for you or he knows you really like him but he doesn't, and he's trying not to do/say anything overboard, so that you won't like him to much, because he'll end up getting u rejected. just as I said, don't let the facts hold you down     THINK THE POSITIVE WAY|`|FlUKDytMaa	i think he liked you but then he pleasured himself to you and now he cant look you in the eye|`|3NAwWRMyaa	I think it's pretty possible he likes you. You should definitely tell him and see what happens.  Remember everything happens for a reason. If he doesn't like you, oh well. Just try to move on.|`|UJjYM9QVaa	wow, the guy sounds like me haha, and now i've been goingout with the girl for 3 months so far, so i'd say he likes you, especially if he called you preety, try and send a signal to him that you like him, or ask a friend that you have in common to go ask him if he likes you, but dont tell the friend to let him know that you had the idea, and see how it all works out. as a last resort, jsut make the move yourself, worst that can happen is he says no and you dont have to worry about it for another 10 years.|`|jUOa3J4aaa	He likes you   Dont waste your time wondering of what if he liked me and how would have it been if we went out  Just go for it and be like hey i like you  and dont be shy its a waste of living the life:)|`|7a120ffae1bf1ee1880ae9b42f59195daa	Yeah, I know I would act different too. If a girl acts like she doesn't like you then you don't want really want to act that you like her in that case. He probably still likes you or it's too late and he's thinking of moving on.|`|uz8n7Vq0aa	You should break the ice... ask him out! make shure you dont constantly flirt with him though    good luck|`|FpiwrF5paa	i really think that he does... but im sorry if he doesnt.. ten years gone|`|E8XhWvdqaa	how old are you? no offense, but you sound like you're in like, 7th grade. but you couldn't be, unless you started liking him in preschool, in which case, that is really sad.|`|sm8sWirVaa	i think he really doesan being shy is cute so he'll eventually get it an if he seems that into u maby you should talk about takeing ur guyses friendship to the next level frm what you told me it seems like jus mentioning it would do alot for you an him   hope i helped goodluck|`|sVMSyRfBaa	yes he has maybe as you got older he got shy to be around you tell you bff to tell him that you like him and maybe he'll make his move|`|X6C6kZKKaa	i think he is also shy. he has done what ever he knows what to do. but your shyness is in your way.and if you don't make your move. someone will.|`|U5d075o7aa	He may get vibes from you that you are not interested. This happens, so in return he does not want to seem as if hes 'too' interested. So he may give confusing vibes. I say if you like a guy, the best way to get him is to SHOW him you are interested! I know it is hard since you are shy, but breathe deeply a couple times, Remind yourself to have some confidence, and push the 'real' you out, it helps!     i think he is into you, but dont scare him away with your shyness.  Show your interest back.GOOD LUCK.      i posted a question up today.  If you could give advice in return, thatd be sweet :]|`|GLLVqwa2aa	id say that ten years of liking him was way too long. you said that he used to like you. he was probably waiting for you to make a move. id say this was his fault though because the guy is usually expected to make a move first. he was waiting and waiting until he lost interest. this happens and sometimes, they start liking you again... but once he started getting over you, he probably found out that you've liked him for TEN years. this probably freaked him out. im sure he was thinking... wow. why didn't she tell me or do anything when i liked her. to preserve your own dignity, i think you should forget the feelings you have toward him. ten years of nothing isn't going anywhere. im sure there are other guys that would like to go out with you and i know you have some guys you've thoughtttt about going out with ;D trust me... it takes more energy and heartbreak to love a person for so long than it does to get over them and start anew.|`|QKnilCNDaa	hes over u. dont worry things like this happen. one second a guy loves u more than anything, and the next he cant even remember ur name. thats life.|`|LNEWbymsaa	Its very possible that he likes you.... i think he does... when somone has liked you before they can defanatley like you again and if he thought you were pretty than it gives him even more of a reason that he should like you|`|qByfsv8qaa	Yea I would say he does like you if he called you Baby girl, and pretty but did you really like this guy for ten years I wouldn't do that,well it depends on the type of girl it is. So my decision is he likes you     Bye|`|VSeJBwDGaa	i think he's just over you, sorry|`|iBKue4JFaa	he likes you but doesnt think you like him. tell him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sZAzoBTcaa	Okay, take it from me that I have gone through this WAYY to many times to count.  I've liked a guy for 4 years and he does the same thing. Recently we talked about everything, like how i feel about him and i really don't want him to lead me on etc and i think it helped a lot! you really just need to sit down with him and lay down the law. plan it out ahead of time! just be like look, this is how i feel about you, im not sure how you feel about me since you're sending me mixed signals but i think its about time we set things straight..you really shouldnt be racking your brain on this anymore, its been far too long sweetie. now depending on his answer, if he likes you too, ask him where things are gonna go, and figure things out from there. if he doesnt, ERASE his number from your phone for a bit, go out clubbing and seriously find someone else thats worthy because you deserve someone who realizes what hes got in front of him and wont treat you like that. 10 years!? seriously.|`|PJtK5wf2aa	Ten years gives you plenty of time to expand your imagination. You get so lost in thoughts and dreams and wishes and hopes of you and him that you dont know whats real anymore. even though he was never actually in your life you feel like he is a part of it. And holding on to something so long is that much harder to let go and doesnt even sound like an option anymore and when you see something from him your mind automatically(withought you wanting) goes in the direction that its used to going for the past ten years and defines something in a certain way that brings you closer to him. Now dont get me wrong, im not saying he doesnt like you im just saying that because youve liked him for so long its harder to see things as they really are when it comes to him. So take a step back, breathe, and observe withougt the sun in your eyes.
GBYyjXPiaa	i feel really bad for you! well since im a girl i can help you out here.  first of all, just talk to her, get to know her. what i like is to txt a guy, that really shows there personality because it might be hard to ask in person and i understand that. then maybe do that for awhile and then just talk at school.  when you feel comfortable enough ask her to the MOVIES NOT DINNER. but dont ask her in front of her friends! it feels awkward and puts the girl in a weird situation. its all yours from here! good luck and if you have any other questions email me at stillhottayxoxo@yahoo.com|`|PDYiwb3Raa	Ok well... She is most likely getting her friend to ask you that so they can clue that she likes you and she is waiting because usually boys make the first move. Go ask her and when you ask her don't mention that her friends were asking you that or she'll feel embarrassed. Yeah it's perfectly fine if you just go and ask her out because you've been giving her hints that you like her. Just be brave.    P.S. she'll be stuttering too. People usually do that when there nervous. Don't be mean and act sweet.|`|O7eAkeBhaa	Take a chance. Ask her out|`|kfg1Sw72aa	Strike up a conversation with her, and somewhere in it ask if she'd like to hang out when she's not busy. after the first time you could ask her if she'd like to go to a movie or something. she might just be waiting to be asked by you. so don't waste your time..|`|KRDEbZmIaa	LMFAO AHAHAHHAHAHHA    *cough* chorry its a funny answer o-o    well yo we are all human and its best if u ask someone in person not online    cuz u see well...i don't see the girl    everyone think girls r pinky like pussycat doll etc etc  but I HATE PINK N EWWWWWWWW WUT THE HEAK WITH CAT!    so i would say...talk with one of ur friend if u dont have one the ur bro  if u dont have a bro then ur sis, if u dont have a sibling THEN UR PARENTS :DDD (if its not crazy enough for ya o-o)    just saying u gotta share it with some one, letting out the feeling is good :D    as for the girl, talk with who ur sharing     -pray to god (if ya believe in one e_o)  -close your eyes then JUST ask her :D|`|ISu2Hn6Vaa	I kow how you feel but sometimes people like to pay with other peoples emotions just make sure she likes you if your not sure don't bother there are other fish in the sea good luck buddy!|`|EkSYnj6Caa	okay dont ask someone out enless you know they like you atleast a little....Bring it up and ask her if she likes you at all,And if not it would be okay to be friends(reguardless what you think)|`|DptEIDiPaa	aww you sound really sweet and you must really like this girl. if her friends talk to you about her, then the girl wants to find out how you feel about her. why dont you tell her yourself? just find her when she's alone (much easier) and tell her your feelings! its not that hard, especially when you know that she likes you too. so just take a deep breath and ask her already!|`|PATpTF9saa	good lord bro i'm in the same spot. i'm not sure if i should ask her to movie or if that's too formal and date like. i don't know what to FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...|`|kpIjnphEaa	wow. well from what i can tell she has definitely talked about it with her friends. im assuming that if she said bad things they wouldn't encourage you to talk to her so much. you really need to just relax and casually ask her to a movie or something. If your not ready for that just initiate conversation. find things she likes. inside jokes are good for breaking the ice so dont be embarassed if you mess up just laugh it off. it sounds like you really like her so you need to do something about it. if you just sit in uncertainty you will get worse and worse emotionally. be proactive and do something about it or you will drive yourself crazy haha. good luck!|`|FYglstUdaa	wen dey ask u hav u tlked 2 her yet dey mean hav u told her bout ur feelings or anythin like dat...... i think u shud go 4 it u cnt hold urself bak it wud haunt u wen she has another bf.... go up 2 her Nd tell her all ur feelings den tell her i hope u feel da same way bout me so wud u go out wit me......OR u cud send ur friend ova 2 her Nd tell him 2 ask her if she likes u more den a friend but no suspiciously orelse she'll noe Nd u gotta act like u hav no idea ur friend is goin ova dere......dats probably it      *tell me wat happens!!!!!!*|`|kQB8u1cCaa	CONFIDENCE is the key here. I really like the idea that you have of going up to her and her friends at lunch and asking her about her weekend plans ("Hey _______, What are you up to this weekend?")     Ever see that commercial for cars.com where the kid goes up to the older girl and just gives her his number and tells her to call, and it works? Well that's the mindset that you need to have. Just approach her and be totally confident in what you are going to say. Look her in the eye. Good luck!|`|TurlSdfZaa	get to know her better by taking any chance you get to talk to her dont ask her out until you think you have bonded and became good friends you sound like a really nice guy and if you ask her out i hope she says yes|`|GYflLwCyaa	I am a girl and i swear i can totally relate to u! Its the same exact thing for me...i think you should talk to her alone in person and ask her if she wants to hangout some time...take her to dinner or the movies maybe even both! Talk to her, get to know her more...try not being shy around her..i know its hard...but u can do it! Talk to her as if your talking to a friend. It hit me relly hard when the guy i liked said that i need to talk more...i am relly shy too...and now i actually stopped listening to those annoying voices in my head that kept me from opening up. I talk to him more its actually helps to think of the person just as a friend..the more u talk to her and open up the more interested she will be. If u say ur not shy then u wont be! Trust me it totally works! Just dont pay too much attention to those annoying voices in your head ok? Good luck! I hope u both become an awesome couple :]|`|RJlaACWBaa	well if you wanna ask her out, dont ask her infront of her friends, do it when shes alone, like by her locker? or something. Or go on a group date, and ask her out their. But if you really like her as much as you say you do, ask her. Before its too late.|`|IavvEVWbaa	Well, you should probably just be yourself, if you act more like you- and she really likes you-it will be much easier.  I think that if you were to talk to her in front of all her friends at her lunch table she may think your brave and maybe not be able to say no...  If you talk to her in private she may think you were romantic.  and by talk yes i do mean ask her out...  If you get yourself too excited then she may have second thoughts...  and be ready for rejection, you never know what going on in her mind and she may only like you as a friend.  If she says yes don't start jumping up and down all excited that may embarrass her. Just be cool.|`|ar06i7cIaa	Dude just ask her, her friends are obviously telling you that you are too shy dude. Like dude just go for it, you will be fine. Even if you are nervous or shy just say it. Trust me knowing is better than wondering. I mean just go for it. I love it when a guy has the guts to tell me how he feels and even though I reject all of them,lol (I am still waiting for the special one that I like to ask me out,lol) I love to have known that they had some confidence within themselves to say something about how they felt or whatever. This girl obviously would appreciate if you spoke up and her friends comments make it that much more obvious. Like my friends would say something like that to a dude, if I liked the dude, so yeah go for it.   You do seem really nice, I am sure you will get through with your feelings and do your thing and she will appreciate it.  If I was you, I would say (You dont need to say the exact words) " I am sitting (talking) with you because we dont talk often, so I am willing to change that, What is your favorite color? (Keeping it easy and funny) Answer (Whatever like Pink) Okay and I was wondering if you will like to go out with me sometime and get to know what my favorite color is?"  OR   I really like you and I was wondering if we could hang out sometime?    Hope I helped dude. If anything else I could help with or clear up, Email me for anything, I would love to help out with anything and also keep me updated!!! Hope I helped!!!
BC2CNH3jaa	Here's some charmers that will get her back:    1. Threaten to commit suicide.  2. Tell her you only had 1 affair, not 12, and it was an accident.  3. Her dead kitty in the disposal was an accident.  4. The online porn thing was an accident, and was really her fault.  5. You found the remote and figured out how to use it.  6. Your on a diet, and plan to loose 100 pounds.  7. Beer and whiskey are no longer your favorite breakfast.    If this doesn't work, watch the Christian fire movie thing, I'm sure that will do the trick.  Whatever you do, don't change yourself, take responsibility, or grow up.|`|xbISxnmfaa	This post is a joke because it is just tooooo ridiculous.|`|o1yy6KABaa	no but you can work on your truth and honesty issues you seem to have|`|icxNAOVcaa	lmao  i hope everything works out for you and shim|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The trolls should poop in your pablum.|`|hs793CCxaa	You punched your Father in law in the balls.... at least you are the right height for your age!     Time to go back to the sandpit and play with the other kiddies....|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!!!!!!  damn funny stuff!!!!!|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Just send him a copy of this list, who wouldn't want to come back to such a wonderful relationship.|`|TnXjfM92aa	i never thought that God create a man like you?! Not to mention that somebody ever loved you...get help! Seek some psychiatry..you morron!
KSAbA57Haa	You are not alone.   Never felt the need to make a party out of loving.|`|KNVjK6Qfaa	In the first place why would a college or university have "sex week"! This is disgusting. Sex is something that is suppose to be intimate not a public display, and especially around children omg
KOtL46s8aa	Sadly that was one of the reasons for my impending divorce--a small reason--others were much more important, but for me, "words" are a main source of affirmation. Unless I specifically asked my husband if I looked ok, I would get nothing. Even then, I sometimes got "You're going to wear that?" or "Well, if that's all you've got." (I'm NOT a bum or slob.)    Read "The 5 Languages of Love" if you get a chance. It may not solve any problems--both people would have to read it and talk about it for that to occur--but at least you will find yourself better able to understand your own needs and those of your husband.     Good Luck.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Ditto the first person that answered this. Us women always feel that a guy has to let us know that we are appreciated or beautiful, but what about them? People only put in a relationship what they get back from the other person, its a two way street.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Not at all. But are you dressing nice for him? Doing your hair and makeup? Spraying perfume on yourself? If you are just being a plane jane, then don't look for him to complement anything.|`|DenLZAL1aa	If he doesn't feel he should, If you have to ask him to compliment you, then he would be lying.|`|fzIeGPZYaa	absolutely not!!! both people in a relationship should compliment each other, it just shows your paying attention and you appreciate what you have|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Its definately too much to ask.  In fact I think it should be expected.  It help morale and just plain shows love.    You dont need to wear nice clothes and do your make up everyday either.    I always tell my wife I love her, I tell her she is pretty, I tell her she is gorgeous, I do compliment her when she shows me new clothes or a new style of hair.    I am also honet with her.  If she buys something that really doesnt look good on her I tell her the truth and she wouldnt want it any other way.    I know my wife loves the compliments and I love giving them out.    Read some great relationship articles at the site below|`|f90ca27c686e1316601b6836a8f2e32caa	Compliments are nice and I think that spouses and couples should remember to compliment each other because it makes the other person feel special and give them the attention we all crave.    Although, be carefull not to let compliments effect how you feel about yourself.  Confident women don't need to be told this all the time because they know there worth without needing to be reminded.    Also, maybe your man has just been preoccupied or stressed.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Why would you want to be complimented by my man?|`|JUEkTETAaa	no he shoule do it for u and u for him|`|JH6oCuUZaa	I think you are complaining instead of communicating with your guy.|`|AA11646252	No just have to both of you get in the habit of doing this every day.    rd|`|mzkfSwLwaa	lol it depends|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Its really sad  when you are married and still have a lonely spot in your heart an unfilfulled need that is not met.  Some men are just not naturally sensitive to our needs.  They are not verbal and sometimes just plain forget we need that.  I think that is why sistas are so important to keep in contact with. there are just things you get and give with your friends that hubby doesnt.    On the other hand make a list of the things he does do. The things you love and appreciate about him.  Read it to him and go into detail about why those things means so much to you. At the end ask him how that makes him feel.  Then tell him you need that too that you cant read his mind and it would mean so very much to hear why he loves you every day. Tell him you really need this from him.    good luck sweetie.|`|RQ83sP4paa	Not too much to ask, but possibly too much to expect from a lot of men!    Insensitive b.....s a lot of us. Got a lot to learn, and unfortunately what men need to know is not compulsory learning prior to marriage!|`|agTCqkLDaa	Apparently.  I had a very similar conversation with my guy a few days ago and haven't heard from him since Tuesday.        I only wish I was joking.|`|579679132804a945bdd947efd600d9dbaa	No.  He also needs to be complimented once in a while.
iBKue4JFaa	um i dont think you should just go up to  her and be like yo i  have.... go on a couple dates if possible, and with casual conversation, tell her.  make it so she understands that youve accepted it and its not that big of a deal. if she knows that and youre a nice guy, then that certainly shouldnt matter!|`|k9KJrjLxaa	Awe, don't be ridiculous. Most people have some sort of downside to them, and she'd most likely accept this with stride. You shouldn't need to lie about something. She would want to hear the honest truth, as do most people. Don't fret so much. =]|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	as long as you don't froth at the mouth as a side effect, just tell her what they are for.  you'll be fine|`|nqMOh2dCaa	tell her the truthhhhhhhhhhhhhh      then see how she reacts and if shes good then ask her outtttt|`|uwtuavULaa	If you want to win her over, you need to start by telling her the truth. Explain though that the medicine controls it.|`|MjFVoFXdaa	I think you should tell her the truth. If she likes you it shouldn't matter. I don't think its that big of a deal. It wouldn't bother me 2 date someone with epilepsy. (especially if its controlled) Good Luck.|`|kOABLsK5aa	hey ask her out after a little tell her about it and if she isnt kool with it then you prob shouldnt be with her ya know
lQmGDPIoaa	That sounds very cool. Man that would be awesome. If you say "your the only one for me" that will give him the right message. It will be cool. That would be sweet very creative. No that should work.|`|xHy7ZjI8aa	awwwwww...that's the most adorable idea i've ever heard of. :)|`|Nm7Hy67oaa	Yeah, uhm, no.  Most men do not think in complex circles like us women.  Chances are, he will say it is awesome and sweet and roll his eyes behind your back, then give you a kiss, your teddy bear and chocolates and pray he can keep the fish alive so you don't rag on him later.  :)  Besides, you should know better than anyone else if he is insecure, not your friend.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	I thought that was sweet.  If you're giving him a card then he's not going to think of anything but you.  If I got that, I'd be so into you it wouldn't be funny but then I'm not all guys.  I'm a little old fashioned and that would make my day.    Hope this helps.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I can't imagine this would make someone feel insecure; I think it's a cute idea.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	No, you put a disclaimer in your message when you said "you're the only one for me." I would be flattered by it, I definitely would take that in a good way. No worries, it's creative, go with it. :)|`|RETpCHipaa	no thats really good. its just saying that of all men in the world he's the only one for you. i wouldn't give him the real fish though unless he likes fish.|`|caArlzCvaa	lol i think its a very cute idea. The first thing that came out of my mind is "awww..." :]    sure there are alot of fish in the sea, but he was a special lil fishy that u find amazing.    i dont seem to find any bad side to this :]|`|gSwobfujaa	i dont think he would get insecure about that. if you really think about it there are lots of guys out there, lots. so you telling him that out of all the single guys out there you only want him. but if you are genuinely concerned this will freak him out you could reword it a little bit...    you could say "there are many other fish out there, but youre the best catch"    thats still catchy. but i say follow your original one. its something you came up with and he should appreciate u for the things u come up with. i seriously doubt he will misconstrue your words.|`|NEEVRp16aa	I think that is a great idea.  Original gifts like that can only improve a relationship.  Go for it.|`|yQn34zO7aa	that sounds like a great idea but i wouldnt give him a real fish that just sounds stupid, maybe inside the bag of goldfish you could have a swedish fish or idk something a guy would want|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Who ever told you that is thinking way too much.  It might just be that they are insecure and they were deflecting their issues onto your situation.  I think your gift idea is unique and thoughtful.  I think he would really feel special because of it.  So my opinion is that you should go with your original, unique and thoughtful concept and give him the fishes.  Trust. ';-)|`|wXQl6sDFaa	nah thats cool, the dude will be so surprised he wont even think about that. lol ur friends thinkeing to hard|`|lZU0XzfTaa	im thinking...  wow  corny.  'great now i have to take care of a d*** fish?'|`|MkM5rtwlaa	Awwh I think that is a super cute idea.  I do see where someone would say that but he shouldn't think that expecially if your not meaning it that way.|`|OVCGjyJbaa	a real goldfish would be freakin weird. but its cute if u dont add the real fish.|`|Zb0deAf4aa	No not at all. In fact it should probably make him feel flattered.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Your friend sounds like a moron. This is corny, but cute. Only the most suicidal of people would take this the wrong way.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	No it's sweet. Only a looney would overanylize this adorable idea.|`|1bvAhTjoaa	awe (: that's such a cute idea , i can't imagine why he would feel insecure ; go for it ! i wish i was that creative ;]|`|AA11155181	I don't think u r sending the wrong message he will love it i say go 4 it|`|2uX45uUQaa	Not at all :D    I thinks it nice, cute, and also creative.  Even if i were insecure, I wouldn' take it the wrong way.   To read "Out of all the fish in the sea, you're the only one for me!", would just make me happy and nowhere even close to worrired about it.    Very nice :]|`|360Gq7Bwaa	that's such a sweet gift. u obviously spent time thinking of something unique to give him and he'll see that and appreciate your present. don't worry about|`|jJwuMTSqaa	My question is...is the fish going to be lying dead in the bowl of goldfish crackers?|`|yGwda7wPaa	If I were super insecure, I might take it the wrong way.  But, most likely, he wouldn't.  Does he like fish?  That is a creative idea.
KOtL46s8aa	June 4, 2006.     My husband's "panic attacks" would not allow him to attend my parent's 50th Wedding Anniversary. They live 70 miles away. He hadn't been to their home in 6 years because of these attacks. Seven months later they were both in the hospital at the same time--my father for a 5-way bypass and my mother for shoulder replacement after falling in a snow and ice storm. Husband couldn't make it 70 miles then either. Seeing both of them in the hospital, neither worrying about themselves, but totally concerned about each other--listening to nurses tell me how "cute" and "beautiful" their love for each other was--I knew then that my husband and I did not have that kind of love and never would--no matter what I had previously done or would try to do to improve things. That was when I finally gave up all hope and began planning my future--my out-there-on-my-own future. It took two more years to leave.    There had been no physical abuse. Just emotional neglect--probably by both of us. Years of unhappiness finally turned into a situation of knowing I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.     The divorce is not yet final and the kids blame me for "destroying their lives," but I am becoming a better and happier person day by day.     If you are seriously contemplating divorce, then it is probably time. Good luck to you.|`|TQW5E6olaa	When I hated coming home and couldn't stand to be around him, we were engaged though, not married. But after 6 years, it sure felt like a divorce...|`|BC2CNH3jaa	I was with a pretty awful guy (Emotionally abusive, controlling, perverted, drugs), and miserable. I made a split decision to go see my sister in another town, and took off. Once I was there, I knew I would never go back to him, no matter the cost.  Once your out of the situation, it's a lot easier to see how negative it is.  These guys isolate you, so you don't think anyone is there for you, but people are.  They also are master brainwashers and manipulators.  I'm so mad at myself for ever getting involved with this looser.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	He threatened suicide and my inner response was "like I need another mess to clean up," but I didn't say it, of course.  He was an alcoholic, we had a baby and I was in law school.  I sent him home to his mom and he's still alive.|`|CM0C65dtaa	There was no set point.  I had been unhappy for about 5 years.  One day I just realized that things were never going to change and I didn't want to spend the rest of my life living like that, so I moved out "temporarily".  After a few months of living on my own, I couldn't make myself WANT to go back.  That was almost 5 years ago.  I am now with another man and am happier than a pig in sh*t.|`|AA10248966	I found out she aborted a baby which was not mine, because she had not had sex with me on her choice for more than a year. AIDS|`|yGwda7wPaa	My husband slapped me in the face and told me that I was worthless.  That did it for me.  But really, it was the last straw.  We had been having problems for 2 years.  I think when you know that you have tried everything humanly possible to save your marriage, and it just still is not working, that is when it is time to divorce.  But, don't walk away without trying.  Good luck.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	I'm still married but I would assume it would involve 1-infidelity, 2-poor money management, or 3-abuse|`|GQUaFGHLaa	I had been told by a counselor that if I did not get a divorce then I would end up being abused for the rest of my life.|`|5jMNBO2naa	easy  when she walked  i filed the very next day|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Let's see. I think I knew it was time when my husband's girlfriend got pregnant, and he asked me if he could move her closer so he could help raise the baby....|`|AcmfbJVpaa	wen you spouse comes from work and you want to disappear or better you wish he disappear|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Order of protection... she wanted me to stop asking why she was leaving...it was because she didn't love me that's why. I get it now but dam I just wanted to know why she left. I never was violent towards her at all. Oh well. Life is better now anyways...sort of.|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	When he cheated, flirted with other woman.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	I have been happily married for 28 years to my second wife and consider it a great gift.     Earlier in life I thought I was happily married until I found out my first wife was cheating on me. I wasn't getting any attention, and found out a neighbor was getting my share. At a later point after the divorce, the neighbor apologized to me and I honestly told him he had inadvertently saved my life.     Looking back, I can't imagine a long life with my first wife. She had childhood issues from her parent's divorce.     Divorce can be painful but it can put you on the road to happiness.|`|RqzIscVHaa	When I confronted him about the skank he had been seeing. I left that day and never looked back (had to wait a year to for a no-fault divorce, as he wouldn't admit to infidelity).|`|kWVSgs4Aaa	Take some time apart first.  Be amazed what that will do for you both. Then if you still feel the same way. Then do what you think is best.
JOQJwcR6aa	i'm the same way you are and i haven't as of yet gotten hurt by a guy i just this way because of the stories i've heard from other women/friends/family members...I have no clue how to stop|`|7519e10677e4f1ca5363e860ade206d0aa	cause when we love a man and give him everything; he just leaves u 4 someone else; u realize u gave up everything for him and now u got nothing|`|E0PZoHMkaa	Time and maturity.  When you have a few years behind you, you'll begin to see things you never imagined.  Your priorities may shift and your expectations will definitely change.  When you stop relying on someone else to make you happy or give you a baby and a house and a car and a social life........you'll begin to understand that men aren't so bad.  We give more when women demand less.
Flgtz6taaa	aww...pull him over after class...catch him off guard and talk about what you've heard and how you feel. If he smiles or agrees it worked!|`|A2u06IS1aa	"accidentally" bump into him and juss make a comment like "oh im sorry.. Hey your that cute guy in my class!" (: it should work. If he likes you he'll blush and his eyes will dilate. And then if he likes you, you should ask him out(; nothing wrong with a girl asking a guy out! (;;|`|NEEVRp16aa	It isn't that bad. You don't have the experience yet.  Instead of getting into trouble in class try using the class to start a conversation outside of the classroom to see what will happen.  Have a little faith and take a chance.  Remember that you can't swim until you get in the water.|`|MV2q89Fiaa	right him a note 4 Valentines day and uhhh  get a box of candy (chocolates) and in the note, or card, right I really like u n' stuff, and I was wondering if u wanna go out with me.

Why open a door which may lead to disaster and you end up pregnant or something. You have plenty of time to date and right now is not the time. Keep this guy respecting you or end up with a bad REP. What would he know about luv?|`|CNu77YPiaa	just approach him after class when he is alone and say hi|`|eLqf0Zl5aa	say things in class that get his attention. when your outside of class, maybe ask him a question or comment on the class. or what a freak your teacher is.

Talk to hima nd say "I know someone who likes you"  and he will say "who?"  and describe youself but dont say your name and then just be like "I gotta go bye" right after you give him your description|`|L1iFt0RWaa	start talking to him, just be like hey whats up.   since he obviously like you, i dont think you should be embarrassed of anything.|`|9l3x4jqvaa	Just after the bell rings get next to him as you are going to your next class then just compliment him like those are cool shoes or tha is  a cool shirt and then just walk away. Hopefully he might say hey wait and maybe he will give you his number.

PDYiwb3Raa	I'm sorry to tell ya this but if he's the kind of guy who wants to know where u are every second... then just be patient and wait it out. If he doesn't stop he really needs you because relationships are like that in the beginning, it's like you always text and talk and stuff. If he waits for you to text then he cares because he wants to know what ur doing . But when he starts having panic attacks about not knowing what ur doing then dump him because he'll never leave u alone.|`|1ZfFSH6maa	i think you already have your answer he needs YOU to need HIM    i hate to admit this but i have personal experience with this with my last boyfriend. i LOVED him sooo much! but i would always have to wait for him to initiate things (texts, calls, what to do on a date etc.) because i needed to know that he needs me. but when i needed someone to help me out, like when i was sad or feeling crappy i knew i could turn to him and i did.    so i think you should get your answer from that. does he tell you whats wrong? does he ask for your help with things?   if yes, than he needs you    :) :) :)|`|tfkHZXYTaa	when i text or call my girl to much i feel like im a boughter to her so i try to give her lots lot of space..but shell always answers all my calls and texts.maybye he dosnt want to make you feel like he owns you..|`|kfg1Sw72aa	Guys don't regularly like talking on the phone, if he actually waits for you to call him then he must really love you, the true answer is only time will tell you how much he really loves you in different situations.    good luck!|`|izDlfkZXaa	Some people just really don't like calling and texting. I don't. Doesn't mean I don't love my girl any less.|`|d4f7a89688a581eea0b65f858f25f2daaa	Is that your picture?   If so, very cute!    How does he act?  Does he open doors for you, bring you flowers, what about valentines day - at least a romantic card, saying he cares!    Little things...  Make him chase you a bit... If you are too easy he may take you for granted...    There is something about a challenge, when she is a little edgy and I am not really sure that makes you try harder.      Does he act jealous?       Watch and listen -- men are bad at hiding their feelings....|`|9T4Nzzcpaa	give him a little space   like if you always call him at a certain  time dont call him and see if he freaks out or doesnt care|`|7ILwgM8Iaa	If he still cuddles with you after sex and can talk to you after he loves you :)|`|EICm5lkIaa	ASK HIM URSELF WHY HES ACTIN THIS STRANGE WAY.

hZEo3SnWaa	Your dad is going through growing pains.  He can't believe his little girl is growing up and gulp, actually has a boyfriend!  My husband was the same way with our oldest daughter.  She has been seeing the same boy for 2 years now, but at first her daddy refused to accept that she had a boyfriend.  The good news is that now my daughter's boyfriend actually comes into the house and my husband will have a nice conversation with him.  Respect your father's wishes and allow him time to get used to the idea.  Everything will be okay.|`|2Ck0OLlDaa	It's like asking 'How is babby formed?' your father doesn't want anything mysterious to happen.... I say mysterious I mean SEX|`|575eOAh7aa	tell yur dad yu already had sex and that there is nothing he can do to stop yu|`|slNm7BZ4aa	Wow, that's kinda stupid.  I'm just guessing being a girl, your dad feels more protective of you and all, and it's hard to learn to let go and realize there's another boy in your life.       Good Luck :]
izQn53q2aa	Well, thank you for helping to lower my IQ score.  There goes med-school for me...*sigh*   ;)|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	agreed.  these kids are supposed to be going to school and they cant even string a coherent sentence together.  the mind boggles.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Some of my brain cells have died by reading those questions (especially the second one).|`|0kVDII2saa	please read the first question under my profile and answer it. i hate my life btw|`|1cBV1V3iaa	no but quesions like thz do ..i understood the last one though|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Yes especially the ones that ask Does he/she really like me or Am I pretty|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Not at all but then you are very young.  I wouldn't complain if I were you.|`|aEbk51zSaa	haha     answerm mine plz????  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Wow, that second one really threw me out for a loop|`|2thQbeAYaa	LOL .   retarddds.|`|tC4HRBW9aa	Ha, ha ha I defidently think that they do make you dumber lol!

wXaGIPSPaa	He knows your buttons and how to push them. He knows how to turn the subject around so its on you and he is off the hot spot.  Have you ever just left when he starts cursing? Get in the car and go do something else.  Good marriages dont just happen. They take alot of work and alot of forgiveness.  You should choose your battles and arguing over dumb stuff is just that dumb!  Make a list of all the good things about this man.  Read it to him and then look him in the eye and tellhim how much you appreciate and love him for these reasons.  Dont bring up the arguing or any complaints etc.  Just leave it at that.  You will be surprised.  Good luck hon.  Its not easy but its worth it.   oh...unless he ever lays a hand on you...thats another story.|`|lhLy0upKaa	tell him: see ya later...bye.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	My husband looves to argue. He's not as bad as he used to be, I think after he slept on the couch enough times he started to learn. Now I kind of look at it like a stupid game he plays, and I laugh at him when he tries to start a fight. I'm like, you are so trying to start an argument! And I'll make fun of him for how he does that, because I think it's so silly! I'll just laugh and laugh and then he will relax. Try that, maybe it will help. I'm sure things will get better soon.|`|DenLZAL1aa	see a counselor|`|sx0PpjvAaa	You sound so lovable and reasonable so it must be all his fault. You are too good for him. Buy him a parrot that he can argue with.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Of course your sick of it.  Who wouldnt be.  I bet he is sick of it as well.  I would venture to guess you guys are quite young.    My next statement would be that this is total immaturity.  you guys are actually fighting about nothing.    I bet after the arguement you both think, what the hell was that about.    Honestly its really just time for the two of you to grow up.  Once you start taking life a little more serious I think you will see a huge difference in both your attitudes.    You can read some great relationship articles at the site below.|`|813e4ae08051a83b82d19022e31f3510aa	First, I say don't plan any children. You do not want to bring children into such a dysfunctional home. You guys need to talk and ask yourselves is this the way you want to spend the rest of life together. Is the marriage worth all the fussing? Why are you still together is there love? What do you enjoy doing together? What is the root of the whole matter, finances, health, drinking or what? If you both feel as if it not finding a solution then walk away.|`|AA11646252	Get him a friend he can talk to and give him advice on this stuff.  Even if it is one of your friends talking to him.  Get them to explain everyone has faults and you need to over look his and him yours to a point so that you do not argue over stupid stuff.  Like the wife leaves my tools and car stuff alone and i leave her piles of stuff on the sink and dressers alone.  It is all about accepting some things about each other.    rd
DRNahon0aa	talk to him...................see if he texts u first....................pay attention for flirtyness!
gsQU85fIaa	sounds like you need someone to confide in my   is 940-765-8955 or you can call your local mhmr crisis line whatever your decision is just remember that there are people that can help I meen it if nothing else call me I went through some of the same things while i was growing up|`|0gy5vuWIaa	it must be hard with all this in your life maybe get yourself friend that you can talk to trust me it makes things much better when my parents got divorced if it werent for my friend i dont know what would of happened. find a get away for yourself something that makes you happy. good luck and the best of health|`|R8fEO8tUaa	mayb u should have a little gettogether with ur friends, with the sole purpose to get sad things off ur minds, so u can just talk about the deaths and other things that worry u..    other than that, just try to keep up in school, and tell ur bf u hope hell get better, or that nothiing serious will occur|`|97eFBAS7aa	I feel like that sometimes maybe u just need to get your feelings out to someone who will listen your family needs to be their for u it's clear that their is a lot of things going on in your life and try therapy or talking to your counselor that helps    EDIT: Also your no where near anorexic sorry if my spellings wrong I know a lot of girls that are 15+16 that have a weight of 100 your at an average weight size don't worry your friend will be okay just keep praying and I'll pray to ^_^|`|OhKERNlsaa	I feel really sorry for you dear. Stress is awful thing and you can't let it get the better of you.     Sometimes we need to just take a few moments to ourselves and sort everything out. Go into your room and instead of just laying there, think about everything.     Cry, scream, kick, do whatever makes you feel better. Just go wild and empty out all your emotions! A journal, I've found, has helped too. A refuge were you can just dump everything out. Or find somebody who's not completely crazy at the moment, like a pen pal or something. Prayer helps  a whole lot.     I'm sure your parents cared and maybe they're stressed and scared too.|`|AFjfkrjcaa	Talk to God.  When I feel a lot of stress it's the only thing that helps.  God will help you through it, if you ask Him.  He cares deeply about you always, even when it feels like no one else does.
eObzadUhaa	she's jealous, hun.  don't listen to her.  she has a boyfriend, but she's mad because you have a lot of options and she's probably insecure because she doesn't think she could get as many guys as you.  if she really feels that way and tries to sabotage you or make you feel bad about it, she's not a very good friend.  just tell her to go hang with her boyfriend and mind her own business.|`|UyAtzJsFaa	She is most likely jealous! Don't listen to her you can talk to all the guys you want too haha. She has a boyfriend you dont. Tell her to get over herself haha|`|TQ7mBjvkaa	Well  i dont koww y she wouldd do thiss if she has a boyfriend  i dont think shes jealous....but then again i dont know her.  maybe you shouldd justt askk her likee y do u care.. but dont be mean about it.  Justt say like " why are you alwayss talking abou them i mean itss like they aree my friends andd if you dont like themm wellll.........thann maybee we cann hangg out when like they arentt around. butt i likee themm.and theyy are MY friends...soo like you dont have to like them"        GODD LUCKK WITH THAT AND HOPE I HELPED =]|`|Gsdb68fUaa	shes jealous!!!!!!!!!! definitely without a doubt   dont let it bother you  you go girl go get emmmm hahaha
DzIqpeu5aa	Yeah. My husbands latest favorite tactic to try to get to me is to tell me he's moving out. He probably won't EVER do it. He's just not brave enough. We have two young children and I don't work. He just  completely overreacts to these fights that we have. All I can say is that he is just such a baby! He had a shitty role model for a father, so he's got a lot going against him. I understand that. But it sure makes it hard to live with him. We go to counseling and when we miss a few weeks, like we have lately, it sure is obvious. I can't wait to get back in there. Our counselor kind of lets hubby know when he's out of line, overreacting, being unfair. He fights unfairly, too. Mean.    Dang, I really never thought marriage would be this much work and cause this much unhappiness at times. You caught me at a bad time, too. It's our anniversary and we haven't spoken all day because, once again, he completely overreacted and lost his temper about something minor. (He freaked out that I deleted American Idol from our DVR before he was finished watching it. Said I did it on purpose. I didn't. It was a mistake. Puh-leeze!).    I bet I've made you feel like you don't have it as bad as you thought! Good luck to you.|`|b6TfBh0zaa	yep, i am...and trying to figure out my future as we speak..|`|b26NgqOFaa	Oh hell yes.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Hon. tell him to grown up, build a bridge & walk over it.    He isn't going to change & if it really bothers you that much then leave him.|`|AA12041870	Not anymore.|`|XmudUg2aaa	YES!     Mine pouts, like an eight year old little boy.     It's quite sad actually.     I wish I could just spank him and be done with it.|`|yGwda7wPaa	I agree.  My ex husband suffers from a classic case of "unforgiveness" I call it.  It will only hurt him in the end.  But, the fact is, if you love him, you have to realize that everyone has a different perspective.  Just because he doesn't see things the way that you do, doesn't mean he is wrong.  He was likely raised differently than you were, and has his own emotional issues to deal with.  I am sure he isn't trying to be difficult.  I would just validate his feelings.  When he is upset, don't dismiss him.  Tell him that you understand.  Be compassionate.  The mountain becomes much smaller when someone is there to understand and listen.  The mountain gets bigger and bigger if you tell him he "shouldn't" feel the way he feels.  Good luck.
7JFUiBoKaa	The economy is definitely the issue here. Some people have lost there jobs. Our schools here do not have a senior class trip. They have other activities.
hwRF1yzHaa	Depending on her personality,    Girls like a guy who will be open with her.    Become her friend first, or get to know one of her friends.    If you start to notice abnormal things, like her walking close by you when     you walk/talk...or being open about it, you'll know.    And depending on your age, how open SHE is.    And how long you have been crushing. If you notice you have and she     hasn't noticed, or said anything...come clean about it.    Girls like guys who will admit they like her straight through.    And (also depending on your age) ask her out. If she doesn't like you,     she doesn't like you. But give it some time.    (Good Luck!)
cl6r8cGBaa	age doesnt matter- an old saying
L0DFU8d2aa	I'm EXACTLY the same way.    Girls are pure DRAMA!    Guys are more laid back and don't like drama.    You like them better because your smart and don't try to fit in , your you and this is the result.|`|agTCqkLDaa	My mom and sister both have more guy friends than girls and I'm starting to get there myself and none of us are easy!    I have one really, really close girlfriend and a couple of girlfriends who I hang out with from time to time, but for the most part: drama, drama, drama...oh and beware, gay men and bisexual men seem to carry the same drama as women thus I've learned.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	i have five sisters and i relate to girls more go figure i interact alot better|`|7ROXROUxaa	guys are much better to hang out with. girls are too b***hy & stab you in the back. there's nothing wrong with having a bunch of guy friends!! maybe you could always become friends with their girlfriends or something|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	is it because you are easy?|`|fsddd1paaa	I have more guy friends than girl friends too. Some people just get along better with people so different (opposite sex) Que sera sera (latin or spanish for what will be, will be)|`|JH8Afnf4aa	Because guys aren't as hormonal and stressed about "personal life," as much as girls.     Same here - I have more guy friends then girls too. It's fine though. ;)|`|joFi5eroaa	Then obviosly you should go get a gender change and change yourself into a guy. then you would be normal|`|OhKERNlsaa	Yeah, us girls can really suck sometimes. It's OK to have a lot of guy friends, they rock! Maybe you don't like all the drama and emotions us girls come with.|`|OcZ0NyqRaa	hehe well just remember that you change as well as you friends, and guys are a lot more open and life is a lot simpler to us. girls talk behind backs and care too much abuot image (well some of them) and it sounds like your not that kind of girl, and thats why guys like you more, cause they can relate to you. you should probably be warry tho, not all guys are nice for no reason. keep in mind you are in college...|`|XZqJ3AHLaa	I agree!  But one problem I have run into is that it is hard to get a BF then.  Most guys do not like it that their GF is hanging around a bunch of single guys.  Same would be if your BF always hung around a bunch of single "shady girls"!  And trust me the guys aren't always all that "nice and innocent" as they seem.  Some may just be trying to get in your pants so watch for that.  So I recommend keeping some GF's and the guy friends are not going to be a problem as long as you aren't looking for a serious relationship.|`|cDue0jdDaa	I too have this issue.  But there is nothing wrong with it.  Girls can be "cliquish" and catty and fickle.  But I have always found it more enjoyable to hang out with guys.  And the main reason is guys will generally tell each other how it is.  So I don't think in my opinion this is a bad thing for you.  If you have a great time hanging out with the guys then by all means do so.|`|ObBcKZuAaa	it seems like girls that are more "down to earth" and don't tend to talk **** or act shady are more likely to hang out with guys because like u said, most chicks are just like that. guys can be dickheads too tho if u give 'em the wrong idea so be careful|`|575eOAh7aa	there not yur friends they just want yur panties.|`|B462BQYzaa	i have more guy friends than girl friends too - you shouldn't let that bother you - you'll eventually find that group of friends (girls) who you will be able to bond easily with - everyone changes as they get older, to them maybe u've changed too but we never realize it ourselves.|`|lWzrLHvTaa	MAN YOU AND I TOTALLY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM OR AT LEAST HAD. I USE TO HAVE SO MANY GIRLFRIENDS AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY TOO BUSY WITH THEMSELVES TO EVEN NOTICE ME......SO WHATEVER. AND NOW I HAVE SO MANY GOOD GUY FRIENDS THAT ARE JUST STRICTLY FRIENDS THE ARE JUST LIKE MY GIRLFRIENDS BUT GUYS !!!!!!!! I CAN TALK TO THEM ABOUT ANYTHING JUST LIKE THEY DO ME!!!!!!!!!! ONE BIG REASON THAT I GOT ALONG WIT GUYS SO GOOD IS CUZ THEY COULD TALK TO ME BOUT THERE GIRLFRIENDS AND PROBLEMS AND I DONT MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT(LIKE MOST GIRLS DO). BUT I WOULD NOT SWEAT IT ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE MORE GUY FRIENDS THAN GIRLS. I STILL HAVE SOME GOOD GIRLFRIENDS. SO DONT WORRY BOUT LOOSING GIRLFRIENDS IT HAPPENS, I KNOW I LOST BOUT ALL MINE.......PPL CHANGE AND YOU CANT STOP THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sr7jX2wYaa	I think  brownies are a good choice & tell them to each bring an egg, I think it is 2 or  3 eggs per mix.  so you will have  all the eggs you need. you provide the veg. oil. Tell them it will be a brownie  bake off with standard box mix, & have 2 teams of 3, & put 3 - team 1ones on a piece of paper & 3 team -2 & you all draw to see who are together on teams, before the party so each of you on teams can plan secret ingredients to bring to  make your brownies better. Every one  likes  brownies , so  that is why I chose them Plus with 2 teams  the brownies can all go in the oven at the same time.

My two best friends though will be at the Valentine's Day dance at school (yeah, the 14th) with their dates. I wasn't asked and knowing it'll just be me dateless made me not want to go anymore..    I wasn't going to let this get to me but yeah it kind of hurts! And it hurts to think and remember of my Valentine's Day last year and how amazing that was...

vupWa0eXaa	Just need to keep telling them that you are an adult now, and its only right for you to haev yoru privacy. And if they dont like, go ahead with the lock thing.    If they have a problem with that, then i suggest  you look for somewhere else to live, either wit a friend or by urself, if you feel you cant live at home anymore.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	when u live under some 1 else's roof, u r under their rules. after all, the house u r in is their house. they mean well & they probably don't want crumbs from food traces laying around. when u have yer own place, u may better understand all the responsibilities u don't really understand right now. when yer on yer own, everything seems 2 come 2 light somehow.|`|zQIatfySaa	You do deserve your privacy but you are in  your parents home.  There is no quick fix other than if you want real privacy get a place of your own.    I respect my childrens privacy, their rooms are  in my house, I rarely go into their  their rooms.  bathrooms are everyones regardless of where they are you need one and one is busy you use another.  Moving will get you the privacy you so want.|`|AA12391059	tell them that you care for them but they have their own space and that it annoys you that their always in yours. it annoys you and it is an invasion of privacy. or when they go in yours try to direct them into the living room to speak to you or just go in their room|`|REfdT8JFaa	I would go buy a new door knob with a key so you can lock your room when you leave and only you will have the key.

It could have been that you did not know the name of the show and you called it that "Mexican show". It could happen to anyone. In the future, do not say "Mexican" say Hispanic.

Hope this helps.|`|ERI4MMfKaa	Some people could take it that way, but if your friends knows that you are not like that then i wouldn't worry about it. It was a simply statement adn nothing more.

VEEgoDkFaa	Your focus should be your boyfriend and not his ex.  You can't control her all you can do is to be a good girlfriend to him so that he wont want to be with her or think about her.  Don't be jealous. That would put him in the middle. Trust him and he'll really appreciate you for it. Don't sweat her, she's not your concern. ';-)|`|29X6EEsKaa	Ask him about it, fighting a little war that nobody acknowledges can't be good. Seriously you need to nip this in the bud.|`|vu3YCN6Jaa	ive had 2 of my boyfriends ex's trying to get back together with him.  You just need to have trust that he is with YOU for a reason and that they didn't work for a reason also!  i found the best thing to do was just not get moody about it and be yourself which is what he should like you for, the ex's in the end just looked like idiots and after some time realise they cant have what you have:)   im still stuck on valentines ideas too....rent a film and make/take out some din dins xx|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Talk to your boyfriend.  Communication is key in every relationship.  Tell him how you are feeling, ask him what he thinks about it and try to come up with a solution.  If he cares about you enough he will be respectful of your feelings and tell his ex that her behavior is innapropriate and he wants her to stop.  If not, you know you need a new boyfriend.    As for the valentines day thing...sorry.  I am having trouble enough thinking of what to get for my bf!!|`|aRDXTWIDaa	Ask him about it. don't beat around the bush. you have to do what you have to do.  Definitely get him something, something personal, but it doesn't have to be expensive.|`|7vt21U1naa	That's really messed up..but anyways talk to your friend and tell him to stay away from her she is his ex girlfriend no need to talk to her..|`|rju0fqVcaa	no u shuld give him anything   answer my Q|`|9N1mDGIJaa	The question is not if she is flirting wit him. it's if he is flirting with her. and you should only get him something if he's getting you something.|`|pORmp0tfaa	I have a similar situation, my boyfriend's ex (who he has been broken up with for YEARS btw) has suddenly decided she wants him back. There's not really anything you can do, just keep being the wonderful girlfriend you are. He wants you and she's just making herself look stupid. Depending how long you guys are dating you might want to do something small for valentines day. Bake him cookies or cupcakes or something|`|kfg1Sw72aa	As long as hes not doing anything back, or giving her or you any sign's that he likes it, its perfectly fine. just tell him you don't like her and think its best that he should stay away from her.  If you feel that he loves you and doesn't like her at all, sure get him something nice.|`|7ILwgM8Iaa	Cuss her out and tell him to stop hanging around her..  and just get him a card or something|`|AjX9VHkeaa	she hatin but its nothin unless ur boyfriend is leading her on or flirting back then my friend u have a problem but a small gift is cool but nothin huge unless u know he got u an gift of equal size
cIuM4BPyaa	girl he likes you alot or he jokes around but really actually means whether he says it or not he just doing it in a playful way to show it sound just like a boy i know he do the same thing to my bestfriend its like he cant live with out her he always talking to her and she says dnt tlk to me and he still do and then when they by theyselves he be like you my boo etc and stuff like that but yeah he likes you secretly hell tell you eventually but dnt wear about it its cutee. lol but also sometimes you can read to much into stuff like my friend did with this boy he always messed with her and stuff but he really deep down didnt like her like that and thought she was ugly and disgusting|`|6db9945ff407961b87dcdc1c2327d1dbaa	ohh.. hmm.. do you only like him as a friend? or do you like him more than that?    If you don't really like him that much, then just avoid.. or tell him in a jokingly way that he's not your type or something like that.  He needs to know because perhaps he's thinking differently and assumes you love him too.|`|uSQxUHQHaa	write him a note askin if he likes u and give it 2 him secretly|`|0b2WSgpfaa	He soooo likes u!|`|kwF5ItCSaa	He's totally in love with you!!!!!|`|Prq0QuLfaa	mmmm he might like you|`|67Lq655yaa	well just talk to him and tell him that you only like him as a friend and that maybe some day you will be bf and gf but don't count on it and do not be mean about it.|`|lqEyvBhbaa	he likes youu ! lol its prettyy obviousu. but you couldd try talkinqq to him about it andd tell him that youu dont like him like that|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	HE LIKES YA GIRLY ;; :)  AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY HOW CUTE!

I'd just ask him how he feels and if he says he has feelings for you and you dont feel the same way just tell him your just interested in being friends nothing more and nothing less. Unless you do like him then try goin out.|`|KMifRaL7aa	just say you think were better of as friends.  he will get it after a while.  thats what my friend said to me.and i had no clue what to say.  but if you only see a guy as a friend. then just tell him that.|`|GqlLcRWtaa	is he gay??? tell the teacher or something just because i am a girl does not mean i cant help...|`|N2RUBUEjaa	It seems as if you guys have gotten close to the point he's fallen for you, or he could be just flirting, nothing more.    When friends get close and comfortable to the point they hang out a lot, they tend to say things like "I love you", especially if it's at a friend's house and they're with someone.    If you really don't like the awkwardness he gives you when doing/saying these things, tell him straight up that you prefer him not to do it, and he will stop. If you want him to stay as just friends, remind him that in a soft way so he doens't take it offensively.|`|VAavSoE3aa	he likes you.    get over it little child.|`|NIiWicdsaa	my little sunflower......wow he OBVIOUSLY LIKES YOU just ignore the whole black vs white thingy if he likes you enough to make a fool of himself all the time he just might actually love you!!!!! :)|`|2Ug3CU1Saa	[Guy's Perspective]  He definately likes you, but he seems really clingy... the rest is up to you!

REfdT8JFaa	the only thing you can really do is ask her why you aren't able to. If everyone else your age is doing this then explain to her that Your embarrassed because you feel your the only one that hasn't started shaving their legs yet. But i will be honest with you it sucks shaving your legs sometimes i wish women were like guys and didn't have to.
AuthyG9Qaa	As a very touchy feely guy who loves hugs I would 100% say that you should start by giving your bf friendly  type hugs BUT hang on a bit longer like maybe for 30 seconds.    Squeeze him too, run fingers through his hair.|`|GJ9xgrx7aa	take your time. i know you probably dont want to hear that but if it's meant to be, it'll be. |`|CrmVyfQEaa	the best way to handle your situation is to be honest with him. Tell him he makes you nervous, but in a good way. Let him know you have never had a boyfriend who was as affectionate as he is and you enjoy it, but for some reason you react in a way you wish you didn't. Let him know you really care, and hopefully if he cares about you the same way he will understand and who knows maybe one day you will be so comfortable with him the nervousness will go away. good luck!
vnJG8UYJaa	Sounds like this guy has a huge problem with self-confidence and self-esteem.  Your gf really should have left the situation alone and let time work things out.    If you want to get to know him better, why don't you see if you can work out a group thing after your class?  Maybe everyone could get together for a pizza to celebrate someone earning something.  (I know nothing about Tae Kwon Do)  He would probably be a lot more comfortable in a group situation.    Just a word of caution.  In order for you to have a successful relationship, even as a friend, this guy needs to become more confident.  He has to do that, you cannot do it for him.  Do not get caught into the trap of, "If only he could understand that I really care about him."      If you get a chance to know him, encourage him to continue in these classes.  These kinds of things are usually great for building confidence.    Good luck and have fun!|`|rCLULlhIaa	get a big group of frineds (his and yours) and go to the mall/ movies and chill. u may see how much fun u hav and how wellu 2 work or u may see ur not a perfect match. get to know him more... start talking! play like u feel ur not good enough for him and u may feel balanced in a future relationship.|`|Zb0deAf4aa	Why don't you try and asking him out?|`|scoXsijqaa	say "i heard that my friend talked to you" look him in the eye and then look down. when he starts talking to you again look at him and tell him that he is not too good for you.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Um, your friends need your permission to talk to people?    Best thing to do is, after class, say "whoo, that was a workout!  I'm dying for a cold drink. Could I talk you into joining me?  I'd love some company."  No pressure, it's not a date, and you two would get a chance to get to know each other a bit better.
pMsMx817aa	im just going to be brutally honest, so please don't take any offence to what i say :) i don't mean to sound rude, im a blunt person    you can feel concerned for her, but to a certain point  you can tell her what you think once and then you have to let her choose for herself.  she's over 18 [assuming atleast] so she can make her own decisions and needs to.  its a horrible situation she is in but she's a big girl and she has to do what she believes is right for her and her child.      other than telling her once, all you can do is be there for her no matter what    good luck  ella|`|zmqN0M86aa	You have every right to feel concerned.  You can't help how you feel, especially if it's about a close family member.  You can even talk to her about it.  But the question you need to ask yourself is will she listen?

JAdNkzENaa	save the date cards usually get sent out like a year in advance. wedding invitations generally get sent out 2-3 months in advance...|`|pMsMx817aa	well  an invitation is the formal invitation  a save the date, just is self explanatory just says the date of the wedding but not giving much more detail than that  save the dates are usually sent out 4-6 months before the wedding and invititations are sent out atleast 6 weeks prior to the wedding    on the save the date it should say formal invitation to follow :)    ella    edit -- everyones going to give you different answers on when they should be sent out    however it doesnt matter as long as the formal invitations are sent out atleast 6 weeks prior to the wedding and the save the dates should be sent out atleast 2-3 months before the formal invitations.  those are at the very least, giving people the opportunity to get off work time get accomodations if needed and money to travel if needed etc etc|`|8ygky5g4aa	A save the date card is sent to all who are to be invited to the wedding about a year before the event, basically telling people to save the date.  Then the formal invitations are sent 6-8 weeks prior to the event.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	A save the date card is a card that is sent out when the wedding date is set, usually 9-12 months in advance of the wedding. It is a courtesy to the invited guests and is usually sent when a wedding is held on a holiday, busy weekend, or during the summer when people are vacationing or the kids are out of school so guests can make arrangements is need be.    It has just a little information, usually the date of the wedding and the location. It's also send out if the wedding will be a destination wedding and guests will have to travel a long way or is out of the country (let's people know well in advance if they need to plan their budget, make sitter/pet arrangements, get passports up to date, etc...).     Wedding invitations are sent out at least six weeks in advance of the wedding and contain more detailed information such as reception site, registry list(s), directions, and hotel info.     Best wishes!|`|cGbTJobeaa	For my jaded opinion....save the date cards are a waste of money and something that the wedding industry tries to convince stressed out, cash-strapped brides that they absolutely positively need.    IMHO, you really only need to send out save the date type cards if you're having something like a destination wedding or a lot of out of town guests.  I would only send them a save the date card about 3 months in advance so they can make their travel arrangements.  Think about it...how many out of town guests would you actually be inviting?  And of those people...that would actually spend close to a thousand dollars in travel costs to attend your wedding, aren't you, your fiance or your respective parents in close enough contact with them that they're already well aware that they'll be invited to your wedding and the basic timeframe of your wedding.    Honestly...as important as the wedding is to the bride, what would you do with a piece of mail for an event 9 - 12 months in advance?  Think "oh that's interesting, we're going to be invited to Margie's wedding" and then put that piece of mail in your circular file.  Except for maybe one or two people, that magnet or postcard is not going to be put on anyone's refrigerator.    You're going to spend how much money on the cards and postage for the possibly one or two local couples who would actually a) mark the date on their calendar; b) happen to be planning a vacation around the time of your wedding; c) consult their calendar to see if they have any social obligations; and d) decide to postpone their vacation to the Poconos so they can attend your wedding.    Even if you did send a save the date card and they have another event come up, they are going to decide which event is more important for them to attend. They are not going to say "gee, I would like to go to my sister's wedding, but Margie sent me a save the date card first, so I have to go to Margie's wedding."    Honestly...the people who are close enough to you that they would actually arrange their vacation plans around the timing of your wedding are going to know approximately when you are getting married and they will call you.    Even the out of town guests, they're going to be in close enough contact with you, your fiance or the parents that they'll call and ask "what date is Margie's wedding again?"  We had slightly more than dozen family members and friends fly in for our wedding....which represented 6 sets of couples.  Either me, my fiance or our parents were in e-mail and phone contact them anyway, so they didn't need a mass-produced save the date card. When they were checking out fares, they called whichever family member they talk to most often and asked.  And they didn't mark that date in their calendar. Nope, the next time they were on travelocity, they would call and ask the date again.  So, sending a save the date card wouldn't have made it to their calendar regardless.     BTW, if you are having a ton of out of town guests, you should contact a hotel and get a group rate.      Now the invitation...that's something else.  Those are necessary.  When people receive the invitation 6 weeks before the wedding, THAT'S when they actually mark their calendar and send in their RSVP.    If they have another obligation for that date, they will decide which one is more important.  In my world, weddings usually take precedence over something like a dental visit. I can call my dentist and reschedule.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	Save the dates are not formal and they don't contain as much information as the wedding invitation. They are typically sent out 8-12 months before the wedding. Their purpose is to let your guests know enough about your wedding so that they can make travel and acommodation arrangements. They may say something like:    "Please save the date for the wedding of Jane Doe and John Smith on Sunday October 11, 2009 in Chicago Illinois. Formal Invitations to Follow."     Your invitation will contain the location and time of the ceremony along with an RSVP card. They are typically sent out 8-10 weeks before the ceremony. They may say something like:    "Mr. and Mrs. John Doe request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their daughter Jane Doe to John Smith Sunday October 11, 2009 two thousand and nine at half after four o' clock First Baptist Church Briarcliff Manor."     Hope that helps!

kqa9VFrfaa	Marriage is the hardest thing U will ever attempt. Most young marriages do not have good odds simply because people tend to change, and when U R young U have a lot of changing to do.   So use all  the advice U can if U want to stay together. If U guys got married for all the "right" reasons, and not for superficial reasons, then you have as good as chance as anybody to succeed.  Do yourselves a favor and read some good books on marriage. It will help U & can't hurt your chances. If U can always remember to be polite to each other, no matter how angry U get at times, that will go a long way to keeping U together.   Being polite and respectful is just as important as sex or having enough money. The smartest people of all are polite even to their enemies. So I hope this helps U. You can always try to beat the odds, and stay in love.|`|eqWftUQeaa	Oh wow... you guys have been married for 5 months and already having problems? you guys are ssssoooo young!

aDL7xmt6aa	Stop turning your blessings into curses like a whiny Hebrew wandering in the desert and blaming God for the answers to your prayers just because you don't appreciate His sense of humor.  Your vows must stand as if they were spoken by other than an empty husk of a shallow human being.  The keys to your chains are at the foot of the cross,  the only place you'll find forgiveness.  If you want to be free, lay it all there and let Him do what He does best.|`|b26NgqOFaa	Well you are probably entitled to some of these feelings. Most of us married couples will probably notice their partner changing as the years pass- what keeps us attractive in the other's eyes is the love and respect that we are supposed to have for each other.  But you can't always stay in love or respect someone when they are never around.  So I would say one of these problems would need to be addressed but probably the most tactful would be to work on how much time you spend together, because weight is a touchy subject.|`|DenLZAL1aa	You took vows, "through sickness and health", maybe you recall this?

Think about it, if one of you were paralyzed, would you still love him?  Would you still try to be intimate?  I would think yes.  So, him adding a few extra pounds should be something you can work through.  If it was you, and you were pregnant and gained weight, you would want him to understand.  Think of some ideas to kick up your sex life a notch.  I am not sure what you are into, but if you are creative, I think you could come up with some really good ideas.  But, I would try to spend some quality time with him first.  That is something that you mentioned is lacking.  How about setting up a date?  You could meet him at a restaurant, just like you are on a first date.  Do something romantic.  Take a weekend trip to a bed and breakfast.  There is more to a book than its cover.|`|M5XE0ycCaa	Yes you are a jerk.    At least you still love him.  there is hope after all.  We all know being just short of obese is a crock.  My buddies Dr told him that he was obese.  He is in great shape but the muscle fat is included.    there was obviously something that once attracted you to him physically.  Try and draw from that again.  Plan some romatic things and go from there.    You may even need to see a counsellor or something.    One other thing.  if he is out of shape why not be honest with him.  My wife and I have both agreed that if anything like that happens we want to know about it.    I really think things will be fine.

(Just Kidding, good luck)|`|dM8EyL6caa	Talk to him about it. Men are not mind readers. I understand you are in love but I believe there has to be a physical attraction for intimacy. Cook healthy meals pack his lunch. Workout together, it's a great way to improve the physical and health aspect of his life, as well as a great time for you all to spend time together leading to improving your relationship. Don't give up on him. True love is too hard to find.Good Luck!|`|LVC8BTtLaa	you should try to courage hime to lose some weight and if u cant face doing that you should say your going on a diet and that it would really help if he did the same and worked out with you. Buy healthy foods and throw out unhealthy junk food|`|Svylyww3aa	The question you should be asking is to yourself ....Do you really love him? Looks are in the eyes of the beholder.....I know that if the love of my life allows himself to get physically abandon I would question his feeling for me.... he has no motivation for staying fit....do he not want to spend the rest of his life with you? maybe hes not attracted to you as well.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	It does matter whether you're physically attracted to him. I assume that since you got married, you once were. Don't tell him you're not attracted to him but tell him instead that you feel that he needs to spend more quality time with you since the lack of it is affecting the relationship. After that, ask him to join the gym or exercise with you. One step at a time.|`|XmudUg2aaa	Men feel that it's okay to not feel attracted to their wives if they gain weight....so why should it be different for us?    I'd have a calm heart to heart with him and come up with some ways to get you both in shape.    My husband is starting to gain a little weight and I know I'm mean but I can't be really nice about it.     He told me if I started to let myself go (when we first starting dating) that he would buy me a gym membership and let me know.     Well I will love him when he is old and gray....but while he is young and can be hot....he needs to be hot.     I didn't marry a larger man....I married a trim fit runner. So it would be false advertisement if he changes in five years because he wont work out or eat the right foods. I could see if he got sick or injured.....but just plain laziness...or too busy to eat right...not flying!|`|6afa558f5f7db4c42e087d9a9cac01b7aa	be  greatful  that  you  have  a  man  that  loves  you and  stop  whining.    if  you  have  issues  with  his  weight  then  start  cooking  good  .low  fat  food  and  encourage  him  to loose  just  enough..    there  is  nothing  like  team  work  and  in  this  way  you  will  spend  more  time  with  him and  do  more  things  together.|`|X3GjiecGaa	well as love is a key factor in being ith someone but psysicall is also important in a remlationshitp wearther anyone wgrees with me orr not. And simple because when you arent sexually attracted to your mate then that gves you the urgers to venture out and seek elsewher because your not happy in that department.    maybe you should talk to him about dropping some lbs and go to a gym and do work out plans togehter. or if your the one who cooks maybe cook more healthier meals|`|EICm5lkIaa	HEYY LISTEN LADY IM JUST A TEENAGER, BUT I'LL TELL U ONE THING. I GIVE PRETTY DAMN GOOD ADVISE. AND I HAVE THE PERFECT REQUEST FOR YOU. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP U WANT COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR PARTNER. IF YOU TRUSTED EACH OTHER YOU WOULD TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL IN THE NICEST WAY POSSIBLE. SOMETIMES THE TRUTH IS PAINFUL. BUT, THATS THE WAY THINGS ARE, AND ITS BETTER THAN NOT KNOWING HOW PPL FEEL ABOUT YOU. GO STRAIGHT OUT AND TELL HIM THAT IT WOULD BE BBETTER FORHIS HEALTH AND FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP IF HE GOT IN A DIET AND STARTED WORKING OUT. I HOPE I HELPED AND GOOD LUCK. TELL HIM HOW U FEEL =D ITS NOT UR FAULT U FEEL THAT WAY. ITS NATURAL HE DOESNT HAVE PHYSICAL ATTRACTION TO U.
4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	The same way you get over any relationship. There is a tried-and-true method!    1. Avoid the ex at all costs. Don't call them. Don't answer their emails. Don't text. Don't hang out where they usually hang out. Don't even look at their picture. CUT THEM OUT until you are completely over them.    2. Keep busy! Hang out with friends. Join a club. Go to a movie. Read a lot of books. Do some volunteer work. Take a class. Work. And get a lot of exercise! Whatever it takes to keep yourself occupied. Do NOT sit around and mope over this for more than a day.    3. Wait. It just takes some time. But you can do it! Millions and millions have been there and done it, too.     Good luck!|`|9xhkOuuBaa	I'm so sorry hun. Would asking him to leave be an option? Would that be better or worse for you? Exercise helps. Even if it's just a quick walk.
yGwda7wPaa	I don't see there being a problem with too much involvement.  The way I see it, there is never too much love for a child.  A child needs all the love that can be provided.  As long as there is nothing abusive going on, I say more involvement is good.|`|HCWkdk4naa	the biological parents should spend as much time with their biological children as possible.  often, this means interactions with exes and new wives.  i'm not sure if you are the ex or the step parent, but you should keep in mind that the most important thing is for the bio-dad to spend time with his kids.  as long as that is being met and there is no abuse, you will just have to put up with awkwardness.  what did you expect getting divorced/getting involved with a divorced guy?|`|pRZ0YviYaa	Nothing is ever too much, grow up, you're all these children's parents now, some of you are birth parents and some of you are step parents, but you're all PARENTS.  You should be interacting as much as it takes to raise these kids right.  Shame on you for even asking this.|`|SheAGLG5aa	That is a great question.I know exactly how you feel and so do a lot of people.It is a tough thing.I think to much involvement would be them going out,talking all the time,and so on.They need to get along for the kids but not be alone.You should be invited to all functions.Just think though they are ex's for a reason though.Although some ex's still mess around to.You just have to trust and not get jealous,its very tough.|`|G5CZYfCjaa	well i have the  answer  mine  hates    to be around   my  ex   so i love   him dearly  but  its just not  that   easy  for a step parent  to realize  you have  siblings
OhKERNlsaa	If these people were your "friends" they could care less if you went to prom or not. Though I do see were your feelings are coming from, because I myself refuse to waste my time at dances.     You could always play sick or say you just don't feel like it. Just don't bring up the subject much.|`|MJhGi8Wuaa	hey please think in another way just try to go to your prom and have fun.think about anything positive in it|`|c5anDswjaa	Just say its not your thing, and you dont have anyone to go with anyways.. They may invite you to go with them! I am not a dancing sort of person either, I just went because it was fun to be dressed up and see everyone looking nice.. And the food, free food is good|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	You can't afford the dress should be a good enough excuse.|`|PkiHXdSBaa	just say you got leprosy|`|eAMMGE84aa	Hmmm... maybe you could say your parents are making you go to this family thing or they are making you go to a play.|`|fsddd1paaa	Fake sick, fake an injury-or even better-tell ur friends you'll go-then call them  on that afternoon and say ur boss called-you have to work that night. Ur already close to being fired, you can't afford to lose this job. Good luck. :)|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	you get in trouble the day before the dance....you get "grounded"|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	You have some time before prom, so I wouldn't say you definitely aren't going just yet. You never know, you may find a great date and have an awesome time... without having to dance! I am not the kind of girl that likes to dress up and never went to any other dance, but I refused to miss my senior prom. I couldn't take my boyfriend for numerous reasons, so I took a friend that I worked with. It was great because I didn't have to worry about sticking together the entire night and I got to enjoy time with my friends. If you really don't want to go, just tell them up front that you have no desire to attend. You could always enjoy the after parties!
8ilHQMq5aa	um because he doesnt want to get arrested for having a bunch of young girls in his place causing trouble. especially if you are drinking.  you girls are a liability.  he probably doesnt want your friend to do anything awkward and turn it around on him  hes not being lame. he is being responsible.   get a clue. you are being immature|`|nUaMheI3aa	Those are under aged teen that you want to bring to his house.. Are you a weirdo. If anything happens to them why they are at his crib he will be responsible..|`|TR5ntsavaa	If he pays the rent, it's his decision. When you get your own place, you can do whatever you want, too.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	mayb he doesnt wnat his apartment wrecked, or he has private things  i guess thats understandable  and if ur bro is a *dick* for not letting u do that, then appaarently so r all ur parents|`|HunSyQaSaa	Lame? no ---- Smart,yes.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	because he is a grown up acting like a grown up and you are a child acting like a child!!!!!!!!!!!!  his home is not your party place. he could get into serious trouble if he did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|o1yy6KABaa	hes being whats callled "grown up"|`|JX82ysInaa	Lol, let me guess you think these answers are lame don't cha?    You're brother is mature, and you, you're just 16 ... lol I'm 13 and I think that you have a cool brother that is a good role model, try acting like him. :)    Ha ha, I bet you hate my answer.  Oh well.|`|f8CN2qIvaa	No--you're being immature.  Your brother is being smart. Besides, it's his place, and he doesn't want or need a crowd of underage people at his apartment.  If anything happened (i.e. drugs, drinking, fights, you name it), HE would get into a lot of trouble over it.  The fact that your friend has a crush on your brother is the last thing on his mind.
FGR7j3Q8aa	I did this for Months with an ex. it always seemed i was fine to hang with when he wanted, his days his time. Then he would still keep the door open for others. messed up, he knew i was trying to get him back. I finally said, are we getting back or not he said NO, so i said, sorry, i don't have time for you. and opened the door. hand him a card for his Birthday and left the two presents there. I would say, hey, i said 4pm your picked time after we planed then i actually have someone or something to do too. don't let it be when he wants he said, fine 4pm then its 4. he has other plans, hey that not COOL. why not dinner with you. hell no, say sorry i made plans at noon.|`|ZhvyzU6saa	no dont cancel it jus hang out wit him|`|edycn5ggaa	Well you asked him in the first place so don't expect him not to already think you're easy to hang out with lol...    Chess would be a pretty lame date so I think you two are just hanging out... Good thing you two got off on a good note!|`|ul1P1qAQaa	Look... if the goal is to show him how much you don't need him then find reasons to feel confident without masquerading around pretending to be find without him when you obviously need his approval or you wouldn't be doing this. You're motive is to feel good, but you can't be independent and confident and okay without him if it takes making him want you to do it... as soon as he realizes it was all smoke and mirrors you'll be right back where you were...    You did it by yourself in the past, do it again. Then if you still want to see how he's doing in the end, plan a game of chess.|`|AA10495394	well if you can make it at 12 then go, if not then just tell him that since he is having friends over to do it another time.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	maybe you still wanna know because you are not over him! go ahead and change the time to noon then you can pick his brain and find out what he is really up to|`|811sLIoEaa	you asked him, you need to be flexible,|`|7vt21U1naa	Just hang out with him and you don't need to play chess you guys can watch a movie or something =]|`|0Biyu60oaa	lmao why would u ask him to play CHESS (lmao) in the first place? and so that just made u easy to hang out with lol cuz u were the one that approached him cuz he probly wasnt even going to hang out with u agn so yes cancel it and tell him u cant make it. pansy...|`|0375db76ea840c1a437eb6fc4bf516d7aa	nope don't cancel it  it doesn't really matter if he pinked another time, u're thinking too much  maybe u still have feelings for him? if u think he's going on a date|`|TQzDd2zCaa	Just hang out with him, don't go jumping to conclusions about what he is really doing.|`|KRDEbZmIaa	LOL :D    just act like ur his friend D:    and three things    -pray to the god (if ya believe in one e_o)  -be cool n go with the flow  -close ur eyes and GO FOR IT :D|`|P5ZNPyW4aa	If you don't want to look to easy to hang out with, but you also want to play chess, cancel this Saturday and ask him if he could do it on another weekend.|`|8b223213bf4fad7bd69b5aba849b7174aa	Don't cancel it!!|`|7ILwgM8Iaa	You think to much.. You shouldn't be hanging out with your ex that breeds trouble.. but if you're going to don't cancel.. If he was seeing a date he'd tell you to make you jellos  Relax.. don't take life to serious consider smoking some weed.
BObu4i9saa	we're making cd's - it's gonna end up costing less than $1 a person (we got some good black friday deals on the cd's and the cases - and the labels were on sale too)  we're also making a couple different ones - each for a different group of people - so the music on it is something that person will most likely enjoy & they should get some use out of them  a friend of mine got some of the personalized m&m's - and added in some that just matched in color without the names on them - they weren't too much money and everone loved them|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	yep i have to agree with you. wasting seventy-five cents and saying it makes the guest feel special is a huge waste of money. even five bucks is a waste....i'd much rather see the bride/groom make a donation to charity in honor of their wedding instead of seeing favors sitting on the reception table after the guests have left, or seeing them tossed in the garbage can on the way out.  i'm more impressed with the couple who make a donation to charity or just don't bother wasting it on coasters,cookies,shot glasses,votives,c.d.s, chocolates,fans,photo albums,blah blah blah.  so if you don't want to do a charity donation, then by all means put towards something extra on your honeymoon or something for your new home! good luck and happy wedding!|`|7upShB9Yaa	Our wedding favors are a little unique. We are having a photo booth at our wedding that spits out 2 sets of 4 pictures. At the top of each set it will have our name and date and a saying at the bottom (not sure what I'm going to put yet). One set of 4 is for the guest to keep. The other set of 4 pictures gets cut up however the guest wants to do it and glued to a scrapbook page where they can put stickers and write things.   It serves as a guest book scrap book as well as wedding favors. The cool thing about it being a wedding favor is they get pictures of themselves verse pictures of the bride and groom. They can always cut the top and bottom off if they don't want all that writing.|`|JAdNkzENaa	it doesnt have to be 5.00 a person - we are giving out 2 chocolate covered cookies in a little tule bag. it will be about .75 a person. i think its totally worth it so our guests fill special =)|`|7CKipTZOaa	Our favors are costing under a dollar each, and we are making a donation to a charity that has special meaning for us HOWEVER I think if you want to put it to the bar budget than that is great and guests will appreciate it|`|y6gVmhHxaa	We did matchbooks with our names and wedding date because that was something special for me.  I have a collection of wedding matchbooks that my Grandmother started and they have dates ranging back to the 50's.  We also had assigned seating so the place cards were silver chairs that we filled with black and white M&Ms.  I don't think it was a waste, I wanted to give a small token to show my appreciation for them being there.  If they didn't want it they didn't have to take it.  If you don't want a coaster from someone elses wedding don't take it, but at least they wanted to give you a little thank you.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I made wine glass charms as the wedding favor.  For members of the wedding party, the charm was unique to that person's interests or personality.  For everyone else, it was a pewter charm that either said "love" or had a heart shape.  Other than the charms for the wedding party and immediate family, I think the wine glass charms cost a whopping $0.50 to make with supplies I bought at Hobby Lobby. It probably took me a whole hour (if that) to assemble one evening.    We wound up doing the wine glass charms because I wanted a Cinderella wine glass charm instead of the Cinderella/Prince Charming champagne glasses.  In looking for a wine glass charm for my husband, I found some cute ones that really reminded me of the best man and MOH.  I happened to mention it to one of my other bridesmaids and she asked what charm I was getting for her. And the idea took off from there.     We did have a bunch of guests staying at the hotel since we got married in a resort town at least 90 minutes away from where most of our guests live.  Our wedding took up about half of the rooms there.  For the guests that were staying at the hotel, I had a gift bag filled with candies, chips and bottled water. The morning after the wedding, we had cookies with our initials and wedding date in the breakfast room at the hotel.  The cookies were available to all of the hotel guests. The cookies cost about $1 each.|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	you can get little candles and do them up nicely|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Those type of favors always seemed so cheesy to me anyway. Take a look at some magazines and it will give you lots of ideas for things you can even do yourself. Favors don't have to be expensive and nobody ever keeps those dated items and rice filled bags anyway. To me those are a waste of money. I am actually doing a candy station with different candies. I am having a beach wedding so I went on ebay and found these awesome fans that match my colors and got 125 of them for like $40 and they are little cheapo ones. I am also doing cupcakes and getting these things called cupcake cuddlers. They are so pretty and I bet at least half the people take one with them after they eat the cupcake. I also went to the dollar tree and got these really cute wallet sized  picture frames and I am going to put one on each table with our picture. sometimes you can find good deals at that place on things that don't look tacky. Well, good luck and I hope I was helpful!|`|F7O0nLK1aa	we are using personalized glass votives for our st patricks day wedding. they will have our name and date with some shamrocks on them. hopefully they will use them to decorate for future holidays. they are under a dollar each.|`|AZCWlGjsaa	No we're not giving any favors.  dont have a HUGE budget to work with..plus most of the favors get left behind anyway.|`|aLJdfbd3aa	I say skip it. Who really wants their wedding favor, anyway? Money towards making the reception more fun is much better sent. We're getting married in September, and no intention of buying silly favors.

nC6qEW1Paa	The concept of having some space isn't a sign of him not loving you. If he needs space then he needs it, and if you pressure him at all or refuse to give it to him he'll take it. The fact that you don't think it makes sense doesn't mean that it doesn't, you need to let go of your perceptions of it and respect his perception. It's common under those circumstances to need a little time to yourself to figure things out and put them into perspective, and he needs you to support him on it by letting him have it. By pushing him and basically nagging him about it you're showing him that you won't respect his views when they don't match your own.     He's not answering your calls because you won't let him breathe and that's what he needs right now. If you would have just told him "Ok baby, take your time and I'll be here when you want to talk" and just offered support he would have come around fast. He needs to know that no matter what it is he needs or wants that you'll be able to support him on it, even if it's not something you agree with(to a reasonable extent). The problem with his family isn't an excuse to argue, it's an opportunity to work together and solve the issue. Most break ups come from a lack of understanding and compromise, you need to understand where he's coming from if you don't agree with it.     Basically you pushed him about it too much, and no one(especially men) likes that. The more you try and grasp at him the farther he'll get, and at some point he'll be completely out of reach. When you do get to talk to him just ask him what it is he needs from you so you guys can be ok, and do your best to do it.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	He's doing what he thinks is right, whatever the reason.    You have no say in this matter.  Love must be mutual or it just won't work.  Be glad you found out this early, rather than after you have had a couple of children and a complicated life.    Move on and find who you were really meant for.  He's out there, and when you find him, all this will quickly become a memory.|`|sYEf626Aaa	Sorry but I think you two are done. I know it`s hard to realize  now but it is better that it happened now then after you are  married.  a guy wouldn`t leave you hanging that long if he still  wanted to be with you. He just does not want to say it|`|7cjqT33Baa	I am not a guy, but I've been married to one for a long time so I'm going to answer this.  There have been times I wanted space.  I just needed time to clear my head.  That he asked you for that and you continued to call, text etc. says a lot.  That would annoy me and it's entirely too needy.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	This guy is chicken s***. He did you a favor. Move on.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Your are scaring him away. Give him his space to think. Don't try to come between him and his family. That is totally up to him. I say give him a certain amount of time to clear his head up, if he doesn't come back, move on.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	I think you are failing to grasp the concept of space. It means a break from one another, that includes communication. A marriage is comprised of many things and one of them is compromise. You are asking a lot from him, expecting him to pack up and move to be near you. What are you willing to do? Basically, you are asking him to choose between you and his family. That is a difficult decision; one you need to respect. He obviously needs time to sort through things. You need to give him this time. He will be in touch once he has had an opportunity to make a sound decision. In the meantime, I think you need to evaluate your role in the relationship and see how you both can meet one another half-way.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Long distance relationship??  Fought a lot??    Doesn't sound like it was a very good relationship to me.  Especially if you think he's a momma's boy.  If you do get back with him, make sure he matures into a man before marrying him.|`|RnJwKF97aa	this is an easy one, as a guy who knows guys...... you are done with him.  I am going to assume you guys are young (early 20's) so dont even worry about it.  Plenty of fish in the sea.  Be patient, the more you want him the further away you will push him.|`|6004c09a1497ae22f6d3fe8cff3c4060aa	Maybe you should look for a guy that loves you more than you love him.  I lost a girl many years ago, by being too possessive.  I smothered her with affection, and she left me.  On reflection, I was so stupid to smother her, and should have given her much more freedom, but when you are young, you tend to be a little selfish, and don't even realize it.  Your best chance to get him back is to let him go !  He may eventually realize what you meant to him, and come back.  If not, time will heal, slowly but surely. You WILL meet another guy, I will guarantee it.  take care sweety.
kWVSgs4Aaa	It is a loved ones responsibility to meet each others needs.  What ever they may be.  This topic, I am sure is the number one reason for cheating.  If they don't get it from their lover.  They will get it somewhere|`|fSSE9cnLaa	I have a higher sex drive but it doesn't control the way I feel about him and our relationship. When it happens it happens... sex is a plus to a relationship but I care more about him satisfying my emotional and mental needs rather than my physical. And he does a great job of that.|`|6752e7ea71d70ccaadc56357b75ffb12aa	just give him what he want and the peace will be around.|`|LtX0lAUIaa	A man with a lower sex drive than his wife should learn to use his tongue and fingers when she wants it and he is not in the mood.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	So...I can either put out when I don't want to or he'll turn to porn?  What a choice. Think I'll pass on that man altogether. Interesting how I've never turned to porn when I'm in the mood and he's not available.  Guess it's called self control.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	A male's drive is constant and unending.  Testosterone is produced by his body and sex drives are chemical in nature to a man.  Remove his testicles and his sex drive disappears, completely.  Most women don't seem to understand this.    A woman's sex drive is only part hormonal, and takes place primarily in her mind.  Thus, it is not as intense as a males.    Seldom do two individuals have the same sexual needs.  Especially when you have two to three children, and a household of things to do.  Guys don't seem to understand this.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	give them sex! keeps everyone from straying|`|fzIeGPZYaa	ok i had the opposite problem, i wanted it more than my ex did. and if he didnt want to do anything i just dealt with it plain and simple. it sucked but i dealt with it, it is possible|`|oxmkllnWaa	sometimes you get along to get along.    it's far far better to keep your spouse sexually satisfied than to deny them and force them to seek satisfaction elsewhere.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think balance and perspective are important.  If my wife's sex drive were higher than mine, I would prefer it if she gave me a choice, and I don't mean on a one-time basis, but on an ongoing basis.  What I mean is that I would want her to occasionally ask me if I want to have sex with her.  Some of the time, I would want to help her out, because I love her, and it would be nice to be physically close with her even if I weren't getting anything out of it.  Other times, though, when I really didn't feel like it, I wouldn't have any problem at all if she masturbated to porn - it would be easy for me, fun for her, and I just can't see anything threatening about it.|`|5WB2yZUFaa	i agree with you. my husbands sex drive is way higher than mine, but instead of turning him down all the time, i just go along with it. we argue if i don't, and he says he never gets any, even if it's only been a day. could you please answer my question? it's called "my husband and i don't trust each other"
Ybo6HS8Caa	Sounds to me like you'd be better off just leaving her alone and finding a nice girl who wouldn't treat you like crap.|`|u1uECuFNaa	"I'd rather live my life lonely and not to have those feelings again"  That seems like an answer to me.

Sounds like she plays a lot of games because she doesn't think you give her enough attention.  If you stay with her, it's likely you will have these issues for a long time.  She doesn't sound like a healthy person, it's just too soon to know if she's going to stay on the right path.

0zdHykkSaa	my husband literally does not lift a finger. on top of it, he's really good at making as big of a mess as he possibly can.|`|r4i1abZYaa	Not really because he works a full time job and I'm currently in the process of being hired so I have been home all day long for the past month. The only thing he does is take out the trash on sundays. But when I worked a full time job, it was like pulling teeth to get him to help out with the chores. For some reason, men think it's the woman's job which is crazzzy!!!|`|pYtXrnDfaa	Hell no.  Wish he would do just a little.  He comes home and goes to the recliner.  I come home and go to work again.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	ya when i yell or get upset|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No because my husband works full-time and i dont work so all the housework is my job and i have NEVER expected him to help with any of it since i'm home all day to do it...He needs to come home and just relax after a hard day at work but he will take the trash out when i ask him to.    We live in an apartment building so we dont have to do any outside work.|`|y8mRKy2vaa	HE DOES MORE THEN ME HE IS A GOOD MAN|`|cR8UZdi1aa	Yes, he does. He's always done his own laundry & does a lot of the cleaning, dishes, shopping & cooking. The only thing is he does a lousy job of it. (HA!) But I know that many husbands don't help at all, so I never complain. Not about that anyways. At least he does it.    This however (here's the disclaimer) doesn't in any way make up for the rest of the garbage he puts me through!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Not that often ...but when he does hes very 'proud' of himself ...* rolling eyes* ......lol      And this answer deserves a thumbs down because........?|`|m81dfyOYaa	Yes, my husband's great. We both clean and both do the laundry.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Yes he does.  Sometimes he does more than me.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	NO! And that's 1 reason why he creeps me out|`|buHzPMHZaa	My wife thinks american women are fat and lazy. We share. If she thinks I'm doing more than her, she chases me out of the kitchen. She prefers to do 75% of the household work, and I prefer to make 90% of the family income.      Something like this is supposed to be part of the whole partnership deal. You're both supposed to be working, one way or the other. I have to admit, I think that most of my guy friends, who all make more than their wives do, and work harder, longer days, all do too much at home... then again, I married someone who wanted an equal, a partner, and not a footservant.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Yes. Does it all the time. We help each other. I help him outside and he helps me inside.
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I am sure that he doesnt do it to make you think you are unattractive  everyone looks at the other sex even when with their spouse - it's only natural to do so most people cant help it.   He loves you right? then trust him to look ONLY that is probably why he got angry in the first place|`|AcmfbJVpaa	I think that wen a guy looks at other girls in front of their girlfriend is disrespectful if I were you I lose him guys like that never change and they are always in the defensive|`|NUgv8iTdaa	Aaaaa the old looking at the old man technique works every time.. But really its natural it doesn't matter who he is going out with they will always  take the time to admire a good looking girl|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Come on, so your telling me you never ever ever look at a cute guy. Please. At least he looks and is not hiding it from you, in a way he's being honest. You, on the other hand, seem to take sneaky looks when he's not watching you. If he looks and doesn't touch what are you worried about. I am really really old and I still look.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	Some people just look at other people, just admiring clothes, hair, height, skin tone, eyes, etc.  Next time you "catch" him looking - comment on something positive about that person. Say something like, "I like her hair, do you think that style would look good on me?" or something similar.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	Well becoming the crazy chick that's always checking to see who he's looking at is NOT going to make things better.  Sounds to me like the issue is with you and not him.      You even said he wasn't staring, just a glance, and you have to go through the whole drama cycle.  All you're doing is making him feel like you're monitoring him like his mother, and that's a perfect way to slowly push someone away.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Everyone looks at other people.  Especially men, that's just the way they are.  ;)  If you really believe he loves you, try not to be insecure.  It's not about how he feels about you, it's just a guy thing, and a people thing really.|`|87pV5lvZaa	Let's face it: it's not like our eyes fall out when we get engaged.  Looking and lusting are two completely different things.  There's nothing immoral about appreciating beauty, and him thinking another woman is attractive does NOT mean that he doesn't view you as the sexiest woman in his world.|`|BObu4i9saa	guys need to look  just 'cause he's looking at someone else doesn't mean that she's better looking than you - just that she's attractive and worth a glance   no guys are ever worth glancing at for you? or do you only look at guys that are better looking than yours?  don't bother talking to him about it unless you've gotten better at dealing with it - he's defensive because he knows you don't want to hear about it   i've gotten to a point where i can point out the hotties to my fiance - he'll agree or disagree and we move on - i also feel comfortable saying "damn he's hot" in front of my guy & he's fine with it   if you trust each other it's no biggie    edit:  so you don't trust him - then leave him|`|xUoJDbd8aa	he's not used to being commited, its old habbit.  Point it out, tell him it is rude, and if he still feels the need to do it try to be less obvious.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	He may not even be thinking about it...  Not to make excuses or say that it is ok but I wouldn't worry about it.  If he is staring or being ridiculous or making comments, not cool...  Otherwise I would say that eventually he probably just won't even do it anymore.  This can ruin your relationship if it is not addressed or if he continues and you can't handle it - so try to let him know somehow that "Baby, I notice you looking at other women in my presence and it really hurts my feelings."  Hopefully if you are kind and gentle about it he will get the point and stop because really, temptation does give way to action - so you have to make sure that he's not interested in more than just appreciating beauty.  Be honest - too, I am sure a hot guy captures more than just one glance from you.  It doesn't mean you have sexual thoughts or want to jump in to bed with that person. Cut him a little slack :)
iIdbPkHuaa	If you apply for Medicaid, they will keep track of the child support that is due to you.  It won't go away and eventually your ex will have to pay up.  When he does get a job, they will also be notified of this so that he is forced to have coverage on your child.  When he works and owes back child support, you will intercept his income tax refund.|`|i2V17yi4aa	get your son his medicine stop all the drama and help your son! seems like all you baby mamas want is money money money it seems like you don't even care about your child your more concerned about who's paying for what. you should of kept your legs closed if you didn't want to take care of this child. suck it up and help your child don't worry about the other parent worry about yourself..    my personal opinion i think that he should just give up all his rights and let you take care of the child by yourself then you will really know what its like not getting any help|`|kFkV7Yroaa	the best for everbody|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Do whatever is best for your son and let that guide your actions. Forget about what is best for the ex and yourself and concentrate on the boy.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Go to your state Dept. of Health for CHIPS insurance.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Give the TennCare office a call and explain your situation.  They should be able to guide you in the right direction.  If they can't answer your questions, call the family court in the county where your divorce is on file.  They'll be able to walk you through filing a contempt charge against him.  Even if it doesn't result in him obtaining the insurance, it may help with your public assistance case.    ETA - I just thought of something else.  If you aren't eligible for TennCare, check into the CoverKids program.  It's designed to cover uninsured children who are 18 and under.  We have a similar program in AL and it's really benefited lots of kids.

TnusF2KUaa	i had the same problem not so long ago. and im the same as u! OMG! i have two best friends that i couldnt live without. but then i have alot of sub-friends that i dont really hang out with. i dont know if itll work for u but this worked for me:    i pretty much forced my way back in. i included my self in the conversations and refused to let them push me out. dont change urself like them. remain who YOU are. if they are really ur friends, that shouldnt matter.    next, try calling. i called them, and after a few minutes we were chatting just like the old days. ud be surprised how different ppl are out of school and away from everyone. the tend to be themselves again.    also, make plans. if u stop inviting them over, ur pretty much begging them to grow apart. plan a sleepover and do activities u know the REAL them enjoys. that'll make them drop the mask.    and PLEASE dont think that there is nothing u can do. i never gave up on my friends. and guess what? we have plans this weekend! my heart aches for you. i know how aweful it was when i thought i had lost my best friends. and it hurts to think of loosing them now.    so go on! next school day, force ur way into the group. then after school, call each of them. get back into ur old conversations. and when everyones all good with eachother again? invite them over! go to a movie! be friends.    Hope This Helps! Good Luck!|`|evEJxv06aa	i had the same problem not so long ago. and im the same as u!

Have you tried talking to them about it? if you have and things haven't changed maybe it is time to severe ties with them and move on to some of your other friends. give someone new a chance at getting to know you. you had to do it with the orginal best friends so do it again.|`|y8LVlmlJaa	this situation is not that uncommon. it's really tough to deal with, i know you've been friends with those girls for a long time... but when people start to act like that, you know it's time to move on.  it will take time to get as close with your other friends as you were with your other friends, but give it time and it will get better
NUciANHQaa	Hey i am actually going through almost the exact same thing. the only difference is ive only liked my intrest for about a year and a half. I go through the same things with her like avoiding her and then feeling angry about it. I to am also pretty shy so we can help each other out. So this is my advice which i am trying. Try to go up and talk to her about something simple like a hey (insert name) and just keep walking, do this every now and then. Then as you get more comfortable with this add in small talk like hows it going or where you going to and then slowly start to make your way into talking to her every dya and eventually try to get her number and her text her every now and then or a friendly phone call. then ask her to hang out as just friends in a small group and if it goes well and she has fun do it again and if it goes good again than you should take the chance and ask her out. i hope it helps and good luck.|`|6US6xhH9aa	You need to have her notice you. i know its hard to do that when your shy. i have that same problem. Ask her to do something this weekend. That might help. Maybe she likes you. She might be shy like you.|`|JHo7g8vAaa	if you don't make yourself noticable, she'll never notice you.|`|VNSERsZ1aa	be like um excuse me but uhh that swim suit shows your azz so nice i just jizzed in my pants|`|dqHt0moZaa	get over being shy and just say hi to her, just go for it even if its hard. and dont think you dont have a chane untail you try. good luck and go for it.|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	talk to her and make friends|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	If you don't talk to her you can forget it, find someone else. you can't expect everything to always come to you :) just force yourself to talk to her, just be like hey, whats up. worst case she doesnt like you back but you still get to know her a little better.     people talk to people who they like. its normal. no one cares if you talk to her, it's not weird and no one will think of you differently. she will probably think more of you, actually, because of your confident.    BE CONFIDENT! it's the key :) the first time is always the hardest, but afterwards you will feel much more confident, even if nothing interesting happened in the conversation. good luck!|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Ask her to the movies this weekend. If you don't then you never will. Trust me on this dude. Been there and done that. Need to feel the adrenaline in your viens. It will be ok I promise.|`|uC0PhlAoaa	I had the same problem, just go up to her and talk, once u get more comfortable just start flirting, cause then she will see how fun u r and she will get this vibe that u like her, then when u think the time is right just go up to her and ask her out "dont do it over a phone or computer cause that is lame"|`|fda1946fb5f4a9a59b01a635bc7076cbaa	im having the same trouble 2 man. wat i would do is ask one of youre friends or even one of her friends 2 see if she likes u or not or if she has like a myspace youtube facebook etc. ask her out on there if she says no that sucks but u have to remember there are other fish in the sea|`|wUEeccrMaa	shes probably becoming less interested in you because shes given up hope. you say you avoid her, when i get signs like this from my guy friends, it really depresses me. so i take them out of my mental list of possibility boyfriends. then i stop liking the guy altogether.    man it up and talk to her, or youre gonna lose her. shes been waiting 4 years. 4 years!!! i usually only wait a few months. thats crazy.|`|MXQYAUuXaa	oh come on give it a try we girls have soft hearts we sometimes like shy guys thats sexy..bt not too shy ....ask her out 4 years is a long time.|`|NB1cbRm0aa	find out what she likes and use that as a way to get across to her, and then follow up with small talk and so onnnn|`|z7IZaYveaa	gain up the courage...no one likes a shy && really quiet guyy...  i mean some people doo...but obviously the girl you like doesnt.  so gain up the courage!!!    come on be a mann(:|`|ogZWVUm8aa	Let her get to know you, even if it starts out really slow.  I'm shy as well, like extremely shy , but the relationship will go no where unless a move is made.  Just say hi :) maybe ask how her day went and maybe you'll end up getting close.|`|cHtAGDATaa	u got to break out of that shy shell.i used to be shy till i got the nerves to ask out a girl.First make her ur friend.after that give her ur Number and tell her to call u.If she is some wat interested she will call u.|`|tu7ef6Q7aa	first of all ask yourself why you like her  if you never talk to her  i used to be like this and now i realize how stupid it was  i would like a girl for a long time until they really hurt me  if you're really shy try breaking the ice with like Facebook or something. It's kinda cheesy but once you get more comfortable around her you can start talking to her at school and stuff  hope that helps  good luck man
fQqAWGTgaa	So... you want to change him a little, to make him into a more perfect match for you... like, you don't want him to be the class clown anymore, and you don't want him to have that close friendship with that other girl...    That about right?  Things are doomed.    Hopefully it will only take you a few years, but you have to learn to accept people for who they are.  Don't argue.  You've already proven you DON'T accept this boy for who he is (you don't want him to try to be the center of attention like he WANTS to be... and you don't like his choice in friends).  And this is only after a short time.    Think about it this way.  have you ever considered becoming a goth chick?  You know... dyed raven black hair, black nail polish, far too much black eye-liner, only wear black clothes, and be depressing a lot.  Would you let this boy change you into a goth chick, if you found out that he is really attracted to them?  Or would you be upset because he did not like you for who you ARE (as opposed to liking who you could be with specific alterations).    I know...  Just relax.  You are pushing this whole thing way too hard.  It will never be perfect, you can't make it perfect, for there is no such thing as perfection.  It is a goal to strive for, not to be reached.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	By all means let him know you like him.  that might calm him down with the class clown part of his life or it might at least settle him down enough to pay more attention to you and less on his clown act.  I doubt he will ever give it all the way up but you liking him might help him.  At least you can give him so lessons on how to react to girls. If the other girl is just a friend then you need to tap that guy before she does but if they are together then back off until he's a free agent.    Hope this helps.|`|UcK4IqJ0aa	i think you should just ask him out, or if there is a dance coming ask him to be your date!|`|kFkV7Yroaa	say sorry|`|iXt3erseaa	Get him when he's out of the limelight. If he plays it up in the spotlight, you can't expect to get anything real out of him. Find him when he's alone and talk to him then. That way you will get a sense of who he really is and he will get a sense of who you really are. But if he's going for the laughs in front of the class, don't take it personally if he doesn't talk to you specifically - maybe he feels to seriously about you to make it into a bunch of laughs! So just talk to him, quietly one-on-one. See where it goes from there.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	just apologize.|`|sROU8U32aa	awe. well are u sure he likes u first of all? u cant tell him how u feel yet-it'd totally freak him out especially if u dont knohim too well. build on your friendship and get to know him more and see where that leads. talk to him more often in class and joke around with him andflir some too. just be playful and nice. mi not too sure if he likes u though since all he did-frmo whatu said- was turn around and look at you. does he smile a lot when you're around and try to make u laugh? check out this link:   http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Lik...|`|T7z68YDTaa	before u do anything try to find out who he likes b/c if u tell him u like him but he doesnt feel the same way then it'll get all akward and ur friendship will be gone dont tell him u like just yet|`|ACpCb1aUaa	Yes he is a teenage boy the only way to let you know you like him is to tell him.Men are slow teenage boys are slower.|`|AOCMiie0aa	Hmmmm, he sounds like a jerk to me...  but i mean i don't know him.  tell him you like him.  and confront him about why he is ignoring you.  if he acts a jerk about him..find someone better!|`|aMgmTN3zaa	Tell him you like him :)  But only after getting to know him a little better..  Just talk to him.. make him understand that you want to be friends, and he's really fun to hang with!  Maybe he just needs you to approach him first.. kind of break the ice :)    Good luck!|`|WI5KmVRdaa	i think you should tell him that you like him who knows maybe he likes you too you will never know until you take the risk and if he doesn't well there is always some one better out there for you|`|m6sCwsyZaa	Don't get involved unless you are going to be faithful to this guy.He might ignore you because he doesn't trust you and doesn't beleive you are faithful.|`|nTPngeajaa	about the omg thing: so if that incident happened yesterday or not that long ago be like that was pretty funny bla bla bla and you to will laugh about it and stuff.     About the girl hes close with: get closer to him. go out with some friends to a movie and invite him there (comedy movie cuz he loves to laugh) and sit next to him so you can laugh with him the entire time.then the next time your at school you two can laugh about the movie or talk about how bad it was.      TELL HIM YOU LIKE HIM LIKE TWO DAYS AFTER THE MOVIE OR WHEN YOU TO GET CLOSER if you blow it dont bother just try to make up the mistake.   Hope mmy advice works (:|`|ieAYDt7Naa	sounds to me like hes intimidated . but i think he likes you|`|YybxuUkraa	Meh..  Guys are weird.  Don't let him know, I think its to soon.  I think you should try talking to him first.  Flirt a lil haha|`|PgW0jJxWaa	yeah tell him. your groaning is minor, he shouldn't be upset at that|`|7oIVBXLiaa	i would tell him you like him, just to let him know. And he could be liking you too and just dont know how to show it.|`|Vh9JtG8Maa	Deffinately let him know. He might be interested in you too but afraid to say anything. I've let too many opportunities slip through from fear of telling someone the truth. Just go for it.|`|iE2Bedtjaa	yeah just talk to him|`|G4bwplVKaa	OK, be careful you don't obsess over a guy that maybe might be interested in you. Trust me, its never good to be a jealous person either.     Maybe, you should try to talk to him once in awhile and build on your friendship. I'm sure he is not angry with you for such a small incident in class and if he is, just apologize and explain yourself. Don't let him know you like him just yet. Boys can get freaked out very easily.    See if he ever wants to get together after school or on the weekend. Maybe with a few other friends. Ease into it, take your time. You have your whole life to fall in love. :)
pytpNUieaa	Only you can answer that question. Everyone is different and everyone has their own opinions when it comes to committing in a relationship. You will know when you're ready to commit. I hope my answer helped and all the best. Good luck.|`|fSSE9cnLaa	No. I've been with my bf for four years and it's great. It just depends on where you both are in your life and what you want. I am monogamous and so is he... so a relationship works for us. Honestly if you both have a lot of the same goals then you won't fight a lot. I don't understand how people can be together who don't get along and I see so much of it. Who would do that to themselves? lol
3GG5Lx7zaa	How about going to his site and having a talk with him. Telling him how it went with drivers ed and the dentist. Its always good to feel his presence there and keep his memory alive. Its nice to treat him as if he's there to spend time with. You know him, how he would have reacted to you driving. He would have been very proud and would not have wanted to see you sad. Spend some time with him.
Nrk9fT8waa	There's only so much you can do, for I can tell you are a good person, wondering how your best friend is doing. YOu've tried to contact, am worried about her, even had contact with her parents. If they need your help, they will let you know. I don't think you should push it for it may be a family situation she is going through!?  However, go with your gut, if you really feel something bad has happened, I suggest you try to talk to her parents one last time and see what happens after that. If they don't "give in," there's really not much you can do, but wait to hear from your friend personally. I am sure she knows you're thinknig about her, and she is also.|`|b5f9eada2ae1ecabcb567944edea3c27aa	You should call and tell her parents (politely) you really care about your friend and want to know what's going on, that you support her and them in whatever is happening, and you can be trusted to know what's going on.  I hope it works out. I was in an extremely similar situation 4 years ago and that turned out okay in the long run. :)|`|6BTvuPwcaa	This sounds like something you may have to step aside and let her parents handle.  Give her and her family space.  Let her come to you, when she is ready.  Hope everything is okay.|`|tsPcAZ2haa	I KNOW YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP BECAUSE YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND BUT SOMETIMES A GOOD FRIEND KNOWS WHEN TO BACK OFF IF SHE REALLY WANTS YOUR HELP SHE'LL CALL YOU MAYBE SHE NEEDS MORE TIME ALONE LET HER HAVE SOUL SEARCHING I DON'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU BUT I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HELP HER|`|n4QSgd7caa	wello she did say the note was very personal and she got very embrassed as well as terrified of whoever found it....sha doesn't want to show her face AGAIN|`|qxs0VPXmaa	i would be very concerned. have your parents call and ask what is going on. no matter how old you are. just tell them you are very concerned and you haven't seen or heard from her in 3 days. but i wouldn't've said you were sick and ran home. i would say not to worry, next time we can write in secret names, or nobody will care in a year from now... just try to comfort her instead of run away next time. good luck!!! i will put you and her in my prayers!! :D (Y)|`|yXbazL5iaa	Maybe you could talk to her parents tell then you are worried, and would like to talk to her. If they say you can't then ask if they will let you know the minute you can, and also tell them that if there is any way you can help just to let you know.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	Maybe she really is having some depression problems and her parents are trying to get her help and just would rather let her tell you later if she wants you to know, maybe they just don't think it's good to let her talk right now or maybe she's just having a hard time and doesn't want to talk to anyone. She could be in a hospital, but if it was something very serious, like deathly serious, then her parents would probably tell you that so it's more likely it's something minor so try not to let it get to you.
32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	I'm 51...my son is 25 and my daughter is 22 (what a coincidence!..lol).  I don't think you really have to have anything 'in common' with your kids in order to relate to them.  You only have to have a story to tell.  My kids and I have the most fun together when we're just sit around talking about how DIFFERENT our youths are/were.  My daughter finds it 'amazing" that I was around before the invention of the blow dryer...and my son is jealous that I spent my youth without ''gramma' being able to check up on me at a moment's notice via cell phone...lol!  And they both get a kick out of my stories about my 'errant youth'...because they can't believe that MOM ever made that many 'bonehead' moves.  The last thing I want is for my kids to think that I was ever perfect.  I also want them to know I"ve been around the block a time or two, and know what it's like to actually learn from my mistakes...and recover from them.  They've also learned very quickly not to try to 'snow the snowman'...if you get my "drift"...(man...I'm so witty sometimes!  LOL).    The best way to start AND maintain communication with your kids is to simply be interested in who they are, good and not so good, without judgement...and they'll automatically want to learn who YOU are in return.|`|1kSRPadaaa	well what are their interests? try and find about them so that you can relate in that aspects. also they will prob be happy to teach you about it if you are willling to listen. ie.. i ride horses and i try talk to my dad (who is 58) about the things i am working on etc and he asks questions etc etc.    to achieve this maybe try to talk to them one on one where you have few distractions.    you could also try a new activity that neither of you has tried as a way to bond like go fishing. this will give you time to talk aswell    just a start maybe|`|8ilHQMq5aa	i talk to my dad about politics and current events and i also call him when i cant figure out if my meat has freezer burn and other random things like that....  oh and we talk about the economy and how much it sucks.  im 20 and my dads 52...  oh we also make fun of my mom (theyre still married, so its not like that)|`|nUkCnrA3aa	"So...how's the weather"....XD It works! It's so korny it HAS to! Ask them what they are interested in :) that usually gets good conversations going *haha singles and dating XD*  -Ryko
pLExaQG8aa	I do. I believe God created someone for everyone. That there is a person out there who was made for you. That you were meant to be together.. Or in other words.. Soulmates :)|`|IgxIrg0paa	yup. i think it's better to "let it flow". we meet our soulmate is a fate.|`|TTP90Ug1aa	Yes. I believe everyone has a soul mate. Love is a wonderful feeling to have and that is why finding that person is difficult.|`|cV22kVBUaa	No and I don't believe in love at first sight or love at all.  No one is perfect but they may accept you unconditionally. That is what sets them apart and I think that's what make people believe in "soulmate's"  I don't really want to find a soulmate, being alone is a prize.|`|71644cb31cad67a3ed79c8d35c2d26cdaa	yes i try to believe that.|`|nyBXPUBcaa	Yes, I do believe that everyone has a soul mate.  I have found mine!    They could be in front of you, they could be across the world, you never know!    My husband came from a place that I had never heard of!|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Uh - NO, that's just some fantasy that advertising firms made up so that people would buy more diamonds and lingerie and crap like that.|`|JAwhXqljaa	no..  If everyone had soulmates, then there would be no people who spend their whole lives alone
3ctchU2faa	A spanking is meant to be a form of discipline and you usually spank someone on the bum.  Getting hit is a form of abuse and is meant to harm physically/emotionally.|`|1c565ebf7059ca3dbee7caecb67dddc0aa	A spanking is on the butt hitting is anywhere else.|`|L6cywARAaa	hit can be with a fist.
iFKuvuGtaa	After I got separated from my husband, the first thing the tax preparer asked if my child had lived with me 6 or more months a year. If yes, then I could claim him. If she is considering divorce then she should see about getting child support. I did this before we got divorced. As divorce is expensive and can last a long time this will help take care of the child in the meantime. Later in the divorce decree they can hammer out the details for visitation.     She should not let him wear her down. You know if he had custody, he would not hesitate to get child support and will make things miserable. I think you are right, she might not get her son back.|`|lbmFP6ayaa	TELL HER TO NOT LET HIM GO!!!|`|LC8iYnncaa	because their getting money and think their the boss of everyone|`|AA11138696	She needs to get proceedings started and have the custody issue settled legally.  This man sounds like he would snatch the kid and without a custody agreement he could well do it legally.  The boy stays with the mother so she has him most of the year, she claims him on her taxes.  I think there is a way he can claim the money he spends in child support but maybe not.  Your sister has some legal issues and this guy is not gonna make things easy so she needs to get to court fast and first.  Good luck|`|RnJwKF97aa	why is he so far from his son?  did the mother and son move away or did the father move?  more backround info is needed before giving an educated answer.    But, I would never let my son be away from me for a year.  I hate if I can't see him for a day|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	Divorce  will settle  visits  times,  tax  claim  ,  so  on.   She  should  prepare  herself  with  exact  proof  of  all  money,  clothing,  food,  whatever  he  has  donated  for  court.  She  should  not  give  in.  It  is  his  way  wearing  her  down.    It  will get  better.  Rules  will be  set.  She  should  also  keep  tabs  on  his  tag,  car  make in  case  he  does  not  return  child  from  visit.  Take  photo  of  vehicle  and  keep  photo  of  him.Keep  current  photo  up  date  of  child  as  they  change  fast.  She  should  make  copy  of  decree  and  keep  with  her  till  things  settle  down  and  original  in  safe  place. Police  will respect  what  it  says and  no  delay waiting  to  pull up  court  record.  This  child  is  way  too young  to  be  moved  state  to  state  and  Im  sure  Judge  would agree on  that. Help  her  stay  strong.
TwWuCGUEaa	she may just wants to be ur friend|`|SLUV1JM0aa	be yourself! it's cheesy and washed-out, but it works.|`|zFsBCsiCaa	you seem like a pretty awesome dude but...    my best advice: change some things. stop cussing, just live life extremely HAPPILY. you're probably already happy now but become even happier, easy going and goal-oriented at the same time. do everything to train yourself be reallly happy, from the inside. i swear, it will start to show on the outside, not from occasional bursts of great speeches, which show your capability, but instead from your every move. it will not only cause people including very pretty and cute girls to be attracted to you, but you will be the most successful in every part of your life    good luck email me if u want bro|`|bimwlw0qaa	she doesnt like you yet. she is kinda interested in you and wants to get to know you more and hang out with you . she would start really liking you after a few dates. so just talk to her, be friends with her, ask her out gradually and see how things turn out to be. it is not a big deal that al other girls hate you but this one thinks your cool. there will be many more like these.|`|oqubJQhJaa	I went through something kinda like what you are going through. My advice would be that you need to learn to love yourself and accept yourself and then other girls will see that in you. This girl that came up and talked to you probably see's that there is more to you than meets the eye but she doesn't know how to approach you. Learn to love yourself. I have been watching this movie called "The Secret" you should look into it. It has really changed my perspective on things. I wish you all the luck and that I helped at least a little bit.|`|nLiCiRnSaa	i think she's just talking to you because she like your speech. and what do you mean by dark?|`|T7z68YDTaa	she might those type of girls that like guys with nice personalities instead of looks she might like u for who u are..and if shes new then maybe she was looking for a friend and thought u were nice..or she thought u were nice or she pitied u and started talking to u just to be friendly
AA11490722	i think either summer colours as somebody else suggested or nice pastels- with pastel coloured roses for your flowers|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	Resist picking trendy colors like bright pink and orange.     Go with something classic this way when you look at the pictures you aren't like woah **** that's tacky.... I like a baby pink or peacock blue with black ...classic. But that's just my taste|`|y6gVmhHxaa	We did black, white, and silver.  It was very elegant.|`|tBODwcqXaa	For the summer, I suggest blue & yellow or even orange & yellow. Different colors stand out, and bright colors will be very "in" this summer. (Hot pink and lime green are making a comeback!) Good luck, and congrats!|`|9hPnvmuzaa	Your birthstones|`|1KfbgBupaa	Pick your favorite two colors, then add a third - let these be your wedding colors... or, look at bridal magazines or online sites and find a look that you think is classy.  Let your florist help you decide on flowers in those colors in a price range that you're comfortable with.    Keep in mind that blue flowers are available but that flowers that are dyed blue aren't usually that pretty.  There are also other colors that you could pick to be your wedding colors but flowers won't be available in one of those colors - thus the wisdom in picking 3 wedding colors, not just 2.|`|7JFUiBoKaa	Summer flowers, could be pastel or dark some greens and pinks. I had Silver, Navy Blue and White. It's up to you really.|`|TofGV3JIaa	i think RED pink & white and even some gold would be reallly adorable.   and if you dont like that i think any light pastel colors would be great .. summer colors.|`|uKL1txc4aa	Purple and yellow would look really nice together. And yellow is a really good summer color. Silver and a light blue would also look great.Hope this helps! Have a great wedding!!! :)|`|H5uDrIagaa	Green and purple|`|iYWEwg0Maa	That depends on what you want to accomplish.    Easy to colors to work with: White, black, pink, light blue, (occasionally red).  These colors are avaliable most of the time in most wedding items.  It's easy to find odds and ends that work well with these colors.    Hard colors to work with: Any color that is not a standard color- lots of greens, purple, orange, grey, and variations of these colors.  These colors are harder to find.  If you want to incorporate them into your wedding, start looking for items NOW, as you will have a much longer search!    I got married 1 1/2 weeks ago, and I went with black, white, and hints of pink.  It was VERY easy to do, and it came out incredibly elegant, and surprisingly unique with the accents we used.  I suggest using basic base colors, such as black and white, because you can always find items in black and white, and then picking your favorite color and using it as an accent color.  Example: Our table linens and napkins were black, but there was a white napkin in the center of the table that the centerpiece sat on.  Each napkin was in a pocket fold, and sticking out of each pocket fold was a pink gerbra daisy.  You see, the base of everything was black and white, and I just put touches of pink here and there.  I hope this helps!  Good luck!!!  Congrats!!!!!!!!|`|3WQOa4sraa	right a list of your favourat colours and see how you can create combinations you like that also would be good for a wedding    My colours are tiffany blue, white and silver     mainly poeple pick 3 colours which blend well together, having one colour stand out and the other colours are little touches here and there    duck egg blue white and yellow  http://images.theknot.com/ImageStage/Obj...    yellow pink and white  http://aboutdetailsdetails.com/blog/wp-c...    purple and white  http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mVNQFjdp3b0/SF...      sage green browns and cream  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2382...  theres loads more just do some searching

They evacuated the whole auditorium!  It was in fifth grade but still|`|GTbB08fOaa	thinking a stranger was my dad and got lost after that|`|JNvVW0bHaa	well considering this question is in the marriage/divorce section, i'm gonna tell you the funniest thing that has happened with me and my new hubby. it actually just happened last night, so i'm still laughin about it. okay, so last night we went out for one of our friends birthday. i was driving, so i told him it was okay if he got drunk. so he got REALLY drunk. we got home, and he totally passed out in the bed. he was on top of the covers and didn't have a pillow so i took care of him and got him all situated. well, appearantly he went to sleep before he could go to the bathroom. and i woke up about 2 this morning and the whole bed was completely SOAKED. he had wet the bed! i know most people wouldn't have laughed about it like i did, but i thought it was just so funny that he got so drunk, he didn't even wake up when he had to use the bathroom. haha. so everytime i talked to him today i called him pissybritches. :) i love it.|`|6004c09a1497ae22f6d3fe8cff3c4060aa	When my oldest son was just 2 years old we went camping up in the mountains.  One night the sky was so clear, and the stars were magnificent, so I thought I would sit on the hood of my old 1964 Chevy Impala, with my kid and show him the stars, and hoped to see a meteor or two, as they are easy to see in this part of California on a summer night.        Well, up in those hills it was very very quite, and the only noise you could hear was the sound of hundreds of crickets making their usual cricket noise.  My son, who was an avid TV watcher said to me "Daddy, what's that noise " I said " Son, that's just crickets ".  He laid there for a few seconds, and said "Dad, Turn 'em off !

Too many to list! But the most recent funny thing happened to me just last night. I was just finishing brushing my teeth so I could go to bed when I heard the phone ring. It was late, and my wife and I were both exhausted, so I was shocked when I actually heard my wife pick up the phone in the bedroom. Turned out it was her sister and they started talking... and talking... and talking... and talking... etc. I was so exhausted I didn't feel like arguing about it, so I just laid a towel down on the bedroom floor and went to sleep there. LOL!|`|u3sw0LMpaa	Cedar point- My shoes fell into a hole and i had to walk around barefoot...

Don't force friendship. True friendship takes time, effort, understanding, forgiveness, patience, and lastly, a true friend will always want the best for you. If you just met this guy on myspace and have barely spent time together.. don't get your hopes up. Friendship takes moments, minutes, tears, laughs, hugs, years and most important.. friendship needs nurturing 24/7. It's almost like a job. I've noticed by personal experience, that most of the time, true friends find you.

Don't push, but be a good listener and share what's important to you.  Don't try to cram in every detail, but try for being natural and speaking from your deeper self.  And have fun.  If she has fun, that is probably your best bet for getting a next date.|`|vGsieKI1aa	idk, i just think its a little too early to tell|`|P1rCZPxFaa	nup.  you should've ponded her on the first date.|`|TBbf0dQZaa	well...she wudnt respond to u in the 1st place is she doesnt like you so YES mr.optimistic, she likes you...!!

One of them ended up backing out due to money issues which then left me with 5. My 5th girl pretty much decided to put herself in the wedding because she co signed on my wedding dress card for me (I have bad credit). Although I love her to death for doing that, I couldn't take how she constantly wanted to talk about how she did this or did that with her wedding. So I told her just recently that I was cutting back on bridesmaids due to the stress I was having with having so many girls. She got really upset (her husband is still in the wedding as a groomsmen) and now we dont really talk anymore. But I can honostly say without her being part of this anymore I'm not as stressed and I feel like I'm going to be able to enjoy my day without having to worry about everything possible|`|Q1MI6L96aa	You better do something because the drama is not going away as the music is being played.

Good Luck!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	your question is not a question. If you want to know how to go about doing this you might want to try the etiquette section. If you are asking if anyone has been threw this I can't say I have.

Just tell her that you have changed your mind and don't feel guilty about it.|`|iXt3erseaa	So tell her that you changed your mind. It's your wedding. You can do that.

They do it without a second thought. LoL    No but truly this is your day, you need to think about what YOU (the bride) wants and what is going to be best for YOUR DAY!    I mean if you 2 havent talked in 2 months its not like you have much to lose. I think the worst part is actually telling her but once thats over you can worry about much happier things like the color of the napkins HeHe    Congrats on the marriage!!  Hope it all works out|`|dTEbLgvEaa	If you reduce your number of bridesmaids to 2, then yes.  You can tell her that you have reduced the size of your wedding to cut expenses and perhaps hurt no feelings.  Or you could ask her if she would prefer not to be in the wedding (giving her the option).  Either way, please be kind to everyone and don't become a bridezilla.|`|BNiqgEt1aa	its your day, just email her....and tell her stop making everyone so tense and you want your day to be happy and smooth|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	Etiquette would say that once you've made this decision, you're stuck.    However, obviously if she is obnoxiousness enough, you put etiquette aside.  The real question is what turmoil will it cause in the rest of the family.    If, for some reason, you had to lose a groomsman and a bridesmaid for another reason (only room for 6 people in the limo or something), would they be the ones that you would lose?    Gotta say though, you'd need to be pretty desperate to start playing that kind of game.|`|DqetlSB6aa	yes....hopefully she hasn't bought her dress. if so she might have a case against you for price of the bridesmaid dress- since they're nonreturnable and she only bought it for your wedding.    But id tell he I no longer want you in my wedding.  you're drama is something i don't need right now|`|6db9945ff407961b87dcdc1c2327d1dbaa	Hmm.. ask you fiance if she's still invited.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	I would take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle.  I would put all the good things about keeping her on one side and all the bad (or potentially bad things) on  the other side.  See if the positives outweigh the negatives.  It's YOUR big day, your memories, your photos.  BUT if she's all drama and you axe her, it could get create a really bad vibe at your wedding, a day you want to be filled with peace and love for you and your family and friends.  It might also affect the rest of your life with your husband's family.  How would his mother feel?  Would she respect you less?  It's her daughter, right?  But then again you might always have a sick feeling for the rest of your life when you see her in the pictures.  Just ask yourself which things are most important to you, and then you'll know what to do.  But I would decide soon.  If you do decide to get rid of her, it's best that she has a long time to get used to the idea so she has less of a chance of stirring up those bad vibes at the wedding.
22EVxBYWaa	omg i was in the same situation. he would always complain about my best friend being annoying sometimes and i feel bad now tho cuz i would always agree with him. then he ended up liking me all alongg.(:    hunn, as long as ur best friend doesnt find out, its all good.    answer mine?? go to my profile && click on da latest question ive asked.plz && thank youu(:|`|WJoWBBR9aa	i think you should tell him, cuz if he finds out that you knew, then he might get really mad, and not even talk to you as a friend. That happened to me and my friend, i told him that my she was cheating on him and he still thanks me today ahah.|`|ENIQAxDhaa	and he;s is the best guy I have ever met, perfect for her (i like him too. but i wouldnt risk there relationship, and my friendship over it.    DID YOU NOTICE YOUR WORDING, SHOWN ABOVE. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D LIKE TO INFORM YOUR GIRL, SO YOU CAN HAVE HIM FOR YOURSELF. YOU NEED TO BE OVER IT. HE'LL FIND OUT ON HIS OWN AND HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T INVITE HIM INTO YOUR BED. hee hee that, "best friend"? besides, (one week) known? I wonder what a guy can get for one week and a day.|`|2dgHgxhtaa	ive been on this situation before but the best thing to do is let her tell him on her own, dont get involved. Your her best friend your job is to be there to tell her what shes doing right or wrong, not to go and tell the boyfriend whats going on.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	that friend isnt such a great 1  if her bf finds out she'll be like _______ already knew!  and he'll be like u didnt tell me _______? How could u  and all of u would get in a fight  so tell ur friend ur gonna tell him if she doesnt quit cheating|`|4UcPvGVVaa	you should keep trying to convince your friend to stop cheating. don't be nice about it. tell her straight up that she's being a dumbass    honesty is the best policy!|`|5jMNBO2naa	some friend you got there    they say you are only as good as the company you keep    and that water seeks it's own level    so personally i dump that so called friend  with a person like that, how much of a friendship could there be ?|`|VP8TiqEmaa	No you obviously like him more you should go out with him. But first tell your friend if she doesn't stop cheating ill take him kinda thing.|`|9HHL34Q1aa	that's always a sucky situation.  i had a situation like this last year and basically what i did was i told my friend that her boyfriend was a great guy and she was lucky to have someone that paid attention to her and loved her so much.  i said that he didn't deserve to be cheated on and she knew that what she was doing was wrong.  i basically gave her a couple choice: either you break up with your current boyfriend and go for the one your screwing behind his back, dump the one your screwing and stay with a guy who actually cares about you and i told her that if she didn't decide by the end of the week then i was gonna have to tell her boyfriend what was really going on.  they ended up breaking up because she went for the other guy (which i hate) but i think it's so much better this way.  her ex boyfriend is so much happier then when he was going out with my friend and i guess it turned out alright.  you can try what i did.
wFWytGlxaa	I have expressed my feelings to guys before and it seems to me that it never works out. So for now I have taken to just sitting back and not saying anything. If he's interested he'll tell me, if not -- oh well.    Good Luck!|`|eqWftUQeaa	I can't tell you why... cuz i'm the same way. it's very hard for me to express mysef|`|Tf19RETiaa	oh please, guys are just as hard to read as girls, with all there stupid mixed signals and they cant really express there feelings, so there like hott & cold. its like i lovee you or shut up i hate you immature crap. we do show signs but usually guys dont pay much attention. well atleast in highschool.|`|bTLwhwR3aa	Ha! i never hide my feelings|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I don't know, but when you say "Geeez" like that, it makes you sound just a little gay.|`|PMUBOVOfaa	it depends on the girl.   i know if some guy I liked asked me out or said he liked me I would show I;m happy. and if some guy i didnt like asked me out i'd be like 'sorry dude. I'm not intrested.' plain and simple.  but if you werer to ask my friend amanda she would hold in her emotions untill she came to me because she would be affraid you would change her mind about her.  Depnds on the girl and the way you go about talking to her.|`|R9AEpBc0aa	well we're shy or we dont want anyone knowing quite yet. most of the time if the relationship is deep, the girl will express her feelings...|`|prrtDPLTaa	Simple. Because they are scared of being rejected or scared of being perceived as a flirt/sl*ut.|`|iBKue4JFaa	girls want to play hard to get cause thats what guys want!|`|gZtTBWMGaa	find a girl who wont hide her feelings if u hate it so much dude. i never hide my feelings. when i was in high school and i had feelings for someone or liked a boy i told him straight up. thats how i got my current boyfriend.. he even says now that if i had never told him that day that i liked him he would have never told me he liked me back because he was 2 scared.|`|T7z68YDTaa	probably b/c their shy or doesnt think guys will understand and maybe think that their werid if they feel that way or think that what they say they feel is stupid to the guys|`|Bngsrgpgaa	I never hide my feelings. If I wanna cry, I'll cry. I don't care where I am or if I'm being looked at, I'll cry :D    I don't give a crap what people think, I can't control what I feel.|`|2F4vkfnxaa	okay, i don't express my feelings.  but the reason is because i just don't want to seem stupid or say something embarrassing.  like if i am being quiet around him, i am probably hiding the fact that i want to say that i like him alot but im afraid that he won't feel the same way. well maybe that is because i have a fear of rejection.  my crush asked me if i was okay because he told me he was moving and i straight up lied to him and said i am fine just because i thought if i said no i am going to miss your or don't go or something he might see me differently, like clingy.  idk. thats just my personality. and i have to find a guy who can decode my feelings when i don't tell them.|`|dc51ffef1b2154e5b6339df35c2db720aa	Well I'm sort of scared that the guy will end up hating me, ignoring me, laughing at me, or telling all his friends what I had done. Nothing worse than when I put in a hell of a lot of effort into something and then the guy stops talking to me. I would LIKE to just tell the guy upfront that I like him. I'm not afraid of rejection. I'm just afraid of what the guy will think and his reaction to that. I'm also scared of what his friends think.|`|iuzLxZPhaa	We may be afraid of rejection. It is a big issue these days. And we may be processing if you are the best guy for us at the current time.|`|i1Xu137Baa	they scared there feeling going to get hurt we they put out to a person|`|DzsU5lsgaa	i dont hide my feelings but some girls think that if they dont then they will get made fun of or laughed at if they do show their feelings for guys cuz maybe they dont like them back|`|TofGV3JIaa	well chris first of all not ALL girls do that. some girls are actually opne about thier emotion. However, girls do have the same fears certain guys ahve and that is rejection. Since at times girls are not sure about how the guy feels they dont really want to put their emotions out there and get hurt. So they tend to hide them until YOU  express your feelings to them first and thats when she will begin to open up hers. -=D|`|YnagHG04aa	i don't!! i want everyone to know how i feel so i can talk to them about everything without having to hide... so it really just depends on the girl.
t0iwLdVQaa	I think you should give out traditional invites to the people you want to come. Those who can will have to understand that you cannot afford to invite everyone. I think word of mouth would be the worst move because people who weren't invited might assume that you just forgot to tell them.|`|7CKipTZOaa	If you aren't particularly close to people then they shouldn't be upset if they aren't invited.|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	invite only the co-worker that you are better friends with|`|7JFUiBoKaa	I highly doubt that the people you do not talk to will even come to your wedding. You could just send the invitations directly to them in the mail. You are not insulting anyone, it's your special day.|`|DqetlSB6aa	send invites to everyone who's invited-including coworkers.  don't do word of mouth- cause everyone who hears the word- might not be who you want to invite.  don't do emails-people might forward to folks you don't want to invite.  make it official send out invites|`|y6gVmhHxaa	You do not have to invite everyone if you do not socialize with them.  Normally in a small work environment you want to invite all if you are inviting any but if there is a huge office you can't be expected to invite them all.  If anyone who is not invited has anything to say them just tell them very nicely that you had limited space.  For those you do choose to invite though you need to send a formal invitation and skip the e-mail.
0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	it seems like you are getting the more-than-friends vibe.   but just because a girl gives you her number, doesn't mean she likes you!!! i would know from experience|`|RSEp960aaa	sounds to me like she likes you!|`|lbeHwVGTaa	U never know until u get to know her. Be friends and then go from there. In my opinion i think she was just kind of u know teasing u(not like that) or playing with u|`|CqldGgFCaa	uh she gave you her number   she likes you|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	she went out of her way to make some stupid joke about giving your number to the teacher, trying to throw that out there so you would ask her for her number, and you finally did...so ya she likes you..jeez sometimes guys are so slow we have to be really obvious    =)|`|pizsAvupaa	Watch wat you do...love can be a B @*h!!!!!! at timez...so careful who you fall 4|`|Rs06K4aLaa	She wouldn't give you her number if she just wanted to be friends ;)|`|AA10668656	GEEZ! She gave you her phone number didn't she????
AA10604300	The bible/ God himself permits divorce for a born again christian if   adultery has taken place.      May I suggest Salvation for you,   in order for God to help you endure your heartches?|`|rcut6bhoaa	You have to look at him as a person.  Become closer to him as a friend.  Slow yourself down and realize that HE is the one you are with.  I know you cant forget, but you can forgive.      your new beginning was just that.  There really shouldn't be anything you can bring up on him since you got back together, unless he has done something since then.    Are you perfect?  He isn't either, so move on with your lives and look at him for the partner he is to you.    GOD will help you all out too,  just ask him!|`|Rzsudrzqaa	Of course there is hope.   You have to deal with the resentment/fear/insecurities caused by him even if you have to see a therapist.    Your marriage will never heal if you always bring up the past. I know how hard it is... us women remember EVERYTHING lol.    I really wish you the best of luck.|`|rH33ty23aa	It will only work if you both try very hard. Yes what he did was wrong, but you cant throw it in his face every time you argue. Its mean and probably the fastest way to get him back out that door. If has given you no reason not to trust him then you need to find it in your heart to trust him again. If you are both committed to making this work then you both have to give 100% to get this back on track|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Yes marriages do make it after one of the partners have an affair.It takes a lot of trust to get back what you had.If you are going to think he is out with someone else whenever he goes out why bother being with him at all.Sounds like you have low self esteem .Why don't you just show him that you are still the girl that he married.Get yourself a new hairstyle and a new wardrobe and let him do the worrying whenever you go out.Also when the arguing takes place don't throw the past up in his face.That's just hitting below the belt.|`|u2xm5RoQaa	no matter what happens he did what he did. the real question is why did he do it.i for 1 never with hold sex,thats usually the problem if there not getting it from you they will find someone else.or it could be cause you like to argue and he wanted someone to be affection it with.your not going to be able to for get the past, but you really need to quit bringing it up. its not doing anygood.if it was you wouldnt be asking us this question.yeah hes got to gain your trust back.but in a way you got to gain his trust back too.hes not the only one at fault.so before you go on with your arguing again.ask yourself what have i done to make him do this.|`|rQfzifT7aa	Not unless you let it go.     You made the decision to give it another chance so you should have been ready to start fresh.    There will always be this thing in the back of your mind but if is up to you to control it. You can make yourself miserable by wondering what he is doing or is he looking for someone else. You are only hurting yourself. And frankly, I just couldn't live like that wondering what my spouse was up to. It would be a miserable life.    Either let the past go or let your husband go..|`|Dym1Xfquaa	yes, but when he was not doing anything to make me believe he was cheating again I had to change my perception and get support from other positive people, eventually if you keep acting indifferent you will push he away. you made the decision to get back so forgiveness goes deeper than just saying it out of our mouths we have to physically do the things that say we forgive.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	It can be done. As much as it hurts to know he has been with someone else, you did agree to take him back.  You need to stop throwing it in his face when you argue.  You should be able to discuss your feelings with him in a calm manner.  When you accepted him back into your life, home, and bedroom - you forgave him. Forgiveness means you put it behind you.   You will never forget what happened, but to make your marriage last, you will have to move past it.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	Yes, they have made it, but it takes a lot of work and prayers.  If your husband has not given you any reason to believe he has done anything wrong, then he probably hasn't.  I don't know the circumstances of him going out on you.  If it was a one time thing, he may really be remorseful, his actions will show you that.  If it was an affair, that is something different.
4qqtc3dLaa	High school: Crap, and probably the majority is a waste of time. and it's a b1tch. but then again, it's a life experience.    Gay people: All the gay men I know are so much fun to be around! I like to hang out with them because we always have the best times.    Friends you don't like: I tolerate them. Only if they pass a line do I find a sly way to get away from them    cats: I personally never likes cats. There meow bugs the heck out of me plus they have the weirdest eyes.     pests: What kind? Bugs of Human ones? Well either way, I just swat them.|`|z7IZaYveaa	i love high school(:    idk...they dont really but mee.    i dont really like cats that much.    what kind of pests?  but no not reallly...|`|ICOmnGIUaa	high school: one more yearr till im there!!  gay: annoying voices and style clothing  friends dislike: anything they do pisses me off  cats: arent as good of pets because they are always hiding i prefer dogs  pests:i think a lot about them|`|szX346DFaa	High School makes me look thin,  Gay people they are still human being,  Friends I don't like they stink like rubbish bin,  Cats are definitely not my favourite thing,  And pests will make most people scream! :-)|`|nWoESULQaa	I think high school is a crazy place where everyone comes together and trys to learn..:D  I think gay people are just happy and that if you pick on them your gay..But they are not welcomed in my home cuz they are homo    Friends i dont like arent really my friends     Cats are lazy animals that just sit around and make you their slave-get a dog    Pests can be destroyed with bug spray if they are bugs or humans       lol|`|Ti476VHkaa	High school is full of memories    Gay people are so ewwww    I like all of my friends    I hate cats but I love kittens    Pests get on my last nerves|`|0QFKm3WLaa	High school - hmmm depends of the school and the people in it.    Gay people - they can be themselves, although many people don't accept 'em, because they're not mature or don't know enough.    If I don't like a friend - he/she 's not a fiend.    Cats - woow! I looove to hug them. I adore them, they're my favourite animals.    Pests? Heh! I like to bottle them in a jar :))))).|`|soFPdaf9aa	1. I love High School. I'm currently attending it and love it!  2. Gay people? Love 'em. I'm bisexual, so I may be biased   =P  3. I don't make friends with people I don't like, silly!  4. Cats? Yuck! Allergic and I think they're a little overrated.  5. Pests. One word. Kill. Smash. Throw away.     Quick and simple|`|fSSE9cnLaa	1. It's over... and I'm over it  2. Gay people are none of my business what they do   3. If I don't like someone... they aren't my friend  4. Cats bring home gifts...usually in the form of dead animals  5. Pests are just that... pests... they should die
IG4A4nuDaa	AHHH GET THE **** OUT OF THE FRIENDS ZONE  she doesn't like you, she is using you as an emotional soundboard, you are the NICE guy.  If you want her, you should shorten your phone conversatiosn, say you are busy, or something.  answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|T1z1SGe3aa	dude ask her out.  if she has any decency she wont make a big deal over it.  say something like  you:"remember you wanted to go out withme last year?"  her:"yeah"  you:"want to start now?"|`|PMUBOVOfaa	aww. thats so cute.  but she probably sees you as the sort of 'gay best friend' type of role.  you should invite her to hang out and stuff. And if you can talk for three hours in person to then ask her out.   because if you keep this whole thing up, she will only think of you as the 'gay best friend' even more.  i think its time to test your relationship.|`|mFkfJwLOaa	those are the most F'ed up signals ive ever heard of in my whole life. You should tell her she deserves someone better than him, and if your risky enough then tell her she needs a guy like you ;), but i think she likes you because of those calls, MAYBE she wants you to say something first by making you a little jealous i say just go for it|`|MLvqdUwLaa	test her by keeping it low until she is over her boy. if its still a convo every night, she is a keeper.|`|cVDZIuaOaa	Of coarse she likes you, what would give you the feeling that she doesn't.  Any time a girl talks that much to you, you can tell strait away she is interested in you.  And maybe at first she just needed someone to talk to, but obviously she has grown to like you more and more since she keeps trying to talk to you.    I wouldn't listen to her old boyfriend, sounds like a bunch of Bs to me.|`|zFsBCsiCaa	i wish i had that with a girl right now. make it hot and stay out of the friend zone tho|`|Vk7AvXZPaa	Ask her out.    If you need more help email me:    joshuajurado@steelersfan.net|`|pCyyjeAwaa	Of course this girl likes you.  You said that you only hung out like 3 days throughout the summer and now the two of you are talking on the phone every night.  That went really fast.  The girl wants to be your girlfriend but she doesn't really know what to do.  It could heavy on her mind that you are the friend to one of her ex boyfriends.  I would call you more of a friend to her.  Try to step your game up to her and see how the relationship goes.|`|FyhaFk05aa	Your friend is just trying to vent her problems and explain everything out to someone. right now your wondering 'why me? im a guy, i dont understand'. she is doing this because other girl friends of hers have big *** mouths and spread rumors and ruins her life. Guys, not so much. You could ask her out if you really like her and make her feel better about breaking up with her last boyfriend. I know thsi about girls because i have several girls venting on me. It helps with serious relations with your partner in the future. cheering her up.     i got off topic but the main idea is she probably is nto over her last boyfriend and is using you, a friend, to vent on. It is not a bad thing that she is using you but she just needs support.     best of luck to you and hope this helped!
lZLtEyodaa	Don't risk your friendship for a guy.  Don't go with him, and save yourself from hurting your friends feelings.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	your friend will be jealous but if she is a good enough friend then she will forgive you and be happy for you|`|NoT3WGaEaa	Hey he asked you already right? Then just go if you're friend gets mad then maybe she's just not being a friend.|`|TlQW67MFaa	well talk to ur friend about it. and if she doesnt like the idea. then ditch the guy.  just ask your self whats more important a guy you kind of like or your best friend?|`|W9B6EJrWaa	This happened to me, too.      So the three of us went to prom.  Then we moved to Utah.|`|X1V5Unaaaa	not so sound lik any other person, but if shes your real friend she'd support you. so maybe jus talk to her and let her know, so shes not out of the loop. you know?|`|OvgzBpvtaa	sigh, i dont know|`|lnzeM1m0aa	go with him, trust me ive been there and later i realized she wasn't even a good friend for making me stay away from someone i like.    just say "i know you will be pissed, but me and ____ are going to prom. i know you like him but i do too, and if he asked you i would be happy for you, so can you please be happy for me?"|`|TC9w2nNNaa	screw your friend well not rlly :)  just tell her that you really like him and that he asked you out  if she gets mad, that is her problem  if she was a good friend, she would be happy for you!|`|nTPngeajaa	KKK calm dwn. this is simply very easy.   1. ask your friend to sleep over   2. talk about how much you like him (dont let her talk about him)  3. persuade her to let you go   4. if she does SAY YES!!!|`|hU3iy7Tzaa	i'd say talk to your friend and see how she feels about it. if she reeaally doesnt want you to date him, you're gonna have to decide which one means more to you.|`|HPCetoNkaa	Well you gotta decide who is more important to you. If your friend is a true friend don't jeopardize your friendship for a guy. Just look at the situation from the outside looking in. What would you think of another girl went out with a guy her best friend liked??|`|tHnyVzEEaa	is shes really ur friend... she'll understand V__v otherwise she's not worth it|`|Eq4ZZJoTaa	She's your best friend she should understand, and a relationship is a two way conversation, if he dose not like her its not like they are going to magically get together. When this happened to me and my BF and I ended up getting the guy, of coarse she was upset, she was rejected but then she was happy for me and then moved on and got another boyfriend and we even double dated... and life was good. She's your best friend, those last no matter what, and if not, they are not your best friend and they are immature|`|2dgHgxhtaa	no guy is worth your friendship. TRUST ME. Would you like it if your best friend did that to you?|`|dtGy6YPYaa	Go with him, have fun. If she gets pissed tell her that she shouldn't let this guy ruin your friendship, if she insists on being mad/pissed then she isn't the kind of friend you should keep. Because friends should never let a guy ruin their relationship.|`|PVrEBujSaa	I would ask your friend about it. If she has a problem with it, then apologize and move on. If she seems fine with it, then say yes.|`|3LMx6m7taa	tell her that your sorry that she feels that way but u like that guy and he likes me so im going with him     it will be rough but shell get over it|`|mbsj4ggEaa	okay so I haven't been through this but I willl say this if your best friend is truly a good friend she will want you to be happy and she will be happy for you.... and even though best friends are great you can't just turn down a guy you like because your bff likes him you have to follow your heart remember you only live your life once so make it worthwile hope this helps! Good luck! Lemme know if you need anymore help!|`|G4bwplVKaa	She would have gone if he asked her... or would she had thought of your feelings?|`|95c2929336859361a8f5aac01e713a06aa	You've got to live your life for yourself. Of course your friend will be hurt. But don't argue with her when she confronts you. She will hate you for a small time and then appreciate your honesty.  What means more: your best friend's doctrine of "If I can't have him no one should", or a chance at making yourself happy?|`|0ky4TktEaa	She needs to look at the bigger picture. Yeah she likes this guy and it would piss her off to see him with you of all people. But he doesn't like her. I don't think you need to tell her he thinks she's ugly; at least not at this point. It's a pretty harsh thing to say and you should save that should she decide to have a real snit about it. Go ahead and tell him yes. He asked YOU; not her. That is a fact she can't ignore. If he's made it clear he's only interested in you, start spending more time with him without your best friend around. The growing attraction will become more evident the more time you spend with him. Eventually it will come down to either your friend getting over the fact that he doesn't want her or if she's so petty as to not be able to accept that, you may need to find a new best friend.     I haven't been in this exact position but close enough. I've had a guy like me but his ex, who was a sort of acquaintance of mine, wanted him back. He'd moved on and it was clear he was interested in me. That didn't work since i was on and off again with his best friend. So yeah, big clusterf*ck there. Nothing but relieved when all 3 guys went in different directions. Me and that "acquaintance" never did like each other and aside from the guy we both liked, we had nothing in common. Anyway, not even sure how that has to do with your story but whatever. My point is, go for the guy. She'll either get over it or she won't. If she doesn't, it just shows how immature she is.
9ZnYAfi7aa	it takes a while    you become friends with them  and ones u guys tell each other everything ur best friends i  guess..        I'LL BE UR BEST FRIEND xD|`|Prq0QuLfaa	It just sorta happens, some people say that you have to be friends with someone for years for them to become your best friends but i think that it just sorta happens, i met my best friend like 8 months ago.   Its just someone who understands you completely, someone you know you can tell everything. A person you always want to be with.|`|nxQgtvr8aa	Get to know them, talk with him/her as often as you can, and get comfortable with each other.
EICm5lkIaa	sweetie u cant move out but u could always talk to them thats very important, tell them how u feel. if u just cant. talk to an aduly, a family member, or a friend. maybe even someone from school. good luck and srry to hear the hun! good luck and follow my advise. i know how u feel|`|JX82ysInaa	Hey, omg I know how you feel. my mom's a single parent right now and we always fight ...    ahhh I want to move out of the house too ...      :(    (By the way I'm 12 too turning 13 in a few weeks)|`|sbvkPGAcaa	YOu dont tell her  ARE YOU CRAZY?  you are only twelve  no matter what your circumstances are you must not move out|`|b9DhpqhUaa	No offense hun but you are only 12 you cant go anywhere.

But you could always try talking to your parents and maybe seeing if you could go see a therapist to talk these things through. Or you could talk to the guidance counselor at your school.|`|rs4KLnJraa	You don't do it, because it's illegal? Also, if your parents are that bad you could possible live with your other family members if a court thinks your parents are unfit to take care of a child.|`|6pthHPKmaa	Ok, first if you do move out, where are you going to go? Dont move out just cause your parents are fighting.|`|s2Mbl533aa	You are only 12.

Fi8AIi4baa	Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do  Listen to your heart; when he's falling for you  I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why  But listen to your heart before he tells you goodbye.    If you want to go out with him, then now's your chance. If you want to wait and just be friends, then do that. Whatever you honestly want to do. Just think about the pros and cons of both options, and then go for it.|`|NamyNqDLaa	you never know, he might've turned 'good' so... i think you should try.|`|23303c716fcc561c771bc0c9c020c7d8aa	i feel da same way about someone eles dont go with him im in da 6th u just get played next thing u know u feel better and likes some one eles|`|tfkHZXYTaa	there is no such thing as love around your age.the guys want is **** as many girls as they can trust me when i say this..|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Ummm.Not this time.He will do the same stuff he did with your friends. Don't screw up your life.
b8xCuitVaa	lol been there done that...honestly if u cant handle it anylonger...do it..stop waitin for him to come to u...take power...show him how u feel..have balls and it will hurt if it doesnt go the way u planned it...but come on do u really want to be stuck in that boat...jus friends...its time babe!!! prepare urself...u mite lose a friendship...u mite make it stronger...hell u mite make him realize that ur the one for him...but jus do it..u'll feel stupid...but relief ...u will beable to breathe...kind of lol      goodluck babe|`|qZH9K6aEaa	Move on.  If you are free when he breaks up with this one, jump on it and don't miss another oppurtunity.  More time in regret is not worth it.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	wait it out.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	its possible he doesn't realize you like him more than just a friend I would tell him but its best to wait until hes not with a girlfriend|`|e8c16daec78515a3d1e688e1e62a940faa	i have been there, i eventually moved on and found a great boyfriend.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Just sleep with him and get it over with.  You won't like him so much after that.  No one does, sounds like.   Meh-heh-heh.|`|UyHLvhloaa	Wwoow girl, I've think you have been waiting WAY too long! He's obviously not shy to ask you out cause he has had 3 girlfriends this whole time, I think he just doesn't see you in a girlfriend type way he probably really enjoys being your friend and nothing else. If it's just super hard for you to move on and forget about him and you ever dating then give it one shot and tell him exactly how you feel, if he doesn't feel the same way then you KNOW this will never work out because it takes TWO to tango :D So you should move on and go out to meet other guys and stop waiting on him, good luck!|`|s2ni59xZaa	u should move on ond continue to be his friend and if something happens with him and his gf like they break up then express to him how u feel and maybe he will open up back to you. so until then, continue to be his friend and move on|`|NamyNqDLaa	why dont you make the move after he's done w/ this gf... ??  wait for him|`|f4hb5nCCaa	my advice to you  my friend, don't dare to show that you like him...he'll be using you only........Forget him.|`|23303c716fcc561c771bc0c9c020c7d8aa	u should maybe move on or wait it out but not to long|`|PgW0jJxWaa	move on|`|7hAiw408aa	Keep your own options open and just see where things go as time passes. Don't consume yourself with the thought of getting together with him as it may not ever become a reality. But that doesn't mean you have to abolish any thought at all. Just keep this one on the back burner and see where life takes you two.    If the guy your talking about really is the bloke for you, then things will work out in the end.    Best of luck|`|PEg8otB1aa	I say wait it out. This guy had liked me forever, it seemed. I thought i would never like him, he was like my best friend. I liked other people and that one boy who liked me through anything would always be there. I finally realized that he is the one who I really liked. So maybe if you keep with this guy and try to be on the more flirty than friendly side sometimes, he will pay more attention to you.   :)|`|N5jQuNCRaa	Wait it out. Tell him how you really feel. |`|q0gYw3twaa	wait til  the  next  breakup and then drop some major flirting waves and see if he responds|`|qUT4AnPeaa	first are you guys good friends? if u are then i don't think theres nothin u cant ask him. ask him if he likes someone and see wats his answer. wait for a while but also give him hints that you're interested.

PEg8otB1aa	Definitely give him space. If you guys broke up, that means either one, or both of you wants a break from this relationship. If it is truly meant to be, it will happen. Don't force it back to where it shouldn't be.|`|vfj4kyGIaa	i'm dealing with the exact same problem, and just give him space and time, although my ex rarly ever talks to me. but just give him time, he needs to realize what he missed out on.|`|v1a5Zr07aa	Just give him a space ,but not too long..Then grwappp him and kiss him as much as you can and make he happy whenever you feel that he want to talk to you again..Renew your feelings and make things better.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	I am currently going through the same thing. My ex broke up with me. I think he still loves me but he is unhappy about how we fight. It is best to not call him. If it was meant to be, he will come back. But you do not want to get hurt also. That is why I saw do not call. It is hard because there are times I want to call, and text. He only ignores me, which hurts worse. So, I don't call or text.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	give him space|`|WDL0BWjmaa	Just give him space.  Let it work uot naturally and dont force it.   Absence makes the heart grow fonder>

With two other women, doesn't sound like it'll be the most secure relationship.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	because he's a loser|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I think it shows incredibly poor judgment and tons of immaturity on the part of the man.

Leave him. He commited to be with both those other women. I wouldn't put up with it. When he comes back, all of you are going to expect him.    But wait, who told you this? Is there ANY reason at all they would lie? Did you ask HIM?|`|DqetlSB6aa	Id honestly talk to them to see if they're in th same boat.  But really if he got close enough to other women to propose...hes been cheating on you.  You'd be building a future on very rocky ground.|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	why would you even ask  the question "should I stay?" Let me ask you, do you want to stay with a man who proposes to 3 women? It doesn't matter who's ring is real and who is fake, the issue is that you weren't the only one he proposed to. You are not his number 1.
y8LVlmlJaa	He's clearly attracted to you, not sure if he "likes" you or not though, you'd have to actually talk to him to figure that out|`|432deb00cae326e960171b8b94849ceeaa	I doubt it.|`|B3jpU4Jraa	yes i think he likes you alot|`|p2L4AB5Laa	pretty much|`|tzwjSxGtaa	he wishes sexual intercourse to be completed upon you, and possibly wishes to have birth be given|`|6PNuFgTJaa	Sounds like it!|`|hwuamu91aa	he's imagining you without the clothes on. we all are|`|TEqxfG3Maa	creepy!|`|kNTP6HWbaa	Well if hes talkin in russian i would stay away from him, hes probably pretty weird|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	that or he just wants you badly.. like sexually|`|ZfPKN1PHaa	This is most likely the case.  He made it seem like he does like you, I've spoken in foreign languages to people that I liked before, but then I usually had to tell them what it meant :P.|`|ivBbwSTdaa	he probably does that with all girls dont get ur hopes up sweety sorry but thats reality for you|`|Y9DrtROKaa	Uh-YA DUH! what r u doing??!!

fkwhlZ7Taa	do it and enjoy every bit of it ..becos you will always come back home
bhY9Dz6Saa	i did this once he was out working and i decorated the house with roses and wrote a message on the bed that had a heart and said i love you and his name. in roses and prearls. but also i left little notes as he went in the house saying something sexy to him and leaving a piece of clothing with the note also the note would contain an arrow indicating him where to go. its really exciting and wonderful. and also unique cause usually guys do these type of things but if you do them its something new and he's surely going to be suprised and is going to love it. i hope this worked.

You can contact -Focus on the Family by Dr. James Dobson and they can put you in touch with a few groups. They have a toll free number just google it. One of the groups might be "Mops" but dont quote me on that name.  2-Contact your local preschool, and do something like humble yourself and explain what u r trying to achieve. Or you can do a real small amount of volunteer there just a couple of hours a week should get the job done in making contacts.  3-Call your county and ask them if they have any mom support groups.  4- Visit and reach out to your local kindergarten teacher she may have names of groups or indiviuals who would love your company.  Best wishes, that should put you on the right course. Blessings!!|`|7X8nQQSFaa	Take your kids to parks and day care centers.

pFKfBuIUaa	life is what you make it. your happiness is a state of mind. if you want happiness, then just be happy. it's your choice to suffer. sure people have bad luck, but you have to realize things could be much worse. you're not alone. don't frown because it's over ... smile because it happened. at least you're worthy enough to even have had a boyfriend.|`|nC8GRKxhaa	I think deep down you know the answer to that - if your goign through this all at one point in time, obviosuly its goign to be extermly difficult, you will feel hopeless and depressed. It is all happening at once, and you feel like you have lost control of all the situations - that is not uncommon to feel the way you do. You wouldn't be here askign if you didnt already know - life can be beautiful, but at the moment you are having a very difficult time. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS - THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER FROM THERE. You are goign through alot, once things naturally mend themsleves and things being to change and fall in place - you will have the oppurunity to start takign control of these things. Just hang in there, yes you will feel sad. But you will only get better - You can only feel true happiness in life if you have experienced true sadness - you can not have one thing without the other.     I wish you all the best.|`|mBczFuLmaa	It does get better I promise...just takes time.  I know that doesn't help much when your hurting because we are all impatient and want it to be good right now...the one thing you can not give up on is your faith...pray and pray alot and eventually you'll start to feel it in your heart.  And cry when you have too....trust me, I've lost a lot in life, but with a lil' time and faith you'll look back and realize it was just another stepping stone in life....head up, you'll be okay I promise!
domEftoIaa	to me it seems like the only reason why he is keeping her around is to make himself look good. if i was her i would leave him and find a guy that treats me like i should be treated. not used. in a way she could be a keeper for him cause she might be able to change his ways a little. but in order for her to stay he needs to change the way he treats her.|`|Prq0QuLfaa	i dont think so, it seems like the guy is being an @$$
wZgYKTs2aa	Don't listen to all of these gay comments, I'm a girl and have had a crush on 2 guys before. The way I made my decision is bc one guy was so sweet and alleays joked around with me. He wasn't too sweet that it made me feel akward like make fun of her A LITTLE like without going over the top but make sure she knows your joking!! Touch her occasionaly without being creepy just like pat her on the arm or push her chair with your feet when you say somehong to her, allways smile. Text her no more than once a day!! She will be turned off if she gets 5 texts from you. Try just doing it every other day unless she text you first! Just remeber be yourself, smile, be charming, flirt!!! Gooooood luckkkkkkk that's how the guy I chose won me over!!    P.s. Don't just ask her out on a date unless u know for certain she will say yes, she may get nervous about it. First just ask her to have a "movie night" or somthing at a friends house. One of my friends has a theatre room with 6 chairs, and we allways invite 12 people (usually couples) so they will sit together and then my crush so we have to snuggle during a scary movie, you'll be able to snuggle, without feeling nervous bc everyone else in the room is doing the same thing :]|`|gCvMS2KEaa	ask her out, you never know what youll loose out on if you dont try it|`|dd2ba774d8ddf095b0cca5b357d1456caa	Run to her boy.

Tell her that you want to let her decide, and you are not going to force yourself onto her. If you really do like her, then you should be happy if she is happy.    She doesn't need to be in a relationship right now, but if she decides to, let her know you are there.|`|LNEWbymsaa	You should be really sweet to her and get her to like you more but you should defenatley ask her out before its too late|`|BJQCt30Maa	your in middle school. you are a child. she doesn't know what she wants and therefore wants both. you should not over pursue her and if she really likes you she'll come after you. girls want what they can't have so work that card. don't get caught up in it though. this whole thing is just your hormones flaring up, you'll get over it in a month.|`|JpXiKJ8Aaa	Tell her to choose.|`|53suqgP4aa	Win her heart over.

Soon you'll capture her heart and she'll realize who she likes better. : ) Good Luck|`|C0RR8LWvaa	Speaking from experience here. If the girl is that important to you, you should tell her exactly how you feel. If she still doesn't know she is too immature to be in that sort of relationship and you need to stop wasting your time.|`|nTPngeajaa	Maybe go and do something with her in a group without the other guy and get to know her better then ask her out like two days later so you can get closer to her so she will more likely say yes to you.|`|AOCMiie0aa	WIN HER OVER.  be polite.  play hard to get.  don't be pushy for her to choose...that can turn her off!  Don't get obbsessive and clingy.  just be calm with  her and make her fall for you.. hard.  make yourself seem much better and worth-while than the other guy.   If it turns out the wrong way...then forget it.  You could find someone better!|`|X4leB44Baa	Ok I have a little story for you.    When I was a junior in high school I had the possibility of dating 6 guys. I happened to just get out of a relationship and was in the market to date around. Well I decided to get to know each guy first before picking one to go out with. There was one kid Mike and another named Paul that I was particularly interested in. Mike and I grew to be great friends but because he had made a deal with my ex-boyfriend he was too chicken to ask me out. Paul on the other hand found out what my ex was saying to all the guys and stood up to him. His exact word were "he's a big boy and he should get over it". Well, a few days later I decided to ask Paul out because he was not afraid to go after something he wanted (me). We've now been together for 6 years.       Ask her out. Don't let yourself be intimidated. Show her that you are the best choice.|`|P4F1rcfoaa	hmm|`|pORmp0tfaa	She sounds immature. Maybe you should find someone who can actually decide who they like|`|RoNQpMjdaa	kill the other guy|`|8ZARrsnXaa	talk to her, why should the other guy matter?|`|uSbTuiAJaa	You dont need a girlfriend play WoW for FREE  Watch www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7y4ogpBU1Y and find out how to get WoW for free on a blizzard server|`|EkA6ha4Taa	wupe that ****** *** and kick him in the nuts and then hire a gay guy to suck his dick then call the pricipal and make him suck his nuts there happy|`|vIYDiF7saa	go with the flow. It is all about time till she chooses either one. Because you are yet dating her, it is only "like" stage. Unless you guys are really dating then you have the right to ask her choose cos you don't wanna share pleasure with other guy in the same plate.|`|OjErdnzraa	the best thing to do is let her choose but you should have a deep talk with her about how you feel|`|dbTrKkguaa	Get her before he does, DUH!!|`|fnEv1p30aa	get her first  make sure|`|GV0lW4O6aa	i am currently in that exsact situation only im the girl in ur story that likes two guys, you have to fight for her!! i'm going to tell u something, if one of the guys i like were to write me a song and sing it to me i would pick him in a heart beat! go out on a limb for her because she probably wants to see who wants her more. if you make her see that you are the one that is willing to do anything for her than she will choose you.|`|f3265e6e564af0f5d6c3c04f02637cfeaa	First you should say to yourself what am I doing worring about this girl. No truly I no its hard b/c i just got through the same thing. Except I was the dumb girl who liked two guys. Honestly there is nothing you can do but be YOU! I wouldn't be too forward with her just back off for a while and let her make the decision don't sit in the background and be the other guy though. If she really likes you it will drive her INSANE (as one of the boys I like did the same to me) that your not talking to her believe me she will come crawling back. But if she does be smart and tell her you only want it to be you and her or theres no deal. If shes not up for that then shes not worth it. Plus you've got senior year ahead of you and then college, believe me the best times of your life are ahead of you and a girlfriend may not be in that future..    BEST OF LUCK and remember  EVERYTHNG HAPPENS FOR A REASON!! PROMISE

Your daddy loves you so much. It sounds like you live with your mom. Meaning your dad see's you less than when he was in the home. Stop being selfish stand tall tell those who say anything about your name be proud for your sake and your dad's (and all of his family they would be sad and hurt too)  Remembering stand tall be proud - your dad has been hurt enough..You will have this name you got at birth until get married or adopted by your step dad....I am sure your dad would not give you up to your step dad so you can not use his name legally!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	In his eyes, changing your last name is like a slap in the face.

If you like how things are going, then agree to meet her somewhere public, like a casual restaurant. Sounds like she may still be on the rebound a little, so be cautious.
y6gVmhHxaa	If you are walking down an aisle you can have  flower girl.  If you are not then there is no point in having a girl to throw flowers.  If you are getting married in a chapel there is no reason you can't wear a veil.  If your dress is more informal than a typical gown that look up birdcage veils, they are making a huge comeback.|`|MwVcSXr4aa	the point of having a civil wedding is you can make the rules.  you want a flower girl...get a flower girl.  you want circus clowns...do it.    and civil weddings don't have to be done in a court house, you can do them anywhere.|`|StJGeiFyaa	you can do whatever you want. its your wedding.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	You can, but you will get a lot of looks.... it's done at the courthouse, it's extremely out of place to wear a wedding dress and veil and to have a flower girl. You will need a witness.. but a child will not count.  Trust me... I would be embarrassed wearing a wedding dress and a veil with a flower girl at the courthouse.     You could always have a "real" wedding in the future to renew your vows or have it blessed.|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I had a civil wedding, the judge came to the hotel and married us just before our reception.

4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	About the same amount that women marry and then try to reconnect to an old flame. It is not a gender-specific thing. In any case, if you have even a little bit of brains, you'll stay as far away from the ex as is humanly possible. Doesn't matter why he is doing it. The facts are these:    1. He is your ex for a reason.  2. Anyone who would sneak around on their wife is bad news.|`|CpTQagJOaa	he is not in love with you...he just thinks about his days of freedom every now and then...wants to feel like he's still "got it"..its a male ego thing, it is probably his way of learning to say goodbye to it...try not to be too hurt or confused and don't take it personally..he is a married man now with a baby...say goodbye to him too.|`|L38M9lrLaa	sounds like my fiance... if his name is matt ball tap him for me|`|60FT7Pzcaa	Feels tied down|`|sx0PpjvAaa	He's messin with your head and it does sound like a very simple thing to do.
OHeEn7VQaa	1. Stick with your friends. It's harder to get picked on when you're with other people. Plus they can stick up for you.   2. Fight back when people pick on you. Don't let them think it's okay to harass you. If you don't say anything they will just do whatever they want and think that you're a push over.|`|qPIKmhzaaa	try to confront them and ask what is it that you don't like about me that i do , and try to change it . if it is something personal that you do tell them that they have to deal with it cause your you and they cant change that .  tell them that if they have a problem with you to tell you and to stop gossiping about it .     and tell them they are really immature for picking on some one just to feel secure about themselves , and that its pathetic , stand up for yourself and own your natural rights as a human being|`|ij9N9r5waa	as opposed to violence as I am I gotta tell you, you gotta punch the crap outta someone,  might get beat up , but the other animals will respect this "Heart" and stop messing with you.  sucks but it works|`|aFwBk871aa	Laugh with them!    Bully's hate it when there subject does not get affected from there bickering!    They'll stop!|`|qnAbIS4zaa	i have the same problem. there is a kid at my school that picks on me lets just call him J. today he threw a pen at my head but i just ignored him but later he threw a pencil at my head it didnt hurt but it was annoying. so my advise is to just ignore the bully but if it turns into physical violence tell your parent/guardian.|`|EcMDlB3Faa	It's terrible how cruel and foolish kids can be these days! :(    Anyway, I used to be picked on a lot when I was a bit younger. Mostly because I had an interest in something "nerdy" (which I don't anymore), so that made everybody laugh and tease me. I used to get very emotional, and either cried or yelled at them back. But I've realized a lot of things since then.    One of the main things to do, and you have probably heard this a lot, is to ignore them. That's right, if they come up to you and call you a name, don't say anything. Don't look at them, don't talk to them, just stay sitting there and pretend you do not hear them. This will confuse them and they will try to come up with more things to tease you. Remember, kids are really dumb these days, so they might make fun of you for doing the right thing, which is ignoring. But if you keep at it and don't do anything involoving them, they will get tired and annoyed and start letting you go. Trust me, this actually works!    Another thing is to tell a trusted adult. Whether it be your parents or teacher, they will always listen to what you say. I know, a lot of times you don't feel like you can trust your parents or feel like you can't say anything to them, but think about if a little kid came up to you one day and was crying. You asked him what was wrong and he didn't want to tell you, but you know that no matter what it is you will try to help him. That's how your parents feel. And getting it off your chest will help a lot.    Another thing to do is stay with your friends and always think of the good times you have with all of the people that you love and love you back. Don't go hanging with those so called "popular kids" who are just titled that because they are mean to other kids. They may seem like they are the top peeps at your school, but even if you are a "nerd" (nerds rule! :D) pretend with all of your "nerdy" friends that you are the top peeps. And remember, don't think about the negatives but the positives. Which would you rather have on your mind for the rest of your life, somebody beating you up or a GINORMOUS COOKIE? O_o In the words of some guy I heard on the radio, always look on the bright side of life!    Well, I hope this helps! Now do me a favor and tell those bratty kids to get themselves a life. :)|`|2dgHgxhtaa	ignore it and tell them to screw off.|`|uANyGu2paa	fight back i used to get picked on and then when i started fighting back they didn't say anything to me|`|lML34aM2aa	ohh i wouldnt let that get you down. Just remember, people pick on other people because they have nothing better else to do and because they don't feel good about themselves. If they start to pick on you, just ask like it doesn't bother you. ANd if it gets worse, tell a teacher or your parents. Just remember they are either jealous or just retarted!! I hope i helped!! Nobody should be picked on!|`|Py6OzrFjaa	I grew up being picked on a lot at school. Pretend that you think it's funny as often as you can. If you can't, make some sarcastic comments towards them or just give them a look and walk away.     Keep in mind that when they just look at each other and laugh, it means that they don't have anything else to say. When they resort to violence, it's the same thing, but that's when you should tell an adult what's going on.      If nothing else, just walk off and find something else to do. Don't be dramatic or react too much, and eventually they'll lose interest. Just remember that eventually it's going to be better for you and they're never going to be the only part of your life.
v8FlpPbGaa	if he said he doesn't want to be more then just friends but knows that she likes him more then that, why is he like provoking her by calling her all the time about things he should be telling you and sending pictures messages and talking to her for hours on the phone. its not nice to you. i think he must like her more then friends or he likes that she still likes him as more then friends and still wants that attention or feeling but maybe he would never do anything about it. just tell him you aren't jealous because i don't think this is jealousy, its about fairness. i don't think he would like it if it were the other way around and the history behind it. tell him what you think|`|3BvRAGcQaa	well, for the most part it still sounds very innocent. its okay for guys to have girl best friends and the other way around. She is quite a ways away and it seems like he has chosen you. Don't be offended that he goes to her for her problems. Just as you may go to one of your girl-friends that you've known your whole life. He has known her for a long time and they have a long trusting relationship. I think right now, its perfectly fine. Don't take his friend away from him. but if later on its making you more uncomfortable, just bring it up with him and speak your mind, calmly, don't put him on the defense. Then it looks like your jealous. Honestly it doesn't seem like anything at all. They are just best friends. Its very healthy to have best friends that aren't your boyfriend/girlfriend.|`|HGfUY3lbaa	i know how your bf is feeling like my first love and i are still friends but like we date other people but i know she just wants to be friends but even tho we date other people i still love her and would do any thing to be with her its really hard to get over the first love im still trying and im doing it day by day|`|IQq0wNqQaa	You have every right to be upset.

That's the way I see it.|`|Vp6kysz5aa	To me.. I think it's alright for you to be jealous even if you trust that person... I'm pretty sure if someone was in your position they would be jealous too.. From reading your story.. I feel as if he still has feelings for her...or if he is asking her questions that you feel he should be asking you then did you try thinking that maybe you're not around that much or you're too busy or maybe your tone to his question? you should just tell him how you're feeling...|`|dDJiuoOEaa	i believe he still loves her they say your first love is your true love i think u should look for a new boyfriend good luck with this|`|ivBbwSTdaa	hmmm..... this is a toughy but i think that u should confront how you feel i mean if u had guy friend like that he would also feel insecure bout the relation jus tell him wassup and tell her to back off lol but seriously or u could give him some time and space and see wat he really wants cuz i think he is confused and tell him ur not gonna wait for ever for him to come around he needs to make a choice and be committed to you!! cuz ur his girl NOW not her
bhY9Dz6Saa	i would say it depends on how much you know your partner. you can get him something simple like a cologne or something more deep like a night at a hotel with roses. also you can get him clothes of good brand like lacoste etc. or you can go for video games or movies if thats what he likes. there's always something that he might want to get for himself that he doesnt expect for you to get him suprise him like that. for example my bf wanted once a certain video game and i went and got it for him without him even expecting it. lol they love that.|`|J3lUKBKPaa	personally i say you dont want to get him something that is expected or normal persay i mean last year i sent my husband a dozen roses and a card and the look on his face was awesome he even had a tear in his eye i no that sound kinda fruity but hey it just let him no that i love him and it showed him in a new way in an unexpected way ya no|`|NoxRviCRaa	it depends on how long you have been dating. u could get him a cd or a video game, or new lingerie for yourself. hee hee. or just chocolate and a card.|`|Pq2RCVCmaa	Give Him a ******** or have sex with Him I love when I get those as presents I hate pretty much everything else because ether I have it or dont need it.

Hahahhaha yeah I know thats pretty foul, but its basically true, all guys are thinkin that, and "f*ck yeah whos the man", when they're about to have sex.  thats it.  we're guys    ==============    also, we like to be complimented on bodies, face, being good at a sport we do (aha wrestlingggg =)  ), being funny, cute, smart, cool, good clothing style, a funny joke we just told, etc.  We like being complimented on ANYTHING.

Different dresses is okay though.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	It would be better if you had the same fabric.  That way the sheen or matte level will be the same, the draping of the dress will be the same, the sounds made (swish or rustle or whatever) will be the same, the way the dresses fit will be the same.|`|7JFUiBoKaa	Do what YOU want it's your wedding|`|Km2nzm3saa	SAME MATERIAL    Different materials will give the color different looks, even if the tag says they are the same.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I think the same material will look better.

Someone to hangout with and have fun with cause obviously being by yourself all the time just isn't much fun.|`|pSy88C9paa	yes.  within a relationship, it is the most important part.  Friends are equals.  In love, with all the stereo typing and gender issues,   lovers are not always seen as equals.   So friendship give you a common ground. and a place to go and communicate when issues get tough|`|kWNLVQwWaa	Yes, friendship adds a lot of quality to life! Without people to turn to in your life, a person can feel a little empty at times. The more support you have (and the more support you give) your life is more fulfilled!

People I grew close to and loved...it is hard...  but illness and death are a part of life.  I applaud you for being there for your friend.  Still, consider this...life is so precious. What do you think your friend would think of you taking your life into you hands such as cutting yourself?  What you do to honor your friend is live you life for both of you.  Do not take your health forgranted.  There are free hotlines where you can talk to someone.   Please know that you are not alone...  and call and get some support for yourself.   And I am sorry that your friend is having to deal with cancer.  I wish the best for you both.|`|n776D1j6aa	That breaks my heart.. I've never cut.. and yet i've never lost anyone to cancer (yet and hopefully never) but i have lost people very dear to me.

Maybe something that you know looks really bad on her..and talk her into wearing it.|`|Bngsrgpgaa	You could talk to her?

Jesus you act so helpless....|`|bf5967409a091f5003e6a1c89cea1199aa	Patten and copy right  what ever it is you suspect that they might copy, then when they copy you charge them!                                       :)|`|4AzWJfNlaa	dress ugly and if she follows u then now u both look ugly. i dont know where im going with this answer but maybe im right. oh well. 2 lazy to click backspace. alright im done typing|`|cw2qwk9Uaa	get over urself...|`|1H8xK1ZZaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel!! I hate it!!   Okay so you need to tell her to back off and stop acting like such a poser and get her own style because if she doesn't then people are going to start noticing and shes gonna look like an idiot. its for her own good.|`|wiJmJ7gNaa	i believe that the best way is to tell her exactly what you feel-frustrated. To resolve this conflict, help your friend find her true style. Sure, she can have some same styles as you do, but tell her to be creative and choose her own styles that expresses herself. Maybe you can go shopping with her and make her try to choose her own clothes without your opinion, just to give her confidence. I think that a major component on why she's doing this is because she feels insecure, and feels that she needs those compliments. Or maybe she's trying to attract someone...?|`|E25Ty3cnaa	WOOOOOOW u r really important, i bet ur  a movie star and she is a groupie.. getting compliments is a regular thing for u??? damn u are way important|`|ZYfRjTanaa	Tell her straight up.   One of my friends has the EXACT SAME PROBLEM,  but she never tells her, only me.  It's best that you tell her because one day  you won't be able to stand it and just explode,  so just say it now so it'd be less crazy|`|Mv51CBoNaa	Instead of critizing her, why dont you help her find her own voice. :)|`|MejGuWr0aa	I would suggest you be honest with her. Not mean honest, nice honest. Just explain that being unique draws more attention than being a copy. Tell her, or even help her, to find clothes that are perfect for HER and not just get stuff you wear and/or like. I can't guarantee that this will work. It all depends on what kinda person she is and how she would handle this. But being honest, in my opinion, really works out for ya in the end.|`|qxs0VPXmaa	ask her to stop.... shes kinda wasting HER time trying to be like YOU. That is not supposed to me offensive though. Just ignore her, and try to seem as unimportant as possible. She is just looking at you as a role model :D but be nice to her.|`|YowJoHdAaa	all girls havee sumone that does thatt  i noo a chiikkk that does that too shee  coppies mee butt i dnt lett it gett to mee  bcuz its whateverrr lett herr do what shee  pleases its like a compliment too youuu  obviously shee looks upp to you forr how   youu look. i hope that makes sense ha.|`|8BM28r0qaa	THANK GOODNESS!! You're not the only one :)  this girl i HATE copies EVERYTHING i do... she's hated by everyone so she tries to look like me to be more popular... this is what you do... if you can USE her, be mean once in a while... like ignore her but talk to her the next day so she'll be scared. (she will cuz people get scared if their so-called role models hate them)    if she's not important to u  IGNORE HER COMPLETELY  EXCLUDE HER OUT OF THE GROUP  MAKE HER STOP  :)  this works  unless she's superwitchy|`|lhLGeCrtaa	Wow, I used to have a friend who's like that, but she only does it in projects or assignments. Tell her that the way she acts like you getting annoying and tell her too that it's better if we both have different styles.|`|n4QSgd7caa	well i will just have to say if your not certain because of that reason change your style just a little bit and if she conutining doing what you do than talk to her nicely and ask her "why did you change your style?'  or 'your style is different why is that?' just you know if she dont take it the right way than explain yourself and the way you feel!!!|`|WrVbB5rsaa	"D M" wat the hell is wrong with being emo!??!|`|riZelipdaa	Copying is the highest form of flattery, but if it is driving you insane, talk to her. Just remember, some people feel a sense of security in copying other people's actions. Since she feels that what you do works for you, it should work for her too. Sit down and tell her that you don't like her copying everything you do.|`|2WjfwMOjaa	1Remember it is a form of a compliment what she is doing. She notices and likes your stlye.    2-I would consider sitting down with her and tell her in a nice way" That you could not help but notice everything that you do - she then in return does it also."And give her a couple of examples so what you are saying has some meat to it.    3- I would preface it by paying her a compliment about something- anything about her that you think is cool. Because obviosly she is a bit lost and insecure to need to copy everything you do.    4- Dont be mean when u tell her because she is ur friend and must - as I said be lost - to do this. Just tell her there is a part of you that is flattered but that it is reaching a point that it is becoming annoying.    5- You will do great- Just lay out the facts in a kind way that I suggested and add your own twist in how you say it and the exact words you choose.    Best wishes and you will do great.  Blessings!|`|Ky3qvD4Qaa	Whoa Ginalawson is a *****!!  and erica rules.
73c6084fbad1e11c3464ca98280bfa78aa	Grandma...or mom , whatever we are calling her, needs to come clean, as well as the alleged "sister".  This is just a load of crap.  Let the anger be directed at them...where it rightfully should be before you even set foot into that picture honey.  What they did to her was wrong.  They robbed her of a mother/daughter bond, her father/daughter bond, and a family she could have had all along with your family had they been honest.  Getting a professional isn' a suggestion, it's a must.  This could go so many different ways depending on that child.    Call Dr. Phil.|`|YHcyuka3aa	That wasn't a very good way for your husband to see his daughter and it was very cruel. IMO    However, the damage has been done. The fact remains that this child needs love and a good parent. God works in mysterious ways and it's good that the child is in reach of you both and that you both want her. You might want to wait to explain all the things to her if you think she will be hurt or if you think it will be necessary to tell her in order for her to have a good home, then you have no choice. You might skip that her grandmother isn't her Mother and just go with the fact that your husband is the Dad for right now. The important thing is the child, the details will only confuse her. Don't break up the home NOW, help the grandmother as much as possible and be there for the child. Breaking up a home that she has been in for all those years will only add more hurt. You need to stay close to the family for the child's sake.|`|AA11138696	You need to stay way out of this terrible situation.  This is going to hurt this child and that should be the first thing in everyone's mind.  They must all first decide if they are going to tell the child the truth and I can't say what they should do about that.  They all need to get to some sort of counselling so that there is professional help for this poor child because she is in for a terrible blow.  Good luck and God bless you all, especially that poor poor little girl|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I think it's time for everyone to slow down and take a deep breath.  Your husband hasn't been proven to be the father.  Until he has been, he has no rights whatsoever regarding this child.  Step one in this whole thing is for your husband to speak with the child's grandmother who she knows as mom.  He needs to express to her that he believes he's the father of the child and that he wants to be a part of her life if he is determined to be the father.  From there, a DNA test should be done.  The girl should absolutely NOT be told anything about the DNA test or her suspected parentage.  As far as she's concerned she's going to the doctor and the cheek swab is part of a checkup.  If your husband is determined to be the father it will be time for another meeting with the grandmother.  At that point everyone will need to work together with a licensed family counselor and a child psychologist to determine what the best way to approach this situation should be.  The child's best interests have to be kept at the forefront of everyone's minds at ALL times.  Proceed cautiously on this.  It's way too soon to be so fired up, and being over zealous could prove devastating to this child.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Wow, this is really big. You have to put the needs of the little girl first. I think your husband, the birth mom and grandma should schedule some family counseling together to hash out what is the best thing to do.  The three of them really need to get it together for her sake. Good Luck.|`|3ctchU2faa	This is a very complex situation that needs to be mediated by a professional. This child has been lied to, and when her "mother" dies the whole truth is going to eventually come out.  The best thing to do is seek a counselor's or another psychiatric professionals' opinion. This is very dangerous grounds for you, the "sister" and the young lady involved. Ask the professional what your next steps should be.  I hope everything works out for you all.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	I think you should tell her who her father is she has the right to know before someone tells her. Good Luck|`|Xhaa1nVNaa	thats really nice of u...well just be there for the little girl and tell ur hubby to also b there for her|`|UZxeBrxQaa	A lot depends on the relationship the girl has with her "sister" at this time.  If her birth mother is distant and uninvolved, then matters simplify quite a bit.    Problematic is a situation wherein the birth mother wants in on the deal and becomes a nuisance in your marriage and life.    There are no easy answers here.  Remember, the little girl has some say in this matter as well.  What will she think if someone she doesn't know, wants to become an integral part of her life?    Further, there is the question of what the grandmother feels about this matter.    There's a lot of people who need to get together and discuss this, and if it can be resolved, there needs to be a legal agreement drawn up and signed for the protection of everyone involved.  An adaption may be part of the equation as well.    Are you ready to take on this kind of complication?  I would like to think you are, but don't try unless you are willing to go the distance.
73c6084fbad1e11c3464ca98280bfa78aa	The IRS does not take the time to read our family court cases unless you appeal something honey.  They go by your filing status and what you claim each year.  If there is something wrong, request an appeal review, fill out the form, explain why it is wrong, substantiate your claim with your proof (divorce decree, court order, etc.) and have it corrected.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Can't help if we do not have a clue what you are talking about.|`|LXK8ktGOaa	.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Huh?|`|52efeea3c9eae1de26f16355e12a7d09aa	Possibly.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	They don't check all people.

It might just complicate their relationship. She can easily take care of her as an elder sister. Adopting her won't mean that her love for her sister will increase somehow and if she thinks that it will prove something to others...she needs to realize that there is no need to prove anything to anybody. Until she is clear about her position, there is no problem as it is.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Actually, she is the only surviving relative, is financially stable and can prove it. She shouldn't have to do anything. If she has to, she can go to the courthouse and file to become her legal guardian until her sister turns 18.   She will probably have to make some calls to find out where she needs to file this paperwork.|`|AA12398373	I am not sure that it would be necessary to adopt her sister.

xoXkHOVsaa	You answered your own question.  He thinks you are smothering him, so show him you can change by leaving him alone.  Wait at least a week, if he doesn't call you first then it would be appropriate to talk to him casually.    If he wants to be with someone else that's his choice.  You can't force him to love you.

His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them..    He waits for you. He looks out for you.       He laughs at your jokes and like listen to you.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.       He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.       He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy.       His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.       He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast.    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.

Thats her issue, not yours. How bout you dont go out buying fish and chips all the time and get some salad for you to share.

They are tough|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Tell her exactly what you put here.

She hasn't made any effort to get a job, help around the house, stay in shape, anything. And that she isn't the person you first fell for, and the person you no longer want to share your life with. That you will be graduating soon, and have a lot going for you. It still is going to be hard for her, but you have to do what it is best for you, and what makes you happy.

STBU!!!!!|`|rzVkvzu5aa	ur gonna break up with her because she's fat?! Well FYI you'll probably will never get a supermodel!    Really want advice? Tell her she's fat! Why shouldn't she know what you're thinking?|`|Avbh2QEeaa	the whole weight thing....she can lose it. Besides, looks don't last forever. Did u expect her to look like that at 50? think about that when u find a new gf.  Anyway, instead of breaking up with her why don't u try talking to her first about everything thats bothering you?? You should probably give that a try. If u don't want that then all u can do is be honest, but at the same time don't be all rude, try n be nice.      If i had a boyfriend who didnt wanna help around with cooking and cleaning i would of probably left u a long time ago. Can't see why she hasn't. Don't expect her to do EVERYTHING for you, you have to share responsibilities as well. thats life!|`|AA12004236	Have you talked to her about these issues? Because if you bring them up several times then she will get the hint that's she too lazy. If she still doesn't get the hint, just let her know it's unattractive that she's behaving like that. If she still doesn't change just let her know that you would like to move on and she will know that it's because of what she did or didn't do in this case.    p.s. so what if she gained weight..if u loved her, appearance would only be a small part of the whole package.    Good Luck
T3b4I4kXaa	You give her until "___ date" to pack up and get out. Tell her that if she is not out by that date you will have her forcibly evicted. Remind her often. Bring home boxes for her to pack her stuff.    The way you forcibly evict someone is you go down to the county courthouse and file for the eviction. In Houston it costs $50. On the appointed day, you stay home and be ready to help the deputy remove her. Take her key to the apartment or have a locksmith ready to remaster the locks.|`|6G973YWvaa	What I want you to do is make her drunk and give her the last BANG! lol and then tie her legs with a rope and in the other end, tie some heavy objects most likely a television.

It makes people desperate.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Who told you life was fair?    Its not.  All of us sometimes have to do what we must in order to survive, or ensure the survival of the ones we love.      Unless you are in this situation, then you have no experience to judge others with.      Its easy to sit back and pontificate about what we see as right or wrong in the world.  The fact is, most of us are ill equipped to understand why the world is as it is, or why people must do what they must do.    Worry about what you can control, your own life and standards.  If you want a better world, live a good life and try to be a help and not a hindrance to your fellow men and women.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think they'll earn it.|`|GXM74MGPaa	People do what they need to do.

Or they're raised to understand that their only worth is to be sold in order to help their family. They see it as a duty. Because I'm sure most of them would rather not marry a foreigner they've never met. This is a lot different from Western women who marry solely for money: the cars, the house, the plastic surgery, credit cards, etc.|`|AA10211580	i don't judge people because it's their lives. i am indifferent about it. i know marrying for money isn't illegal and the rich guy and the goldigger benefit each other. look at hugh hefner. he can have more than 1 girlfriend living with him and they are all young in their 20s and 30s and he's 80 someting year old.|`|VTw6E9gUaa	Poverty makes people do lots of things because they are vulnerable with anything they can get easily. Usually they marry but get treated badly and disrepect.|`|WzY2WhGhaa	I think it continued to perpetuate many of the archaic and backwards ideas/laws many countries have towards women. There are so many places where instead of allowing and encouraging women to get an education--which we all know you earn tens of thousands easily just by getting a bachelor's-- attitudes of the culture teach these women that marrying a foreigner to help your family situation is one of the only ways. If it's not that, then it's turning to prostitution which really just hurts everyone in the end.    I'm not sure it's a matter of fairness, but more about whether or not this shows justice towards women. We may not see their reasoning as fair or valid, but in their situations, they do. I've met many people from India where they feel that having an arranged marriage is their only choice, and while there isn't really anything inherently wrong with arranged marriage, it needs to be what YOU as a person wants to do. That's not really the case with alot of those situations. No matter what we think, their reasoning will always be valid and fair to them.    I think the men in these situations need to truly understand what they are getting themselves into. It doesn't always work out for both parties. I once knew a guy who stayed very far away from foreign women because of all the horror stories he heard. For example, he told me that many women from Russia will use American men as a means to get into the U.S, and once they are here will ditch that guy and look for Russian men instead. The American guy was just their stepping stone here. Granted, there are probably just as many men who take advantage of the situation as well-- but keep in mind there are also many men who really want to get married for the right reasons and do love their wives.    It's a very complicated and sad situation for everyone involved, and I think the best thing we can do is try to advocate education and social justice instead of passing judgment.|`|lvelp0CGaa	I dont .    Stay out of other countries politics where marriage is concerned it will just give you heart burn .    The only good thing out of these arrangement's is 4 out of 10 % that marry do actually form a respect and some time's even fall in love with the man chosen for them so they dont suffer as badly as the girl's who follow their families wishes and are stuck with some sleaze bag for a life time until death , it isnt fair but we arent allowed to judge we are only allowed to discuss and it doesnt change anybody's fate . Realistically they do it for honour and pride of their family not just the money or cattle or what ever the gain and their children are raised blessed and loved and respected so it should even out on some level .    Seriously people of the western world divorce so often , it is not this way for many countries unlike the above replier divorce is not an option death is the only way out of a nightmare wrong match so you cant just brush it off that way for their suffering .    The women who marry for money in our society need us ladies who marry for love to teach them a harsh lesson and teach them some self respect by using them as house maids and baby sitter's , cook's so on and so forth show them their own worth for their stupidity and childishness to grab something that daddy leaving them stole from them emotionally .|`|PHYj1UPwaa	My EX husband moved to Asia and married a very young girl..He is turning 62 and she is under 30..They have been married now about 7 years and they have 2 daughters, very young girls..I was married to him for almost 20 years..I know in our relationship he was very abusive..hot tempered..hid money...had secret girlfriends and secret Bank accounts...He would disappear for days at a time and come home whenever he was ready, acting like nothing was unusual....Just think, she is walking in my shoes, now...|`|bWMBuNiMaa	if its for saving a family i think its alright...|`|OuHwFJzVaa	I think it is very sad that they marry somebody for the money.

I dont know...its a touchy subject for some.|`|TfOfVRYnaa	Smart girls right there. Marriage, legally, actually means "Sharing of property" So I'd rather share my property with someone who had money, instead of a hobo.|`|BQqMg1A1aa	marriage usually is only for love in my eyes, but if a man or woman marries to save the other i thinks that beautiful in a sense if they love each other, even if they just recently met. life isnt fair and neither is our government.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	First of all, I think it would be important to establish what is meant by 'young', and also what you mean by 'foreigners' (I presume you mean 'people not from your country', in which case that means that you mean anybody from approximately 200 countries, there is more than one developed nation on this planet)? In most societies, the age of consent is generally 18+ (16 with parental consent), so one would normally conclude that the 'girl' in question would be reasonably aware of what they are entering into, so 'taking advantage' doesn't really seem to come into it. If both parties are aware that the marriage is largely based on the alleviation of poverty before proceeding then I don't really see the problem. It's important to consider that morals and values are relative, what you may consider to be 'valid and acceptable' perhaps would not corroborate with the society that said woman comes from. Finally, there are plenty of marriages which don't involve 'foreigners' which are quite obviously financially motivated.
Z4PxfObXaa	See a marriage counselor.  And since you said you are religious, make sure it is a religious counselor.  They will give the advice that goes along with what you believe and hopefully have the same foundations you are looking for.  I'm not married or anything, so I do not know what you are going through, but I believe you guys can fix this.  Just keep praying about it and talk to each other about it.  It will only work if you both make an effort.|`|rcut6bhoaa	I would advise the opposite of some of the above.  When he is sleeping alot, that is a sign of depression.      I would suggest no sex, no romance.  I think what he is looking for is just for you to be a friend to him.  Really, isn't that is what the relationship is based on? ( at least a major part of it should be).  Try to get closer to him on a friendship base and see if you cant get him to open up that way.      Good Luck|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If he is willing then give marriage counseling a try.|`|GXM74MGPaa	i know this is silly. but sex fixes alot of things. try having more.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Second honeymoons sometimes help to relight the spark|`|SiSplXXsaa	Talk to a professional, perhaps a religious leader if that's an important aspect of your life, and try to work out what your problems are at the root and how to fix them all bit by bit.    Also, if your husband is constantly tired, this may be the sign of a medical problem, so perhaps you should suggest he see a doctor.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	if all he wants to do is sleep then he may very well be suffering from depression.  talk to your doctor about it.  not knowing what your past is its difficult for us to offer much help but i know this, if you have children you may be doing what many parents do and that is look at your husband as 'daddy' and he is looking at you as 'mummy'.  its sometimes difficult to remember that your spouse isn't just the father/mother of your children.  we have to make a conscious effort to look at him/her as your lover, your friend, your confidant.  sometimes we tend to take each other for granted without really thinking about it.  try setting up a romantic evening at home and see if that helps - it doesn't have to be all roses and candlelight - sometimes a simple dinner and snuggling up on the sofa to watch a good movie works wonders.   i hope that you two can work out whatever your issues are, wishing you the very best...............|`|XuG5g9Zgaa	Consider counseling.  You both are motivated to make it work but something is wrong.  Get help and save what you have.    Good luck.|`|AA12025153	Well, all I can say is have faith and hope he does too..  If things are not better soon and neither partner is happy, maybe it is time to call it off and seperate..Maybe you didnt find your soul mate?  I know many couple that have tried counseling..if there is no spark and he is not the match to your soul, no amount of counseling will work. My older sister had to pay a marrriage counselor for 6 years and guess what, it didnt work..both parties have to have a deep desire for it to work.  I would save the money , get a makeover, and find a guy who has the same likes and is good hearted to you - at all times|`|IaK4SRHpaa	It sounds like your husband might be depressed a little because you said he just seems to want to sleep.  When people sleep a lot, that's usually a sign of depression.  He could just be depressed about something and I don't think its related to you.    Try talking to him and getting him to open up about what's been bothering him lately.  That way maybe you could get him to talk about what's on his mind.  Maybe you might start off the conversation by telling him some things that are troubling you.  Then ask him if he feels the same way sometimes.    Also, I agree with everyone here that some sort of counseling would help too.  If not for the both of you then maybe just your husband.  Try both individual and marriage counseling and see if that doesn't help.    I hope this helped you a little and that people here can give you some good suggestions.  It sounds like you two both still really care about each other and it does seem like you talk to each other still which is the most important thing.  I wish you both well.|`|sKHKi0Q9aa	ask him to remember why he fell in love with you?  remember all the great moments that you two have shared ?  communciation is the key to a strong relationship  start a chanel of open conversation...ask him how he feels     if you like reading books here is a good one    http://tinyurl.com/b6npg3    tips on better communication in relationships    hope it helps|`|3MKHCgE3aa	Start by remembering what it was that brought you togethr in the first place. maybe some of the old memories will re kindle some of the spark.  try having a date night.  You don't list what things came your way, but maybe it's something that has him depressed (his constant sleeping).  See if you can get him to see a professional (you too).|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	You both have to be ready to let go of the past. If things haven't changed that means that you both are still not letting go. You both need to make the active effort to change, maybe step outside your comfort levels and start enjoying life together. You only have this one life to live, if you waste time holding resentment and not trying to work through things then nothing will change. It seems because of religion you don't wish to separate, so you guys should try to maybe going at it together as a team, as isn't that what marriage provides us? A team, someone you can count on, rely on, and trust; and the same for them from you in return. So many people get divorces because they just haven't slowed down and realized, "hey, we still love each other, despite that we argue". Every couple will argue, there is no perfect couple. I know it may sound silly to you, but if you go and do an astrology search of you and your husband's zodiacs, you can discover alot about how your relationship can be in general working terms. (For my partner and I, she's a leo and I'm a virgo, and as signs go, we are supposed to be lava together, we are to have a very strong bond, but we have a very strong passion to fight as well, both hot headed and can sometimes not see the others view; which is totally true of our relationship, now that I know, I have started to learn the tools to cope with arguments and how to get through the past)    If you need to, then try a relationship therapist, they can be helpful if you both are unsure of where to start. I'd have a consult with a therapist and let them know that you both want to work through this, but are unsure of where to start. You want to find one that will be proactive to helping you and just not lead you in circles of discussing forever. You need to gain tools to use in your relationship.    Good luck to you in reconciling with him.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Communication is the key you have to talk about what is going on in his head and you have to tell him what is going on in yours. My husband and I were in a serious car accident and we went from being an upper middle class family to a couple of busted and broke folks, we couldn't work for nealy three years and the stress coupled with being totally broke took a tole on us. He turned to drugs and had a motorcycle accident and everyone was amazed that we managed to become closer and this is how we did it. We went to the beach for a weekend and stayed in a beautiful hotel room with our last three hundred dollars in the world. We talked and cried and clung to each other, we shared our fears and figured out what we were going to do. Before we left for the beach we each wrote down 10 bad things and 10 good things and five solutions and we brought them with us. The first thing we did when we got there was to read each others papers. I was amazed at what his said it was totally different than what I thought he thought and he said mine was the opposite of what he thought I was thinking. It was a jumping off point for us to finally fully understand what each other was going through. If the love is there you will make it through if you can just talk through everything and come up with a plan for your future. It sounds like your husband is depressed and it might take some doing to get him motivated and involved but if he loves you you will be able to get him going. Good luck!|`|FODZBCtraa	seek other people|`|DuSFKygEaa	Tear him a new one in the bedroom.|`|gtAb94d2aa	The best suggestion I can give you is marriage counseling. I know it seems a little drastic, but I know so many couples who have benefited from it. If your husband doesn't feel as pro-counseling as you may at first, go on your own. Talk to the counselor and get some advice on what you can do. They have worked through many of these situations before, so no need to worry. If you still have love for him, and he still has love for you, I guarantee you everything will work out. The rough patch with become smooth.

My suggestion to you would be to get a hobby and do for yourself. It helps believe me. Then you need to sit and have a looong talk or many talks. Honesty and open discussions are the  1 way to work through it. Last but not least, you may need someone to step in like a councilor or something. Sometimes they will give you a different perspective on things and get to the root of really what's wrong. It really helps if your friends first with you hubby. Remind him that your there for him and you two can work through this together. Sometimes time apart helps too. It really takes Two to make a marriage work. Cooking dinner together is a great together time, and sparks can fly. Add some wine to the mix. Go to the movies or dancing. Spend some quality time together. Be creative and adventurous. :) Hope this helps some.|`|wcYRxDw2aa	Maybe you should try moving to a different state. I think that a new place nothing from your past and just the two of you will help the both of you to realize just how much you mean to each other.  Maybe you can try to do more things together that you both enjoy things that have to be done together, where you need each other there for support. Like wall climbing or something that you both enjoy.  Sit down with a good movie that may get you in both in the mood.  Maybe a good therapist will do the trick there could be something else that is going on with him emotionally and he needs to work through that at the same time.  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	www.fireproofmymarriage.com    Start there, and pray|`|MejGuWr0aa	I do not know your situation, nor will I pretend to utterly understand it. But I can give you this advice from my experience on how to 'make up' for things and how to bring some romance back: You know what he likes right? Buy him little thoughtful gifts, nothing to big just something to show that you care. Cuddling is always a winner with me and by boyfriend, but not all guys are into that I hear.     Sex is another route to go with it. Rose petals spread lightly around the bed (and maybe on you) while you are naked is a very artistic way to say 'I love you' using sex as part of it. I did that for Valentines' Day with my boyfriend. He loved it. :)    Talking with him and being honest about your feelings on the situation is a good thing. But don't just say what you want to say and expect everything to fall into place. You have to let him speak up and try, try very hard, to understand where HE is coming from.     Apologies for not having insight into this situation. Hopefully you can get something out of this message. Good luck with you and your husband.|`|eMwZPwRAaa	He may be clinically depressed.

Otherwise it's just a code among women, you don't mess with married men.|`|LC8iYnncaa	if you're married yes... hes married so of course he is|`|UZxeBrxQaa	The problem is you are causing him to entertain thoughts any normal man would have if an attractive woman "flirts" with him.  He automatically interprets your moves as being interested in him.    You are causing him difficulty.  Why do that for your own entertainment?|`|Dym1Xfquaa	that i guess is the grey area, but keep doing it and maybe you might get results you don't want|`|5oj5YfKMaa	Jesus says that if one looks at another with lust that they have committed adultery in there heart. It's a sad fact but if I'm being totally truthful I have looked at other women lustfully and I am married and although you may think it's innocent flirting know that at some time that married man has thought about cheating on his wife with you and that is adultery as I explained above.|`|RnJwKF97aa	i dont know, but dont think because he is married he won't wont to wander.  playing with fire|`|WzY2WhGhaa	No, it's not adultery, but you are playing with hot water. What I don't understand is what is your reasoning behind flirting with a married man when you have just said it won't go anywhere? Are you doing this in the hopes that you *might* go further? What I'm confused about is why tease and tempt yourself when nothing will happen?|`|OfYRmdQOaa	well the bible says it is but if i were you i would stop doing that **** cause if his  wife found out she might take the **** out of you truth me that already happened to me but the good thing was that i won but latter i felt bad because i knew she was right and she actually divorced and move away cause of me and now i don't even wanna see that guy|`|1kfeghDDaa	No, but you are asking for trouble. How 'bout someone flirt with your man??
KSq8DXlfaa	This is going to sound awful, but his finding out it was you could actually be turned into a good thing. And the best idea is for you to do just that, as you can't make him unlearn who the note was from!:/ You need to work on getting to become his gf(if that's what you want) now that the first step-telling him how you feel- has been done for you. Try talking to him some if you have the nerve, or wait a couple days if you need to. Don't worry about many other people finding out-your crush will be more embarrassed than you are and won't want anyone to know either. He may like you back:) which is why him getting that note was actually good. If you don't want to go any farther with him, then just ignore what happened completely-easier said than done, but possible. If people do find out about/ask you about the note, give them a wtf are u talking about face or laugh it off. But the best idea is, if you can stand it and if there's ANY chance of him liking you back(aka if he's not homosexual or already has a gf which I assume he doesn't!) then flirt or try to get closer with him. Sorry this advice sounds awful, but please give it a try!:) If you want, u can edit ur question and I'll try to give u a better answer, as I know this one sucked.:S|`|mzYsk112aa	How would he be your valentine without knowing who you are?  Didn't think it through, did ya?|`|pORmp0tfaa	obviously he's going to try to figure out who it was. if you didn't want him to know you shouldn't have send him a valentine silly. but if you're really going to chicken out, just tell him you meant it as a joke.|`|2F4vkfnxaa	why not? hes ur crush and if u like him, shouldnt u be willing to take the risk?|`|CqldGgFCaa	if you dont want him to know just act like it wasnt you an dkinda make jokes about it|`|TwWuCGUEaa	if you like the kid just tell him   there is no need to get scared|`|02CeuJtCaa	well, you should admit that you wrote it.  if not, you'll never know if he likes you or not.  it might be kinda scary but its better to tell him or you'll regret not telling him that you like him if he gets a gf or something|`|Mv51CBoNaa	bahah just act completely clueless.. be like what? i dont know what your talking about. and walk away. end of story.     xDD|`|a3f78ba390310d91be76895fb8126262aa	Consider sending him a signed valentine and following it up with a statement that you have sent him the valentine you signed. And mention you have sent only one. Also, send similar, signed valentines to some of his friends and acquaintances that you know. The idea is you have sent many valentines to many guys, none of which mean that much to you. That should disguise the unsigned one you sent.|`|UGtM7vD7aa	maybe it's a good thing that he knows who you are! there's nothing you can do if he already knows it's you. maybe he likes you too, you never know!|`|MXQYAUuXaa	awwww he is a big jerk...|`|0nTKqldAaa	Tell him it was u, but someone dared you to do it at a party!      It works!!!!|`|fyyzKKqpaa	if you want him to be your valentine he had to find out at some point who it was....|`|Zymxhc7Jaa	say it wasn't your handwriting, and that he should be your valentine before the other girl gets to him. the other girl is probably fat and ugly anyways, if she's sending an anonymous note. I'm telling you to say this. haha  not sure, what you should do, that's what I'd do.. But I am a guy, and you are a girl, situations are different|`|nC8GRKxhaa	Okay - First of all, The boys will probably try to tease you. Dont get defence - sometimes that makes it obvious. Just laugh at pretedn you have no idea - Don't pay too much attention to it - because if you kind of ignore it - it takes the fun of out their game. Hide things with your hand writign on them - and probably leave somethgin lying around you wrote in a different style writing. Don't worry - just laugh it off - this boy is a bully. Love and Hapiness :)|`|JeNN7ZNqaa	shoulda typed it sucks for u|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Ew Mah Gawd!  Ew Mah Gawd!  Ew Mah Gawd!

0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	guy 1 noooooo.... like you have no good reasons at all other than the fact that no one else might ask you. if you want guy 3 you are gonna have to ask him yourself, but guy 2 sounds like a good plan.|`|Tq2ecVxNaa	Well, Guy 1 sounds like he has always kinda been there for you, you could tell him that if you each can't find a date then you will go with him. That way you will have a date for sure.    Guy 2 sounds sweet and you like him, so if he asks you then you might say yes, I guess thats just your choice.    Guy 3 sounds like your ultimate prom date, but you shouldn't wait around for him forever, so find out if he has a date and hint to him about prom.|`|FSVG2Wlmaa	umm wow that was kinda confusing.  if u dont want to go w/ guy1 then just tell him no.  if u rlly wanna go w/ guy 2 then just do it.  if guy 3 is not gonna ask u, dont even bothr worrying bout him.  hope i helped!!!|`|BkyUxlwaaa	i think your best bet is to go ask No. 3 if he has anyone to take, blokes like a girl that takes matters into her hands, it might work out good for you, if he turns you down then just wait and see if No.2 asks,     by the sounds of it No.1 is a no go, if you go with him and he does have a crush then he will always think he has a chance with you and will never leave you alone and will ask you for dates etc.. at every possible moment. explain in a nice way that you are friends and you wouldnt like to give him and others the wrong impression , if he is a true friend he will understand. but i truely think you shouldnt take him even if your dateless.     good luck and i hope you meet the man of your dreams and have a very good time.    regards  michael

Just be a gentleman. That sounds really corny but that's what girls like. That's what I like, anyway. Tell her she's pretty, don't tell her she's hot. If she's a normal human being, she'll love that. All girls want is a little attention sometimes.|`|T7z68YDTaa	i guess u can try talking to girls at school (IF u go to school) or u can do that eharmony.com thing|`|02CeuJtCaa	get to know her. talk to her, initiate some conversation.  start with talking about school topics, about the class. then get into what she likes and what you like.  share some interests.|`|zjp17TZcaa	MAN UP! stop wasting your time looking for answers on yahoo or google! go over to her and talk to her.  you aint going to find her on the internet unless you are myspace or facebook stalking her.  but while you doing that other guys are talking to her.... so....

Don't seem like you're trying to hard to get her attention. Maybe just "happen" to be next to her in a line for something and start a casual conversation,but let her come to you. Coming on too strong and trying too hard are usually both turn offs. Just be yourself!|`|J3W93q55aa	open your mouth,|`|TwWuCGUEaa	go up to her and introduce urself as a friend first then take it to the next level which is a date|`|bySORZZjaa	1. introduce yourself. you wont die.. lol  2. when you see her in the hall or wherever.. say hey. at first you should try to let her get to know you. give her some time and also do not rush into things!!   good luck|`|sLzbX9FJaa	A classic:    get your friend to say/do something mean to her, then defend her and tell your friend off.Then maybe next time it can be your friend's turn. :D
3ctchU2faa	Speak to your mom about living with your step dad. He signed your birth certificate, so I believe that gives him some parental rights even though he is not your biological dad. And if he adopted you, then he has even more.  Best to ask your mom about it, or a counselor that can help you/your mom/her boyfriend stop butting heads.|`|bWGgFuxVaa	yea|`|myhR1BpMaa	Yes he's your legal guardian right.|`|8NO8f2ffaa	yes i think|`|C5UUltHtaa	Yes; Have a good trip to Georgia.|`|AA10327722	Each state has different rules but in most states you get to choose which parent you want to live with when your 16.  Considering he signed your birth certificate that means basically he's your dad.  So yes you can live with him.  Just tell your mom you need a break from everything thats going on there and wanna go visit him for a while.  You don't have to come back if you don't want to.|`|FUdBUQtRaa	well if you grew up with him, than hes your dad, no matter if hes blood related to you or not.|`|QToBEufnaa	Depends on how old you are. If you're above 14 you can live with whoever you want, if not court decides, but they'll probably let you live with who you want to live with.|`|jlTANWWdaa	Each state is different but I would think you are right.  Try talking to mom.  Maybe a school counselor or if all else fails try your Pastor.  If none of the above work there are people called Advocates for minors.  That's bout all I can suggest.  Good Luck|`|Rg71zzjDaa	Step Dads are not legal gaurdians. They have no legal responsibility for their step daughters. If the biological Dad dies, the biological Mom has full legal responsibility. This does not mean agreements cannot be made among all  parties concerned.|`|8TublJMCaa	if your father is loving and polite to you and he souds like that from what you told, i think you should move in with him, instead of living with your mom when you are distressed living with her and her boyfriend.
QXY34a7Laa	West, or maybe east.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	It depends on a lot of things....what state you are in (each state has different filing costs), whether its a contested or uncontested divorce (uncontested divorces do not need lawyers and you can do the divorce yourself, contested require a lawyer to get them finalized)|`|mb2Otvunaa	ALMOAST AS MUCH AS HOOKED ON PHONICS|`|y8mRKy2vaa	COST ME $1,459.....VERY WORTH IT!!!|`|Dym1Xfquaa	depends on many factors:   1* is it being contested,   2* is their property  3* are there children between you guys  4* the state in which you live  5* the lawyer you use (there are free lawyers depending on you income)  all of htese factors add to the cost,|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Hit the bookstore and pick up the latest do-it-yourself divorce guide for your state. Some editions have all the forms on a CD inside the jacket.  It is a very short and empowering read.  You can generally get free for less than $400 and in less than 60 days.  You can make it cheaper by getting the spouse to sign the papers rather than having to be served.  Start collecting all financial statements... assets as well as debts.|`|TfOfVRYnaa	Way more than you can afford. Work it out.|`|pCyyjeAwaa	You  must really be mad.  You don't want to talk about what the other person done to you to make you want a divorce.  And then you spelled cost wrong|`|fbb6d7586e3c67daefbd6389c5237bffaa	well you certainly have to be smart enough to spell "cost" in order to have enough money.|`|YEH88J4kaa	Financial Price? $300 if it's uncontested. Sky's the limit if it's ugly.  Intangible Price? With all the emotional and psychological distress? Shave a few years off your lifespan. Good news? High probability that if it's gotten to this point, once it's all said and done, you'll be much better off. Good luck!|`|RnJwKF97aa	too much, depending on which side of the divorce you are on and how much you had before you were married.  its always ugly
bVQJAS22aa	The thing is, don't tell her that you like her just yet. Play it cool. Treat her like a queen sort of. Don't make a fool of your self though. After you finally feel comfortable, let her know how you feel. Just what ever you do, don't get jealous. Chances are, it will show. Hope I helped!|`|th4eHIrTaa	Tell her you like her and see how she takes it..|`|wLWgCRFcaa	Instead of making references to violence and jealousy, how about asking her out?|`|o1B8obliaa	you've hung out with this girl for 5 years and you haven't even attempted first base? pff, loser; you're outta your mind and should give up; get a hooker.
pSy88C9paa	There are free hotlines they can call and should call.  google "teen hotline" and you should be able to find many resources.  You can also call a local hospital and they have those references/phone numbers too.  Also, tell an adult. this is very important.  Talk with your parents or school counselor...or another adult you trust.  Your friends both need help before they seriously harm themselves.  I'd hate to see something happen to them.  Especially when there is help...  good luck!!|`|wLWgCRFcaa	This is a complex question and the solution is probably beyond your scope of expertise.    Here is a link:  http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_mind/men...  People who cut need help, but they have to figure it out themselves.  Cutting is not life-threatening.  Be supportive of your friends, don't panic and dump them, and don't try to tell your friends what to do.|`|n4QSgd7caa	well most people like that are depressed or just loving the pain...for some people it's normal...but try to say your worried about why she does that and so on.....|`|pbHMSTbQaa	well obviously their trying to get attention.  just like tell her quit, and she needs help. cuz if she doesnt, then she may poissably kill her self.  or  u no thinking about it if she really hated her life, wouldnt she have killed her self a long time ago??  so she just wants attention basically.|`|tsPcAZ2haa	TALK TO THEM WHENEVER THEY'RE DEPRESSED TELL THEM SELF MUTILATION IS NOT THE ANSWER THUS TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS TELL THEM YOU ARE THERE FOR THEM THA YOU REALLY LOVE THEM

A real Dad works 60 hours a week and spends his evenings listening to his wife unload about her rough day, then spends his weekends working in the yard, drinking beer and watching sports. Throw in a little harping at the kids for giving their mother a hard time during the work week. A fantasy Dad works about 20 hours a week, mostly from home, and is the coach of every sport you'll ever want to play. He never yells, teaches you how to fly fish, and plays guitar on a porch swing. And all the other moms think he's sexy, and this doesn't bother your mom a bit.     So the difference is, really: no one to do the yard work.|`|u5CToCFBaa	well my dad has always been in and out of my life for 17 years and its sort of confusing. he was real into drugs and at that time i woulde rather not had a dad at all. but now he is drug free, a christian man and finally got his own house. he still has a lot of growing up to do but now i couldnt live a day without him. =]
3ctchU2faa	Sit him down for a final chat about the convention. Explain that you are very sorry about talking back to him, and that you understand that it was disrespectful and you will try to not do it again.  Tell him you've been looking forward to this convention for a long time and you would really appreciate if he let you go.  If he still says no, than you're going to have to except it. He is your dad, and maybe he'll let you go the next time around.
0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Move. Don't even tell him you're moving. If he hasn't bothered to establish paternity, ignores your e-mails and hasn't provided anything for her, just go. It's none of his business and I would like to see his case for "not allowing" you to move. Good luck.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	I am quite sure you won't have any problems. Just to be really sure you should contact a lawyer.|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	If he has not established paternity then he is by law not the father, so move.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You answered your own question. The baby's father doesn't want anything to do with the kid. He is all talk.    Make sure you have the father's address and know where he works before you move to be with your parents. Then use his contact info to file for child support from the father... they can garnish his wages before he gets paid.    Hawaii is expensive. You and the kid need the money. He owes you for back child support.|`|yptfd3sIaa	OK, first of all - you can move because paternity has not been established and he has no legal right to stop you. It does not sound like you want to deny him paternity, though. It sounds like you want him to step up. If you want to see if he cares at all, tell him about your family's plans. He'll either wish you bon voyage or buy you a ring. Just don't hold your breath... or be too sad when he lets you, and his baby, go.
H5uDrIagaa	No, you don't need those items for a wedding to be legal.  You can go to the courthouse without those things, get married by a justice of the peace and save yourself a lot of money.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	The only things you need to make your wedding legal are the couple, your officiant, your marriage license, and your witnesses (Your witnesses must sign the license as well)    Unity candles are part of a religious ceremony, not legal (Traditionally Catholic, though many other couples choose to use them.)  The ring pillows are only used if you have a ring bearer in your ceremony, but not all weddings do and it isn't necessary.  A garter is only necessary if you plan on doing a garter toss at your reception, even if not some brides may choose to wear one anyway just to have as a small keepsake.  All the decor, and ceremony isn't really needed for it to be legal.    If you are having a civil (Non-religious) ceremony outside of a courthouse, though, you can include whatever you want to in your ceremony.  Courthouse civil ceremonies are relatively simple, but get you married just as well as any other.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Your wedding day is about what you and your fiance want. If those things are important to you, go for it. But it doesn't make it any more valid legally. You just need you, your honey, your marriage license, and witnesses. Good luck!|`|y6gVmhHxaa	As opposed to an illegal wedding?  Are you talking about a civil ceremony?  You don't need any of those things to make it legal.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	I say your wedding is exactly that..."your wedding"  Why buy a bunch of stuff you don't want to buy just to make it traditional? I don't even think people notice those things anyway. The only one they would maybe is the garter because the garter toss is always fun.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	all you need is a Magistrate and marriage licence|`|AA12004880	The only thing you need to make a wedding "legal" is papers from a court house.     A wedding is all your choice. Everything in it is your choice. People have crazy weddings that are off kilter from the traditional ALL the time.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	A legal wedding requires a bride, a groom and an officiate.  That's it.
n7bok7NRaa	Keep silent about your decision to move on, and act friendly until you find a new job. Then call it quits when you move on.    Since she isn't even discussing with you what her issues are without running off to a VP, she's clearly not trusting you - and really, a person like that isn't worth having around, and clearly doesn't value you as a friend.|`|pSy88C9paa	Ever heard the phrase:   "keep your friends close and your enemies closer"?  This is your motto.  But do not tell her you are getting another job, and when you get the other job do not tell her where you work.  Once you give notice (or dont show up to current job anymore)  make the cut.  Ice cold.  you are right, if you dont have a loyal friend, you dont have a real friend.  Period.  good luck|`|jz3S68IGaa	If it were me, I'd dump her. No matter where you go in life or how old you become, you always will find new friends. To me, that thought makes life more interesting.|`|ciDR2kpTaa	Seems like shes not a friend after all. Friends don't betray friends so before you actually get fired you need to find another job and leave her alone. On top of that if you are in a position of leadership and she isn't this can also have a big impact on why she wants to get you fired. Envy.   GET RID OF HER TRIFLING AZZ!!
f8CN2qIvaa	Stop comparing yourself and your life to hers.  She gets everything handed to her--you work for what you have, and your parents have instilled you with a work ethic.  Though you still care for your ex, and though she may be a fine person, it could be time to move on to someone who shares your views, and who does not make you feel out of your league.  This whole issue is dragging you down and depressing you to the point where your marks and your health (physical and mental) is suffering.  It's time for a change.  Get rid of that burden that really isn't yours to carry.|`|7EgQmKTlaa	First....You are very blessed..Wake up, Look around, appreciate the things you do have in your life. There are many worst things than this that can happen. If you put your faith in God, then you have to understand that maybe this is for the best.    Second....Stay away...Don't subject yourself to anymore pain..Give yourself some time alone.     Third..True Love doesn't know color or leagues...When it happens, you will understand that it is really blind, Just like everyone says it is...    Remember that Happiness is always a Inside Job..

Sounds a bit like hes clingy so maybe its hard for her to get rid of him. i was in a bad relationship before and if he wasnt flippin out i was happy for a while which is maybe why she seems the same.  from what she said on the phone sounds like she may well feel the same for u so just try to be brave and focus on furthering ur own relationship x|`|02CeuJtCaa	hm...the relationship is really complicated. its really hard to say who she really likes.  btw, are you guys dating or not? its hard to tell.    but it doesn't seem like she cares much about your relationship with her.  she may try to be nice about it but she doesn't seem to notice you much or pay much attention to you.    as for the other guy, she could still see him as just a friend.  and as for a long friend relationship, she still cheerishes it.    anyhow, i think you should talk it out with her.|`|mORoRJuraa	Well, get down to the main business... ask her if she is dating the guy and if she wanted to date you instead. Tell her if u feel comfortable or not with the idea of her being friends with the other guy or her being friends with him at all/ period. So, try not to get too shy. Because sex WILL happen to u someday... XD No, just kidding. Seriously, don't get too shy, because then she will wonder if there is something wrong with her and then she might start doubting herself and will likely get lower self- esteem. She will wonder, If you love her, then why do you act so shy and nervous around her?  Ask her about this guy. Ask her if she loves you. Ask her if she REALLY loves you. Ask her if she wants to start dating. There has to be some closure between u 2. It might help to talk to the guy she's always with, too. Ask him if they're dating. Ask him if he loves her. Ask him if he's aware hat you would like to have a relationship, be friends, or even possibly DATE her. Hang out with her more more often and try to get more intimate with her and she will start to feel comfortable and loved truly by at lease one guy besides her father... not much of a joke or ever meant to be... Hopeit works out and that u 2 get together! Good luck!!!!!|`|CHEJmqjDaa	Well you say that she says hi and ask's random questions. Random questions is actually good. Most likely she wants to start a conversation with you, which isn't a bad thing seeing that you like her. And she is kinda hung up on the guy i'd say. But still, think, she gives a sh*t bout trying to conversate wit you. Even she said "just talk to me me everything will be fine". Meaning........ She can still be pulled away from the other guy. She probably hangs out with him because he's around alot and talks to her cool. You should try that too. Let her see you're not that shy anymore and she'll definitely be more interested. You need to deal with the shyness. Can't help you there. That's kinda part of my problem too. DUDE IMAGINE SHE'S REAL UGLY. Everyone talks wit ugly chicks cool. Or you kno, think of the outcome.   GOOD LUCK.  Oh n i expect best answer for this.|`|WrmBpu9saa	It looks like she is hung up on hime. If in the next couple days nothing more happens I would say move on because she isnt planning on breaking off or toning down the relationship with this other guy|`|VNSERsZ1aa	BEST ANSWER GETS MAXIMUM POINTS!?    really? i tohught best answer got no points....|`|hkEJJhLbaa	It definitely doesn't sound like she likes the other guy. From what you've said it sounds like she could like you. But if you've already told her how you feel there is not much you can do but wait for her I guess.|`|vqnum8CWaa	I would personally ask her out  if you get to the 'dependent on yu being a friend' level ,then she wont date you AT ALL  you have to get her a lone, one way or another, show her its important, tell her face to face, look her in the eyes, and DO NOT stutter  girls love that, and if she turns you down, smile and say, thanks, I'm glad yo uheard me out, and walk DON'T run in a different direction than her.  if you feel like crying, take it easy in a bathroom, wipe your eyes, and keep telling yourself, its a girl, one girl, and the one that loves me is out there  if she says YES  smile and take her hands, kiss it and say, thank you  she'll swoon ;)  walk her to her next class, or something, do NOT walk off  anyway, I'm praying for you, GOOD LUCK|`|MySqexO0aa	You should definitely try and become more close. Obviously there is some jealously here and if you want the girl you have make yourself more open to her. If that works, but you have the other guy on your back have the girl tell him to back off, because the other option is fighting him and winning. (not good)|`|EMiekqB2aa	Screw her she doesnt want to get into your pants just friends not friends with benifits!|`|tu7ef6Q7aa	go for it man  she's settling for this guy because she doesn't have anything else but she's hinting at you to go for it  she wants you to take the first move  it kinda sounds like she just doesn't wanna lose this guy as a friend.  if you guys started going out you wouldn't have to worry about this guy because she would have an excuse. she has a boyfriend.  good luck|`|CGFAPKJOaa	1 key is you have to have more confidence in yourself. Confidence makes anyone irresistible.     People CAN "LIKE" more than one person. It's sort of up to you who she chooses. Apparently, she likes someone who fights for her attention. But, don't make a fool of yourself doing so.    I can't honestly say if she truly likes this guy or not, but it seems maybe she doesn't b/c she would have said something to her friends by now. HOWEVER, she does like the attention!    Show her that you like her. Give her attention. Don't just shy away. You have to break yourself of that. Practice on saying things you'd like to tell her. Write it in a letter, ask her if you can sit with you in class. If she accepts, later ask if she'd like to sit with you at lunch...    Good luck!|`|OtTOKJXGaa	Honestly, you probably dont want 2 hear this but it sounds like she likes him. She's probably the typ that likes to feel needed, and it makes her feel good when someone likes her that much. This guy has asked her out to homecoming 3x. She must feel really special. He kept trying, and girls like that. Unless you keep trying, and making it known you like her, even infront of her friends, this guy will probably get her. Don't give up. Even if she gives you a look like, "your weird" she probably secretly likes it and it might be just because its infront of her friends. Be confident. ... and just because she keeps saying hi to u and asks random questions, doesnt mean she likes u. She just wants u to like her.|`|D0SB7xdsaa	Start blowing her off. YOU ARE A MAN, and YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE. She wants to play games, you don't have time for games. Just don't sulk about it. If she says what's up, give a head nod or grunt and turn and go to class. Play it COOL.   You aren't going to marry her, so don't worry. she stops you to ask what's wrong with you. Say "nothing, i've got things going on in my life, that's all". Try your best to flirt with other girls from the volleyball, or track team, even if you think they are out of your league, its good to be extra friendly with them b/c girls get jealous. You can work your way back to her later.  A lot of girls will turn out to be kind of pretty.   She likes you cause you are nice, but probably likes the other guy more b/c she may hope that she can 'fix him' by spending time with him.  girls always like a bit of a challenge.|`|OC8YCBzSaa	wow exact same thing happened to me, except these two ppl were dating for like 2 years on and off. and then i started talking to her and got her to like me and asked her out and she said yes. i would go for it cuz girls like variety.
6BTvuPwcaa	You should always remember that friends will be there when boys walk away.  But, is she as good as a friend that she would choose you over him?  I think you should follow your heart.  If she is a true friend she won't be upset about who he decides to ask out.  After all, it is his decision.  She should be happy for you no matter what.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	Just talk to her about it and ask her not to be mad. She already knows that he likes you and that he would probably ask you out so you should just talk to her about it. And it's possible that she might still get mad, but if you really like the guy, then she will probably get over it after a while, especially if she finds someone herself.|`|n4QSgd7caa	if your friend cant accept the fact he likes you then o'well she got to move on he dont like her|`|bVQJAS22aa	Well if your friends really cared for you then they would let you decide. But in this case then talk to her about it. Ask her if she is ok. What she thinks. And why. I hope I helped!|`|Au7GEfQiaa	Okay talk to him. Telling your friends about him will get you nowhere, and most likely it will make your other friend incrediably jealous which i never good.
MLFBsZnUaa	Well, if you don't think you can accept one without the another, then don't do it. He and his kids are a package deal. I myself just married my boyfriend of 3 years, and fiance for a lil over 6 months in a secret ceremony (big wedding/party is in june). He, as well, has two daughters. However, his oldest was only 5 when we started dating and the youngest wasn't born yet. I was only 18 when we started dating. I had major reservations about a relationship with him because he already had on child and another on the way. But, I truly cared for him, as he is a wonderful man. So, I started by spending time with him and his daughter and I fell in love with them both. Your fiance should have def brought them around you alot more than only a few times in a period of a year, especially if he wanted you to be a big part of his life. Also, it sounds to me that the children's mother is highly immature for egging them on the way she did. Parents who are not together should NEVER bad mouth the other parent or their significant other in front of or to the children and should definitely never encourage the children do act that way. If you really care for him and truly want to make it work, then explain to him how you feel...if your engaged then you should be able to discuss anything. Tell him you want a prolonged engagement and want to be around the kids more. They are young still. Given time, Im quite sure they will warm up to you, but you also have to be willing to give them that chance. Try to find out what they like and what they are interested in and try to do things with them. However...Do not attempt to take on a "Mommy" role, as that will only push them further away. Be their friend. Move on to more as time goes by. However, if you are too put off by them, then get out the relationship now because that's not fair to your fiance (as ultimately he will be forced to choose n if he is a good father, the choice will not be you), its not fair to the children and its not fair to you. As I said, start by talking to him. This can only be your choice, but you should fully weigh everything before you make a quick decision. Good luck and I wish you all the best!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Oh boy. There is nothing more vicious more rude more nasty or more monstrous than angry snotty young girls esp in this situation. If it was two sons I'd tell you to work through it, but given the fact they are females on the brink of being TEENAGE females, you need to stop this NOW, it will NEVER work until the daughters are well into their 20s and on their own. The mother will go after you tooth and nail and do this through her horrors AKA daughters who will make your life a living hell. He will never be able to stop it, they are his spawn and as such will always come first regardless of what he tells you...be warned, you will be living in hell if you go through with this and marry this poor soul whose ex and daughter-monsters will successfully keep any and all females away from what they all consider to be their own private property.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	i'm sorry to hear you have such issues. if mum still wants dad back then what was the reason for the divorce? that is something you should know and consider before you make any decisions.  if he was running around on her then will you trust him not to do the same to you?  if he was abusive with her then sweetie i gotta tell you they don't change and you should run now!   i don't blame you for not wanting to marry him even though you love him, in fact if it were up to me i would have to say wait until the girls and you are friends. currently they are looking at you as something else to keep their dad away from them. they are young enough to trust everything their mum tells them and will be very protective of her. and i hate to say this but you have to consider the idea that the girls will never let up, they will keep on being little brats until finally the two of you break up. if you don't rush into anything then they may very well adjust to the idea of you and dad eventually getting married. i suggest that since its only been a year you should wait.  this man has far too much baggage for you to rush into marriage.  give it some time, give the girls some time, and really think this through before you accept a ring.  good luck sweetie!|`|l43NSgHyaa	His children are part of the package.  So, in reality, if you can't accept the fact that he's a father first and your husband second, then maybe it's time to re-think the relationship.    It seems to me that you are skipping a lot of steps on your road to marriage.  His children are a big part of his life and the fact that you've only met them a few times is concerning.  If this is the man you're going to marry, then he should be making and effort to have the 4 of you spend as much quality time together as possible.  It will help the bond.    In addition, and I hate to be mean, but it's unfair to say that you "love him so, it hurts to let him go,"  yet call his two children "spoiled rotten"   Calling his kids that might as well be an insult to the way him and his ex have decided to raise their children.   So, that could be the cause of a lot of tension and those words and feelingss can (and many times do) end up backfiring.  Most of the time, a parent will pick their children over their new spouse, when the spouse starts to critcize their children.    You seriously need to sit down and talk to him about all of this.  You need to express your fears openly, calmly and without name calling.  It's unfair to blame this on two young girls, age 9 and 11.  It's not their fault their parent's relationship didn't work out and it's not fair that their parents have choicen to date and marry different people.  They are both stuck in a the middle.  So, it's just not fair to label them anything.    Talk with your boyfriend about your fears of becoming a step-mother and how you feel you have not made a good connection with his girls and you want them to be comfortable with all of this.    In the end, if you can't accept his role as a father and his children openly and without negativity, then you should be thinking about leaving the relationship.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	There just kids and they don't know you and there mom is helping anything. they are just trying to make you run which is what your fixing to do. why are you going to let another lady and 2 kids take away your man. He is yours now fight for him and deal with the kids. It's only on the weekends and that's all. maybe once the kids have time to bond with you, they will like you and y'all could all get along. Don't give up so easily if you love him you will fight and hang it out with him. If the ex is an *** be one back to her give her a taste of her own medicine eventually she will back off when she sees you aren't going anywhere.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	then just continue dating him until the girls are 18 or things change, whichever comes first.    FWIW:  as heartbreaking as it is, you are wise to consider how the girls treat you and how he raises them and how their mother impacts them as part of your decision making process to decide if you want to marry him.    go slow with him, talk to him about the girls and see if he is receptive to you spending more time with them so they can get used to you, make sure he is talking to them about you and how you are important to him and how he would like to share his life with both you and them.    I do not recommend that you marry him as long as the girls are hostile towards you.  As long as they aren't receptive to you, you're better off just dating him.    Hope things work out like you want, but if they don't, then all it means is he isn't the right person for you at this stage of your lives.|`|nFAkp9f4aa	I wouldn't get married if you are having second thoughts. What i would do is express how you feel about how his kids treat you and the way you feel that his ex still wants him.  Tell him you want more time to get to know his kids because i can tell them in your life is a big deal. Just be honest and don't rush things.|`|AA11138696	Trust your fear.  This is too much baggage for you and you would really be making a big mistake to take this on.  You love him now but can it stand this?  He does not sound very supportive of you when it comes to his kids rude behavior.  Just think this is the good part.  Girls? 9 and 11?  Oh honey let me tell you, you think its bad now, wait until they are teens.  Girl I think you need to give back that ring, put on your track shoes and run for the hills.  Your heart will heal and Mr Really Right is not that far from you.  Go find him and get your neck out of that noose.|`|F7O0nLK1aa	this is tough. if you marry him, you also take on his kids. he sounds like a good dad and i would respect him for that, but if you really dont care for kids then it will cause problems forever. you need to really think it over and decide for yourself. good luck and take your time on this one.|`|6bMqZ6kcaa	honestly,in my opinion I think you should stick it out with him. Let him know how you feel,talk things out with him and be honest. Tell him you love him but you don't want his ex-wife getting into the picture. Also maybe you should try to spend more time with him and his kids,or his kids alone,take them somewhere to have fun like Dave & Busters....get to know them and let them get to know you. The only reason their snobby is because they feel like your gonna take there daddy away from them, but let them know thats not the case, that you love their dad and you realize that they are apart of him so you love them to. Let them know that if you marry him, its going to be all four of you alot of the time.    and for his ex....she needs to just back off, whats done is done,the past is unchangeable so she needs to move, she lost out on something great obviously,so it really sucks for her      hope I helped, I gave you the best advice I have, I've never been in that situation but if I were, I'd do exactly what I said for you to do.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Kids take time to warm up to people. If you have only met them a few times maybe you should try to make it a point to be around them more. Try doing things with them and your boyfriend on the weekend that is fun so they are more likely to open up. Invite them to a movie of their choice with just the 3 of you. 9 and 11 aren't too young to Riel in yet. It is most likely the older one and the younger one follows behind. and if it is mom egging it on then just give a little extra effort to put whatever thoughts she puts in their heads out. I have 2 kids and I would never bad mouth my exes girlfriend in front of them. Kids need to make their own opinions of people up. They may find that they like hanging out with you a lot. Just don't be scared to try to get them to open up. Take them for a mani and pedi or something. Sometimes you have to make girls feel extra special for them to know you aren't the enemy! You know...you were a little girl once too. lol|`|7idLr1Rxaa	If you marry him you must always remember that his children come first. You cannot be the  1 women in his life because he has 2 little girls. You also must realize that he still needs to have a cooperative relationship with their mother. Blended families are great if all members respect one another and don't cause drama. If you can't accept being  3 on the totem pole you shouldn't marry him.|`|AA10351134	This is a tough situation and it derails many relationships. Everyone can minimize the problem by being extremely grown-up and drawing boundaries, but no question, it's hard.    There have been some tough negotiations with me and my DH (he has three kids, I have none). I have not been thrilled with his parenting style all the time and he has not always been willing to give me input on the kids. Over time we've begun working much more closely together. After three years we are pretty much a united front.    But frankly, my DH is a saint and his girls are what anyone would call "very good kids" (mostly). There is no intentional rudeness, and the exes are usually reasonable, which helps a lot. He's also gone out of his way to create harmony between us all. Without all these factors working in your favor, it can be a long, tough, bitter haul.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I would suggest you spend more time with his girls and see if you can have a relationship with them before you consider if this is the man you want to marry.
6bMqZ6kcaa	hmm well I seen this on a youtube video of this one guy doing this stupid dance all over the world in different countries. Maybe you could go to different locations and in each location hold up a sign that ask the question will you marry me....oh and instead of it being a random location how about you do it in locations that you both love, like where your first date was, your favorite restaurant, your favorite anything really.    Thats what I would do, I think its pretty romantic and unique :) hope I helped!!!    GOOD LUCK!!|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Well, it's already rather unique.  Ummm, are you sure he's not going to think that the first proposal wasn't good enough?    Does EVERYTHING need to be videotaped??
soFPdaf9aa	Wow. A 4-year-old son at 19. I can only imagine the stress! And I can totally understand your frustration with your younger sister.    I'm only 15 myself and I think the biggest thing you can do for your sister is to sit her down. Have a calm, mature talk. Tell her what you just told us. Tell her you have your needs, your son has his needs and that while having another child in the house my be stressful for everyone, she's going to have to step up and be mature about it. Make her feel the pressure.     If she lets you down, say that to her. Say it like you mean it; "______(sister's name) you really let me down, here." and leave it at that. There's nothing worse than feeling immature and feeling the burden of letting someone you care about down. Just be honest with her. Brutally honest, if need be.    While this may not be the response you were looking for, I hope it helps you. And good luck on your sister and her issues.|`|AA11108018	Take her out back and give her few slaps tell her how is going be.

ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	Too many arguments can kill even the best of relationships. I am sure you and him and good times and that he loved you also. Sometimes love is not enough. It appears he lost hope for the relationship and is making an effort to move on. I can imagine how hurt you feel. He thinks of you too and I am sure he misses you, but he lost hope of you and him being able to get along and be happy. You never know if throughout time he will come to try again and call you. After all 7 years is a long time and no one can just turn off love like you can turn off water from a faucet. In the mean time stay busy and meet new people. It is not easy to get over the hurt and pain but eventually you will.  Good luck to you!|`|MvQui0rvaa	there are other fish in the sea.  move on.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	You only miss him because you are not currently in a relationship.  You remember only the good times and not the fact that he he has treated you like sh**.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u must find something or someone else in life to fill that void. i find that things happen for a reason we can't always see, or understand. its best to begin it with acceptance, therapy can also help, plus prayer. u can't keep focusing on something that is over with, or u will remain stuck in the past. the past is done and gone and rarely comes back. so your wasting your life crying over something that's been over with years now.your letting this incident control things, and we are all responsible for our emotions. sometimes people are gone from out lives because they would just continue to break our hearts, and its not about the hurt, its all about how u handle it. why waste time and energy on the past, its just damaging u. he is long gone, and after this many years, u may need some therapy so u can move on.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	You were in love with him. It's not easy getting over someone you love. You should try and start dating again. Do not, I repeat do not start talking about your ex boyfriend. This will end any type of hope of finding someone else. Try and find a good friend you can confide in and hopefully talking about it will help you get over him. Time does heal all wounds, but only if you are willing to. Good luck.|`|iRZK0KFbaa	start dating again|`|yy45iAbtaa	get  over it and move on.go out and find someone else.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Move on with your life.  As you already stated you argued a lot and he's your ex for that reason and probably more.  Quit living in the past and start living in the present.
YVJQ7Y4jaa	No! Your Brother-In-law has feelings. What makes you think that you are Gods gift to humanity? I see from your post that you are self-centered, egocentric and devoid of feeling. You Sir, are far uglier than he is. Your inner self is lacking.|`|AA12198711	You portray yourself as a very shallow person here.     I feel sorry for the family that surrounds you.|`|5r48jn7iaa	that's messed up! hes family it called a FAMILY PORTRAIT. its definitely not ok!|`|JlDcVTVsaa	No, It will really hurt his feelings.    Im sure he is already very sensitive because of the way he looks, and this is just not nice to tell some one they cant be in the family picture because they are fat.    Maybe you can put him, in a place that will attract less attention when looking at the picture?  or put him behind some people that are seating?|`|r3WkhpBpaa	No way! He is a part of your family, and you should treat him the way you would like to be treated. You know I am sure you have your own flaws...everyone does.

What if that was you, would you want someone to say that you need to get out of the piture cause your short, fat and homely and from the murky end of the gene pool and your palms face backwards when you walk?  I think that you need to be nice to him cause everyone has problems with their in-laws and most of them r worse then yours.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	he still is family and all family members should be in the family pictures,and it would hurt his feelings if he would not be in the pictures.  physical appearance  doesnt matter what matters is the personality|`|Otu7QfqAaa	NO! how rude and the nerve to say that!..

(:    call the cops(:    she is a b**ch!|`|6xBpOeqMaa	crazy! i would advice calling the police to get it on paper. then find a new girl!!|`|6sAPIvvjaa	Good Lord, she tried to run you down and you really have no idea why? Come on man, dig a little deeper because it's obvious to everyone here that you must have done something to provoke her response. I call it a response because she is responding to something you did, or something she thinks you did, or maybe something you didn't do but were supposed to. The easiest way to find out is to ask her, calling her on the phone might not be best but it would help to ensure you can maintain a safe distance. If you do decide to go to her house, bring a cell phone and make sure you have 911 on speed dial. If you think it may still be too dangerous try calling her best friend and get them to tell you what it is that she is so upset about, they will probably also have some suggestions as to how to can make things right. Good luck and look both ways before crossing the street.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	haha she hates you|`|kgVAUIHoaa	Bahahahaha.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	Call the police!    If this is true    if not...lol classic movie scene!|`|zwdGBrUZaa	omg thats horrible!  ask her why in the hell would she do that  maybe she was kidding, or thought you did something bad|`|Tq2ecVxNaa	CALL THE POPO.|`|pf4m3JI4aa	u need to pay it back, try to run over her  tit for tat :D  Do not leave any business unfinished  she started it, you end it  VROOOOOOOOM!!!!!
5vOV8XVhaa	Find some other parents out there with 6 year olds, there has got to be some people out there as tired as you. So here is what you do, offer to watch the kids the first time, and then they watch them the second time. Your kid will be less trouble if they have somebody to play with. (yes kids are a blessings, but sometimes a bit hard to manage).  This way, you get rest, the other parent gets rest, and your kids have fun while your doing it.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	My suggestion is to get a support system. I know it sounds difficult, but there are support groups, programs, and counselors out there for people just like you. There are also volunteer opportunities, churches, and clubs. You need to start meeting people, making friends, and making connections with people who can provide you with the support you need. You may not have a lot of time, but MAKE the time somewhere and do this, even if you have to hire a sitter a couple of times. You will be doing yourself a favor AND your child a favor as well.    Good luck!|`|lCWIYPLtaa	just put an ad out there for a babysitter its worth the money|`|IDrA6gMxaa	As a single mom you won;t have to much free time. but once in a while, hire a babysitter and go out - cinema, restaurant. Invite your friends and have fun, real fun. You need to relax sometimes.|`|L6cywARAaa	Network with other parents make trade days watching each others child/ren making a point per child per hour trade equal. Play dates work too.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	Do a mothers day out kind of thing. sometimes at churches or gymnastics gyms and such will have "parents nite" where you pay like $15 from 6-11pm. Go online and see what you can find.  Join a singles group, go to church and allow her to go to class and make friends that she might be able to spend time with.  My neighborhood has a bulletin that has a list of babysitters available.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	PLAY DATES!!! Play dates are always best. Every parent has kids that are very tiring. Your little girls parents would most likely like it if you offered to watch their kid. Then the next time they would watch and so on.  Its really simple.  Find a new job with better hours. I know in this economy its hard.|`|n53HeORBaa	can you afford a nanny? even on sundays, given your current situation, i don't think that you would have enough time on your own, only a nanny can help, just hire her on sundays, like for 5 hours, that would be enough time for you to relax, do your hair and nails and other stuff that you want..or at least twice a month at least you can take some of the load off your shoulders
AA12204338	I don't thinks so at all.  Florida is Natl champs!  And GO GATORS!!!!!!!!!!|`|seB7nC9Waa	I DON'T THINK SO  .|`|oUm2Nzi6aa	Maybe, but I can understand his actions.  That's like being really unattractive in high school and then getting really hot a few years down the road and going back to show it off to the guys who turned you down.
L6cywARAaa	I am so sorry for your loss...I am sure you have family also feeling that loss. Talk to them on the phone if not in person. Look in the newspaper for a support group.  Sometimes a call can help.  Check the internet harder find a number to call.  Talk to your loved one you lost in your prayers.  That helps too.    I nearly lost my mother last month she was on full life support. It was very emotional and sad to see her laying their never moving..She is till in the hospital now 6 weeks.  Baby steps to getting out of the over priced hospital.   Sorry, I had stuff to say too.    Keep looking Good luck!|`|mLUELEkFaa	I would go to your community centre and look for groups. Call a help centre they can usually direct you the right way. The sites on the internet can sometimes be too overwhelming rather than helpful.   Good luck!  I am here to listen if you need it|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Try www.meetup.com  They have just about every kind of group, and it is listed in proximity by zip code.
YVJQ7Y4jaa	About 10. People who do not discipline their child, should not have children. Discipline shows love and respect. Look at the animal kingdom, all animals discipline their offspring, why? To protect their kind, to teach their offspring what is dangerous. Dont tell me you are not an animal. You are not a rock, nor are you gas or liquid, therefore we fall into the category of animal.   The problem with our society is the lack of discipline in anything.  Children punching their mother or father. Really good, the new liberal way of raising a child. Many military Moms complaining about their child being cussed at, or smacked. Who do you call when he/she is being subjected to torture by the enemy?|`|AA11211511	Never,you shouldn't hit your child.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	12|`|Otu7QfqAaa	I would say whatever age they can truly grasp the concept of what they did and the consequences.  Also, if you are struggling with disicpline adn your child there are many different technques that could work better without using physical force.    www.keepkidshealthy.com/parenting_tips...|`|0Nfr3leOaa	never hit ur child and it wrong and mean use other punishments like time out ETC.....|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Heather     I've seen children in thier 40's that could a used a good whoopin...    Hitting should never be a regular or routine event, the physical punishment should be the last "Do You Hear Me" resort to communicate with those in need of a life changing meeting of the minds.    Never toss out or limit any of your parental options ... as a parent you need a big bag of tricks ...    The other day I saw a lady in her 60's slap her son across the mouth for a really rank degrading comment he made about a woman who wasn't present. She told him she never raised him to used that language and will not stand for then or now in her presence ....     it worked very well.    Go Mom !|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	I agree with Prison Officer, there is nothing wrong with spanking and never has been.  I think that's what's wrong with half the kids today, they need their butts whooped!     10 definitely the oldest if not a little younger. My dad spanked me when I was 14 years old, that was the last time and I remember being like - are you done yet? Because it was just ridiculous. At some point they will start finding ways to get back at you so that's when you ground them instead of spanking them. Teenagers are very smart and very coniving (sp?). I know I was! So spanking will NEVER work on older kids.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Age 3 or 4, when they reach the age of understanding that their actions have consequences.    I have 3 children.  I can count on both hands the total number of times all of them were spanked.    Spanking was used for safety issues ONLY, like "you do not run into the street, you hold mommy's hand in the parking lot at the store, you do not get into the swimming pool unless daddy is there," that sort of thing.    When it came to safety issues, I didn't care if I damaged their little psyches or not - I wanted them to be safe.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I think the last time we got a spanking, I was about 12... other than that, I can remember a time or two when my Mom slapped me across the face for being disrespectful or using fowl language.... And you know what? I respect her more now than ever... I'm glad they set limits and stuck to them.... showed me that rules were made to be followed and if I chose to break them, then I would have to deal with the consequences.... I've also spent time grounded when I was around 15 or so... etc... Believe me... you learn QUICK.    As far as now, my children are disciplined in several ways.... spanking is our final strand... but we start off with their nose in the corner (time outs) where they have to be quiet for so many minutes.... then, other times I'll just keep making their bed time earlier by 30 minutes for each incident.... they hate going to be early. :-)    So, in our house... we have general rules... and if they are not followed, then we discipline. Some may call me mean, but what ever.... I may be mean in their eyes, but my children love and respect us PLUS, I have well behaved children about 98% of the time - all thanks ot discipline and showing that there are consequences for their actions.|`|tWzIsIH0aa	My guess would be 6 / 7. At that time, spanking should be phased out. They are old enough to comprehend the consequences of their behavior.|`|SsfnitjXaa	A spanking is never appropriate.|`|IE5vmmQEaa	My son is 2 when he does something wrong I spank his hand..and he's going throough a phase of cursing so I tap him in his mouth (not hard at all)and now he's starting to learn and when I say stop or your gonna get powpow he's stops there is a big differnece between spanking and beating I would never beat my kids
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	my marriage of 10 yrs ended abruptly, never saw it coming. its been 5 yrs, i am finally okay with it. its only when i was willing to see him for the jerk he was that i began to get well. before that i remained sad and hurt. once u realize that this was not about u u will feel better. i did immediately find a new love, at first it felt strange, but as time passed i began to feel the love i always deserved.betrayal is one of the hardest to get over, because it involves the ego. unfortunately it is harder to get past when there are children involved and u have to see that person allot. seek some self help therapy, get a support system or friends or family, let it out talk about your pain. without going through the grieving process u will never be able to heal. u will go through times u feel your over it only to find yourself sad again, because it is a sad thing when the love of our life rips our heat out. just stop blaming yourself, it has nothing to do with u, its all within her and this is who she is, its nothing u could have done and no matter what u tried to change, the outcome would have been the same. prayer does wonders, even if your not a believer, connecting with the lord helps in times like this because your focused on something else rather than a woman who doesn't deserve your love.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Many churches have divorce recovery seminars that help people realize they're not alone in what they're going through or feeling.  I know you don't have a lot of time (if you have your children 26 days a month), but you need to do something to help take care of you.  Check around and see if there are any programs like this in your area.  Many of the programs have childcare available.    You deserve a big pat on the back for stepping up and taking care of your children full time.    ((hugs))|`|wqchA8B7aa	It takes 2-3 years. I was there also, we had one child, and were married for 7 years.     My ex used to call me and tell me she still wished we were together (etc), then be hateful and find other men. Just get on with your life and find someone new. I did, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	I hear you... 7 years, unfailthful...(him) and stuck myself...only been 2 months for me.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Well I wasn't with the person for 10 years but it took me about 2 years to get over him. It's mostly the fact that the person cheated and you can't help but keep thinking 'what did I do wrong'. Everyone is different and usually finding yourself someone else does quicken the healing process|`|AA11085356	Everyone is different. Time will tell. Start doing things for yourself. Get a sitter once or twice a month and go out with a couple friends and have a good time. There is nothing wrong with having fun once in a while. Don't be afraid to talk to other women. I don't mean you have to go out and find a girlfriend right away or anything, but just talking to other women over a drink, or lunch or something could help you see that there is more out there. Don't rush into anything, I don't think you are ready after reading all of your questions. But I think a few friends will help.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	We were together for 24 years and parted only to care for aging parents.  If infidelity had been a problem we'd not have lasted 24 months.  There's no such thing as cheating!  (Also, we never married and we never lived together.  Real love doesn't need that!)|`|QGuxbItCaa	I was married for 26 years, and she committed adultery. I was over her as soon as I buried her in the back yard.|`|4AbXxowTaa	First cut is the deepest.  I'd say stay busy and date some women, should help.|`|AA11226842	Its a loss like a death and the process is just the same. No one grieves the same so it will take you as long as you need to heal.|`|vm1Fj2AVaa	I think you should try and date.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	We were only married 6 years but I was so in love with him and his betrayal destroyed me. It's been over a year for me and I am still a mess. I think 2 years seems about right, at least for me. And I have a boyfriend, but it doesn't take away all the feelings and years history with your ex-spouse. And I have no contact with him at all. It must be really hard having to see your ex regularly because of your kids, and to deal with her behavior. I can't even imagine being in that situation.|`|8txWayVnaa	Well. . .that's kind of hard to say.    I was married for a total of 13 years.  The first time my (now) ex-husband had an affair, it was 3 years into the marriage, and right around the time my first child was born.  I was devastated, but we worked through it as best we could.  The second time (at least the second time I found out about it) he had an affair, I was done.  Turned my feelings off like a faucet.  But I can be cold like that--it's a defense mechanism that I honed since childhood (had a jacked-up childhood).    I'm sorry you are having so much trouble dealing with things, but everyone is different, and deals differently.  Get yourself some counseling and talk through it.  Time will heal your wounds--find some healthy distractions in the meantime.|`|KbZIsj7Caa	18 months and still stuck...well it took me a few months, all I did was do thing that occupy my time and thoughts, and I had really close friends who also helped me. But once I got out and meeting new people time flew and I met the man Im with now, and he and I have been together over 6 years. So J, get out the house with adult friends, and find something youre interested in to do that will occupy your time and thoughts, try something fun.|`|CAgSgtrUaa	that all depends on you and how you deel with your problems maybe you should start to do things on our own clear your head and take a vacation|`|bAY9j21Paa	Im sorry to hear that, but it usually takes half of the time you knew the person, so... probably about 5 years, but since you have kids with her, those are for life.. if you TRULY loved her, you will probably never officially "be over her" Even if you move on down the road and get married you will never really ever be over her. She is your babies momma for gosh sakes. Did you two try counseling? I hope she didnt jsut cheat and you two called it quits.. You know she cheated for a reason right? You are mad now and may not understand but,.,. people cheat for an underlying reason...Saying that she has three kids, she is probably self consious and you dont compliment her enough or make her feel good about ehrself so she goes and gets it somewhere else. I dunno thats sad, i would try counseling, if anything.. it will make you two understand eachother better and raise your kids better with eachother. Best of luck... Married for only 5 years.. and we have gone through a few things, we have three kids, but we worked through it. We would never just end it over that..unless it ever continued.|`|g6ENt03Oaa	It honestly depends on the person. Everyone is diffirent and everyone heals diffirently. It may take you 2 years it may take you 5 (I hope it's sooner then 5 though). You've been with her for 10 years of course it's going to be hard.   I would surgest keeping a diary it doesn't have to be on paper you can put it in word. Don't read it for 10 years at least (if ever) that way you can look back if you want too and see how far you've progressed.  Most women will be spiteful toward a man if they are feeling guilt for what they have done but some genuinlly don't care.   You have my deepest sympathies it's never easy breaking up.|`|3QiKTfqeaa	oh my darling. I can tell you are not over here and are still mourning the loss of your marriage. The right answer is how ever long you want to stay in this place of un happiness is all up to you. if you being sad is taking over all the other joyous parts of your life then you need to take a more proactive approach. perhaps you need to socialize more, or pick a hobby like bowling, or golf..  while you are socializing with other women you are focused on them (or should be). or while enjoying an activity you will be focusing on the good time you are having right then. yes when you go home you may still have bouts of sadness but in time you will think less and less about it. it takes time, now that you recognize there is a problem , it can start to get better. i don't know if you are a religious man, but for me prayer and a good cry helps.. i am wishing you the best!|`|r25LTHUAaa	I can not tell you from personal experience, only what I have noticed in family members, my father in particular. He was with my mother for about 25 years prior to the divorce and it has taken him about 3 years to get over it. Other friends of mine have moved on faster. I don't think any one can give you a time frame, but you must not rush your feelings along. It may help to talk to someone whether its just a friend you are comfortable with or a Professional, this often helps get out what you may be bottling up, thus enabling you to heal faster.    Have you started to date yet? Get out there, mingle, meet new people, believe me this will help the most. Also if you have no start doing all the things you have always wanted to do but couldn't! Take this time to be a bit selfish, and as soon as you stop thinking about getting over your ex. you will find that you are!    Good Luck!|`|ee2ce7f4a4671d3a72fbfecf0348ee49aa	there is no set time period and to believe there is one will set yourself up for failure.  you need to come to terms with what has happened and I have found that that is best done by changing your lifestyle to be more extroverted.  Not ignoring what has happened ... but finding things that please you and pursuing them... be it playing a musical instrument .. volunteering at your church ... joining a support group (which worked very well for a friend)  the goal is not to occupy your time to ignore the pain but to find joy in other things that make the pain less of a significant factor on your life.  It may also help to include your children in you exploits ... I find that church groups tend to be helpful even if you don't belong to that church.  a nearby church out here goes hiking and picnics every sat ... it is a great place to make quality friends|`|9eb6f758f576f969b160920cc22751a2aa	Its not too late to get on with your goodlife as the past has now well gone there is life after divorce just put the experience behind you and move on . This does work|`|8nJKFfygaa	i have been married for over 10 years and she committed adultery just on a year ago.    At first I was blaming myself and trying to make it work (as we have 2 young kids) and try councelling and the like (she walked out).  Over the course of about 6 months I let myself be kicked down and dragged on the ground all over the place by her, and it does make you insecure and wondering all about it and 'what have I done that could have caused this' then it dawned on me; i have done NOTHING wrong, i always communicated, I always gave her the oppertunity to communicate, I was tentative and supportive of her jobs (she has a part time and a full time job) I have a full time job and find my self looking after the kids primarily while she continues to go on business trips, late late nights, out on weekends while I am looking after the kids.  After that dawned on me that i have exhausted all possibilities that I might have done something wrong and came up with nothing, even the things she was accusing me of where incorrect she was trying to justify what she had done, I became emotionally detached as it was her chioce to do what she did, just as it was your wifes choice to do what she has done and continues to do. Javier, you and I have been dealt with women who love us, then then just want excitement and another life, they get to a point and say 'is that it?' then they look outside the box, i relate it to an early mid life evaluation of sorts.    You are a fantastic father and your kids and everyone on YA can see that, please live for them, your faith in god will guide you to youre happy place, its just a bit of a journey to get there...    nobody can say how long it will take you to get over it, everyont is different, until they have walked in your shoes they cant possibly give you a time. the only answer i can offer you is, when you are ready to emotionally detatch, you will...
0qLJXy3Zaa	you're right but just be calm with her. it soudns like you were but don't let it become something bigger then it really is. i'd try and plan another girls night asap.|`|ayjYddo1aa	Maybe you should apologize for the way you spoke but not for the fact she brought up Jordan.

CYjrHrmAaa	Its called a garter.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	its a garter and now-a-days they are just for show.  back in the old old days women held their stockings up with garters and often used really pretty ones for their weddings~|`|AA11490722	a garter- back in the day they were used to hold up ladies stockings.  these days they are usually just for show- at some weddings it is traditional for the groom to remove the garter from the bride with his teeth and then toss it over his shoulder to all the unmarried men at the wedding. The man who catches the garter is said to be the next to get married|`|2E08nZR3aa	It's called a garter. It's actually to hold up stockings.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Garter. It used to be for holding up stockings, but now it is used as something for the groom to throw (as the bride throws the bouquet) to the single men to see which of them will be married next. It is also very often used as a bride's something blue. Hope this helped!|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	It's a garter. The point is that your husband takes it off and toss it to the single men at the wedding. There are usually two garters in a wedding set. One is a keepsake garter, and the other a toss garter. As the name suggests, you keep the keepsake garter as a reminder of your wedding, and the toss garter is the one your husband throws to the crowd.    As far as non-wedding usage, the garter is typically worn sexily over stockings, or with a thigh-high and garter belt set. "crimson" mentioned that a garter holds up the stockings, but that is actually what a garter belt does now (the thing you wear around your waist that clips to thigh-highs). It use to do this, but now it's decorative.
5HTylrjGaa	Unfortunately that's life.     First off, you are very pretty! Take it as a compliment that guys are showing you so much attention; many girls would kill just to have a guy look in their direction.    Those years are supposed to be the most fun years of dating. But they're also the most turbulent. Very few people meet their "soul mate" at the age of 17. Some who are lucky do, but most don't.     It seems to me that you are approaching each relationship with the intention that it works, which is not a good idea at the beginning. I don't know if this will work for you, but what I do is to just go with the flow for the first few dates. Hey if it works, great! If it doesn't, well it was a learning experience that I can use for the next one! After a few dates and I see that this can go somewhere do I start expecting it to. It saves alot of stress, and let's you enjoy meeting and interact with people even though they are not people you want to keep seeing. That's what makes it "fun."    But don't get discouraged. You are very young, you have many, many more years to go. You will meet that right guy. Just try to enjoy yourself and not to take it too seriously. :)|`|Ll3Qt8Wyaa	Just be lucky you get anything. SOme girls/guys have never dated or anything. So your complaining makes you seem eager for compliments or something. Like i say there are ppl out there that have never been in a relationship and aren't nice looking. Be lucky someone wans you or has wanted you.|`|AA10391286	About to give up? on what? lol you're only 17.      You will always find your greatest loves when you're not looking.  Take some time to enjoy your life, work on some goals, set yourself up for a good life and the men will fall at your feet.  Quit worrying so much about the boys, you have more to concentrate on.  You can't possibly know what you want at this age or in the next 5 years. You'll continually change even after you hit 30.  My advice is date, date a lot. This will result in finding out what you don't want in a relationship and be able to make a better and quicker decision on who is right for you in the future when you're more experienced with love.|`|56XwyVW9aa	First off you called it right! It is what we all have when we first start off  new relationship. That is the butterflies in the stomach and the world revolves around him / her. As you are finding out that feeling does not last and now the work of staying in love comes into play!    I could keep preaching, but let me recommend a GREAT website from a marriage minister. He has a book for single also. www.fivelovelanguages.com. I would start there and find out what your love language is and have your past boyfriends been giving you that!     Now for the HARD part! See if you can recognize your past boyfriend's love languages and see if you have been providing that to them!    Last note. I noticed that you felt the need to post your pic and you are attractive. LOOKS CHANGE and the physical attraction has to be replaced with a MENTAL bond!    GOOD LUCK!|`|BS2WwF7Raa	your right...your not just some good looking girl...NOT AT ALL. lol.|`|RAv0c8VKaa	well the only advice i can give you is befriend someone you like and see if they like you.i know i think ur cute|`|uQu1K6rbaa	You are only 17? There is sooo much time do date!|`|oo9ZNCTTaa	No one can make you "happy"...you can.  Keep an open heart and an open mind.  If you want flowers...buy them for yourself. If you wait for those things from someone else, you will ALWAYS be waiting.

Take it easy and trust, you will have that fairy tale life soon enough.|`|DZP8b9sXaa	You can't rush things.  And behind every "perfect" fairytale is a fatal flaw.

You're only 17.  You've got a lifetime of relationships ahead.  You win some and you lose some.  The sun will still come up.

You never know where you will meet that special person, but you have a good head on your shoulders so dont settle for less he will come girl don't stress it!  IF you are in college or you will be going soon,  You will meet so many people there, just have fun!|`|UfELDZoMaa	We all have a time when we say we will give up. Your very pretty. You are bound to have men of all types approach you. But mostly, Most men who approach are Dogs. Find a shy guy. A guy who is nervous around you because you are so beautiful. He will Love you for the rest of your life. Even if he isn't mister Popular. You can fix his looks up later.    Loud mouth guys are usually wife beaters and fist fighting bar hoppers. Get a dork. Dorks are great lovers, we usually have stable jobs and we stay true. Guys with lesser amounts of friends are good too, because they are soiled with corruption on how to seduce women and use them like rag dolls|`|X7fJjXFuaa	you're only 17. this is not at all to be condescending, but there are going to be so many more relationships in your life. in ten years, you're going to laugh at the losers you dated in high school and feel embarrassed that you ever thought you'd be with one of them "forever."    trust me, have fun. relax.     there is also a lot more to life than having boyfriends. get an education. travel. spend time with your friends. volunteer for causes that you believe in. learn something new. challenge yourself.    i have a million suggestions, but overall, you are young and life is just beginning for you.     good luck. :)|`|df14a975e88aa3ace30d8ccaf12bf3e6aa	What, you expected to find your perfect mate by age 17?

eRg04AoEaa	First, not everyone drinks, smokes & has casual sex at 18. Some of us are responsible & smart enough not to even go there at all.    Second... I think it's ridiculous for people to get married before the age of 76. Okay okay, maybe 30. I got married when I was 20 yrs old going on 16. I was way too young, inside & out! I will always regret that. My husband was 32 when we married. I think that was a perfect age for people get married!     Most teenagers aren't very bright anyways, especially these days, so how could the make the most important decision in their life then? Everyone should wait till they're at least 30.... or 76.|`|pMsMx817aa	i read this off of my friends blog on myspace  it was all about labels    here is the short version:  I'm white but I have Black friends so I must try to act Black  I'm american so I must be a warmongerer  I'm canada so I must like hockey and say eh all the time  I wear black so I must be goth  I'm a punk so I must be a pot head  I wear skirts so I must be a sl*t  I'm a young mom so I must be uneducated  I'm a young wife so I must be retarded and immature    I'm a person so I must be labeled    and that blog was so true... so many people label eachother and stereotype and generalize... its pathetic      I think people should do what they want to do.  No one gets anywhere by Following the crowd - charlie brown quote    i'm proud to say that i'll be getting married at 18 years old this july.  i met the love of my lif and we're getting married.  some people dont like it,  but thats not my problem.      everyone should feel free to make their own choice without having people tear them down.    this is how i really feel, some couples are ready at 18 some aren't and thats perfectly fine! there's nothing wrong with that, there's also nothing wrong with getting married at 18.    i don't care about being accepted by society, i love my boyfriend and i could care less what people think.      good question by the way,  ella|`|l43NSgHyaa	No, I don't think it's good.  Society says that we are adults at 18.  But, we can't drink to 21 and they charge us outrageous car insurance, until we reach the magic number of 25.      The truth is, we are "adults" by a legal standpoint.  But, our society, really knows that for the most part, a lot of growth is done between the age of 18-25 on mental, social and psychological level.  That's why, they say we can't drink to 21, because we aren't responsible enough to understand the consequences.  We have to pay extra car insurance, because our society knows we aren't experienced enough, until we get to that age range.    So, most of society is right, marriage is better after 25 and after we've developed more life skills and matured more.|`|Bru5jJZraa	I think some people during this age misunderstand the big picture of spending every single day of your entire life with this person...    I do believe some people are mature enough to realize the commitment at such a young age and are strong enough to accept the responsibilities of  marriage.|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	i would say 24 or 25 not 18|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	I raise a brow at people in their teens getting married, but I got married last August, when I was 23.  You really can't go by anything but the maturity of the individuals in each particular case.  My husband is 32, so in our case, it wasn't two young people rushing into something.     I think at least waiting until your 20's is a good idea.  You still have a lot of growing up to do when you're 18.|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	you know what I was just thinking about this. They let you buy cigarettes at 18 even go to war and get killed at 18 although they do not let you purchase alcohol which is ridiculous. I think if you want to get married at 18 and feel like you are in love and ready then go for it, hey you can pretty much do everything why not tie the knot. They even say a woman should get married by the age of 23 to have a lasting marriage. I mean if you want to wait until your 30 go right ahead its your life. Everyone has a say in their own lives but its sucks because no matter what you do you will always be judged for doing ''adult'' things at 18. So just screw everyone else and do what you want.|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	I think if you are ready at eighteen it's ok.  People use to get married at 13, but the world was a different place then.|`|MLFBsZnUaa	Personally, I think it depends on each individual. Some 18 yr olds are way too immature and too into "partying" and the such to truly understand what it will mean to spend the rest of their life with one person. However, other 18 yr olds could be highly mature for their age, incredibly responsible, and has a deep understanding of what marriage means and signifies. Actually, the same goes for any age. You could be 50 and still be too immature to handle and understand something as major as marriage. As I said, I think it is more of an individual thing rather than something that should be lumoed together saying that all 18-25 yr olds shouldnt get married because they are too young. All depends on the person.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	I guess it would depend on the maturity level. I agree with you about the contradicting stereotypes.  I just turned 21 and plan on getting married next year to my bf of 3 years. 3 years ago I was 18 and would've married him then as well (well I've actually known him for 8 yrs). It basically depends on the individual and they would have to be the judge of that.|`|ScHW4842aa	if the two of you enter into the agreement knowing it is for life, and marry because you see that you are each reliable and kind hearted people, then it will work.     if you get married for excitement and all that other rubbish - and want a fairy tale - then it wont last a month. Seriously.     Do you know how many times, I have had to wait up at night for my husband to come home from work? To put aside my own feelings and comfort him because he is worried or etc? look past the past and look to the future? To sit down and sort out finances with him?     Do I sound serious?   Well - guess what - IM 18 and married.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	i am 18 and i have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. he is currently in the military and we are not married...yet!    i really want to get married. we have been through it all (seriously, pretty much EVERYTHING) and we are still madly in love. we have been together a lot longer than most people i know before they were married. i don't think there is anything wrong with getting married at 18. if your parents dont agree, at least you are an adult and there is a city hall!|`|oXfvBdNHaa	I think it souly depends on the individual and how they were raised. I will be 20 when I am married, been with my fiance since we were 14 and am totally ready to commit for life. I was raised knowing you love and choose to keep love around, and choose to commit for life. It is a choice to grow apart as a couple.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I totally agree with "jen".  People really do change so much between 18 and 25.  My fiance and I are 23 and just got engaged in December and have set our wedding date for June 2010.  By that time we will be 24 and 25.      I don't think there is a set "right" age for getting married. I was a very mature 18 year old, but if I would have married the guy I was with at 18, the marriage wouldn't have lasted.  We dated for 6 years, but by the time we broke up when I was almost 21, we were two very different people.     I know a lot of 18 year olds on here will argue that they are "mature for their age", and I'm sure they really are in love with their partner (I was when I was 18), but when you are 18 you really don't know what you want out of life or what direction your life will head in.  You are just getting out into the world on your own and it is probably the first time that you REALLY started thinking about things, about your future and what is important to you.  I know things now about myself that I didn't know at 18.    And it's true that statistically those who marry a little older tend to be more likely for the marriage to last.  I don't really understand why someone at 18 would rush into something just to be married to the one they love, when they would have a better chance at being with that person for life if they waited a few years ... like having a longer engagement or just dating until they are in their 20's.|`|5iL7gqAGaa	you dont know anything at 18 im 17 andi barely know anythign mann DONT get married at 18 when your 21/22 i think its aiight but its your choice/opinion so yea|`|SCccHTInaa	I would say you should wait because you are still young and just arrived at adulthood and still have not experience what life truly is. Personally, being 18 myself, i am in love with my gf whom is working abroad at the moment and have been apart for 4 months. I love her so much that i am going against my parents, work just to go there for our 1 year. But i know myself that i am not ready to be married. Before i marry someone i want them to be reassured that they are financially insured and i know that i am mature enough to spend my entire life with that one person and stay completely faithful and devoted and committed.|`|6aac3576e9ac2269512e9cedce300879aa	If this question is about you, be prepared to here this all the time...OH MY GOD REALLY! YOU"RE SO YOUNG!!...Don't listen to them .  People should marry when they please.But they must carefully think it through. All the positives and negatives. That is when they will learn if it is right or wrong. Not age.     Some people frown upon young marriages.because maybe they're jealous or getting old and have yet to be proposed to. I mean i don't want 14 yrs old to marry but once you are an adult the world is yours.|`|6QvilEZ1aa	I am 23, and got married when I was 22, almost exactly a year ago. People can say what they want about age but in the end it's really about if you're with the right person and if you're ready for the commitment and changes it will bring. Even though I haven't been married long, I dated him for 7 seven years before we got married (since I was 15). I was crazy about him from the beginning, but we didn't rush into marriage. It wasn't because I wasn't sure about him, it was simply because we weren't ready to support ourselves and we both wanted to finish college.    Now that I am married, I can't believe how much my life has changed and how much I've had to grow up. It's not so much that our relationship suddenly changed or anything, it continues to grow stronger every day just like before, but that all of sudden we had to support ourselves and pay bills and just grow up. That was the biggest thing for me. This first year of marriage was very hard because we just had to negotiate all this new stuff and deal with the new responsibilities.    Don't let what other people think decide what's right for you. There' s always exceptions to the rule. After all, for our parents and grandparents it was normal to get married young. Going to college and women focusing on careers has just delayed marriage for a lot of people.|`|eCfJCP6vaa	Honestly, I don' believe age plays a factor in this area, it is the maturity level of the young adult coward. You are right; this particular age group are well known for partying hard, yet they are also known for disregarding responsibilities, which are a couple of ingredients needed in maintaining a marriage. I think everyone considering marriage should wait until they are truly sure that is the next step in their lives that they want to take. Talk about with family members and their fiancee. Make sure they have experienced everything they wanted to experience independently before they consider entering a union.|`|v66sauD1aa	Well, I think that a lot of people at those ages rush into marriage thinking it's going to be all wedded bliss and babies, not really anticipating the work that marriage is. Yeah, it is bliss and hopefully babies but that's not all. Of course I know couples who have been in love practically their whole lives and get married and are ridiculously crazy about eachother. Who knows?|`|28WJwHf4aa	I was married at 25 (1 mos. shy of 26) and my husband had just turned 26.    It's not a stereotype or scam. Research has shown that divorce rates drastically drop if a couple waits to be 25+. People grow and mature and change between the ages of 18-25, which is why it is said it's better to wait.     Had I married the boy I thought I was "in-love" with at 18, I can guarantee you I'd probably be divorced and have 2-3 kids...or stuck in a marriage that was miserable.    Now, it's not to say that *every* marriage at 18 is doomed. My inlaws were married at 18 and are still together. However, my parents were married at 18 and had a miserable marriage.|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	I think marrying at 18-20 is too young, but over that is ok. It's best to graduate from college first so you can be financially independent and done with studying! My bf and I are both 23 and we are planning to get married this year. We've been together since we were 19 and I have no interest in casual sex, and I don't expect to feel I missed out on anything later.     The reason I think 18 is too young is not because I think people need to date around or sleep around at that age, but because they are still growing up and may change their goals and ideals quite a bit. I know I have changed since age 18.|`|SgifdUUYaa	Well since men and women's fertility peaks at 23 years old...perhaps its a good idea in regard to children...    Other than that...  There are many pros and cons regarding this.  Some advantages are however;    1. Growing up together (instead of growing up by yourself and trying to find this idealist "fit" that can be harder)    2. You look hella good on your wedding day    3. Not as many sexual partners (less baggage)    Cons;  1. Not as financially stable (most common problem of divorce)    2, Too immature (not nessa)|`|AA12240708	i would say it all depends on the person. i am 19 and getting married next month, i am very mature and responsible, where as my sister is 26 and so immature. it all depends on the person. my aunt got married when she was 17 and her and my uncle have been married for 47 years. My grandmother was 16 and she got married to my grandfather 6 days after they met and they were married for 72 years until the day she died. its not age that matters, its your mind and maturity level.
AA11312653	If you are going to be a host, then that means you must treat your guests as guests and provide the refreshments for them. You have several options.  (1) Entertain in a style you can better afford, such as brunch, breakfast, lunch instead of supper, or a less expensive restaurant. Along with this, the restaurant manager instructs the serving staff to be sure your guests understand that they are responsible for their own alcoholic beverages. A good server does this tactfully, by offering soft drinks and if a guest asks for alcohol, inquiring whether the guest "Would you like to start a bar tab?" This lets guests know that they will paying for thier own booze without making a big public announcement of it.  (2) Invite only a very small party to be your guests for the meal. Tell the other people whom you invite to witness the marriage that the family will be having dinner at a certain restaurant and that you wish you could treat everyone and you'll be more happy than to arrange reservations for anyone who would like to also to have dinner at this restaurant after the marriage. Do you see where this is subtly different from asking them to be your guests? That offering to make the reservation discreetly alerts them while you would be very pleased to see them, they will be paying thier own bill? If you choose this option and can afford it, please consider sponsoring those who join you to a desert or other treat.   (3) Let everyone know that your budget is X amount of dollars and this means dinner for 30 at Denny's unless some angels want to step forward and make an ANONYMOUS contribution toward a nicer party. The anonymous part is to ensure that this does not appear to be an attempt to blackmail or bully unwilling people iinto contributing funds they can not or prefer not to contribute. Keep everyone posted as your funds allow to progress from Denny's to Outback Steakhouse and so on. You will need to do your research have a good idea of how much dinner for 30 at various restaurants will cost.     Congrats and best wishes.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi Jen and congratulations!    Your plans sound nice (the ceremony and the reception), but, YES, it's rude to ask your guests to pay.      Just as you wouldn't invite someone over for dinner and then when they are leaving say, "you owe me $10 for the meal".....well, it's the same with weddings.    I do understand that this is family, but it's still rude.  If you invite...then you pay.    Good luck and I hope your day is wonderful!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	It's very rude. The term guests denotes they do not have to pay, and I would never attend a wedding if I had to pay for myself. If you can't afford to pay for them, have a dinner at your home and prepare food yourself.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	It would depend on how close I was to the couple.  If I wasn't close, then I'd send a card.  If I was close, I'd probably go.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes it is rude. Guests never pay for anything themselves. The hosts (bride and groom) pay for everything.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Yes, it's definitely rude to ask your guests to pay for their own meals - that's like saying "I want you to come to my wedding and give me attention and a gift, but I don't care enough about you to buy your dinner."    Maybe that's not what you intend to convey, but that's definitely how it will feel to your guests.    If the issue is cost (you don't mind paying for the roasted chicken but don't want to treat greedy cousin Bobby to the 5 pound lobster), put together a menu just for your party and tell the restaurant NOT to pass out their normal menus. Select a range of items from the normal menu that are appropriate for your budget, type them up (include the descriptions but leave off the prices), and print them on beautiful paper. It will look special and thoughtful, not cheap.    Any reception is really a way for the couple to thank their guests for their love and support throughout their lives. It's a gift to them, which means that you should pay.|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	I'm sorry, but I would consider this very rude myself.  The idea is that your guests are honoring you by witnessing your special event, and you show your gratitude with the reception.  I understand how expensive weddings can be, but maybe you should consider providing appetizers and deserts, which won't cost as much as full meals for everyone.|`|262016589c2b056459386b15672dd2c8aa	Yes.  Create a raffle, use the dollar dance, put out a donation bowl, whatever.  People having a fun, stress free time will give.|`|aBPNeRA9aa	I know where you are coming from when you ask this. I understand how expensive a wedding could be but it is a little rude to have your guests, even though they are family, to pay for their meal. I have a suggestion though and that is to have the reception at the same place you are getting married and possibly getting your family to bring a dish each to it.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Just don't have the dinner at all.  You could just have a small reception with a cake at someone's house.  I think if you have a dinner you really do have to foot the bill.  You might talk to some of your family and see if they could chip in and cover some of the cost.  Your mother in law is being very uncaring because she is not concerned about the financial burden it is on you.  She should offer to pay for part of it.  I paid for both my kids weddings.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I agree with your mil, don't have a reception at a restaurant if you can't afford to pay for the food.|`|tBODwcqXaa	If they are there for you, you should really pay for them. You can tell them to keep it under a certain amount if you were worried about money.|`|1KfbgBupaa	I would never do this.  If you and your fiance aren't able to afford this small reception, you need to plan something that is within your budget.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If I received an invitation to a wedding where I had to pay for my own meal, I would not attend the reception and I would give them a $10 gift card to somewhere like K-Mart.|`|sMgwk0jlaa	I think it depends on what kind of family you have.    I would probably pay if it were my wedding, but some call me old fashioned.      Have a good marriage/union!|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Well, here's the thing. It's not you average traditional wedding and I take it the reason you are doing it this way is because you can't afford a big wedding or maybe you don't want one. Either way if it is only family then I am sure if you worded it right and maybe said after the ceremony we are not having a reception but I would like everyone to get together for dinner at_______. And maybe somehow let everyone know that they will have to pay their way. If not maybe have a gathering at a family members house and make it covered dish. That way everyone can do the whole meet and greet and the whole covered dish thing will actually be a conversation starter for folks that don't know each other. People will always ask" wow, that is good, what's in it?" Or maybe if your "mother in law" thinks it is so rude maybe she can help you with the dinner bill?|`|YSPbrrYfaa	I think you should just try to come up with a way to save some extra cash and go ahead and pay for your guests. With 30 guests at around $30 a person (which is generous), that's around $1000. By August, I don't think it would be too hard to save up that much.  Plus think about the fact that your guests will probably bring you wedding gifts to start your new life together. Bringing a gift and then having to pay for their own dinner seems a bit off.    Or if you're worried about guests spending too much since they aren't having to pay for it (think appetizers, expensive main dishes, multiple alcoholic drinks, etc.) maybe you could talk to the restaurant and see if you could get a special menu printed up with only a few choices within your budget.|`|5iL7gqAGaa	Sorry  but in my opinion yes it is. No one ill wanna go if you make them pay and even if they do go they won't eat. The whole part of a wedding is for the guests to enjoy and remember the wedding and you want that in a good way.So don't make them pay cause no one will come! I personally mostly go to weddings for enjoyment to be part of the ceremony wish them luck and to enjoy have fun and eat FREE delicious food so its VERY rude to have them payy! so don't mkayy?|`|F7O0nLK1aa	yeah, it is rude. instead do a buffet style, have the family member who enjoy cooking each make something and tell them that you'll accept it as your wedding gift.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I went to a wedding a few years ago, where the couple asked that instead of gifts, they had their guests to pay for their own meals instead.  I didn't have a problem with that, as the couple was not in the best financial position and this was a way for them to cut costs.    But as you have stated that not being able to afford the reception is not the issue, I would find it rude for you to expect people to pay for themselves.|`|iYWEwg0Maa	Well...  It's generally customary for the people getting married to pay for their reception.  I wouldn't expect to have to pay for my dinner, and if it were someone I wasn't REALLY close to, I might not go.  BUT since it's immediate family, I would go to dinner and have a good time!  There is ONE stipulation to this though: I would happily pay for my dinner if I knew that the bride and groom really didn't have the money for it, and there was no way for them to get the money for it, BUT if I thought they could reasonably afford it, I might think it was a little rude.  I have to be honest, it would effect the present I got them.  I normally give $100 to each of my friends who are getting married.  I do this because I know that it typically costs about $40 per person to attend a wedding.  If my new husband and I go to a wedding, it costs about $80 for us to be there, so I like to throw in the extra $20 as a sort of gift.  If I were to go to a wedding and had to pay for my own food and drinks, the bride and groom would get about a $20 gift.  And to be totally honest, I think that most people who had to pay for their own food and drinks would not give a gift at all.  I hope this doesn't sound rude or mean, I just wanted to be honest.  Regardless of what you choose to do, I hope your day is as beautiful, and special as you have imagined, and I hope that your families are all able to attend!!!  Good luck and congrats!!!!!!!!!|`|28WJwHf4aa	Yes, this is rude. I agree with your mother-in-law; I wouldn't go to a wedding that expected me to pay for my own meal.    The reason is, a reception is a party thrown by the bride and groom. It is a celebration of their wedding. Like any party (birthday, for example), you would provide food and drinks for your guests.    If money is the issue, do what my husband and I did. Starting 15 mos. prior to the wedding, we set up a savings account specifically to be used as a wedding fund. We decided on a set amount of money to be placed in it from each paycheck and we stuck to it. By the time our wedding came, we had it completely paid off, as well as the honeymoon, and still had money left over.    If you aren't able to set aside enough money for the reception you are planning, then plan it on a budget that is more reasonable for you. Have a backyard BBQ or a picnic-style type of dinner at a park. Or plan the ceremony so it is after dinner time, and then just have appetizers or cake available.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Yes i would consider it rude.  No one ever pays to go to a wedding!|`|iUisxJWzaa	God Yeah, You can't have guest paying for themselves. Its's extremly offensive and believe me although your having a small wedding its going to get a whole lot smaller once guest have to pay for their own meal. Since you know exactly how many guest your going to have why don't you ask for a set menu with a flat rate price.     What ever you do don't have guest paying for their food and buying their own liquor.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Sorry, Hon, it is very rude to invite a person to a celebration of any kind then expect them to pay for their food, unless it's a pot luck affair...and weddings are no exception. How would you feel if you were invited to a wedding then told 'Oh, BTW, you will need to pay for your meal, and it's 100.00 per plate." , That one top of the coast of travel, the wedding & shower gifts, and new outfit you need to purchase.Most people would be mildly insulted and would not attend.Or would tell you it's fine but they won't be able to afford a wedding gift if they pay for their meal.    Don't shoot yourself in the foot....have the wedding you can afford and don;t expect your guests to pay for a party you are throwing. Good Luck.|`|WipP42SVaa	Now asking guests to pay for their own food at a wedding is just tacky.  How would you feel if the situation were reversed? i know i would find it impertinent if i received an invitation like this. if you can afford it but want to save money why not have a buffet instead and serve you wedding cake as dessert? why else would you want them to pay themselves in the first place?
3zm0jA0yaa	I am really afraid for you and your parents and friends are probably also.  A man with a temper like that only gets worse the longer you are with them. I have never heard of a man getting mad during  sex. That is extreme. I wouldn't call what he is doing hot tempered. I call it out of control. and with all  men like that it is only a matter of time  before you get the bad end of that temper.Your friends and family can see disaster coming, but you think you are in love with him and you either can't see it or you are refusing to see it, but ignoring it don't make it go away. You will have to face it soon or later. and once he hits you no amount of romantic gestures will fix it. Abusive men are notorious for being so sorry or doing things to supposedly make up for their out of control behavior. But only a fool will accept that. I have to assume this is your first esperience with an abusive man. All  men who are abusive have the same profile. He seems to fit it just fine. I don't blame your friends or family for not liking him. They see something you don't / instead of you seeing things they don't about him.He is just fooling you. I just wish you luck and protection from this man. What makes him SO DANGEROUS is that he is a cop, and it is very well known, that once he hits you,  he knows how to use the law to protect him and he will. They law and all his buddies will be on his side. I see something so terrible in your future with this man and you say all the same things that women in abusive relationships do. "They don't know the real him"-They tell me I could do better but he is amazing and I love him!'- He put his hand thru the wall and he didn't hit me" and whats so bad is deep down you know it but are refusing to see it. He grew up in an abusive home-his brother is an addict- all things are herititary( spelling?) My wish is for you to have an open mind and sit down and listen to your family and friends and see what it is they have to say about him. They have insight into things you can't see right now, and are just trying to protect you. You should listen to them. They are the ones who truely love you and want the best for you. Good Luck, I think your going to need it.|`|A7lghafHaa	he obvioulsy has rage issues (think HULK) and NEEDS TO SEEK A PROFESSIONAL  you are in serious trouble  if you dont move out and away he will eventually beat you  then what r u gonna do?  youll leave hell stalk you and .....  you deserve better  but the ironic thing is you dont get that  what would you tell a friend if she was in the same palce as you?|`|FplTPoAyaa	His temper will only get worse when you marry.  Whatever faults he has now will not go away.  NEVER marry a cop. They have a God complex and think that they are above the law. If there is tension now, just wait.  Trust me, girl, it WILL get worse. Don't marry him. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I've been there.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Why do women always feel like they have to fix someone?  Why don't you take time away until he gets himself under control?  There is no reason you have to put up with this behavior.  You don't deserve it.  He has some personal issues to work through and he has to do it for himself, why should you be his whipping post?  His profession has nothing to do with this.  Being a cop doesn't justify being an @ss to people.  I bet if everyone quit trying to talk you out of this relationship you'd stop trying to prove to them they are wrong and you would start seeing him for how he really is.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Honey, you are a classic case of a woman about to become a victim of abuse.  Maybe not before the marriage, but almost certainly after it, when his twisted brain somehow conjures up the notion that he is "entitled" to hit you.  I'd say that virtually every woman who has been abused would describe their significant other the same way you have described him.  He lacks normal control over his anger, and is a truly dangerous person to be around.    Run, girl, RUN|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Hun that is NOT normal... He will turn his anger around on you so fast your head will spin. And that will be AFTER you are married to him. Anyone on the "outside looking in" aka us, the Y!A community, can see that. Your family can see it. He's comfortable enough with his fits that he does it at WORK? Something is wrong there. Really... I'm very serious when I say this does not look good and it's a much more serious problem than you realize. Cocky men like that don't care about anyone other than themselves. And the man who said he'll feel entitled to hit you after marriage is absolutely right. There are better men out there. My husband would never in a million years do the things that you are saying your fiance does. I "get" that otherwise he is a great man. Aren't they all? Be careful... I have a feeling with all the nice things you said about him that you won't be leaving.|`|bO2rzfISaa	This is the third day in a row you've posted this question. It's a violation of Community Guidelines to post the same question over and over. What answer do you want?    Your friends don't like your boyfriend because they know there's something off about him. He was raised by an abusive father, and I think he will go on to abuse you if you marry him. I mean hit you, because he's already abusing you.Look into the Cycle of Domestic Violence. It's common for abusers to do something really romantic after they abuse. The fact that he's a cop and he's abusing you is terrifying. You will never get away from him after he starts hitting you.    You don't see the real him, you see the person he's pretending to be to trap you. You are in a very dangerous situation, and you should break up with him.    800.799.SAFE Domestic Violence Hotline|`|4WOCDS9taa	cops are always hot headed sweetie, some times u just gotta take the gud with the bad, just remeber y u luv him!|`|0rpS2b97aa	Ultimately, he needs some help.  It is never OK to get mad enough to put your fist through a wall.  This could stem from his previous family life, but it is never an excuse.  The important thing is that he never harm you in any way.  I have a hard time imagining him as you have described without him being controlling to some extent.  I would see it as a problem.  This may be your family / friends idea too.  If it is a problem now, it will not go away on its own.  He needs to know how you feel and should care about you enough to correct his actions or get some help.|`|RtmfVevbaa	Sounds like a bit of a control freak, most police officers are, simply because all we can attempt too control is our own lives and the people in it! He sounds like he could be abusive, if he is having unprovoked violent outbursts, he needs to get help, which is free and strictly private! You may be blind to what others see of him when you are not around, plus because you love him so, but he may have a darker side! If he has a temper like that, he may not be employed with NYPD, despite what people think, they have zero tolerance for abusive officers!!!!
0qLJXy3Zaa	lol take a breather. just talk to her!    if you wanna talk more im me. i'm not on aim now cause my comp is broken and prob will be for a bit longer but when it's fixed i'll be back on- message me sometime. jennyssoasian.    ps. you're cute:)|`|ZyvJEA1Naa	Whatever it is you say to her, I hope it's nothing like the garbled slur you wrote.|`|YNC6qeJaaa	Talk about a run-on sentence. Have you ever heard of a period (".")??|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Tell her she's pretty and ask her for her phone number ?
mcUSz16kaa	Wow, your life almost sounds like mine when I was your age.     No, love/relationships are not necessary, but it's a nice feeling. If you are an Asexual type, so what. You are what you are and nobody can change you or how you feel.      Here are a few tidbits that I find helpful if you feel you need some support.     1. Don't worry about not having a relationship. Love will come naturally when you are ready (Asexual or not)    2. Keep dating yourself to stay happy, by scrolling to  3 .     3. Don't forget to make yourself a priorty -Take care of your health, do the things you love, spend time with friends and challenge yourself (find another major that's fun). My major was Fashion Merchandising/Minor Interior Design..I also took a lot of other classes that interested me outside my major. Did I follow through in landing the greatest job of my life & making huge big salary bucks..Nope..I took them because they were fun to take, and because I had to in order to get my degree of course..Now, I'm an office manager and I really like what I'm doing.  Anyway, making yourself a priority ensures that you're happy whether you're in a relationship or not.     4. Even though you believe you have an overbearing mom, let your mom be your mom..She is just showing that she is there for you and   cares for you deeply.  After all, you are her daughter. She is also just nurturing and protecting you since that's how us females were brought up to do back in the stone age days.  However, there are ways to tell her to back off without being direct so it won't turn into an arguement (that is if you want her to back off). Have patience and just keep on thanking her for her help and ideas and let her know that you understand that she is helping you. Also, let her know that you need to do whatever it is by yourself in some way that doesn't turn into an arguement. You may want to use a controlled confident toned voice that is neither defensive or angry (no drama).  Sooner or later she will back off and get the hint.               Good luck!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Relax and take a deep breath.  You don't have to have it all figured out at 21.   That's the beauty of youth.  Go ahead and finish school.  It would be a shame not to with only one year left.  If you want to do something else, continue your education.  There's nothing that says you can't have another degree.  If you still aren't sure about your path after graduation, take a crappy job and save some money to go tour another continent for a little while.  It will all come together for you in time.  Don't worry about relationships either.  That will come or it won't.  You may not always feel the way you do now, so don't close any doors but don't worry about it either.  We're born to evolve.  If we ever stop changing we become worthless, to ourselves if not society.  I think you're letting yourself get a little overwhelmed and possibly a tad depressed about it all right now.  Life is there to be lived, so get out there and do it and stop worrying so much about it.|`|QcG71AOmaa	to answer your question: no you dont need a relationship to be happy. alot of people get along just fine without being with anyone. besides being single gives you more freedom. people only make it seem like you cant be happy without dating because that person has come dependent on being with someone else and feel like if they are alone then their life is miserable when its perfectly fine and the sadness and depression is all in their head and they portray it through actions and words an silly comments. if u are content with the way your life is going right now then dont change it. if u are at a confusing point in your life then its best you just try to figure out what it is you want out of life then go an do it cause like you said we are all going to die one day [[negative but realistic no the less]] and your suppose to just live you life and have all the fun you possibly can doing whatever it is that YOU want to do. As for your mother i dont know how to help you there, just try telling her that you are a young adult now and that you are trying to do things on your own an that you thank her for her suggestions even if you dont cause its will make her feel better :) but yes thats alot an it thought i wouldnt say that much but i hope this helps you figure out things.|`|u2xm5RoQaa	eh..you have a bunch of good points, as of school. yeah dont drop out i only have hs degree and i want more education.but hey if you dont know what you want work at different places and see what you like the best.who knows you may can open up your own business which would be cool. but take a walk or hike and enjoy nature and find out what makes you happy in life and go for it.as for your relationship paragraph its spoken like a true single person.lol. i do agree with you but in a different way. im 23f and i would watch tv movies and everything and thought love was like a fairytale and some prince would rescue me and wed live happily ever after.i for 1 will voutch that its no where near like that. and think about it if we were ment to be alone why did god create adam and eve. we as humans where ment to have life mates.and i do agree alot of people get in relationships for the wrong reasons.as for you just becareful with yours, but i'll give you a homework assignment.lol.yeah. i want you to save this question.print it or save it and never look at it,until 1 year after you get married. you will have a totally different perspect on life that you'll wonder i use to think of this.lol.and finally as for your mom,i dont want to guilt trip you but mines dead,so please she may be overbearing but she just wants whats best for you.i know that you know that.my dads like that with me.have fun with life do more activities,go on more walks, you'll never know where it might lead you someday.
2JSIKsP7aa	sometimes|`|4WOCDS9taa	yah|`|bUuzuBOCaa	yes you should not be doing it      MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|dSMb8JDvaa	If your plans are changed, you should do some thing else suitable for a new plans, right? Or you right..your plans are changed and you don't have to change a new plans so you should not be doing it, yeah.(confuse?)|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Plans or just ... well, ... ummm  ... PLANS  Reality intrudes, sometimes, and forces revision of plans  As Robert Burns (the Scottish poet) said ""The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley."  Plans "set in concrete" are doomed to failure; the key to success in any endeavor is flexibility.  Plans give you a starting point and are useful.  Disappointments are not omens.
Uhyu3iCbaa	While the color scheme sounds lovely and cheerful, you may want to tone it down by having white tablecloths and alternating between different colored runners.  Blue runner on one table, yellow on the next.  Maybe the vases could have flowers of the opposite shade-- blue flowers on a yellow runner and vice versa.     Don't be afraid to add color to your wedding, though.  I had two bridesmaids and had one girl wear canary yellow and the other in watermelon pink.  It was unusual, but they looked gorgeous and I'm so glad I did it the way I wanted.  Make sure you do it the way that makes you most comfortable.|`|tBODwcqXaa	These colors are so popular right now. But I would suggest having blue tablecloths on the guests' tables and yellow on your own and the bridal party's. That way, both colors are incorporated without being "tacky." And PS: tell your sister she is just jealous! Good luck :)|`|1KfbgBupaa	It's your wedding and if you like the table colors, stick with them.  I watch many of the weddding shows on TV and very seldom does the bride use white tablecloths.  Your sister can use them when she gets married.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	I think it sounds pretty.  The flowers will tie it all together.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Honestly i think its a pretty thing to do to tables as well, my tables will be blue and silver alternating which one is on top throught out the place, i say go for it. its your wedding and your day so you want to be happy with how everything looks|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I immediately agree with your sister. Colored tablecloths are tacky. White is always the way to go, and plus it will make your centrepieces pop with color-- in a good way.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	I would say chose whatever you want.  If you say that it was beautiful, then I take your word for it.  If you think it may be a little over the top, then just have a ivory or white table cloth with the yellow table runner.    But what the heck, you be the judge!|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	loving or not loving your color combo is something only you can decide on. Your sisters opinion of colored table cloths being tacky in general is a load of crap. A lot of nicer weddings stay away from white. Personally, I think the the typical white table clothes that are usually offered from vendors look cheap. I think one of the best ways to make an impact at your wedding without spending an arm and a leg is to have more luxurious tablecloths. If you are doing those colors, personally I would stay in a muted toned family - don't do bright blue and bright yellow. Stay with a paler family and upgrade the fabric to a non-cotton. . . maybe a crushed or pintucked fabric.      Oh, and the flowers sound lovely.|`|IRH71dwIaa	I don't think so, the tablecloths and flowers match your weddings colors/ theme. Not everyone has plain white tables clothes for their wedding. Just look at the many bridal magazines out there. Anyway it is your wedding, so if you like it go for it :)|`|5iL7gqAGaa	i think it would be a BIT teency weency bit tacky but hey its your big day who gives a **** about what others think. This day if suppose to be all youh who gives a damn about yo sisters opinion if you like it stick with it. on my wedding if my sister said that for eg pink and yellow dont look nice i wouldnt give a damn! so what do you think? stick with YOUR feelings!|`|cU0EJVBdaa	well i think your sister is just giving you her opinion  but this is your wedding you do what you want  i think they are a little bit on the tacky side but that is just my opinion  if you want lots of blue and yellow  have lots of blue and yellow fresh flowers..  BUT ..you do what you want its your big day and you should not care what other people htink anyway|`|iYWEwg0Maa	I LOVE the idea of the blue and yellow table cloths!  It sounds very modern!  I watch all of the bridal shows, and I'm so sick of white tablecloths!  Have a white table cloth in your linen drawer after you're married, but this is your WEDDING- so it however YOU like it!  It's the ONE event you get to put together that is all YOUR design!  I think it would look great- AS LONG AS you're using LINENS, NOT PLASTIC TABLECLOTHS!  To be honest, plastic looks tacky no matter what, but when you add color to it, it goes to a whole new level!  Now, if you're concerned about it being too bold, (which I don't think you should be, but it's your wedding), then go with the blue tablecloths and a white runner to keep it toned down a little, then accent cake, gift, place card tables by giving them yellow tablecloths and white runners.  One more thing: If you do colored tablecloths, then you might want to go with white flowers.  If you make the tablecloths and the flowers the same color, it might look too matchy-matchy.  To give good contrast, modernization, and keep with the elegance of the wedding, you might try using the blue tablecloth, a white runner, and yellow and white flowers.  That way your colors are incorporated into all the tables without being too loud.  You could also stick with the blue tablecloth, yellow runner, and use white flowers.  You could accent the flowers with blue and yellow, but I would keep them primarily white if you're using colored tablecloths and runners.  If you want to keep the blue and yellow flowers, then you might take your sister's advice, and switch the tablecloths if you feel insecure.  Personally though, I would remind myself that it's MY wedding, and MY decision!  I got married 1 1/2 weeks ago, and my sister hated half of what I did, but the guests LOVED it, and I got TONS of compliments from everyone, even people who weren't even there, and just saw the pictures!  One man's trash is another man's treasure!|`|28WJwHf4aa	I don't think it's tacky at all. And if it's what you want, and think is beautiful, then by all means! It is your wedding afterall; not your sister's. And honestly, one of the last things guests are going to comment on is whether the linens go well with each other or not.     If you think it will be a little "overwhelming" having every table being colored, you could also mix in some tables that have the white linens with the canary table runner. You may also want to stick with one color of flower mixed with some white ones at each table (you can still alternate colors to have both).|`|4n69GRxoaa	i think you should go with colors you picked as long as you like it and so does the groom that is all that matters what the two of you want it is your day do it your way|`|H9WbaFeNaa	I think that they will look very nice.    One thought: nobody is going to remember what it's all going to look like, so pick what you like.  They're only going to remember the cake and food (and possibly alcohol).
8yE2sYGeaa	I am very happy for you. it sounds like you have a real prince of a husband.    i tried to get my wife over here to answer this question, but she is watching "Bones" and I would need a backhoe to dislodge her from that.    But she would never answer this question. I feel that i have failed to reach her expectations of what a father, a husband and a friend should be. Why do you think I am here?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I love everything about my husband.    I love his kind and loving heart,how respectful he is,his beautiful blue eyes,how affectionate he has always been with me with lots of hugs,kisses and cuddling,he has always be faithful,he has always been very supportive and there for me when i need him,how caring he is,how hard working he is,how he helps others when they need help,how he makes me feel so safe in his arms,how he treats me so wonderfully.    He is my best friend and i love him more then anything and couldnt imagine my life without him in it.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	i love that he totally respects me.he is the best father to our 9 month old. he tells me every day how much he loves me.if we fight he remembers that we will fix it and never says anything hurtful that i will think about later. he has never once looked at another women or made me feel insecure.when i was pregnant he made me feel like the most beautiful women in the world.he stands up for what is right no matter what is cool.he has added to my life what no one else could until our son arrived,true and undying love.he is the kind of man all of my friends want.he is the kind of man women dream about.he opens doors,caries my purse,brings in the grocery's, and does all household chores without being asked.he tends the baby at night and changes him by day.and when i kneed him he is there. that is what i love about my husband.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	First of all. I am happy that you are happy = )     I love everything about my husband - he is a good guy who is always looking out for me and my best interest.

It is nice to hear positive story. Gives everybody hope.|`|CYjrHrmAaa	haha I'm bored too so I'll answer.    My husband is awesome. We met when I was 16, became friends and got even closer (as friends) over the next 3 years...and then things just kind of happened. Next thing I know I'm a month away from my 27th birthday and we're getting married. lol  We've been through a lot of tough times together as friends and as a couple through out the years and it only made our relationship stronger. Our personalities are totally different and we basically balance each other out.   We put each other through school, he's supportive, he knows how to listen and communicate(won't hear yelling in this house!), he takes care of me, makes me laugh, cooks for me, gives me back/feet rubs every day, does things around house without me asking him, surprises me with random little presents or trips, watches crappy movies with me that he has no interest in seeing lol and so on and on and on.    And after all the years of knowing each other and being together, he still looks at me like no one but me exists.|`|BItkg1f0aa	that is way cute..ive been with mine for 4 years also but we are very very young..people tell me im too young to be married but they can lick my big toe...lol    anyway my husband is funny and fun, he makes me laugh all the time and i do the same for him..he is just amazing id say more but im feeding my daughter right now who is 3 months and looks just like her daddy, crapiest thing is i wish my husband could tell me that every day but unfortanatly he cant cuz hes in iraq..but one reason i love him is cause he looks at me like im beautiful, even when i look like a terd in the toilet lol...even though he cant now i know he would if he was home
rHjttxP6aa	hahah idk  depends on who ur talking about.   *cough cough*. haha|`|6f55018be55def6322ee6829868961afaa	I would say that there's no accounting for physical attraction.. and you'd do the same thing given someone that you simply couldn't resist. Admit it.|`|OUDXDNBLaa	You are her friend not her keeper.  It's a free world and she can date anyone she wants to.  Would you want your friend to be miserable rather than dating someone you hate?  That's pretty arrogant of you.  Would you leave the guy you love if your friend told you to?|`|7HtjBPkNaa	Happened to me.  I warned him about her, but he didn't listen.  I still remained friendly with him/stayed by his side, and eventually he got screwed over by her and learned his lesson.  I also had a massive crush on my best friend haha.    Just support your best friend with whatever their choices but make sure you let them know what they are getting themselves into-that is your duty as a best friend.|`|EyCgjjV4aa	PISSED.... and rightfully so.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	You cannot blame somebody for how they feel and you will lose that friend if you can't tolerate who they care for.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	If I were immature enough to have an enemy, I would be too immature to date or worry about who my friends date.|`|aMgmTN3zaa	I've kind of had this happen before.. and it sucks..  It doesn't feel good does it?? I felt like he stabbed me in the back and I hated it.. Little did I know that the "enemy" would be there for me when my "best friend" wasn't..   I'm sorry if you're going through this, but try to bear through it with your friend.. be there when they need you :)|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	I would realize that they were not really my really great best friend.|`|O14Jsf3Taa	Well to begin with, there's nothing you can do about it. If it was my friend, same story. I wouldn't like it, but I'd just have to deal with. Even if it means hardly hanging out as much. It would make me really uncomfortable to hang out with them both. And it will make you jealous when you recognize      that she is hanging out more, with this person whom you don't like. Just confront her about it, but don't do anything stupid.|`|CnQdSPLJaa	i would not be friends with her anymore
8yE2sYGeaa	Ask her an opinion.    "excuse me. Do you think a guy like me might like HJNTIY?

Just act natural and if you see a girl you like in the lobby go over and say hi. Ask her what movie she is going to.

eRg04AoEaa	If you haven't already tried just sitting her down & being respectful but honest about how you feel about this dance, then do that! Tradition is very important to mom's... I have an Italian family & the money dance was a big thing, I avoided it too, but my mom was more for the "money bed" where everyone goes to the house on the wedding night & leaves money on the bride/groom's bed. I had to really talk my mom & family out of doing this. Not that I didn't want the money, but I just felt like that was tacky & kind of gross. I just explained it to my mom & begged her to NOT do that. She was bummed because it's a HUGE tradition in my family, but she didn't push the idea at all. She understood. She & my dad paid for the entire wedding, I had nothing to donate & my in-laws were cheap, so they never offered a dime. But it still is you & your fiance's wedding, so it's really up to you guys!    Maybe you can come up with an alternative to the money dance. Is there another tradition or gimmick that your mother would like that you can compromise on? What if you do something similar to the money dance at an engagement party instead?|`|AA11082914	This is what I'm doing. The dollar dance is tradition in my family too, but a few months ago, I was leaning towards not having one, just because it sounds like I'm asking for money. I spoke to my aunt, and she suggested having the dollar dance for tradition sake, but have the DJ announce that the proceeds from the dollar dance are going to some charity. (I'm donating mine to the American Cancer Society- all 4 of my grandparents, plus 3 of my FH's died of cancer.) Suggest this to your mom- it's a win-win situation- your mom will get her dollar dance, you/your guests will know that you're not just looking for cash.|`|IHjevhjhaa	Promise you won't strip...    Hahaha, j/k...    Be upfront about it and let her know you don't want to do it. You should bluff and tell her that if you have too... You'll pay her half of the wedding. Thats how dead set you are about not doing the dollar dance.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	It doesn't matter if shes paying for half.Its not her day.She should respect your wishes no matter what.|`|tBODwcqXaa	The controlling mother or mother-in-law is a CLASSIC problem that brides have! But let me start by saying... there really is nothing trashy about the dollar dance. So many people do this on their wedding days and it actually gets more people on the dance floor. That being said, it is your wedding day... and if you dislike the idea, you shouldn't have to do it. But if your mother is paying for half, you also have to accept the (annoying) fact that she has some control. If you don't want her input, don't accept the money. It is better to have a budgeting wedding your way then an expensive wedding that you don't even want! Good luck.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	If you don't want a dollar dance don't have a dollar dance! She may be paying for half the bill but it is still your wedding and your day! Try to explain this to her and ask her is she would rather you be happy with "you"  wedding or she thinks she should be the happy one? sometimes people get to excited about the idea of helping plan an event they don't think about other peoples thoughts and feelings. Nothing against your mother. she must be a wonderful person to be paying so much money but it does not mean that she gets the say on your wedding! Do what you want! Good luck!|`|9hPnvmuzaa	Try to explain to your mother that she should be contributing because she care or know that you may need the help (whatever the case may be) and not to have control over the situation.    Oh...and cut the dance out completely =)|`|ba11762437a3276bc8acfec56128a271aa	I am getting married in 2 weeks, and I went back and forth about the dollar dance. Some said I should, others said it was trashy... I did lots of research on it and this is what I've come up with. Dollar dances CAN be fun. This is what we're doing, and what I would suggest for you. We are going to do our other dances, then give people time to dance and have a few drinks and socialize and everything, and then we will do the dollar dance. Also.. we are doing bride and groom dancing at the same time, so that everyone can get in on it. Maid of honor and best man will hold tubs to put the money into, and we picked one song and everyone has to fight to get to dance before the song is over. Some say you should choose several songs so that everyone can have a chance to dance with you, and thats when people start leaving. No one wants to feel like they have to sit there while you dance with who knows how many people for who knows how long. But if you make it like a race, and only play one song.. people have a lot of fun with it trying to beat out others. You dance with everyone for like a few seconds. Also, my soon to be hubby is military, so the proceeds are going to go to a wounded warriors fund and there are table cards saying so, but you certainly don't have to do that.|`|28WJwHf4aa	It honestly depends on the family and what is "the norm" for both sides.     Dollar dances are very much the norm for both my side of the family and my husband's side of the family. We held one and we were glad we did since it enabled us to have more one-on-one time with our guests. No one left because it came on...but we didn't do it right away. It was at about 9pm, and our dance started at 7pm. I think waiting to have the dollar dance is a better idea. Do both the groom and bride at the same time, and limit dancing time to 20-30 secs. Have the MOH and BM take the money and place it in a basket or saschel. Also, try to stay away from music that talks about money or dollars, etc., in it. Just pick some nice slow songs.    In the end though, it is ultimately your decision. For your mother to pin "Well, I am paying for it" on you is unfair of her. I would try to sit her down, tell her that while you appreciate her ideas on your wedding, you and your fiance have decided against doing a dollar dance (if that is what you choose).    Best of luck!|`|haCssg2Laa	aaah the joys of being a bride,      if i were in your shoes, I would tell you mom fine  and then, when it comes the time, and its announced  YOU stand up and tell everyone, that the money will be donated to xxxxx charity  your mom has her way, and you the bride saves face completely  AND  a charity will benefit    everyone is happy      you will have lots of run ins with your mom over your wedding since she obviously thinks because she is paying, that she has a say, not she is paying to give YOU the day you always dreamed of  so, i would pick your battles, as there will no doubt be others!  but i wish you all the best on your wedding day|`|VEi3R0craa	don't do it and remind her that she is only paying half next time she throws that at you.  I personally don't think the dance is tacky but I can't speak for all your guest and I am not trying to change your view point.  I think it really is a nice and fun way to spend a few moments with the bride|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	don't do it. even if she was paying for the entire wedding, you are still entitled to have or not have things you are set on, or against for that matter. don't do it... I agree that it is a little bit of a turn off. Your mother can, and will, get over it. Just explain your wants to her calmly and don;t let her turn it into an overly dramatic issue, it's not a big deal, and you are not a fan of the dance, so just put your foot down on this one. good luck, and congrats!|`|AA12113490	my husband's cousin did this at her wedding and everyone has a ball u took a shot of something that u wanted to to drink then paid ur dollar then dance everyone joined in i was so much fun|`|ycXsmCetaa	A couple thoughts--I didn't do it at my wedding, but have seen many who do and have not found it off putting.  In my opinion it goes over much better when the couple is quite young and not established.  A couple of professionals, maybe not.    Yet I understand the cultural connection.  How would you feel about a compromise where you do the dollar dance with an announcement that the dollars will go to a favorite charity?  Mom gets her dance, you don't feel like your asking for a hand out.|`|j5q5J8SPaa	first of all i dont think its trashy. But what it really comes down to is what you really want. if its tradition then your family will be expecting it so it wouldnt feel tacky to them.  you can explain to your fiances family that its a cultural tradition. They should more than understand. but it also depends on how formal your wedding is going to be. If its a formal affair then i could see it being a little out of place. I think the charity idea is a good compromise or a wishing tree or box is also good. Don't let your mom hold money over your head though. She wont stay mad at you forever but your wedding is a one time thing (at least in theory). you dont want that memory tarnished by a few minutes of discomfort because you gave in to some thing you really didnt want. Just respectably say no.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	Be honest with your mum and tell her that it is not appropriate and that you are not comfortable with doing the dance, as your in-laws family would be very unhappy with this.    Good luck with your wedding|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I agree with the others. I don't care if she was paying for the entire wedding (I know she is only paying for half). You're the one that would have to do the dancing. If it is not what you want to do, you need to voice that to your mother and stick to it. And I don't know how you could make a dollar dance less trashy; it's trashy.|`|Berx82h6aa	Hey Megan, I completely agree with you! I never recommend the dollar dance at weddings to our brides. It can be considered tacky to some guests, however there are other alternatives to make it more unique. The great thing about planning a wedding is that there is no right or wrong way to personalize your wedding. Think of making it non-cook cutter :)    I had a bride last year who had the same dilemma as you. Her mother wanted the dance (since it is considered an old tradition), and the bride was not thrilled about the whole idea. Instead they did the dollar dance and donated all proceeds to their favorite charitable organization. Think outside the box and I am sure you will find the perfect solution.    Good luck and congratulations!  http://encorepartydjs.weblog.com|`|z9st8cLvaa	I've seen dollar dances made into competitions, where the bride and groom both dance with their respective people, and at the end, whoever danced with the least amount of people had to send out the thank you notes.  It was pretty cute.  Maybe you could do something like that, but instead of guests actually paying a dollar, you could just keep a tally?      That might completely defeat the cultural significance of the dollar dance that your mom has, but it might be worth a try to compromise.|`|hkwBR1moaa	The money dance where I live is a very common thing.  IT used to be just the bride doing the money dance but now sometimes the groom dances too.  Most guests expect it now and look forward to it.  The guests aren't required to give money to dance so it's alright.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	the dollar dance is part of your family's culture and will be expected by your family members.    the people who object to the dollar dance are upset with the ones who are taking traditions from someone else's culture and using it because it means they get more money.    Don't worry about having the dance.  If it makes your mom happy, then let her have it.|`|MLFBsZnUaa	Maybe you could come to some sort of compromise with her. (Though, really, it is your day, regardless of who is paying and you should be able to have it the way you want it.) Anyway, if it's the thought of people paying to dance with you n your soon to be husband that seems trashy to you, then why not have them do/give something else? Just as their best wishes or some sort of collection of nice little comments or something of the sort that they would like to give to you and your new husband. Hope that helped!
yptfd3sIaa	When you see the wine glass (or whatever) being pulled from the cabinet, quickly tidy up any of YOUR mess lying around, gather it and take it up to your room and hang out there. Listen to music kinda quietly, do your homework, and mind your own business. If she brings her rotten disposition to your room, ignore her as best you can. If she does this repeatedly, you need to talk to her about this unacceptable behavior when she's not drinking. If she doesn't seem interested in what you have to say, throw in a little "I'm going to talk to my school counselor about this tomorrow." And then, my dear, her ears should be w-i-d-e open. Magic.|`|y43tzOQlaa	I believe there might be a couple of things you can do that might help. First try writing down what she say's and when she says it, talk to her and show it to her when things are come and maybe with a third party there, better someone who is not going to pick sides. Another, if you have a cell phone that records, without her knowing if you know it's coming record her, it's amazing how people react when they hear themselves or see themselves acting a fool. No one has the right to be-little a person or make a child feel like they are less than equal. You have the right to be heard.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Justina,  Both my parents were alcoholics and they beat me half to death.  Being ugly and discouraging was a way of life to them.  Butchering my self esteem was their favorite past time.    Moral: Be more careful who you chose as parents next time.  Meanwhile, avoid confrontation and understand your mother is really voicing her opinion about herself, whom she sees in your eyes.    You will be gone soon enough.  I doubt she will change if you confront her.  The rage she feels, and the alcohol, will drown out any reason she might possess when not in that condition.  It won't be easy.  Learn from her how not to act as a parent, and remember these lessons when you get the urge to drink.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Yes, you should talk to your mom and tell her how it makes you feel. Dialog is very important, so talk to her, tell her that it really bothers you and I am sure she will try to change.|`|hok3XwN1aa	your mom isnt physically hitting or hurting you buy mentally she is beating you up . talk to her when she is sober or talk to a school counseler or a teacher you trust this isnt your fault and you dont deserve to be treated like that.. im sorry hugs to you...
C6m2RTZjaa	it sounds like she does! if you do ask her out or on a date here are some tips:  1. do not be shy. girls likconfidencece!  2. look her straight in the eye. by doing this, she means you are serious.  3.ask her a simple question, like "what are you doing this weekend?" f she says nothing, then there is your opportunity to ask her!  4. ask her to go do something casual, like a movie or bowling.   5. dress nice. every girl likes a stylish man. :)  6. you could ask to pick her up, so that its more like a date instead of two friends.   7. maybe bring her a little gift, like a single rose, or something like that.     congratulations and i hope you have fun! :)|`|7xNlABgSaa	Wait until the end of the semester, b/c if you bring it out to her in the open and she doesn't like you, you're sitting my yourself like a loser for the rest of the semester, and you're out a friend and study partner.

Do something during the daytime so it's not as stressful. Dinner, movies, that kind of thing usually ads too much stress, especially if your trying to figure out if you guy's are just friends right now. You have to find out where you stand, she may like you allot too, or you may just be the best friend she never had, you never know until you try.

You're gf has her heart for you, and I'm pretty sure her heart won't change if you give her alot of the attention and affection she wants. Don't worry about her being taken.

I have faced such a situation and I can give u a tip or two.

But REMEMBER: Try to get as little blood on you, your clothing or anything that can trace back to you. Also try to do it with the least amount of cuts possible. If it get too messy its over.   Afterwords incinerate your clothes and leave the blade in a bucket of bleach over night.   As for your girl, well you an handle that how ever you see fit. She's YOUR girlfriend after all.

9GHhc9SBaa	1. That might not be true  2. If it is true and that he kept this from you it's either that:      a) He knows that the child could be a deal breaker and he doesn't want your relationship to end.      b) He doesn't know you enough to introduce you to his 1 year old daughter, he wants to be sure that his daughter will have a stable life without girlfriends barging in and out of it; he might be waiting to be sure that he can trust you, waiting to see if the relationship is strong enough to face this challenge.      c) He unfortunately doesn't see you as someone important enough to meet his daughter... (Don't take this badly if this is the case, it's normal for a father to put his child's safety before his relationships).    Okay now what you must do is confront him. If he really does have a child then you have to think this through very carefully; think of your feelings: do you love him enough to face this challenge together? are you okay with being the second girl in your man's life?   If you're okay with all of this now think of the child: will you be able to offer her comfort, help the father with her and most importantly will you give her the stability her father wanted for her in the first place?  Don't get involved in her life if you're not sure, don't get in the back out instantly, that would only be more hurtful for everybody...     Okay well I hope this helps; I'm also 17 and I used to date a 19 year old guy, to help you i tried to imagine the same situation and what you just read is what I came up with.  Rest is up to you. :)  Cheers, hope it'll be ok!|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	So the daughter probably scared you a little bit. If you really like him then you would keep getting to know him, open up to each other more so you develop trust.  But you need more communication, that's how you get deeper connection.  If you're not gonna be serious about the relationship he's not the guy for you. You don't want the drama. Leave it.|`|9vLJbiHeaa	its stupid of him to keep sucha big thing from you.  if you really liek him / verge of loving him then confront him and talk to him about it  if your not too sure about the realtionship then break it off  its not a little white lie its a big deal  either way you need to talk to him about it|`|AsFiWxhUaa	ask him about it. yes he should have been upfront with that information but if you really like him then i think you should try to work through it. best of luck!|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	You have only been going out with him for three months. If he wanted to tell you he would, and if it gets more serious he probably will. Most people dont want to let their kids meet the new girl for personal reasons. Just let him know you know and you would love to meet her one day.|`|AA10409227	If you've been dating this guy for 3 months, and especially if the two of you have bene intimate, and he hasn't told you about his child, I'd say this is not a guy you ought to hang around. What else is he not going to tell you? Didn't he think you'd find out? I wonder if he has a pattern of being dishonest, or is it just that he was worried you'd dump him?  I'd say you need to confront him. ALL good relationships are built on trust. If you can't trust him (and he you) then you've got nothing. Good Luck.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Well I wouldn't like it I know that!!! How can you or could you keep that a secret??? Is it more important that he find a date then to brag that he has a DAUGHTER??? Not good honey. MOVE ON!!!!!!!!!!! NO CHILD of mine would be a secret over someone. I would be proud to say I have a kid. Thats JUST WRONG!!!!!  HEY JKOOL>>>>>>> WHY IS THERE GUYS OUT THERE LIKE YOUTHAT LIKE TO TURN THEIR PROBLEMS ON OTHER PEOPLE????? Would you mind explaining that???? HE LIED!!!!!!!!   Shes complaining about HIM LIEING!!!!  Not that shes afraid of him having a daughter?????  God??? Why is it that some of you guys turn things around like you do???? Doesn't make any sense to me at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is his lie and now it's HER fault because he kied???? I just don't get it???? Learn to take some responsibilty when you FU*K UP???????|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Ask him straight up :)|`|0d4X54rMaa	this is not an honest guy  dump him now  who knows what else he has not told you|`|vRp9AqnNaa	i would confront him about it and don't let him give you any excuses, tell him you want him to be honest and open with you, or else there is no trust...|`|M0GoGVHXaa	Confront him about it. He should have told u, but that dont mean you have to break up with him... if it bothers you..then maybe you two need to talk   x|`|2q6JtPiBaa	jst ask him about it, it's probaly sumthing he shuld have told you but maybe its' sumthing tht never came up. ask him if its true and why he neva told you. and tht you feel tht he was nt totally honest with  you.|`|cq4ng6QLaa	Before you jump to conclusions ask him if he has a daugher you don't really know that for sure. You said that your friend told you but he didn't. But if he does have a daugher break up with him because your too young to be someones baby mama. wait until you have children of your own.|`|5Mc0HLesaa	ask him if it's true  and if it is and you're not comfortable with it  break up with him!|`|NqbBjS0raa	Because you are attractive to him, and something is wrong with his other relationship. Or he chooses to play the field anyway. I think you have to make a decision whether to continue this with what ever is going to come down. Crossroads choice and tag you are it......(Do you love him? even tougher choice!)|`|4WOCDS9taa	break up with him!!!|`|Mgk7Cjp2aa	ask him y he didn't tell u|`|xde0uuuBaa	Confront him about it. And if you don't mind the fact that he has a kid, move on with your lives and be happy. :)|`|SqA0vJWlaa	i know you may like him, but if you aren't ready to be a mom you shouldnt date him. plus you should confront him before you decide wat you want to do|`|ug1zEGViaa	approach him calmly about it. you're right to be angry/upset that he kept it a secret from you, but he might just not know how to tell you.|`|PdXuSUPpaa	these situation you need to be more care. first some time he migh have kept some tthing more secrets like other ladies too may have kep secret form you. and another thing what he will do if you marry him if he is ready to leave his kid then his love is not real couse a father can not hate his kid if he is ready then he is not a real man and he cont shoe real love too. so all the love he showd is act,|`|Y5qZCpl0aa	I'm in the same boat. I'm 17 he's 19 but he has a 4 year old daughter. He didn't lie to me about it but he didn't bring her around. All I can really say is he's kinda shady for not telling you. And I don't understand how he keeps her a secret does he not take care of her? If that's the case I'd run. Just remember girl that little girl is going no where. You def have a rocky situation on your hands. I'd just ask him confront him and hopefully he has a good reason!|`|VHyWzAvfaa	See if that thing about the daughter is really true.If yes,then ask him why he didn't tell you.He's been with you for 3 months so maybe that was his previous and he wanted to forget it.  Maybe you could get a DNA test if you are really anxious.  I suggest you leave him if he was so unfaithful,atleast it'll be a new start and you can find some other compatible guy.  Or think what you'd do if you were in his place or ask god if you believe in god.|`|c49f097d01e356f55e7d5b5573cd0fadaa	first of all , approach him calmly about it to find out how true your friend words can be .
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!    OK, you should have added the little bit about your family's willingness to contribute in the first place.....    Hmmm....you could go either way with this.  You could start getting prices on things as many people do not even realize the price of things.  But....there are always ways to cut down on those prices too!    Example:  A wedding cake bought from a grocery store will be much cheaper than a wedding cake from a bakery.      Invitations:  You can get boxed sets of invitations from places like Walmart, Target, Michaels, etc. and then do them yourself.  Much, much cheaper than going to a place and ordering them.    So....yes, I would get some prices and present them.  Also, possibly look into 2 options (i.e., a bakery cake AND a grocery store cake) or....a medium priced venue and a lower priced venue, etc., so then you will have options to present.    Good luck and I hope you have a beautiful day!|`|AA11312653	It would be gracious and adult for you and your FH to deal with own parents and find out what his/your parents are willing to do. Then plan within your means. Consider that the alternative of "Here Mommy and Daddy, this is what and won't you pay for it please please please" is a childlike attempt to blackmail and browbeat and wheedle your parents into "giving in" instead of maturely accepting the figure they name as within their means.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	You should talk to your families and see if they WANT to pay for anything.    If your old enough to be getting married you are old enough not to expect your parents to be footing the bill.  The "brides parents pay for the wedding" is an archaic sentiment from when a bride went from her parents home to her husband's home.    Get a general idea of what you want -- plan a budget -and if your family wants to help out then great, if not - then plan to pay for it yourself.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Nobody is obligated to pay for the wedding but the bride and groom themselves.  The old rule about the bride's family paying for the wedding is very old-fashioned, and most families don't abide by it any more.  It is common for both families to chip in whatever they feel comfortable with, but you shouldn't assume that your families are going to help at all financially.  Plan a wedding you and your fiance can comfortably afford on your own, and then if one or both families do wish to contribute, then you have more than you budgeted for, which is always nicer than having less, right?  Whatever you do, don't ask your families if they'll help pay, that's really rude.  You can just discuss the type of wedding you both would like, and maybe mention that you've created a budget, but then leave it at that.  If the families want to help pay, they'll offer.  If they don't mention it, that means they can't help you.|`|tBODwcqXaa	First of all, congratulations!   You don't need to have a list ready first. You need to ask them what they would be willing to chip in on either side then you'll have a budget. Then go through all your must-haves with your hubby-to-be and set aside money for those first. Good luck! Also, if you need tips on how to have a money-smart wedding, check this out: http://somethingbluebook.com/01/money-sm...
RnQFwIuUaa	You will just have to wait it out. Why don't you show her you don't care if she is mad (even though you do) and act like everything is ok. Talk to friends, laugh, have fun and pretend that you don't care if she is upset and acting hurtful. She is playing a game and making you twist in the wind at her leisure. Another way to go about it is to just ask her what the h is wrong. Good luck|`|6f55018be55def6322ee6829868961afaa	Well if you'd do all that for her then you are obviously not taking care of yourself and I'd liken you to a doormat. If she knows this then she's likely knowing your personality and using it to her advantage.  She may be upset.. just because she talks to other friends but ignores you doesn't mean she's not upset.. she's just not displaying it to them. She may simply be upset with you..that her doormat has folded up and left.|`|n2W3Pjf7aa	I don't think she's appreciating you very much. What I would is walk away for a while. Or you can ask friends of hers to ask her why she's doing it. But from my point of view, she is playing you.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	I agree with Mosaic, you have been a doormat.  Go on with your life without her.  She is not your friend if that is what she expects.  And unfortunately you have allowed her to expect this so think about that and find a new friend.  She is obviously selfish and self absorbed.
i15KoiJhaa	Start by telling them how very much you've appreciated their constant support of you during your divorce...    You and your Wife got married exceptionally young and both of you had a lot of growing to do... both of you probably made not so great choices and decisions due to youth, inexperience and the responsibility of a baby to care for... that is a lot to deal with for anyone little alone a 16 year old kid.    The great thing about Family is they always support you and are there for you... the bad thing about Family (and trust me I know, as I have a Sister that married and then remarried the same Man 3 times!) is that you are telling them when you're in a bad spot all the awful things about your mate as an avenue to vent... but what happens is even when YOU are ready to forgive and forget... your Family is still very upset and shaken about the situation you made privy to them.    Best thing I can tell you hun is be as honest with your Grandparents as you can, realize they are going to have some misgivings about the reconciliation (as they like you said, were with you during all the heartache) Explain to your Family that you realize that BOTH of you made mistakes in the marriage previously but the BOTH of you have grown and changed and have remarried and are working on your life together for yourselfs and for your Son.    They will find a way to understand... it might take them some time, and there may be some awkward moments... but as I said, I know how my Family felt about my Sister marrying the same Man 3 times, he also had made a lot of poor choices and decisions previously, but the 2 of them have proven to the Family that they are in a good place now and Family get togethers are great.    Hang in there|`|A7lghafHaa	sit them down  man up  and tell them striaght  get ready to duck|`|iG0nAZKGaa	I'd say tell them gradually,but do tell them they'd rather hear it from you,than some else.Good Luck....

If he really liked you, he would have shown you, he wouldn't have been able to keep away.    Sometimes, us girls do get ourselves all excited over something that turns out to be nothing, i'm afraid.  Just wishful thinking on our part  xx|`|0d4X54rMaa	you have to move on  there will be a lot of others  next time don't waist your time if it's not going to be serious  let this be a lesson in life|`|5r48jn7iaa	well if your really that hurt, talk to him and tell him how you really feel, or if its to painful to just be his friend, don't be his friend.|`|CLrMpEgTaa	i can feel how you feel. but honey there are things you can't change in this world i mean if doesn't want to be your lover don't go after him begging for it but just tell him that how do you feel about him and how much you care for him.just think if you leave him and go he will feel alone coz he looses his best friend try to talk to him if it doesn't don't go to push him fr it ok.if it is meant to be he will come to you don't worry.good luck and take care|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	your going to have to go through the process of getting over him.     try not letting it happen again if your seeing some one and not going out with them as a lot of times that situation does turn in to pain for one or the other.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	crying is normal, its all part of the grief process, but if someone doesn't love u, its best to accept it, and get some therapy, or some support system of others u can talk to about your feelings. its always important to let your feelings out, and never let the person who hurt u, know that they have. as it only makes u feel worse to know that they know your hurting and they don't care. in every-ones life this happens, actually it makes u a stronger person. i always believed that things definitely happen for a reason, and that although were hurting, that theres a reason that is often unknown to us. there will be other loves, this just wasn't the right one. i believe god chooses to close some doors because he knows whats best, and that its best to accept it and be thankful it turned out a breakup.|`|DtEnHza6aa	please don't cry..  I don't think I'm in the position to say this but..  well...  if he doesn't care about you..  then screw him..  I'm sure you'll find somebody else more special and someone who does care.|`|WwVHWz5saa	You'll get over him. Give it time, don't jump to the next guy. You feel like dying now, I know, and you won't belive when anyone says "you'll be fine" but you really will. You'll see (:|`|1wdcprkGaa	forget him there is way to many ppl out in this world to be stuck on someone foreva|`|sEwoF3ocaa	just forget him|`|Hwh7Brq9aa	get a big tub of ice cream, some old romace dvds, a box of tissues and just cry.     eventually you will find that you wont be able to cry any more and you will find that you will just feel more remorse then anything.|`|UsGF7haFaa	i know how you feel kind of my boyfriend broke up with me last monday becasue of his mom..i've tried to 4get him i have tried to erase the fun times we had i cant erase anything and it hurts so bad i aint even do anything to him or his mom but he was cryen he really wanted to be with me....just try to be happy do things that you like doing|`|BFm5eVAZaa	sweetie, i know its hard. trust me i was going out with this guy for ages! there's only 1 way to deal with it  1st you just have to forget about him  keep telling yourself screw him, because  if he left you in the 1st place, he wouldn't be worth   anything.  2nd listen to sad songs i know it makes u cry more, but it'll release pain and the feelings will go faster.  3rd get ur girls over, have girls night out on weekends that'll make you forget about him. i hope this helps  but lastly you just gotta NOT think about him, it WILL take a while  but eventually you'll  move on
rWnycDxOaa	Its a true point, however at McDonald's is something completely different to school, but i understand what you mean.

Any concerns do not be afraid to bring up.  I have 4 children and I am an involved parent but I make sure not to be bossy and alienate the teachers or school.  Instead, I am helpful and volunteer.|`|lM8kzsiPaa	Oh gee, I don't know, maybe because its the law?|`|AcmfbJVpaa	Absolutely never that my friend is why the kids of today are the way they are- and some mother like to make them and let someone  other than them   take care of them McDonals should call the cops wen that happens
XeR3oN0aaa	Perhaps you don't actually have loving feelings for both of them but just enjoy the company or certain traits in their personalities.  Try weighing the good stuff against the bad for each person.  If this Alex guy has a girlfriend like you said then be careful not to mess things up for him; (cliche i know) but if you really loved him you would want him to be happy.|`|kj15EmJSaa	Your life is pre-occupied with non-sense, and you sound like a dummy.  You are going to make a bad wife someday.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Get a grip on yourself; you're descending into hysterics.    You're capable of deciding what you want.  Spend time with either of them.  Try out a few dates.  But don't kid yourself (or us) into thinking you can't help yourself.

And if he is, if he isn't as bad as he sounds, then he will try and apologize.|`|44551a920ccef33b263da9ba1fcfb346aa	You deserve soo much better. I really hope you find it.|`|utJYCCvaaa	umm if you feel bad but don't want to be friends then just wait it will pass... but i wouldn't care a guy should be saying stuff like that to a girl he likes... unless hes trying to see how much you actually like him but thats cold... i would say move on.|`|li07DuSGaa	Send him a link to your question. that would show him u like him n ur sorry!|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Lol, Dont understand your real question here, but it seems you acted like every other girl in this world. =) I suggest you have a real hard talk with the guy, and you tell him that your sorry for being rude, and mean. I mean, you dont want to be friends with him anymore?....i'm confused. Lol. You women are so difficult. :-]|`|U6NMoWdRaa	Your story is too long, I didn't read it, but from the title I can deduce that you f***ed up before, and it happened again.|`|7ybUYnGCaa	i read it    probably all of the stuff you said was right, if he brought in his past girlfriends... dont worry, if he truely likes you then he'll put that stuff behind him|`|BPykW5OAaa	maybe you should just walk away from the past.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	aw, it'll be ok  just tell him that you are sorry and you didnt mean it  if i were you i'd tell him what you told us when u said u thought he didnt like u so u gave up, but u really did like him  if hes really likes you, he will forgive you  just say sorry and hope for the best|`|AA12258779	honestly, just tell him exactly how you feel.   don't hold anything back just because your afraid of what he'll think or say.  keeping things from ppl you care about is pretty dumb. but I know how you feel. :[  if he was/is a TRUE friend then he'd listen to what you have to say & care about how you feel.     just be blunt. :]|`|ldwl20W9aa	Yikes, been there.    Just tell him your reasoning.  Sorta like you told here.    Maybe he will understand he was hurting you.  By talking about his f**ks and ex's.    If he doesn't get it or care.  Then thats not your problem.  You told him and said sorry for blowing up and not talking about it.    Move on. (:|`|56XwyVW9aa	WHOA WHOA WHOA!!  Take a step back and RELAX! I feel you are making this way to complicated. Now, trust me I do understand how love can make you feel all jumbled up.    Go to the friend, that asked you if you like Jake and tell him that you did then and you STILL do now, but you got into a fight and you BOTH said things that you did not mean! Let them do some of the leg work and I will guess that Jake wants to talk to you also. If he did not like you then why did he hang out with you all of those times!    GOOD LUCK!|`|7l3gvv8Gaa	WELL IT'S HARD TO FORGET THE GUY U LIKE, IT' TAKES EVERTHING, U HAVE.THERE OTHER FISH IN THE SEA, YR. OWN AGE. DON'T WORRY OK.

Tell him why u said the things u did, apologize, and tell him how u feel about the relationship between u two. trust me it works, its scary to do, but it pays off big time.|`|AA11041500	Talk to him about it...maybe it didn't affect him as much as you thought it did. The worst that could happen is that he really does get mad at you, and in that case you already knew that in the first place. If he really is a good guy he would accept your apology. And then move on...if that is what you really want.|`|5bpQCx8eaa	Okay first if your feeling bad about this, I'd say you should just tell him how you feel. the truth, it works, really! tell him that you were into him but after this fight you feel differently, and if you ment what you said about him being a player you should bring it up agian saying something like you don't want to just become some girl on his record, but that you are sorry for fighting with him. Its clear that you feel for the guy and I understand how being in this situation feels its super lame. The best thing for you is going to be closer.|`|23N8HhXUaa	Come on , you just need a apologized to him.If you don`t want lost this friendship|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	If he likes you, he likes you. If you like him then tell him to stfu about his past relationship or whatsoever. I'm just saying but, I would've done the same thing too, but I will only tell him how I feel about him, not ***** at him, I just can't do that. Tell him that you like him, but if he doesn't feel the same way as you then you guys shouldn't see each other no more.

If it is really this bad then you may have to physically stay away from her.  Just because she is your mother doesn't make this treatment ok.  It is still abuse and you don't have to take it.

If this were me, I'd find somewhere far away to go to school even taking on student loans to pay for it myself just so I wouldn't owe her anything. She's your mom. She wants the best for you but the way she's doing it is all wrong. Is she always a ***** or does she want you in "high society" status? Sounds to me like she cares about what others think instead of what you want out of your own life. You are old enough to make your own decisions. Don't let her destroy your life. Learn from it and be stronger for it.
TDiRmT9daa	My dear Lilly if my husband wrote me a letter like that when his family turned on me, I would be proud of him and honored.    I think you are right: you are lucky to have him! He is a man of integrity and character who knows what his priorities are and you are most certainly one of them. You deserve to be.    We all come from dysfunctional families - some worse than others. Our parents are human and they make mistakes. The legacy gets passed on from generation to generation because children learn what they live. It takes a strong spirit to end the dysfunction and abuse by seeing it for what it is - a hurtful legacy. The strong refuse to pass it on and the weak make others hurt so they won't have to feel the pain.    Your husband is is strong.  Therefore so is your marriage and family! All the BEST!!!|`|jpI3EfGpaa	I would be interested to know exactly what was your part in this problem in the family.  Yes, what did you do?  Seems like there was a huge upset somewhere.   Your husband seems to be a good man and really wishes things could be different (re taking the children over etc. etc.).  Isn't there something you can do - help be the Peacemaker with his family?  Maybe you should all go on Dr. Phil? and sort it all out.    I was intrigued at what led to all these family problems and did have a quick look at your former posts.  I would be interested to know where it was that your m-in-law took the children without your authority.  Like was it so bad/dangerous whatever?  Also the sister in law obviously has a child with behavior problems and could be jealous of you with normal children or something and the m-in-law would side with the s-in-law (her daughter).  There seems to be so many unresolved issues here and you seem very sensible and worried about your husband's feelings in all of this.  Can you help mend some of these fences at all - like set up a meeting with the m-in-law and have an open discussion re all of this.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	it is awesome to know that u have an amazing husband as well.see ladies they r out there u just have to find them.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	So why are you showing everyone a PERSONAL letter your husband gave you.. and what is the question exactly|`|u2xm5RoQaa	oh come on you cant let us read this letter and not tell us what happened.come on. and you should tell us only cause this sort of letter should of been kept between you and him.so you gotta tell us what happened.|`|c1gnFE8Gaa	How could you do that to him putting his heartfelt words on the net like this,    What if I was to copy and paste it and email it to everyone I knew and then told them to do the same etc (not that I would)    My God Women grow a brain, I know you are proud of him but come on it takes a man alot to write like that and you have shown EVERYONE|`|dTIQdV91aa	Oh gawd,,,that was boring, I couldn't finish reading it.|`|rH33ty23aa	Why in the world would you post such a personal letter that was meant for only your eyes?

What IS your question?|`|6ji300csaa	Lily, I'm sure your aim was to show that most husbands can and do realize what a trial their families can be and usually are to their wives. I'm sure that you meant to show your husband and the situation in a positive light...that he finally understood that he shouldn't have let them be as cutting or nasty to you as they have apparently been.     I wouldn't have put his letter on the net for (LITERALLY) all the world to see (even anonymously). This is a personal matter between the two of you. It's a sacred thing. It's an appreciation letter to you from him letting you know that he thanks you for putting up with a lot of crap. But in the future, hug these little nuggets close to your heart and thank the good Lord that your husband feels able to entrust his heart to you. And please endeavor in the future to not put it out here like a cheap tabloid rag article.    And always remember...it's the little foxes that destroy the vine.

28WJwHf4aa	My husband made a speech for us, thanking our family and our guests. It was short, but it was very direct and meaningful. It was definitely under 2 mins.     If you're worried about being boring or taking up too much time, split the speeches up. What we did was have my mom do a welcome and thank you speech prior to the salad being served. Once the salad was served and starting to have that plate cleared, our best man gave his speech. After the main entree, the maid of honor gave hers. After dinner, my husband gave ours. It broke it up so our guests weren't forced to listen to 10-15 mins. of speeches.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	In order to ensure you do not bore people into a coma, keep it down to ONE page, double spaced.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Any more than 3 minutes and you are going to lose people. Choose one or two specific things that you want to convey and cut the rest. It's why God made personal, hand-written thank you cards.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Bottom line-- this is your day, and people will sit and listen to you as long as you need to talk. If you feel like you need to say these things, say them. But if you don't want to bore your guests, I would keep it to about 5 minutes MAX. 3 minutes would be best really. Remember that you are going to send thank you cards, and you could always say these things to people individually. But I would trim the 3 pages down for sure. No fluff :) Hope this helps. Congrats!|`|1KfbgBupaa	Write lovely, long thank you notes.  Keep speeches under 2 minutes.|`|AA11312653	If you don't hit oil after 2 minutes, stop boring. Sorry to be harsh and cut your moment in the spotlight short, but that kind of speech should be delivered privately to your loved ones. You might not believe how deeply uninterested anyone else will be in hearing you go on and on and on about how much you love your family. Think of this as a toast, not a dramatic monologue.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	I think the basic rule for any speech at a wedding (especially since there tends to be multiples) is the shorter, the better. Keep it sincere, simple, and sweet, but don't ramble on. People will appreciate it. Remember, your parents may love hearing you speak, but everyone else usually waits for the speeches to be over so the party can resume, haha. Have fun!    edit - keep in mind, you can thank them and talk to them in depth the night before at the rehearsal dinner when you give the their thank you gifts... keep it more personal and intimate. The speech time is not the only circumstance you have to thank your parents.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I would try to keep your speech to a maxium of five minutes.  All the weddings which I have gone to, and speeches which has gone longer than that, seems to drag on forever.  Especially as the speeches seem to come after people have had a few drinks.    Have a great wedding.

Don't try to be too provocative. A man will love you for who you are, not what your hinting you can blow away his physical needs with.    Find a cute nerd or geek. But one that isn't so glued to video games or extremely nerdy things. You can always change a boy into a man. Fix a guy up to your taste. But it takes patience.     Find a guy who wants Long term, even if you have to go to a dating site. It is worth it. Most men want sex.     And when you meet men, don't give in to kissing or sex right away. Love will wait for that stuff. The longer he waits, the more you know you have someone genuine|`|su2aRQSoaa	You need to relax and calm yourself in a way that can keep you that way for a long time.

Some girls don't have a problem with it but others have a BIG problem with it.    If you care about this girl, even a little bit, you'll tell her the truth and tell her soon before she makes any more of an emotional investment into this relationship.  Personally, if it was me.....it would be a deal breaker!  That's  not something I want or would agree to and if I ever found out from someone else, I would be furious and you wouldn't see me for dust!  I think that's one of the first things you should tell a girl you're interested in so she can nip it in the bud if she decides that's not what she wants.  To keep it from her would be most selfish of you|`|AA10743159	What makes you think she'll get angry, of course she will.

Is that horrible to say? I don't see her taking it well... I also think that if you have these feelings, you need to take a timeout and kind of figure out what you prefer and explore a little bit. She does have a right to know. If she finds out you're seeing a man behind her back, it will probably upset her very much.    I'm not sure if you've been bi in the past, or if you are starting to feel something for another man. So, I guess, if you're feeling something new you want to explore, you should let her go and go find out what's going on inside of you and what you want in a person.|`|AxkVvgBFaa	don't listen to Angelika J.  she's a liar!  women say they appreciate honesty so that you tell them the truth.  then it blows up horribly in your face when you do tell them and you think to yourself, "sh@t!  i knew i should have just lied."  and yes, you should have.      i can see your are leaning to the correct decision when you say "should she even be told."  no, she shouldn't.  how is that her business?  that's your relationship with another man.  she's not involved.  it's not her business in any way.    however, if you crack and decide to tell her, here's what you do.  you invite your male interest over and have him waiting in bed all sexy-like at your place.  then you bring her back with her prepared to have sex with you as usual and she'll be startled when there is a strange yet sensual and naked man lying on your bed.  she'll be creeped out at first big time and ask what the hell is going on.  you reply simply, "well baby, i'll give you one guess.  and here's a hint - he's not here for you......surprise!"    women love surprises.    cheers!    -The Mayor

His 2nd woman was a chick he worked with and he still works with her she is still sending home work applications and ideas for me everywhere she can think of even though we're divorced stupid cow she is .    The trust is never going to return to you and the hurt he is feeling will always be there he will always wonder what your doing where who with and yes I think you deserve to have spyware placed so he can track you your not trustworthy you've done it once nothing stopping you doing it again all that emotional effort you put into the affair could have been put into being his and only his you gave a part of your soul that should have only belonged to him your not very much in love with him your in guilt at being busted women who are truely "In LOVE" with their husband dont do what you did stop kidding yourself .|`|yXk5lJQXaa	i have been dealing with this issue for well over a year.(him doing it to me..)  to be honest, you can tell yourself  its over and u want to work it out, and you might even be able to make yourself believe it, but as soon as the "honeymoon" phase wears off in say a month, when you and your spouse get into a fight...u will run back to your "friend" ... then you will justify why it is ok to continue to talk...even telling yourself its just a friendship... ya...right. i myself tried everything you are doing, and didn't work for us either... i cannot let it go. it ruined my mairrage and i know personally i will never get that trust back, no matter how hard i want to.  it is always in the back of my head. i don't know about you, but mine fights to keep his "friendship" with her. they are coworkers. i find spyware very intriguing. i want to know whats going on when im asleep or at work. and yes, losing trust with my hubby makes me feel that spyware is an option and may be necessary...the only thing im frightened of is exactly what will i find...you reap what you sow...these are consequennces you take when you do stupid crap. if it is brought up continuously...it will never be let go or forgotten. either learn to deal with it and try to prove your self knowing it takes a very long time with you being on your best behavior to get back what you screwed up or move on. being on the side your husband is on...save his heart and mind and move on. i wish we did... its only harder the longer you put it off.|`|lyWSufFBaa	I honestly don't believe in emotional affairs.  That's something people have made up: My husband is talking to another woman online = emotional affair.  My wife and her coworker have gotten too close = emotional affair.  I think the whole "Emotional Affair" theory has been taken way out of context.  It may be considered inappropriate behavior and may lead to an affair but it's far from an affair in my eyes.  Sometimes people feel they can talk to, confide in, someone other then their spouse.  Right or Wrong, it happens.    Edit: More then likely sex is involved.

As much so as if the affair were physical.  Talk openly and honestly about it.  With maturity, with the goal of finding out what is going on, why he is doing it, what does he want, and how do you move on past this.|`|SzQi9N7daa	The only thing missing from an emotional affair is the Sex and, quite frankly, if your spouse is withholding being with you (sexually or together) the sexual portion of the affair isn't that far away.  If your spouse finds ways not to be around you or go places with you. If they avoid conversations other than meaningless chit chat, they are in an emotional affair.  That conflict of emotions can and does lead to a physical affair.  If they are not having sex with you its because their conflicted emotions now tell them its wrong to cheat on their "Friend" with you.    I sat my wife down and read her everything about affairs I had.  I showed her the evidence, including being unwittingly ratted out by her own child.  She still refused to admit she was having an affair.  Sorry hun when man, other than your husband, is groping your breasts and chiseling his initials in your tonsils with his tongue, its an affair.  When your on the phone at midnight with a man other than your husband, its an affair.  When say, he's coming, and your husband walks into the room and you suddenly hang up the phone, its an affair. When you tell your sister to meet you for lunch and your with another man, its an affair. When your confronted with insurmountable evidence and you bat your eyes and say its nothing, we're just friends.....THAT'S A LIE!    Having an affair and lying about it are deal breakers.      Just wait until they try to blame you for "forcing them" to have an affair. Everything that comes out of their mouth is either a lie or a pathetic excuse for lousy judgment (huge understatement) on their part.       Good Luck..

Further, long underwear, or gym pants and a sweatshirt are not that expensive.|`|bYU77eteaa	Get a 2 liter bottle (or 2 or 3) filled with HOT water and  place them at your feet and at your chest...fold your hands around the bottle and hold it to your chest   you might have to wake up in the middle of the night and refill it with hot water but it's worth it    you can also get an electric blanket and electric heating pads that you can place at your feet and chest.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	I use one of those electric oil heaters and put it right next to my bed and put my covers over the heater. Don't do this with a hearer that blows hot air|`|hok3XwN1aa	get those socks that have warming packs in them and put on extra socks.. sorry the economy is bad that we all have to cut back on heat and things we really need your mom is trying to keep your family afloat..|`|up6xgVsAaa	heaterrrrrrr|`|tf3Uebbuaa	wear thicker clothes...or i suggest you use other blankets..maybe the fleece one's arent that warm.  or you can get that mattress heater, where you put it on your bed and it heats up|`|RGPla7oQaa	a heating blanket works really great  and you can go to any place like walmart, target, rite aid, cvs, walgreens. ect and find one and the range in price but you can get a very nice one for not to exensive|`|2qpBBTakaa	Definitely wear warm pajamas and thick socks.  Also, I have a corn pad that I can heat in the microwave and use it to keep my feet warm.  Yes, it is a bag full of dried corn and you heat it for 3 minutes.  Like a heating pad.  You can also try electric blankets.|`|xB3YvQeVaa	Get some fabric and any kind of beans or flaz, make a bag out of the fabric and fill it with beans then put it in the microwave for 2:45s and it keeps u warm fur like 6 hours. U might be able to find one at the store. If not, how about a heating pad?|`|UgDOkQKKaa	i live in texas and the a/c dosent work in my room, so i have the opposite problem!! hahaha    take a REALLY hot shower b4 bed nd blow dry your hair.|`|L6cywARAaa	Wear clean socks to bed and put on another blanket.  Jog in one spot before jumping into bed...That will heat you up.|`|ou3TcHdmaa	lol i used to be in a similar situation, but then i got an electric blanket, and trust me, THEY WORK PERFECTLY!! =)     lol i hope that works for ya !
PXimiZCdaa	Yep, sometimes you have to let them go when its for the best, even if you love them.|`|L38M9lrLaa	yes = (|`|MSJEyhSJaa	I've had to break up with someone really early on when I didn't want to. Because he was my friends ex and she was really upset by us being together. Otherwise no.|`|ZL8ywCSYaa	Yes.  I still regret it and it's been over 5 years.|`|3VxmsXWoaa	nope. But I have had a lot of people available to me when I've been in a relationship with the person that I love. It's hard sometimes|`|r1IWKjFxaa	Yes, I just had to turn down a girl I had a crush on for 2 years and dated for 2 weeks because she stopped talking to me for 2 1/2 weeks.  She suddenly started acting like nothing happened after I had another girl visit me for 3 days.  She asked if I wanted to go on a date this weekend and I said no but I wouldn't mind hanging out =(|`|JLFGfaC3aa	Yeah... :/  It was for the best. You really never forget them, no matter how hard you try.|`|kdmGZn8taa	YES & it sucked.|`|tB14zSSnaa	Yes-he was too nice and said he'd wait for me forever  i rejected him because, the matter of the face is i liked some Tw*t who wasnt worth the time of day.  i really wish i didnt, he was so kinda, and i broke him >.|`|ldwl20W9aa	Yes.|`|wjhVO5tKaa	yeah i have... sucks cause i really liked her but when we dated it just seemed like she didnt have time for me of she was busy but when we were friends we were always hanging out... id rather be with her as a friend than not at all|`|AA11227589	yeah but was for my own good...|`|toQ3ZSKTaa	I have never, but for some reason I have always been the one rejected. I am always left for someone that is ignorant, has bad morals, does drugs...just an overall bad person. If you really and truly love someone you wouldn't have a reason to reject that person, on the contrary you would accept them.|`|3IlUOsp9aa	yes, sometimes the one you love is the one that hurts you the most.  I loved someone every much, then he because a really bad alcoholic and he blamed every single problem he had on me, then began to abuse me.  I loved him and I still think about him fro time to time but I had to let go and my life has bettered since.  I hope he finally got help and is doing better but I dont know how it turned out....|`|4N91sG5Iaa	yeah i have it was a pain dam once i was feelin him then it was end of storyy good luck|`|Z6Rppb8Aaa	my last bf and i went out for five years and i had my besties dump him for me. i look back on that day and i feel terrible but hes put the past behind him and now were just good friends|`|6gPTv8lOaa	no  cuzz to me it dosesnt make sense to blow away the one that u absoluley love.|`|pVz807wkaa	Oh the only thing I know that I will HAVE TO do it. Im dating a girl that I really love like it was never before. Everytime I look in her eyes I'm drowning... But I have to leave back home. And I know we have to break up - her place is here, mine is there. I was friqing crying... Yeah I think I can say yes|`|ycxB120aaa	yes..and it pains me up to this day...
M5XE0ycCaa	Well since it didnt happen I think you guys now need to focus on moving forward.    Moving forward means that some questions need to be answered.  You guys need to do what ever it takes.    Young marriages can be tough in so many ways.  Dont rule out councilling or anything like that.    I was married when I was 21 and my wife was 19.  We have now been married over 20 years.  trust me when I say things happened that could have caused either one of us to easily walk away.  However we decided to work through our problems and now years later we are so very happy that its even hard to remember some of the bad times.    read some great relationship articles at the site below|`|tOdjjeAmaa	It can be forgiven with time, but really if I were in your shoes I would give him an ultimatum- Go to marriage counseling. There are obviously issues with the relationship from his view. And like you said, it seems that to him cheating is an option. I think that if you do nothing about this, his behavior will continue.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	You are pretty straight forward person. It depends on you if you want to let it go, or kick his ***. Check on everything that he does, email, texts, school, work, phone calls. Good luck.|`|MNOZPQ8jaa	Yes, it's possible but you will have trust issues with him for a long time. I went through this last summer and it was a living hell.  I caught my husband talking to an old girlfriend on his cell.  She lived in another state and they never met up but his "emotional affair" almost destroyed us. You see, unlike you, I had no idea this was going on until I looked at his cell phone for a number one day and he had her programed into his contact list!  Whether it was right or wrong, I checked to see when he called her and how long they talked.  Also checked text messages. I found out more than I wanted to.  If he's trying to hide it from you then he knows it's wrong.  Hope you can make it work but I would advise you to keep a close eye on the situation.Maybe you can talk to him and find out why he feels the need to talk to this girl.   Good Luck.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Have a three way sexually and this will dramactically change the situation your mate is going thru flavor changes|`|QtaPF83iaa	Your right, since he took the steps that means he had in his mind that it's ok if you don't know.  He wasilling to lie to you so that tells you he's not above betrayal.  I'm not saying he's a bad person he's displaying what seems to be second nature to alot of people.  I think it can be forgiven only if he truly resents his actions and has asked for your forgiveness.  If he doesn't see anything wrong in what he did other than being caught, thats a pretty good clue that your gonna have to be playing detective for the rest of your marriage driving yourself crazy cuz you have no reason to trust him.  Easier said then done but (since you sound strong) you need to sit down with him and have a heart to heart to try and discover what his intentions of your marriage is.  I'm going through the same dilemma except i don't have as much proof or even a confession.  p.s. Moe is wise and put it clearly.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	I sounds like he's incredibly young and immature and really has no idea what he wants.  4 times he met with her, then he lied!!!!   Is he really going to change tonight and be a different person tomorrow???  No.  This sounds like who he is.|`|IxjSf6Liaa	Marriage is really tough sometimes. You may need to lay down some rules that apply to him and also yourself. You do need to approach this gently but firmly. I'm glad to hear that you both are still committed, but he needs to grow up and realise he has a wife now.He NEEDS to respect your feelings on this. If you can afford it maybe get marriage counselling.|`|6ji300csaa	Anything can be forgiven-everything ought to be forgiven. Forgiveness does not negate the need for decision making, though. You have a decision to make.    Sweetie, you guys are definitely in some choppy waters. You mentioned that the two of you are young and struggling. Part of this dalliance with the freshman has to do with the fact that he is still a young man who is apparently not used to having to struggle. The freshman girl is a reminder of his more carefree days and when he comes home to you and the struggles...he's reminded of all he's missing out on. Sometimes we do find the right people at the wrong time. The two of you may just be too young to weather all the demands that marriage makes. These are the times that make or break marriages.    I don't know if you've ever read the Bible, but it does say that if a man looks on a woman with lust..he's already committed adultery in his heart. I know you may not want to hear this, but your husband has already plotted and planned to do this in his mind...even if he hasn't had the opportunity to follow through on it---YET. What will the response be next time the pressure is applied? None of us can ever stop a loved one from being unfaithful, but we can control our responses. If the two of you want to figure out if your marriage is worth saving, please seek professional help.|`|8Oamp4VCaa	take it from someone whose g/f has "emotionally" cheated and lied on multiple occasions, trust is incredibly difficult to regain and you may always be wondering if it has gone on to the next level. it is hard to forgive someone when you have constant doubts. whether or not to forgive is your call. just because there was no sex doesn't mean you haven't been betrayed. i know how you feel. there was technically no affair, but.....
mYAbq6fnaa	well first, people act totally different online than they do in person. so she probably wasnt acting like herself anyway. cut all of the junk online and talk to this girl face to face.|`|fY9nkXZUaa	Delete her she is rude. BTW are you a girl|`|q29CEdkWaa	I didn't really understand your question, but it sounds like you need to just stop talking to her online and start talking to her in person. People are 10,000 times different online than they are in person, which could be part of it.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Sort it out, have a fight.    Then kiss and make up.
rVnTnuU1aa	I dont think so. My husband and i got married while he was on leave from the army in Kentucky. They grabbed two people in the office and they were the witnesses. Everything happened so quickly for that civil ceremony that if you blinked, i swear you would of missed the whole thing.|`|P8vt2aLhaa	You only need witnesses|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	You can, but you don't have to. We did it with just us and the clerk, but the couple after us did it with a small group of people.|`|NvzA9V8eaa	You don't need anyone to give rings in any wedding--that is just a formality done for ceremony    Technically, all you need for any wedding is the   officient  bride, groom  witnesses      all the witnesses have to do is sign-    technically you don't need rings--that is just ceremony--you could even use an elastic band or draw a ring with a sharpie and it would still be official as long as the paper is signed    its up to you-its a personal choice|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	It's not necessary but, if that's what you want you can have that.    It is required you have one witness.  We had my sister-in-law as my maid of honor.  She took our photos for us!  She signed as our witness.    I also invited my mom and grandpa.  They served as witnesses.  So, you have have people hand you things if you like.  Make sure you do have someone take pictures and have someone there you want to sign as a witness.  Also, don't forget the flowers!      Good luck!    Add-->  Like others said the rings are for show.  Make sure you sign the paper...that is what makes the marriage!  We exchanged our rings after our ceremony.|`|tBODwcqXaa	It is based on your preference. You don't need them but it's a great addition to any ceremony. Weddings are all about what the bride and groom want so keep that in mind. Good luck, and congratulations!
5PVFXry8aa	your family most likely wont agree with wether he changed or not since your so young (im 18 and getting married on feb. 20th to a soldier too:))  But if you really feel it can work then dont listen, eventually your parent wil have to come around, if he makes you happy, then go for it, in the end all that matters is your happiness.    My family disagreed with me that i was 18 and getting married they thought i was too young, but they knew i was happy and thats all that matters!!|`|7idLr1Rxaa	I got married when I was 18 and it was the best thing I ever did. I'm 22 now and we are still together and have never seperated or anything. The best advice I could give is to wait to have children until you are finished with college. It is fun to be young and married. You can go out together and party and hang out. But when you have a baby you are doomed to stay home forever regardless if you are married or not.|`|AA11138696	Don't Do It.  Do Not Marry At 18  You Will Be Sorry.  Wait|`|79ab2ac723d6fa6d643348f5a67b7e74aa	In this case, you should wait.  You need to be certain that he has changed.  You also need time to think and mature...both of you.  Also consider that he is in the military.  Do you want the increased risk of being a widow?  Losing a spouse is a whole other experience.  Losing a boyfriend or even a fiance is hard.  Losing a spouse really is another experience.    You probably won't have to wait long, but it won't hurt to wait either.    And tell your parents how you feel.  Do so respectfully.  Your parents should know that you are basing your decisions on mature thoughts and genuine feelings.  It is possible that they are wondering just what you are thinking.  They might think this is crazy.    Whatever you do, act in love and respect.  You don't have to agree with your parents, and acting in love and respect will demonstrate maturity and thought.  Maybe that's what your boyfriend is doing.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Honestly, your age doesn't sound like the problem it's your relationship which would worry me.      Wait before you get married.  It sounds like you think marriage is going to change things.      1)  He's still in the army...how long of his contract is left? Does he like it?  Does he want to contnue with it?  Have you talked to him about it and if he wants to continue?    2) Just because you get married doesn't mean you get to spend more time together.  It is nice going to bed together and waking up together...but, marriage doesn't mean more time together ALL the time.  You have work, school, friends, family, other activites, ah...work.  You get responsiblites and by having more responsiblity that's less time to spend doing what you want...and with each other.  Don't get married because you want to spend more time together.  Learn to make time for each other now and then go from there.      3)  With the military they spend a lot of time away from their families.  Are you ready to deal with that?  What if he was deployed?    4) Parents have a way of sencing bad things in people.  Now, I'm not saying they know or appricate how your boyfriend has changed...but, even you admit he was manipulating you and controlling you and was treating you like crap.  Have you talked about that and how it made you feel?  Also, how long has he been good to you?  I would just encourgae you to wait longer for the fact he has a history which should send a reg flag....and make him want to wait for you a little longer to prove himself.     So...just wait a little..give him more time to prove himself to you.  Know that just because you're married doesn't mean more time.  You'll  both need to work to keep up finances and you will have financial burdens and all the "extra" time you have now will be spent working and keeping up a household.  Just something for you to think about.    Good luck!|`|mBczFuLmaa	WAIT!  What ever you do just wait....if you two are meant to be together it will happen...you are so young...I know 18 is an "adult" but you've got a lot of living to do over the next few years trust me...I'm 31...I waited till I was 27 before I married....looking back now there was so much happening in life between 18-25.....just enjoy your life, don't rush into anything...marriage is a serious thing that too many people take too lightly these days!|`|eBOxRUl7aa	ummm well if you are asking the general population this question I would say NO! cause you dont seem to sure of yourself. try to hold out a coule years because you are only 18 and probably just out of high school/ you have so much goin on right now just take it slow and see where life takes you.|`|EqJ2adW9aa	ok i suggest you wait. im saying this because im in the military, and you wont believe how many want to get married to get a house and a little extra money. trust me A LOT of them will do it. i say just wait. go to school, try get a career of your own going. if he loves you he'll support you.  marriage can wait|`|CYjrHrmAaa	Please wait. You dont sound mature enough to be getting married (its not even an age thing). Two years of being together might seem like a long time to you, but its really not. You both are still developing personality wise and emotionally. Don't rush into things. If you two are meant to be together, waiting to make a big move like getting married,  wont change it....you dont want to regret it later on in your life.|`|PH1eFiqwaa	Well from an older and wiser point of view.   I married at 18, we eloped as my parents thought he was not good enough.  We have been married for 45 years now and I do not regret any of it.  There have been moments, but everyone has those. Do what you feel is right.  I did and I have never looked back.   At 18 you can do just about anything you want to do, except drink.  But if you still live with your parents, then it is their house, their rules on most stuff.   Just follow your heart.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Well, I was going to tell you it didn't matter how old you were and to do it until I got as far as the treating you like crap thing. If he was like that before but not now give him time. I would definitely wait it out and see if he really has changed. Don't jump the gun and get married right after he has changed. Chances are he'll fall right back into the way he was. I could be wrong though but is it really something worth risking? NO! Wait. I'm not saying leave him but I'm just suggesting giving it a year and see how things are working. Good luck honey!|`|so95ktlIaa	At the age of 18 you dont know anything. Marriage is something you have to work hard at and I am sorry at the age of 18 you are just too young. Besides, didint you say he maniplutaed you? What's to say he isnt doing it again? Besides you need to get your life in order.....you need to go to college because the life of an Army spouse at times is lonely.     furthermore, you will not be able to live with him until he is done with training. And then what are you going to do if he gets sent to Korea or deployed for a year or more???    If you guys are really meant to be.....and he has changed so much then you should wait until atleast you are at least done with school.     I am sorry but I feel like you are making a huge mistake and I hope you dont get married.|`|eCfJCP6vaa	Even though you are 18 years old, you are still young and haven't even begun to live your life yet. Marriage is a huge step in life. You haven't even felt the responsibilities of taking care of yourself. Do you think you guys are ready for that type of commitment to one another? You really don't know a person until you have lived with them. Take your time, you guys just got back together, feel each other out First. You still have some old wounds that need to be attended to before you jump the gun. I'm sure the bond you have with your family will remain strong if you keep the lines of communication open. I think not only should you talk this over with your parents, I also think you should at least wait until you have experienced your life independently.|`|nFAkp9f4aa	your 18 do what you want. your family isnt marrying him YOU ARE.|`|sxegmou2aa	I believe you should wait a little bit longer just to see if the 'good behavior' doesnt change but eventually, if thats what you really want, you are going to get married no matter what anybody else wants. Besides they should let you make your own mistakes. If this guy isnt for you then YOU be the judge of that, not them.|`|anAp2Cu9aa	I would wait. Your 18 but 18 is still young. I got married at 19 and it is not what it is cracked up to be! My husband got a domestic violence for hurting me while I was pg. he has changed in some ways but he is selfish and cruel.We are in process of divorce. You are still young and if he treated you like crap before dont let the past repeat itself!!|`|tKxko51laa	well r u being presured into this.....im 13     and im not gettitng married until im in my 30's     becouse my parents got devorced and i want 2 make shure the man i marrie is the right 1    and RESPECTS ME FOR ME.....i wouldnt marrie him. becouse i could about garentie u something would happen     please.... u will thank me l8r  be rashinal (create adn out let get a job go to colage)    wait at least 2 years...!!! ok if everything goes well then marrie him. but things change and people change|`|l43NSgHyaa	I'm going to say wait, because of your prior dating history.  At one point in time, he treated you badly and was controlling.  The people around you, like your parents and family, are concerned that this might happen again.  You have forgiven and forgotten quickly, maybe a little too quickly.    I would say wait, just to see how the relationship progresses.  Many men will change for a short period of time, only to fall right back off the wagon and back to their old ways.  I'm not sure how long he's been home, but that's a huge factor.    Honestly, I don't think your parents are trying to do this to be mean or hurtful.  Based on what you've said, I think they are concerned for your safety and well-being.  I think, you should take their advice and wait it out.    You are still young and no need to rush into this.  You should wait it out and make him prove that he will not resort to his old ways.  After all, how do you know that his new charming behavior isn't a way of mainpulating you.    Trust me, I've seen that happen.  My cousin was in an abusive relationship and the guy tried to coax her into staying around and getting married.  He was super nice to her, right after a very explosive episode and acted as though he had changed.  But, in reality, he was just trying to con her back into the relationship. so he could marry her and then trap her into being his wife and he being the controlling husband.    So, please, wait it out.
GpbwKmViaa	What you should do is ask him if he still likes you. The truth is, guys hate it when girls try to make them feel jealous. They'll automatically assume you like that other person. If you still like him, tell him you like him, and that you hope he still likes you. If you want to go out with him, tell him that too. Not all guys get the choice to say yes or no. If he's liked you before, he probably still has feelings for you in his heart, no matter how deep.|`|Nrk9fT8waa	Curiousity kills. You won't know unless you ask him, then you will get your answer. If he gets the wrong idea, especially if you're talking to his friends, he may just lose interest because he's going to think you don't like him at all. Is that your intention? Ask yourself!|`|SXd74AHqaa	hi first off if he did like you and you were trying to make him jealous that just causes problems either you liked him are you didn't and to be do it with his friends don't show you very grown up because you would do nothing but cause them not to be friends and some guys don't care for a drama queen so you either like him are you don't.you wouldn't like it if he was messing with your friend to make you jealous would you? good luck with your man|`|wfiVjllPaa	go for it. rejection wont hurt, as long as you try you wont feel guilty for not asking|`|hiiQtIPxaa	ummm.. i'd probably just ask him if he wants to hang out with you on a weekend or somethin (see a movie maybe) and just explain the whole thing. If he still likes you, he'll understand haha. good luck!    :D|`|YS2I9y2haa	He's confused and doesn't know what to do.  He's waiting for you to ask him out, or just say- what the heck are you doing?    Just do it.|`|JGofbXZCaa	I think the best thing to do is to just talk to him if you like him and he likes you this should not even be a problem.|`|LN16RPuPaa	being your talking to his friends in front of him he may just think you never liked him you were just saying that and now your after one of his friends and you were just playing him. even if you do try talking to him again i doubt he will talk to you because your flirting with his friends and coming off as a player. so i think you might have blew your chance or simply he likes someone else either way your not helping by being a flirt.|`|dPULl5hjaa	flat out............just text and ask him.|`|1hciyvKdaa	If he was interested in you, then things would not of stopped, they would of progressed..........right? He not really interested, he just when confronted by you about if he liked you or you told him you liked him, made him make a decision and its not in your favor.|`|d9yyKVThaa	Take a chance.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	I don't think he liked you from the beginning, since he didn't DO ANYTHING like ask you out.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	maybe hard to tell|`|xfj1B7YSaa	just tell him!! and dont..DONT..do that jeaous strategy. maybe ask one if his frnds. since ur frnds with them too. good luck girl!|`|vhv4GBTVaa	don't try and do the sly jealousy thing, just confront him|`|MqzNE19Caa	he might still like youu he might just playing hard to get!|`|dqHt0moZaa	just ask him if he still feels the same way and try and talk to him more not his friend.|`|AuWPMH44aa	start sending him flirty texts again and if he does back then he does. and stop trying to get him jealous. thats just going to make him now like you|`|6c8p2xA3aa	well, i kinda have gone throught the same situation, but we still kinda talk. but he likes my best friend more. anyway, maybe he does like you still, but since he told you the truth, he must have gone over his league. being way too over confident might have made the guy a little strange  knowing that it went from flirting around to seriousness. just give him a little space so he can think things through .
TYwyRt9taa	well you could start off by mentioning the prom..being like "so are you excited for the prom?" do you have a date yet?" just something casual to see if she will give you any hints whether or not she wants to go with you and take it from there.|`|bYU77eteaa	"hey...you got a date to prom yet?"  ..."nooo" (in high pitch female voice)  "well, baby, today is your lucky day..."|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just ask if she has anyone to go with yet. you guys are already friends so it's just something to bring up|`|5ab1c8455ab9dfe1e501651c1af17f1aaa	Check if she's got a date. Then bake a cake and write "Will you go to the Prom with me?"    Make sure she knows who is asking|`|O1WxKk7uaa	if you have a class with here make a banner big enough for it to fit in class then hang the banner in your class.. put on the banner something like would you go to prom with me so and so sumn like that.. so when she walks into class shell read it.. just make sure its cool with your teacher and make sure shes ther on that day|`|ZvWyK94xaa	go to walmart and buy some poster board  find someone with nice writing and have them write  "*her name*, will you go to prom with me?"    when she gets to school in the morning be standing there all cute looking and hold it up for her and all her friends to see :]      or do this...  http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseac...|`|CXjuuUViaa	http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/datin...    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    http://www.helium.com/knowledge/163625-c...    One time, I asked my friend to prom with a puzzle. I bought a cheap 50 piece puzzle and put it together. I then flipped it over and wrote "Brian, will you go to prom with me?" on the back of it. I tied a bunch of baloons and streamers to his car while he was at work and put the puzzle in his drivers seat.   Also, one time before I left for BCT, I put "I love you" in glow in the dark stars in my BF's closet behind his clothes. Then I put a trail starting from there to right above his bed so that he would only notice it if he looked up at his ceiling at night. Obviously you could ask to prom in the same way if you had access to her room...  anywho.. good luck!|`|LsAjSUv8aa	Just ask her before someone else does.|`|bWMBuNiMaa	omg!  u just ask her out if u get rejected then move on to sumone else|`|tKxko51laa	COARGE nothing is more sexy then a man wiht coarge     it sounds stupid !! but it works just ask her !!!!    and dont act nervious !!!!    GOOD LK !!! AND HAVE GREAT PROM|`|AA12345296	you-"do you want to go to prom?"  her - "no."|`|76Fc356kaa	Very simple, do not make it difficult. Just tell her that you are thinking about going to the Prom and you would love if she wants to go with you. If she says yes, great, make plans to pick her up and do not forget to buy her the flower for her wrist......try to have fun and be a gentleman with her parents and her.  If she says no, then plan to go with other friends in group and still have fun, or invite another girl. Act like nothing after, no hard feelings and be nice.|`|qVt6wJqMaa	Go up to her and ask before someone else does!    Talk to her like you normally would, bring prom into the situation and casually, "Would you like to go to prom with me?"    You two can work out the friends/more than friends thing later, but make sure you do it soon-and good luck! |`|AA10456687	Just ask her dude. If she says no, move on and ask another girl.|`|8k6Q7bgDaa	Grow some balls.|`|QruXkDncaa	walk up to her.  push her into a locker.  and she'll just immediately know that you want her sexy body.|`|mYA7rbIwaa	you should just be like "yo can i sing you a song?" and she'll be like "why?" "BECAUSE I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME TO PROM WITH ME??!!!"  i think her heart might just melt  and don't forget to give her a kiss...not a real one just a chocolate.|`|pNJbydlNaa	text her or get a friend to go ask her for you (:  always works when guys ask me.|`|NcKnqPtMaa	buy a cheap box of fortune cookies from the store  type the question out on little rectangular piece of paper (type, print, cut)  then stick the little piece of paper in the fortune cookie  make dinner for her
mYAbq6fnaa	he sounds kind of like a jerk and annoying. when somebody asks someone to stop doing something that bothers them, and if the person wants to make the friendship work, they'll stop. its not that big a deal, so i probably wouldnt stop being friends with him over this, but if he continues to ignore your requests for him to stop doing unnecessary things, you may want to consider whether hes a friend worth keeping.|`|Au7GEfQiaa	He sounds very annoying. Hes probably your friend but your friends a jerk. And do you really want a friend thats a jerk?|`|n4QSgd7caa	ummm...all im gonna say is probably try to shorten your conversations or tell him if he does that your not his friend anymore|`|0QFKm3WLaa	You need to talk to this friend and find out. Don't worry so much - everything will become clear.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Can you give some examples when he hung up?      I hang up on my friends all the time.  I refuse to wait on hold when they have call waiting.  I understand if you take the call, but make up your mind who you are talking to.  If you want to take the 2nd call, fine.  Tell me you'll call me back.  If the 2nd call is not important, tell them you'll call them back and continue your conversation with me.    Sometimes there is a bad connection.  If someone is travelling thru a "dead" area, I can't hear what you are saying and I hang up.  Call me when you got a good signal.    If you call me from a loud bar and have to scream to talk or you can't hear me, I will hang up.  If you need to talk to me, walk outside where you can have a decent conversation.|`|u9UXdCbjaa	He is a jerk! Why and the world do you still talk to him? He does not respect for you.|`|lq1iFvNIaa	it sounds like he likes to make you mad. No that's not a friend.You don't need a "friend" like that.|`|E3COwkqBaa	he does not sound like he is even interested in you, instead of spending time on someone who sounds like they dont even appreciate you, find someone who will. there is no point in trying to make friends with someone who just doesnt want to do anything with you.|`|P96KyO77aa	Sounds like he use to be a friend and now....  now it sounds like he doesn't want to be bothered with any one else's issues with life. so if you don't want to deal with some one who obviously doesn't care about you kick him to the curb and delete his  . This type of friendship is a waist of time. find someone that is interested in what you have to say and cares about your feelings.       He is not worthy of your Friendship
aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Yes - you should go!  But go with a group of friends (not just a date).  Get dressed up, go out to dinner (someplace fun), and then dance, dance, dance!!!|`|5Nxb8aqRaa	sh*t, go there so much fun yeah but make sure you dont go alone, not just with you date go with other friends and after the dance go party its super fun
domEftoIaa	that song is sooooo perfect. ive never heard that before it makes you wanna cry.|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	it's a cute song but it seems like more of a love song than best friends.  try these (some of me and my best friend's songs lol:))    we all roll along by the maine:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJsbnNjnE...    white houses by vanessa carlton:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSBqmu4B8...    vegas by all time low  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U91bT3WDz...    :) hope this helps!|`|oUBUWfS6aa	It's good :]    Here's another video that I adore, its "friends forever" by Vitamin C  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWitXo2sg...    Here's the same song but with LYRICS:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMPRh_ly6...|`|fY9nkXZUaa	Yes it is a good song it made me cry!!|`|7UTupepFaa	I like it. It is good for that kind of thing.  I also really like the song "Until the Day I Die" by Story of the Year. That song is a really great song about friendship, most people think it is a song they are singing about a girl, but it's really about the guy in the band and their awesome friendship and how they will always be there for each other. I really think it is a good way of expressing you feelings for your friends,your video, I mean.    Song links-http://www.playlist.com/searchbeta/track... (Until the day I die)
gGNKMqUNaa	hi sweety donot be so angry  just maintain a good relationship with some one other whom you like  then let your exboyfriend reliaze  that you are happy with your new boyfriend  hug your new boyfriend and kiss him in front of your ex boyfriend  and believe me it will be the real kick in butt for your ex   boyfriend    please answer my question by clicking on my profile then on my questions..........plsssssssssssssssssss|`|B7fQ6dUtaa	Catch him while he is bending over, swing ur boot backwards, then in a fast motion, throw ur boot forward at his BUTT..!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	honey you do not need his worthless a$* for anything. sounds like you already got everything going for you. once you finish school and think that you are ready to be in a relationship, where you will make time to spend with that person then you should call this jerk back if you still want him but in the mean time you do not need to give up anything for him. if he is spreading those kind of rumors people will know that they are not true, he is just angry because you left him. really let him go you deserve better ....good luck|`|4EWCegiRaa	You're driven and most people can't handle that.  They think you're being self-centered because they're lazy and don't understand.    He's not the one for you, don't waste your time thinking about this guy anymore.|`|tJel8yiFaa	Best way to get back at him .... Live a long, healthy, happy life, and never look back.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	you warned him about your hectic lifestyle,he tried but failed to deal with it   you sound like your heads on straight,his loss
qVt6wJqMaa	You did the right thing-you told him how you felt!  The ball is in his court, and if he asks this Andrea girl out, then you have a decision to make.    1.  You can stop being his friend, mourn a little, and eventually move on.    2. You can continue to be his friend, silently obsess over him, and make yourself miserable.    3. You can continue to be his friend, be a little awkward at first, but eventually start looking outside of his radar for a new guy, which will eventually result in your making yourself happy, but will take longer...    Of course the most mature choice is the third, but it's pretty tough to handle.  I know from personal experience that the second choice doesn't work-so don't do that to yourself!  And of course the first is probably the most reasonable and easiest to take.    Either way, do this with finesse.  Prepare yourself as if he did ask Andrea out.  Treat him no differently and eventually ask, if he doesn't tell you, how it went with Andrea.  If he tells you that he did ask her out, tell him that you're disappointed, but happy for him, and then move on with your life.  Don't be a number 2.  You're way to good for a number 2.    I wish I knew how this turned out...good luck, sweetie!|`|KZyV6Fmtaa	okay the couple girls that answered first are dumb.  he might be scared to ruin your friendship if you're so close.  or... he might just be a normal guy.   either way, if you don't want to lose him as a friend, getting past your feelings would be the best idea.   yeah those feelings will probably always be there, but you dont want to kick him out of your life completely just because he likes another girl.   whats meant to be will work out. it takes time.|`|dPULl5hjaa	too much drama - i quit reading|`|uQXPDfGUaa	what?|`|6c8p2xA3aa	well you really cant force him to liike you back . and since he has known you, you have no more time to change yourself into being like Andrea . Best if you find another guy . maybe one even hotter ?|`|TdSaXkFSaa	If you keep waiting around for him to ask you out it may not happen. Guys always think that they're stuck in some sort of friend zone after a certain point and then don't ask because they don't want to be rejected. Same thing happened to me. But another reason why he isn't asking you out, is because you told him it was okay to ask another girl out. If you didn't mean it you shouldn't have said it!!!!! Now he thinks that you don't like him enough to fight for him. If I were you, I would just ask him out. If he says no, you can try again later. Or move on. Either way you win eventually.|`|gHDj6B7xaa	ok im gonna try my best to acctually help you out...mabey u shud confront rick and ask him if there ever could be you two together. if he says mabey or yes ask him why he wont just ask you out and you two can test it out. if he says no then this way you can clear the air and know wat you need to know and get over him..i really hope i helped :)|`|ZvU093GPaa	I do not think there is anything wrong with you more like there is something wrong with him . If he dose not know a pretty girl already likes him for him than he is the one with the problem not you. my advice cut the sucker loose and find a guy that will appreciate you .|`|QgGGa5yraa	tell him how you feel, you have nothing to lose, everything to gain.|`|TGjM9F9Waa	You sound very emotional about this. i'd say just move on. NEXT
AA12004880	If he doesn't want to be with you, he just doesn't.    No amount of whining and begging is going to bring him back. It's only going to annoy him and convince him of WHY he doesn't want to be with you even more.    Get a life.|`|kzbEWqgLaa	well just make him jealous... Flirt around with other guys and see if he'll like it....|`|GpbwKmViaa	It won't work. You'll just grow old of each other eventually, unless the rare possibility occurs where the need for each other increases instead of diluting. If you like him, pursue him a bit longer. If he still holds his ground, then leave him. He's probably using that as an excuse to get rid of you. If that happens, you've already tried your hardest so it's time to give up. You probably deserve better!|`|I4I16khvaa	Guys want what they can't have, maybe he'll realize he misses you.  Don't think about it, though.  You're an amazing girl, if he doesn't want you, someone else will.  Try to feel empowered, convince yourself you don't need him.|`|6c8p2xA3aa	if you ignore him even more, then he might think you dont want him back . give him some space . maybe things havnt worked out . try to think about what happened wrong and try to fix them . maybe let him have his space, but dont let go COMPLETELY !
bVQJAS22aa	Well take it slow. Be really sweet to her too! Girls love that. Relax. Clear your mind before you do it too. Say I know this might be weird but I like you. Then just let her think. Try to do this in private. The complement her. Hopfully everything works out as planed. I hope I. Oils help!|`|yzEC5O6gaa	u can give her a note or txt her or call her|`|T1z1SGe3aa	lol kid|`|3AAtPzSaaa	wear a nappy|`|bM4zYt44aa	If you're that nervous about it then you're probably too young.  Ever since my balls dropped and I became an adult I realized that it's not that big of a deal.  But I do remember when I was young and hardly knew what certain parts of my body were for I had the same problem as you.  Leave it alone until you grow up.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	put a chip clip on your ding dong|`|vwoqIUR6aa	send her a card or a note that says you like her. we need a better idea of what the situation is?? do you know her in any way, a class with her??|`|qdep99QWaa	be brave|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	just tell her! don't make a big deal out of it.|`|nWoESULQaa	pee before asking her out...lol jk   You can tell a girl by liking her if your in school (which im assuming you are) You can pass a note that says i like you. You can Tell her. You can hint it like saying shes pretty. You can even text her or call her....(number from student directory....thingy) Good luck. dont pee in your pants though she probably wont like you! lol :D|`|g4nlUfmeaa	You don't have to tell her you like her.  Show her you like her with appropriate compliments, light teasing and flirting, etc.  Volunteer to do stuff with her when you get the opportunity, ask her to do things with you (invite others along if you're shy about asking her out on a date now, etc.)    Or you could just tell her, but really that's going to be a little awkward if she doesn't feel the same way.  Instead I think it's better to try laying on a little charm and feeling her out to get a sense if she might feel the same way.|`|0OFDLHJaaa	dont tell her. all ya got 2 do is this... 1. be nice to her be friendly but not to friendly. 2. show her u care for her and laugh at her jokes and listen to wat she has to say. 3. when u have an ok bond ask her to hang with u. 4. show her your a gentlemen and not a slob. 5. after the end of the day ask her to hang out with u more often, if she says no she doesnt like u that much, if she says yes u win:)|`|7idLr1Rxaa	you could do it electronically (text, email, myspace) I don't know how old you are so it's kinda difficult to suggest things. If you are in high school you could use all your friends to your advantage and have your friend as her friend if she likes you. Bring her a small gift like Starbucks, little debbie snack cake and be like "I have an extra if you want it". Also if you are on a sports team or in band or something you could invite her to a game.|`|igLsH24Qaa	Don't do it! Telling a girl you like her is a great way to drive her away. I know that is counter intuitive but it is the way it works. Also, telling a woman that you think she is pretty will get you shut down faster than lightning. Take a look at www.doubleyourdating.com it might help. it really helped me.|`|nyeUUojFaa	there are products for this, u just have to pick the right one.|`|OEZ57OUZaa	Grow some balls.|`|apR0kehBaa	You have friend go up with you and you tell her that you are nervous about telling her. then tell her|`|rHHI4FNDaa	make sure you take a  1 before and maybe even pray a little.     sorry i cant help u|`|VQFkjf4xaa	just ask her u dummy. its not that hard|`|4TqadRJYaa	Practice on a fat girl, tell her while you are standing in front of a urinal, or go pee immediately before the deed.|`|qxs0VPXmaa	what happened to me was the kid always offered me his seat, to share a seat with him, then he asked me if i like him... it was awkward, and i didnt like him which made it worse, so i wouldn't do that... lol. xD well i would just give her a necklace and tell her you like her, it could be a note or anything. or just straight up say it.|`|abeHfpdZaa	just try and make it casual ask her on a date if you haven't done so already... if it's casual then it won't be so intense and akwad if you get rejected. sorry but you gotta be ready fro that lol.|`|7UTupepFaa	BAHAH.     You're silly.    Well.... my boyfriend is a musician and so, he wrote me a song and he sang it to me. I thought it was the most amazing thing ever. Sooo.. basically use whatever talents you have and come up with a cool way of doing it, that won't give you "stage fright". i.e. If you can draw, make her a picture, if you can sing, sing her a song, if you can write, write her a poem. Speaking honestly, us girls LOVE it when guys are creative about that stuff.|`|EiQb9rXAaa	HOnestly, i think that being honest is the best thing you can do. Mabey while your out with her tell her something like "you know i am attracted to you" and see what she says. But don't stress her; continue to be the same friend you are to her just to see her vibe. She will probably expect to feel wierd(mabey) but the fact that you are acting normal is going to make her wonder???? therefore; she will want you.|`|GmoFQ41Paa	Look at her eyes and tell her. She will accept it as a compliment. But you have to sound realistic for her to accept it!|`|t7K7ETfgaa	it's really not hard.  don't just approach her and tell her, that's a little too forward and could be shocking.  hang out and talk with her as much as you can.  when you've had what feels like a good conversation and you can tell she's having a nice time talking to you, then tell her "look, I just want to let you know, I really like you."  If you want to ask her out, then add to that "Would you like to go out sometime?" or if you like her but just want to be friends, then add to the first bit "Yeah, I really like you, and I just really wanted to get it off my chest and let you know, but I really cherish our friendship and I don't want to ruin it, I'd like to just be friends with you.  I just wanted to tell you how I feel."  Something like that, but make it your own. How old are you anyway?|`|y5bvP25caa	why do you think you are gonna piss your pants?!!!when you love somebody,just tell her.if you think you are not stable enough to say you love her or you are scared,say it to your best friend,maybe that person can tell her.you can yourself better.BE STRONG.    peace.|`|0MV2ptAzaa	well the first couple of answers are pretty "Dicky". so let me give you some real advise, if you have history with her.....like you have actually talked to her before then it will be a lot easier to talk if not first try to find common ground...u liking guns and her ponies u probably would get together anyway, right? after that (when ur friends) ask her to join you to the movies **with friends** so it doesn't seem awkward after talking with her for bout a week should b OK to ask her out then (because by then u actually feel comfortable around her)
pSy88C9paa	You need to do what is best for you and your girlfriend.  There is no reason to tollerate @**hole for the sake of popularity.  Plus, your parents are adults, they can handle their friendships themselves.  Put this guy in his place.
AA11123333	Sounds like you two have your problems, but it's been pretty good so far.  I would try talking to someone close to her (a sibling, best friend, parents, etc) and seeing if they're noticing changes in her too.  Maybe she DID run out of meds or something.  Try to figure out what's going on, but be careful.  You dont want her to accuse you of spying or conspiring against her, crazy at it sounds.  All in all, just be there for her.  She might need you.      P.S.  The whole haricut thing is about her being unhappy with herself/her life at this point.  She thinks if she can get some dramatic haircut, her life will change as well.  It's not so.  She's just acting out because she's having some sort of crisis.    Good luck.|`|th4eHIrTaa	Hmm. It could be that she isn't getting enough love and attention that she wants, .. If she really thinks that she is that bipolar that she can't control herself without her meds, then that is a problem... With or without the meds, she shouldn't be acting this way. She might have gotten into a thinking mode about all the past problems and decided to be a ***** to you. It happens. But overall, be truthful and sweet to her..   She is saying all that stuff about her hair and stuff to get your attention. And looks like she did just that.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Probably right she must off her pills.|`|Li0q9NKCaa	give her her space. that's all you can do. if she needs you she'll call. until then just step back and reassess the relationship. do you really want to be with a crazy person?|`|7EgQmKTlaa	OK...Happiness is a Inside job..You can't make her happy. There is a great possibility that she will be the way she is now for the rest of her life. You have to ask yourself "Is this how I want to spend the rest of my life?"    BiPolar individuals struggle with relationships, you need to prepare yourself for a Emotional Roller Coaster Ride with the Joker controlling the switches...Good luck..I've been ther myself and I should have walked sooner than I did..
hL10aahTaa	1. my bf and me played with each other (a jacket on top of both of us) during  a road trip in the back of an SUV with his sister sitting right next to him! She even looked at me and asked "are you ok?" i guess i was making faces or panting? *blush*. My bf had to say "oh she's just sleepy" LOL    2. did the same thing (pillows over us btw.) but sitting on the couch with his sister sitting across from us TALKING to me. I even asked my bf a question about what we were conversing and he had a pretty hard time trying to answer...    3. at a park in the men's restroom...when we got out...his sister had walked right out of the women's restroom (which was on the side). My bf covered for me saying..."she had to use this restroom since the women's one was really dirty! and i kept watch so that no guy would enter" She was like "i KNOW! they were dirty!" i was sooo nervous...lol    THE END ^^|`|L38M9lrLaa	in the bathroom at my old work|`|YzCTq13caa	Your bed|`|QcG71AOmaa	under the covers in my sisters bed an then at my friends house once :P haha.|`|OfYRmdQOaa	too personal but i could only tell you at the bathroom|`|lvelp0CGaa	Hahahahahahaha wow you extrovert you .

AA11749273	You have to go up to him. Just say "sorry but im in a committed relationship, I really like you as a friend and find you very interesting and hope we can do stuff together.    Girls sometimes don't know how hard it is for us to ask a girl, and a lot of times if we get rejected we think its a blight on our personality.     Hope this helps.
6sAPIvvjaa	Well, I'm also a guy so my answer is no, but...    Girls like a guy with confidence, this can be one of the hardest things that guys have to come up with. If you are shy and don't have a lot of confidence you can still get a girlfriend, but you will have to work at it a bit more than the average Joe. Firstly, always be nice, be willing to listen and remember that girls don't bite, they actually want someone to talk to them since it always feels nice to know that someone is interested in talking to you. This is true if you are a guy or a girl. People always say "just be yourself", and this is true but the way you interact with your guy friends is going to be a bit different from the way you interact with your girlfriends. The sarcasm that guys love and find hilarious does not always go over so well with the ladies. Try to be sensitive enough to know when you are being rude or talking about something that may make them feel uncomfortable or embarrassed.     When you are talking to a girl try not to spend too much time just talking about yourself. It's important to try and find out their interests and ask them questions about the things they like or what they are into. You will find that if a girl is interested in you she will want to know about the things you like, for example, playing your guitar and rocking out with your band. This doesn't mean that this is all she wants to talk about, she is hoping you will show a mutual interest in her and her own interests. This will help keep the conversation going especially if you are usually quiet or you get stressed out trying to think of something to talk about.     It's also cool to be intelligent but don't try too hard to impress anyone with your massive knowledge. If you are smart she will know, you don't have to try and prove it to her. (Especially don't try reciting any Monty Python film scripts you have memorized and find endlessly entertaining, chances are, she won't). The last bit is to be honest, don't exaggerate or make false claims about yourself, on the other hand, too much false modesty can be just as unattractive as bragging yourself up. Strive to keep these things in perspective and balanced.    As you can see from some of the responses to your question, there are a lot of girls your age that would like to get to know you and would certainly give you a shot at a date. Don't let the fear of rejection stop you from trying and then trying again. Good luck.|`|Yzyo1QcGaa	hell ya you sound like u have a GREAT personality and SUPER cute im suprised you don't have girlfriend|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Um. I'm a straight guy.

If all that stuff is true, and we had stuff to talk about then i'd definetly date you ;)|`|5V1J2fv0aa	depends what you look like :D and how  u talk etc... and how u treat girls...  many things u didnt mention..   So a No for now :)|`|VfBVyNz9aa	You sound pretty great. :) Actually, pretty perfect in my opinion. XD Is that seriously you though? :) Sounds to good to be true... XD|`|xnV20aqbaa	You killed it when i found out your in 10th grade and 15yrs old =[[    I LOVE CANADIAN's well Seth Rogan =]]    And brown hair hazel eyes....you got it going for you.|`|dvUx5G2Raa	You seem like a nice guy. I'm in 10th grade too but, I prefer guys 5'9" (like it matterz lol) and i prefer guys with longer hair and is a lil skater. And I like guyz that wear certain brands...xDD like volcom, element, & quicksilver....thatz just my point of view     GL! Hope This Helped xDD|`|r8ST3cFIaa	Yeah you sound really sweet. I love shy guys because they are mysterious lol. I also love the sarcasticness haha. Plus, every girl like a guy who can play guitar. You sound like a great guy, I would go out with you, if I knew you. Well, good luck finding a girl. =)|`|a0cDZiFvaa	YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH|`|AA10975334	. From reading profile, you sound like a wonderful person. Being that you are only 15, I don't think too many people would expect you to have a job. Yeah, the economy is bad everywhere.     If I was 15, I would probably date you, but I am old enough to be your mother. :0D     Oh yes, it sounds like your parents brought you up right and I hope that you don't lose those qualities you have. Just keep making them better. !|`|AMqr9Xceaa	Hells yes! :D:D|`|qMBf2vgiaa	4 yrs older then me so no and i got a bf|`|WlnnsGM5aa	You sound like you have a good personality, and if I was a girl your age I would probably date you,|`|SctDZPKraa	Yeah! because you play electric guitar, so do I!|`|LQmaAffPaa	deffentley.  ha ha.|`|IeU2tdi4aa	OH YEAH! YOU HAVE HAZEL EYES TOO!  MINE ARE HAZEL BUT THEY ARE SLOWLY TURNING GREEN WHICH MAKES ME MAD!    I know I'm not answering your question but you just recieved 5 additional noob points for asking this question on Yahoo answers    (remember, CAPS LOCK is cruise control for cool)|`|76Fc356kaa	Well, I believe I would, but my only concern would be your sarcastic sense of humor. Not all of us go for that because you will sound mean and arrogant, but you also mention you are easy going person, so , I would need to see your behavior in a group of friends...that will determine if you are a keeper or a creep.|`|OPgfyIABaa	You sound like a really nice guy and all, but the fact that you need to have to ask a question online, proves you have low self esteem. Be confident!    Love yourself before you can ever be loved (:|`|HkGSx0HIaa	umm no because this post shows the level of your maturity, which is immature. sorry.|`|MgrKkduxaa	lol i'm not a girl and am not gay but no b/c ur lacking something interesting about u.   electric guitar maybe but its hard to play off depending on what kind of music u play. Its all about conversation b/c girls really aren't interested in guitars o music after a while. (u think they would when the love a guy playing guitar)|`|zMVxipftaa	hell yea..u sound like a really nice, funny n cute guy....if u have AIM add me pinkelephants25 lmao...jk u don't really have 2 im jus bored 2 =D|`|AA12165129	all these people with the rude comments need to shut up.  they must be jealous haha  cause they can't play any kind of instrument,  i know i am.  and yes i would, you seem like a cool guy :)|`|YS2I9y2haa	Aww! You sound nice.   I have a really bad cold- and a strep throat too lol :)  I feel your pain.. feel better!    One question- what is your favorite song? That always tells me what kind of a person you are, trust me.|`|MekUlyGpaa	i am sure that there are girls that would like to go out with you   you have a lot of good qualities no i would not go out with you because that would be illegal and just not right but my guess is there is already some girls that are waiting on you to ask them out
TGjM9F9Waa	Just find yourself a nice catholic girl. they r all FREAKS if u catch my drift|`|0QqFd23Saa	she's emo.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	if she is emo I wouldn't bother, find a normal girl who is not in to fads|`|VYkKfCGZaa	Usually she's making a stupid desision by using her interest as an excuse for not being with you. You should tell her that even though she doesn't like you, she should go with you just as a try or at least as friends. She should also try to like you and if she can't go as friends.|`|1UZMBxpeaa	be dazzling, charming, witty. flirt with her, but then ignore her. girls like that like a chase.|`|AA10614910	why do you still want to??  Just leaver her alone!  Jeez she's told you outright and you are still trying to "hit on her". Men.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	In love and affairs of the heart do not list to anyone, not even her friend, u must deal directly with the girl.  Maybe the odds r against u, but still u must courageously make your move, that is called dashing. The girl will definitely fall for a dashing young man|`|vk6sczbLaa	You say, "Your friend seems pretty convinced that she knows your likes and dislikes, and what kind of person you're going for. I really wanted to ask you out because I think you're beautiful, but I thought I should let you know that your friend already turned me down for you. I sure hope you trust her to pick well for you."|`|xFq3b4FKaa	take a common friend along, let them talk... and then slowly hop in :)|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	move on.  especially if she's emo.  she'll only bring you down  *misery loves company*|`|76Fc356kaa	She does not like your looks, period. You wil need to change your whole YOU, to pull her attention...is she worth all that?  I believe you must be very young to still be worrying about these things. Enjoy and one day you will mature. Do not worry about it or her.  Don't sweat for small things, ny friend.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	well if she isnt intersted why try  you cant force someone to like or go out with you  then it wouldnt be true  dude, there are sooo many girls out there that are beautiful trust me|`|28YYgboCaa	Well, if she actually IS emo she'd LOVE the fact that you're trying to talk to her. If she isn't like that then she's just a poser, but that doesn't mean I won't help. Ignore the fact that her friend said that.  First, try to aproach her. Bring her something that she might like. Try making a poem, make sure it says something that let's her know there is hope. U don't HAVE to, but cuz ur a guy u probably already like dark colors.  Just try dressing a little more gothic or something. Try asking her out and she'll probably say yes, but if she says no, then just say ,"I understand" and she'll get the feeling of hope.    Hope this helps! I have faith that this'll work!!!|`|kmSMvPKtaa	ignore her...I'm still here...hahaha|`|iKwHJJi2aa	dont bother...|`|j5BF4Pnmaa	this may seem odd, but, you don't hit on her.  Do something that she wouldn't expect you to to get her to talk to you.  Then once she starts getting interested in you, at first act the way she did (don't overdo it)  Eventually you'll most likely hit it off|`|WlnnsGM5aa	If you know from the start that its not going to work, don't waste your time. Girls like that aren't worth it. Sorry.|`|YYoLvohEaa	Become friends with her instead. Don't make it too obvious that you like her and eventually want to go out with her. Then maybe after you get to know her better, ask her out since by then you have an idea of what she wants.|`|g0Jd46Xxaa	honestly, do not listen to her friends. the only way to find out if she likes you is to talk to her yourself. nobody is better than anyone else (everyone has insecurities/problems etc.)  have confidence, if she doesn't like you, thats just her opinion, not everyones.|`|r2TDODUCaa	dude, dont waste your time. i know how this is. she sounds like a total *****. i was in the same situation except the girl i liked was from india and thought i was wierd cause i have longish hair and stretched earlobes. she hung out with the people who i guess im not friends with but she was a total *****, and i know how it feels. just dont waste your time you probubly dont have that much in common  anyways :/|`|vx269WOWaa	no stuff her.  if shes "too cool" or whateva to be interested in u then leave her to sulk by herself.  shes emo. she'll probably attempt to slice her wrists or somethin cos her friends are doin it.  find someone who will be interested in you and like u for who u r.  u sound pretty nice and determined so im sure theres someone out there who'd b happy to have u.|`|AYkGxr0faa	don't let her be the one to shoot you down. i'm not sure how, it'll depend on what she's like, but you have to get her talking to you. once she does that, you have the power, even if its not about something important, shoot her down. i know girls like that, that is their biggest weakness.    but if i were you. i wouldnt go for her at all, she sounds like she is pretty wrapped up in herself and may never truly let someone in. you should try to find a decent and real girl.
AA10065812	Boy, are we a little heated up on a brand newly created profile.  And with a sentence that looks like it was constructed by an adult, but purposely with misspelled words.      Try a little harder next time.|`|07YBD5mJaa	hmm.  seems to me that you should probably be discussing this in an anger management or a Therapy session.  All families have their issue's, doesn't mean we all get on Yahoo and rant about it.  I am sorry to hear about your distress, but you should seek help from professionals, not a bunch of strangers from around the world.  best of luck to you.|`|eqWftUQeaa	WHAT???|`|NoT3WGaEaa	Wow and I thought I had family issues.|`|skslxcvPaa	did your mom had emotional issues in the past?|`|8yE2sYGeaa	So why hasn't dad pressed charges against her?|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Get Professional help.|`|AA11969451	I understand that you are upset. What is your question?|`|AA10356776	and the question is...?|`|64t8ynCyaa	Is this a question anyway if your family is like this they are really messed up if I could I would say f but this will be taken off although I think the moderators would agree with me on this one|`|kdTyaBmeaa	I don't know.   My love goes out to you.   Thinking about her is draining your blood. Try to think about her less. It must be hard.     Put your attention somewhere else....that is what i can advice.|`|LYQM0lKgaa	some people aren't that great. but we have to look passed them and go on with our lives.  your mom sounds like she has some mental issues that need dealing with.  but you would not be satisfied with yourself if you were to kill her. and she still is your mother.|`|OfYRmdQOaa	wow wow wow wow she sure sound like a Bith but don't do anything to her she's still your mom
3GG5Lx7zaa	she's being unfair. take a pair of shorts with you just in case.  when ya'll are out and she sees how hot it is, ask her if you can change in your shorts now and change to jeans when it gets cooler.|`|qVt6wJqMaa	She's looking out for you...overprotective, but she is just looking out for you.  Unfair is a pretty harsh way of putting it, but you have a right to be annoyed, too.  Just don't start something out of this, you'll feel better to just let it go...|`|UIA7aw0jaa	Yeah it might be annoying but that's a parent's job. She is just looking  out for you. It is so not even a big deal at all. Pick your battles.. no need to have a argument over a pair of shorts. :]|`|961PBKmAaa	How old are you, like 8?  There's no other way your mom could have that much control of what you wear.  Just put on a pair of shorts and tell your mom to shut up.|`|jd9GA3cUaa	diddo|`|NoT3WGaEaa	She's unfair. You are still living with her so tough.|`|up6xgVsAaa	Ur being stupid
l43NSgHyaa	I'm currently living at home also and I understand your pain.  I obey all my parents rules and I'm respectful, yet my mom invades what little personal space I have.  I once asked this question and people told me to move out, but I'm not going to tell you that.  I'm saving too and honestly, we are being really mature about that.   With the way the economy is, it's best to save what money you have, instead of paying a rich landlord and getting no benefits (money wise) from paying rent.     You just need to speak with you mom.  If that doesn't work, then consider keeping certain things away from her.  If I have something I absolutely do not want my mom seeing, I leave it in my car or store it at a friend's house.    Maybe, that will work for you.      Best of Luck.  Good Luck saving!|`|IDrA6gMxaa	You need to talk to her as you deserve some privacy. Remember however that you are staying at your mom's house so there will always be some "spying". Just talk to her to "reduce" it.|`|UIA7aw0jaa	I think she might be trying to get you to move out by annoying you. She could use the excuse, "its my house, you live under my rules" type thing. I think if you do not like it and it really bothers you then just save enough  to move out. Wish you  the best! :]|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You move out... this is not very subtle harassment. Hint, hint.  Find a small garage apartment or efficiency in your stomping grounds.  Have all your mail hitting a PO box.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	Deal with it.  Your living with mommy, so be a good little boy!|`|lCWIYPLtaa	just go|`|mLUELEkFaa	Move out  Or have a conversation about it with her. Maybe she doesnt think that it bothers you. But be open.|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	She's worried? Tell her to stop.
MS6iXXMYaa	Think only about the good things in your life. The move you think about bad things, the longer they will stick with you and the more you'll have.  Only think about the things you have already and set goals for what you "will", not "want to have", in the future and they will eventually come true.  Say to yourself and believe "I will have this by next month or next year", not "I wish I had this", or "I want to have this one day"|`|AA10291906	i am i dont know what to do with my life i have been living in the us since i was a litlle kid and now that i grew up i find out i have no rights because i am not a citizen in fact im not even supposed to be in america but where do i go if i have lived all my life in america.  i cant get a driver licence i cant get a job buy a house or even get a F*(&i%N credit card i dont know what to do but probably get the hell out of this stupid country i know how u feel this stupid goverment dont help SH9T When i graduated from highschool i wanted to go collage but guess what i cant freaking go to collage either they need prove from me to be a citizen i wanted to be a firefighter but all my dreams are dead i cant even finace for a car thats how bad it is i have to work in mcdonalds or washing dishes with a fake name isnt that nice???

utwCJWhQaa	Well try to look at places. Corpus Christi (My home town) is a relatively large coastal city with heat. Another place is the florida area, the maine area, and california.    Good luck with your new career.    http://www.fishermannow.com/    P.s Check out this site. It has tons of info on becoming a fisherman.|`|igLsH24Qaa	You need to live in a coastal area that has a fishing fleet. Look for fishing companies that have several boats. It is hard dangerous work. You can also work in the tourist trade on charter fishing boats. You need to go down to the docks and talk to the fishermen. If you don't want to be cold you need to stick to the south or the West Coast.
JlDcVTVsaa	tell your mother in law that you really cant stand the dog any more, and if her house is not ready she can put the dog in a pet hotel untill she is ready for it. (just say it in a polite way)|`|oKExTm8paa	Have you discussed this with your husband? What does he say?     The dog is a problem and that is probably why you got her for free. Call your M-I-L and tell her you are taking the dog back to the breeder.  Give her the exact date. Tell her she will have to make up her mind before that date whether or not she wants the dog. Then take the dog back and get on with your life.    You've waited long enough for an answer. Get rid of the dog. Just be sure to give MIL the date the dog will be gone.    (I think if she really wanted the dog, she would have it by now. She's probably sorry she offered to take the dog and doesn't want to hurt YOUR feelings. Smile.)
MX1shAbcaa	Tell her that she better have her stuff out on the 5th, remind her again but don't say it in a mean way.  If  the 5th comes around wait a bit if she isn't doing anything then yeah, throw it out  ~William
t1inn1nLaa	14 is too young for a bf. Are you kids insane? You wanna get her hurt worse than this, putting herself into something she's not prepared for?    Now to the asker,    There's nothing to worry about your chest at 14    You are wrong that being older means work till you hit your grave    Once you go to college, you will have the time of your life. Its really hard to explain, but once you are 23, as old as I am now, you are going to know what I know and more. You'll know that the best is still ahead of you|`|AA12204338	I can remember being 14 like yesterday.  It's such a hard time.  My parents not only wouldn't let me go out but I couldn't even spend the night with any of my friends.  I was 4'11" and 85lbs and I only started wearing a bra @ 13.  All of my friends seemed to stab me in the back.  It seems never ending.  Listen, I have 2 little girls and I understand why my mom wouldn't let me go out or stay over.  Be grateful your parents care enough to know where you are and they love you enough to worry.  (And, btw, I had no business @ 14 going out or staying over with some of those friends).  Also, 14 is just too young to be talking about having sex!  You prepared to face an STD @ 14 or pregnancy @ 14?  Let it go.  Hang in there.  Your mom was 14 once, don't be so quick to dismiss her.  Times really don't change that much.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	We get it, you're emo.|`|CK6RDZZ1aa	well that just stinks     poopy|`|r3WkhpBpaa	Hang in there. Have you thought about getting involved with a good church youth group? You know it is really hard to see right now, but your parents really do know best and one day you will thank them. You may not realize until you are married and have children what a blessing it was that your parents LOVE you enough to watch out for you. As to all the parties and the kids running around and sleeping together...it isn't as great as it looks. Kids at 14 really have no reason to be doing those things.|`|DTW0704Faa	I AM IN THE EXACT SAME POSITION AS YOU.  And it doesn't feel good.  I actually have no real friends( I have quite a few but, none of them are actually close)  I have no social life out of school, and my family alwayso ask why i never go out and enjoy myself, but i never give them the true answer  =(  I have a group of friends but it seems to me that thier not he right type, thier SO much diffrent to how i am, and i hate how they act sometimes.  Everyone has gone of in thier own groups now, so i'm finding it really hard to make new friends, to tell the truth i've actually kind of stopped trying now because i just think theres absolutely no point in it anymore. My sister is actually really lucky, she has everything, i actually really look up to her, her friends are such great people and they probably know me better than my actual friends do, she's also really smart, I really wish i was like her, I can't explain my true feelings to anyone at all, whenever i am enjoying myself with my family, i always remember and it brings me down, I don't think i've actually been happy with nothing to worry about AT ALL for about a year or two now..  But hey, I'm gonna add you now!  and if you need to chat, don't hesitate =)|`|op4gBJRJaa	Lets start at the basic's for the girls to make you look good.  1. Use make up in a good way to make you look pretty & older.  2. Also eat lots so your Boob's grow and you grow, but also exercise so you don't gain too much weight & also use push up bra's so your boobs look bigger while their growing.  3. Talk to guys, don't be afraid to ask them questions have little talks with them.  4. Find a talent your good at, or just simply join a school activity that suits a girl e.g. Netball don't take up football, rugby they don't really suit girls (Not being sexist) Guys find girls quite manly if they play men sports.  5. Dress like a girl, e.g. Skirts, tank tops, bikini's etc...    For the parents.  1. Consult them, talk to them how you are old enough to go out with you friends.  2. Make sure they know that you are feeling left out and loosing reputation amongst your friends because your parents are not letting you go out with them  3. Say you need them to trust you or your life is going to take the wrong path and end up bad.    Also other things you can do.  I know this may sound weird but...  1. Masturbate and watch porn, this will completely change your life, your body will develop to want this more so you will be more confident with guys.  2. Hooking up with guys, In other word's just meeting up with them just the two of you and go to a movie and just make out etc... this can raise your popularity a lot depending on the guy.  3. Let guys touch you if they want, letting a guy feel you up is what every guy wants a horny girl.  4. If you have a skirt at school, wear nice colorful knickers e.g. pink,yellow, light blue and then flash guys, like when your sitting down just put legs straight on the floor so guys can see right up it, this brings a lot of attention and they will try look everyday, then they tell all their friends to look and stuff.      After doing these guys may start to realize you and then theres your first boyfriend.|`|ahZMQ9rBaa	u shuld get a bf sweetheart|`|iG0nAZKGaa	I'd say find a hobby ,activity that you can sink yourself into n get your mind off of the worrying part.As for boys n your body that will all change in time.As for friends, be yourself the ones who like you for you are important ,the others don't concern your self with.One close friend is all you need.Parties n young sex,they are a disaster for trouble.You  are young n have a whole world of things to experience in their own time....Things will getter better...Think of the good things in your life..family that  I'm sure love you.|`|PcpHJvxMaa	i can relate completely with you wen i was a teenager. your teenage years are the hardest years of your life because thats wen your still in a innocent state of thought but being thrown in the real world. you should really keep a positive state of mind. just becuz everyone has a boyfriend doesnt mean your a terrible  person because your not going around messing with guys who your probably not gonna know in ten years. your parents care about you and you should feel fortunate about that becuz unlike many kids out there you have guidance and people that love you ( even though it mite not always feel that way) you should really try to live life one day at a time and try to be more positive|`|0Nfr3leOaa	get a bf or a hobby
JHYwzWSbaa	honestly, i had something like this..i loved her so much..and then suddenly she wanted some other guy...,.don't fall for him!    best option is go to a different club and find an honest guy!    the last thing you want is that guy being with you then finding another girl!|`|Aoj0qVvsaa	First off, find another club to go to. Second, he's obviously using his child as an excuse and that's unacceptable. Cut him loose for good. He's definitely not in your league. Your above that playboy.|`|Q7j5b9R1aa	Where do you get this crap from, so he likes you is he the only one who likes you, for gods sake grow up.|`|6JPiNGdfaa	he is playing|`|ZJohgu1saa	Hmmm i dont know|`|InGWARz9aa	If hes a dj you won't be the only girl being strung along! swerve him lol|`|YSzNTo4Haa	live your life dont feel bad it nature.just no yall should be friends.. till he ready to get with you..|`|UdUNvtIyaa	Sorry - he's not worth it.   You'll find your true love one day and it wont be in a catrophe like this.  He has a child and he shouldnt be cheating realli.....   People who they cheat with are not their true love because he'd tell the girlfriend that theyare over and THEN be with you.|`|lrpG23Ycaa	really? somebody told me that you had a boyfriend that looks like a girlfriend i dated in february last year|`|MOALoKWdaa	jst stay away. avoid his calls his texts and also avoid him at the club. find some one whose compatible for u and also not no cheater. find some one single who has no child or girlfriend. if he likes you then he would of dumped his girlfriend along time ago just for you but yet he stays with her for his child so no luck in getting with him. dont stress over it since theres more fish out in the sea. if he sees u and say hi just tell him hi back but no conversation with him. be a friend not a lover.
tdbNz7bTaa	I mean I could see why they would if they are..they love you and want the best for you. If my friend were dating him.. i probably wouldn't avoid her but i would let her know how I felt and if she didn't see that than just wait until she did.. If he is hurting you verbally or mentally or physically maybe they don't want that for you..|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	You need to provide more information. What else is going on?|`|izbAdDUraa	could you be anymore vague???|`|0rt5oCQCaa	could  be ur boyfriend|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	I would answer but I am avoiding you as well...bye!|`|cG5wZOeBaa	maybe you smell bad|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	certainly this has all to do with the boyfriend, and your friends can see what u cannot. so rather than to see u hurt by this guy, they chose to distance their selves so they won't have to deal with what they think is going to happen. if this were my good friend and they were in a situation to where they could get hurt emotionally as well as physically, i would try to help the friend, but perhaps they have told u how they feel and u are not listening to them, so they feel its best to avoid u.|`|6W7nJYskaa	Maybe they don't like him. Could be why.    Have you showered recently? Could be an smell problem.    Do you hang out with monkeys? Not everyone likes monkeys.    Are you currently set to same polarity as they are? That could be an issue.    :-)|`|YEHVu4tdaa	Hmm, have you had a shower lately?  Might help. Or it could be your skanky boyfriend trying to sell them all drugs.
26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	Wow.  Be a strong, independent woman and let him go.  No contact.  Do not give him your address, phone number and change your email accounts.  No more abortions or sex with men that are not willing to raise a family with you if you get pregnant.  Respect yourself and forgive yourself and move on.  Good luck.  It will be hard but you have no choice.|`|4EWCegiRaa	This situation isn't complicated, you're making it complicated.    All this "sin" talk is useless, it comes down to 1 thing:  Would you rather have him and share him with another woman or not have him at all.      Only you can decide what's right for you.

Any takers?????????????|`|Q7j5b9R1aa	The Zodiac sign has nothing to do with it its how your man uses his coc?k|`|3zm0jA0yaa	I go along with the first answer. Scorpios are suppose to be very passionate. Not only in sex but with life in general. and capricorns have this hidden thing but once you get to know them in a sexual way, you won't be dissappointed. AT ALL
GrXAdJxSaa	In my personal case, about a few weeks before he proposed he became a way over the top with affection and attention... which to me was crazy bc he was always affectionate and attentive to me.. so it got to the point where I thought he all of a sudden had low self esteem or was on something (lol!).. then he started having to go out to dinners and couch shopping w/ his parents and wouldnt give me much info on his outings and ignored me when I would ask about it.. a week later we're engaged.. Now looking back, bc I found out EVERYONE (i mean everyone in my life) knew I was about to get engaged and now all of their weird and shady behaviors all make sense.. so also look for signs outside of your boyfriend.. if I had paid attention to the other people, I probably would've been able to figure it out!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I had no signs we just talked about it from time to time and he proposed to me countless times wherever we were and I said no every time. Then I thought about it and decided that he was the one I wanted and although I would have just lived together (its 2nd time for both of us) he wanted the whole thing.  We are getting married in June in front of 200 guests and have an amazing reception planned for after.  He is my soul mate.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's different for every guy.  It's just whatever he feels the most comfortable with.  Girls could gush abou it all day long LOL.  Mine was we started talking about it, then dragging me into jewelry stores (lol), then he hinted at my ring size, then he was acting weird and then he proposed.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	if he is gonna take you out to eat or somewhere special|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Does he act like he's got a secret?  Are either or both of you over 25? Have you been together for at least a year?  Does he talk more about the future than he used to?  Did he recently ask you for your parents' phone number?  Are all his friends getting married?  Do you have a birthday or important anniversary coming up?  If you answered yes to three or more of those questions, he's probably going to propose real soon.|`|9sKSkKTJaa	So funny, my fiance was beyond obvious. He said things like...When we get married, the next present will be a little square box, all I want for Christmas is you. But anyway.. little things like a special reservations, if he is out and isn't really telling you where or how long he will be, he could be looking at rings, if you know he's been saving money. Those were all of the things that I noticed. I love to be surprised but my guy is such a bad liar. I knew it was coming... but he was still able to surprise me with when. Good luck.
bID1Pd7Gaa	I hope there is not another chapter because I fell asleep while reading this one.|`|76nTvO4iaa	You can't love him enough or be a good enough girlfriend to fix his problems - they have nothing to do with you.    The best thing to do right now is for you to walk away from the situation.  He has to work out his problems, either on his own or with professional help.  It's not your burden to carry and the best thing you can do for him is to step aside and let him deal with him.    I know this is hard, but you can't solve it.    ((hugs))|`|8rLH4YNsaa	I know that exact feeling, my ex changed and has always been like that to this day & i wish i could have that back. You've got to tell him how you feel. Scare him with the thought that you might leave if he carries on the way he has, it might give him a bit of a wake up call.    You sound as tho your doing everything you can. Your being yourself and hes trying to change you into someone you arent. Sounds like hes angry about something, and hes taking everything out on you by putting you down. Dont change who you are for anybody. No matter how much you love them.     Good luck pet x|`|ikeqAESwaa	im thinking that all of these problems r caused by the fight with his mother and the fact that he tried to commit suicide. so the best solution is to give him some time to bring back together his life and u should open up with him and tell him you will always be there for him. Good luck!!!|`|4MnRXiIGaa	I'm sorry for your predicament. It sounds like he's going through some kind of change and doesn't know how to cope. I think the best thing for him is patience and love and space. Give him a lot of space and let him realize what he needs. Don't be sad because you think you're doing something wrong - because you're not. Be the strong one, without being clingy and worrysome, and just let him know you're there for him with your actions. Appreciate him and try to understand where his anxiety and depression is coming from. Good luck!  And don't stress - that's not what either of you need.    And btw, the first poster is a complete asss.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	Your bf sound very very depressed. and he needs professional help.  now when men are soo depressed like this, they will normally not accept going to a psychologist, so I think maybe you should go to a psychologist and ask him what you can do for him, or how you can persuade him to go with you.   I dont think we in yahoo answers can help as much as a psycologist could, because he is so depressed that he even almost killed himself.    All I can say is that he is not hurting you on purpose, he is doing it because he is hurt, and he doesnt even know how muc he is hurting you.    Also he needs you now more than any other time, if he was always sweet and nice, thats how he wants to be, and now he just cant be that because h is really depressed.|`|DtEnHza6aa	sorry was not really bothered reading the whole thing.. so I read the first few lines and then the end..    umm don't do anything.. just see him and talk to him...  there's much you can do anyways..|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	He is making his problems your problems. He's making you walk on egg shells. What he's doing to you is emotionally unhealthy. Try to look at this objectively. What advice would you give your daughter (just pretend you have one) is she came to you with this problem? Now, follow that advise.|`|AubQwF4Baa	Aww sorry this is happening to you!    It seems as if he is very depressed about something, when your depressed even the smallest thing will irritate you.     If its got to the point of him trying to kill himself its time to seek some help, maybe go with him to see someone to discuss whats bothering him, Just be careful on how you approach him because he might be in denial and it will make matters worst, he needs to see someone or at least talk about his issues and try to get them resolved.    Wish you the best of luck.|`|blgRK8Ebaa	have you ever been through something like what he is dealing with?  It can really screw up a persons outlook on life.  The best thing you can do is just be there for him, let him know that you care and eventually he will be okay; he's probably still a little (or a lot) shaken up|`|0d4X54rMaa	your boyfriend is mentally ill  he needs to be under a care of a dr  he is not the person who you think he is    i can only advise you to be careful with your heart here because obviously he is ill but you don't see it    your relationship will never be like it once was.. that part of the dating cycle is over  the question is  are you willing to date a mentally ill person?|`|AA11826328	Wow sweetie you are not alone to a point, look I am not a doctor or anything like that but, you need some help or rather your boyfriend needs some help, I am not for sure what may have happened the night he told you he was in the hospital for trying to kill himself,I will not say nothing bad about your guy because I do not know him nor you personally but, I know guys and it sounds like he is not the same guy you fist met, he has changed and you haven't so you still see the man you fell in love with, and from the sounds of it he is no longer there, and if you love who you are then you must have to decide who you love more, yourself or him?  If he is trying to get you to act in some way that is not you and you are not happy with that then you must decide if you want to be with him that bad. sometimes we as women tend to lose ourselves in a man that is not worthy of our love so then we have to make a choice you have a lot on your mind and no one here can really tell you what to do with your life so there is really know way to make him happy he has to want it for himself......I hope this helps somewhat Good Luck  Lil Angel.....
GeruGGOQaa	You said..."we fight. a lot. we have almost broken up numerous times. he has a bad temper, and i have a nasty attitude."    Um, why do you want to get married to this guy?  Do you want to live the rest of your life fighting all the time with someone who has a bad temper and brings out your nasty attitude?  Why not find someone you don't fight with all the time, doesn't have a bad temper and brings out your nice side?  Or do you like not being happy?|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Not being a jerk but I wonder how much pressure your applying to him. On the other hand you need to state where you want to go with your relationship and after 3 years he should have a good idea where he wants it to go as well.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	First of all, you have already given him your blessing to not get married.  You actually shot off at the mouth and bragged that you didn't need paper to show what you had.  That was your first mistake.    Your second mistake was moving in with him before you had talked about eventually getting married or had "the marriage talk".    Third, you had a baby with him.  You started a family without the benefit of marriage.     These three reasons are why your boyfriend will break up with you before he will marry you.|`|bUuzuBOCaa	I think the best thing to do is not pressure him but show support in him and he will come around.   If he really loves you, he will marry you, maybe not in your time frame but in his.  Hang in there                MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	lay off him . When hes ready he will be ready.  Can't you just love him instead of pressuring the whole situation? If hes not into you that deeply and it has you angry why are you with him? Think about your needs too. Ask yourself this . Would you rather not have him in your life? If he marrys you ,you won't have him if he doesn't want to be there anyway. His mind will be eleswhere. Trust me ...I know !|`|5Gt3ErYNaa	Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?|`|tCI8ksvdaa	Sure, I can give you a different perspective but you probably won't like it.      First, lets examine the facts.  You meet a guy and after a mere 6 month you move in with him.  Three months later you are pregnant.  Don't you think all this is a little to quick?  You should.  You say that when you moved in with him you KNEW that you wanted to spend the rest of you life with him yet you did not know you were fighting all the time and that your relationship was so bed?     To date he has never promised to marry you yet you keep pushing him for marriage.  Now he is giving you BS excuses instead of just being honest and saying he doesn't want to marry you and you just think you are on two different pages?      Lady it is time for you to wake up!  You have been nothing but an immature acting little school girl throwing herself at the feet of a man she has a crush on and now you are starting to realize you have been used!    I suggest you get up, get out, grow up and then try to have a real meaningful relationship with someone who truly cares for you.    But like I said before, you probably don't want to hear this and very most probably will not act on this advice but good luck to you anyway.

f8ON3dRfaa	You either hurt your emo-guy now or later. It's only a matter of time. He will freak out now, he will freak out then. It's how long can you tolerate and accept his huge emotional needs.    Don't be manipulated by his pleadings and don't be taken on a guilt trip. It is sad to know that the foundation of this relationship is based on guilt and not love and understanding.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	PLEASE READ!!! You sound JUST LIKE ME!!! wow...ok...i was 14, dated him for almost 2 years....broke up and it killed me....i dated another guy and he was nice(that's what i thought) but i didn't love him....when he told me he loved me....it discusted me.....and he would get hurt that i didn't say it back(because i loved my first)...and he would tell me, "i would kill myself if we were apart", and "i couldn't live without you".....well, through that relationship....my first love was trying to get me back and i wanted to be with him but i didn't want to hurt the other guy's feelings....THEN....it hit me.....what am i doing dating a person that i like(can't stand him now), when there is someone whom i LOVE VERY MUCH....and they love me.....    I broke up with that guy...and he if fine(he didn't kill himself).....then my first love and I started dating again....now we are engaged to be married and i am VERY HAPPY.......i hope you choose the right one....because in the end....LOVE is the most important....not if you're going to hurt someone's feelings....    OH....and i found out that the other guy wasn't the guy i thought he was.....he is ignorant.....and i'm glad i made the decision that i made....|`|VSb6S6muaa	you never forget your first love, it's perfectly natural.|`|KBU2X921aa	As a preface to this answer, the one thing you have to realize about relationships is that your instincts are always right in these sensitive situations. And in this case, you have implied that your original boyfriend is the person you want to truly be with. If you dont want to hurt your current boyfriend, you have to sit him down and get everything out on the table. That is the only way he will ever really understand how you feel, and accept your decision. Honesty is key in relationships, and even if your current bf doesn't agree with your decision, he has to respect it.
y9CgveCGaa	With my cell phone service, I can see who I send and receive messages from and when.  But, you can't see the actual messages themselves.    To see a list of when messages were sent and received and what the number where you go to the online bill and look at data details.  I have Verizon.|`|asxqampCaa	You can start or log in to an existing online account for the phone with your phone service provider.    From the main page, you usually click a 'My Account Details' button - most providers keep text messages for 90 days.    If you aren't sure how to do it on the Internet, call your service provider and ask them to mail you a printout of the past 90 days of phone numbers called and text message activity. They'll be happy to do so.    Now for the fun phone game - when you get the list, have him put his phone on speakerphone and start dialing all the numbers. Free entertainment when you hit 'her' number!     WARNING: Be prepared to hurl toasters and other appliances at him if you play this game.|`|4WOCDS9taa	aim.|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	what does it matter.
tCI8ksvdaa	NO this is not suspicious.  It is a message as plain as day, he is cheating.|`|db440e48d3204833c920aa88aab4ed5daa	Well you for sure have it right in front of your face yes he is doing something and when he is alseep you need to check his phone or make sure you see the statement .|`|MDSoBHeXaa	Yes.|`|qofIr9yFaa	YES!!!  Dr. Phil says "people with nothing to hide, hide nothing."|`|ssK4oJi9aa	i see that there could be a problem but suspicion and the breakdown of trust and communication is the bigger problem and there are a few things that you can do about that.|`|OFnVbxcAaa	Yes. He does not want you to hear his conversation. He is not a very good cheater/liar. You should approach him about it.|`|3dpdQssvaa	great|`|wGw834Gkaa	Yes, I think you are right, I mean, what would you be doing if you were acting like this?|`|YjZJBDY2aa	It sounds like he is seeing someone behind your back and doesn't want to get caught.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Oh dear. When he is in the shower or not around, grab that phone and find out who he is calling, texting... Maybe get someone to follow him to where he goes after work.     Sorry...|`|LydL7EN6aa	this sounds kind of fishy. talk to him and see what he says|`|HxbLwCEKaa	Don't ask us, ask him.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Yes, he is hiding something from you.  You need to talk to him about it.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	either he is planning to surprise you with something special or he is planning to cheat|`|C4bxnKDXaa	my goodness dont be naive...if he is keeping it a secret...he is hiding something. There should be no secrets in a marraige...he should be able tot alk to whoever he was talking to in front of you.     It could be a surprise for you though...I dont know how long hes been doing this?|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	I smell a dirty rat - and it's your husband and his action.  Don't you EVER ask him what he's doing?  Of course this is suspicious!     Are you afraid of him?  When he goes to sleep, get his cell phone and look at the last few numbers he has dialed, especially the last one. then check it out.|`|AA11085356	Sorry to say it, but it does sound like he is trying to hide something from you... Try to sit him down and just ask about it. But Be careful not to sound like you are accusing him of anything, you don't kno what he is doing. Just be curious, see if he tells you. If not, maybe look at his phone records and see who it is he is talking to.|`|8txWayVnaa	Girl, that's Cheating 101.    Get your hands on his cell phone bill, and look for frequent calls made/received from number(s) you don't recognize.  Don't call the numbers. . .do a reverse look-up on-line.  If the number comes up private, you may have to pay about $15 for the information (each phone number, if there's more than one).    If it's innocent, great.  If not, then you have something to work with when confronting him.    Good luck.|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	yes, it sounds like he is absolutely hiding something from you|`|btrMdy5Uaa	He seems to be hiding something to me|`|PaNqxZRtaa	Ask him, look at his cell phone. Are you sexually active? Maybe that's wassup|`|ppF6oSCQaa	Of course he's hiding something.  I'd have him followed.|`|76cAAPfBaa	Sure sounds like he's hiding something. The issue now, is what is he hiding, and is it something you should worry about. Get your hands on his cell phone, and check his call log for frequent numbers. Then, find out who they belong to, and go from there.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	You really need to ask someone else when you already know???|`|bUuzuBOCaa	He is definitely talking to another woman.  I did this myself so I know he is doing the same thing too.             MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|WLvGFqAwaa	He is absolutely hiding something.  Have you asked him about this?  If he gets defensive, it probably means he is lying to you.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Yes! If he can't even talk inside, he's obviously trying to hide something.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Is it noisy in the house when the kids are awake?    Is he always home and in bed with you at bedtime?    Have you asked him why he goes outside to take his phone calls?|`|j2yhjBDiaa	Why don't you ASK HIM?|`|JBLcMQ9haa	That's definitely what it sounds like to me. You should definitely confront him about it. Apparently he thinks you are too dumb to realize this. GAH! MEN!!|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Yes it sounds like he is hiding something from you, and he's doing a terrible job of it!  Standing out on the streetcorner in the chill?  Thats a dead giveaway.  Either he's not very good at being sneaky, or whatever he's up to isnt what you think.  Perhaps planning some sort of surprise, or something ?  Or is that wishful thinking?  You know him better than us.  I'd watch him for a while.  See what he gets up to.  If you ask him straight out if he's cheating, he'll probably just lie and you'll be twisted in knots not knowing either way.  If there is evidence to find, you will find it.. and if there's not, then give him the benefit of doubt.|`|QWSBnQcfaa	I would think YES! If you don't know anything about this repeated behavior then he is hiding something from you. I am the world's worst about giving the benefit of the doubt to someone special but the truth is the truth. My biggest regret is letting myself be put thru the pain of being the last one to know when it is truly obvious what is happening. After that, you just don't feel like you deserve any better. And if he's hiding phone calls, what makes you think he's won't hide more important issues? I would run to a professional ASAP! I will pray for you.
WLvGFqAwaa	For him to do that in front of your children especially means he is a jerkass.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	That she must be pretty effing hot.....what's a jerkass?|`|zwaCsOeVaa	I think the bigger question is, "Is you speak English?"    What is your question, yo?|`|yZqRYFsPaa	lol no i think they were just having fun and she probly thinked why are these guys staring at me?|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	No you are over-reacting.  If an old creepy guy walked passed my window or an elephant or krusty the clown or a hot girl I would stop and stare most likely.  If she thought he was checking her out she would be like "Hmm, I still got it" or be flattered, so dont worry about how she feels and dont worry about your husband.  Go take a chill pill and then go make your husband some ice tea.  I bet he is thirsty from playing with the kids.|`|h2vIOmDgaa	While he needs to hide it a little better I don't think he's a jerk. I think you have nothing to worry about, men or women we all look at a hot member of the opposite sex. Men just really suck at doing it!|`|AA10030524	If that is the worst thing he has done...consider yourself lucky. The only thing that would stop him from looking is if he were gay or blind. Even very old men who no longer have sex still look.Quit tormenting yourself...you can't change nature.|`|0n0zw1Sfaa	well i think shes is a nosey *****|`|vs8xxWEnaa	she is probably having an affair with him.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	she would think hubby appreciates beauty and he was good for showing the kids how to do the same...|`|PhNzEkVnaa	She is probably thinking what you are thinking !!|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	LOL. Sounds like he's human. As long as he's just looking, what's the harm.    If it was the beautiful neighbor man, I bet you'd be looking.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Men are always going to look.  She's probably used to it.  You should be too!|`|AA11180444	Who cares, it's your house, right?  If you cared about anything it should be why she was looking in your windows?|`|0Dbjv10iaa	Honestly who cares what she thought? What did you think? That's all that matters.

There is nothing wrong with looking at nice art just don't take it off the wall. I do the same whenever I see an attractive man. Its only fair. Stop feeling threatened, put the whip away and get more confidence. There are worse things he could be doing.|`|XzHjeFKYaa	forget about what the lady thought... think about what the hell your kids thought. that was rude to your kids. yeap.. jerkass...|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	how old are the kids?

Just saying maybe he wasn't the only one looking|`|uI4Dspi4aa	what? who cares|`|VmQBhY6iaa	That she's sooo dammm HOT! and as far as ur husband,hey he's a man! don't be too surprise.|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	Well maybe not a Jerkass but atleast he should be more discreet about it if he wants to look and she is probably thinking " Yes, I look Good" or if she's like me she is probably thinking " Are you serious? Come on you have a Wife!!!"     Seriously I think all men do that. I catch my hub doing it too and I just play along, its not worth getting upset, as long as he gives you your spot as his wife.|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	I hope your sons are small!|`|KZMezu7oaa	Jerkass? That's the first I've heard that one....|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	What is a jerkass?    Anyway, it's human nature for men to stare at women. However, there is a tactful way of doing it. What your husband did was not tactful.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	she must be pretty hot, that does not mean he is a jerkass whatever that is|`|hneetSf2aa	damn thats wrong|`|tOdjjeAmaa	She probably expected it cause she knows she's beautiful.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	you're overreacting, big time.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	He is just being a man|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	It's nice he was playing with the kids, but TOTALLY wrong to ogle the the neighbor passing by.

E2BeVNkIaa	Well, for one thing, as for the coming into your room, ask your mom if you could make a pretty sign that says "Please Knock" and if everyone in the house would knock before comming in. (Do this before you make the sign), so when your sister comes in, go to your mom politely and say "I asked everyone to follow the rules of knocking before comming in, because I am getting older, and what if I'm changing and she bursts in? Little Sally (or whatever her name is) just ignores the rules. Please talk to her about it?|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	try reasoning with her when that fails lock her in a closet until she says she is sorry|`|2vH6VktWaa	Nice to know I'm not alone!  If you stick a video recorder in her face she will go away - works for me :P    lol xx|`|gUscgmroaa	you talk too much|`|ZRYZvcgNaa	hahaha most definatly do not kill her  but!  i have that problem too  sometimes what im taught is that these kids love when you flip out  if you just ignore her  and i know thats really really hard, trust me  she will kinda back off cause its not as fun anymore  just keep being a completely good sister  and maybe he can learn from you!!!!|`|t2YUn4FYaa	wow im actually greatful 2 be an only child. Stick up 2 her say if she wants 2 be a snob 4 no reason go ahead but find someone else 2 do it 2, u  always get what u want but not with me cause im not a brat. Go away and just stay away  from me. hope it works!! Sometimes u have to be mean-er|`|F6U9eM6Gaa	first of all i have a sister the same way.  What i would do if talk to your perants about it tell them that your really upset and you really don't even want to be around her any more also mention that she's 8 and you think that by this time she should be a little more mature by now.  if you have more questions you can e-mail me at  zeldahambone@gmail.com  thanks|`|JaiepxZ2aa	kill her|`|Nu26tJ9faa	look straight into her eyes and talk with a ferm voice and lecture her about respect if she doesn't listen then just tell your parents i have a big sister shes 13years older than me she really is a great sister but the funny thing is i never thought i could argue with her thats why i never tried. but i did annoy her but i didn't know i was annoying her lol.|`|TclyXi8qaa	Some kids just take time to mature and develope manners, i know it's difficult but most kids go through this phase. She'll grow out of it. Talk to your parents about it in a calm manner so nobody gets angry. Also if you say to a child, 'I just want to give you a small talk on how you are acting' then it will annoy them and it will make them feel belittled or patronised. I'm 15 and i know how i behaved when i was younger and i wasn't very well behaved. I grew out of it pretty quickly though.   Good luck. Also.. don't let her twist you around her little finger by always buying her things and treating her like a little princess. Reward her for good behaviour and ignore her when she wants attention and plays up.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Is it something related to marriage and divorce? Sure its not thats why u didnt get any answers yet, so change the category to get better answers.    _K_|`|lFQiiR0Baa	I haven't, sorry.
rbzoNe12aa	Sounds good to me. I was about to say you should ask him out for a drink but considering you're 20 that isn't an option. Maybe you can find a similar sort of situation though. The reason a drink is so perfect is because it is low pressure and can be seen as a friendly invite. It allows you to feel out the situation and see if the other person is interested. And, if it goes horribly, you're not sitting there for an hour and a half having dinner on a bad date. As far as a girl asking a guy out, I love it.|`|66l0BPhaaa	there is nothing wrong with asking him out. if he is single, then there is no problem. go for it, he should be flattered and it will benefit the both of you. go for it, my wife asked me out on our first date, four years ago. in those two minutes that you see him, stop him and let him know you would like to talk to him so please make a little time to talk. or just stop him and say slow down, i really would like to take you out to dinner tonight or whenever you are available. the way you have ask would work also, just change you should come with me, with i want you to join me to dinner.|`|A4G03Bzbaa	I like it.|`|DtEnHza6aa	yeah umm..|`|54saG0LWaa	Be straight forward ! say i wanna hang out this weekend with a good frnd , would you come with me?    Don't discuss that who will pay but carry ur wallet along, grab the chance to pay ur bill..if possible,,otherwise let him pay that's good actually !|`|0zjrVM8Naa	Just ask him if he would like to go to lunch.  Then later maybe ask him to the movies.  Say, "I would really like to get to know you."  Try the restaurant thing, it will definitely work.
xHxi9p0Vaa	What kind of work does he do for a living? Sometimes as wives, we should look at the bigger picture. There is nothing wrong with us taking on the "housework", even if we also work outside the home. What about things he does take care of? Car maintenance? Oil changes? Yard work? Unclogging toilets? If he does take care of things like that, is it really such a bad thing if he doesn't do the dishes or laundry? I do agree though, he should absolutely pick up after himself.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Tell him that if he wants you to do the housework, that you will need to quit or work less hours. Otherwise you need to share.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	You need to tell him you need help! Lay down the law!|`|1BGwGFQZaa	Then You Need To Stay at home since that has become a fulltime gig also. Tell him that if u stayed home you would not mind being the captain of the ship but since you work full time also that the two of you need to work together for the home to wiork effectively. Allow him to take on these chores. If nothing Changes Stop Cooking for him. Just cook for yourself and the kids.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	You both have to come to an agreement. You will need to compromise. Let him know how you feel and that you need help. If that doesn't help then let the chores go for a few days and see what he says or does. Also, if you have kids and they are old enough, get them involved.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Just as your husband can choose not to help, you can choose not to do everything.  Do what you want to do and leave the rest. You can ask him specifically, "Will you please run the vacuum?" and see how that goes. You can also tell him, "We work the same number of hours and I need your help to get the housework done." BUT even if he doesn't help you, you can choose not to do it all. If cleanliness is important to him, eventually he will help you. My husband cleaned the toilet for the first time since we've been married because I quit doing it. I'm not the one who gets it so dirty, and I got tired of being the ONLY one who cleans it. You have to be willing to let it be dirty for a while, but this is a long-term project. When he does some work, praise him like he's a three year old.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Why are you doing it?    I stopped doing everything and started gathering up his stuff and messes and put them all in his closet.  Caused a little drama at first, but it has worked.  I like a clean house.  It's not important to him, and in fact, I don't think he ever really saw his messes.    Now, all his dirty dishes make it to the sink.  I still have to put them in the dishwasher, but it sure beats having to run all over the house and pick up after him.  And the resentment that resulted wasn't good for our marriage either.  His dirty clothes make it into the hamper, or close to it.  He doesn't dust, vacuum, do laundry, or the bathrooms, but he has gotten much better at just picking up after himself.    It saved our marriage.  I really don't think he had any concept of how much work his little messes were until they were all piled up inside of his closet.  It was messy, but it helped.  Now, the house is clean enough for me, and he appreciates the work I put into it.|`|yy45iAbtaa	you should be happy in these times you both still ave jobs stop complaining.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	This is a roommate problem, not a marriage problem.  Determine what your half of the housework is and do that and only that.  Let him stew in his own juice for a while and he'll turn into a housekeeper.  Remind him that slavery was abolished years ago!|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	better get to work then...|`|GeruGGOQaa	Doubt he just became this way.  This is one of those things you should have found out about him before getting married.  You could try laying down the law but don't be surprised if he ignores your attempt at enforcing the new laws.|`|nKosOzuVaa	Maybe stop doing some things he leaves up to you, that way he'll bite the bullet and actually do those things?    I do all the laundry in my house but I generally load the dishwasher and leave the dishes that need to be hand washed. My guy will only let them sit so long before he takes care of them.    Something else I read, squirt a little cleaner in a room he's in, the scent is supposed to work on his subconscious, to get him motivated. Then ask him to help with something and maybe he'll get a little more involved.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	You said all he does is work.  Does he have to put in more hours than you?  If so, that should be taken into consideration. Marriage and housework is never 50/50. You need to talk with him and tell him how you feel and try to work out a compromise.   Either that or go on strike to make a point that the housework doesn't get done unless someone does it and you need help.  Does he do other things, like yard work and car maintenance?  How was he raised?  Some men are raised in households where the woman does all of the inside work. Maybe he doesn't know how to do housekeeping.|`|xVMtfuWPaa	my hus is like that too. in fact when i get home from work he just sits there all day...doesn't cook clean.. nothing.. when he gets home everything is ready for him. what i do is at night when it's couple time.. i'm too tired to do anything so i telll him if he helps me more in the house... we can have sex...if not good night don't bother me. try it... it might work. that'll get him motivated.|`|HOAQtDDzaa	Depends..who works more hours.  Be resonable with each other, if your work outside the house keeps you outside for equal time then tell him to get off his ***.|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	tell him to hire a cleaning person. you are not his maid, or when he asks you why the house is a mess tell him to get off his *** and clean it himself then go out shopping.|`|nlQiRHRJaa	In a relationship it should be 50/50 with everything even house work ,so maybe you should talk to him and ask him to help you out   it's not fair  that you have to do it all yourself.    well good luck|`|XzHjeFKYaa	hi,  some men think no matter what the house is the womans work...     Try this, get a white board, and post it. break out the chores, or what you want him to do. write it down from him to see. you really have to treat them like a child. BUT..., make sure that when he does do what you want him too,,, always say thank you, show him how much you appreciate him for doing it. Dont nag at him, or he wont do it, just break it down something he can see. post it on the icebox.  post what you will do and what he will do. Try that. and just see.
JlDcVTVsaa	It really good that they have accepted your son, thats usually the most difficult part.  that means they do accept you too, but i think as your finance told you, they feel bad for their father.  and they are in between this, maybe they feel by letting you in the family they are betraying their father.     You should do what your finance told you, because surly she knows them better, also dont give up. be there and show them that you care for them and you are not the enemy, also maybe you should ask their mother to talk to them and tell them you being there doesnt change any thing between her and her ex, and even if you were not there they still wouldnt be together, and they are just helping the mom by accepting you there.    but you should stay patient, and just dont give up, also show them how much you love and care for their mom.    good luck:)|`|iJqYC0vkaa	why has she told you not to reprimand them is my ? back to yo. We have a very blended family here. his hers and ours. The kids were 10 (his) 9 (hers) when we married. Ours came a year later. My thought was if I trust this guy fully to marry him, live with him and share my life , it also meant our kids. Kids between age 12-20+ are pains anyway (from experience) but you and your fiance can't have a divided front. Because let me tell you as they grow a bit more, you will find it is you two against them. And it will be war! Our boys are now 25,24 and 14. And the war is finally over with the older 2, but we have just started with the 14 yo. It is him or us.   Your fiance has to have trust in you for the marriage to work. Plain truth. If she doesn't trust you with the kids there will be other areas of distrust. Not  a jealousy but she might always be holding back something out of fear.   Just a few things to think about.|`|oKExTm8paa	If your fiancee does not want you to reprimand them, there's not much you can do. I'm surprised you stayed in this situation so long. If you feel unwanted in your own home, this might not ever change.    You have taken on quite a lot of problems that are not of your making. It can only get worse. Is the woman really worth it? I'd think long and hard about this situation and get some advice from a counselor. You have to think of you own son in all this too.    You sound like a very nice man who is caught in a bad situation.
MLdykhQNaa	Well without school you wouldn't be asking this question because you wouldn't be able to read or write.  That should be enough right there.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Are you serious with this?  Why would you want to be a dumb head?|`|66l0BPhaaa	Questions like this one is the reason why you need to go to school. Imagine life and the world without school, how fu-cked up this place would be. I know somebody that does go to school, knows every rap song, every movie, and every car, but can not even read, write, or count money, tell time, and that is not a pretty sight. She asked the same question, but can not even write it out. She is going to be 20 years old, yes she has a learning disability, but she is not dumbass, that is how i see it.|`|1aYKV8Nzaa	You are ridiculous! What the heck kind of question is that. I'm not even to give you an answer because it is so stupid.|`|ERAvvezmaa	Well..  If we didn't go there wouldn't be people like doctors and other important people. No deplomas and things, no life outside of dumbness. The world would be dumb, and only know about sex.  So if you want your world to be like that, than continue asking these questions.    Hope this helps|`|crKCWOxXaa	To get an education duh|`|Bfd5LOrdaa	To learn maybe?  To have the qualifications to specialise in a job?  Just think; if doctors never went to school there would be NO such thing as doctors, so we'd all die from an illness.    Why did you have to ask this question?  Answer that for me dumb ***.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	You know how you can type n stuff? Its because school taught you that... and if you stay longer.. they will teach you even more great stuff..
P4Jc76GPaa	Ok you have me confused. For starters he didn't use a condom. Are you pregnant or do you think you are pregnant. With that said, your boyfriend is jealous of you around other guys. He thinks he will lose you to them. as for him ravishing you that's his male animal instincts to take what is his (that's what he believes). As for the noises he made the night before I can only imagine that they sounded like that to you, but sounded different in his head. As for breaking up with him that's up to you. I think he still likes you, but that he's afraid of losing you. I'm still confused :) Just kidding. Good luck.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Yea I'd never let something like that happen, you couldve pushed him off you and told him you were going to call the police if he didnt stop. I'm sure you wanted it and I KNOW you knew he had no condom on the second he put it in you. I know what it's like to be in the heat of the moment I'm sure you wanted it just as much as he did. To bad it was with someone who seems to be such a loser. Yes break up with him and I'd try to get the day after pill at planned parenthood if it's still less then 3 days after the incident. I'm 23 and I met my fiance now the first day I had sex with him with no protection out of heat of the moment, I wanted it bad and I got it, now I'm 5 months pregnant, but good thing my mans a good man with a good job and he tells me everyday he'd have no one else but me. So, again I'm sorry it was with someone like your guy. Pregnancy is a whole nother level of something I've never known and I really dont think I'dve been able to handle it when I was 17. I hope you make the right decision in the end.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Ok first of all  If you feel that things are not right with you why are you sleeping with him at all?  Have some respect for yourself.  Second off he doesnt sound like a catch to me at all.  Id dump him and move on.   And Id think before sleeping with someone who does not respect me.|`|ERAvvezmaa	Sorry, but do what to you?    The do me part, or the bum pinch part.  If it's the bum pinch part than his just jelouse that other guys look at you (drunk or not).  And the do me part, boy do that all the time. They expect the girl to do everything, even in the bedroom.  You and him just need to take a break from all of this. You know, take a break from eachother a bit.    And by the way, are you ok about getting pragnant cause you can take the morning after pill (if it's the morning after).    Any way, just take a break, sort yourself out. His probably just being a boy.    Hope this helps.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	people do stupid things when they are drunk. You have assured your b/f that there was nothing wrong, and he has accepted that. Though, in saying that, what he did in the bedroom after, might be him "securing his mark", that you are his. I think he does care about you. With respect to " obviously you are pregnant", not necessarily, i think you should get a pregnancy test and use it, else go to your doc. If you are going to be with your b/f and have spontaneous sex, then you had better have a word with your doc about better protection.
nr1Bt47baa	Don't ever take a guy back if he is cheating on you. He does not love you and if he did love you a long distance relationship would not matter. They got movies and stuff for that. Don't take him back and don't even call him, he is worthless, your doing the right thing. Stay strong and focus your love to your child. Good luck!|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Men are human, not machines. So the answer is yes.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Girl, let me tell you something! You deserve better than that! There are plenty good men who are willing to take in a care for a woman and her child. So you move on, and find you someone else. If he really loved you he wouldn't cheat on you.     *Just curious...how did you get pregnant if you are long distance?|`|SmFVG8eXaa	I think he believes that he can do whatever he wants because you'll be waiting around for him. Put an end to this cycle.. don't take him back.. Allow him to see the child but I think you're relationship needs to be put on hold.  If he really loved you, he wouldn't be with other women.. plain and simple.  You're making excuses for him and thats not fair to you. Don't you think you deserve better???|`|EBjyMCeCaa	Yes, he can love you and cheat. But that means he doesnt love you enough to be faithful to you and you and your child derserve more.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Of course it's possible.  Love is a deeper emotion than sex and while he MIGHT (and I stress might) still love you he has sexual needs and a long distance relationship is the perfect one to have it both ways.  I have yet to know of a long distance relationship to last unless the couple are married.  In your case it sounds like the typical cheater and I think your best bet would be to find another boyfriend and be done with this guy.  He sounds like a real piece of work with no morals.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|2q6JtPiBaa	yes they can, sumtimess ppl make mistakes, as long as the mistake is nt repeated then you should giv him the benifit of the doubt. sumtimes even if you love sumone it's jst nt meant to be|`|kgUzdfqVaa	He can certainly love you. He may love you with all his heart. Unfortunately some people will still cheat, especially in long distance relationships where the person is literally 'distanced' from their loved one - and so does not feel so connected to their wrong doings.  This does not mean these actions are forgivable - if your boyfriend is cheating on you then they are too selfish/immature for a relationship, & do not fully appreciate what they have.  I think that because you have a child together, you need to try to work something out. This doesn't mean getting back together with your boyfriend, but it does mean talking to one another about how you are going to share the responsibility of the child.|`|3QiKTfqeaa	basically! men and women have needs. a need to be physically close and within reach. its ok to be apart for a short while but week after week.. after week. it can be to tough for a man. and even some women. you have a baby to keep you busy.. to love you and kiss you and smile. he has nothing but other women. im sure he would rather it be you, but a man will be a man. probably the reason im still single.  waiting on that man who can endure!     good luck to you and your darling baby!
f8ON3dRfaa	Compromise.    Tell bf that you're just normal friends.  Don't go too close to ex-bf.    Learn to set boundaries for your ex-bf. Meaning, he can text you and email you, but no meeting up for dates and chatting on phone. Set your own boundaries and let bf know.    If he demands no contact at all, and if you love bf, tell ex-bf that you're sorry but you have to draw the line.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	If you want to stay together then the two of you have to sit down and talk it out calmly.  Communication is the key in every good relationship.  There can't be trust without communication.  He's jealous of your ex.  He sees him as a threat of taking you back and you going for it.  This needs to be settled in his mind.  My wife has an ex she calls as much as she can and they even had a lunch date not too long ago but it didn't bother me.  I know she's with me for the rest of my life and her ex is married too.  They are just great friends.  Your guy can't stop you from having male friends.  It's something that he's just going to have to deal with.  Maybe you should either take the two of them out to dinner or even better yet make them both a dinner and show your man there is nothing to worry about.  The two of them can be friends too.    If he refuses to let you have your own friends then maybe it's time to find another boyfriend but you should give your guy the chance before you break up.    I really hope this helps, good luck.|`|Gburbcuiaa	Break up but don't date your ex. There's a reason he is your ex.|`|DtEnHza6aa	break up..|`|Iq1R5ehvaa	it sounds like your boyfriend is jealous. i have a friend like your ex, except, he's not really an ex... b/c we weren't really "together." he, Jase, is just a really close guy friend and we are "there" for each other when times get hard (at sometimes more physically than emotionally). my boyfriend doesn't like that we WERE physically there for each other (not any more - I don't want anyone but my boyfriend) but is more than happy for me to talk with Jase on an emotional level.   i think you should explain to your boyfriend that your relationship with your ex is a FRIENDSHIP, and there is no longer any physical feelings for him. and if that doesn't work then girlie... your guy probably won't ever change. i would start looking for a new one, who respects the fact that you can turn past relationships into friendships.|`|M495ou9waa	There's nothing wrong with being friends with an ex boyfriend. I'm pretty sure your current boyfriend is just jealous and he probably feels that he might lose you because you might go crawling back to the ex. If he can't understand that you guys are just friends than he probably isn't mature enough to be in a relationship.
f8ON3dRfaa	No I don't think you actually liked him.    All along this guy has been supportive of you even after you broke up with your bf. Perhaps you started to feel all alone and not supported when he confessed he stopped having feelings for you.     First you're down when your bf broke up with you and went to another girl. On top of that, someone who once liked you tell you in your face he no longer have such romantic feelings for you. It's like a double stab. But no, I don't think you actually like him at all to begin with. Maybe you like his attention and now feel like no-one seems to like you anymore.    You know it's not true and you can't based it on these 2 boys alone.     You'll find someone who knows how to appreciate you someday.
wzXJOSIeaa	Honesty is a BIG one. But girls often look at the little things like if he can make her laugh, or if she feels safe in his arms. It's so much more than looks and finances. I for one am not a shallow girl and my boyfriend is not the cutest guy in the world but he can make me laugh and I just enjoy spending time with him.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Bottom line, someone who makes me feel like the only woman in the world.  I want to know there is something different about me that drew that person to me.  Then I would really like him to be good looking, shallow but there.  Then good job, money, etc.|`|hXFndli2aa	Well you have mentioned them all i think those are important qualities to look for in a man, and a woman is lucky if she finds a man with all those qualities.   -HOnesty: because you want to be able to trust your man and know that he is always saying the true  -Love: is essential to lead a happy relationship cuz you  want passion right!  -Finances: also essential you can't live off love, money helps keep your marriage happy  -Looks: also important you wanna be physically attracted to your partner so he won't have wandering eyes.  -Commitment: also a must you wanna know that he is your and your his number one in his heart, mind all of the above.|`|EmMxNWyLaa	funny  serious  good job  good person  sweet  caring|`|DtEnHza6aa	Talent..|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Honesty n love|`|24fyNeyOaa	commitment love and honesty|`|DABa3Cjyaa	Well it's different to each women, for me I would say :    ~Commitment  ~Love  ~Honesty  ~Humor  ~Fun  ~Understanding    I hope I helped, by the way, it doesn't matter about the looks, it matters how you act and make her feel.|`|yWROYbZAaa	I look for someone who is HONEST (which is most important). They also have to have a job and a car so they wont be dependent on a women. They have to be sweet and know what they want out of life. Also they have to respect others.
AA11123333	You havent provided many details for us to respond to..but from what you HAVE said, it seems like whatever you did is not easy to forgive and forget by the other person.    If whatever you both did broke up the relationship, then it's not worth it, so just let it go, whatever it is.    You apologized and that's about as much as you can do.  Just move on.|`|I8iFm8Qkaa	Well, you said you apologized for your part. And that's really all you can do. Everything else will just play out. In time, they'll figure out that what they did wasn't right and that they should of taken some of the blame.. It's not your whole battle to fight. It's not all on you.|`|K635IdQ4aa	Details???? You play,,, you pay....|`|bVbBo1X0aa	The Cherokee Indians have this belief that there resides in us two wolves. One is distrustful and attacks everything near it out of fear. The other is strong and lives its life free to go where ever it wants. What determines which of the wolves rules our lives depends on which one you feed.    Be the wolf who is free and move onto better hunting grounds.
Kx2P8Hikaa	Ask another girl and have a double-date. Maybe she'll get jealous and realize she only wants you for herself.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Shes crying because she is a nice person, and is upset your upset that she is not interested in you. Shes not into you, and you made her uncomforatable. She doesnt like you or she would of asked you, its not brain surgery, its knowing when to accept that someone doesnt like us and likes someone else.|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	relax with the overdramatics.  she's just a girl and she likes the other dude.  she is trying to tell you this garbage story so you feel less bad, but the truth is she is attracted to that guy (who had the balls to hit on her) and not you.  stop being so selfless and don't worry about remaining friends.  make sure your needs are met instead of catering to her.  find a girl who actually cares about you (not her).  man up.|`|vlEeaB4baa	She's been crying all day cause she hurt your feelings, but you won't back off.  Dude, if she was interested in you, and she knew you liked her, she would have asked you first.  She does not like you... and she's crying because she doesn't have the heart to tell you, so you need to give her space and just accept the fact that she wants to be friends.  I have been in this situation before a few times and it's hell.  Especially when you are friends with someone who wants more because you never mean to hurt them.  It makes it strange and just weird.|`|GxCfbn94aa	For now i think that both of you are not ready for a relationship and maybe she does have feelings for you but they havent developed yet. For now i think it would be best for you to just stay strong and suggest that you both just be good friends for now. When the time is right she will realize she likes you and then you guys will be together. until then keep the friendship strong and try and see other people because you never know who will take your breath away when you dont even know it!! good luck!|`|Au7GEfQiaa	She is probably just afraid that if you guys do go out that if things dont work out she will loose you as a friend. And if she said she cared about you, that would be a great loss to her.|`|JW0qV2cZaa	OMG!!!! Thats like a total bummer!|`|nEw1ZccTaa	stayong friends isn't a good idea. you'll be too jealous|`|42IzT0Viaa	Stop being a whiny little idiot, accept that its her life and her turnabout invitation, then man up, laugh it off and stop trying to meddle in her "love life"|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	well she probably just wants to go with a friend & not have to worry about "feelings" and shyt.  everyone needs one night to just party.  but give her space.  ..crowding is a red flag..  you should go with a friend too.   she'll come around.|`|uVcXFWDFaa	being friends isnt an option it just wont work you will both be 2 jealous of each other and it will stop you from doin things just so you dont hurt each others feelings. the only option is to stop being friends as much as that sucks its the only option...|`|lGKMa38Oaa	if she asked him just as friends then you shouldnt have anything to worry about. trust me... when a girl says something like "we are going just as friends" she usually means it! i would know. im a girl. just let them go to turnabout together and pretend like it never happend. just keep doing what your doing in your friendship and you never know...you just might end up together.     and about her worrying about you... tell her not to and let her know that you are always there for her and support her no matter what she does. let her know that she can come to you with anything, that way she feels that you are trustworthy and she will grow closer to you.     give it time. things just might turn out your way. :)|`|02CeuJtCaa	its hard to stay friends when you are not supporting her to go out with another guy.  if you'll be like this, she'll never actually find the one she loves.  you'll keep getting in her way like this.    the best way is to just let her go.  let her be with anyone she pleases.  it may hurt but its whats best for you and her if u want to remain friends|`|6US6xhH9aa	It sounds like she still cares about you. Maybe you should try talking to her and tell her that its ok that she didn't ask you to the turnabout. After all she is going just as friends with that other guy. Its not like there a couple. just be there for her when she needs you and maybe she will wanna be more then just friends.|`|ra7K71yPaa	Space is the only way to fix this. You need to give her, and yourself plenty of space for the next few weeks. Wait until after turnabout. Go with another girl, and have fun. Don't let her hold you back, and don't hold her back. After you give yourselves a little time, you guys can talk about whether or not you want to remain friends... or risk your friendship into a relationship.  But for now, the only way to fix your situation is to avoid her for a while, it will work out.
bVQJAS22aa	Try as hard as you possibly can to stop. Think about others and how you are hurting them. Talk to your gardian about it or maybe even a teacher that you really trust. Pray. Only if  you are religious. It would help if you were though. If you have never praied before then there is a first time for everything right?!?! Well I really hope that I could help. Bye!|`|thTV5Qi2aa	Oh God..you know?   now you are doing it with "ME" !|`|1JvC68eSaa	Umm What's the secret? And when someone calls u a bad word I can almost guarentee you will want to quit.
L6cywARAaa	Siblings all have the same blood. Step's are step children not siblings.   Step sister and step brother. Sibling have your same blood from your biological mom and biological dad.  Got it Good!|`|AA12157801	Yes, but not biologically.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	To me step-siblings raised together are siblings.|`|NoT3WGaEaa	They are siblings you hillbilly.|`|qVt6wJqMaa	Yeah, they're part of the family now, so yes, they count|`|JoU7WTadaa	They're considered as step siblings. Yes, they are siblings. So I miiiight be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm not.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	siblings are brothers and sisters....thats all. you consider your stepbrother your brother? than he's your sibling.  When a person ask you who is the boy next to you, you dont have to say stepbrother, you can say he's your brother. It's nobody's business. I know people that are closer to their stepbrothers than their actual brothers.  Dont think too much. They are in your life and thats all that matters
Sl0iE8cbaa	she needs to tell her parents or school counselor what happened. It is NEVER okay to just let something like that slide. It is not your friends fault that this guy is risking his life and children's security by doing what he did. If the kids lose their dad that is his fault NOT hers!! Tell!!|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	i would talk to the friend who's hosue you were at. see what they say.|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	OMG!! He needs a new wife then, so that he can touch her all he wants. But if that was to happen to me, I would never ever go back there again, tell her that. But if she can't do that too, then I don't know what to do anymore.|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	Your friend needs to tell her parents and follow the proper channels with law enforcement.  Tell your friend he could be doing this to her friend and her friend is to scared to tell.  No matter what your ages, this is illegal and damaging.  I give this to you out of experience with my own uncle.  Also, if your friend doesn't speak up, tell your parents what you know.  She will be mad at first and it will be hard but trust me in the end, it is for the best.  Move now before it gets worse.|`|l65lzB6paa	you must report him.  your bf should tell her parents and file charges..that is not right....AT ALL. your friend should appreciate you guys standing up for your rights.
IDrA6gMxaa	Just ask him. Tell him that you are concerned and you would like to know the truth.    Also watch him closely (his behavior) for a few days and see if he changed.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	cheating and masterbation  don't normallly go in hand together    no  he not cheating|`|WlnnsGM5aa	Its hard to say, but I would keep a close eye on him, and see if you see anything else suspicious and if not let it go.|`|AA10327722	He was probably just masturbating in his boxers.  Guys do that.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	What you don't know about men is that boxers are a sperm dispencer for men as they are growing up, and they use it to shoot their load in all the time.|`|c01987f2cf9d98f28a9958d69b66ea7faa	It's only cheating if it's something he did that he could not share with you. It looks like you know he looks at internet porn, so, I'd say, if he is masterbating to porn, well, at least he is home. I would, however, keep an eye on how much he looks at porn. You might want to talk to him about boundries, and how much porn you can both agree on.|`|UsPexIj0aa	I'm going to guess no.  If he were cheating the evidence wouldn't be in the boxers.  Adults who cheat don't dry h**p.  Sounds like he was watching something x rated and got carried away.  Not a good thing, but not cheating.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	If thats all the "evidence" you have, and you cant find anything else thats suspicious at all.. then I'd say no, give him the benefit of the doubt.    He was probably..umm...satisfying himself!|`|xmmX3JTRaa	I would talk to him and ask. Ask him to be honest and do not get totally mad is he did something. Instead, try to find solutions to the problems that caused it.    Talk to your husband, tell him why you suspect him and and ask for honesty.|`|AA12113490	put a video camera hid somewhere & go to ur moms again and u will find out with motion dectors on the cam|`|a4330ad1bed7f5694c842222ebfdd2e6aa	I think you know the truth.  his reaction told you everything|`|u4pWVWonaa	Maybe those were the boxers he was wearing.  I think you might be freaking out a little bit! I hope I was helpful.|`|JHDTkct7aa	Amber,Amber,Amber,yes,he masturbated without you,you were cheated out of being able to watch.|`|9WoSt2Szaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  He probably beat his meat a little, then cleaned off with his boxers.  That's what I usually clean off with...has he cheated on you in the past, because if this is the only thing making you have these thoughts, then I'm sure your just being unrealistic about it all.    In my wednesday night church service, my pastor said that men are like waffles and women are like spaghetti, because men are simple and when they think about stuff, that's specifically their thought on it, and women are complex, because all of their thoughts enter-twine with one another and so one simple thing can lead to a huge deal in your mind.  For example, a bad look that your husband gives you, could ultimately make you think that he's having doubts about your relationship.    It should be fine, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  If anybody answers to this and tells you that he is cheating on you, just assume that they are just being ignorant and don't fret on it.      P.S.  If you have any questions, or it turns out that I was wrong, please feel free to talk to me about it.  My myspace url is myspace.com/kind_yet_strong and my email is austintalley69@yahoo.com|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	base on your above mentioned.  As of this point you don't have enough evidence for him to be a cheater.  It is hard to use what you saw against him as a cheater.  I is best to play low key until you catch him red handed.  Good luck and hope it is not what you think it is and that he didn't cheat.|`|vx4ESGN6aa	Has he done anything else suspicious? Usually there are everyday activities that suddenly start to change. I found out my husband was cheating on me after being alerted by an online quiz (http://www.pinow.com/resources/infidelit... I had been suspicious but wasn't sure if I was just being paranoid. I ended up hiring an investigator who was able to confirm my suspicious. Thank god I didn't go on living with all of those concerns.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Nothing in your question indicates that he is cheating.    He could have been wearing the boxers.    Your being paranoid.|`|K1UicE7kaa	I would believe him... it isn't always a totally planned event. Meaning you would have a towel or kleenex. You also wouldn't stop in the middle of it to get a towel (unless you have nerves of steel and major self discipline).  The boxers took the hit.     I messed up a tie by accident and my wife thought it was food and took it to the dry cleaners.  I unknowingly went to the dry cleaners... and the lady confronted me (with others waiting in line)  "What is this stain?"  I tried to get it out and it wouldn't come out!"  I was speechless and red-faced.  I am more careful now... he probably will be too.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	How the heck would we know?!|`|S3UxNOhdaa	Something isn't right with his story. You need to confront him with it. He doesn't sound truthful. Sorry.|`|0qAmRjfOaa	It more like he's nasty.
77ZVd5hyaa	I know I have and that's just the way it is.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	i would say we are both sacrifice equally, but as women point of view we do think that we did more than our men because we pay too much attention to the little things vs men seem to pay more attention to big things.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	no we do equal parts.and if the other needs help or a break they will step in for the other.|`|rQfzifT7aa	I feel we both make the same sacrifices in our marriage.   I may do for the kids more, but he keeps our vehicles in order, does alot of the grocery shopping, lots of the cooking. I do the dishes and do the laundry and pay all the bills.   We each pick a kids and help with homework. It is just stuff that has to be done and we don't put it off on the other one to do it.  If one can't take care of it the other one does. It is just how it works for us. We had a long talk about that before we got married.|`|rH33ty23aa	We are equal, there are times when i sacrifice and vice versa.|`|AA11483458	Oftentimes, women are always the ones to pull greater weight in the relationship as (some) men tend to feel that their efforts (though quantitatively less) are much greater because of the braun of the work. Men fail to understand that a woman who cooks, cleans, cares for the children, pursues an education, etc. is doing equally or considerably more than he credits himself for taking out the trash and working a typical 9-5.     If the responsibility imbalance bothers you, you should address it with your husband. Share your feelings of familial inequality and try to reach a compromise.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	we had to do the birth bit, so yes|`|0qAmRjfOaa	Women usually make more sacrifices. It's in out giving nature.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Sorry, but regardless of what you say before marriage, it's always the woman who sacrifices more.  Not that that is necessarily bad......|`|u4pWVWonaa	NO, I do not feel that way, I feel we both make great sacrifices for our kids and for each other!|`|obXAeNW5aa	we both do but that's the way it is and we are happy|`|lvelp0CGaa	I dont have to feel i have I KNOW I have .    I have worked since all my children were born , I spend more money monthly on the bills , the kids education / medical / clothing , putting food into the house , playing taxi service , being their councilor , their doctor , their tutor . I spend over 2600 a month keeping things the way it should be .I dont have money for me unless he pays a bill I dont have to pay .    He gets up goes to work comes home plays xbox360 or sits on line doing nothing pays the mortgage which is only 600 a month pays the rates 100 a month and then the rest of the money is his to do with as he please .    HELL YES I do more in every way shape and form .I am here for them physically , emotionally , financially , I worked and sacrificed so they could have things I didnt have growing up like christmas and birthday presents and I would do it all over again the same way if I had to because they're worth it and I love them .|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Most woman don't but they love to say they do.  Men work their tales off, its why they is most cases make more money.  Men sacrafice losing everything in a divorce, woman don't.
LenfoJSRaa	Maybe she had a real dose of life like a death in the family to make her realize she had to change her life.|`|LLILtn4Naa	she feels bad?|`|a0c95fc1a67ea521b01c5ac057a51aa2aa	doubt she lost all her friends, when people lose all their friends they go into hiding, not become nicer...|`|c2aNdjAdaa	She's probably lost a lot of friends and now wants to make friends with new people. Maybe you should forgive her, you could be great friends. But it's up to you.|`|l65lzB6paa	are you in the lime light? some people want to befriend you because u have been noticed by others for a special reason....watch out for her sounds a little shady.|`|BwoHmv6yaa	Very, very long period.|`|571e9820aeec6726992f197a18d8efb0aa	Maybe she finally got a BF?|`|vfH3dEkSaa	ask her.
28WJwHf4aa	Check Craigslist, or even eBay, to see if anyone is getting rid of some in your area.    I lucked out in that I found some available on eBay that were from a local seller. Since the shipping was extremely high, no one really bid on them. I got 9 clear glass cookie jars for $25. I ended up needing to buy 2 additional ones, one at $14.99 and the other at $11.99....so going the eBay route definitely saved me a considerable amount! I got clear acrylic tongs at the dollar store, 4 to a pack for $1.     We got all of our candy at Fleet Farm (when it was on sale) and Sam's Club.    Good luck! Our candy buffet was a complete hit!|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Go to a craft store like Michael's. They have tons of cheap containers made of glass that are supposed to be used for floral arrangements and candles but can easily be used for your purpose.|`|AA12113490	get u abunch of bowls that are pretty small to medium size go tthe the dollar store and buy up difffrent candies and have them setting out on a table my husband;s cousins did it and is was great everyone loved it then keep out little baggies so we could take some home to the kids really loved it spent a total of $50 on everything and she had over 150 people there
AA10862886	i'd be careful of where you go. try and find someone you know whos house you can go to but won't rat you out to your parents. you're going to be pretty cold if you plan on finding some place out on the streets or something|`|Ls6APGjgaa	Run away?  Is that what your going to do all your life?  Welcome to earth kid, you don't deserve legs.|`|igLsH24Qaa	You fool! If you need to ask strangers what to bring when you run away you will not survive. Be smart. Talk to your mom and tell he you need time away from the situation. Perhaps there is a friend or family with whom you can stay. Perhaps you could live with your father if that is an option. A girl in my town that was in a similar situation moved into our house for two years. She eventually reconciled with her mother but during that time she was safe and her mother knew where she was. She still had to share in the household chores and clean up after herself.   Be smart. If not you will break your heart and your mother's.  If none of this works for you make sure you walk out the door with at least $5000. That should last you a few months. That's reality kid.|`|utwCJWhQaa	Go to your best friends house while you think it over. Plan it from there if you must.|`|AA11280073	Sure, go right ahead. I hope you like eating out of garbage cans and fighting off rapists and people who want to turn you into a prostitute. The problems you have now will look like a picnic compared to what will happen to you on the street.|`|I8iFm8Qkaa	hmmm, something to protect yourself. Lot's of crazies out there that like immature teenagers...  you should probably get a job.  u know, to be able to get money.   oh clothes,  soap,  don't wanna be stinkin.  food..  blankets  toothbrush  makeup  u know, things that you'd need to survive

Good luck.|`|znxFD103aa	You can not blame her for the way her family is, but if it is making problems in your relationship you need to talk about it. If she does not know how to love, then how can you expect her to be good at it without some loving guidance. Just surround her with love and understanding, and she will see what a wonderful man you are, and begin to realize how a person treats another when they truly love them. You be her role model:)|`|a26UpHq1aa	Yes, you can, here is why I know.. My family is absolutely CRAZY they are all un happy and it's their way or no way, and will never agree for me too be with the man I LOVE.

rRgS4ss9aa	probably because dating is usually with another aquaintance, and so getting used and accustomed to the others' personally is ambiguous. So technically, you wouldn't know the actual person. (this is similar to having sexual intercourse or dancing with a random person, they show you the side you like without actually knowing them as a person) Date rape is probably one of the top ways to die because it involves only two secluded people, and with that opportunity, it is very possible for dates to get raped and killed.|`|vdPTAxmDaa	i'll show you|`|N8XIRucgaa	no. death does.|`|ZyvJEA1Naa	14|`|AA11758925	its a knockout drug called date rape drug, many will not wake up, but the ones who do cant remember what happened to em while they where knocked out
AA10065812	*** Just call any women's shelter.  They will show you how to file a restraining order, and your allegations don't even need to be true.  You can even inflate them all you want, as you are not required to prove anything.    From there they will show you how to destroy your marriage, rather than find a way to get him help, and how to destroy any relationship he has with his child.      You can even accuse him of sexual abuse of the child, to make sure he can never come around.  In some states, you will even be rewarded for it by receiving additional financial aid, which he will be ordered to pay for.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	I've been there. It can take time, but you need to work on it now. Apply for federally assisted housing.  Come up with alternate job strategies-like being a live in for an elderly person.  Once on your own, you can get food stamps, medical, and tuition assistance.  Ask your women's shelter if they offer free counseling-they usually do, and can help you work out plans for safety, emergency escape, and long term escape.  You don't have to go this alone, and there are more people out there than you realize that will help.  Some churches offer aid-have you tried that? Let me know how it works out.|`|E7TkNO00aa	The first thing you need to do is get out. First, because it's unhealthy for your daughter to be living like that even though she is too young to understand right now. If your parents or friends can't help you, go to a church. I'm sure a priest can help you and help you find a shelter. Don't look back, look forward. Do it for your daughter and for yourself. Then you can find a job and with God's help, the rest will come to you. I wish you the best of luck. Leave before it can be too late.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	I've given this advice to many women. And it worked for me. So here goes again. Get a job, very important. Start a savings acct. using a friends address. And put as much money as possible in it everyday,1.00, 5.00, 10.00 or once a week. Until you have enough to move on. Then go a rent a storage building and start slowly moving stuff out, that you and your daughter will need to start off. Clothes, pot and pans, you know the little stuff that he will not notice. Continue to build that savings. Start looking for rental away from where you are at. Then when everything is in place, get out fast. Be prepared for him to try and bother you on the job. Hopefully, you will have a good boss that will back you up and send him on his way.|`|7cjqT33Baa	This has to be some kind of writing assignment?  Who talks that way? Unfetter, Of current, purvey.  You definitely have a way with words.  I would take work as a live-in nanny or caretaker to escape that situation.  Whatever it took, I wouldn't raise my kid in that situation.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  Just do what it takes to get out.|`|rQfzifT7aa	You seem very educated.    For starters you have to be ready to say "okay this is enough".  After that you can either plan your departure.    My first advice is to file for a protection from abuse order from the circuit clerks office usually in the courthouse. Just fill out a form and take it to a judge to sign in. In most states it is free.  You can even have him removed from the home and he will be jailed if he returns.        That usually gets you free unless you are afraid that even after the order he will still harm you.   If that is the case, a shelter may be a better option.   You stated there is a waiting list. Contact you local law enforcement and let them know you are being abused and that you are afraid for your life (those are your key words) and need a shelter.   Someone should help you get into a shelter    I hope this helps you. If not email me. I help battered women every day. If you are willing to get out of an abusive situation. I am willing to do anything in my power to help you.|`|YBGg7JCGaa	GET A BACKBONE!!!  1. find the door  2. walk out  if you can't call the police, find a shelter, a friend, a family  3. get a job and work on your education.  4. good luck

kZ5Bu7L0aa	Maybe you're just nervous or too aggressive so you just start biting his lips. Well making out gets better with more practice. Just take it slowly for now and be relaxed!! keep your mouth opened and avoid closing it too much or you might end up biting him! a little playful bite is ok but not chomping!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	I'm a bit confused, why don't you just not bite his lip? Biting is a controllable action. Use your lips, not your teeth.|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	i'm a biter too lol. apparently guys think it's hot when you bite them. not too hard though hahah:)|`|jPoQm3C1aa	Why don't you just try not to use your teeth?    I don't know how he's taking it, since I'm not your boyfriend.|`|AA11758925	practice as much as possible.|`|KVAh5xxSaa	Aw, I hope he brought it up in a happy way. Anyway, just remember not to use your teeth next time. Since he didn't stop while you were biting him, he probably enjoyed it anyway. Next time, just ask him to tap you if you're biting, you should be okay!    Have fun =)|`|769673b54b5f0954c7e21c7fe2878c65aa	haha my bf said he same thing when we started makingout. and i felt bad cuz like you i thought he was joking but he said it a few times, but i didnt see any bite marks, but then i was just careful and tried to pay more attention to where i put my lips lol. just casually ask him one day after making out, so hows your lip, am i still biting it? ask in a joking way so it will be less embarassing. and your most likely not a bad kisser or else he still wouldnt be kissing you.|`|1zr6IH2Yaa	Haha this exact thing happened to me and my girlfriend. She would do that to me too. But I mentioned it to her and she hasn't done it since. And no this does not make you a bad kisser, just try using more lips and less teeth ;) lol|`|2mdGosgCaa	Only bite if the moment is THAT intense. Otherwise, it's kinda like your attacking him. If you find that you just can't stop - learn how to nibble. Guys love the nibble. Just chill out and take it easy when you start kissing. Let the moment get intense enough so you CAN bite. But only if the moment goes there. Don't rush things - rushing gets you into trouble.|`|c5dMENfMaa	I hear you, except it's quite different in my situation because both my boyfriend and I like a little pain when we fool around. Biting sometimes is just a little more erotic than some are accustom to. If you are into biting when you make out then make sure you execute it in a sensual way.   Try instead of just biting him, catch his bottom lip with your teeth, while applying only a very slight amount of pressure, and suck on his bottom lip for maybe one or two seconds. Then resume kissing quicky or slowly depending on the effect you are trying to create for him. Or instead of going straight back to the kissing try trailing little butterfly kisses from him mouth and down to his neck, scraping your teeth a little across his skin once you're past his jawline. Then maybe again incorporate your biting here and nip his neck only slightly or if your up for the chalenge try giving him a baby hickey. But make sure you don't rush into it or otherwise you'll come off as Dracula.  Men are much more turned on by feather light touches than women, and that occasional bite won't hurt a bit if he's really wrapped up in how your touching him, he'll be to distracted to register the pain. But watch out because this kind of kissing from you will put you in extreme control of the kiss and will really catch his attention. For a new relationship this maybe to much and might lead to things that you two aren't ready for. But biting isn't always bad if done right.
1OEDcz6Raa	you cant bring back someone who is already gone. if she doesnt want to be around her, then screw her. find some new friends. sorry but its the only thing you can do|`|XsVHrccCaa	ughh i feel the same way my friends hav been making me like im invisible lately  i think u should just tell your best friend that u feel upset nd y u think she wants to hang out with "cooler" ppl|`|sknSVTGnaa	ignore them i guess. Just hang out with other people who want to be good friends to you|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	um...yeah oookey        just find smone to have fun with       be yar self n be kowl      yay im awsome n i rock      peaceout homies 8D|`|YvAdssn6aa	Whatever you do.... do NOT blame yourself!    She may be going through something right now... or have some issues that she may think you wont understand...     Maybe ask her what is going on... but not in a confrontational way.|`|cgmKYbpZaa	well your friend has moved on u probly didnt hav much in common any more etc...if u hav other friends just hangout with one of ur other friends...its hard to relise that shes/he moved on just like that but **** happens it will feel weird for a while but u will get over it...its happened to alot of people so ur ot the only one dont worry...and if she was really ur best friend she would of helped try to make ur friendship not screw up so yea.|`|OUDXDNBLaa	Your friend has moved on, you can't make someone like you.  Find yourself another friend,|`|5859acd6abba0dc39cae589a6e1c48b2aa	make new friends and let her go her own way.. i had to do that with one of my old best friends and honestly my life is so much happier now.|`|d8bdfs7faa	my suggestion is if she wants to be like that with you then go find a new friend that you can hang out with. i mean i know its upsetting but **** that **** she wants to be like that to you then show her you can get a better friend !
znxFD103aa	yes! This is possible it happens all the time. My boyfriend that I am with now said that he knew we were going to be together from the moment he seen me. He told all of his friends, and even some of mine, before I even knew. The funny thing is, I was very attracted to him too, but am not the type to persue a man. (I let them do the introducing) Anyway, my point is, people have feelings all the time that come true about love. Good LucK|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I don't think it's possible to always know when you meet "the one."  You obviously feel a great deal of emotional and oerhaps physical chemistry.  That's wonderful!  Enjoy that.  If it continues to develop in a positive direction, fantastic!  It sounds like the way you are feeling is very different than in the past, and just maybe this is a more mature attraction than you have experienced before.  Time will tell, but there is no way to know this early in the game.  Remember also that you don't really know him yet and that having that "one day we'll be together" relationship will also require that his feelings are similar to yours.  Best wishes!|`|63a16c4605f24bcea912a3db99b38642aa	Nope. It's not possible. Better luck next time.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	i dont think its deeper i think it just is love at first sight|`|xmmX3JTRaa	I think it might be still to early. Take some time, know him better, and then you will know if he is the "one" for you.|`|2v8FSsiaaa	NOOOO don't fall for that!!!! IT is obviously way to early for you to be thinking that way! You are going to put yourself in a really bad situation if you make decisions based on your emotions....Thats all lust right now! Make sure that you have been with a guy for more than 2 years before you decide on marriage...I think thats really important that you know the person inside out...even after a few years, people change!!!!! Thats what you need to keep in mind! I hope you take this advice and run with it!|`|IDrA6gMxaa	It can happen. But to makes sure he is the one you need to meet him, spend some time together and you will see if you really "fit". Remember that he also have to feel the same.    Good Luck,|`|jAGwyyuyaa	Yes, it's possible. But the trick is to get him to see how much you have in common. And hopefully, he will feel the same about you. So you need to make the connection and get the ball rolling. Have fun and good luck|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	No. I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. Even if you end up marrying this guy, it will not be because you "knew" when you met him. It will be because you two connected and worked really hard to make it happen. Just being fascinated and having stuff in common isn't enough.     That does not mean you won't end up with this guy! But you will have to make it happen!     Good luck!|`|0qAmRjfOaa	Sounds like you lust after him and really are attracted to him. Give it time and you will find out if your feelings are true.
0bjQfb01aa	You need to distance yourself from her because she is becoming a toxic friend. Try to hang out with your other friends and become "busy" when she calls. If not, then you'll just have to start standing up to her when she says something or she'll keep on doing it. If this doesn't work, pull her aside and tell her that you're there if she needs you because you're concerned about her.|`|AA11280073	She is not your friend. For some reason, she resents you. It could be jealousy. I would drop her like a bad habit.|`|AA10010935	It's better to not have any friends than to have so called friends who treat you like crap.    Who knows what's going on with her, but don't let her drama become your drama.   She sounds pretty insecure with herself, but that's her problem.   She says her life is the worst, but that doesn't give her the right to take it out on others.   If you think she is worth having as a friend, talk to her and see if she will open up. Otherwise, let her go until she smartens up.
Up2Plb2zaa	well my brother dumped a girl, but i thought this girl was really nice! so i asked him why the hell he did it and he said that he's not into her anymore becoz there are too many awkward quiet moments. also he said she was immature. so he i guess they are some things.|`|lOR8QDBpaa	stupidity  acting like idiots or trying to act cool  .|`|ulsIrphnaa	bitchyness rude ungreatful snobby bitterness  just be nice sweet flirty and yeah stay cute  idunno haha|`|GChKzEilaa	they get mad over everything|`|JyrvQBVgaa	they overreact about every little thing.. clinginess...|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	i would think if she stresses out about every little thing then that's a turn off.|`|LbtU8iWAaa	when they act like b****es and make up dumb, un-true rumors about there best friends!!!!!!|`|w9mE5b7Jaa	Over sexual when first meeting!|`|RVceBujtaa	dis what you wrote?

vffZ3is4aa	go to the sporting goods dept at walmart and buy some earplugs. when you hear them put the earplugs in. or put your mp3 player on with some sound deadening earphones.    If you can figure out ahead of time what day they are going to do it you could sleep on the couch, invite your bff over so she can comfort you for having such rude parents, or spend the night at your bff's house.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Get some ear plugs or turn your stereo or tv up loud when you hear them.|`|oxmkllnWaa	either turn up the radio, tv, ipod, whatever to help ignore them...     or listen to them if it turns you on.    in any case you are NOT the product of virgin birth!     get over it. They're adults and they're married.|`|AA10953999	Blast the T.V the Stereo and anything else you can find that makes noise. Is there anyway you can move to another room?  If they are having sex at night when you should be in bed asleep then maybe you should think about going to bed earlier so you do not hear them. If it happens when they know you are home during the day then you have some inconsiderate parents there.|`|7xNlABgSaa	Leave the house. They can stop to ask where you're going, or you can wait until they're around people you all know and bring it up to embarrass them like I would do in your situation - but they pay the bills in the house. So adapt or get used to it.|`|0KmJwYunaa	You could threaten to join them, that should weird them out.   Of course, they may call your bluff...|`|X7fJjXFuaa	turn up your stereo or tv or leave the room to go somewhere else.|`|Hdyc9VR4aa	haha omg... i used to live right under my moms room and i'd hear the same thing. there is nothing you can do. it's not like they are going to stop having sex because you can hear it. And it's not like they are going to be super quite and hold everything in while doing it. (what fun would that be?).    Anyway what i used to do was... if i were sleeping (or trying to) I'd put pillows over my head, or put my stereo on or put my headphones in my ears.     If it's not very late... go for a walk maybe.|`|oqgWG3rJaa	RUN! lol yea honestly listen to a cd or watch some tv or something. been there done that...there EWWW|`|AA10387392	ear plugs from the drug store works best!
AA10953999	oh man that sucks. I hate how mean some high schoolers can be. I guess the only thing you can do is act as if nothing happened. Sit on the other side of the room from them. If you see them in the hall just flip them off. They'll get the hint and eventually leave you alone. Sorry you have to go through something so immature.|`|sdRKeujpaa	Come to my site =] It's connected to my personal blog. I am a 21 year old girl who loves to help people out.

3pTr2ZZOaa	If he's responsible i see nothing wrong with that...   If you dont let him go he'll start to think that you dont trust him to make the right decisions. Then he'll start making the wrong ones to rebell against you. :(|`|aMgmTN3zaa	I guess it depends.. If you have your parents permission, then it's probably fine!!|`|961PBKmAaa	Apparently your parents think so.  Now go tell them that some random dude on the internet thinks it's OK and see what they say.  Do you expect this to change anything?|`|OqAOCBnFaa	Very responsible especially the picked up by parents. Just as long as you are responsible at the rock show.|`|0dEG6Y4daa	You have to base your decision on a little bit of trust. If you kid seems responsible and its until 11, i'm sure that will be ok. If something goes wrong your responsible kid will call!|`|EkdRA0qbaa	as long as you are responsible, its not a band known for getting violent or having problems at the shows and your parents know your friends and have contact info for their parents, you are being dropped off and picked up, should be fine.|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	If nothing bad happened, then it's okay. But the age is too young, you should know better.|`|Zzumj5HDaa	I would follow my gut instinct. If this is a show where there will be a large amount of adults attending, I would say no. You wouldn't want her/him getting into a grown up or dangerous situation. If it's a teen club with security or police in place it should be fine. Just make sure they carry a cell phone with them, and you pick them up promptly after the show.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	I agree with Red Drum, especially if parents are picking you up right after.|`|ErcsrWtJaa	No. I would not let my daughter do it. Not because she was irresponsible but because other people can be.|`|1hcupwT4aa	No I don't think so.  At 15 years old, staying out with friends til 11 isn't that bad at all.  Especially if they're responsible.    Sounds like good old fun to me...
U0Z9mU49aa	can you be some more specific about your question??
FdGBJdU9aa	In Kentucky I think any age including 1st cousins.|`|56XwyVW9aa	You can date and hold hands with anybody! However the catch is sexual acts. The legal age for consent in Kentucky is 16! I did check some ome you laws and if someone has intercourse with someone under 14 and they are 18, then it is second degree, you know what!    I will provide you with a legal website or 2 below.    An easier way is to call a lawyer and ask or to actually call a police department and tell them that you and a girlfriend were curious about the law and were having a debate!    I have actually done that in the past!|`|CpfJxUfBaa	The maximum age you can date? Anything under the age of deceased, even if you try its just going to be an unrequited love.|`|W4l19Y8Faa	help-n-ator, I've had good success with online dating.

JwW4UOPFaa	no not good idea  specially that you say you don't like her ideas|`|lpRvjp1Xaa	If you are already having problems and can't resolve them don't do it.  OR you need to agree to do different shows.  At that you can give clients options, you both present options and let them decide.  But at that you will have to decide on what cut each will get from the other unless you are planning on doing salaries.  But then you could run into who gets the most jobs and who makes more for the company.  So, in the long run, not a good idea.|`|UhrvW6eYaa	Nah you need another person to verify and challenge your ideas. Otherwise your business or choices won't be balanced.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the hardest things to do can be to tell some guy that you like him. Why?    The bottom line is, it's the fear of rejection - we ask people other questions all the days of our lives.    Therefore in order to ask the question, you have to study what's the worst that could happen. And that is the answer "no".    But there is nothing really to fear in the word no - it just means that he doesn't value you (his loss) or just doesn't think you are compatible (best to find out now) or he is seeing someone else (fair enough).    Hope this helps~|`|952941d46cfeb5d0a0dae0acee876373aa	ask him to go out then tell him|`|7ab7fcd97fb0c7216e50e469576d9ca0aa	you have to be the one to tell him.  Test the waters to see if he is single, and then tell him that you like him and were wondering if he would like to grab a bite to eat or something.
fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	I've always heard that but I've never heard of a sturdy to know if that is true.  I don't think everyone is getting what you mean.  A deep question, right?|`|5vOV8XVhaa	psh yea! Like rly, hands are fine, Feet are a little awkward but not bad, and if a guy doesn't like you cuz your hands, omg hes not worth your time...|`|Ve48V97Baa	hell yes, that means she has potential for guitar hero..and thats whats up!|`|AA12020487	F U C K YA|`|At3epWQwaa	I have long fingers and I'm a girl. I had my palms read by a psychic and he asked if I was a piano player because I had long skinny fingers. And I'm not a piano player... it was kinda funny since he's supposed to be psychic. LOL
AA11903993	Don't do it, your life will go nowhere.|`|AA11322853	i know school isn't for everyone. i quit school, and i worked for several years. by now, i'm ready to go back to school. that's just me though. if you do decide to quit school now, remember you can go back later if you choose. i got a ged and went to college.|`|AA11924061	sweetie i can tell by your question you need school " I'm want to drop out...." it's "I want to drop out..." At least you capatilized it. Baby do yourself a favor stay in school. please!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10716277	That will be the biggest mistake you could make. I dropped out of school and have regretted it all of my adult life.|`|91cd8004fa4e3853115853e1465131b9aa	I know school blows, but in my opinion, finsih.  I've been in a lot of places that I never thought that I would be.  And the one thing that was the constant.  No education, you get squat.      People have a high school diploma, not the GED, get better job with higher pay.      My Mother is always going back to school; she has 3 masters degrees.  And she is paid a mid 6 figure salary.  She is in school now, at the age of 69, working on her 4 masters.|`|AA10001067	I hated school too....  So I chose to take agriculture classes and I work for a Vet Animal hospital before and after school and I got credit for working...    change schools if you must....but don't drop out otherwise you will only need two things to remember "Do you want paper or plastic" OR "Do you want frys with your order".|`|cd1015e661981dc4565313b8c392acf9aa	The worst thing you could do is drop out of school.  The chances of you having a worthwile job and life quickly diminish without that diploma.  Try to stick it out.  If you think high school sucks, just wait until you have to work full-time for a living.|`|a1a4b9c851bdd72a94c186bc2f550f6baa	hmm  I was  kicked  out  my 8th grade year and  never went back ..I deeply regret it .. you should stay  in school  I dunno how  old you are but  maybe  u  should get  part time job after  school  or something .. school  is a big  part  of your  life and  u need it ..I  am  dependant  on a  man  and  its rediculous ..its almost impossible  to find a job without a high school  education ..your young be a kid and enjoy  it ..  being  out  on your own  aint all  it  seems  to be .. I PROMISE!!!  its  very stressful  dont try to  grow up so  fast enjoy your childhood I never got  one . you will  regret  it  later  if you drop  out ..everyone  I know  regrets  it!!!
waj2cHCpaa	Yes. It shows a lack of self respect.|`|igkbUflbaa	A little, I think it shows a lack of intellectual sophistication. At the same time, prudish, I don't like either. I guess I'm just hard to please!|`|gUWcvxzuaa	Depends on how and where it's done etc|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Yes I do.|`|010e19f149ca4d52d45d1e56e06050e1aa	Depends on how 'revealing' the outfit is. In general, girls dress a little too revealing in my opinion, but sometimes a girl can pull off an outfit without looking too trashy, while another can't. I'm afraid it's simply too hard to be specific in this case.|`|AA11625194	If the girl isn't good looking at all and has a bunch of makeup to go with the revealing/skimpy clothing then, yes its very trashy and unattractive.    but on the other hand if its someone you like or have an attraction for, then its probably going to be a turn on.
oQq1rqDVaa	I wouldn't make a big deal out of this.  This girl was on your mind before you fell asleep and that is why you had a dream about her.  Used to happen to me once in a while as well (well with guys I know) and I used to feel really embarrassed when I bumped into them again - although very enjoyable in my dreams!!|`|J9OrYB2Laa	I've had dreams where I want so badly for them to have a meaning to it....really, it's just wishful thinking possibly.    But in the end, it's just a dream and you were probably just thinking about her a lot after she left.|`|6nYZAkVRaa	the Devil is getting in your way. if you have feelings for one girl....don't mess it up. Dreams most of the time don't mean they will come true. and i hope it dose not man!!!|`|9pNl1tkiaa	It means you want to visit her garden and grab her huge olives.|`|pbPe614Raa	i wouldnt really believe that its a sign of anything.  a lot of the time when you think hard about something throughout the day,it will appear in your dreams the way you want it to happen.so...maybe you still have feelings for this girl and felt a sexual feeling of her that day.|`|W6uHaI1kaa	Maybe you still like her deep down and she will ask you to do something with her and you just cant resist. and maybe your friend will find out and not know how to react.|`|QgCqvtTQaa	random!|`|gRsuXxkbaa	u lack closure with the old friend  - whatever unresolved issues u have need resolve|`|S8TarSM8aa	Don't make the mistake of identifying with your thoughts, much less your  dreams... Be still for a moment, try to listen to the voice in your brain thus eliminating it, and if your inner core draws you to the near girl, make the wish and let yourself be lead toward her. If your inner core says nothing however, breathe in and move forward. Hope this helps!|`|QFrPpfr0aa	It's random.  Just a dream :)  Sometimes we think about the things we did or the people we recently hung out with. And our minds just wonder off, you know?    :) No worries, if you still love your girlfriend then your good haha.    xx|`|bxUjRKWLaa	i think the dream was just bringing back the old you?  byr the sound of it is just a one of . but i dont know what you feel?    youll have to try figure it out?    i hope i helped a little.    xx  good luck|`|MxN8gIpLaa	maybe its your mind playing tricks on you|`|7sxGW40qaa	When you dream it's your brain just sorting out the facts and stuff that happened to you during the day.  It's probably just your brain recalling what you felt for her.  It's nothing.|`|Y9l0jDlcaa	because you still  have feelings for her.|`|56XwyVW9aa	That sums it up then! If you love your girlfriend then it was just a cool fantasy that you choose not to act on! IT IS NORMAL!|`|toQ3ZSKTaa	Just a random dream brother, not to worry about. You just said it, you love your girlfriend, and its all that matters.|`|AA10456687	This has happened to me before. For me it did kind of mean something, because it turns out the my friend that I dreamed about, actually had feelings for me. And so did I but nothing ever happened between us because I wanted to stay with my gf.    My point is you may have some feelings for your friend, and she probably has feeling for you too. I can't really say, but I'm just guessing.|`|a9OwtN7faa	it is a dream that you mind has conjured to remind you of the feelings you've kept for this girl.  I say *** it just see tell her and see where it leads you, that is only if you and your gf are not that serious. If you are then wait and see were you are in a couple of months. If it's still in your mind it is because there might be something.   But remember don't hurt you GF for a fling! make sure it is something worth doing, really analyze if you want to spend  your life with you GF. If so then just forget it, you will save yourself a lot of time and trouble.   -oh and you will not turn into a DOG!|`|H6tfjz8Saa	your madly in love with that girl, you wish that weren't a  dream,, clearly if it was so vivid yet you didn't wake up during the middle of it|`|iB27Flhvaa	I think subconsciously you were wondering what it would have been like if you had done something about it  It's a good thing though- now it's out of your system and you can be happy with your girlfriend!! :)|`|WjMalAU5aa	you must have been thinking about her that night before you went to sleep|`|z7jH5N5oaa	it means your not gay
0aa322822400229efff0a4c7322987dcaa	yea you cant think somone is hot without liking them go for it or tell him no|`|AA11570347	That's a nice compliment and just take it as that.  You're exes for a REASON, right?|`|b6c7b652560a1d9fc2431bbaa0c00918aa	I don't know.  My ex did the same to me 2 days after breaking up.  He complimented me even more that day than when we dated!|`|AA10937008	well i think that the waitress in the nearest star bucks is HOTT but i still do not like her      hope u got ur ans|`|AA11642773	yes

f8937b259f4107afe03f24f083714e47aa	My guess is that porn actors must probably have regular screening for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) and HIV/AIDS so that they can have unprotected sex in porn movies.|`|AA11939205	man, you need a life!|`|AA12083830	If its an old movie then it was before AIDS/HIV was running rampant in the industry. If its a new one then modern technology can edit it out or hide it very well.

gUWcvxzuaa	Of course they do. They learn from their mistakes  ;)|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	I didn't change, but when I met my wife, of 25 years, I didn't have any reason to cheat. She's fun, she's my best buddy, she's never had a headache, never said no, never even admitted that she wasn't in the mood. If she was neglected for very long, she grumbled that she was horny. In addition to all this, she did it without being demanding. Kinda miss all the action I got while married to first wife, but I don't have time now.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	only when they get too old to. most do not change.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Some do.

If they were cheating cause they were missing something at home, then yes it is possible|`|xmmX3JTRaa	They do sometimes. If your husband cheated talk to him and find the reasons. Sometimes what caused cheating can be fixed and you still can be a happy couple.    Talk to your husband first to see what can be done to prevent it from happening again.|`|AA11678629	NO|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	not usually. don't get involved with a cheater. don't waste your time or energy|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	NO.  it is a challenge for them and that will never change.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	Not really. I think if they get away with it once, they'll do it again until caught. And that goes for women, too.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	Sometimes they do, sometimes they do not.    Try to find out why your husband cheated. Maybe it was partially your fault?    Talk to him and try to find out. Only then you will know if there is a chance for him to change.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Very, very rarely, but it can happen.

But if you're 14 years old, you must be living with some guardians of some kind and the government would not be asking you to pay them anything. I think some more counseling would be the best thing for you.

AA11114970	Personally I prefer Shane or Mark.  If you are looking for baby names, please stay away from Angus.  Your child will be made fun of to no end if you give him that name.  All of the other names I think are great but Shane and Mark are my personal favorites.    Maybe the meanings of the names would help you:    Mark: Warlike, hammer, defender  Luke: Bringer of light  Shane: God is gracious  Dave: Hebrew for the name David meaning beloved one  Angus: Superb, unique    I hope this helped!|`|AA11781916	Shane|`|AA10743825	shane all the way|`|1a1cbb684041759e9eab5c108e5ee86baa	Shane or Luke.|`|ffbf8f89ab5858e82e6610f88e25c74aaa	i like Sean...but the best one there is shane i guess...|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	I like Luke!

AA11649471	Why would someone lie about this?  If its to get intimate..then I would question whether it was love or lust.  If you have already been intimate with them... then it may be the truth.  Love in my opinion has different steps.  Meaning you can love someone as a friend, as a lover, as a person and as a lifetime partner.  I love many people in my life although not all the same.  I guess to answer your question.. if they told you they love you.. just be happy about it.  Dont worry so much if its a lie.. because it really doesnt matter if they are lying or not.  We all want to be loved and just be thankful that another person loves you. It may last a week, two years or a lifetime. Fact is. they told you that they loved you and take it at face value.  Good Luck!|`|c8d736b9d841fb05f0429dfb18f6263caa	if he love ask him to marry u then the answer he gives will help u to know the truth|`|AA10962547	just really closely listen to the way he says it n look deeply into his eyes when hes telling u! if he seems uneasy hes most likely lying to u to get wat he wants|`|AA11918039	you know it when they are just kiddin, they really mean it when they repeat it . as for most men, if they say it they mean it.

bc090ac338e79fef2a43cc835b35069faa	i believe that everybody in this world talk about people behind their back.I think u should go and talk to them(Ur friends) openly about this issue. as Ur family want u to include Ur friends and they want u to share Ur problem with them,then even u should tell Ur parents about Ur friends talking behind ur back and you can make them understand one cant talk to those who back stab you.as you dont make friends easily this doesnt mean that you should talk with those also back stab about.now rest depends on you.|`|40bda46ca4a62c59d7f4ac0558c9debaaa	ALL U CAN DO IS ASK THEM WHATS THE PROBLEM.

STAY SWEET|`|AA11545874	If they are back stabbing you try not to be so close to them and just be in a causal way since it wont be proper to break up.

7c992c576c01e422b19e87c9d97985dfaa	Oi "meiga",    Eu tambm sou mezzo-soprano!  Adoro cantar, mas n?o sou compositora.  Considero que tenho uma vz boa, s que tem mdia intensidade e tenho dificuldade em gravar a letra das msicas.  Participei 5 anos de um coral da universidade em que me formei.  Sou amadora.  Tambm gosto muito de ouvir msica clssica orquestrada e peras.    Sinto pena das pessoas que acham que msicas deste tipo s?o s para pessoas "esclarescidas".  Todo ser humano tem sentimento e para se entender o clssico  s fechar os olhos e escutar.  Duvido quem n?o se emocione ao ouvir algo desse gnero.    Quem gosta de cantar e tem somente uma vz afinada, mas n?o  especial,  difcil cantar solo.  J em conjunto com outras vozes  mais fcil.  Cantar em grupo, com vozes divididas entre soprano, contralto, tenor e baixo  uma das coisas mais maravilhosas que aconteceu comigo. Tenho muita saudade daqueles tempos.  Infelismente  baixa a remunera??o de um profissional do canto, sem ser de carreira solo.   Hoje, tenho uma profiss?o muito diferente do canto, tenho esposo e filhos, n?o estou podendo encaixar o canto na minha vida, mas no futuro...    Aquele que nunca participou de um grupo de canto n?o tem a no??o do que est perdendo.    Grande abra?o!|`|374d172f6c85b184189e5c3439126b17aa	N?o canto n?o.|`|e76f5b558574b45657f64f972f50664eaa	eu canto,eu sou mezzo  eu nao nao entendo muito so sei cantar em casa mais ja fiz alguns chous com meu pai eu nao sei se sou boa !

8e7d74d9cdafc78cbb086277fe7c85bbaa	Wow, tough one. The reason you're struggling is because there simply is not a nice way to say "I love you, but...."    However, not being honest with him will do neither of you any favors. Provided you feel safe,  I suggest you open up and tell him exactly what's on your mind. Honesty may not always be what we want to hear but it's always the respectful and right thing. I would ask him to please understand how hard this is for you and that you care enough about him to be honest with him. I would tell him you respect him and feel he has the right to know your true feelings instead of you trying to be someone fake. And I would tell him none of us know what the future holds but at this point you do not feel like dating him anymore and felt he would want to know this.     Of course if he has feelings for you then it's going to hurt his feelings. Only a machine would not be bothered. However, no matter how sad or mad he may get, he has to respect you. Just as importantly, you will respect yourself for being honest and treating others the way you want to be treated. What's right is right and when it's all over you can be confident that you did what was right, not necessarily what was easiest. It will certainly be the proper way to end it.    Stay hopeful!    James|`|adab08c3ffa31e2f450b3ddf3ccfb5c7aa	Hey the love we had is gone we can still be friends but it is best if we move on and start seeing other people|`|AA11939205	that works...or you can go at it hot and heavy, then get up and tell him this, "that better last you a lifetime, because thats all your getting from me!", that should do the trick also.

790bac75f36724095c24fb91c7a1d641aa	Going out of your way to see her does show you care about her. However, if you live several hours away from her, going every weekend can really be exhausting. It doesn't mean you don't love her if you say once in a while that you can't make the trip. You won't much fun to be with if you are completely burned out. If she really cares about you, she will not expect you to come every weekend on a long trip. Like someone said, you may be able to alternate who visits who sometimes and take a weekend off here and there. However, as the guy, you SHOULD go see her more than she comes to you. It's the chivalrous thing to do.|`|AA11805725	I think it does mean alot... You are a good guy for doing it. But maybe you guys can alternate so that it doesnt become too much for you|`|6ff2cfaf0df0ace2e6032ac16e45c202aa	My boyfriend and i did the long distance thing for awhile and yes it meant alot that he came down every week to see me but I went every week to see him as well. It goes both ways.
AA12083470	How is her memory with other things?  If she can remember everything else, chances are she can remember that.  What does the doctor say about her memory?  If she didn't know where your relationship standed then she shouldn't have did it  until she found out if she was in a serious relationship with someone else.  The statement "What you don't know won't hurt you" is very odd.  That makes me think she was trying to get away with it.  If you really want to be with her, keep your guard up and look for more suspicious things.  Chances are, she will do it again and that will tell you everything you need to know.  If you can't handle what she did to you, then move on.  You will find someone else better and you deserve better.  Good luck.|`|AA11668115	The injury was an excuse. An excuse can oly be use so any times b4 it is not believed. I think I would remeber cheating on my BF even with brain damage. It's not something you'd forget. You did the right thing to break up with her.   Cheating is bad enough but pretending you don't even know when you  truly know you've been caught.

51abef0a16469c6ec5b4a225ef86dfb7aa	I hear ya sis! Time to throw my pennies in. I know exactly where you are coming from. I was in love with a girl sometime ago and she did broke up wth me. A few weeks later she told me why (she was seeing someone else) I practically begged her to finish and come back but she decided to be stupid and live where the 'grass is greener!' However then she woke up and wanted me back    No just like you, i loved this person sooo much but i was hurting way tooo bad. But everyone deserves a second chance i agree. We gave it another shot but believe me i couldnt move on from the pain, I couldnt forget and it made things difficult not to mention how she treated me but thats a different story.    The fact of the matter is we split-up again, got back again but it wasnt working. For us it was the cliche:'once its broken it wont be the same again' We were doomed! The last time I walked away (for the first time ever) and i got my closure and now i can love another! Food for thought?    As for you, you have to decide what you want. You have probably already realised that as you have gone through that hurt and got your life back together your ex wants you back (its always the case) So you either:  1)Give him that second chance on your terms    2)tell him he blew his once and only chance    Its upto you! But trust me, if you are still hurting dont bother, you'll never be able to hack it!     Anyway think about your current boyfriend. Is it fair that your ex is trying to split you two up now? No!! Tell him he has to wait his turn (he will if he truly loves you (its his fault he aint there with you now right?) Truly understand what you like about your current etc (but dont compare) and maybe you'll get the answer what to do!    Good luck in your decision BUT ULTIMATELY IT AINT POSSIBLE OR FAIR TO BE INVOLVED WITH TWO AT ONCE    P.s. A friend of mine was married and went through a break, he gets his life back she wanted him back and now they have two beautiful children and they are stronger than ever. More food for thought??    SOMETIME IT WORKS SOMETIMES IT DONT|`|f1221ac740b949abe98fbe47c529aca0aa	tell him,oh well....you  had your  chance!!...and don,t look back!!!!|`|AA10450159	It's possible to be in love with 2 people, yes.    Keep in mind, it's ok to love someone or even be in love with them and realise logically they are not the right person for you.  Think carefully about your decision.  Good luck!|`|AA11592513	Once a cheater always a cheater!!!!!!!!beware. I spent 10yrs of my life in an on again off again relationship with a cheater. They just never stop!!!!|`|AA12342088	It is possible to be in love with two people at the same time as long as you have not made a commitment to either person to love only one of them.  However, you need to learn from your past mistakes and make better choices.  I would not give  1 of 4 years and heartbreak the time of day.  You are to good to settle for that.
AA12291003	i wouldn't have told her he was flirting because some ppl do that all the time and you could even have misintepreted his being friendly for flirting so NO you wouldn't have anything really to tell.    now, you like her soon to be ex- keep this info to yourself until she hooks up with someone else and ya might wanna play matchmaker to hurry things along.

Em segundo lugar, cuide da tua vida espiritual. N?o tenha medo de buscar a Deus sempre que precisar de uma orienta??o, de ajuda, de qualquer coisa! Deus  amor e quer te ajudar! Em terceiro lugar, pare de olhar tanto para o que voc n?o tem e tire uma hora do seu dia para agradecer! Quando voc consegue ver o tanto que Deus j te deu, fica surpreso, cada dia  uma ddiva! E por ltimo, mas n?o menos importante, aprenda a ser perseverante em tudo, escolha as suas lutas (aquilo que vale a pena) e tente com todas as for?as alcan?ar suas metas, n?o desanime no primeiro n?o, ou na primeira derrota. Mas nunca use meios fraudulentos ou ilicitos pra conseguir o que deseja, o que  teu est te esperando e voc vai conseguir mais cedo ou mais tarde!

Se trouxesse, n?o veramos nenhum rico se suicidando, n?o  verdade?  Voc ama algum? Seu pai? Sua m?e? Uma amiga? Um irm?o? Outras pessoas? Como ser feliz se tem sempre algum que amamos e que est sofrendo com doen?as, desemprego, relacionamentos destrudos, de luto, etc. Todas estas desgra?as vieram por causa do nosso pecado, mas um dia Deus mudar tudo, n?o haver choro, nem dor, nem morte, nem lgrimas. Glria a Deus por isto.  A Palavra de Deus diz que a nossa alma nunca se satisfaz, isto significa que por mais que tenhamos, queremos sempre mais, isto significa que se nunca temos tudo o que queremos, n?o podemos ser totalmente felizes. Mas, podemos ter muitos momentos de gozo e alegria. O apostolo Paulo dizia: "Se temos o que comer e o que vestir, estejamos contentes.  Ent?o se voc quer sentir algo muito prximo da felicidade, contente-se com o que tem. N?o olhe para os que tem mais do que voc, olhe para os milh?es de pessoas que tem menos do que voc e gostaria de estar no seu lugar agora, e seja grato a Deus, como fazem aquelas pessoas l no interior, que moram numa casinha de taipa (barro), que trabalham todo dia na ro?a e est?o sempre sorrindo.

Io subito ho lasciato perdere, ma dopo qualche giorno lho rivisto e ho capito che non potevo tacere: i suoi occhi mi avevano stregato, lui mi aveva incantato.  Ho chiesto il suo numero, ci siamo incontrati ancora...parlando ho capito che non aveva interesse per me...mi trova bella, ma niente di pi. Voleva baciarmi di nuovo, ed io ho fatto finta di non capire.  2 giorni fa lho rivisto, abbiamo parlato e gli ho confessato che sono innamorata di lui...ma visto che lui non ha alcun interesse per me  meglio se non ci vediamo pi. La sua risposta: "Ja" ( tedesco).  Ero abbattuta e mi sono ubriacata...per la prima volta in vita mia. I miei amici lhanno chiamato,  venuto da me ma non ricordo cosa ci siamo detti.  Il giorno dopo (cio ieri) avevo un forte mal di testa e mal di stomaco.  Ora solo male al cuore.    Non lo devo pi cercare, lo so, ma ieri sera ho ascoltato la canzone "I try" di Macy Gray e gli ho mandato questo messaggio:  " I try to say goodbye and I choke  Try to walk away and I stumble  Though I try to hide it, it's clear  My world crumbles when you are not here".    (provo a dirti addio e soffoco,  provo a camminare ed inciampo  sebbene provi a nasconderlo  chiaro,  il mio mondo si sbriciola quando non sei qui)    Ne  seguito poi un altro in cui ho scritto che per favore faccia a meno di rispondere: io dico solo quello che penso, e la verit non ha bisogno di risposte.

af1e93791a065472ed6b6789ee71f749aa	How SMALL is it? There are cities with real friendly areas and small tows that don't let newcomers "in." Have lived in both. Do you work there? Does your job bring you in contact with people (both male and fenale)? If you work elsewhere, what about the people there?   If you are as quiet with stranges and shy as I am, you need to just be around others who are outgoing witout being pushy, overbearing, nosy, fake, etc. There are such. If there are groups that have activities (any type), see if you can try some of them and just be yourself. Don't give off "stay away vibes" like I too often did. I also accidentally found out much later that there were some girls who were interested in getting to know me at a time I was unapproachable (not stuck up - not interested !). I knew a guy who took a course in college (part of his degree) with ONE girl in it. They were maried for about 30 years before she died of cancer. Both very creative, though in different ways. If you can, get a pet that you can take with you a lot when out. I found a puppy in the road and kept her, because she was very special. Did that ever get me all sorts of attention and set tongues in motion? A married neighbor (I knew them both as a couple) asked me, if I'd be interested in a free meal in a fancy joint. All I had to do was go with her friend who was newly divorced. I got more than a free meal - 6 moth relashioship. since most thought I was a confirmed bachelor (was simply single), it got almost as much reaction as my finding the puppy. Then others who I'd been aware of, or known very casually, began showing interest.   A few years ago, I accidentally met a "girl" about 10 years younger than me. We had a lot of similar things in out backgrounds and she was very outgoing. She had married at 42 (1st time) and never really cared, if she did. I was nearly 45 when I did. We were a like lke a brother and sister who got along well.  Niether of us had real ones. Live life and be open and things will happen. I am a life long "car nut." Never met much of anybody working on my vehicles (especially when under them!). My "sister" did not make my wife jealous, because there was no reason to be and, somehow, she knew it. I'd been concerned, as my wife's first husband had split! O course "my sister" and I were never really alone - I never had any desire for that. She was too good a friend! But she changed jobs and moved.   Get into activities more often indulged in by guys - guys should do the opposite! Be yourself. That is so appealing!!!|`|35b426ef4a3e21311d48ca5b6ac491fcaa	Usually the local volunteer fire department have chili cook offs or catfish fry for fund raisers. Depending where you are, they may have a chowder cook off or something.Go to those, and you can meet people there. You could go to book club night if available locally. See what kind of events that your local community center may have going on. Go to church. Just a few things for you to ponder over. Good luck!

Pois no futuro infelizmente, e lembrando que estamos no Brasil, necessitaremos destes mesmos filhos que criamos. Portanto conforme foi seu relacionamento com eles assim ser a atitude deles perante os pais. Na minha interpreta??o da pergunta "O Asilo" que o autor da pergunta cita, poder ser a prpria casa do filho com muito amor que ser dado em reciprocidade e reconhecimento a sua educa??o, ou um Asilo mesmo (casa para idosos), para ficar livre pois achar que seus pais n?o passam de um entrave na sua vida. Portanto cuidem bem de seus filhos, para que os mesmo formem um carter inablavel.|`|de21f793813411984d9a462b9f4fadd4aa	Acho que a resposta certa para esta frase : A gente collhe o que planta, e cuidar de quem a gente ama n?o significa somente amar  mas sim educar e n?o esquecer dos princpios e principalmente ensinar-lhes que DEUS  tudo na vida da gente.|`|7bd4b11df3c748f28203855de3ac39ccaa	acho essa frase perfeita! pois essa  a realidade, se cuidarmos bem de nossos filhos e os educarmos corretamente, nosso asilo poder ser em suas casas se houver necessidade de pedir asilo em algum lugar.

Mas se os pais cultivam um carinho o filho n?o vai quere ver os pais abandonados.Esse asilo  ambguo,e n?o h melhor asilo que o cora??o dos filhos.Porque mesmo com tantas ocupa??es eles n?o guardam magoas. mais ou menos isso.|`|0eb82792f0be667536d6f75b9a971be5aa	S recebemos aquilo que damos.

Tenho 2 filhos e, apesar de ser separado, gra?as a Deus n?o tenho nenhum tipo de problema com eles, pois somos amigos, companheiros e nos respeitamos muito uns com os outros, e sei, tenho certeza que o caminho que eles seguir?o ser o melhor para eles, e n?o estou nem um pouco preocupado se um dia eles v?o cuidar de mim ou n?o, acho inclusive que independncia e liberdade  uma das coisas mais fundamentais que um homem pode e deve conquistar na vida!|`|15f89b33983836f87de3381611a9a55daa	bom eu sou pai solteiro...cuido muito bem do filho de 1 ano 3 meses...fa?o das tripas ao cora??o por ele....agora se ele me colocar no asilo dou-lhe umas bengaladas na cabe?a dele pra ele acordar...|`|ca0722479a69b1e0edeb6fe6bac8eb81aa	Hmmmmm, devo come?ar a economizar bastante no andar da carruagem  melhor eu escolher o meu asilo.|`|afa5b2d517fc08b403c00d7cbf273c19aa	Nessa frase est implicta a teoria da A??o e da Rea??o...

0k2xuCqYaa	First off you want to make sure your lips are nice and moist. No one wants to kiss on a girl with lips like sandpaper lol. Secondly when you both go in for the kiss tilt you head a little. If he tilts his to the left you tilt yours slightly to the right. Close your eyes cause it makes the kiss so much better. Let the man dominate. Let him insert his tongue into your mouth first if you guys are going to french kiss. When he does you just twirl your tongue around his. If you want to make it sexy suck on his bottom then lift his chin up. Give him a soft kiss right their on his adams apple then go in for a hug and twirl your tongue around his earlobe. Works everytime girl!!!|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	it has to come naturally between two people!!|`|rTwsdq6kaa	you gatta tease em. make them want it. make it look like ur about to  kiss and pull back|`|Q3bcGeaOaa	tenderly|`|j6RDbnl6aa	by sucking lips, i believe.  making it sexier? you can always grab his face in your palms, but not aggressively.|`|CFsBX9Nxaa	I dont think you can Actually answer this question.

But, that's a bit grotesque.  According to a popular tv show, you can practice kissing with an orange! Haha.. then please throw it away instead of eating it after you're done.    I think to make it sexier, a great thing to do is to tickle. Not seriously tickling though! Just a light touch. Such as moving your fingers up your person's back an neck. Stuff like that. Or leg. Depends on how far you want to go with the person. Or how much that person's allowing you to do. To maximize the sexiness, it would be great if you guys had a romantic atmosphere (ex. the night) Again, look online for some great romantic and sexy ideas.

vn2Lq7hIaa	I don't think the amount of girlfriends or boyfriends has anything to do with how things will go in your relationship with each other. 28 and 40   seems like they are a universe apart when you say it, but in reality they are only 12 years which is quite acceptable. I bet if you were side by side you would be like an early thirties couple. Age compliments itself.       There are some very youthful gentlemen at 55 and 60 and although I wouldn't recommend that age difference for you, I'm just pointing it out.  A 40 year old has a lot of good loving left, unless you are the 28 year  old horizontally inclined female from hell, you shouldn't have any compatibility problems.    I say go for it, and be happy.

AA11971279	A divorce court is called a court or equity.    That means the judge is looking to balance the scale as best he can.  So it depends on the big picture, kids, and the length of the marriage.    If it was a long marriage then the judge also looks at each persons ability to create an income.|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	It's alot more complicated than that. How long were you married? How many children and who will get them? Did one of you own the house before marriage?

AA12083470	You two agreed to be friends, right?  That is why he probably called you acting as if everything is okay.  In his book, it is.  And I am pretty sure he is calling because he still has feelings for you.  You need to decide whether or not you want him in your life.  If you are pregnant, you need to decide if you want to try to make a relationship work with him, or just keep him at side for future care of your child.  If you don't want to be involved at all due to him being abusive and etc... if that is the case, don't tell him there is a baby.  If he is a good person and would be a good father, then I would tell him, he deserves to know.  If you are pregnant and he wants to try to make it work, then give it a chance.|`|AA12124117	I had a similar problem, only without the pregnancy issue.  If you find out you're not pregnant, sever the ties completely.  Don't answer his calls, don't talk to him, and if you do by accident pick up the phone when he calls, be short and end the conversation right away.  Being nice is sending him mixed signals, and he may think you'd want to reconcile.      If you're pregnant, though, you'll have to maintain a relationship of some kind with him.  Make sure in this situation you are completely honest with him about your feelings.|`|aed81a1a38e8fbd6b930a6c5656d4b3eaa	If you don't want to be with him, then it's over. You can't change your mind because you may be pregnant.    Take a test.....if there was protected sex and everything was done correctly there, I would say it's stress.    You need to make your break-up clear to him. It sounds like he still thinks there is a chance of getting together again.|`|AA11187009	Like u need to make ur question clearer so.

28WJwHf4aa	Do *you* want to have sex with him? If not, don't cave in to his pressure. If he loves you, he'll wait until you are ready.    If you are ready to have sex, there really isn't anything you can do to prepare for it. Just relax and breathe. Make sure he knows you're a virgin, and tell him to take it slow. Be prepared for it to not be all that pleasant. The first time for women is typically painful and not that enjoyable.    Best of luck.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Tell him you've never had sex before and you're nervous. It's your first time. He's not expecting it to be a porn movie come to life.

LHJTrJreaa	If you value your kneecaps... Don't spread rumours. Theres no guarantee you'd get her after they break up anyway =[
wgZVeLZPaa	No. You aren't being punished - you were still wondering if things were right. There's nothing wrong with that.  My suggestion - look her up. My ex from HS found me after 17 years, and we're together now. It can happen!|`|5jMNBO2naa	no  as for your ex GF  she dropped out of med school because she wanted to  not because hubby forced her  quit making out as the victim  she has a mind and makes judgments, both good and bad  she dropped out because she wanted validation from her hubby  and that meant doing what ever to keep her marriage, so for her, at the time, the marriage was more important than school    there is no such thing as the one that is a myth made up into thinking you have to stick to just one person, and only one person in the billion population is for you, how absurb is that. if that were true, then we would not have a 50% plus divorce rate that we have now, as that means so many of the "ones" are not it..  to say  that only one person gets you is to sell yourself short, love can be found anywhere and in any race and creed, all that you do is set limits and settle if you think that way... to say the one is to say the first girl i really like is the one i am sticking with out of fear.. fear of rejection, fear of starting all over gain and so on.. and so the one takes on a mythical status    real estate and car salesman make the same argument when selling you a house / car, that this is the one for you, get it now or forever you will miss out, what a croc, look at all the idiots who panic bought a home out of fear... people do the same thing in love    as for successive nice girls who cheat, well you have to take things a bit slower and see their family backgrounds.. women who come from a 2 parent ( still married ) background are far less likely then one who comes fro ma divorced background, that has been proven, so it's the family background, their religious beliefs, their core beliefs  that will help eliminate ( though not entirely ) the possibility of them cheating on you, your being picky might well be a fine tuning process, in that you over look key signs in women....|`|ae4720dfc89ffd1738b06ebd965dc84eaa	if she was truly the one, your paths will cross soon|`|6ji300csaa	No, I don't believe you're being punished. Actually, you did a pretty SELFLESS thing. You let her go in order for her to follow her dream. You gave her wings so that she could soar. I don't think you'd be punished for that.    I think that you may need to take a time out on the dating scene, because your 'picker' is broken. You've picked some bad apples. You may be intentionally picking some bad apples because you may be subconsciously trying to keep the position open for her. You can't live life that way. You need to figure out if you want her or someone like her. If it is her, what's stopping you from trying to find her? If she's married now or something, that may hurt, but not half as much as never even trying.

Don't let whatever your friends say affect your happiness.|`|ASeQFTFRaa	If you like him, regardless of whether your friends do or not, then date him.   If you don't, then let him know that all you want is friendship.   But do NOT not date him because your friends don't like himn.  They arn't the ones dating him, you are.  But if they don't like him because he is a player, or dangerous, or not on the right track, then you might want to think about where they are coming from.  But if it is because he is a nerd, or some other reason like that, then screw what they say, make your own decisions based on what is right for you, not for them|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	A kiss always can always tell you how you really feel.|`|BYTPpcNZaa	first of all figure out if you like him or not and then go from there|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	same thing happened to me!  if you really like talking to him and stuff, go for it. do NOT let your friends' opinions get in the way. i did. and he dated my best friend. we ended up dating again, though, because i decided that my opinion was more important than my friends'. and it was great. (:|`|AYkGxr0faa	date him. i made a huge mistake by not dating someone based on what my friends thought, or would have thought.    in my opinion, its better to regret dating him than to regret not dating him.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Go through with it and just try it.  You might be confused because you don't know him.|`|spbTzgpzaa	You are the best judge of the situation and you need to know what you want in life|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	Get some time to think. If he gives you the butterflies in the stomach, that's something. People are always confused because they have more things out there to worry about. When you think of him, you start to smile and realize you are back into reality.

rRgS4ss9aa	It depends on her mood. Ladies usually want that kind of stuff when they feel beautiful. I know you put an extra effort to make her feel beautiful, but there are just days where ladies don't feel beautiful despite what people tell them. Since she's also working, maybe there are times where she is so stressed out that she's not in the mood. There are many things that pause the stimulation in one's mind, so it's not your fault.     gah.. sorry I had so many things to share but I lost track of my thinking proccess... SORRY!!! Email me if you need me to elaborate, I'll force my brain to think harder! But meanwhile I hope you can read my miserable-sized non-helpful comment and take something from it. Best of luck!|`|vffZ3is4aa	women are usually hornier when they are fertile. this is followed by pms and then their period. get used to it.|`|fyyzKKqpaa	PMS. sorry but its the truth. And if she didnt want it maybe she had her period? LOL idk.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Yep, hormones play an important role in this behavior!  Its normal!|`|dCmSA6r2aa	she might be bipolar   but yes your desire can swing quite a bit one way or the other|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Yeah, it's normal to have variation in sexual desire from one week to the next because of hormones. It's not normal for her to get mad at you, though. If she's experiencing bad mood swings you need to talk. It could just be PMS, but you need to know if there's something else that's bothering her.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Yah it just depends on hormones and stuff, it's complicated.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	yes actually, or she is trying to put u in ur place, saying she doesn't want when she actually does. she does this so that the next week when she does want u also h@rnier than ever.    and teach u self- control..if u really want to "mess" her up..say no the week she really wants it..(so that its 2weeks without it) oh u might end up with a really mad GF but when u give in (cause she will try and seduce u) u might have the hottest sex ever.    and no its not possible to love too much (unless u psycho)|`|lt58rHeNaa	ya shes pmsing|`|OfYRmdQOaa	yes so normal just make her feel good and problem solved|`|z7jH5N5oaa	yea bitchez be crazy man|`|nN9y3BtTaa	maybe shes on her period every other week|`|Q6usQV1zaa	thats how women are!
wgZVeLZPaa	I would contact the supervisor of the person who wrote the report. That probably wouldn't be hard to find, and if you still have that lawyer - get him/her to do it.  I'm really sorry about your situation. But it looks like you have another battle to fight to get your kids back, and you need exceptional representation.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	look in the yellow pages, find a mal practice lawyer.|`|AA11969451	Call the BAR association and file a complaint if there was unethical conduct on the part of a lawyer.
28WJwHf4aa	It isn't odd to meet someone online and then get married....however, doing so in 1 month is out of the ordinary.     She shouldn't be embarassed by it, but some people just are. She should definitely be happy that she found her soulmate, regardless of the manner she went about doing so! :-)|`|l43NSgHyaa	My friend and I just had this conversation yesterday.  On a personal level, I would never meet anyone online.  To me, it really takes the emotional aspect out of it.  My friend referred to dating websites as, "shopping for a husband."  Which is true.  You can look for a man while sitting in your PJ on a Sunday morning.       I believe in the traditional way of meeting people and dating.  I like the idea of being out somewhere and catching someone's eye or being personal introducted to someone and then forming a relationship from there.  To me, it seems so odd to handpick men online and assess them based on their online profile.      So, for me, when I hear people say they met someone online, I kind of think they just gave up trying the traditional way.     Plus, I always say to people, "well, how did our parent's generation and people before that meet and got married?  They didn't have dating websites and most people found someone and most marriages lasted, unlike today."     But, my opinions are just mine and mine only.     Anyway, should your friend be embarrassed?  If she's happy, she shouldn't worry about it.  She's content and that's all that matters.|`|5jMNBO2naa	she is probably the exception to the rule  , most anything online do not last  is because unless you go out and take the effort to meet face to face  rather than from a profile  you are bound to fail|`|F7O0nLK1aa	she deserves to be proud of finding love, where ever it happened, it is awesome.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I have met a few guys that I have dated online, and its not something that I am embarrassed about at all.  The part that would concern me, would be them getting married so soon after meeting, but as they seem happy with their choice why should it matter how they met.
wgZVeLZPaa	It's a game now. You two are attempting to control a situation that you haven't really talked about without fighting - because fighting shuts you both down and neither of you listen to the other.    You don't trust her? Because she lied about the ex or because she still talks to him?     You guys are now in the no-win power situation, and neither of you are going to win.     What you need to do is sit down and talk about it. Better yet, write down what you want to say and then put it away. Then edit it and then talk to her. That way you look like you thought about what you were going to say, and if she gets defensive then you end the conversation.    Until the two of you talk, though, the games will continue. You need to figure out what kind of outcome you really want from this situation. You want happiness and fidelity? Then you need to try to nip this in the bud without fighting. If you can't, get counseling.|`|XPzdqiC0aa	Maybe she is spying on you to show you how it feels... (i dunno) i actually agree with you tho.. the lying has to stop and you never gave her a reason not to trust you... I assume you talked to her about it? maybe marriage counseling...?|`|i7XkKqhgaa	ok tell her if she doesnt stop talking to him that you will need to go 2 a marriage councilor. me and my husband both stopped talking to our ex  s cause it was hurting both of us. the thing with girls is, we all look at our bf/husbands fone accounts. there isnt a girl out there. one we get curious and 2 we get a good feeling when we dont find some bimbo's number on it|`|y21VcTjDaa	You two are as bad as one another when it comes to trust issues....you obviously don't trust her as is evidenced by the fact that you check her phone and track her movements on the computer and she equally doesn't trust you as seen by the fact that she checks your phone also.  You sound very controlling so that's probably why she "spins" things in hopes that you won't blow up.  She's a grown woman and while I don't think being that friendly with her ex is a good idea, the bottom line is you can't choose her friends.  If you can't deal with her actions you have the choice to leave.  It's unfortunate that she chooses to behave like this but it sounds like you are no treat either.|`|jAGwyyuyaa	She's spying on you to gather info. in case you throw something at her about her friend. But she is probably getting frustrated with that, cause you are not doing her, like she's doing you. And why did you marry her knowing what you know? People always think marriage will change a person. It don't. People have to want to change. You can't force them too.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	While I'm not condoning her dishonesty, why did you not want her talking with him?  You stated you are sure she hasn't cheated on you.  Great.  So what's the problem?  He is her EX boyfriend and they are now FRIENDS.  You express you are upset that she has checked your phone records, but you are justified because she gave you a reason to?  You two have a lot more problems than her ex.  Instead of all the game playing, lying and arguing, how about some couple counseling to see if you two should even stay together.|`|60GmMBr7aa	If you truely love her you'll forget all about because she your's now and that was the past were not perfect we make mistakes just let it go and love her!|`|igLsH24Qaa	People tend to believe that most people are like themselves.  She is lying about her phone use so she suspects you do the same. you guys need counseling or you need to end this before children get involved.|`|3VeNR1sGaa	The only way for you to get the answers you need is to talk to your wife. Tell her that you're uncomfortable with her talking so much to her ex because she is married now, and ask her why she is checking your phone information. Maybe she does have a reason.     Or maybe you're just extremely paranoid.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	You both are spying and lying to each other, you are not in anymore of the right or wrong then she is, your checking up on her and shes checking up on you, is it wrong she is talking to her ex, I would probably have some concerns about it, would I go as far as spying, no I would confront my partner and ask them, and then I would have to make a choice to trust my partner, or not to trust my partner, and if I didn't trust my partner, there would be no relationship.    Maybe you both need some marriage counselling, sounds like there are a lot of issues here, and I am not convinced that you two on your own after confessing both your secrets would rationally talk to one another, you might need someone to mediate you through this process.|`|RcNXBLnPaa	well if she keeps lying to you,, is cuz you guyz didnt spend enough time talking before you guyz got married and you should of lasted another year before getting married if it keeps going i suggest you guyz devores cuz its not gonna work out|`|b149638f589a0f8f7f940f9dd1ea3de4aa	Okay, you're going to do what you want to do but here is my two cents...  She's still seeing her ex. She checked on your phone records to see if you were talking to someone else to somehow justify her talking to her ex.   I'm not sure why she married you if she is still talking to this guy. He may just provide emotional support or she is with you for the wrong reasons. Like if you have money, or are stable, or are going to school to be a doctor or lawyer or something.   Good luck.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	she sounds pretty immature. some people are just compulsive liars and cannot help lying about little things for no reason. personally, I find this amazingly annoying, and it seems you do as well. because of this, trusting her completely will be difficult. I think that you need to talk to her about how you feel about this, and potentially seek some counseling over the trust and lying. it may seem like a smaller thing now, but this could easily spin into a larger issue as time goes on. nip it in the bud before it goes too far. good luck!|`|uRulL6xyaa	Because she want to know if you're talking with your ex-gf like she is doing now.|`|RZs3Wt7Vaa	DUDE! Talk to her. Ask her, show her, I mean, also talk to her EX. Stand up for yourself DUDE!|`|g6MiGWuJaa	i hear sometimes guilty people think the other person is doing the same thing because they are>?|`|AA10010935	If you knew your wife was a liar, why did you marry her in the first place?   Honesty is so important in a marriage.    Probably one of the reasons why she is spying on you, is to see if you're cheating or not, so then she'll think she has just cause to cheat on you.   But one thing that could be possible, is that she is doing this to you because she is already cheating with this guy.    If you can't trust her, and she continues with the lies, I honestly don't see how your marriage is going to last.   If you want this to work, you might want to consider marriage counselling.  Remember, you picked her, it's up to you how things will turn out.|`|WEt3thrnaa	If your wife is spying on you when you have not given her any reason to suspect you, then what generally holds true applies - which is:    Liars are always the most suspicious of other people.     If she lives her life being less than honest, she probably assumes most people (including you) are just as dishonest. I think you should confront her and tell her that you don't trust her and ask why she lies to you. She may have lied about the ex because she honestly wants to be good friends with him and knew that letting the info slip on their past relationship would hurt their friendship now that you are in the picture. Honestly, if they wanted to be together, they would be and she chose you. Talk to your wife.
AA11313793	I am sorry to say this but yes, he is cheating on his girlfriend with you.  You are her "other woman" and that is not right for either of you.  You need to tell him that he needs to make a decision on who he wants to be with.  He cannot have his cake and eat it to.|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	i consider anything you wouldnt want the other person in the relationship to know cheating. yes, thats cheating. if his girlfriend saw, she'd be pretty pissed, right?|`|izeAVxy0aa	would you like it if some girl was doing that with ur bf? of course u wouldn't. lay off him. don't be the other woman...or in ur case other girl.|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	emotionally, yes. how would his gf feel if she knew this? ask him that.|`|6QvilEZ1aa	YES....how would you feel if it was your boyfriend doing all of those things with another girl?|`|DZP8b9sXaa	Yeah sort of kind of.  He's sneaking behind his girfriend's back and kissing all up on you.  You better watch out smells like player to me.|`|toQ3ZSKTaa	Oh yes it is, 1). He's taken, respect that, and end the "kissing" 2). If you love him, let him go, because he may be leading you on or trying to set you up as a rebound just in case their relationship ends. I'm sorry for I know it isn't what you want to be hearing. Best of Luck|`|UU8JTBYTaa	Yep, it's cheating alrite! Put a stop to it immetiately!!!
wgZVeLZPaa	This is what I found:      There are only three grounds for divorce in Canada:    1. living 'separate and apart'* for more than one year;  2. adultery (cheating); and  3. mental or physical cruelty.    *'Living separate and apart' does not necessarily require 'physical separation' - you can be 'living separate and apart' but share your home for economic reasons, or children, etc. If you are filing for divorce based on separation, you can make the first filing before you have been separated for one year, however the second filing cannot be made until on or after the one year anniversary of 'living separate and apart'.    For a divorce in Ontario based on separation, you can file your divorce after your separation begins - however, the divorce cannot be finalized until you have been separated for a full year.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	I do not think so, as sometimes it is very difficult - finances for example.    In my opinion it is not necessary to live separately before filing for a divorce.    But to make sure, ask a lawyer.|`|vdpKJkGuaa	One of my girlfriends just used her friend's address.  They were a good, happy couple with no problems (just in case anything came up in court) so she just used their address.  Her and her ex-husband lived in the same house due to financial reasons until they could sell the house and afford to both find something separately.|`|xmmX3JTRaa	I do not think you have to live separately but sometimes it helps to think things over, and often a couple decide not to file for the divorce. They realize how much they miss and love each other, realize their mistakes and often the relationship can be fixed.
fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	there are plenty of fish in the sea but this fish is thru with you, or he would be calling you.  Get over him by keeping busy.

In time you'll be ready to meet someone new and exciting.|`|fyyzKKqpaa	if he's treating you like taht and making you feel that way dump him now!  then you won't have to go through the pain of getting dumped.|`|f25peTSXaa	cut off all contacttttt  i know its hard babe  but trusttt me  i went through the same thing  sometimes guys take girls for granted  till they realize what they have  dont be bitchy at all     just act busy like you've lost a little interest  so he'lll painic |`|CpfJxUfBaa	Just because he is not talking to you as much there is not really any reason to panic. He may be getting more comfortable around you and not feel it is all that needed. Don't smoke, drinking is nice though.|`|WjMalAU5aa	first dont smoke or drink because of that.......But just talk to him, to be honest with you not to hurt your feeling but i use to do the same thing when i got ready to break up with a girl.......sorry|`|bxUjRKWLaa	try talk to him about it in any little chance you get, show him what you wrote here so he understands how you feel.    if he dosent listen or dsnet care, move on because y be depressed and sad if he dont give a f***.   but on the other hand he might just be bisy and might of hafd to get of the phone?   you wont know till you ask.    good luck hunn  xx|`|h7pohYmyaa	i know how you feel being left in the dark.. i feel that way right now... put down the bottle, and stop smoking, those only cover up the problems for a short bit.. call him, go to his house something... talk to him.. the worst is him breakign up wiht you, just remember theres millions of people in this world it just takes patience to find the right one
13dded66b3bbf7efd78d04740e1abec3aa	Sounds like you might have a bought of situational depression. Talk to a family doctor and talk with him. He can recommend something to help. In the meantime, try to Surround your self and your space with positive things. I know it is hard to do, but try.   You could also go to a store that specializes in vitamins, minerals and herbs. They sometimes have a nutritionist on staff that can recommend some things to help.|`|wlRqQGRBaa	Hmm..I think you'll be ok. You have to think positive. If your family is putting you down dont hang around so much. Stay active, dont sit around and dwell on yourself feeling down. Keep your head up!!
y43tzOQlaa	Documentation,Documentation, If you keep documentation on his abusive behavior HR cannot avoid it. They will only consider complaints with proof. They cannot do anything on he said she said and of course they usually go with upper management, that's office poitics. Keep a journal, date it and make sure you have witnesses that herd the abuse. They don't have to witness your journal but you make sure their names are in your journal that they were in the room. It may come down to their word against yours but if you are keeping it written down that will hold some value. Next I would ask for a meeting with him and a supervisor to get some ground rules. You have the right to be treated fairly and if your pending pregnancy depends on how your stress levels are than you go to the dr. and end up on disability or stress leave, they can then pick how they want to treat you. Stand strong but not to the health of your self or your child.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	innocent flirting could make him go away or treat you better, then again later on it would be a pain if he actually tried to advance

lMKy9Ho8aa	just say thank you and move on about your business!!|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	i think you should work on your looks since people of 20 years older are flirting with you so if you look better then you can attract the younger ones|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	If the older guys are just being nice, just say thank you and walk. If they are seriously trying to pick you up, I would say, "You are old enough to be my father! Shame on you!" and still walk.  There is nothign wrong with you dating a guy a little older than yourself, but the geezers are trying to pick up a younger girl and that is just ewwwwww!|`|maEf1oBAaa	As a guy I usually say something like...  "Listen, those compliments might work on other guys, but I'm not that easy, so just lay off."    Girls usually find that hilarious.    But as for old guys flirting with you, I'd recommend being nice enough to give them your time, but obviously you don't need to give them your number if you don't want to.  Don't be too mean, it takes a lot of courage to walk up to a girl and talk to her.  You should take it as a compliment, it means you're good looking enough that the guys picked you out of any other girl nearby.|`|56XwyVW9aa	Us older guys (42) LOL., have gotten used to rejection a lot more than the younger guys in there 20's and therefore are more confident. When you go to a bar you will notice a Lot of good looking guys in there twenties that are to SHY and not confident enough to approach a woman!    I do not think it is you, since you seem to place yourself where younger men can approach you.|`|36cdYOKbaa	I agree with Fivea, if you're attracting older men, and that's not your intention, then it's the way you're dressing most likely, or doing your hair, or makeup.  AND you have to go where the younger guys go.  Go to a trendy store in your town, pick up some fashion magazines, give yourself a makeover  and have fun being young!   As for how to respond to these older guys if they just give you a compliment and you don't want to encourage anything else, DON'T SAY ANYTHING, JUST WALK AWAY OR TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM.  If they keep bothering you, then get nasty, like tell them to get lost or something, you don't have to be nice LOL.  While those old dues are in your face, some younger dude could've been checking you out.|`|HuaNucH6aa	say Thank you for being so honest|`|WjMalAU5aa	old dudes always try to hit on younger attractive women....If they like you then younger people like you too|`|9WoSt2Szaa	i agree with creolegirl

He will never change except to get much much worse over time as long as you stay there and he will hurt you badly eventually. He needs to stop drinking and go to AA but he will never do anything to help himself as long as he has you to victimize. You must get away from him NOW and let him take care of himself and do not listen to his excuses his crying his apologies because they are all fake, all he cares about is his next drink.|`|E7TkNO00aa	18 is still a young age to get married. If you have quit drinking for a month, congratulations and don't stop. If he verbally abuses you, the next thing is that he will lay a hand on you. You can support him by taking him to AA and being on his side, and if he is not willing to change, for your safety and well-being, leave him and get a divorce. Good Luck.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	many people just go to AA & get support. try it. use the internet to find a group & just tune into who the good people are & who the trouble makers are & you might met all good people. You can find many meetings going on & both of you go.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	If you love him, I think he needs an intervention. I would suggest AA for you, and you can talk to someone about getting help for him. Unfortunately, he has to make the decision to quit. You can't make him. He has an addiction that can pop up any time, and even with treatment that doesn't mean he's "cured". But you both probably could use some help, and a neutral third-party can be the one to do that.    Also, it depends on what you want out of the marriage. Do you want to stay with him while he goes through this? Can you handle it when he stumbles? Think about this. I wish you the best.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	You both need help as soon as possible. The best option would be to go to rehab and try to fight your problems together, supporting each other.    you know you have a problem. Now, try to convince your husband. But do not wait for to long. If he does not listen then go alone and help at least yourself.    Good Luck,|`|5jMNBO2naa	divorce  he has made his choice  the bottle over you  you make you choice  your sanity and self respect over the bottle|`|T3IEyyGAaa	you need to let him know that if he doesnt stop what hes doing, he will lose you. if he doesnt stop.. then you need to leave him...|`|X6C6kZKKaa	the best advise i can give you is. high tail it out of there now.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Video tape him without him knowning, sometimes when we see ourselves at our worst, we can change for the better. I only suggest this if and if ONLY you are not in any physical danger, or he is not emotionally abusing you.  If his drunken behaviour is starting to become abusive, leave, period. Dont stay, protect yourself, and leave.    I hate to say it, but its hard to live with an addict, especially one who doesn't realize they even have a problem, and their behaviour only gets worse  and I hate to disappoint you more , but its even harder to be someone who has a problem who also has a spouse that has a problem, you both may need to consider treatment individually addiction|`|NLAek2bJaa	My husband drinks a lot too, more than me as well. He knows I dont like it, but that wont stop him! You need to talk to him calmly when hes not drinking and say I dont want to fight, but just let him know how you feel and its causing a problem. If you want to work it out, you need to discuss with him options to work through it but he needs to be willing to talk to you about it, if not, theres a huge problem. Communication plays a big role in a marriage. Thats why a lot of people divorce cause they dont talk. Thats why Im still happily married even though we have fought over a lot even the drinking!   Maybe ask him to make a goal to cut it down a bit... slowly! I asked my hubby to just try it.. and he started drinking other things around me other than beer. He will always drink to the fullest out on parties but he has gotten better than before! Its very hard to completely stop guys from drinking but just see if he will cut it down for you and take that effort showing that he cares for you! Maybe you guys wont fight anymore if it happens!|`|UrNMuhFKaa	(800) 331-2900 Hotline|`|jAGwyyuyaa	5 yrs of drinking and fighting. He's a straight up alcoholic. He's hooked. Best to make a move. It's not going to get better unless you make him see what he is loosing. That be you. Girl you are 23. You can do better than that.|`|xmmX3JTRaa	It looks like both of you have serious problem. Try to convince him to get help, but if he refuses go and get help for yourself and do it asap, before your problem becomes more serious.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	Tell him to join a group to try and stop the drinking.   If he has no interest in improving his life...  Leave him.|`|4Fz36SYIaa	no doubt you should divroce asap. it sound like the worse rleationship ever! oh my god sorry but youj sound like so stupid. don;t kill your self no way!!! why for him? no way! start a new life and stop drinking. what a terrible relationship oh my god!|`|iJZzGms2aa	well idk if this will help but in my college psych class we learned about conditioning..so associate something disgusting or bad with him drinking and whenever he drinks or thinks about drinking he will get sick and wont like doin it.. for example do somethin to make him sick whenever he drinks..idk if that will work but our psych teacher was talkin bout it..good luck|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	move out. seriously. leave and get a separate place or stay with a friend until his issues are under control. not only is his behavior abusive, but being around the drinking will make you more likely to want to drink yourself. if you are doing well controlling your vice, don't compromise that. you guys can work on the issues through counseling while living separately. if things can be mended, then you'll know. if not, you can get a divorce with the knowledge that you tried to make it work and are doing what is best for you (both of you, really). if you feel so strongly that you are that depressed, you need to get out and seek help accordingly. maybe get personal counseling for yourself in addition to couples counseling. if your husband is not willing to take such actions... get out. you have your answer about his commitment level and can get into a better situation for yourself. you are still young. good luck!|`|AA10010935	This is an unhealthy relationship that you're in.    But it's up to you how you handle this.     If it were me, I would divorce him.   If you want to be with him, you are going to have to decide what you want to happen.    If you want the drinking to stop, you're going to have to be very tough with him, starting with getting him to go to Rehab.  If he refuses then leave him.     But it  wouldn't hurt for you to go to treatment as well and get some counselling.  If you both want to stay married you have to smarten up and get help.   Whatever you do, don't bring kids into the picture until you both get your act together.   Hopefully you don't have kids already, because they don't deserve to have alcoholics for parents.  Sorry for being so blunt.|`|FUtcuFmjaa	Let him know that if he really loved you then you would be priority over getting drunk. Let him know he isn't the same guy when he is drunk. Let him know what he does to you when he is drunk. (most drunks forget the next day) You have to put your foot down and tell him its you or drinking. If he isn't trying then he probably doesn't take you seriously about it. Tell him all these things when he is sober. If he doesn't get serious and try then you should leave.  If not for good just long enough to scare him.  Don't be surprised if he doesn't come around right away he will probably drink more when you leave to try and forget about it.  Give him some space.  Go do your own thing.  Once he starts to see that you are serious maybe things will change.  I have been in your shoes and that is the only way I got my man to quit.  There is always the possibility that he won't quit and that isn't your fault he is going to have to hit his rock bottom in order to change.  If that is the situation you can either help him or leave for good.  The choice is up to you.  Hope this helps.
wzqahEqiaa	I think it's more important if people respect each other and have a strong friendship.  Respect, good communication, honestly, and faithfulness are the foundation for a lasting marriage.  Opposite personalities can attract and people get along great or it can be a disaster.|`|5jMNBO2naa	more important are core beliefs  if those are not as common, then personality will not matter long term|`|VMAhim63aa	no your gonna hate each other|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I think it's okay, and sometimes good, for there to be a few personality differences.  Two people can work well together when different ideas can be exchanged.  The important thing is that a couple agree where values and goals are concerned.  In other words, it won't work well in the long term if one desperately wants children and the other doesn't want any.  Things like religious beliefs, career goals, and future plans need to mesh or at least be mutually understood and agreed upon.  Personality differences alone shouldn't be a major problem.|`|sa0EwdvEaa	i have nothing in common with my bf but we have been together for 2 years now, so yeah i think so..everything is new i guess...|`|H2bpuDsKaa	Couples who are one another's best friends make good long term relationship matches.........|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	There is no formula to a relationship. If there was there would be a best-seller and hardly any divorces.  Its all in what attracts YOU. everyone is different and requires different things. Yes, its good to have things in common so you can enjoy things together, and being different is good so you can "experience" new things and conquer new grounds.  The main thing you both need in common is the will to "commit" and have God in your life. THE END!
wIblztSzaa	seeing that you sent the papers certified mail the signed receipt shows that you have nad a Honest attempt to contact him and a detailed phone bill will tell the same.  so you don't have a problem there.  depending on the state you live in and the laws governing divorce tou might have to start all over again.  if you have been separated for a tear it would be considered abandonment, and yes you can ask for the 1500 from him plus court cost|`|Hizsm6m4aa	I don't know how true this is, but I heard if you post it in the newspaper and get no response it is ok for you to proceed on your own.|`|4Fz36SYIaa	no please don;t be mean and forget the $1500! it's enough sffering you are causing the poor guy divorcing him.  However no worries! - there are ways to get divorce after one year of separatrion automatically. also, obviously he is not responding so don;t waste your energy . he is doing it on purpose. good luck
WE2Njwr9aa	don't be to much of a nice guy cause girls will run all over you, never buy them gifts early in a relationship women see this as compensating for something you are lacking or insecurity. Do be moderately cocky and humorous and have her see you as the prize. and she will be eating out of the palm of your hand...|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Just talk to her don't bribe her get to know her get her digits and talk on the phone, text if you both have it also lol!
QhgvziIRaa	If your ex is showing you a little bit of interest, or seems more interested in going out and spending time with you than before, or if you notice signs that your ex is trying to flirt with you, then it's okay to be a little hopeful but you need to avoid jumping the gun. Are you asking yourself "does my ex want to get back with me"?     These are definitely very common signs that your ex is interested in getting you back. But even if you want to get back with your ex, you should not simply jump into things. The best way to play things is to play hard to get (in moderation), which is probably what your ex will best respond to anyway. If you simply jump into things full force, then you may find your ex pushing you back again. In fact, if your ex is giving indications that he or she wants you back, then the odds are, it was you playing hard to get that led to the renewed interest in the first place.    Usually when you break up with your ex, or he or she breaks up with you, there is a natural level of missing one another, or longing to get back together. This is especially true following a relationship of a year or longer. Your ex is probably going to miss you no matter what, because of how many memories were shared together during this period of time. But there are other emotions that come into play including past regrets. If you are wondering "does my ex want to get back with me" the odds are that your ex may be thinking the same thing for the same reasons.    Sometimes when an ex shows interest again following a break up however, it is only a game. They may see that you love them, and they may simply be trying to get attention, without actually intending to get you back. So, unless your ex really seems genuinely interested in spending time with you, they may just be passing the time because they have no other prospects on the horizon. And worst of all they  may see this as away to get revenge for some perceived wrong. This is why it is important not to jump the gun, and why you should focus on reading into the situation before you act on it.     This is common, and a lot of people find themselves wondering "does my ex want to get back with me?", but the truth is, its better to get a feel for the situation before you act. In reality, if your ex does want to get back with you, playing hard to get (in moderation) is the best scenario because it will prevent you from getting hurt if your ex is not really serious about getting back with you.|`|vC57LWaDaa	trying never killed anyone
wgZVeLZPaa	Because you need to know you are the man in her life. But it's ok to feel that way - it's normal. But don't be a jerk about it. You need some reassurance, so go up to her while she talks to the guys and say "Hey, who are your friends?" You being cool about it will make her appreciate you for not being the seething, jealous guy lurking and giving dirty stares at her and the guys while sitting alone.|`|E7TkNO00aa	If you still feel that jealousy inside you, that means you still love your girlfriend or that you still have feelings for her. Why don't you invite her out for dinner and a movie, and tell her that you want to get back with her. You never know, she might be feeling the same way as you. It scares you that another guy is looking at her. Good Luck.|`|izeAVxy0aa	because ur insecure. when u grown up and mature u hopefully will overcome it|`|eMiIJj9Jaa	What the other people said. Ur scared shes going to leave you for one of them one day...|`|j05Xt00Kaa	it is the man's ego against other man... we feel jealous or betrayed when we saw our partner talking to other men. do we feel the same thing when she's talking with other girls?! NO, right?! trust issues need to consider.. hope this helps|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Because you believe that those other men have more going for them than you do.  That's full-blown insecurity.  Do you believe that she could that easily find a man to replace you?  If so, then you have a lot of low self-esteem rolling around inside of you that gets triggered when your GF is friendly with another man.  She can't fix that for you.  You need to fix that yourself.  Counseling helps.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	You have low self-esteem.  Just realize that she has a choice to be with you.  She can be with anyone in this whole world - and she's with you!  Doesnt that say something to you? Arent you worth that?  Dont worry about her. If she wanted to leave, she would have done it already.  You got her!......relax, have a glass of tea and read a book|`|X6C6kZKKaa	because you are the jealous one in the group. there is nothing wrong with talking. and she is just your girlfriend. not your wife. jealousy will get you nowhere. i will repeat nowhere.
809beeb5663bc334259fa3a21d2f9929aa	This is what I did! My husband had 3 groomsman (his brother and 2 cousins) and I had my 2 cousins as bridesmaids and another cousin who is 13 as a Jr, She was paired with a 6'4'' guy. She wore the same colours as the other bridesmaids but a different dress. Everyone commented on how it was very good that we didnt put her in the same dress as it suited her age and not one person thought it was strange she was paired with a groomsman.    All the best and do what YOU want :)|`|eDl5yr44aa	You can have any one you want...it depends on how close to them you feel. I had a man as my "maid of honor". It doesn't imply any relationship between them and your fiance's picks. (Although my husbands best man did ask my male "MOH" to dance, it was all in fun).     This is a celebration of the joining of your lives, not a performance. Don't worry about other people's preferences (you'll never please every one). Do what you want to do. It's your wedding.     Good luck!|`|hkwBR1moaa	I personally would think it's a little weird.  I'm sorry!|`|w4LKvr0daa	uh, I really don't see the problem, it's not like they're the ones getting married or anything.|`|iYWEwg0Maa	It depends on how her family feels.  If they're ok with it, I think it would be cute!  You could also make her the candle lighter-(that's what I did).  But if it's just for walking down the aisle and a couple pictures, I think it would be fine.  If you expect them to dance together and sit together at dinner, I think that may be pushing it a little.|`|v66sauD1aa	Chica! I doesn't matter about their ages, it's not them who are getting married! It's you!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	My niece is 12 and she is going to be my junior bridesmaid, I think this is perfectly acceptable, they arent kissing, they dont even have to dance if they dont want to, just have you and your hubby to be do the dance if you think that this part might be a little awkward, but really there isn't anything intimate between a bridesmaid and a groomsmen
36cdYOKbaa	Well, she's 14 LOL, that's the answer.  Her metabolism and fast, but don't worry by the time she's 18 she'll be a big fat cow if she continues to eat like a pig and not get any excerise.  You'd better let her know she's genetically predisposed to being fat, and to start munching on some carrot sticks and brocoli or she's gonna be sorry|`|lRpMDCAMaa	She could have a fast metabolism, and she could also have bulimia.    The first is okay, the second not so much.    I'm not saying you should accuse her of it, but that was my first instinct.|`|ODbwZsnoaa	probably a really fast metabolism.  it's not healthy though.  cause she has a bunch of junk in her body; nothing healthy D:|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Once she stops growing, all those sweets will probably catch up to her. It did with me.|`|IPS3hWweaa	High metabolism buddy! Young people are able to eat a lot more than adults without gaining weight. This won't continue for the rest of her life, at some point (when she reaches her late 20 or early 30s) all the food she eats will pile up as fat on her body. Its just a matter of time.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Maybe she has a REALLY fast metabolism. Google it.|`|Bru5jJZraa	Ha, I'm 19 and less than 90lbs.    She probably has a fast metabolism like me, it's an advantage right now cuz we can eat whatever we want and not gain a pound :)|`|qIwiGY0Caa	Her metabolism is just fast. That might allow her to eat like that now but eventually it will slow down and she'll have to get better eating habits.|`|ASeQFTFRaa	she just has a super fast metabolism, but when she gets older and it slows down, she will have to adjust her eating habits fast, or else she will be extremely obese.  it happend to my friends cousin.|`|hjhHsHMNaa	She must have a very active metabolism! Does you participate in any sports? This may contribute as well.|`|7sxGW40qaa	Metabolism?  But if she abuses it then she WILL be fat someday, so help her eat better please|`|47bd091e352a1041ddc990445284a7e2aa	She probably has Tape Worms.|`|PZLqQkstaa	Some people have, naturally, a very fast metabolism. Maybe that's how your girlfriend is. Also, some people don't really show fat, it just hides, especially if there is no muscle, the fat could take its place. That is very bad. Hint to your girlfriend that she needs to start excercising. :)|`|gunmTqYlaa	I found out about this a couple of weeks ago:    The main reason why people who still eat alot but don't become fast is because they eat there food slowly. The faster you eat the fatter you get. I think its because if you eat slowly you digest faster.|`|7GQ5TUq6aa	Either fast metabolism(genetics) or an eating disorder, which plague so many young woman today. If you don't already know about this, look up bulimia.|`|LbtU8iWAaa	i know this cute girl that isint that skinny but she weighs 63lbs at the age of 12
hBbgjasQaa	Better go to dance school. It will help u in ur profession and also find new friends of ur line
odoEZC0Haa	I say nothings wrong.    She sounds jealous, but i could understand why. She would feel really weird around you two, and may feel you guys might not have time for her anymore.    Maybe you could very gradually start going out with him. Like just as friends, just close friends, then like 3 months later say you are boyfriend and girlfriend then.    I don't know why she would stop being your friend because of it. If it was me, i would just be weirded out for a while. Then i'd get over it, and probably be happy because two of my friends really like each other.|`|0KmJwYunaa	All's fair in love and war.|`|cWfTvJTcaa	You're not too close but you share clothes? What?    Anyway, she has no claim over him or you. She has her boyfriend. You can start dating this guy. If she gets upset, you can each tell her (on your own, not together - and don't use the word "we") that you want to continue to be her friend. Then, follow through on this promise. Hang out with her without the guy, and he can hang out with her without you. If you are good about it, she will come around. Friendship takes work, so if you really want to be with this guy and you really want to be her friend, this is what you must do. If she doesn't want you together for her own selfish reasons, then she may not be the best friend for you. Why would you want a friend who doesn't want you to be happy? If she gets angry and refuses to be your friend after you get together, then maybe it's time to let the friendship go. It would be sad for you to lose a friend, but it just shows that your friendship is a one-way street for her: all take and no give.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Sorry, but she's right. This is likely going to end your friendship. It will never be the same. That's just the way it works. You'll have to choose one or the other.     What is more, I'm willing to bet that the REAL reason she doesn't want you to is because SHE is interested!!

When she does make these plans, don't constantly ask her about them as an excuse to talk.|`|G76XGyU2aa	That happens to me! My boyfriend is always calling me or texting me we are always communicating with each other.  But sometimes it gets really annoying when he just texts to know were in at or asking me what i keep doing i feel like he doesn't trust me sometimes. We just need a little more space. Maybe try not sending messages as much and giving her a little bit more space. Send her messages saying you love her out of no were.

She doesn't touch you because she doesn't want sex because she feels it is too soon and she's probably afraid if she touches you then you'll take this as a sign to go one step further.    Give her the respect she deserves, be satisfied with what you're getting, and the next thing will happen when she feels ready, push her, and she's likely to dump you because you make her feel cheap.

Why do you want to be mad when you could smile and makes someone elses day?|`|AA12319427	keep sucking **** , life won't suck then...
AA12062019	Kiss it's more passionate|`|AA11222119	kiss, but then i will start hugging and then............|`|4b49b6dee82c8b0993108c56507c50a3aa	hug|`|AA12364746	Both... Kissing while hugging.....|`|AA12319595	Can't decide, I like both.|`|AA11805725	Both :) :)
AA12037447	Nop. What's the gurantee that he will not leave u in future 4 another gal!|`|AA11825912	Well according to the song, no.    Married men do not leave their wives.  It's been three years and he hasn't left her yet, and why should he?  You are dumb enough to give him what he wants and be second-best and sit on the sidelines, why shouldn't he have his cake and eat it too?|`|AA11373055	Yes if he really wants to be with you. But its up to the person to figure out if the dude is ginuine with his feelings or if he is using the other woman as a booty call.|`|02033926a802b2ff589d85e6562d6852aa	I would say no. Its been 3 years and he hasnt left his wife yet? i dont care what the reason is for not leaving her. Hello!! You are being used!|`|AA12102221	Realistically, no. Only a small amount of married men leave their wives for their girlfriends. I wouldn't even want him too because I would be afraid he would cheat on me.|`|AA11444626	Not unless you aspire to be a homewrecker.|`|AA11399027	hehe..yes, im married to a man now that i use to date while he was married to someone else.|`|8f6ebaef80eace0b7338193ccff40b96aa	Sure there is.  I was more than happy to give up my husband when he cheated.    Any smart woman would.  Once a cheater always a cheater...and not worth having around.  So do that lady a favor and take the trash out for her.....and put it in your house.  That's all either of you deserve......trash.|`|9209b64a40921eea684e435b1420eb02aa	It all depends on how you want to spend your future. You can't be sure he will leave her. If it's already been 3 years then he's probably staying with her and you are just for fun. Only you know what you will put up with and how long you want to wait. Alittle warning: he may never leave her. You maybe left still alone.
AA12395108	I've had a panty fetish since puberty.    I used to feel guilty about it... I'd buy panties, wear them then purge my collection.    I thought I could stop when I got married.  I was afraid to tell my wife about it because I felt ashamed.  I couldn't stop.  One day, my wife was in the mood for romance while I was wearing my panties.  I was caught.  It ended in a big arguement.    I still wear panties almost every day, but I don't involve my wife in my fetish.  Now, she'll ask me if I need to "freshen up"  so I have an opportunity to put on "man pants" before we get intimate.|`|AA11919385	I have a panty fetish where I love to see all kinds of women wearing panties.  I love the prize inside of a woman's panties.|`|AA11373055	Nope you're alone PERVERT!!!!!  LOL :oP|`|AA12252447	No I most certainly do not!|`|AA12240339	I like to have nice panties on all the time. i have like 40 to 60 pair of panties all really nice ones. I always take pride in my bras and panties.|`|AA11660937	yes, i love wearing them.  i cant stop thinking about them.  when i have them on i am very submissive and can only think of being dominated.  when i cant wear them i only wish i had them on.|`|AA11971236	I love to see a woman in panties. I like touching them before "moving on"...it's a real turn on for me.|`|AA10323756	Yes! I love panties. I love looking at women in panties. Panty lines. I wear soft, silky panties and I love a woman's scent in a pair of panties. I don't show off. It's a very private thing that only my wife and I share.|`|2ca391243fe0ddf9a87d1b26f9b4b27baa	no i don't have a panty fetish but i like to wear panties
AA12284296	What does he think you are, a moron? Hey, let him go, if he is doing this, you can bet, he'll do ti over & over again. Don't be stupid & good luck.|`|AA11313161	dump him then!|`|AA12063527	Good for her that she was cool with you!  Most girls would say a few bad words and hang up.  I wouldn't believe him.  If his intentions were to set her up with his buddy, he would have told you about it...or at least not freak out on you about it.  Sounds like he has a guilty conscious to me!  And he must have given you prior reason not to trust him to cause you to check his phone.  If I were you I'd get out before it got any worse.|`|AA11283922	he is cheating on you so leave him.|`|AA11310070	You should stay with him for a bit longer, any small thing that he has to do with her  should set you off, you should leave him if he speaks to her again in public, even if it is harsh, you should make sure he knows it.|`|AA12063577	Myspace huh ... sounds like a mature relationship !    I don't think it really matters ... he was talking to another girl.  I would trust your boyfriend until he gives you a reason not to.  If you go around accusing him of cheating all the time then he'll start thinking you don't trust him & there's no reason why you should be with somebody you don't trust !    If these things happen again I would sit down and talk to him about the future of your relationship sounds pretty rocky !|`|AA11825912	Yes you do already know you don't believe him.  You wouldn't be posting this question if you believed him.  Everything within you is telling you he's lying, isn't it? That's because he is.  No man would call a woman late at night to try and hook her up with his buddy.  I find it more insulting that he would come up with such a lame statement as that than him actually cheating.      I keep hearing about this "my space" perhaps it's a place you younger people hang out, at anyrate it seems to me to be nothing more than an online pick up spot.  The fact that he's hanging out there in the first place is suspect.  You just caught your boyfriend trying to cheat on you, and though he didn't actually do it this time, i'm sure it's not the first time it's occured.  You have to ask yourself what you believe and what you want to happen next.  If you stay with him there is a very real possibility that he will cheat on you again.    Also, you had no right to go into his cell phone, no matter what.  How would you like it if he would have done that to you?  If you have to check up on him then perhaps you shouldn't be with him.|`|AA11217560	HMM MAMI I THINK HES DOIN DIRT CUZ NO MAN GETS ON MYSPACE TO "HOOK UP HIS FRIENDS" I KNO I DONT THATS JUS MY OPINION|`|AA12256561	Investigate more, if he lying dump him. ask him who is he trying to fix her up with. Its weird to have that girls number in his cell phone i mean COME ON|`|d2febfc73f57ada31f54a89fd151b20caa	Find out the guys name she was going to meet from myspace. If its his friend then he was telling you the truth.|`|AA11132313	Move on..He was caught!!!!!|`|AA11375286	I think it`s a lie to he got mad because you found out.He is doing something and it dosent take einstein to figure that out. If I were you I would stay distant god knows what he could come back and give you.|`|AA11896681	he was caught red-handed...he knows it and you know it too. dump him|`|AA10696203	thats totally bull sh*t. i had to go throu the exact same thing except that  i dont even seen his phone.|`|AA12214505	If a boyfriend is "meeting" other girls in any space---MYSPACE, or otherwise---and making other girls believe he is single, then it's time to "MAKE IT SO, NUMBER ONE."    If he is not going to be faithful and honor whatever commitment you too understand exists in your relationship, then it's time to kick him to the curb.  Cheaters, liars, and manipulators make the choice to cheat, lie, and manipulate.  You need to make the choice whether or not you want to be cheated on, lied to, and manipulated.  That's you choice.|`|c7547922d63c18191a40c081a9390507aa	I wouldnt believe him. Guys usually dont get pissed if they have nothing to hide.|`|AA12289181	DUMP HIM he's probably been cheating on u da whole time...no tellin how many gurls he met B4 and sumthin happened if u know wat i meen|`|AA12034039	forget about him...its time to call me...|`|AA11947574	get rid of him he lied|`|AA12316522	did he tell you which friend?  do you trust him?  you know the truth - its in your heart.|`|AA12157664	He's a liar. His anger and flipping things around on you are admissions af GUILT! He took the focus off of his lies by getting mad at you. He's trying to hook up. My young friend just went through this with her man. Good luck.|`|AA12355184	if i was u i wouldnt believe him cuz even though he said he was doing his friend a favor by hooking him up wit somebody he swears his friend doesnt have a mouth to hook himself up wit somebody and he should b worried bout himself and how ur feeling about this instead of trying to help out his friend=)|`|AA11685403	you obviously don't trust him already, for some other reason, that prompted you to check his phone... so, i'd say the trust is gone, so is the chance of this relationship succeeding|`|AA11276194	hey thats your call leave him or take it, its your judgement but i think its time to move on.|`|AA11961877	Well us ladies have this thing to where we need to check behind these men/boys that we call our selves liking or loving. A women only look and check a man things when she feels he's not honest, faithful and she don't trust him.           I feel like if you don't trust him and you haven't trust him before now then look out for yourself get you someone on the side. you said you ask him about it and he gotten mad that's BS if! it's nothing  why would he get mad so what you looked in his phone what women don't go check and look no matter what it is.  And if he was so much trying to hook her up with a friend why couldn't he speak on it? Men think that they can do things and get away with it but little do they know there game is wick, they can lie and they can't hide nothing they tell on themselves just by their look . Sweetie look out for your self F*@  this men they an ****. Them and there got dam baby mama's.............................  pppppsssssssss **** Lisa & Mike
AA12393872	Dear- people are complicated. You will find the older you get-especially when it comes to be too complicated--there is really no gender difference who is more than the other. If you are talking specifically about in a relationship--maybe you need to find someone who does what he says. Honesty is the first and most important building block in every relationship!|`|AA11952283	Because they're confused.And because some women allow them to get away with some of the dumb **** they be doing so when they move on to the next one they think that one is suppose to deal with the bull to.Stop looking for guys and find yourself a MAN!|`|6c5e7a398fc27d904bf11639b9668b97aa	They have nothing better to do. Guys are in there own fantasy world. Its natural and it will be that way for life. They dont have periods to deal with or pregnancy or ne girl things so they have to have something to occupy there time.Right?|`|3a2683fef0f3806476f939b40fb20d62aa	Becoz they get confused understanding women
AA12083470	You need to make up your mind if you want to be a nun or not.  If you feel really strong about becoming a nun, then tell him.  If not, tell him your not having any sexually relations with him until you two are married.  If he doesn't like it, then he doesn't really love you and you don't need him anyway.|`|545f17438d3adba9d887e58641fb63ecaa	yes you should|`|AA12199157	u shoulndt become a nun|`|AA12316522	wait till your situation normalizes - right now you guys are not actually having a relationship together - it is long distance and that may have a major affect on your feelings - make a list of reasons why you want to be a nun and why you want to be with this man and why you dont want to be a nun and then put them away for a few days - then go back to them and read them and see how you feel reading these comments back to yourself.  hope this helps.|`|AA12345487	ummm, yes- no guy wants to find out his GF isn't interested in sex, plus, he's over there thinking of you.... he needs to know, just hope he takes it well and understands|`|AA12379028	Yes. This will end your relationship and it is only fair to tell him.|`|AA12246661	if u want sex, come 2 me.. but don't become a nun.|`|eac567cd596099d06ef876bf1c2fa46baa	yeah, you need to say something!! if he comes back from there and is planning on getting some and your a nun....not to be mean but expect the worsted OK.|`|AA11304071	it sounds like u dont really want to be a nun. if u were sure about ur decision u would have told him. its really gonna put unecessary pressure on the 2 of u if u tell him "if we dont get married, im becoming a nun".  so my advice is figure out if u really want to become a nun but don't base it on "only if u dont get married". if u dont want to have sex until marriage talk to him about it tell him your feelings about this sudden change of mind... maybe he'll understand.
AA11648818	100%|`|AA12070245	nothing is definite, but i think if you look back in history you will see that divorce is less prevelent.  because back in the days we had morals.  now we just **** like rabbits.      your relationship will grow closer together and you will understand your partners personality alot deeper.  the con is you will get horny and end up rubbing your meat raw, haha.      i dont know that but well im sure it will take a toll  and tempt you to cheat but i assure you waiting and then having the honeymoon suite with the first sex of your partnership will be that much better and more meaningful.|`|AA12192055	if their nature calls for not having sex, why not..|`|AA11172222	I would not be able to give u an exact percentage of what I think the chances are they will get a divorce, but I would estimate they would probably be maybe 20% less likely to get a divorce.  Of course that percentage could drmatically increae if neither partner had ever had sex. Can't be hung up about what might've been or could be a better lover if you don't know what's out there right?  I think it is worth holding out, but only biblically speaking. Since marriage is a religous institution (not speaking legally of course), it would be better to wait since that is what religion dictates.    The pros of waiting in my opinion are:  1. There being an extra feeling of closeness when the moment arrives.  2. Better and longer lasting appreciation for sex &  3. If they both are virgins, only they have that bond and will be more like to hold on to it.    and the cons:  1. You don't know what sexual relationship u r getting into until it's too late, that can be a bad bad thing.    Best I can come up with for now. Hope this helps.|`|AA10766815	the will eventually divorce....................|`|AA10912968	A lot of people bury their heads in the sand about this issue.  The truth is that sex is very important for the survival of a relationship.  If a relationship is sexless, either one or both parties are getting their "freak on" elsewhere.  They may choose to stay together for other reasons like children, finance and security.  I think that no sex will eventually lead to an "emotional" divorce.  A legal divorce will depend on other factors.    Is it worth it holding out until marriage?  For me personally it is not.  If my partner is bad in bed, I need to know this before I marry him, because if I find out after the fact, I will most probably cheat.
49bcfa78f8b5a2adb50925dfc93c8049aa	Be his friend first. After your friendship grows, if he's nice, ask him : " Hey, let's say you have a friend, and she has a crush on you, what would you do?" If he says something nice like"nothing", then tell him.  Good Luck|`|AA12393872	Go tell him and see how he reacts to it. It sounds to me that you may be younger than him. He should not be mad at you-embarrased maybe-- as you already are. The best policy in life to follow is honesty--and it will make you feel better if you tell him instead of wishing you did. If he turns you down- that is ok too because now he knows that you find him special and not just another boy. This could be good for the future as he will remember this kind of attention you gave him.|`|AA11619760	First off, are you sure that you truly LOVE him, or is it merely a crush/lust?|`|702c1ad4a142bf0b68e4bde5fd885c5caa	it doesnt matter|`|AA11553241	you don't. too young|`|033ec456265d08de7e7759eb48331ef8aa	trust me its not love|`|9384d08d9b600394d77da6bf53b6f22caa	What do all people do when they love someone- of course...they get together.

AA11693476	with the right person..it will make you a better person..definitelyl!!|`|AA10273189	Sounds like true love...of course it can....it heightens your sensibility and allows you to appreciate and enjoy life to the fullest...that's why its so hard to find.|`|4a9b3d4543efd4bdcd1563c7de7cb84daa	i think it helps you to be more in sync with yourself!|`|AA10287879	prove it to me and gimme ten points ;)|`|AA10529254	Yes being in love really makes you a better person not only for the one you love but everyone you come in contact with as well. Being in love and you know it's true is a very very wonderful thing theres nothing like it. Stay in love for as long as you can.|`|AA11310429	when your with the right person you do change hopefully for the better you will do stuff you normally wouldn't do you will think about that person day and night so yes you do change|`|AA12206782	I believe so. When you love someone, like you said, you want to be better for them. You want more than anything to see them smile or to hear them laugh, and if that means changing yourself for the better, then why not?|`|AA10871923	YOU JUST ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION. YOU SAID YOURSELF, THAT YOU ACT PROPER AROUND AND FOR HER. IT TENDS TO MAGNIFY YOUR BETTER QUALITIES, EVEN SOME YOU NEVER KNEW YOU HAD.|`|e9df8fec7a48401e8d622f7a1cad3a5daa	Yes it can.  The same thing happened to me.  My current girlfriend is truly a great person inside.  It has affected me and made me do stuff that before I wouldn't have thought twice about.
AA12242229	Then what's the problem??? I am not sure you really have one...he says he loves you...obviously opposites attract...you don't have to agree on everything...that's what makes a good relationship...|`|AA11576633	just talk to him about it not us|`|AA10695166	men can be like that,  get a good UNDERSTANDING MEN  book,or go to ivillage.com|`|AA11828119	The word is "are."  r is a letter.|`|AA11277680	let this be a lesson.....................|`|AA11310429	i was in your shoes not to long ago i was feeling like my husband didn't love me anymore after 7yrs of marriage but then i set him down and laid it all out how i felt what i was thinking and asked him to do the same and i asked him did he still love me and want to be with me but you have to be willing to except the truth and just not what you want to hear|`|AA11842527	well you to just might need a romance nite together to bring you to back to  each other OK|`|AA11274236	if you  are still sexual that is a good sign
90e35d49138d1b29ebd6b6f6bdec6a56aa	Girls do like nice men, but after a while it gets old. She needs you to be a bit of a challenge. You need to stop worshiping her and act as equals. It's obvious that you like her more, and that's not a good sign.|`|AA11608376	ok well im a girl and wouldnt do stupid shyt like that...honestly even i dont know why ppl say they want one thing and then want the opposite later she might jus not know excatly wat she wants in a relationship yet|`|AA11939205	Don't be confused, move on. She is playing both sides of the street, you may only be a temporary stop for her.|`|AA11494471	beacuse we are|`|AA12333753	She is playing games with you.  A real girl would have called you back and been honest with you.  Some girls play games and some girls don't.  You have to find one that will be serious with you.  Right now she is playing the field and she might leave you for someone else.  I suggest you play the field and don't give her too much of your time.  She may start wondering why your not giving her attention and that's when you hit her with the line" I cant be with someone who plays games"   Don't talk to her for a while.  If she truely wants you she will go out of her way to get you back.  And if she continues to play games repeat the process.  Three strikes and shes out

69ff2d7f2aba731af2ff61b7c331f16baa	Sweetie, my finace and I were only together for 3 months when we got engaged.  We are getting married next month, and only 5 months of being together and yet, I know this man's every move, every though.  I love him and he loves me.  So, if you feel you are doing this because you want to spend the rest of your life with her then by all means ask.  If you are only doing this to be with her then tis best not to ask.|`|dd479dba6e1b55e5264b83b0e92db845aa	Ask her!|`|AA12372916	ask her. 4 months is long enough if you know you love her. there are people who marry in Vegas on the first date!!!  good luck let us know|`|AA10888290	too soon|`|AA11635384	yeah it is too soon but what you could do is ask but explain to her you would like a long engament. Usually people are engaged a year or a year and a half before they actually get married. So sure ask then wait a while before you guys spend any money on plans.|`|ec3c18a23718cf55e9d3a36c6502e881aa	First  of  all   u   should   talk   to   her.   Don't   be   afraid.   It   is   just   so   simple.  Be   frank,    tell   her   about   your   feelings   &   your    fears.   Maybe     she  is    dreaming    about   making    a    family   with  you,  &   if   not   u'll   just     knew    what  is   she   feeling.   It   is    better  to   regret    what   has   done,    than    has  hasn't.|`|AA10766815	Too soon , true love takes time..............|`|AA11943241	I would suggest that you get to know her better and make sure she is the right one for you. Dont rush it and be sure when you do decide to ask her to marry you that she is the right one for you. If she truely loves you she will move with you when you do marry and that will happen then if she is really the one meant to be for you!|`|AA11841505	If you are questioning whether you should ask her then you probably already know the answer.  You are already in a long distance relationship.  If you move you will just be in a longer distance relationship.  If you are supposed to be with this girl you will be with her.  You do not need to rush into anything.  If you are questioning it now you will question it down the road.  I think you should allow your relationship more time to develop.|`|dfba8cf4ee3a0b1e97f205def95fce63aa	some people would need  40 years.. or more and you'd never get to love them, others need just a few days and you're already in love with them.  if you like each other that's the most important thing, just go for it, good luck to you both !|`|AA11579061	do you know shes the one??  if you feel it go for it...  i have been with a guy for 6 years and hes still not sure if he wants to marry me..   GOOD LUCK AND BEST WISHES...|`|6517968dd19444780cc6f6655217c74baa	You have not yet spent enough time together for you to pop the question.    You can, however, tell her how strongly you feel and that you would like to plan a future with her.      The rest will fall into place if it's meant to be.|`|AA11996816	Is it too soon? Only you can answer that question not me! You know her I don't! If she has spend the past 4 months and things are looking good than go for it!!

You do not need any ones advice we do not know you or her!!! Wish you all the best!
AA10887544	if ur above 20, then go ahead, but less than that, it will be hard for both of u... stay engaged and wait for the right time.|`|AA10784822	married her|`|AA11609865	yea sure. if u really love each other. go for it.|`|88c1bf4a8465d08773db86d35cc5b4c2aa	I wouldn't worry about what his mom thinks. My fiance's mother doesn't like me, and we are going to wed anyways. It's up to you, and him, and whether or not you are truly in love. If you are truly in love, follow your heart, and let nothing, and no one stop you from getting married if that's what you really want.
4686195ee2e42daaed30e4443f200bbdaa	I love to go on the fun dates...skating, bowling, mini golfing.... this way you have to carry on a conversation with the person... this gives you a chance to see what they are really like.  Going to movies keeps you silent...

AA11570347	Happened once and its been 10 years since the breakup.  Started dating again after 6 months, but looking back they were rebound relationships. I didn't meet someone else that I thought was the right one though.  I still think of him off and on, when something reminds me of him, but it stopped being sad memories after about a year.  If I could go back in time, I would have given myself a couple of years and at least some of that time not dating anyone so that I could just learn to be myself.  That's when you truly make yourself ready for the "right one."
AA12257113	For my six kids to be around me and tell me that they know I did the best I could for them.|`|26851bdc84fc23bf0793bc795b29c964aa	Most dad dont really care for materialistic items.  They actually are very sentimental.  You should give hime something to say that you really appreciate and love him.   Maybe a picture of you smiling with a message saying what you really feel about him.|`|AA11122778	Just to be with my kids.

18ec8a7640868c6ad5d7cefa642b351faa	The importance of family varies with each person.  It does provide a foundation for future relationships(all types).  Family helps shape and mold us into the adults we become.  We have to work hard to remove the negative affects and then work equally hard to share the positive with future generations in our family.|`|AA12358300	better than no family, carry out tradition.. and so on.|`|AA12275607	There is nothing like the unconditional love, just being yourself around them. I never knew it until I didn't have mine around me.|`|2a3c54ee643ea7461b9155be14282091aa	love, laugh, share, together|`|AA12301163	my family is my life|`|765b3d1099fd1b548ac06ad0f1aa80a9aa	llama
7f6639179056a28c0cdc8656874547d3aa	dude, when I was 26 I dated a 36 and 37 year old within a 6 month timeframe, and it was the best time I ever had.  unlike 25 year old girls, they were so much more comfortable with themselves, their sexuality, and what they want.  they didn't play games at all and they were so much fun to hang out with!    in terms of how to get them?  I didn't do anything special, I would say try not to be too eager.  you may want to approach them, but do it in an easy going style.  women in their mid to late thirties are entering their sexual prime like we were when we were 18 (im 34 now and married).    a women in her 30's is more interested in confidence, maturity, being layed back yet fun and having interests, and just being a nice guy . . . .. as opposed to a girl in her 20's who is more interested in looks, cockiness and whether the guy ismarriage material or not . . . good luck!|`|AA11312653	Ever since I've been about 30, I've preferred men 10-20 younger than me. It was really difficult to meet men in that age group by more traditional means, so I turned to personal ads.     Perhaps you might contact appealing women and point out to them that while men their own age might try to impress them by acting "youthful" and silly, you will try to impress them by acting mature, thoughtful and courteous. Of course, you will also have to convince them that you aren't a gold digger or gigolo wannabe.|`|AA11096766	Kudos for you finding an older woman to date.  But they are at the point in their life where they want NO drama, and they want someone to provide for them.  If they haven't been married previously, then they are still living the wild-life.  Those are the hard ones to get.  It's the divorcees that should be your target!|`|e2f7d093e32a27de479a5991c275033daa	Cause your not looking in the wrong place.  First you do understand that 75 % of 35 year old woman have kids right? Just want to let you know what your getting in to.  You are young and older woman sometimes see man that young as just above jail bait.  and most woman like older man.

c397e241a2d5d3799163771f34103cdeaa	Okay, how about you stop worrying about what he wants?  What about what you want?  How old are you?  Have you even had a chance to experience life?  It really sounds like he doesn't know if he wants to be with you or not but is going to continue stringing you along until he can make up his mind.  What are you going to do if he comes home, gets you pregnant and then decides he's not ready to be a husband and father?  Where does that leave you?  Can you be absolutely sure that he will not do that?  If the answer is no, then maybe you need to tell him that you need things to slow down. You don't have to let him call all the shots.  You are a person as well.  You have a right to decide, for yourself, what you want out of this life. There is much more to experience in life than being someones girlfriend/wife/mother.  Don't get me wrong, I am married and have a beautiful little boy, but I experienced life for myself before I did so. And we were married 7 years before I got pregnant so we could experience life together.  I wish you luck and hope you make the right decision for you!|`|AA11850471	U need to be firm with him...U have to make a decision of what YOU want...then if its the same u two can be together...if not  then u know u should move on.|`|AA12010981	Ask him exactly hat you just asked here!|`|AA11899189	Maybe know that he was leaving he thought he could find some thing better and he realized that ther's no one better than you so he's going back on his original plan|`|AA11543189	tell him to stop playing games with you because having a family is a seriuos thing you can't one day say let's not be serious then have a bay and think that's going to make everything better|`|35b426ef4a3e21311d48ca5b6ac491fcaa	OK, your boy friend is fickel. He may never make up his mind. You just have to wait and see if he makes up his mind. Stop pressuring him, if you are. Just don't bring up the subjuct for a while and see what happens. I also agree with SEXZBICH. Could be the answer.|`|AA12143452	get a life and stop worrying|`|AA11146268	he is scared and confused you two should have a really long serious talk in person not on the phone and try to be as honest as both of you can|`|9405b7cd39fb49b37ed6c57b77316b81aa	im from louisiana and the things he is seeing there makes you think alot about what you have and what you dont
AA11280073	Your little girl's safety is your first concern. She is being mentally abused and she will learn about life and marriage by what she sees and hears. You have to get out of this situation right away. You got married too fast. He is not the right guy for you or a good daddy for your little girl.|`|AA12256785	YES!!!!!You have doubts about that?Leave him. Your daughter should be way more important than his ***.She is your own flesh and blood for God's sake!|`|9584987b52a0289242901566a0e4d120aa	First off GET OUT NOW! Before an further damage is done to your daughter!!!! SERIOUSLY    You say he drinks, smokes and does drugs and has a bad temper, how do you know some day he won't physically (sexually ) abuse your daughter one day?      You moved really fast with him, now move really fast to save your daughters innocence and by that I mean, her love for life and her thought that all people are good, kids lose that earlier and earlier because of people like him and moms that don't care to protect their children.  I came from a dysfunctional family and I am still recovering from the affects 27 years later!|`|35b426ef4a3e21311d48ca5b6ac491fcaa	Get rid of him fast! He sucks. Your daughter should not have to suffer at your exspence. She will never forgive you for choosing to stay with him and let him abuse her, instead of finding her a loving father figure. Blood is thicker than water!|`|48b4de56d81548dbfc6e8936973ab3bdaa	Leave him! Omg, he might start to beat you and/or your children. Leave him immediately before this abuse gets worse.|`|14ef90c45c56ed0da7e09f4e001cba4eaa	First of all, I feel sorry for you and for those children.  You and every bodies in your house does not deserve to be treated that way.  I hope , he does not become more violent.  well, there is enough indication that he may have some type of mental condition .  You really need a very professional help in order to keep you and your kids safe.    Definitely ,they don,t need to leave under any fear- Is not good for their health.    I,m going to pray for you and your children  as well for him to be in peace and to have a very normal life as soon as possible.    -PLEASE TRY TO CONSULT WITH SOME ONE FROM YOUR FAMILY FROM WHICH YOU CAN GET THE BEST ADVICE WITHOUT PUTING NEITHER OF YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN IN MORE TROUBLE.                           from there you can decide what you should do.|`|a92f0e54792aa8451e3c50adfc7232eeaa	Try counseling first. If he will not go to counseling or do anything to improve your situation, then yes, leave him. Your daughter is at a very impressionable age. Things he does and says now might effect her for a long time to come. If he calls her fat, she may have an eating disorder later in life because she will always think she is fat. As her mom, it is your responsibility to provide a safe and secure environment for her, it doesn't sound like she's getting it while you are with him.|`|AA12246603	yo....leave him...thats the last thing u need is a abusive husband and father....even if it is verbal right now....i mean u really never know who or what ur dealing with yano?
2abab9f3bd32bd8d605b9a0ec58f4551aa	ah NO never,don't do it somebody is goin to end up in some big trouble find somebody that is your own age bad things can happen if you don't watch out because 23 year old people can not handle 15 year olds because they are way to young don't take this in a bad way!|`|AA11367858	yes whay not love is in the heart|`|AA12223390	How does a 15 year old even know what love is-people a lot older than that don't know what love is!!!!!!!|`|a62e7bc800502639386a194fc74c83aaaa	Puppy love........geez.......call it animal instinct.......geez.|`|3e15c746b774e2442deaf78d252860d5aa	Its called he is a child molester and she is in heat!|`|AA12017321	Love?!

AA11310858	Now is your chance to surprise her.  Before she gets home sprinkle Hershey Kisses in a pathway leading to the bathroom.  In the shower, hang a bouquet of flowers for her.  Tape a note to the mirror that reads.  "Because I love you so much, I have kissed the ground you walked on and showered you with flowers."  She will follow the path of kisses to figure out what the heck is going on.  Once she figures it out, it will definitely make her smile.|`|AA12304297	flowers tell her how much you missed her and that i know i would want to hear that my boyfriend missed me if i went away, and if i had a boyfriend to miss me.|`|c3056e264af3caaf78e093e9b34f0b60aa	i would go to a decoration store and get signs and ballons saying welcome back and kiss her a lot!!!!!!!!!!!! she will feel loved and appreciated and know she isnt invisible and know you were thinking about her and care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6657ddbfd244bd7d724b2cfd30cc1996aa	to better answer yr question visit>>>|`|AA11427901	Good question. It depends on how much you miss her. If you miss her a lot, then do something special. If you miss her, but not at the point that you're going to explode, then just do something normal. Either way, she'll be happy.|`|AA11939205	if she was only gone for a week or so, just go to dinner and catch up. if it's longer than that, it depends on what your girl likes..|`|e5396816bfb3621440889b7272bbf91eaa	You should do something romantic because she hasn't home with you in a long time and you could remind her how much you love her by surprising her when she gets back|`|AA11713194	well you might want to plan something to show her you've missed her...something for just the two of you....Good luck!!
AA12291390	talk to your friend and let her know how you feel. and as far as the sex thing... you already said the answer to that, your too young.|`|01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	You seem flattered that this "friend" thinks you are hot!  Does he think you have character,  a "fine" person with an intelligent mind?  Does he think you are trustworthy?  Does this friend think he can flatter you into bed?  Love involves respect and it doesn't seem to fit into this picture.  I would guess you are around 12 years of age or younger.  Take time to mature and I'd send this "friend" out to pasture.|`|AA10580190	You should not have sex with anyone until you get married. If he insists that you do,tell him to just back off because he ain't that special. Your friend may need to know about this guy,if the guy is supposed to be with her. You both should just try to be friends and that's it!!!!
aba7826e1834c7df991cf74b70af7b44aa	Okay...you call her your "best friend". I know that my best friend would never interfere with my relationship. Does she for sure like him? Because that is really low of her. And if you are nervous about them doing anything, it sounds like you dont fully trust your boyfriend either. Am I right? A good friend and a good boyfriend should both love and respect you. And you shouldn't worry that you wont be friends with her anymore, because a TRUE "best" friend will stick with ya forever. I think you need to question your friendships and relationships. Ask yourself these questions...    *Do she and my boyfriend flirt?  *Does he have a better time hanging out with you when she is there?  *Does your friend talk about him more than she should and wants to hang out with him a lot?  *How long have I known this girl?  *What have we fought about in the past?    Good luck to ya...Really you should just step back and examine your relationships. YOu could realize that these people are not who you think they are.|`|AA10509126	You're in a "sticky" situation.  Obviously there isn't really enough trust there because you are questioning some issues.  If there isn't trust in a relationship (any relationship - friend or bf) - then there's something very wrong.   You don't trust either of them.....think about why that is.|`|AA11111052	If my friend was "moping" around whenever I talked about my man, and it was a serious relationship, I would tell my friend to hit the road.  I would also talk to my boyfriend about it and explain the reasoning behind it.|`|AA11966357	Hey!  I think you should talk to her. She is your bff. Tell her straight  forward on how you feel. Tell her she probably wouldn't like it if she was in your shoes.(in your position). She should understand,...shes your bff.

AA11939205	only you can answer this question...it seems like he's respecting your decision to stay a virgin though, so maybe he really does care for you!|`|8b3668d19e31088bc29e9f6289da8362aa	First... Why the "but I'm still a virgin"?  That is a wonderful thing, and if he ain't jumping from the rafters about marrying a woman who still has her virginity, then you need to move on.    I found a woman that I want to marry and she is a virgin!  I'm excited cause I'm getting someone who hasn't been used by someone else! (and I mean this in a very very good way)  I wanted a woman with the morals to not go sleeping around.    As for the relationship, "on and off" isn't a relationship.  If you want to be married, you need to maintain a relationship for at least a year before discussing marriage.  "On and Off" leads to divorce.|`|d98bf427e3c4df9798f6e52c44d11cd5aa	if you thank he really loves you you should but if you dont thank he loves you should not  love him|`|AA12266251	dump him he is gay

In respect of their gender they are also taught how to respect and treat the male gender.  It is part of their culture and it works.  Before you say anything the opposite is true also that the men are raised and educated on respect for the female gender.  Love and respect in a culture is a beautiful thing and I for one hope they are able to preserve it for a long time.  It might be one of the last cultures that teaches the finer things between men and women.
AA10867415	It appears your BF's family are using his feeling of responsibility to be at their beck and call. Out of his mom, sister and brother there should be one person who can take over, though I am not sure of the ages here. I would help set up the family to handle their own problems and perhaps implement government agencies who can help in some families. You have not said why they need him or how they coped before he got back but I think he needs to put you first but make sure his family has the means to get on with life without him.

If you just want to ask her on a date, then just ask her to go on a "business dinner."  Once there, order a bottle of wine so that the evening will be more relaxed.  Talk about business for a bit, but then switch to more personal topics.  If it goes good, then you can ask her out again...this time as a real date.  Tell her "I had a really good time with you the other night, would you like to go to _____" (a sporting event, or something more casual then dinner is a good idea.)  And there ya go, instant love!! :-)   I hope this helps!!!
AA10790677	Talk! Tell her that she looks pretty. A compliment does not cost a thing, but ladies love to hear them, even if it's a soft little wolf whistle (don't make a spectacle out of it). Ask her what she wants to do, and if it's a chick flick, go and try not to fall asleep.  Take her on a picnic to a pretty place that you know of near your home.      Before you leave her, (make sure your breath is good for this one) lean close to her ear, and whisper softly, "I can't wait until I see you later."  I don't know about all women but I have heard a LOT of women say they love it when their man whispers sweet things in their ear.  Slip little love notes into her purse when she is not looking or bring her a flower once in awhile.

Leave her note as simple as "Just wanted to make you smile today". Always be yourself, no use pretending.

Get out go for a walk breath the fresh air.  Call a friend or two, maybe a counselor. I often feel that way for various reasons.  Try to focus on the positive blessings you have. To realize how SPECIAL you are and there is absolutely no one in this world like you. Life will often be unfair or unjust.  Other times tragedies will happen when we least expect it and turn your life upside down.  Never mind the day-to-day struggles.    I have gone to my practice of embracing the difficult times as much as I do the wonderful ones.  When you get comfortable with working through the difficult times...making decisions, finding solutions, concentrating on the positive things in your life, realizing your qualities/limitations, counting your blessings...the wonderful times will overshadow the struggles and as one door closes another will open with new and better experiences.|`|AA12036524	WHAT'S WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO YOU NEED TO SEE A THEROPIST|`|AA10258666	Well why does your heart hurt did you just break up with someone or what?..........Maybe we can help you more if you be a little more specific.|`|AA11595754	wished u wud have been more clear.. no problem anyways.  when a heart hurts its the most difficult feeling,but friend try to luv yourself, do things u love doing,i know you must be having hell lot of emotional burden on you, ease it by talking to yourself,or ur close buddy, u'll surely get thru...  promise yourself that u'll make ur life worth living'and honey show the world that ur special.. because you really are special, trust me u'll get thru this and will say urself that i have the ability to heal my heart...take care!!!|`|a7ddf9b8528b7b72538d3a48789ae4c7aa	e-mail me, we can chat    standardwhiteguy@yahoo.com|`|8e18ca621540de8dc22d0eae935da6c3aa	kill the cause of your hurts, be happy , good for health u will live long.|`|94d0cd70a1f72bbfeff46fb31dcefee2aa	get some help or go to the docotrs

AA12039576	Yes you can get an STD even if you use a condom. Although it does help minimizes your risk of getting infected it isnt 100% at preventing it.

c0f3f74bcaa5c22b07bd6f99011373bcaa	There is no actual way of "making someone like you" either as a friend or something else, if you are interested in someone, you should just really (and this will sound cliche but still) be yourself, just let him know how you are and if he is attracted to how you are it will work out, of course you could start by showing him the aspects of yourself you think he could like the best    the next thing you could to do is actually build a relationship, even if it is not a romantic one, share things, experiences, moments, so that you get to know more of each other and see how you "work together"    and then the tricky part, tell him how you feel, not necessarily out loud because that might scare him, i mean, avoid "i love you" or "you are the hottest most amazing person i have ever met and i want us to marry and have kids" , you can start by telling him you like him very much and how there could be really "something" between you two and it would be amazing if you could try and see what happens    of course, a little bit of sexiness could help too, just never go out of your way or attempt to be someone you are not, you can show a bra strap, wave your hair, wear a skirt and let him sneak a peek like you didnt want him to, and get angry if its obvious he did, use small accessories he could "borrow against your will", get close enough to him so he can recognize the smell of your hair, etc.|`|AA11426971	change your avatars face for 1 thing.....uuuhg I gonna puke!!|`|5869aa101b7c2875bffead08f5736eb3aa	omg! i have no idea! im in the same situation as you! i like a boy and want him to like me back in the same way! i have no sugestions sorry! :(    but good luck!!|`|d9da0bc2fc7627da270f1ab9fd507afaaa	I don't know....but when u find out tell me please lol|`|53083f8951cf982ea29c264cb7112422aa	be naked and give him a can of beer|`|53b903c8ca5ffc54c44f96d31a6c9927aa	Give him great oral sex (and swallowing couldn't hurt either)!|`|4cfce953577dcdfe77eeb3faaa50b0f0aa	Pleaseee himmm.. no just kidding.. be yourself.. approach.. let him know how you feel, then lets see what happen.. rather keeping quiet and questioning yourself, "he loves me, he loves me not".. face him.. talk to him.. some ppl loves the directness, some don't.. you choose..

I will come back so please list your and his age.    Basically let him see you as a more sexy girl. Most guys are dumb where it comes to signs...    But skimpier clothes may help, being more flirty. Waring tops that draw maore attention to your chest etc may help... If young dont push things too far.  Activities that encourage touching ie you 'forgot' how to play say pool and need a hand (ie arms around you) .    Also guys may be nervous to get too close as thinking you may call him perve and not want to know him... Some act in a way that lets him know its ok... Ie get into tickle fights or play wrestle ie girls can out wrestly guys and cheat if necessary to encourage him not to hold back... that way you get all grapply.    'Forget you are wearing a short skirt when you climb the ladder or tree with him.    Then later casually say when he is drinking ask him if he liked the view and watch him squirm and deny it, probably choke on his drink like a kid caught with hand in cookie jar.    Likwwise if he is noticing your boobs... Then laugh about it.    etc    Go to the cinema and put your arm around him and snuggle into him or if he nervously puts arm around you move it to your boob and move into kiss him...    This is aimed at the 14-17 age group with some suggestions ie the short skirt one more for 17.    17-9+ accidently o purpose get changed somewhere he can peak, trying and failing miserable to be a gentle man as you undress say door is agar as not shut proprly and mirror conveininetly placed... That would requre some practic so you pretend not to notice him looking and checking you out.      Then like the star at boobs or see up you skirt thing bring it up casually a while later when on his own and he thought he got away with it...    Thats a 17+ suggestion...

I think it is for control especially when they get married the guy will think his wife will have to be like his mother.  Then the wife will be driven insane and feel like she has to compete with her mother-in-law for her husband.

AA11276475	There comes a time in many relationships that it is important to worry about YOU, not 'you all.' If you are unhappy, chances are that he is also, and wants to end it as you do...but he is in the same boat..."I don't want to hurt her." You leave by saying, "I am unhappy and this is not working for ME." Please do not second guess his reactions...he may be relieved that he didn't have to "hurt" you. In situations like these, honesty is usually the best policy, there is no way to soft soap the issues, and nothing short of " It is time to end it and go our own ways" will do. DO NOT tell him anything like I usually see: " You can do so much better," "You will find someone you are looking for, " etc.   This is all nonsense. Just tell him "bye." Short, to the point, and walk. There is no reason NOT to remain friends, but lovers??? I suspect you are both in the same boat. Since he doesn't have the nerve, do it for him. He will thank you in one way or another. You really do not have a problem other than 2nd guessing him.

If you love him and vise-versa, you both should be able to talk about how you both feel about this & what expectations there are. Be stern about your feelings and let him know that you can't continue with this relationship if there is no trust and honesty. Let him know you are there for him, but he can't hold things back like this. If this is something you feel you cannot accept, let him know. If you can look past this and you both truely love each other, you'll work things out. I know plenty of couples were this has happened to them. Most found ways to work things out, but you have to have an open mind and have a strong, genuine love for each other. What ever you do, don't blame yourself.|`|AA11791594	First, he was definitely wrong for lying(by omission) to you about for 2yrs! He can say it's because he didn't know or wasn't sure but believe me, you know when you're attracted to the same sex. It was probably difficult for him to accept at first. Maybe he had to make his peace with it before telling you. Second, a person can be bisexual and still be monogamous. Being bisexual doesn't necessarily turn you into a cheater or a 'player'-It simply means that you are attracted to both males and females. But you can love the one you're with and be faithful to that person. If he's willing to be with only you, then you have no problem. It all depends on the qualities(values,morals) an individual has.You should have an open and totally honest discussion with him. Since he's lied to you for two years though, it would be difficult to trust him at this point. I think this is something you share at the beginning of a relationship-when you know it's starting to get serious. If you like you can email me and I'll tell you more in detail. Listen to your head on this one more so than your heart and I hope you realize how important protection is. I hope things work out for the best although the best may not be exactly what you want. Good luck.|`|b5bd8141aa4cfb70f3733718c460b6fbaa	U can take no one advice but you own you should follow your heart and it will lead you in the right path. If you feel you really love him than stay with him. But take a minute and think about what ya doing. Only you and god know so follow your heart. Maybe god put this in your way so you can find you true love. Be aware that most things happen for a reason. Need to talk more my email adress is crishellbrown@yahoo.com

I'm 5'3 and my boyfriend is 6'6, which isn't much a difference than you and your girlfriend. People don't look at us funny. Maybe you're overreacting. But being 6'7, people are going to look at you whether you're with your girlfriend or not, just because tall people are intriguing. Hope this helps.|`|8444d9c308d88bd8165ccf8120cdb1a5aa	I think, as long as people love each other who cares what you look like or how tall you are.  It is neither of your faults that you grew up to be the height you are.

No great lost.|`|5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	Sometimes it can be hard to deal with, especially if you two were close and dated a long time. You can spend more time with your family and friends and try doing things that don't remind you of him. If you two went to a particular mall or movie theater together, try going to different ones. Eventually it'll get easier and you'll meet someone else. In the mean time try to find something else to pass your time. Hope this helps.|`|23ab1e3f042a8b92386a3fc3c0dae1d4aa	Be more meticulous with the next one to make sure that he is really serious. Learn from this relationship apply it to the next one.  You still like him? Try hanging with your friends or family.|`|AA10780214	Well, I think that you need to breathe deeply and relax. You should really just calm down and get the emotions to exit your mind. If you can do this you can focus on what went on leading up to this break-up. You should also be honest in what was your part in the situation as well as knowing what was you ex's part. Accept what is yours and don't take in the remainder, be honest. Once you have looked it over and evaluated things that you can learn from this experience GET OVER IT and put it behind you. Much easier said then done, I know as I have been there many times in my 37 years of life. I can tell you the really empowering point is when you turn the corner taking what you have learned, armed with this knowledge get back in the game. Life does have it bumps and detours and it is how we react to them that really frame's up who we are..... I am sorry to hear about your breakup. I hope that you can get through it and come out from it a much better person!!!!|`|AA11896074	well if it was me i would hook up with another lad pronto and show him wat he is missing.that should do the job if it doesnt work get over it and move on ,plenty more fish in the sea.|`|AA12108875	Girls have themselves to blame for having hooked up with a jerk. There is no reason for a girl to hook up with jerks. Some girls are masachists. They like to be inflicted with pain and hook up with guys that are going to walk out on them sooner rather than later. Wake up girl. Learn from your mistake. Don't go out with every boy that wants to go out with you. Go out only with guys who are worthy of you.|`|AA11640665	Spend time with your friends and understand you are not the only person who has gotten dumped before.  I believe that your true love will come when you are least expecting it, so enjoy your life with your friends and understand that he wasn't worthy.
AA10134625	Time to change your focus grasshopper...    Life is funny and unpredictable, sometimes cruel and cold, sometimes so warm and wonderful you actually spill tears of joy!    Now really, is this the last girl on the planet? No of course not. Can you go to the movies by yourself? Yes, they are able to sell single tickets.  But don't go to the movie if you're gonna sit there and be depressed!!  Go bowling!  Ask a question about your favorite song on Answers!  Go buy some skates and learn to do what you were once able to do as a child!    Are ya sensing a pattern? Do something, anything that is fun and lighthearted!    The love of your life could be in the checkout lane, buying the same brand of cereal as you (personally I recommend Peanut Butter Capt Crunch).  You could both reach for the same book on a shelf at B&N or Borders.  She might be the person at the checkout counter of your local movie store who likes your choice in movies and says so, or you ask which is her favorite classic movie, listen, and she shares her world with you...    Go out there become who you are meant to be, find happiness in yourself, and get out there.    Unless you happen to have a female US Mail deliverer, not much chance the love of your life will appear on your doorstep.    Forget "this" particuilar girl, if she's interested she sure isn't acting like it.     You have worth and some wonderful woman out there will appreciate you!    Now go have fun, and let love surprise you! - J|`|AA10716277	Go by yourself.

AA11333317	Get married online. .  . .  without meeting each other.    I do not think that is possible!    You both need to be there for the wedding.|`|AA12270523	sorry but thats quite sad really|`|819c01a403b1669a80df163dba048980aa	This would not be legal because of the immigration laws. If you want to get to Canada, do it like normal people do and apply for immigrant status. Dont marry somebody just to get residency; they are v ery suspicious and keen now, and when they catch you they will deport you and jail your fellow conspirator.
AA12393872	I have found that truth and straight forwardness has always been the best policy. Tell him how you really feel, as in that you want to expand the relationship you have to a more intimate level.  Show him your exact intentions and, one way or the other, you will have a clear answer. Even though you may not like what he has to say about it, at least the questions of "what if" will no longer be. This will definitely define the boundaries of your relationship either as lovers or just close friends. This is a great way to make sure it is a lasting one with either result. Good luck dear!|`|38538424eaa73a372b1fed2a1b7281f2aa	You know my fillings about this young lady, so how do I put it so you would under stand. Place him off the friend list and place him on friends with benefits. You go girl. get you some. And it does sound like to kidding to me. I think both of you want it, and to scared to ask the other. So my point is don't wait for anything to happen, make it happen. Take the control and make it happen. and call him up and say "you like me, you want me, you want to ***** me, " and in a low voice "you could have me" like in a sandra bolluck voice.|`|c818aca1c686ed63bac6e5c8ede79d08aa	what these ppl said. but i think he wanna holla because he showed you da dick pic|`|AA11159199	Thats like me and one of my gf.....Just tell him you're serious and you want to hold him tight or something like that. Show him how much he means to you, Talk to your friend and tell your friend that you really want him..You should make a move before some one else does....Best of luck|`|AA10245338	You never know what he is thinking.  If you are thinking you're just friends, he may be thinking something different.  You need to ask him, and ask him several different times.    Guys often joke about liking someone when they're serious about them.  We often don't admit it right away.    But just because he's staring at your chest / hips doesn't always mean he likes you...it just means you're hot.    The  1 rule for knowing what a guy's thinking: ask him!  (The  2 rule: ask his friends, if he doesn't admit anything.)
AA11746917	I hate to sound so skeptical but anyone who believes the stuff they are told by another on the internet is just plain naive. People lie and misrepresent themselves on the internet 24/7. For all you know, the other person is a mass murderer. So, if it's bothering you, come clean. But don't be surprised if your friend is someone other than who you think they are.

AA11929109	I think he does like you...    Your friend might be saying that because he feels a bit threatened by this new guy, but I do reckon he likes you but he's not sure how to show you...    He pays "way too much" attention? Well...he's only doing that to you, isn't he? :-) if so...he likes you! If he does it to a few girls though, he might be a bit unsure of who he likes (ie he likes a few people) so be careful but if it's just you...I'd say he likes you! He just doesn't know how to say...but he's taking the chances, say, to touch you or put his arms around you...    I think, about the 1/2 asian remark...he likes that you're keen on Japan, and so he's trying to let you see that...like he's saying you're like him - if he prefers to date asians, then he's trying to "tell" himself you're basically 1/2 asian too!     Best thing would be to simply be honest...all you'll do is miss the chance if you don't :-)|`|aba7826e1834c7df991cf74b70af7b44aa	too long to read

Hope this helped a bit|`|38e8de892520c68f84530fe0b2c79731aa	well if you're in the same class...then just ask him about homework or something dumb like that. any excuse will do...once you break the ice the conversation will flow easily.|`|28dc92224264528445a0cad0b25c709faa	You start talking about sports or what ever you know he's into but you have to be in a group if he hears he'll totally what your  !|`|288553d463d09928dac754ed9313f2a1aa	Believe it or not, most guys absolutely love it when women initiate a relationship as well as kissing, holding hands, etc.|`|AA12013927	First you should know him more, his sports , his likes and specialy the thing that interest him most, then have an idea of it so in case you'll have a chance to talk to him then it will not be a boring conversation. men likes it when the girl knows  how to talk or how to bring the conversation on. And one thing is to be yourself , dont hide or pretend of someone elses, make him also interested in you. dont also show of everything about you, leave some for him a mystery.  You have to be sensible and with lots of humor.|`|ccf8cf12a0d52b7e4dcc07fdf3c67a7daa	Walk up and say hello.

AA11545874	Sometimes people dream about them who are very close to us and it is common in everyone. But if u dream about that peson frequently or miss him too much and remember him everytime then I guess u may be in love or a deep friendship with that guy but If u just see a dream of a person whom u were close to one time and now have no contact then it just means u remembered him in ur subconsious level and nothin much.|`|AA12360662	Basically, that does not mean anything but you have a sudden urge to remember a friend of yours.  That happens to our subconscious mind sometimes.  Why?  It could be triggered by something you saw, something someone says that reminded you in the day time and yet at night you got it projected in your memory.  It happens.
db8c36d555d48407c0074508486687ddaa	This, my dear,  is an early sign of an abusive man(boy). He is not the right kind of guy for you. You need to leave him alone and move on to the right kind of guy for you. Someone who will love you and treat you right. He is not a good man(boy) if he talks down to you. You need someone who will lift you up and not tear you down by telling you that you are good for nothing. You are good for something! You are good enough to be loved and cherished by a handsome and decent young man-- and it is not him. LEAVE HIM ALONE! NOW!!

d39a1459adc2309ffddda17f75e3dac3aa	My fiance's mother is the worst woman I've ever met in my life and I've only met her once, that was enough for me. I don't allow her in my house, my fiance goes there to visit her. The rules where the kids are concerned is that she's not allowed around them if she's rude about either myself or my fiance, and the first time she is he's to bring them home and she's on a "time out" from the kids. I find that they still love the rude members because they're used to it and have had to live with it. My family might not be made of gold but we have manners and we're nice so I'm not used the coldness. My mother always said, don't invite evil into your house and if they meet you somewhere else, leave!|`|2db0df7c982d3245d5205ff238c72163aa	they always say, you don't just marry a man - you marry his whole family...  try to make the best of it if you really love your husband, that is true commitment...  good luck to you sweetie!!!|`|AA11622808	I can relate with that. My ex in laws were always interfering in my marriage. Trouble is my ex husband agreed with everything they said. They were controlling our finances and our lives.   My ex husband was such a mummys boy it was not funny.  After 14 years of marriage I could not stand anymore , I got out.  I wish you well, I hope your husband stands up for you. But you have to stand your ground. You sound like a nice person, do not let them get to you........speak up.|`|AA10001315	This may sound stupid or trite - but tolerate them.  You don't have to go out of your way to avoid them, and you shouldn't, but when you can - do it.  Do not speak badly of them - do not criticize.  You might joke around, but be easy on them.  Remember they mean a lot to your husband.  They ARE his family.  What sort of person would he be if he took sides without someone against them?  What sort of person wold you be if you asked him to choose?    In-law problems can tear a marriage apart - and guess what - that means they get rid of you!  If you're committed to your marriage and your husband - do like a duck with water off her back.     My husband's parents are so wonderful - but his cousins, who unfortunately are our age, are such buttinskis and competitive and opinionated.  I try not to have an opinion around them or not to care about what they are discussing.  I've gotten so good at it that I can really tune them out.

421dcce2d04218899e188207a7cfb2adaa	I have a hysterectomy and at one time took a combination estrogen/testosterone but it did not help and just made my acne worst.  Often low sex drive is caused by a poor diet low in zinc and B vitamins.  A doctor can take a blood sample and analyze it for vitamin, thyroid and hormone levels.  If there is a deficiency found then you can work with your doctor or a nutritionist to remedy the problem.  Excess stress and/or depression is also a culprit.  Low sex drive can have a psychological aspect and it may help to have some short-term counseling to explore that possibility.   Just have hope and right now while you are figuring it out try not to stress.  Just focus on the positive aspects of your marriage and don't beat yourself up.|`|3d65fa879abd1ce93691268f923e0b5daa	Nothing that I know of... but I know that after taking Zantrex (I wanted to lose my last 5 lb and did) I have a great peak in energy I think due to the caffeine and a boost in that department.|`|195403be9b64ce997ff3909c06d7f195aa	Don't think so.

0260f9d315de8acdff74620525bb3065aa	I did something similar to that.  It was ways to communicate.  It was very effective; however, it takes time and alot of effort just as counseling would.  I would recommend both.|`|cd51d7dcbabdd845d7625ed08176280eaa	Marriage counseling -- First, it won't work if both of you aren't willing to give it a try.  If one of you walk in saying "I'm only here becasue THEY need it .." it won't work.  What happened to me was that my ex attended a few sessions, didn't really particiapte but insisted I was the one that needed the help.  So, he stopped going - I continued to go .. I later divorced him and I have been deliriously happy now in my second marriage with a man who isn't so self absorbed.  My ex?  Well, he's approaching 40 with no job and living at home with momma .... If you ask me -- I think I got more out of it than he did .. : )|`|AA11990068	A little of both.

It means, the first time they fool you, it's their fault.  The second time, however, you should have seen it coming.  Anyone that betrays you has some serious issues, possibly, that make them untrustworthy.  You might give them a benefit of a doubt, but I wouldn't turn my back on them... those knives are hard to get out of your back.  If you do decide to trust him/her, do so cautiously.  Trust has to be earned and this person has already broken your trust, so you can either cut ties or be a bit suspicious of them from now on to protect yourself.|`|623f6dc876447ab6172aeec6c490dfbdaa	you cant know. This person might be laying to you but at the same time he\she could be honest but every body deserve another chance .|`|f642d06a73bf889dcdaec515417c5b72aa	Yea it is possible that they will caz everytime sum1 lies or betrays u then ur buildin a wall which will make it even harder 4 them to make u believe them...it would be like "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"|`|05ca2f3a2c701cf79602a1703e5208e3aa	people do make mistakes, and I do belive people do change, I guess it depends on the situiation|`|AA11119646	One they cross that line there is no line anymore.   It becomes easier for them to do it again.  Although possible, I think it is rare for someone that has cheated once to only cheat once. I think most cheaters cheat more than once.
9f6eb8ff5ada98b20b1e39a76c2439e7aa	first of all i need to know what is the problem here? .  Is there anything in specific bothering you?.  Are you worrying about something in your life partticularly and maybe its stress that is happeneing to your body if you cant have sex for longer times.  UHm.  Or maybe you guys have been having sex very often and the "passion flame" just seems to fade away.  If you are having sex too often than the problem is variety.  YOu need to try new things and not go straight to the point.  have sex here and there but not every time you guys see each other.  Sex should not be a routine it should be an activity :) trust me|`|d539e0f005a399fb0b2ed8261bc154edaa	renew your relationship-always keep the infatuation alive if at all possible-try to surprise each other any way possible (and not just in the bedroom)-routine makes any situation more boring

But regarding what they knows, It depends on which person you're talking about. Everyone turns mature at different time.

965c21285ffeb7d18cbfd458d0f09492aa	Perhaps it isn't being lazy so much as perhaps being rebellious about certain things. Being stubborn jackasses doesn't help much either, but something has got to give sooner or later.    Women were expected to clean the house, cook the food, and raise the children, which was fine - half a century ago when men were out in the fields ten to twelve hours a day. Today, women expect to be treated no differently than their business counterparts. Certain people were raised according to different sets of rules. Some women expect men to open doors for them, lavish them with expensive gifts, and generally treat them like princesses, just like in medieval times. Women want the best of both worlds it seems, without wanting to accept the realistic consequences of what that may bring.    One might ask, why will women from my generation do anything (and I do mean ANYTHING) for money?|`|AA11603013	what generation would that be?|`|AA11115390	!|`|AA10116125	Which one? I think all guys are lazy, mine arn't men yet. But yes they are so lazy!
8e9596042210b5b4bf801141af420db1aa	That's like asking someone to read a crystal ball.  But, just because the relationship may not work out doesn't mean it will be because of cheating.  If you're worried about the other person cheating, then you're in the wrong relationship to begin with.  All relationships have to be built upon trust and then go from there.  I have had long-distance and out-of-state relationships and sadly, none of them have worked out.  However, I am a firm believer that if it is meant to be, it will work.  Just remember to be realistic and to not fantasize as to how perfect things will be no matter how far apart the two of you may live.  You can only be let down at that point.|`|AA12346641	It is completely up to you. Some men are better than others but when that has happened to me they normally cheated. It will be hard if it does work out. If he is an honest guy than you both should be fine, but who knows he may not be as honest as you think. Be careful please because I have been there and done that and it sucks.|`|8ea761c44d4ec6edfb7cec3f12d68492aa	I can only tell you what I would do.  If he is living in another city indefinitely, I would not count on things to work out.  If you will only be separated for a couple months - that's OK.  But if you will be apart for longer than that, there is no point in torturing yourself about whether he will cheat on you or not.  It's only natural for people to meet other people if they are separated.  I don't know whether he will cheat on you or not...the bigger question is do you really want that kind of separation?|`|49667b753475242e682c034ce6d5db5faa	how far apart are the cities?  You have to make an effort to see each other as much as you can.

I can tell you that it is working out good . I would not worry so much about living in different Cities. If you are going to have a relationship Weather it living close or far a part it must have trust if you don't have that you do need the relationship.|`|6db383bb3d25054e8464f945f36158f0aa	It doesn't matter where you are. I think if your relations don't last in different cities, they are not going to work out in the same city.|`|AA12072865	Its hard to say for sure right now its 50/50 it may work out and it may not|`|AA11010801	I dont think anybody can say weather or not he will cheat , but what i can say is go with the flow of things if its goin good so far just relax and enjoy it .... when things arent going so great come back and ask us some more questions  like  " HE'S  NOT ANSWERING the phone" OR  I FOUND PANTIES ON HIS FLOOR or I CHEATED WITH SOMEONE ELSE ..... until then just have fun and enjoy it.....

Good luck hun!!! Hope it works out for ya!!|`|AA12281702	Once you falsely accuse a man of anything,  you have ruined the relationship.  From now on be very sure your facts are straight before you do any accusing.  Usually when a woman falsely accuses a man of cheating it is to cover her own sins.

AA11629871	Yes, of course.  I believe most people do, or the human race would be extinct.  LOL!  As for positions, my favorite would have to be any position that involves her being on top of me.  I also enjoy missionary due to the intimacy, but find that generally, women get more pleasure out of being on top & I last longer.  For me, I get the most enjoyment out of causing a girl to climax, so positions that stimulate her more than me are important to me.  This is also the reason that I enjoy giving women oral sex if they are shaved, or at least neatly trimmed.  I figure I'm probably going to get mine in the end, so I really enjoy giving her hers as many times as possible, & I don't worry about getting off until she says she's getting too tired to continue.  Then, a little beat-the-clock in missionary usually does the trick for me, & gives her at least one more good send-off orgasm.|`|AA12261900	yes any position that involves me inside her and gets me off|`|AA10246912	hell yes... position u mean? doggy style... and i like girls who are into oral sex and the butt too and actually just very horny girls is cool|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	Duhhhhh......|`|AA11839147	everything and anything . . wots not to like!!|`|51ecb6ba7cb80d149cb0f2291cc0c06aaa	of course i enjoy sex, who doesnt.  my favorite position would have to be doggie style but im always up for trying new things and different positions.

a16d3feabfcfd14624bdfbfb29c04dabaa	What do you want to do?  Do you have feelings for him?  Do you want to be more than friends?  If so, you should tell him and see if he feels the same way.  He may be worried that you'll reject him so he hasn't said anything.     If he doesn't want to be more than friends then perhaps you can let it go, but having sex with someone almost always changes the nature of the friendship/relationship so it may be hard to act like nothing happened.    You might need to stop hanging out for a while.    As to whether or not its going to happen again -that is 100% up to you.  You have a choice in the matter.  Its your body, don't ever do anything you don't want to do.    If you think having a 'friend with benefits' is something that seems like a good idea....I'll tell you it will only lead to heartbreak for one or both of you.  It may work for a time, but eventually it will lead to a painful ending.   Just go into it with your eyes wide open.|`|AA10649406	he has already gotten past what happened and has decided its best to not let what happened get in the way of your friendship, because it probably means alot to him, if you want the friendship to remain intact then you should act the same as before but before doing so get out anything that needs to be said so you can clear the air of what is going on inside you and then work everything out from there, but he has already made the decision that he would like to remain friends so it may not happen again...|`|AA12175189	there is nothing that can be done. once you have crossed that line between friends and sex partners there is no turning around.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	If you have a flat tire on your car, you don't say, "I want to get rid of it." No, you fix the tire or have it fixed. Don't say anything about ending your relationship. Fix it.     If you are getting stale on your sex life, take time to be together, talk to each other. Reminisce about your young love. Go on a vacation. Maybe it will be just an overnight stay at a motel, but don't let your work bog you down. Companionship is important for a healthy marriage.     Start to save your marriage NOW. Don't look back and pick up the negative. Forget the sour times; don't remind the spouse of past faults.     Begin today to add sweetness in your married life. Be positive.     Why do you fight? All couples have disagreements. Talk over the difference and you will discover the argument was minor. Learn to be silent when you differ.     Don't let your grievances linger; get it over with. Don't have a fight before other people or your children. Never hit your mate. Be honest and understanding.     Jealousy has lead many a couple to the divorce court.    Show your companion respect and affection. As one person said, "Be sure it is your wife/husband you're in love with, not yourself." So many married couples love themselves more than they love their partner.     Every day say to her or him, "I love you." And put meaning from the heart into those words.    Hope this helps~|`|6750ac79c265476fddc15cbee2f3ea1faa	just be nice with her !!! if she really love u, the marriage will get better|`|AA11630345	Know God and always read ur bible.|`|8e35d8175973147f302b9c0a052067baaa	Be honest w/ everything, Be faithful, Respect the other, Love her/him and let her/him know that, Have fun w/ her/him, Be friends with ur couple......|`|6da36cbb1a2a23bb563da3eca10fe087aa	Listen, talk, and compromise.  These are the essential things that can save a relationship.      You both have to sit down and talk.  But before you start, both of you have to open your hearts and minds.  It must be your common aim to save your marriage so you can be more open to listening to what the other has to say and later on, come to a compromise.      Lay all the cards out, every piece and every detail.  Yes, you may argue about some issues, BUT, remember that both your aim is not to point a finger at the other or to put the blame on the other.  Your aim is to resolve all the issues that have driven you both into the situation that you are currently in.      Compromise.  Compromise is very crucial in the success of any kind of relationship. The only thing that bounds you both to each other is your love, and this love will soon die down if you don't work together in coming to a compromise.          Once you have threshed out all the issues, give yourselves a chance to rekindle the fire that once brought you two together, and keep that fire glowing with constant communication.  I firmly believe that there is no conflict in this world that cannot be mended by a real, honest, heart-to-heart talk.      The only reason why two people turn their backs on each other is because both of them have given up and neither want to give the other a chance anymore.  It is great to know that there's one of you who hasn't given up and that's YOU.  Good luck!|`|73379dc1f8c41f81eb66c1f2b7143f27aa	just remember women are fickle so they change like the wind but be honest and tell her how you feel  and if she still don't want to be together there ant much you can do you might want to invest in a PI  she is probably having an affair. women won't end a marriage unless there is another man, or money and independance some where in there|`|AA11928395	Hi there...  there could be a huge defination for marriage...

8284253a6cc3eae10d5138ac97837335aa	You are one click away from the "danger zone".  Ask yourself,  why are you asking this question if this is so platonic? If you are  thinking about her this much, you have already been "mentally  unfaithful"...since she appears to occupy more of your thoughts than your wife.  So...depending on what your values are,  you might  1. Have a   full blown affair  2. Divorce your present wife  3.Gradually "cool"  the relationship to a less intense level.|`|AA10665652	It wont be platonic for very long, but it's good that it's starting out that way!|`|b5b66daf9000f9fad7995e12ed98517eaa	There is definitely something between the two of you. However, you need to look at this more cautiously. Do you want to preserve your marriage? If so, any unnecessary contact between the two of you must stop, NOW. Does she wish to preserve her marriage? If so, again. stop NOW. Are you each looking at a loveless marriage? If so, you need to talk.|`|9d33c795cddf00af8aaed21d1306ec92aa	I think the fact that you are asking this question clearly shows that it's not just platonic in your mind anymore.     However, since you have talked to your wife about it, perhaps you don't feel too tempted, romantically speaking. I think it sounds like you two have a great partnership, one that is difficult to foster in a corporate world and is therefore more precious. I think avoiding her just turns this situation into something illicit-which it clearly is not, at this point.     Sounds like once you get over this initial confusion as you become close to another woman than your wife, everything should be fine.|`|a5282cf59fd85584ac62a0b3cabf4f32aa	Sounds more like, your starting to fall for her. I would either ask her, if she's kind of feeling this way too,& if so------,either back off a little, or,if it's the same feelings on both sides, then I think the two of you, should take a step back, & ask yourself's if your Marriage, may be lacking in some area's. Think it over!!!!!!

Be prepared to answer any questions that he asks like 'Is it me?' 'Don't you like me anymore?'     Be kind and gentle in your replies, particularly if he is an emotional or sensitive guy (yes there are some out there!)    Once it's over, be strong - don't be tempted to go back out with him again if you feel a bit miserable in the period whilst you are re-adjusting to being single again.    ~hope this helps|`|6259d13f21d0a72626ab858e208f4912aa	tell him you want to end it and why you want to. if he really loves you he'll understand completely|`|bd6b99ad58b64c6d743cd385d230d71caa	Well, for you, it seems too late for this....  but usually, you just   "disapear"     8{)~|`|AA10165867	Tell him and be honest. There are ways to be honest and not brutal at the same time. You may not need to break up with him if he will respect your need for space and take things slower. You can tell him you would like to continue in your relationship as friends, if you continue in it at all. I just depends on how long you have been together, how deeply involved you are. There may not be a way to end your relationship without hurting him, but if you explain it to him firmly and honestly it will hurt him a lot less in the long run than continuing on or trying to make excuses that you feel would soften the blow.
AA12291003	i think usually there is something about a person's appearance that grabs your attention- but it does not really mean that you have to be drop dead gorgeous. a persons eyes, their smile can captivate another especially if they notice you are really noticing them, listening to them|`|5921fc412d06b29e04dabec9d81c2f9caa	How about if you turn the question around ask that about girls?  Are there girls willing to look past outward appearance and appreciate what is on the inside? etc.    Majority of the people are visual-oriented and make decision based on what they see. After the initial visual attraction do most people appreciate what is on the inside.

Amen!|`|25eaf22facfa04c5112de21a456164f5aa	General WilliamBooth Enters Into Heaven by Vachel Lindsay    Booth led boldly with his big bass drum  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)  The Saints smiled gravely and they said, "He's come,"  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    Walking lepers followed rank on rank,  Lurching bravos from the ditches dank  Drabs the alleyways and drug fiends pale  Minds still passion ridden, soul flowers frail:  Vermin eaten saints with moldy breath,  Unwashed legions with the ways of Death  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    Ev'ry slum had sent its half a score  The world round over. (Booth had groaned for more).  Ev'ry banner that the wide world flies  Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes,  Big voiced lassies made their banjoes bang,  Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang;   "Are you? Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"    Hallelulah! It was queer to see  Bull necked convicts with that land made free.  Loons with trumpets a blare, blare, blare,  On, on, upward thro' the golden air!  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    Booth died blind and still by Faith he trod,  Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God!  Booth led boldly and he look'd the chief  Eagle countenance in sharp relief,  Beard a-flying, air of high command  Unabated in that holy land.    Jesus came from the court house door,  Stretched his hands above the passing poor.  Booth saw not, but led his queer ones  Round and round the mighty courthouse square.  Yet! in an instant all that blear review  Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new.    The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled,  And blind eyes opened on a new, sweet world.  Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole!  Gone was the weasel head, the snout, the jowel  Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean,  Rulers of empires and of forests green!  The hosts were sandall'd and their wings were fire!  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)    But their noise play'd havoc with the angel choir,  (Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)  Oh shout Salvation!  It was good to see Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free.  The banjos rattled and the tambourines   Jingling jingl'd in the hands of Queens.    And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer  He saw his Master thro' the flag fill'd air.  Christ came gently with a robe and crown  For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down.  He saw King Jesus; they were face to face,  And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Soy Mexicano a mucho orgullo y me encanta la gente orgulosa de su raza y de su pas, Se que en tu tierra son la gente mas amable del mundo y excelentes anfitriones; aqu en Mxico una gran cantidad de tus paisanos viven y viven bien, nuestro pas acoje como hijos a muchos extranjeros. Pero hay y tu lo sabes calidades d gente muy diferentes. No dudo que no tengas un bellsimo Pas con una basta cultura y con gente maravillosa. Mucha gente que sale de su pas de origen no se adaptan a las costumbres del lugar que lo adopta y viven en el pasado presumiendo y diciendo que lo que viven actualmente es una porquera, que solo en su pas se come buena carne o que solo en su pas las mujeres son bellas e inteligentes o que solo en su pas se vive de locura. Esa gente es la que nadie quiere, sean del origen que sean y es a la gente que se le encierra en un cuadro en el que :mal hecho hacemos entrar a toda una raza. Haz de conocer mexicanos de lo ms antipticos y presumidos a los que tu Pas adopt y eso no quiere decir que todos seamos igulales. En Estados Unidos viven millones de mexicanos, pero basta con que una peque?a parte sean buenos para nada, holgazanes y drogadictos para que as nos quieran catalogar a todos. Vive tu raz  con orgullo, no hagas caso de la gente que se atreve a generalizar porque es la gente que no vale su crtica. Yo conozco Argentinos en Mxico que son bellisimas personas y tremendamente trabajadoras, mujeres argentinas que cuidado con su belleza, la mezcla de las razas que tienen all ha creado gente muy bonita. Vive tu patria y goza a tu gente, si llegas a estar aqui algn da vers que tambin somos maravillosos.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	1. The most important thing is eye contact when flirting. This is really the one single golden rule of flirting! Sounds easy, but can initially be difficult to establish for longer than a second or two. So when you next go out, find a guinea pig to practice on! Once you have decided on your target, look directly at him/her, then look away and always accompany this look with a smile. If they seem not to have noticed you, look again and this time smile directly at him/her. At first this really will be hard but once you get a reaction you will find your confidence will increase.     2. Once they have noticed you it is worthwhile having a few lines prepared for when they come over. However, if this does not happen, despite what you thought was a good reaction to your earlier eye contact, why don't you try approaching him/her? It could be that they are feeling just as unsure as you, so it's better to try rather than wonder what might have been.     3. When you do get to talk to them, always remember to be pleasant and smile whilst flirting - this will help put the other person at ease and also gives the impression that you are relaxed, even if inwardly you are shaking with nerves!    ~hope this helps. If you have more questions please do not hesitate to ask!|`|5bc998621a15e006b8832697972849e4aa	act silly|`|15df53631d434455278c5549e23eb2bfaa	Flirting comes naturally, either you were born with or not,|`|a536972198d1b77e01fd38e59b3945c8aa	lol, flirting will come with age and certain levels of maturiaty.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the hardest things to do can be to tell some guy that you like him. Why?    The bottom line is, it's the fear of rejection - we ask people other questions all the days of our lives.    Therefore in order to ask the question, you have to study what's the worst that could happen. And that is the answer "no".    But there is nothing really to fear in the word no - it just means that he doesn't value you (his loss) or just doesn't think you are compatible (best to find out now) or he is seeing someone else (fair enough).    Hope this helps~|`|AA10066267	You cannot make someone love you.  If he doesn't feel the same attraction for you that you do for him then see if you can handle just being friends in case that is all he ever wants.  If he is worthy of your love he is worthy of your friendship.

AA10766729	You can get married any way you like if you're in the military.  If you would prefer to do it on the base at the base chapel by the base chaplain, then you need to discuss that with them.

A mi un ex me enga?o y ps terminamos, como a ti, me costo trabajo dejarlo pero lo deje al fin, al principio me dolia verlo con otra, me moria del coraje, pero despues comprendi q fue lo mejor para mi y q me merezco mas q eso.

Eso espero.   Si te ha enga?ado, ?Que lo detendra en hacertelo una vez mas?, si te hubiera querido en serio, no lo hubiera hecho, hubiera hablado con vos cualquier cosa, antes de llegar a esto.  Si un hombre enga?a es porque no esta conforme con su pareja, si estas bien, no tenes necesidad de enga?ar a tu pareja.  Mi consejo es que te olvides de el, o si no tomalo como alguien que no es especial, ?Que de especial puede tener alguien que te ha enga?ado?, si el chabon te gusta, habra otros que tambien te gustaran, asique tomalo con calma y actua correctamente.  Si no podes dejarlo, pero tampoco podes olvidar, es muy feo, porque tarde o tempra?o esos enga?os se pagan y vos le vas a retribuir esos que te hizo pasar a vos. Es una regla de oro de las parejas. Se puede aguantar todo, menos los cuernos.  ?No te sentis humillada al saber que estubo con otra?, no te pongas mal, sino que tomate tu tiempo, y cuando estes mejor, decile que no va mas.  Es el unico consejo que te puedo dar como hombre, el cuerno no se perdona.  Carlos|`|b3ec520a8f6e4db6e1374a6325cfb422aa	Tu primer error es: seguir denominandolo como "tu novio",  si l te enga?o, te fue infiel es por que obviamenete no te ama y esto a su vez invalida sus planes a futuro.      El perdn no excusa el comportamiento y  no significa la aprobacin. La persona que te hizo da?o probablemente hizo lo que hizo por su propia debilidad y sus limitaciones, creo que ya se los has perdonado pero como dices no puedes olvidar el hecho de que traiciono tu confianza. Te recuerdo que la confianza es parte importante de una relacion amorosa, y aun mas en tu caso ya que dices tener cinco a?os con tu pareja.    Yo en tu lugar no lo pensaria tanto, creo que no se puede amar a alguien que nos lastima, alguien que nos ha traicionado, alguien que no tiene nuestra confianza y sobre todo alguien que no nos ama de la misma forma que nosotros lo hacemos. Realmente creo que deberias dejarlo o por lo menos darse un tiempo, si las cosas cambian, s i tu dejas de interesarle, lo mejor es no regresar con l.

Hay infieles y de muchas clases.  Infieles por falta de seguirdad personal, incapaces de resistir la tentacin y sin desearlo, temen ser catalogados de mojigatos, tontos y cobardes y dominados por la mujer.  Hay infieles por pobreza de autoestima, es decir llegan a sentirsen valiosos, en la medida en que son admirados, amados y aceptados por los dems.  Sus coqueteos con otras mujeres, a veces irritan a la pareja, creando dudas a su alrededor y enredos con personas del sexo opuesto, son recursos para mostrarsen ms jovenes, atractivos, astutos, audaces , y competentes secualmente. poniendo en peligro relaciones de pareja realmente ms duraderas e importantes para el futuro,  buscando quizs recibir de otros la aceptacin que no son capaces de darse a si mismo.  Por lo general, estos episodios, no tienen may9r gravedad y no son motivo suficiente como para acabar con el hogar que quieren tener o vivir desde ahora y para siempre en el infierno que es la desconfianza y la angustia.      Una alternativa es trabajar juntos por rehacer la relacin, es to implica tener inters, perdonar y hablar sinceramente sobre los sentimientos y necesidades de cada uno, proponerse individualmentey en pareja, hacer la vida ms plaxcentera y facilitar el desarrollo del otro, evitar en lo posible constantes referencias acerca del pasado y soportar el paso del tiempo en espera de que Dios el Se?or cure tus heridas si se lo pide y permita ver que la decisin de seguir unidos sea una realidad.   Esta clase de problemas se resuelven en la amistad que lleguen a tener con Dios a traves de su palabra que nos hace libres por completo,  y nos hace ver que necesitamos de relaciones prohibidas que son insinuaciones del enemigo llamado diablo o satans para alejarnos de la verdadera felicidad que nos promete el Se?or en su palabra, por esto nos dice y nos promete que busquemos el reino de Dios primero que todo y lo dems nos  lo dar por a?adidura. y esto es todo cuanto necesitamos como es la estabilidad del hogar, la paz, la fidelidad, la fe, y el verdadero amor.  Ahora te digo que una persona que hace tales cosas es porque no sabe que tiene un vaco en su corazn que solo lo puede llenar Dios y ese vaco corresponde a El.  Si deseas ver respuestas claras y verdaderas que te ayuden a ver resuelto tu problema y quieres que Dios te ayude y haga libre tu vida y la de tu pareja, te invito a que hagas la siguiente oracin: Se?or Jess, hoy me arrepiento de todos mis pecados, aquellos que conozco, aquellos que ya he olvidado con el paso de los a?os, por todo pecado oculto, y principalmemte perdname por ignorarte y no agradecerte por la vida y la proteccin que me has brindado siempre, por todo cuanto me has dado hasta el dia de hoy y por permitir que este pasando por esta situacin, ya que tu quieres que yo te ame y te obedezca, por tanto quiero que tomes el control de mi vida, de mis sentimientos, emociones y afectos y lo mismo  de mi pareja, quiero y deseo con todo mi corazn hacerte mi Se?or mi Salvador, mi maestro y amigo, mi consejero, y deseo tomes el control de la vida de mi pareja y quites toda venda espiritual de la vida de El y la mia y nos ayudes a comprometernos en serte fiel a ti y tus promesas y las promesas que hayamos hecho como pareja y nos muestres que la infidelidad trae muchos males en lo futuro y mata el alma y el espritu. Quiero que escribas mi nombre en el libro de la vida y no lo borres jams de all, te lo pido Padre celestial en el precioso nombre de tu hijo Jesucristo, Amn.  Te recomiendo que leas la Sagrada Biblia que es la palabra de Dios si quieres que te vaya bien con tu pareja y para que Dios te de larga vida y te de unos hijitos llenos del amor de Dios, pues el amor borra toda multitud de pecados.   Empieza `por leer el Nuevo Testamento para que luego cuando leas el Antiguo Testamento lo puedas entender y ojala te congreges en una iglesia de sana doctrina y te recomiento ver los progbramas de enlace t.v. con la Pastor Jyce Meyer y pdele al Se?or te hable a traves de ella en su palabra, tambin busca en enlace al Pastor Robert Clefor donde habla al hombre acerca de el pecado tan grande que se comete a los ojos de Dios por la infidelidad. Ora al Se?or con tus propias palabra dicindole lo que sientes, el dolor que tienes en tu corazn, y que toque tu corazn y lo cure y le ayudes a confiar en el Se?or y en tu esposo y que restaure la relacin con tu pareja y le haga odiar ese pecado o esa aventura que no le traer nada bueno.Te deseo lo mejor y que Dios te bendiga y te ayude a cambiar esa situacin con tu pareja.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	1. The most important thing is eye contact when flirting. This is really the one single golden rule of flirting! Sounds easy, but can initially be difficult to establish for longer than a second or two. So when you next go out, find a guinea pig to practice on! Once you have decided on your target, look directly at him/her, then look away and always accompany this look with a smile. If they seem not to have noticed you, look again and this time smile directly at him/her. At first this really will be hard but once you get a reaction you will find your confidence will increase.     2. Once they have noticed you it is worthwhile having a few lines prepared for when they come over. However, if this does not happen, despite what you thought was a good reaction to your earlier eye contact, why don't you try approaching him/her? It could be that they are feeling just as unsure as you, so it's better to try rather than wonder what might have been.     3. When you do get to talk to them, always remember to be pleasant and smile whilst flirting - this will help put the other person at ease and also gives the impression that you are relaxed, even if inwardly you are shaking with nerves!    ~hope this helps. If you have more questions please do not hesitate to ask!|`|3eade608171b89f758192dee2ca03471aa	dude u sound exactly like me!!! cant figure out what to say, and need help flirting! sorry, i cant help, because i need help on the same thing!!!!

For example, the assistance you get from a registered Psychologist will be different to the advice that 'Father Fred' can offer. I'm not saying Father Fred has no place -- just explaining why counselling costs so much.    Everyone should be able to afford good counselling services though, which is why the government should also contribute to paying for such services.|`|9fd338fd054dfe1d8e01547b9b3b1b6caa	With all due respect, do you work for free?  Counselors need to have at least an M.S. degree and a license to practice.  You are looking at many years of post graduate work and internships.  Hey, look at the bright side...you could always ask your office buddy for advice.  That's probably free.|`|f55ed1ef22c12320aed7b106bac3e46aaa	Very simple, couseling is a service provided to help people solve lifes problems, in exchange for a set financial commitment. Not gonna' influence you in any kinda' "religious" direction, but there are many places that offer FREE family, marriage, and relationship couseling. These places are the little, (some huge) buildings with little crosses on them, you know, churches. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is finding a pastor with a degree in relationship couseling. Consider that, or keep paying for  somethin' you can get free.................|`|56e72ea74295dd6834ddb3da59577602aa	Check at churches, our church has a certified couselor on staff, she has a bunch of degrees, and the church pays her salary and people can make appointments with her.  Its really a blessing.
256fbccada9bea32597c418ca6194f26aa	Yo estuve dos a?os amando a otra persona con quien slo poda comunicarme por telfono. Lo duro es cuando la necesidad del encuentro y del roce es unilateral porque una de las dos personas ser la que ms sufra. Desde el fondo de mi corazn desalentara esa relacin por incompleta. Una relacin as tiende a diluirse o a romper corazones. Slo escuchars una voz, no podrs ver sus gestos, ni la expresin de su rostro. Reconocers sus estados anmicos y  Aprenders a sufrir o a alegrarte por el tono de su voz. No podrs abrazarlo ni besarlo por sus ocurrencias ni sostenerlo entre tus brazos cuando te necesite. Ambos proyectarn carencias, ideales en esa relacin, tanto fsicos como espirituales; ideales que lgicamente se derrumbarn cuando se enfrenten a la realidad de las imperfecciones humanas en el futuro encuentro y ah se darn cuenta de que no vali la pena armar castillos en el aire a travs del telfono.|`|AA10315978	si , si se puede, solo se tiene que no dudar, el uno del otro.|`|a265d5eb047765e0e682aa453a3bf900aa	Bueno metiendose mentiras quizas se lleguen a ver, pero estaran disecados y con tela de arana sin tocarse que dificil eh   me pregunto y mientras tanto que masturbacion en accion!!!!!!|`|0fcf7e045196b636a1acaf2215eda1f2aa	no creo, muy dificil , pero suerte|`|f4433d7afc5b5d41a2a8239e7689df95aa	Si se puede, pero tendra que ser una relacin basada en el completo desapego...  Sin esperar nada uno del otro, y amndose incondicionalmente...  Cosa que no todos sabemos hacer.    Pero para poder hacer eso la primera relacin que debes cultivar es la que tienes contigo mismo...    Las interacciones con los otros pueden causarnos mucha alegra.  La alegra de compartir aventuras juntos, momentos en nuestra vida y nuestros pensamientos.  Ellas pueden ser tambin la causa de la mayora de nuestras confusiones, inestabilidad y dolor si no las entendemos y funcionamos con ellas.    Para la mayora de la gente, nosotros simplemente no sabemos cmo funcionan las relaciones, as que proyectamos nuestras expectativas, necesidades y carencias sobre otros.  Podra ser nuestros amigos, nuestros compa?eros de trabajo nuestros seres amados ms cercanos, pero tanto como los amamos, podemos sentirnos lastimados y malentendidos.  En la mayora de los casos esto nos lleva a negar quienes somos para poder recibir el amor que estamos buscando desesperadamente.    El ms grande de todos los malos entendidos es la relacin primordial y esa es la relacin contigo.  ?Como demonios se supone que conozcamos y amemos a otras personas si no nos conocemos ni nos amamos a nosotros mismos?  Para la mayora de nosotros, no tenemos idea de quienes somos.  Creemos que sabemos lo que nos gusta y lo que no nos gusta, y eso define un tipo de personalidad.  Pero an eso cambia con las estaciones, las modas, el ambiente y con la vida.  La mayora de nosotros contina por la carretera de la vida siendo un extra?o con la persona que ms importa y esta es nuestro ser.    En el trayecto del descubrimiento del Ser echamos un vistazo a quien realmente somos.  Alguna gente no quiere hacer eso y tienen miedo de aventurarse en este espacio ya que estn temerosos de que pueda no gustarles lo que encuentren.  ?No es eso extra?o?  Pero lo he escuchado muchas veces.  Debido a que hemos pasado a?os y hasta la mayora de nuestras vidas negando quienes somos y estamos temerosos de realmente expresar quienes somos, creemos que puede ser feo y que la negacin es ms segura que la aventura del descubrimiento.  ?Cmo podra ser eso posible?    No importa por lo que hemos vivido, las decisiones que hemos tomado y situaciones en las que hemos estado, existe tanta belleza, unicidad y creacin esperando a ser descubierta en ti.  Simplemente permitindole ser revelada, te vuelves abierto a un mayor entendimiento y experiencia de la vida por medio de ser el tu real.  Entonces te permites a ti mismo ser perfecto exactamente como eres y ver la vida en esa perfeccin tambin.  Esa es la nica manera en la que puedes plenamente experimentar una relacin, cualquier relacin con cualquiera, es estando completo y estable dentro de ti mismo.     Hasta que eso es establecido cualquier relacin est envuelta por necesidades y expectativas.  Esas son las relaciones de quitar para llenar algo que parece estar vaco o incompleto.  Ese algo eres t.  Si necesitas que alguien sea o haga, entonces existe un aspecto de ti que est incompleto y t ests esperando que esta otra persona pueda llenarlo por ti.      Cuando ellos no viven o actan de acuerdo a tus expectativas, t sientes el dolor.  Es una relacin viciosa que es muy dolorosa.  Existe muy poca seguridad, paz y verdadero amor en ella.  La nica forma en la que puede ser verdadero amor, es amndote a ti mismo primero.  Desde ese espacio la relacin est basada en dar.  T ya ests pleno, estable y en un amor gentil y contento, y eso es lo que naturalmente sale hacia tu mundo.  Eso entonces se vuelve la base de las relaciones a tu alrededor y eso es lo que crece entre tu y cualquier otro.  Es un cambio tan peque?o, pero es asombroso en su diferencia.  Tu contento y tu amor entonces viene de dentro de ti sin importar lo que pasa a tu alrededor.  Es increblemente liberador.    Existe una relacin que hasta desbanca esto.  Tan grande como es, hay ms.  Puede naturalmente empezar a expandirse en tu experiencia simplemente por medio de aprender a amarte a ti mismo.  Y esa es la relacin con la divinidad dentro de ti. Cuando empiezas a reconocer el aspecto espiritual de tu verdad, de tu esencia y tu razn de estar aqu, es muy difcil todo lo dems en su divinidad tambin.  Desde ese espacio todo tiene su orden, perfeccin y razn de existir.  Cada interaccin es para que reconozcas ms el orden divino, y cada hipo aparente se vuelve un regalo para ti para amar an ms tu ser y tu mundo.  Los juicios se derriten, el miedo se disuelve y el mundo se vuelve un mgico patio de juegos y una excitante aventura.    Desde esta conciencia de la vida, las interacciones con otros son totalmente significativas en ese preciso momento y nada necesita ser arreglado, cambiado, adquirido o abandonado.  Todas las personas son una parte de esta asombrosa aventura, juntos.    La mxima relacin no tiene un principio o fin, a medida que te das cuenta que todo lo que has hecho, lo que has pasado y experimentado ha sido perfecto para este camino del despertar.  Esta relacin contina profundizndose y expandindose en mayores entendimientos de la vida que realmente tienen un impacto en el momento y entonces se van.  En estas relaciones solo existe la esencia verdadera de la vida, todo lo de la vida y eso es amor.  La ms grande danza es aprender a amar incondicionalmente otra vez, liberar los miedos y juicios y arrojar nuestros brazos bien abiertos y abrazar todo lo que esta mgica vida tiene para ofrecer.    Desde ese espacio, cada uno es una alegra y una expresin nica de esa verdad divina floreciendo en la perfeccin para la que fueron hechos.  ?No es grandioso?  La vida es maravillosa y est aqu para ser disfrutada por todos nosotros.|`|2358ab78e099b3b1044293ab1c3ce423aa	creo que amor de lejos es amor de pen.......sarlo mucho aunque ojos que no ven corazon que no siente|`|401a563bad6a3a39cc9efe8f75bb5726aa	Mi novio vive en Cuba y hace dos meses que no lo veo ,solo puedo escribirle todos los dias ,tan siquiera puedo llamarlo por lo mucho que cuesta ,pero asi sin escuchar su voz ni ver su rostro yo puedo sentir que lo amo y el a mi.Asi que no te guies nunca por los pesimistas ,solo ten confianza en tu corazon y este  nunca te desfraudara .Estoy segura de que si a pesar de la destancia el acepto continuar como pareja es porque te ama como a nadie,,,ten mucha fe .Y amor .|`|4502e9806e468c30835bbb5041e35863aa	No es imposible, pero por experiencia propia te digo que es muy dificil.Un noviasgo es compartir momentos e incluso crearlos.Yo estube en una relacion asi y el chavo termino poniendome el cuerno.|`|936176024c5924258a13b0a5277ddfc7aa	Como aca dice "no es imposible"... igual 2 a?os es arto - y no se si tu o tu pareja se aguantaran.

Monitor the credit card statements and cell phone bills for strange charges or numbers (excessive amounts of calls to a specific number).

Assim, quem gosta de um determinado programa, n?o seria obrigado ENGOLIR o que est sendo apresentado, por n?o ter op??o. Pessoalmente isso  uma falta de respeito!!!

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	One of the tried and tested problems through relationship history has been finding out whether that girl or guy you have pined over for years really likes you or not.     Should you pluck up the courage and just ask them out, or is it alright to ask their mates if they like you? This may seem easier, but in fact, in the long run it is not the best way to find out if they have a crush on you!    I always recommend that you simply ask the person out, before it drives you crazy. It at least shows that you are serious. If they say no, then it is their loss. And if they say yes, then, well it can be the start of something beautiful. Asking them out via their friends is simply a cowardly way to do it. So go on, bite the bullet and ask her/him out today!    Hope this helps~ if you need more help just ask!

Que ocurre: El alcohol se absorbe rpidamente del estmago a la circulacin general, y as llega al cerebro en dnde un enzima se encarga de metabolizar la sustancia. Hay personas cuya enzima trabaja ms rpido o se encuentra al parecer en mayor cantidad. Estas personas entonces no se afectan tanto o por completo al tomar. Se cree que lo contrario ocurre en prsonas con poca enzima.  Pero cuidado. Esto no significa que puedes tomar desmedidamente ni en grandes cantidades. Puede llegar el momento, en el que al resistirlo ms, necesites ingerir cada vez ms sustancia para poder estar satisfecho con ella, y sin darte cuenta podras hacer tolerancia y aumentar las probabilidades de padecer alcoholismo. Ahora, al beber tienes que estar claro que el alcohol afecta los vasos sanguneos, el hgado y el pncreas, y con esto, con o sin enzima cerebral, hay consecuencias. Se siempre prudente y por supuesto, utiliza un conductor designado (tranporte pblico, taxi), sin importar que tan bien puedas sentirte. Te lo digo yo eh?. Suerte.

Love is different for everyone, it doesn't have to be obsession. But in the end, the only person who can judge if you truly "love" another is yourself. I'm guessing, you haven't had much experience, and maybe don't have anything to compare it to. But perhaps the fact that you're having doubts points to an answer: you should continue looking. Do not settle for something that doesn't feel right, a "gut feeling" can be a good indicator of what what's going on even when we can't quite put our finger on it.|`|6ff2cfaf0df0ace2e6032ac16e45c202aa	I would say that you are probably not ready yet to be married.

5db41ddb525e64e8cdbfc3ee18336773aa	I had the exact same thing happen to me once.  This guy I had a crush on forever decided to ask me out.  A week or two later he flew, like 1500 miles away for Christmas.  He had been planning on moving there.  He told me that he didn't know if he was gonna come back after the week was over.  He knew the whole time that he was gonna come back to me.  We've been together for 5 years and married for 1 of those.  Because of me, he has lived in my area for an extra 5 years.  Just let your guy know how bad you want him to come back.  Hopefully he cares the same way about you.  You always have to let your feelings known.  Just try not to sound crazy-mad in love.  No one wants to come off as crazy.  Use your heart and your judgment.|`|AA12162653	I think you are too young to be worrying about this, its only a damn week!

However, if you think that he is going to be gone forever, you may want to evaluate how he feels about you. Have you guys talked about the living situation? Does he feel like he can't live without you too? Because if he wants to be with you as much as you want to be with him I am sure you can work something out. Just don't be too hasty to decide on leaving all your friends and family for some guy who only sort of likes you.  Your friendships are NOT worth loosing over some guy! Believe me, I have done it and it was DUMB!!!! :) Good luck!|`|AA12197129	how old r u? if you are old enough then go and find him and let him know.|`|8845a666da9202d6afcf6d6121345b3eaa	First, what are your options?  1) Can you go with him to Colorado, and would you even want to?    2) If not, how do you feel about a long-distance relationship?    I have been in a long-distance relationship recently, and one of the biggest things I would have you ask yourself would be: Do you trust him?  If you have known him for a while and think you can trust him, then why not give it a shot?  My long distance relationship was tough because my girlfriend could not, would not, do something to help me feel secure.  If you feel insecure about him being far from you, then I would think about what he could do to help you feel more secure.  There are so many variables that I don't know about and since every relationship has its own unique dynamic, it is tough for me to elaborate too much.  I wish you luck and you are welcome to email me if you would like to discuss this more with me.

d429512af0c9511f774ba1c739a95fbaaa	The myth (that most of these women posters believe, apparently) is that the way a women dresses has nothing to do with rape.  Of course it sometimes does.  It also has to do with the way she acts!  Ask yourself, who is more likely to be raped:  1.  A drunk, flirty girl in a super-short micro skirt.  2.  A girl who stays at home studying while wearing jeans and a turtle neck.  Now that wasn't so hard, was it?|`|025b9ef1176559264e4aa48380aa6993aa	You ignorant fool!

They get targeted because the rapist doesn't think they'll tell anyone and get them caught. It's not the way women dress most of the time, it's just that the man is a bastard who can't keep his dick in his pants long enough to care about someone else's feelings.|`|5cd930699a01c380a1366c7bddb20cf1aa	I love to see a beautiful lady dressed sexy.

Women get raped for alot of reasons and those reasons have to do wit the rapist. They r sick and not human beings. I don't know why they like raping women. It's wrong. There r girls as young as 10 probably younger that r getin raped. They dress appropriately. If it was based on how girls dress than girls that ware really short short skirts will be raped, girls wit the stomach all out and skanky hoeish clothes will be the only ones getin raped. I've never heard of a girl wearin clothes like that getin raped. Girls ( including little girls )  wearin clothes that cover themselves and don't have things sticking out all over the place and dress maturely for their age wouldn't be gettin raped. How u dress has nothin to do wit why so many girl r getin raped. Any girl can be raped.

However, she could perhaps talk to a family member, preacher or neighbor who may be able to help her try to help her mother without risking the state removing her.

Her mom should make the sacrafice and get help, to be a good parent. But a parent like that, who ignores her daughter for drugs should not be respected, in my opionion. If I was Kate, and my mom refused to get help for something like drugs, I would call the police or do something for her to get help. Living in a household like that until she's grown will pose problems for Kate becuase kids usually follow in their parents footsteps. Such as parenting techniques and living styles. I would try your best to get with Kate, and devise a plan to get help for her. There is NO excuse for neglecting a child. Help Kate help her mom get help is my advice.    P.S. - I would consider the numbers posted in the 2nd answer. Also, you may try confronting her. I've thought, if Kate doesn't want to lose her mom, shouldnt go to the police, maybe just those hotlines.

886ae7391e9d3d67fdab48522c707305aa	He likes you for sure, but doesn't know what to do about it. A 10 year difference can be pretty significant, especially depending on his age. If he's in his early 20s or younger, a 10 year difference is huge for him.    Also, he might be a little worried about you being older, since he's the guy etc.     But you won't know what the problem is unless you ask him about it. So try to get him away from work somewhere and just talk to him, openly and honestly. Good luck!|`|AA11608043	it sounds like he does like you, but since he's a shy guy, he's become more quiet lately.  Plus, i think he might want not want you to know that he likes you, so instead he's acting "frustrated" with you, so that his true emotions don't come out.  Or, maybe he is just in a shock mode, from having a woman flirt with him..|`|cb631f11df9f1165a558bf5d53e4894caa	ask him, but if it's a work relationship remember, if you go out then it doesn't work out then you still have to see him every day|`|AA11877958	sounds like he has a personality disorder.....no confidence or something...real weird....the shy silent strange type that goes home from work and sits in his underwear and tube socks and eats frozen dinners..how much fun could he be...?? ever watched the movie one hour photo??

Ten en cuenta que es un arma de dos filos, si lo reconoce, tu podrs exigir que mantenga a tu hijo, pero el por su parte  tendr derechos sobre el ni?o, podr llevrselo de vacaciones, paseos etc, incluso podra llevrselo a su pas  y si el es adinerado podra pedir la custodia del ni?o y quitrtelo y llevarlo lejos de tu pas y de ti.  yo supe del caso de una mujer al que el padre del hijo como era adinerado logro que los jueces le dieran la custodia del ni?o y se lo llevo a sud Amrica a vivir con su esposa porque ella no poda tener hijos.

Qu beneficios obtiene este se?or al convertirse en padre? en Argentina, la patria potestad es compartida por los padres por ejemplo.

018568bf99d2d523ad5f61ab604568f2aa	two strangers meet and decide to share a pizza together and then they have the best sex of thier (their?) lives, over and over on into the wee hours of the morning. they are both on the rebound from relationships...lonely... and they realize they are very happy to have found each other. before dawn he tells her that he loves her. she responds by putting her arms around his neck and whispering in his ear how happy she is because she is in love with him. he moves into her apartment and they live together for 18 months. one day she tells him that if he doesn't marry her in 2 weeks the relationship will end. he's like, damn this is the best       i ever had...and she keeps the place spotless and is a great cook. do i have a choice? soooo....he falls for it and they marry. he immediately feels a change in their relationship, nothing he could put into words but there was something different. in the fall of that year her father dies and leaves her his home valued at $350,000.00. the will is contested by her brother and 2 sisters and to settle the matter the house is refinanced and she gives each $50,000.00. the re-fi is arranged by her and she puts the home in her name. during the next four years he continues to add his $4800.00 monthly income to their joint account and  spends $28,000.00 of his personal savings to renovate the home. she starts to refer to the home as her home, my this and my that. words are exchanged one evening concerning the home and he tells her he thought they were in this marriage together...emotionally as well as financially. her words flow in a condescending tone "this property was left to me,  what did your parents give you?"  the following summer his father dies and leaves him $11,000,000.00 dollars and due to his dads kindness and generosity he was able to retire at the age of 42.  he pays cash for a home in sedona az. and one on the coast in la jolla ca.. relatively modest homes but very nice and in great locations. he still loves his wife very much and comes to live with her when the mood strikes. he feels that she is a lovely woman and well worth hanging on to. it saddened him each time he flew out west and thought back to the day he told her of the money his dad had left to him...that look on her face when the realization swept over her remembering the words she said concerning what was hers... her fleeting dreams of an early retirement from a job she hated...  the mortgage, taxes and various other bills she had to pay on her property and things that were hers.  she tried to make subtle changes in the ownership rulings she made years earlier.  but rules were rules and although he loved her very much her family had not left her enough money to enable her to retire and enjoy the good life with him. it wasn't that he was a selfish person. over and over he  wished to himself that she had handled her piddeling inheritance differently. but what could he do?...she was the one who made the ruling on the subject. it struck him  how  money  changes peoples lives and relationships with their spouses...true story.|`|AA11380378	went on with their own bussiness.|`|3d65fa879abd1ce93691268f923e0b5daa	loved!|`|3bb8502f2a704ce6ed2ff693723fba64aa	he layed her back on the hood of his car and gave her oral pleasure.|`|9e2130ec276925af9eb23573fa721694aa	...pass like the ships in the night.|`|d0d638f3751b71afb307fcc673c05aebaa	...sense an energy about them that at first seems uncomfortable.

8a98c35381b5bc29eb0bd47aa8c078f8aa	I am not sure if it cute or pathetic but here it goes......I was bout the age of 4 and playing in my room.  The ceilings were sloped and I had two little cubby hole closets on that side of my room.  My grandparents came to visit their favourite little granddaughter and i took them to my room and showed my Papa my new tricycle that my mom and dad bought.  I could see a perfectly beautiful red trike in there but nobody else could.  Needless to say Papa went out and bought me a new trike.  I guess imaginary toys are far better than imaginary friends cause grandparents can buy the toys for you hehe.

21be3c05f0536f4b74feeeec90b6d4faaa	Yes he did leave and i took him back the second time around.It took a few months for me to take him back and he was sincere i believed him.He was so good to me for a while but then wanted to leave again.I haven't taken him back a third time enough was enough.I'm not a toy in a closet that you can take out and play with and put away when you feel like it.He convinced me in so many ways that he wouldn't leave again but he did.I just think that you can give a person a second chance but a third no.I'm happy with someone else now for 9 years and my 3rd child is with him. Every now and then the B>....still asks if i would ever take him back?Let him keep asking,my kids don't even call him.They love my man and call him dad.|`|93bdc6b6a8012fb997783f19f470a8a5aa	I didnt have that, but my friend had it. He dumped her, and she was distrought, but then about a week later he realised how wrong he was. She gave him a second chance, and now they couldn't be happier.    If you are referring to yourself, then you need to ask yourself whether you want to give him a second chance, or whether he blew it. Taking someone back differs from person to person, and you need to do what YOU think is best. Above all, follow your heart, and good luck.    Xx

AA12048147	this woman needs to be told, by you, to back off... she has no right to interfere with your marriage in anyway , shape or form...... copy the e-mails and tell her you will turn them into the boss of the company she works for...... she is going out of bounds here and needs to be stopped.. personal e-mails are most times a big no no at a business.... and if they are coming to your house then she also is stepping over the boundries..... make sure you start copying them all...... you never know when they may come in handy....... God bless|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Oh HELL no! That  would NOT go over will with me sister! Those emails are completely inappropriate, and your husband should tell her so straight up. They are inappropriate, and unprofessional, and if your husband is saying that he just 'ignores' it, when he knows it bothers you so much, there might be reason to be paranoid. Tell him to tell her to stop NOW, and if he doesnt, I'd go straight to the hoochie's house and ground and pound her, pop her implants, put her in a rear naked choke hold, and give her a nice Chuck Lidell overhand right! Seriously though, she is way overstepping her bounds and asking for trouble. And the hubby sounds fishy.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	No way that would make me angry as well.

That's all I have to say about that......|`|AA11649471	Well if he is telling you this stuff.. then I wouldnt worry so much about it.  Just because the woman is attractive. she may have a yucky personality.  Keep in mind also.. that sometimes in a work related situation like that.. his hands is tied (in a way) Not knowing what kind of woman she is or how she would react to him telling her off or trying to make her quit.. she could do some real harm amongst her other co-workers or boss(s).  Your husband (if he is ignoring her) is doing the best thing that he can do in my opinion.  I might suggest to save these emails. . and when the timing is right. .. they could be forwarded to her boss or used against her.. if she were to try to stir up trouble with him.  While I dont believe in tattling.. I do believe in covering your A**.  In this situation. I would be keeping them just in case you might need them at a later date.   Also if he is telling you all of this.. then there must be some trust on his end.  If he had anything to hide at all he would have never mentioned it.  Good Luck.|`|AA11549317	Your husband need to block her e-mails and not communicate with her at all.  You need to confront her and cut off ties with her. Tell her you no longer consider her your friend.|`|d539e0f005a399fb0b2ed8261bc154edaa	I guess I know what I'd be thinking and I wouldn't just curl my head under and look the other way|`|0ea32b80cccef64a9d959b86002a60b5aa	Being worried depends upon the level of trust that you have in your husband.  Granted (some) men tend to have a weakness when it comes to infidelity because they don't always define sex from the point of view in which women tend to which is linking sex to our emotions - sometimes for (some) guys it's just a physical thing which is why they can have extramarital affairs and say they don't mean anything and they swear they are in love with their wives.  It's not that I think you are being paranoid but rather cautious when it comes to a woman who is after YOUR man - tell your husband your concerns but assure him that you trust him and it wouldn't hurt if you were about your business with him in and out of the bedroom - instead of allowing her to send him emails with suggestive comments - why don't you send him emails and give him voice mails and phone calls throughout the day to get him fired up about his evenings and nights with you|`|8dea6045504b8d6ca9dfb786e1cfc9afaa	I would swallow your paranoia and talk to this women while your man is presant.....kiss him dress nice and tell her that you appreciate her intrests in YOUR man flaunt it work it and kiss him again and when you get home tell him he better block he e-mails and avoid her like the plage or you'll have the locks changed and will make sure he never gets pussy again!!!|`|AA10041385	No, I would not be worried.  I'd be ANGRY.  At the woman, but more importantly, at my SPOUSE!  If this is happening in the workplace, it's called sexual harrassment.  If he has not taken action to stop it, on some level, no matter how small, he is probably flattered/enjoying it.  You are not paranoid.  Why are you second guessing yourself?  He's married.  She is tempting him to infidelity/adultery.  Him allowing it to continue unabated is an affront to you.  You had better tell him to take action and make it stop!  If it were I, I'd ask him why the hell he hasn't straight out told her he is married and considers her behavior offensive and completely unacceptable!  Shoot, why don't the two of you show up together and confront her?  I would.  The reason this type of amoral garbage is perpetuated is because noone talks about it.  It's like a dirty little secret.  People treat us the way we allow them to treat us.  Stand up for yourself, sista!|`|779380dbdd8457830dfe7cc17031bd35aa	You need to tell your Man that HE needs to tell her to back off, but make sure you are their to hear it, He can always say that he told her but unless you hear him say it to her your always going to be paranoid.|`|83df8932fe6c97cf2dac395976e7ef78aa	Um YES I would be worried. There are a couple of possibilities here. I know you've seen the e-mails but have you actually met this woman and heard her say these things? If so I'd tell her to back the F@%& off in person. If not...well...    It's kind of weird your husband is telling you she said that to him and that her finds her attractive. That doesn't seem like something a smart husband would say to his wife! Maybe his buddies while drinking beers at a bar, but his wife? Could he be just blowing things out of proportion trying to make you a bit jealous by inventing a rival?

You can probably tell if shes being two-faced just by talking to her. Does she talk about other people behind their back?? Does she always complain to you about other people? If so, then she could be doing it to you too. Make some new friends, and just distance yourself from her. You don't need to stop being her friend, but just make some new ones and include her less and less, over time she will realize what a good friend you were and wished that she treated you better..
21be3c05f0536f4b74feeeec90b6d4faaa	Simple you just ask him or her.Do you like me? and don't fear rejection.In life you have to take chances.The worst thing the person can do is say no.It might hurt but you at least know that you tried.You put your cards on the table and let them know how you felt.I think it would be an even better question is do you like me and would you consider going out with me?

ce01e08331613f0080c5b4389b0a1ab4aa	Get outta here, you are cute! But maybe she's not supposed to be liking boys, so she wants to keep it private. There could be any reason. But NONE of us know what it is.    All we can do is guess, buddy boy. Your best bet is to talk to her. Ask her yourself since you're obviously not shy about it. She probably would appreciate that instead of you asking the thousands on this forum, right?

I'd say it is not appropriate, you need to first have a friendship with him and test his affections - that they're not misplaced somewhere i.e. seeing you for someone your're not.

1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	Honesty is a big part of the problem. Some guys just don't be honest in letting the women they see that they're only interested in sex and lead the woman on.    With that said, it takes two to tango. At some point, she has to recognize some sign(s) that the guy is a loser and cut things off. It's easier said than done for some.    Bottom line, there's plenty of blame to go on both sides.|`|520e789d3dbd446939abf449a293b23faa	Women do the same thing buckaroo, which gender do you want to look at the tarnished reputation of?|`|36dedc6234086b51ab6441fc458288dfaa	it could be that they haven't matured yet these days the men (or i should say little boys cause that's Wat i consider them when all that happens little BOYS!!!!) don't understand what happens when they give those other guys who are not like them a bad name just because they had to have sex with a girl and that's that not thing else happens after that. just take it and leave the poor girl there and have the gentile with a bad rep don't be like them u know|`|8e53455ec2674aea4e1ec8cebc46f761aa	Because, all guys care about is sex then they go out with a new girl the next night ,and think that they can get that girl in bed.

c84ed3e6f5c0c85c529eb3fd51d87acaaa	Your dad is ok with it because its your brother if you were in the situation your dad would hate it! Make your dad see it through your eyes!|`|AA11826121	It is easy ... just report her to the police... she is an adult and he is a minor!|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	I wouldn't be so quick to call the cops. Age of consent laws vary from state to state - and that only relates to sex.     If your dad is okay with it, then there's pretty much nothing you can do about it. If she isn't good enough for him, he's gonna have to realize that on his own.|`|9a11854abbfe189ba661626691f93792aa	What you are describing is against the law.  But if your dad knows this girl maybe he's comfortable with the relationship.  Personally I think the maturity level is too much of a gap.|`|bfbd6cfcc4665bfc3d4feb192404cdebaa	First off, what state are you in? It may very well be illegal, and you can make that point out. Most states dont allow a minor to be with an adult, even if sex is absent, so you can either make note to your father as well as brother, or go to the extreme and go to the cops.   If its legal in your state, talk to the girl and see what she is doing with him. In his defense, age is only a number, cant really do much about it. Now if intentions are pure then let them have fun. However, if she truly is out to hurt him then understandably step up.    I have been with a guy twice my age, my mom went ballistic and tried to stop us, then I got her to meet him and now she is in love with the guy, and we are no longer together. His intentions were to obviously have sex with a young girl, however, he also cared/cares for their feelings.   My advice to you is to try and make nice with the girl. I am assuming you are around her age so you can prob get away with being "friends". Be there for your brother as well. As much as you dont like the situation, and you have stated your opinion, your brother still deserves your support and in the event he does get hurt, you can be there to comfort him. However, realize this, you cant protect him from "danger" in love. Even if the girl was his age, he could end up just as hurt. To be honest, it seems like you are too into the numbers and not the situation. Set aside the numbers and look at the situation and maybe youll see it from his prospective. I understand he is your baby brother, and its hard to keep a level head. However, try your best. Best of luck to you :)

f465490ec19495d4d6170bb537172943aa	Do not involve this man in your daughters life until you are really sure that he is here to stay. She might end up getting attached to him and then poof one day he may be gone. My advice is to take it slow and don't rush things and if you do introduce them, make sure that you and him remain at a friendship level until afterhours. it is not healthy for a child to see their parent with many others exept their other parent and it could confuse them. He is your "friend" not hers so let it ve that until you really know what the deal is. I was with my boyfriend when my son was less than a year old, he ended up staying around until he was 6 but now we are not together and he asks for him all the time. This man raised my son as his but now that we have separate lives my child is not of great importance to him. So not only is his father gone, but so is the other man that raised him. I watch him suffer because he is young and doesnt understand that they didn't leave him, they are gone from the relationship with me.|`|AA10694554	You gotta let ur daughter know ! or she'll hate him till the rest of her life ! then do wut ever u want !|`|AA11137303	Let him know that there is a kid and see how he feels about it.

44238d68d4b76a5d30950a1cbabffb4caa	Hates you? How much does he hate you? I think "hate" is a strong word, perhaps, dislikes you?    Well, it is possible that he likes you and just hides it with pretense.    But, I am afraid you are getting a bad case of the flu. If you like guys who hate you, you are probably one of those girls who willingly walks into abusive relationships. You need to go sit down with someone and get this clarified.

One-sided love is always a failure, it will waste a lot of things of yours. Love is possible only between two people from their own interests. If he loves you forcefully, do you think you will be happy ? No my dear. It's your life, value it.     Remember.... he might hate, may be there is someone else who is love with you, but you are avoiding. Love is only two-sided. You'll definitely get someone whom you love and he's also in love with you.     Forget this guy, he is unlucky !!!|`|5b3eb80a3207d73b19e6bdcb09448b69aa	Maybe u think they just hate you. Sometimes we can't tell if they do or not. And if they do that could change. Let your best colors shine and show them that u are independent and that you have characteristics that they would like. Don't smother yourself near them all the time but sort of remind them with little things without really directly telling him. Get it? I know it's confusing and it takes time but it's worth it to see the change...|`|e89292d882068c54a8f5d651f3c99dbaaa	Oh gosh, why do they hate you?

adfcedd0efb150da73cd1894fa705bf7aa	First of all, since you are still married, you have joint legal and physical custody. You should contact a lawyer to get the temporary custody set up. You will need a lawyer for your divorce, so you might as well get things going now. As it stands, your husband has the right to take your son as much as you do. But you need to petition the family court to make a determination on temporary custody until your divorce hearing. A lawyer would be the best way to ensure you've done everything properly.|`|a7cd4d5babdaca8813b9a8973f4e9e8eaa	go to your local courthouse first thing tomorrow morning, and explain to them what the situation is, I don't know the laws in Texas, but more than likely you will have to file for custody of the child, and be seen before the judge,   If the child is in danger by the father, call the police, or social services.     As long as there is no custody in order now, you don't have to return the child, at least in my state, but you better have a good reason, when you go before the judge!  Hope this helps, Good Luck    go to www.texasfamilylawyers.com|`|02dec76820a66ded576dfb31dc096d9faa	I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you because texas has different laws and different ways they do things than the state i live in, but what you should do is call the "welfare" office and talk to a social services worker and find out all the details, i am positive they will be more than happy to assist you and provide you with the information that you need.|`|55be765f1de92a1f861be3885cacbe96aa	Do a search for the family court in your town.

b6a533efb28b0c70f009ab63e4a0cec7aa	No es exactamente q se orinen...    Eso es un liquido mucoso, q pueden liberar las mujeres cuando estan muy exitadas, en el climax, es una eyaculacion femenina.  Muchas veces cuando se hace mucho contacto con el punto (G) de las mujeres pueden liberar este liquido.  Se dice q las mujeres sienten ganas de orinar, pero no es pipi exactamente, quisas aya un poco... pero en realidad como dije: es un liquido mucoso, q expulsan las mujeres a un alto grado de exitacion.  Parecido al liquido transparente mucoso (ba-bo-so) q expulsamos nosotros los hombres cuando estamos bien exitado, es un liquido q sierve tanto para lubricar en la penetracion de la vagina y preparar (limpiar) el conducto del pene para q pueda salir el "esperma"    - Siguiendo con tu pregunta....  En ingles he escuchado el nombre de: (Squirt, o Squirting).

Talk about the towns you live in, what your favorite things to do are. Talk about what your favorite foods are, or favorite movies. Tell eachother (clean) jokes. Talk about what kind of school you went to, what you like to do for employment. Whether or not you like animals, and if so, what type and why. It's pretty easy once you get past these basic questions. They are just the ice breakers to help you get more comfortable during your conversation, and give you an idea of what type of person you are talking to. Then you will know from there whether or not you want to move the phone calls on to something more like a date out. If you do go on a date, make sure it's to a meal and early movie. Say lunch, then catch a Matenee...this way, if you aren't comfortable, you aren't forced to be alone with them in the dark, and you can still make it home in time to have the rest of the evening to yourself.

If it's a bunch of namecalling & badmouthing about nothing in particular, or if it gets violent in any way, that's definitely a sign of a bad relationship.

Starving, dirty, smelled  terrible, skinny and hair all matted down. We felt  sorry for her, put her in a carrier and took her to  the vet.       We didn't know what to call her, so we named her  "Pussycat."           The vet decided to keep her for a day or so.         He said he would let us know when we could come and  get her. My husband (the complainer) said, "OK, but   don't forget to wash her, she stinks."        He reminded the vet that it was his WIFE that wanted  the dirty cat, not him.       My husband and my Vet don't see eye to eye.        He calls my   husband "El-Cheap-O," my husband calls him  "El-Take-O."       They love to hate each other and constantly "snipe" at  each other, with my husband getting in the last word  on this occasion.        The next day my husband had an appointment with his  doctor, who is located next door to the vet.        The doctor's office was full of people waiting to see  him. A side door opened and in leaned the vet - he had  obviously seen my husband arrive. He looked straight  at my husband and in a loud voice said, "Your wife's  pussy is finally clean and shaved and she now smells  like a rose. Oh, and, by the way, I think she's  pregnant. God knows who the father is!" And he closed  the door.        Now THAT, my   friends, is getting even...

Experiment with each other in ways you havent and dont be afraid to try something new. Sex toys and role play are also another way to make sex "more fun". Having a significant other who has gained a little more weight then you had hoped has been an issue with couple for years.

But if he's all freaked out about you talking to someone; screw him.|`|AA12228671	Then dont be with him.|`|c7efcf49afc4d2d6531eb62d68b0f891aa	how long u been dating this guy? how old r u anyway? if you're stil young **** his *** go hang out with your friends and have fun instead of staying home and cry over his *** cuz he's probably out ******* another girl. I'm a guy so i know. a guy that cheat is the 1 that is insecure you feel me? if he doesn't have a girl on the side he wont be so jealous and insecure. thats just how it is. relationship is base on trust if you don't have that than its no relationship. so don't waste your time on his ***|`|431f49c5bdfbe8c9e9527468f61242e3aa	Well from the looks of it you sound very young, you have plenty of time to meet men there are a lot of them out there|`|5af1602d6d9933869adbe5be5c56e51faa	BE BRAVE AND TALK TO HIM AND TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT|`|4814b9709e0dc7089b526f7f7d85411eaa	well first off u sound young and confused. u have plenty of time for relationships.  right now u should be thinkin about havin fun with ur friends.  besides if he wont let u live life and wants to stop u from hangin with ur friends or family he's no good.  and a relationship without trust is not a good relationship.  i learned that the reason people don't trust their partner in a relationship is either cause their insecure of themselves and think ur gonna find better or casue they hidin somethin out in the streets and thinks ur gonna find out.  be safe and stay single.

AA11252231	I had never heard this term before too.  At first I thought it might refer to the Wends http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wends a Slavic people who from 600-900 lived in Germany between the Elbe and Order rivers.  But when looking for more information, I noticed point   3 on the wiki page.  So after another search, I came up with these two sites.  is your family from bethlehem PA? By any chance?  I hope this helps.     1) Pennsylvannia  http://www.enter.net/~stjohnwind/windish...    2) Hungary  http://www.wendishheritage.org.au/news/2...|`|AA11311741	It's Wendish.     Wends are from Germany and never had their own country.    The Wendish language is a Slavic type and related to the Czech, Slovak, and Polish languages.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wends

Now, if you would have told someone he was using drugs out of concern for his safety, that is one thing but that is not what happened.|`|aea7ebb710b41d76860c3c28c731d8b2aa	Turn him in, steal his drugs.

AA12274616	Sounds like she has had a lot to go through and needs time to deal with it all. When you go through that much in such a short time, you don't get to deal with each individual issue on it's own, they just kind of pile up on each other. Talk to her. See if she just needs time to come to terms with all she's been through.|`|5c5831974a0890205079c8f47bad4e17aa	well  maybe if i found out he was gay  then yes i would dump him.|`|216d4a77960317a9bfa4ffd2fff45afdaa	no he sounds like a keeper. wish there were more men out there like that. you be stupid if you gave him up.|`|AA11741176	maybe needed som time alone... i dont know i wouldent do da to him|`|8847185fb188cef67b038701781747b6aa	because if there is no love there... but for me I'll stand him as he stand by me...|`|a5a4a4f423948822c49fa0505d9a7b3faa	he maybe kind and thoughtful but maybe he's just not the guy for you. there is obviously something you dont like about him you may not relize it but yeah. its just not there.|`|AA11310429	i wouldn't dump him,he sounds like a great guy
