jBvKBrMEaa	Normally I would see nudists interjecting here, where are they when you need them? lol!    In our neo-Victorian culture, it is required that parents teach their children that any area of the body obliquely related to reproduction is "dirty" and must remain hidden at all times. Failure to do so puts your son at serious risk of feeling comfortable and confident in his own skin.    Our culture also sees it as important to re-enforce the idea that people lack self control, making situations like this one artificially awkward.. and generally just inciting riot among most YA commentors.    In heathen lands such as Brazil, France, and Japan it is common for families to bathe together regularly, fully nude, at all ages and in all genders.     But have no fear! You always have the option of severing your wonderful ritual. If you sprinkle in just enough backhanded comments about your son's physique at the same time, he will quickly catch up to his peers in feeling awkward and angstful about himself and how he is perceived by others. ^_^|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Your sis is right.  At 8 yrs of age he shouldn't be in the tub w/you.  While it's ok to tell him not to be ashamed of erections.  This is not place to have this talk naked w/him in tub.  If your son ever mentions this to someone o/s family they may report this to authorities.  You'd have some explaining to do.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	He's too old for it now. It doesn't make you a bad Mom though. Lots of kids take baths with their Moms, 8 is a bit old for a boy I think but I was 11 taking baths with my Mom and it was fun to have her wash my hair and clean my nails out. I do think you should stop now, but you shouldn't feel like a bad parent.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	I'm the mom of 3 boys and although I doubt you're a bad parent, he is a bit too old to be taking a bath with you.|`|uueuW6IHaa	I think what you said was the right thing... I remember being very embarrassed when that happened to me when i was young. but he is probably getting a little too old to see his mother naked. He will remember that and the fact that he got erections around you, and it could confuse him and cause him to be attracted to your body. Which would be a really confusing situation for a boy that age.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Kelly G said it perfectly. You don't sound like a bad parent, but 8 years old is too old for baths together, time to nip that in the bud.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You said the right thing, but you might consider stopping the mother/son bathtimes. Your boy is getting older, sad as it is to think he's not a baby anymore, and you both need to respect each other's privacy. Maybe instead of having baths together once a week you make a new mother/son special time. How about going swimming? You can both get some exercise and have fun together. Or, join a parent/child bowling league that meets once a week. Your son is obviously now becoming aware that he is different from you and expressing being bothered by it.|`|iEBrqir2aa	You sound like a good mom. I remember when I was a kid and I took baths with my brother, he would always get a huge ***** and it made me laugh. Its only natural|`|Ek0vvIE4aa	8 is way to old to be taking baths with mommy. my 8 yr old will never take a bath with my wife. 8 yr olds are at that age where they start having feelings and if your naked in the tub with him he sees that and his body is changing so you may be his mom but he also sees you naked. and im sure it embarrassed him he got a hard-on from his mom being naked. that gives him a very twisted idea on life.|`|8sFBxf6oaa	im sorry i was actually disgusted by your question.  your son is not little any more.|`|ijfCcyVIaa	You were absolutely right in making sure he isn't ashamed.  You should have said that to him.  On the other hand, he is WAY TOO OLD for baths with Mommy.  I  have to agree it is a bit disturbing.  Would you think it okay for an 8 year old girl to be having a bath with her Dad?   Bad judgement doesn't make you a bad parent.  Stop the baths.  It may be hard to admit, but he isn't a baby anymore.|`|T4t8rdTNaa	he's far too old to be bathing with you still, my sister does the same thing with her son who's turning 8 tomorrow, i've told her she shouldn't be several times but to each their own i guess...i think the age limit for bathing with your son is about 3-4 (just my rules)...what you said to him was perfect based on the situation but you should quit bathing with him

Definatly not Allegra though..!|`|cHEGf8Hcaa	I find Gabrielle the prettiest. I don't like the nickname of Gabby, though. I think the nickname Elle is sweet and the nickname Bree is gorgeous.
7bTOY5vHaa	I didn't have any braxton hicks with my first and had to be induced and with my second I had them all the time and still had to be induced. And they cant make you be induced, it's your body. And they are putting your baby at risk, inducing too early can have major risks.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Whoa. They actually TOLD YOU they wouldn't deliver your baby if you didn't agree to be induced? Tell them to @&%^ off. Wow. Perhaps this is an issue you can bring up with your state medical board, because if there's no medical reason for it and you don't want it, they CANNOT force you to do that just because they say so. That is ludicrous! You never know - call around and ask if someone else will see you - OR, if you want to take your chances, you can just show up at the hospital to be delivered when you go into labor. This is YOUR body and YOUR choice and really, if everything's going well, then there's no reason to force your body to do something it might not even be ready to do!     Anyway .. back to your original question - I had BH with all three of my pregnancies. I was dilated early with my first but he was breech and I had a section. With my second it was a VBAC and there was no dilatation or effacement at my last internal exam. This time I haven't been examined yet, but my doctor told me they usually get worse with each pregnancy and 'all that stuff about them not hurting' is BS. LOL They are a nuisance, I"ll say!    Anyway, good luck with the rest of your pregnancy. I really hope you can just ride it out and be left alone to let your baby finish growing in peace. Don't let them force you into something that you know in your heart is probably not even necessary. That's why typical pregnancies go 38-42 weeks - not on a doctor's timetable but on your baby's and your body's.     Good luck!|`|ROJans2Taa	I started getting really bad braxton hicks around 32 weeks, by 36 weeks they would make me double over, my stomach would get rock hard, my back felt like it was being torn apart, the day I got my membranes stripped (39 weeks) I was having them regularly about one every 15-20 mins, and they hurt bad, I went into labor right after she did the sweep, I had it done at 1pm I delivered at 7am the next morning, I really thought I was going to deliver around 37 weeks, but I held out till 39.|`|hoX7hoINaa	I'd like to know about this too. I've been experiencing Braxton Hicks since 28 weeks, so I'll be curious to see the answers. Sorry I can't provide anything else. I'm surprised they'd give you such a drastic option. Is it because of the Braxton Hicks?|`|GTCMey75aa	I bet you go into labour before that, I had braxton hicks all the time but I wasnt effaced at all and no dialation so I had to be induced at 39 weeks, but since your already effacing labour will most likely start for you. congrats

muTZeGOgaa	I've actually had 2 abortions, but they were by choice, not due to medical reasons. I had no problem with my decisions, because I did not want to carry the pregnancies to term. However, I can very easily see why you are feeling depressed. Being pregnant was something that made you happy. You wanted the child, but for reasons beyond your control you could not carry to term. It certainly is a sad thing for you if that is what you wanted.     I imagine you will come to terms with it in your own time. You'll probably go through most of the grief process before you do: Denial, Anger, bargaining, depressing, then acceptance.    If it becomes very bad for you, I suggest you talk with a counselor or something. Good luck. Just try to remember you did what you thought was best.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I personally haven't had an abortion. However my best friend went through one about 2 years ago, she was depressed about it. However she didn't let on exactly how she felt, we weren't talking or hanging out at the time [not by choice but by life changes].     When I got pregnant, and we would hang out, she re-lived the abortion every time. When my son was born she finally accepted the abortion, and moved on, but it took 1.5 years for her to fully understand.|`|m7GWaJflaa	I had an abortion and mine was just because i was stupid. The guilt and the pain was horrible. I was very depressed. It wasnt until i got pregnant again with my son that i felt joy in my life once again. If you feel ready, why not try again? ..And pray that this one will come out healthier.|`|s8Cbg73baa	Honey, it is almost impossible to get rid of the guilt and pain that comes from that decision. What is your religion? Being a Christian might help, even if not, talk to Christian therapists. You have to forgive yourself and just learn to live with it.|`|9xviGNWkaa	Think of it this way.. It was because of the risk of medical risks.. Although I don't know what you really mean by medical risks I am going to assume they would have effected your health? If you would have had the child think of what medical problems you may have had forces you not to be able to fully care for your child at the best of your ability. There for in the end they baby suffers.     However if the medical risks were for the baby than you were saving it of pain and suffering. Believe me watching a baby suffer is far more harder than having an abortion.     I have not had an abortion but recently did have a miscarriage and that was heartbreaking for me. Healing takes time. You will more on and you will heal it just takes time. You did what you had to do.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, i've not had one, but i can sort of relate to you because i had a miscarriage over a year ago, since you didn't choose to have the abortion, you needed to get it done i can understand how painful it must be for you.    I found in time after grieving it got better, of course it'll always be in my head and i'll never forget that baby or never stop thinking about what it would have been like, but i suppose these things happen and you've just got to get over them. I've never felt truly happy again until i fell pregnant with my son. I mean, i was happier after i'd gotten over the grieving process but i didn't feel complete, now i feel that.|`|2QGwjL7Caa	no i never had a abortion but i thought i was pregnant one day cause i started having these weird symptoms after bonging my best Friend on accident and was doing a lot of research on how to get one and wat was the affects, turns out i wasn't and my mom said we don't believe in it and i didn't know so yeah that would have sucked. i hope u feel better and ill pray for u. GOD BLESS!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	What do you mean by medical risks?  (just curiosity)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no ive never had one. but you will be in my prayers and i hope you get through this the best way you can.|`|Li09Gaqwaa	i was 6.5 weeks when i had my abortion. i feel terrible and i think it is half the reason i have a great fear of something happening to my current 18 month old daughter.  i felt so guilty and depressed it was terrible..i still think about it everyday! i got pregnant right after my abortion and i dont think i could do it again after going through that one. i always have bad dreams that my 18 month old got really ill or died or someone kidnapped her...i think the abortion before her might have had something to do with it! now im pregnant again! try to think more along the lines that your abortion was more for the health of you and your baby due to medical reasons. it wasnt just because you didnt "want" the baby! that might make you feel a little better! i wish i had someone to talk to about mine but no one knows! goodluck with coping and try your best!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes, my baby had spina bifida. I'm so sorry for your loss. The baby I had didn't have a chance, and what made me feel better was knowing that I should take folic acid everyday to prevent it from happening again and doing it, even though I wasn't trying to get pregnant. I feel like that baby may have saved its' sisters life in a way by showing the spina bifida on an US rather than dying before the ultrasound and me miscarrying. I did have a miscarriage before too, and I always wonder if my folic acid deficiency was the reason for it.
VClxXNs3aa	it means having the baby in your room at the hospital , but dont worry, if you put down that is what you want, and you decided while you are there you want the baby to go to the nursery, you can ask for the nurses to take him/her to the nursery and they will still do it.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It means the baby stays in your room at all times rather than staying in the nursery.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	That means you can have the baby be in your hospital room with you at all times. Some people prefer to have the baby room in the nursery. Personal preference.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It means that the baby sleeps with you in the same room. Not in the hospital nursery.|`|xGedX2rIaa	you can either have the baby in the nursury or in the room with you. (rooming in)|`|JsaEk8UAaa	It is asking if you want the baby to room in - stay with you or go to the nursery. I would room in because as nice as it is to get your rest - you want to see and hear your baby. You need to get used to your baby's schedule and cry. Congrats!!|`|PbPKSNlLaa	no sorry chick
Xngq54vBaa	I would go with the digital camera hunt... things like "two people with matching outfits" (they can either find two people wandering or have two people try something on)  "something that costs between $27 - $29" (they'd need a picture of the pricetag or a sign) "A sign that has your name on it" (if you have a common name, this could be found on keychains/stationary being sold in stores).      As for chaperones, as long as each group had a cell phone, I would think it would be okay for a group of girls (at least 3 in each group, maybe 4) to go by themselves for an hour and a half and then meet back (maybe at the food court or a coffee shop where your parents could be waiting) at a specific time.  Give the groups a two item penalty if they're late (that should make sure everyone's on time).  The winning group could each win a $10 mall gift certificate (or to a favorite store in the mall).  Then you could all eat and you open presents and everyone gets picked up from there.|`|MfIszBtZaa	Well, I'm not exactly sure what you want, but you could take a bus there. Then at the mall, you could do part of your hunt, eat food brought from home, and get back hunting.  some things you can hunt for are:  ? different stores  ? Certain landmark (sculpture, fountain, etc.)   ? Graffiti (if there is any)  You can also give each girl a few $ to buy something with. One other thing you can do is have them take pictures of each thing on a digital camera and show your parents to prove they found it.
PfLg9B6aaa	The hormones are insane trust me lol.  I would talk with him about it again but my hubby is gone for 6 months and in the beginning of everything us which was almost three years ago I was so worried because one my husband is super attractive and even to this day we will walk into a store and girls will still hit on him while we are holding hands and it drives me insane.  He doesn't do anything about it cause he loves me and I know I can trust him to not do anything.  Although he did look at porn one time and I went off on him and he hasn't since.  Yall are newly married and he just probably isn't used to not "getting any action" and has to have a last resort and you just need to tell him you don't like that and he needs to wait till he comes home.  Honestly your 17 weeks pregnant you do not need to be doing web cam bs.  That's so dumb and Im sure my hubby will want me to but I just can't do it.  It feels like Im trying to be a porn star or somethin lol.  It's like turning you husband on so he can satisfy himself but what do we get in return nothing.  Just wait for his reply and see how things go but I would make myself totally clear about everything to him if I was you.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	well first off i agree with your concerns if he will look at this girl while talking to you on a webcam is kinda rude and makes you wonder what he does when your NOT looking! im sure the hormones are making it seem a little more severe than it truly is. If he is getting mad at you for expressing your feelings than clearly he is doing someone wrong and feels guilty. I would try talking to him again and see where it goes or then you will have to decide if you will put up with it or leave whatever you choose good luck
wiAVa1H5aa	It can be, it's really if it goes up to an elevated temp and stays elevated.|`|aefb271af37a089fc25c8908176cce9caa	An increased temp. is a sign of ovulation.
se3RwEWyaa	You need at least 10mg of Progesterone to carry a safe pregnancy. I also similar issues w/ progesterone production. My RE prescribed 200mg of progesterone following my ovulation day. This will promote a safe preganacy if I do concieve. You can either get a suppository rectally or vaginally or in the form of a cream. I use a suppository and it is easy, just insert it before bedtime. Progesterone is very important here is why....    FYI: Progesterone dominates the post-ovulatory(luteal phase) of your cycle. Before ovulation, progesterone is present only in very small amounts. After ovulation (luteal phase), progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum (the remains of the ovarian follicle after ovulation), and is present in dramatically higher amounts. Progesterone plays the following roles:   Progesterone makes the lining of your uterus soft and spongy so that a fertilized egg can latch onto it and implant.   Progesterone is needed to support and sustain pregnancy.   Progesterone causes your Basal Body Temperature (BBT) to rise after ovulation so that it is measurable with a BBT thermometer.   Progesterone causes your BBT to stay elevated throughout pregnancy. Your Leutal Phase will last from confirmed Ovulation until conception or you AF begins. The rise progesterone levels marks confirmed Ovulation. Lots of luck and baby dust****|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	that could be why you keep miscarrying.     its easy to fix i suggest progesterone suppositories they work the best.     sorry for your losses.|`|ztzEloj5aa	have you been tested for a bicornuate uterus?

You should definitely pick a second name because that's  important.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	He might survive it if he always lives in Ireland but it wouldn't go down very well anywhere else.  It's so hard to say as well.|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Honestly I don't care for the name. But It is your child and you and you alone have the right to name your baby whatever you want. I do think he would be picked on my suggestion to you would to name him Moran Daithi, that way you are still incorporating his heritage to him.|`|cHEGf8Hcaa	I love the name. Will he grow up in Ireland? He'll come across problems if he doesn't... I know some people find that a huge issue. Personally, I don't think it's particularly difficult to tell someone how to say your name, or to make a tiny correction.    I found it hard picking a name, too. The middle names I have no problems with. Family members :o) perhaps you could use a family name or the name of a close friend for the middle?    Edit: Lovely :o) ha, I really do love that name. My closest friend is called Daithi. I think I've only ever known one other, and that was years ago. It's pretty uncommon, which is always a good thing.|`|kcrXrntnaa	i love Mischa for a girl, and i like that name for a boy, my little cousin is irish and he has the name Kieran David i personally think that name is adorable.=] good luck!

5rqVTOzmaa	Wow, the idea is interesting but I don't think I'd do it. Maybe you could just use one of the names? What about using another name signifying Winter? Heck, even use Winter. Fevrier Winter Granger or Winter Fevrier Granger sounds better.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	february february?    wow. thats more than tacky.    thats like, naming your kid january.  just stupid.|`|1en1Jtp4aa	i love it|`|yNuGrHsRaa	That's like naming your son    Aaden Aaden Granger    why do that?|`|bfjs9wSLaa	I hate those names!

February February is absolutely tacky.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	I think that name is really not pretty...in fact i don't like it. Sorry..that's just my opinion.

qsjGSXaRaa	That's pretty big but I think if your pediatrician says there's not a problem, then no need to worry.    I was worried that my little one weighing 14 pounds 13 ounces was too big but the doc says not to be concerned...she's doing just fine for a 3--month old.    Look at it this way...you have more baby to love!! :o)|`|8051092d1ee3157bc1cf451a31222966aa	My son is 15lbs|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	she was tiny stil is she was like 10 pounds|`|DnyyyGeEaa	my baby is 8 months and only 18lbs dont worry though all babies are different.

She is 90% for weight and 94% for height so my daughter is just growing so fast!  Plus when I was breastfeeding when she was first born, she never lost any weight so we were above the curve on that too!    Don't worry about it, she is healthy and the doctor will tell you if there is anything to worry about.
defa01a9b9b9e0647cc64a872e905a85aa	i think you should tell him. since you guys are over with i think you should definately tell him. just know that he might get a little upset and its miscarriage. lol     hope this helps!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	why tell him? its over and done with and it will just bring up negative emotions on both sides. im sorry about your loss.|`|RFPWEmhUaa	I wouldnt tell him now, its too late to. You should have told him when you were pregnant|`|4NQbNjxVaa	No I don't think so. Its over, its not like you got an abortion or anything that he should have been involved with. I think it will just cause more unneeded drama for you and him. If your mom knows you could talk to her for advice, but if not I would keep that to yourself for awhile.|`|gD86SIWeaa	probably not.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	Why are you having sex in grade 8 isn't that like 13 yrs old, if i knew my daughter was having sex and pregnant at 13 i would be really devastated, there is plenty of time for this sort of things when you get older.    To answer your question i would let bygones be bygones and just forget about it, sorry for your loss and if you are having sex maybe talk to someone to get on the pill to prevent this from happening again.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	If  you want to or maybe not. maybe it'll bring you guys closer together. is that what you want???|`|9P26sacKaa	I think you should tell him.  After all, you got the opportunity to learn the lesson that pregnancies can happen when a condom breaks... he should get that lesson too.  He needs to also think about the effects of having sex, even protected sex, and proceed accordingly.    Also, if I were you, I'd get one birth control.  After all, it's cheap and your parents don't need to know about it.  You can go to your regular doctor or a Planned Parenthood or something similar.  If you're going to be having sex, you should protect yourself from unwanted pregnancies.      Good luck and I hope the healing process from the miscarriage has treated you well.  I also hope you saw a doctor after you miscarried.  While your body certainly knows what it is doing and probably did everything right, there is a chance you could get an infection and there are things you're supposed to do to keep healthy and understand about healing and such.|`|2VMs4hRKaa	I would tell him and maybe that would be good for him so he knows what reality really is.|`|ztzEloj5aa	He is your ex. telling him wont make a difference It wont change anything. It wont make the baby come back and it probably wont make him like you again- it may just scare him away. espec. at your age... Sure it was his as well but i think its best to just leave it as is and not say anything.

There is an expectation that since your parents "gave you up for a better life" that you should have a lot of material possesions and be "well off".|`|AKJwWqdZaa	I don't know where you live, but I don't know of anyone who thinks the majority of adoptees were raised a la Paris Hilton.|`|Of7KEsnXaa	What?? Adopted ppl are supposed to have swimming pools and hot tubs??? WTF? I was gyped!!!!  Sadly my adopted daughter will also get gyped since I don't have the money to provide her with 2 pools, hot tubs and ponies....Her first mom's mother did send her a kiddie pool for her birthday last summer...guess she will have to settle for that.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I'm sorry but I have a very hard time believing that. I have never thought that was the typical adoptee and have never heard anyone in person claim such a thing. The only time I hear things like that are when people pose questions like this.|`|0jQcNWITaa	What are you talking about? How silly is a question about the adoption trolls? Makes you look a little silly too.|`|vwTyihvvaa	That is not what I think of when I think about someone being adopted.   However, it is a positive view, not negative.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	A lot of women that are preyed upon by agencies in developing countries are fed this by agencies...as well as being told they will join their children after a year or two.    Most of the women have never been out of their community or town, lack a formal education and don't know whats up.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I think people think that the people who adopt now are wealthy, because it costs so much to adopt a baby.   But when I was a kid, it did not. I was not thought of as rich. Quite the contrary, we were poor.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	I can't say I've ever heard that myself. I guess most people assume adoptive parents are middle class but never heard anyone expect me or other adoptees to have extremely wealthy parents.    Another thing thought is that a couple of times when I revealed I was adopted the first thing people said was "Oh, so you must have lovely, caring parents then". lol I'm not sure what they meant by that, perhaps for "saving" me. My parents ARE lovely but I know for a fact that adoptive parents are not always lovely, my first adoptive parents abused me before I was fostered out again as an infant. Lovely people they were!|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Jesus, anyone who would think that is ignorant.     ETA:  Actually I hardly think anyone would think that.  It would be pretty ridiculous.  That sounds more like someone who would be on "My Super Sweet 16".  I don't know if its because I'm adopted myself, but I never would assume that about anyone.  I assume that adoptees are just like everyone else as far as socio-economic status.  Some have more than others in the bank.|`|O1Sqcc5yaa	I never heard of any of that.  If I was asked, I would guess that they weren't poor, but that's only because it's easier for a rich family to adopt.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Do you have the vaguest idea as to what you are talking about? I doubt whether many others will have.    You haven't asked a question.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	I wasn't raised like that, I don't know of any other adoptee raised like that, and growing up, I was never asked why I didn't have a pool or a pony.  I wouldn't say most people think that way either.  I think anyone who thinks that not only has skewed views of adoption but is out of touch with reality in general.  Trolls, I think, know this and are just looking for a response to keep themselves amused.
AA10526033	talk to your dr. its way to early for food plus pretty early for even cereal. lots have changed since we were babies. cereal in bottles is a big nono at any time unless reccommended by a dr.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Not until she's 6 months old!   No rice no nothing except your milk right now, it's not good for her to have anything else unless you want to give her formula.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	Stop feeding her anything but breastmilk/formula!!!! Exposing your child to cereal and other solids this young can cause a myriad of problems, such as celiac disease, food allergies, decreased cognitive ability and decreased immunities.

There have been many studies done to back this up - you don't have take it from me or others here, ask your pediatrician to show you.|`|ND7BY6jkaa	My doctor said not to give my 4 month old anything but breastmilk until 6 months of age.

VQzYYYaEaa	No one could answer that.  It'll come on her own time.  Girls under the age of 10 are a lot more trusting and less jugmental.  11 and 12 year olds might think before trusting.    The adopted father should know that he should never force himself on her if she wants to be left alone by him.

Sit down and talk to your dad about how you feel.  Be sure to stay calm and don't accuse him.. Use words like, "When this happens, I feel sad.." not "You guys always treat me like crap."  Maybe he'll be willing to modify his behavior and talk to his wife about how she treats you as well.  If not, at least you'll have proved that you can behave like an adult, even though he can't.  And, maybe talk to your mom and she can try to talk to him as well, or make it so you can maybe move in with her instead.    Hope things get better.
jdRKZe18aa	That's a tough balance to find these days.  So much awful stuff in the world and in society, at school, in media, video games, public etc... where exactly to draw the line between sheltering enough but not too much is hard and a very individual & personal choice I think.     I think sheltering our kids while they are still YOUNG and you CAN shelter them is important.  Preschoolers, elementary schoolers - THEY need protection, sheltering because they are young, innocent, lacking in knowledge and worldly experience (hopefully) and aren't emotionally equipt to make proper and wise choices when faced with some of the CRAP in "the world".....      BUT as they grow up a little I think letting go a little at a time as they show they can handle responsibility well, as they show they can make good choices, pick good friends, have gained your trust, take responsibility for their actions, show appropriate judgment and recognize that they are NOT indestructible... little by little giving them more and more freedom, but still hanging on to the parental place with guidelines and rules & expectations and consequences too.... that helps them learn & grow up to be responsible members of society and the world.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Children have to learn about real life. Sheltering will not help this.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Depends on what kind of sheltering you`re referring to. I`m thinking of coddling. I`m thinking of a incident when a child does something wrong and a parent constantly apologizes for the child rather than the child owning up to it and apologizing themselves. I think children today need to take a little more responsibility for their actions, the parents should step aside for a second and let the kids learn.|`|zZ6wjO6Maa	My mum bubble wrapped me when i lived at home, when i moved out (2003 - aged 18)and moved in with my husband i found it difficult to juggle moving out, a uni course, marriage, getting robbed 5 x in a year, living above heroin addicts, depression, birth of our daughter etc - i couldn't deal with it all and ended up quitting my course due to stress. I had no concept of living in the real world and if i had been allowed more freedom maybe i could have dealt better emotionally.  I still don't handle the financial area of our life, my husband does because i panic and stress out.|`|AA12221392	This is a tough one for sure. I have been one of these parents that have sheltered my kids alot but it was due to situtations that happened that scared me , and made me scared for my kids.     I did take it overboard, and had to learn this the hard way as my kids got older. They were taught to fear alot of things. They know reality, I mean the real world stuff, but was very sheltered from a lot of other stuff.     Yes, it can hurt kids if you don't  keep a balance, and I have to admit in todays world that I think a lot of parents struggle with that.
FmC1TGm5aa	I use limewire (limewire.com I think).

Good luck and your cousin is so lucky to have you!|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	Two to three months prem isn't that bad these days. You'd be amazed when you see many of these kids a year down the line and they have almost caught up with their full-term peers. Of course, it's natural that your cousin doesn't want to feel positive because all she sees is her wee baby in an incubator with no end in sight.    I'd respect her wishes although perhaps you could buy a gift, such as a photo album, to give the second she does start to feel more positive. This way, she can start to fill the album with pictures of the baby on her road to recovery. It's not only a good memento for the child when she's an adult but your cousin can look back to see how far the baby has come.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes buy a cute outfit like for summer o to 3 months|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I think you should respect your cousin's wishes and wait. Your presence and support are the best gift for both mom and baby right now. When mom is more comfortable with the idea, you can lavish the little one with gifts. Stay hopeful...medicine has come a long way, and many premature babies go on to thrive and grow into healthy children. Best of luck.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	This is a very scary time for your cousin. Be there for her!!! Encourage her that when this little one is home and she has a chance to get a groove going that she will be having a baby shower. Till then give her something that she can hold on to that is for her baby. If by chance the baby does pass she could keep this item and find comfort. If you don't want to get her crying you could get her a cute card and gas card. Good luck!!!|`|vOTcVMsdaa	I personally wouldn't get anything for the baby. If she really is concerned, and you buy the baby stuff, then if (God forbid) something does happen to the baby, it would kill her to have to get rid of it. It's not worth it.    If you are visiting the mother at the hospital why don't you get something for the mother instead? A journal, or a book about hope.    Something like that.  The baby is in my prayers!!|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	A  friend had a baby born at 26 weeks 4 days . (she is now a happy health 22 month old) I gave her a hand knit baby blanket to put over the incubator to make it darker for baby and a little stuffed animal that they used to show how small the baby was and every week they took a photo of baby with the stuffed animal to show how much she had grown and the rest of the time it sat on her incubator.   I though that if the baby didn't make then mom would have something that was babies.   You could also give mom a gift certificate to a restaurant close to the hospital so she can go get something to eat and still not be far from the hospital.  If she has other children you could offer to baby sit so she can be at the hospital or make a few meals and freeze them so she can just heat them up      My friend did not feel like cooking after visiting the baby so she found it easy for her or hubby to heat frozen meals.     I wish you cousin and her baby all the best|`|2ca74edffa365c5d4c02e430c41c5456aa	If she said she doesn't want anything, don't get anything yet.|`|igJJ37Tjaa	If they are or maybe not religious, how about a prayer printed out that you can hang in her room or on her crib.  This may help the family with support and positive feelings.    Your cousin should keep her chin up, it is amazing what doctors can do these days.|`|Yba724Wkaa	Respect her wishes about baby gifts. Try getting her a guardain angel or a really nice card. Take her a cup of coffee or lunch. Best of luck and best wishes to the baby!
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it could be sign of conception, ovulation. sign that period could be coming.    since you said period had finished couple days after having sex. Most likely it is your ovulation date.  The vaginal discharge would happen maybe after conception or few days before period is due. also during pregnancy it increases so its hard to tell. it could be or might not be,  Conception occurs 5 days after ovulation (approx).  Blood test is accurate within one week of ovulation.  God B less x|`|k9nLue0Uaa	yes and no it can happen at any time.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Vaginal discharge is normal at anytime, not just at times of pregnancy.
L7uz5Xmzaa	Yes. it only takes one "Fishie" to make a baby.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	if she is 1 month late then get a test|`|9hrJfhIIaa	No.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Very unlikely, but she might want to test if she's 1 month late.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	not by a hand job...|`|GdSzrtmAaa	If she is a month late than she should take the test.|`|98WKYtfwaa	If she was in the bath naked when the ejaculation went in, then it's possible, extremely rare but possible.     She should take a test if not then see a doctor, she shouldn't be missing her period without reason.
j65rSZ26aa	no they either ask you to turn it off or don't bring one at all. It's just like an airplane it interferes with the equipment|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	no...|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I found out a year or so ago that it's the older cell phones that cause interference with machines.   I wouldn't risk it. If a babies machine went haywire because of my phone I would feel so responsible and wouldn't be able to look at myself.|`|AA10526033	most hospitals let you now but i know here no cell phones in nicu due to all the machines right there plus it needs to be kind of quiet and really just doesnt seem like a good idea too me.|`|YfTk9f56aa	You are prohibited to tak your mobile/cell phone into any NICU/SCBU/Neontal ward in most countries as it intefers with the equipment that is being used for your baby.  The signal can cause the alarms to sound as the equipment is sensitive to many things.  Also, other than the sensitivity, it is the noise of the phone and the flash from the camera's that startle the baby and cause unwanted reactions.    This really is one rule that you should stick by as you wouldn't want to put your baby at risk.
n6XYYyoLaa	i think she drank around four oz every three to four hours at that point...some are hungrier than others though, so u may have to play around with it; and some babies, contrary to what many will say, will overeat if they have a strong urge to suck...usually u figure this out bc they will spew a decent amt after feeding on a large amt...my dd did this so what we did was give her her reg amt...give her a passy ; if she was still hungry she spat it right back out, but if she wasn't she would suck away on the passy until she got enough and then she spat it out...it's worth a try if u need it....and passys now supp decrease sids if they sleep with them....i do not stick it in every time she makes a peep though; the only other time she usually takes a passy is for sleep or when she isn't feeling that great....gl, hth|`|q8tUfflyaa	My daughter eats 6-9 ounces every 2 hours to every 3.5 ours.

wIGuhAZXaa	Rosalie I think this name is so pretty|`|ZW5VILdCaa	Rosalie|`|U1juqahIaa	I prefer Rosalie, but with the insane popularity of Twilight (Which I can't stand), I'd prefer it as a middle name.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Rose! =)|`|Xxrt7PTXaa	Definitely name her Rosalie. You can always call her "Rose" for short, but you still have the longer "Rosalie" to fall back on.|`|xpUyH0psaa	rosalie|`|CxRJwJsraa	I like both. I think I prefer Rosalie slightly more though (mostly because then Rose could still be a nic).    However I much prefer Rosabel or Rosaline to either of those.|`|aNMZHg0qaa	rose- it's just pretty|`|kcrXrntnaa	either, but i personally like Rosalie the best.=] good luck!|`|hqyAVid7aa	Rosalie.|`|S17bl9wZaa	ROSALIE!!!|`|Zcb77wIZaa	ROSALIE BUT ROSE FOR SHORT SO U CAN HAVE BOTH   HOPE I HELPED|`|cHEGf8Hcaa	Rosalie is an absolutely beautiful name. I really love it. It could be shortened to Rose, too, so you get the best of both :o)  I also love Rose, but I prefer it in the middle name slot.|`|9CsIlooXaa	They sound old|`|8u5DUE5Iaa	Rosalie-you can still call her Rose|`|QltAdQ2kaa	keep rosalie and when shes older she can choose to have rose as a nickname from rosalie :D but they are both really pretty|`|5DK546BUaa	Rose!    While I like some of the variants - there is a lot to be said for the original... Rose is simple, sweet, and would be a name that future generations might consider passing down to their children :)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Rose|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You could have both    Name her Rosalie and call her Rose|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Rose.  I'm not really a fan of either, but Rosalie sounds too frilly, in my opinion. I prefer Rosamund or Rosaline, they have a more strength.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Rosalie is my favorite. I love Rose as well, but not as much as Rosalie! I love Rosalie, it's in my top 5 (Miranda, Cordelia, Violet, Alice, and Rosalie!)|`|xGedX2rIaa	rosalie for a first name  rose for a middle name

ocNUYENRaa	Before my second son was born I talked to my son about all the things he can do that the baby can't. I told him how much the baby loved him and couldn't wait to meet him. The baby even "talked" to him from my womb. :-)   We haven't had too many issues since Brendan has been born. A few "please put him down". I try to respect his feelings as much as I can. He's been my one and only for 2 1/2 years and it must be hard for him to have to share me.     Try having a big sister party. See if grandparents and maybe a friend or two can come a visit and bring small tokens, say a $5 limit. Also, try getting a gift from your daughter from the baby too. She will be jealous, that's to be expected. Just respect that instead of putting her off and try to foster a good relationship between the two of them.    Oh, as for the clothes - can you show her some of her baby clothes? Go through pictures of her when she was a baby, talk about how she used to have breastmilk/bottle and now she's so big she doesn't need that stuff.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Jasey used to be the center of your attention and now she's been dethroned by your newborn. She doesn't like that she has to share you with him and is afraid that you'll abandon her for him and so pushes him away or punish him. She also punishing you because you're not giving her attention you used to. Jasey needs to move from being an individual child to being a sister.    You'll need to find different ways of showing and reassuring Jasey that you'll be there for her both by spending time with her and by introducing her to her brother in such a way that they bond and be affirmed by you. She needs to see that there's plenty of love for both. While the two of them are together, you can give your attention to Jasey and show your approval for her, especially if she does something nice for her brother.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	You should try spending more time with her. Are you still with ur boy friend?|`|zy9XbvSraa	If its her dad than let here meet him ! just put the clothes in a taped box|`|jbxUtJRDaa	wow! just keep trying to spend time with her and remind her that you love her, ESPECIALLY when the baby comes! she probably thinks that you are going to not love her as much as you love the new baby... spending time with her is very very important.|`|pPJcg5GGaa	all you can do is talk to your daughter about how fun it will be to have a younger brother and how she can do fun things like feed him his bottle help you dress him change him.Maybe even let her help pick a name with you just reasure her she wont be left out by mum or dad and she should be fine hope this helps.|`|gZoljE7Saa	The best thing is to be very positive with her. Give her a lot of praises for all the good things that she does and try to read books on how much fun it is to be a big sister and talk about how she will get to teach the baby all the fun things about being a kid.  good luck.  ps we have the same due date.  i have a two year old girl|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	Well, as much as she protests theres nothig she can really do about it is there lol  Just tell her that the baby is coming whether she likes it or not and try emphasise how great and grown up it will be to be a big sister.    also, did you need all the capital letters?!
UJaCObdyaa	I have loved Memphis for a boy since I first saw "Gone in 60 seconds".  I think it is an absolutely adorable name.  If I had more kids I would definitely use it.|`|hucsWXhgaa	its not bad personally i like dakota|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Memphis reminds me of Mumble's dad from Happy Feet, or of a big, burly country singer.|`|evEYVoqMaa	no you can call him alexander|`|B2vFQLU0aa	It's good!|`|0b2WSgpfaa	I really don't want to be rude, but Memphis makes me think of a penguin. You know, from Happy Feet. Mumble's dad.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I don't know, I am not big on place names. Maybe you could use it for a middle name, pairing it with a really strong first name. For example you could use, Joshua Memphis or something like that. Just use another name you really like, if you aren't sure about Memphis as a first name.|`|Xxrt7PTXaa	It has a bit of "country bumpkin" sound to it. Plus the nickname might end up being "Mem," which sounds odd.    Is "Dallas" too common for you? Sounds stronger.|`|f4d85845a950087316840c62c9b31c06aa	I don't like it|`|hqyAVid7aa	No, just no. If someone named their kid that..He WOULD be made fun of. "Oh you are named after a city..HAHAHAHA."      I know lots of good names..What letter(s) would you want it to start with?|`|aNMZHg0qaa	I agree with Layys    Naming your kid after a place isn't a good idea in my opinion.|`|uwd425eTaa	I like it, it's a little different without being overly unique. And as far as the people commenting about it being a location name, there are lots of people named Dallas, Paris, etc who don't seem to have a problem with it. :-)    Congrats!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Memphis is okay  I like it better than Bronx or Boston|`|XzV4bUeFaa	No.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Thats cool.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	i don't like that name at all but try these names:    Dylan  Daniel  Dave  Stephen  Mike  Rob    try these names! hope i helped!|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Memphis is a female character in mythology. According to legend, she and her husband Epaphus founded the city of Memphis in Egypt.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_(my...

If it has been within 72 hours you can get the morning after pill from your doctor, but if it's been longer than that then all you can do is wait.

l46COY9eaa	Hi! I am a little overweight too, I am like you, we are what is called a "pear" shape, rather than an "apple shape", because the majority of our weight is carried in the hips and thighs. From what I keep reading, pear shaped women tend to be a little more fertile than apple shapes, but as I have been ttc forever, it don't ring true to me. Here is something I found:    "Pear shaped women may also be more fertile than their apple shaped friends due to higher levels of the hormone oestrogen. However a conflicting view is that the higher level of oestrogen may lead to an increased risk of endometriosis, which in turn may make conceiving problematic."    http://www.uniquelywoman.co.uk/women's_a...    and.....    "Some studies have suggested this body shape can have its benefits too.  Researchers at Harvard University in the US found that curvy women were more likely to get pregnant as they have higher hormone levels than other women, which boosted their fertility.  It was suggested this could be the reason why the hourglass figure was traditionally viewed by men as being the ideal body shape. And it's not just fertility it helps with."  http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/h...    There are a bunch of other articles on body shape and fertility, and most of them say the pear or hourglass figure is the ideal, and most fertile of the shapes.    Hope I helped!  :)|`|6igjX2cnaa	Hey hun... well it's different for everyone.  I have a pear shape with my bottom half (hips, thighs, butt) holding most of my weight and my torso is smaller and narrow.  An apple shape, is the more weight in the torso and upper body (so rounder up top like an apple).  An hour glass would be a person who is equally heavy in the chest and hips and narrow in the waist (like an hour glass).  I'm about 10lbs overweight.  I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome though.  I'm the minority of peeps with pcos, cuz I'm not obese and I don't have Insulin Resistance (which a lot of pcos girls do).      I thought the same thing in the past about weight distribution, but fertility wise, I'm still ttc.  I'm currently seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist though.  That body shape IS healthier for your internal organs and does lower your risk for diseases such as diabetes since the weight isn't centered around major organs.  Best wishes hun! I hope you conceive with no prob :)
e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Dont worry about it.  Let her tell you when she is done eating.  The formula or breastmilk you are giving her has all the things in it that she needs.  If she doesnt seem interested then dont feed her the cereal during that feeding and try again later.|`|JP2h62qiaa	She may not like the texture. My son liked it thick. REALLY thick like chuncky creme of wheat.       She also has a TINY tummy so if she has already had a bottle then she may be full.

If they don't want to have cereal some days , don't force it , it will make eating a negative thing and u will have more problems introducing new foods . Your doing the right thing ..

She may be full...did you feed her a bottle before giving her the cereal?? I would try her on the cereal before any formula is givin and its only day 3 so she may just need to get used to it.

SEzIkGNiaa	I babysit and I charge 5 dollars per hour for 2 children.  Adding an extra 1.50 for more than 2 child per kid.  I also charge a flat rate of 50 dollars per day (8hours+).    Good Luck!|`|Irm5gynTaa	well, i am a babysitter and babysit one little girl,   monday-friday 8:30am-5:30pm  and get paid $85 a week ( and I include lunch )      but, sometimes she doesn't pay me at all, or doesn't even show up.  or she'll give me $40 and thinks that will cover it.  so, I really need a different job.  i'm just so attached to the little girl, and know her mom is having a tough time right now.|`|EvIok3G2aa	i babysit and everyone i babysit give me at least $10 an hour. if they have more kids they usually give me like $12ish|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	Well. I pay my baby sitter 5 dollars a hour. And i think thats fair. 10 is way to much, and 3 or 4 isn't enough.   Goodl uck!|`|2xS1Jro7aa	It depends if your just going to watch them every now and then like a few hours once every few weekends or daily. I watch 4 kids daily and I get paid about $2 an hour per kid. But when I baby sit someones kid on a rare occasion and for like 2-3 hours they usualy pay $10 an hour. It really depends on where you live and the parents. If you need to know some fun things to do with kids or snacks/meals to make send me an email i would be more then happy to help you! I have been baby sitting for a very long time and worked in a daycare for 3 years! My email is jj_06_07_08@yahoo.com|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I think right at $7 an hour is good.     People here often times say 10-15 or more, but I think that is plain ridiculous.     I work in a daycare and watch over 10 kids at one time, and I get 9/hour and that includes setting up and cleaning as well. No way someone watching 2 kids in someone's home should get more money than I get working in a daycare.     $7/hour is good for a teenaged baby-sitter...it's more than they will get working at the grocery store or mall.      and on a sidenote...Chels...I would dump that family, even though you are crazy about the kids. I used to work for this one family that sometimes paid me $3 an hour and sometimes paid me $8/ hour....and then sometimes they wouldn't pay me at all and say they'd pay me next time for that time and they never did. I was in love with the kids as well...but they were walking all over me. When I told them I couldn't sit for their kids anymore, I felt SO much better!|`|3a6ed065e093beae9e062c7243b2e653aa	my neice baby sits for our friends and they give her 20-30 pounds for few hours one saturday evening a month
2xS1Jro7aa	When I used to baby sit in other peoples homes I would always clean up the house when the kids were sleeping and so on. I never said anything about how I cleaned up but they always commented and thanked me for it and even paid me a little more. I would vacuum do the dishes that were in the sink clean up all the toys and put everything away so it looked nice and clean. I do not think anyone would be offended unless you made a big deal or said something to them. I am sure they will be happy that you clean!|`|jdRKZe18aa	DEFINATELY A PLUS and would make a parent want you back  BIG TIME.  If a BBsitter didn't clean up - she would NOT Be asked back at my home!|`|UUpsa35Daa	When i baby sit i always use the time when the kid/s are napping or watching a movie to clean up. If they're big enough i'll have them help with toys but otherwise i'll do it. I wash the dishes, wipe the counters, put any food we had away...just any of the little things that i see out of place i'll put back.    I see it as, i'm babysitting for a reason...either the parents are working or they needed some time to themselves. Either way, they won't want to have to come home and clean.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I don't think it's offensive unless she makes a big deal out of it, which it doesn't sound like she is.     I babysit and every day, after the kids go to sleep, I clean up any of their food and store it properly in the fridge, etc. I also clean up the counters if something's out and I know where it goes. It's no big deal to me. I usually tidy up their entire living room as well because that's where we spend most of our time while I'm there and the kids usually move around their beanbag chairs and the ottoman and bring blankets and throw them all around. I sort that all out and also pick up any toys.     I think the parent's would be appreciative of having their house tidied. I also feel that I should do something while the kids are asleep and I'm getting paid to be there other than watching tv or something.|`|Irm5gynTaa	I'm a baby sitter, and whenever I use to watch the little girl at their house I always cleaned up after myself and the child, or just straightened up the little girls room or living room.  I wouldn't think of it as insulting, I'm just trying to be helpful as i'm sure your sitter is especially since she is your friend.  think of it as paying for a babysitter, getting a nanny for free.  because really, that's the job description of a nanny, and they are expected to receive a different pay.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	I would be thrilled if she cleaned up something for me that she didn't make, now if she was doing my laundry and vacuuming my floors...that would be strange, but i wouldn't just fire her for her, i would probably pay her a bit more. I would just say, "hey please, i dont want you to be my maid!" But i would so ask her back, i mean you are coming home to a clean house with happy kids, what more can you ask for?|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I'd want her back.   I used to be like that...I still am kind of.   I am a neat freak. I cannot sit in a place and know there is a sink full of dishes, or the garbage is overflowing and I'm sitting here watching a movie.   I happened to babysit for families that had cleanliness issues though, and even at 14 I would clean it.   I don't like coming home from work with the dinner dishes from last night still sitting there, and I know the families that I babysat for appreciated it.   I spent more time there than they did most weeks.   It also can turn into extra money for the babysitter. I would get "hired" to clean peoples houses and they in turn would let their friends know.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	If she babysat for me, I'd definitely ask her back.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	I love the babysitters who clean up the house....Beyond the messes that they have made!  I'll even pay more!!
aZwaCKgdaa	Here is my honest answer.  Please know that I am not trying to be mean.  You have stated in previous posts that you are 17, do not have many friends, do not live in your parents home, and believe you are in love.  After reading through some of your other questions or answers, I suspect that you want a baby because you think that the baby will always be there to love you.  Perhaps you are hoping that a baby will "seal" your relationship with your boyfriend.  Perhaps you think a baby with mend your relationship with your family.  Please know that NONE of these are good reasons to have a baby.      You know it is not the right time, please, please, please stop trying to get pregnant right now and go back on the shot.      I had my first child relatively young (21) and times were very, very hard.  Know that adding a child into a relationship causes stress and can damage it unless you are both really ready for a child.      I will not say being a young mother is the worst thing in the world -- there are some really good young mothers out there.  Unfortunately, there are just as many, or more, young mothers who were completely unprepared for the responsibility and do not do a good job.     Reading through your previous posts, it is clear to me that you are not ready for a baby.  They keep you up all night, cover you in mucousy spit-up and snot, require constant attention, and make life incredibly difficult.      Please think carefully about this -- and in the meanwhile, go get the shot again.|`|AA10948829	1. You're 17. Don't get pregnant.    2. You feel unloved and think that having a child will make your life exciting, fun, and that there will always be someone there for you who will love you unconditionally and always.    3. Get back on the shot. Do NOT get pregnant yet.|`|hYohgOcAaa	maybe ur lonely or maybe ur motherly stuff is starting to sink in  or maybe its b/c u see them everywhere n feel the need to have one   id really know baby's aren't that great especially the diaper part|`|gFiRi5xnaa	You got baby fever, I got that right before I got pregnant. To try and take my mind of having a baby, at least the part about actually having one myself, I got some little clothes and free diaper samples and stuff like that, it really helped being able to hold stuff that babies use.  Take your time, talk it over with your husband, and when y'all are ready, you'll know.|`|gkFOTg4Yaa	It's a nurturing instinct. My wife got that just after she got pregnant with our first child. It's a hormonal thing. Get a soft, cuddly pet. We got guinea pigs and it did the trick until the baby came along. Don't get pregnant. I'm guessing that you are very young. You have plenty of time for that.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	How old are you?  If you want a baby you should be financially stable and settled down in a place of your own, If you dont have these things you should not try for a baby until you do!      & if you dont want people saying things on here because it upsets you than you should not be on here cuz there are some rude people.

j65rSZ26aa	Well it's not supposed to smell like roses. I would be concerned if it was an odd texture/odor than what is normal for her. You would have to be more specific.

You need to add more details to your question.
C55pji5Qaa	It will be absorbed and in most cases the other baby will be just fine.Later in pregnancy, if their is a fetal demise they will keep the baby in until delivery of the other twin.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	i dont know. maybe leave him/her there????|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Your body will break down the embryo and absorb the products of conception.
qsjGSXaRaa	It's hard to say, if you're using "cheapy" tests.    I'd recommend the EPT  "early pregnancy test" brand. I took a pregnancy test during the week justBEFORE my period was due because I'd suspected I was pregnant....and I was!     I hope you get the answer you're looking for! Good Luck!|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	You could be pregnant.!!!  My Doc told me to wait a week after my skipped period to take a test.  Some pregnancy tests do not detect the amount of hcg that they say they can on the box even if they are the same brand, or even an early pregnancy test.  Waiting a week after your skipped period will allow the hcg to build up...it doubles every 2 to 3 days when you are pregnant.  It looks like you are experiencing pregnancy symptoms and since you are saying your period is 3 days late, I would go ahead and test this weekend!!!  Lots of luck and Baby Dust!!!|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	I would wait at least another week! Good Luck!!!|`|zy9XbvSraa	1 week|`|k6C7qXTuaa	This has happened to me a million times and im not pregnant yet im sorry to say.

BUI9HnH1aa	a friend of mine breast fed till her milk came in , then exclusively pumped and feed her bub expressed milk for 9 months , it became to much of a hassle for her to keep pumping  all day., so she gave in and gave bub formula .   I can never really get the hang of pumping , lol, and only manage to get about 5 oz a day ! ,   So  if it works for you , then i don' tsee a problem|`|n6XYYyoLaa	as long as u produce enough; remember a pump is not as efficient at emptying the breast as baby is, so u may have to pump quite a bit for the supply/demand to be met...gl, hope it works out for you...oh, and i have heard that the hospital grade pumps are best...|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My first baby was in the NICU for awhile and i pumped for him for 4months and then switched to formula. But i didnt switch to formula because of not enough milk...it was just tiring pumping all the time. It can be done but you have to pump all the time...i was pumping every 2hours.|`|igJJ37Tjaa	I have heard that you need to breastfeed and pump.  Just pumping will eventually dry you up, but of course everyone is different!|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Pumping is not easy. Breastfeeding isn't easy wither.   I found pumping much harder to do. Many women can't keep up with pumping alone and end up having issues quickly.   It is possible though.   A pump will never be able to produce as much milk as baby will.|`|ytE1q20taa	Yes it is, it's what I'm going to be doing.  You will have to feed directly from the breast until the proper milk comes but the you can start using a pump and bottles when it does.  Good luck and congratulations.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Yeah if you want to. It's the same milk, just in a different container.|`|7Tcfc3Plaa	yes if you dont wanta breast feed its completly fine to pump it and put it in a bottle and bottle feed him...its the mothers choice|`|XSol0H6Uaa	Sure why not?? It's better than formula.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	I would breastfeed for a while at least.  If you nursed for 21 months, you are aware that it is more than just nutritional, it is about the security and bonding, as well.      But, I agree with the person above...I have heard that pumping alone will dry you up.  Also, you are less motivated to continue breastfeeding if you pump exclusively.    Breastmilk is best though...and I completely support you if this is your decision!  At least you are trying!!!!
NoUkTQCgaa	I know a man who donated sperm when he was in college. He said at the time, he did not think of the consequences, he just did it for the cash. He regrets it now, and has registered with a donor search site in case he actually did create a child.      My N Brother has a friend who found out she was a donor child. She was devestated when she found out, but was not at all surprised, as she looked nothing like her father.      Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get info from the particular sperm bank her mother used.  They claim her records were destroyed in a fire.    I think its interesting how most BSE adoptees have come of age and are now searching, and now, the sperm donor kids are beginning to search too. They have it worse than traditional adoptees do, as far as searching goes, as many sperm banks were not required to keep records. This particular woman belongs to a support grop in California, and said that several members of the group were from the same sperm bank, had DNA tests performed, and were found to be 1/2 siblings. Talk about creepy...|`|FXns08Tcaa	that is just ****** up|`|6orvPrLLaa	my ex-boyfriend donated sperm as a med student. he was given about $100/per...deposit; because he fit the criteria many like:    1) 6'2"  2) anglo-saxon (german)  3) intelligent (he was a med student, now neurosurgeon in maine)  4) very handsome    -------------------------------    anyway, he and i spoke about it maybe 3 years ago when we met up for a friend's wedding. he has never been married, wants children and feels horrible that he might have kids out there that he'll never know.    but that's another *hook* of the baby-industry: get broke college students with good genes and pay them for their sperm and eggs. nobody thinks about the human toll this has on people.|`|vwTyihvvaa	If my biological father happened to be a sperm donor, I would have a lot of negative feelings, not knowing.
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Just tell him NO. Let him know you are not ready to get pregnant, which could happen.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, you tell him that if he wants to support you and this future child for the next 18 years, then go ahead. Otherwise run, run away! from this man. If you're afraid of upsetting him then he's probably not worth being with anyway.     How long have you been with him? I can't think of any reason, other than wanting to have a baby, that someone would want to do this on purpose - and it sounds fishy to me. Are you sure he's STD free? Some sickos will intentionally spread it to their partners without telling them. I hope this is not the case!    Tell him you don't want to, and if he even remotely objects, then leave. Get out while you can before you end up pregnant and he leaves you anyway!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    You need to tell him straight out no!.  because it is more of a risk :   no pills   no protection.  pregnancy can occur. Even when on birthcontrol darling,    Say to him. im not ready for no protection. i love you. But having unprotected sex doesnt change anything about protected. To the way i feel about you.  im sorry but if you arent ready for me to have a baby then no.  because im not ready.    Always put yourself first before him.  God bless|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	You're boyfriend is an idiot. Don't you go and be one too.|`|FIG58FVpaa	Say no. If you're not ready and you're not using another form of protection/birth control, the risks are too high.|`|Qojl2upQaa	tell him NO.  If he really cared about you then he wouldnt put you at risk to get pregnant.|`|QSodlfMraa	ask him if he can take of a child? if he said no tell him no to unprotected sex.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Tell him to get a life.|`|7I3eG1lyaa	SAY NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. very bad idea on his part.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Ask him if he wants to be a daddy. That should cure it.|`|HFKr2vBsaa	It's much more enjoyable for them to not use condoms but for your sake, don't even give in. If he keeps on, then he's not really caring about what happens to you.  Just say no in a nice way and stick to your guns.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Let him know you would not have sex with him if he doesn't use protection. Is that simple!|`|Un511PNWaa	there are WAY more things you should worry about then pregnancy.    you need to worry about HIV (he might not have it)    and all the STI's|`|op4gBJRJaa	No, say i'll only have protected sex with you|`|07d2086aa27d1ba3ef711ade9372b259aa	Well if honesty doesn't work and you still want to be with his dumb ***, then go on the pill. If you hide them he'll never know. Good luck with that charmer.|`|PbPKSNlLaa	Okay so tell him how you feel be completely honest with him and tell him how your not ready for a kidd and im shure he will come around and agree with you..|`|1dVrFHctaa	You are in charge of your body, if you're not comfortable then don't do it. Don't under any circumstances let him pressure you. Guys sometimes think with their you-know-what, and haven't fully weighed up the consequences. But here are some options:  Option 1 - Tell him he's an idiot   Option 2 - Tell him if he wants to be a father then sure... why not.  Option 3 - Go on the pill  Option 4 - Catch a STD from him... You never know...  Option 5 - Tell him you have a rare STD that he could catch if you have unprotected sex and if you do his tackle will fall off because it only affects males.  Option 6 - Do some research and know your cycle, don't have sex while your ovulating or just before you ovulate (sperm can live inside you for 3 - 5 days so if you pop out an egg you'll have an army of sperm in you waiting to fertilise your egg.) But this is still risky, because it's easy to get wrong.    Really if you are sexually active you should be on the pill... Because condoms can break and guys can pre-ejaculate and sperm can still get inside even if your boyfriend blows his load on you....|`|QB0l3FrSaa	if you do not want to hurt his feelings then have sex with him
hoX7hoINaa	It was like this for me too. I'm now 33 weeks. But from week 22-30 time seemed to fly. I kept myself occupied thinking of ways to set up the nursery and starting that, making lists of things for my registry, and all the other preparations (list for the hospital bag, making a birth plan, etc) Just keep thinking of things you'll want to get done before he/she gets here. You may not have time or energy later.|`|10mOwk0Taa	You could always learn to knit or crochet and make a blanket or little socks for bubs.  Or, you could sew some cute stuff.  There's easy to sew kits for making teddy bears and things like that.  Pamper yourself too, get a massage (book it two weeks from now and you'll have something to look forward to sooner than the birth).  Or get a mani/pedi, if your concerned about sitting in a salon, give yourself one.  Go window shopping for baby stuff.|`|07d2086aa27d1ba3ef711ade9372b259aa	lol I don't know what to tell you here. My first 7 months flew by and now that I'm a few weeks away from my baby being here I feel like time is crawling. It's torture. lol Just keep yourself busy! Go shopping. Find a few hobby! I don't know what you do for fun, but do more of it!|`|1o820L3Daa	Im 20 weeks now and just found out Im having a boy! I know what you mean, but I don't think of it as 20 weeks, I take it week by week, I turn another week on saturdays, so if I think of it like that it doesn't go so slow. Im now going to buy some boy things with my daughter. Go out will my boyfriend, taking my daughter to school. It all adds up, it might seem like its going slow, but when you look back it will seem like it went fast. try getting the babies room ready. That will make the time go faster.|`|XmEqZfjaaa	The waiting is TERRIBLE, isn't it?  My entire pregnancy has seemed to drag on endlessly, but in a good way. But here I am at 30 weeks, and now its hard to believe that its that far along.  All I can say is, please enjoy this now!  I really think that I will miss feeling his kicks and knowing that he is inside me and safe.     I don't know that there is anything that you can do to make time go faster, but I try to do lots of things - go to the gym, shopping, cooking...but nothing seems to make it go faster.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Oh it really does seem like it goes by so slow, because you are so anxious to meet your little one! I have just been trying to keep myself busy as much as possible working, getting things ready, cleaning, shopping for the baby, etc. I figure if I keep myself entertained it will go by much faster! I'm 31 weeks now though and time is starting to crawl. Good luck to you. Have fun on Monday, that's really exciting!
7rIAd6gGaa	My daughter was exclusively breastfed, and she got her first cold at 4 months. She was laying next to a baby whose mom failed to tell me he was just getting over a cold. I realized when he started coughing on her! Anyway, she didn't get another one after that until she was over a year. Now that she's playing with other kids (almost 18 months), she gets them more often than I'd like! That's great that he hasn't gotten one yet. I hope it stays that way!|`|dLLDwZaraa	My 17 month old hasnt had the slightest bit of sickness whatsoever.  No runny noses, sneezing, coughing, ear infections, NOTHING.    And she's never tasted breastmilk.  Go figure.|`|ftbrRTYUaa	My eldest daughter was 11 mo. old when she got her first cold. My son was always fighting a ear infection from about 2 months on. And my youngest daughter got her first cold at a 1 month. She was fine in about a week.|`|FiszETBoaa	My son will be 4 months on Friday. He has his first cold now. Strictly breastfed, but my Mom, who is my babysitter, was sick, so he got it too...and now I have it...lol. Inevitable cycle I guess.    Your lucky!! That booger sucker is the worst thing ever..I feel so bad everytime I have to do it!!|`|udPplJTaaa	My son was 3 months old and I swear he hasn't been 100% since. He's had colds and coughs on and off and right now he has Rotavirus. It is absolutely terrible. The glories of daycare. You are so fortunate!|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My daughter is just about 7 months and got her first cold at 5 months. She also got brochilolitis 2 weeks ago (caused by the RSV virus). She is breastfed, but I guess the cold was inevitable with the weather being so weird around here.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	She was 8 months old, and came down with her first cold on Halloween. :(|`|XSol0H6Uaa	2 weeks old.
mBzQSz4daa	They are great! Elaina does your daughter go to Twin Creeks? I mean Sophia.|`|2xuBWrz0aa	Oh I love them all!!! You could even switch the Payton to go with Ryan and the Lee to go with Violet.  Like  Violet Lee  and  Ryan Payton  But they are all really good the way they are. I think it's cool to name the girl Payton and Sophie is pretty too.|`|3YNzwxncaa	A mother's choice for her baby's names are truly her and their father's  choice, however, since you asked.  The boys name's are good.  I don't   care for Sophie Grace, but Payton, without the Violet is nice.  Why not  try Devyn or Chevaun, pronounced--Dev in and she vaughn.  Good Luck  to the mother and father.|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	Girl:Sophie Grace  Boy:Ryan Lee|`|9tMT4SQUaa	Oh, my!  Four babies!!    Ryan is SO last year.  Pick a newer, funkier name to match the other three!  Liam is okay.    Aaaand the girls names are okay I guess.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	They're okay but the middle name Violet.......ugh.  Also,  I would name the baby Sophia - everyone could call her Sophie.         Sophia sounds more sophisticated and classy...|`|iMULlxdgaa	I like Ryan.  I like Violet...the opther names I just don't know.  Liam is cool...but its like everyone is naming their kid Liam these days..whats up with that?|`|uuceuyRyaa	There perfect names. :)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Nice names - all 4.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	great names although i prefer payton spelled peyton. otherwise i love them.|`|F2i2Ll7saa	I think they are cute funky and delicite names|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I like them, they all sound good together.|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	Love them all but Sophie....    its ok tho i guess|`|85JjEHU1aa	they are all really cute names|`|wIGuhAZXaa	i only like sophie and violet|`|r6TijtS8aa	Congrats to your friend on the quadruplets!! i really like the names, they are very simple. I like Ryan Lee and Liam Shaun, but I think that shaun is spelled a little funny that way. I love the girls names but she might want to consider Sophie Violet and Payton Grace too.|`|ej51eWO7aa	they r alright

The recycled fabrics y'know?  You could search around for one of those, and maybe stuff the inside with diapers and eco-friendly biodegradable baby wipes and organic baby food.|`|gZoljE7Saa	if she is going to nurse get her a hooter hider they are great!|`|fC1HUgAAaa	All the suggestions above area great. They also sell natural organic cotton baby clothes at some stores. My daughter has a couple of 100% organic cotton tee shirts with pictures of trees and birds and rainbows etc. We got them at target.

Organic cotton teething rings (http://www.ringley.ca/) - my children love these.  A baby sling.  I love LittleTwig products!!!! Or California Baby, I hear is good.  Get her a book...Raising Baby Green by Dr Alan Greene - I found this book very informative, and I wouldn't consider myself a beginner, either.  Cloth diapers...whether they are organic or not, cloth diapers are great.
O1Sqcc5yaa	I would do the same (if I was a girl) although it is premeditated assault, which is a felony, so be careful.|`|5tqh0akYaa	i would punch him and tell him to f**k off . but thats just me haha|`|sf5iRPXCaa	Haha well I'm in a long distance relationship, we live in seperate countries, but I think I would break up with him. And if that's out of the question, then I guess you could slap him if you felt the need. But he really shouldn't be cheating on you, no matter what the circumstances.|`|ozATw7s0aa	I would slap him and tell him that I wouldn't do it to him. Then I would be all sad and break up with him. And hopefully he would learn his lesson and not cheat again. I'd rather him just talk to me and be trusting about it.|`|Rqh8VILgaa	i'd probably punch  him in the face:D  don't worry he deserves it!|`|XJEGTZJqaa	ASSAULT cant do that|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Unfortunately - two wrongs don't make a right. Don't retaliate and just be the better person. I agree with Allie and pretend it was the best thing that you are through with him. I know it hurts but if you show him that you are upset, isn't that what he wants? Also when you slap someone they can easily slap back so I would watch out.|`|drI1vsJdaa	That's assault, don't do that. I wouldn't. I'd tell him it's over and not let him know he got to me. Act like it's the BEST thing you ever did breaking up with him! That's WAY better revenge.    EDIT:Do the other thing I said! Then you look more mature|`|89b7405201feaf6d3fdb7bfe0c1d09a9aa	haha I laughed at your additional details of saying he would be a pansy if he called the cops. :)|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	He cheated four times? I'm so sorry!  Dude, I would totally slap him. Cheating on someone is wrong and really stupid.   It's sure a good thing you broke up with him. And if it was assault, many girls would be arrested right now. Haha.
Kz2n6P1Vaa	NO WAY  I ONLY WANT DAUGHTERS  sons are way too hard to get along with and they don't seem to love you as much as daughters    and sons are only a son UNTIL they get married, a daughter is for life.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Well, it's not wrong, but there are more reasons to have kids than dressing them up like dolls and taking them shopping.  You can do that with a poodle.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	its not wrong, but honestly, boys are sooo much more fun as children, and you could always try for a girl, I have a little boy but i still want my little girl and i hoped my first pregnancy was a girl and i dont feel guilty for that, still i wouldnt trade my son for anything in the world, he is tons of fun|`|rDsKB0uXaa	No thats not wrong|`|IUlIixJLaa	I have 4 daughters and wouldn't change it for the world, but life is not all peaches and cream as when they get into their teens it is definitely 'trying' times. I hear that boys are easier? Anyhow, no it is not wrong to want only daughters, I think that everyone has a preference but they don't always voice it|`|twVyisGnaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting only daughters!  We're all human beings with minds of our own.  If you want only daughters, then go ahead.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|XuGFt3boaa	No.  Nothing's wrong with having daughters.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	No. I think everyone has an ideal. I want a boy, then a girl, then another boy, for example. I know I probably won't get that, though.|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Nah, I get along great with my mom, we have a "best friends" relationship.. it is easier to relate to your own sex.    Good luck with your daughter (s)    Cheers =)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I was the same way.  I wanted to have 1 girl and that's it.  When I was pregnant with my first deep down I knew it was a boy.  I chose not to find out the sex at the ultrasound because I did not want to be one of those women who cries when they find out it is not the sex they wanted.  So I waited and when he was born and the doctor screamed "its a boy!" I have never been so happy in my life.  I know it sounds weird but when they hand you your child your gender preference flys out the window.  When pregnant with my second I had a feeling it was a girl and found out during her ultrasound she was in fact a girl.  They are now 7 and 9 and I wouldn't give them up for the world.  The funny thing is that if I am ever blessed with another one I am hoping for a boy.  Good luck hun|`|qvycijbOaa	People who say that don't usually have a sibling of that gender. I would love to have a son but don't have a brother. But remember you will be having a child not for yourself, but for their life. So dressing them up if they don't wanna be dressed up will just p!ss everybody off, she could end up in the army or something lol.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Nothing wrong...I always said I wanted a boy first since I never knew what it was like to have an older brother...then when I got pregnant I thought it would be easier to have a girl...    We want what we want for whatever reason but in the end we are happy to get whatever we get.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Even people who say they don't care what they have do care. It isn't wrong necessarily to prefer one gender over the other; what is wrong though is treating them differently if you wind up with one of each, or resenting your sons if you wind up with 2-3 sons instead of daughters. This is also why it's important for teenagers to practice safe sex and/or abstinence so they can grow up and realize that material things aren't what makes a parent.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Nope, I'd prefer all boys as girls in my family are such little monsters (I'm thinking a much less polite term) when we go through puberty! And the nastiness seems to be a donimant trait as all the girls are like that. Boys on the other hand seem to turn into little angels!|`|coZ7Fm79aa	no as long as if u had a son u wouldnt leave him on the street then no problem with WANTING girls but when u do have kids im sure ull love them regardless boy or girl|`|RIRyRNEeaa	I think thats okay. I think its easier for a mum to relate to girls.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I don't know if it's wrong, but I feel the same way.  I already know names I would use, how I would decorate the nursery, etc for a little girl, but draw a complete blank when it comes to having a boy.  I jokingly told a friend the other day that if I had a boy, I wouldn't know what to do with him.  I'm sure I'd love him just as much as a girl, but girls are so much fun to dress up and all that.. SO I think your feelings are completely normal.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	No, not at all. When I was younger I was like that - I only wanted daughters. Anybody's daughters, blonde, brunette and even an occasional redhead when I was feeling adventurous. ;)|`|IpwsYe2kaa	I think it's perfectly natural for a lot of girls to prefer having girls. I mean boys are going to go to their dad or some other father figure male for the personal matters. whereas the girl is most likely going to come to you, and dressing up the girls is of course way more fun, and just more in our area whereas a boy is going to be like mom cut it out gosh.    But I would prefer a girls as well. I don't feel bad about it, because I know id i don't end up with a girl, but with a boy instead, I'll love him as well.|`|PbPKSNlLaa	No not at all everyone has and ideal of what they want  like i want the big brother thing i want a boy than a girl than another girl. but no its perfectly normal|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	i always heard people just wanting sons first. Nothing bad|`|P4u9yOHKaa	well it's cool every girl wants a lil baby girl.so they can dress them up and stuff so it's cool|`|0TCFrA7iaa	no its not wrong|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	no that's you baby girl why do always ask questioms about your life decisions you not living your life for anyone else but yourself if you can handle it then so be it don't matter what everybody else say because its not their decision to make its not a matter of right or wrong
SLnS5DAwaa	Teenagers shouldn't have sex, we aren't emotionally or even physically ready for the demands of having a child. Don't tell me about protection, because both birth control and condoms (with spermicide) total aren't even 100% prevention. Teenagers are still growing, still going through fights with their body and hormones, still going through school of some sort (even 18-19 should be at college, or at least working full time), and all those stressors does not make an ideal situation.  I think having sex should wait until 21+, when you are out of college and have a steady job and (hopefully) a partner you know will stick by you with every little thing, and be faithful to you. Not necessarily married, but at least in a strong relationship.  Sex is meant to be shared among life-long couples, really. If a teenager isn't ready to commit that much time, or can't, then they shouldn't have sex.    Period. Masturbation will ease sexual tension if you really feel you "need" it.|`|H6w3ACkFaa	When ever your emotionally ready but don't rush in to it because every one else is wait in till your truly in love|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? No sooner then the age of 16, and they should be mature and ready. They should also be able to accept the consquences. ??|`|5tqh0akYaa	as a teenager.     wait till your 18 and    A.  your in true love     B Engaged      C Married|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	WHENEVER THEY DECIDE THEY ARE READY FOR IT.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	When they are emotionally ready for the possible consequences. And when they are truly with someone they love.|`|EccBqsntaa	18+|`|ozATw7s0aa	when they aren't teenagers.    or if there is an age between 20-120 called "allgrownupteen"|`|0WstfAmzaa	In my PERSONAL opinion, I don't think teenagers should have intercourse at all.. I think that sex is for two people who are married to each other.. But that's my PERSONAL opinion..|`|d0fc65f726f4bd56a6ce4f789ee11991aa	Whenever their ready for it. There's no SET time for them to. Maybe when they get married, maybe when they get their first bf/gf, maybe when their just sick of being a virgin. who knows it's up to them..|`|bdBYVhzqaa	Whenever they're ready.  Have patience!...if you rush into having sex...you will get emotionally attached especially us, girls. Guys can have sex with no emotion. That's why we need to wait and see their true colors, and just wait . . . take it slow, get to know the person. No need for rushing
b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	It seems this is the place for all silly, immature, uninformed girls who've had unprotected sex to come and ask the same questions repeatedly.  You've got that right.  I think it is normal for girls to have unprotected sex now, because they're all so desperate these days for somebody to love them.  They don't realize that for the most part, these guys are out for what they can get, and they don't love the girl; also, they might think that a baby will automatically love them--they still don't know how much work and commitment a baby is.  It's all so stupid.  I know girls were having sex when I was young...but somehow, we were a little bit smarter about it.  Not so many pregnancies as there is now.  Why the hell can't they just go to the doctor or the clinic or Planned Parenthood and start taking the pill?  Why can't they see what a great time they'd have, if they'd just wait to have children?|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	What I don't get is why these  girls seem to think they can't get AIDS or STDS.      They assume that when they look at someone they can tell. HUGE MISTAKE!    BRING BACK SEX ED!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	More and more people are having sex at a young age, and it is very disturbing, and it is annoying to have to tell them over and over again to take a test when your period is late, any time you have sex you can get pregnant, and to use two or more forms of birth control every time.  They may not even listen to what we say, but hey- we tried.|`|pcJ6EGwkaa	Yeah I've noticed that even on just the main web page. I guess its happening a lot now. And to be honest its pretty uncomfortable to know that kids in middle school are having sex unprotected or not.|`|xOr67VDiaa	its really ridiculous and sick, they put it all over like they have no respect and no damn brains!! sheesh they think having a kid is so easy, it maybe easy to fall pregnant for some, but not all and the looking after the kid after being pregnant is like not important anymore..They had a 15 year old sayin she had twins, OMG like wtf?? thats not even normal to me, its sick. not 1 but 2 babies!!! god. we just have to believe they are just doing it for attention and not serious about it, because if its happening now at 12,13,14 then god knows what the age will be in the next generation. I really like coming to this place, but i cant stand seeing young girls (children) typing things like are they pregnant from having unprotected sex..ffs..its really sick!|`|G65M35Viaa	Because many teenagers are ignorant, selfish and irresponsible. They think having a baby at 15 is cool. They want to have sex but do not want to face the consequences of it. Then dropping out of school, going on welfare and moving to a trailer park while they look for their next baby daddy. This is where our tax dollars go.
FwgCXDbSaa	if your friend told you who told her... by what your saying could get her in to trouble if its not true.. if she was and you was a true friend i think she would tell you i no i only talk to true friends and by the way you have put this it sounds if its malicious rumors... and if she is she needs to talk to her parents or maybe a school teacher or there is plenty of help lines... is the church a local youth club .were was the staff ....|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? It's her business, and I'd say stay out of it, but since you guys are apparently friends, I'd just say straight out to her in private that I cared about her, and if she needed to talk, you would be there for her. Don't gossip about this with other people. If she is truly your friend, don't talk about it unless its to her. ??|`|z3Oed98laa	ok well first make sure its not just a rumor...cus ive had rumors like that spread that are totally fake. But if it is....wait for her to tell you on her own time. And if or when she does then you should consider talking to a counselor|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You can't do anything until you find out if it's true or not.  IF she really did this, then she will tell you when she is ready for you to know.  There is nothing you can do right now.|`|r39EDGhPaa	what a disrespectful whore.  13, and in a church with an 18 year old?    haha.. i hope this isn't true.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	but it could be rumors.  When the time is right she will tell you dont rush her.|`|9QC1MD4Naa	Your friend will tell you when she's ready.    It could be all rumors, too.|`|3MmVWDT3aa	What do you need help with?? It's her life, you can't live it for her. That guy-if he is 18 he could possibly go to jail for raping a young girl.|`|5D0KuT74aa	if its true, then your friend is a whore  who has sex at 13  she doesn't need any help  she had sex, she has the baby  but its probably a rumor  hopefully  i really reallly hope it is|`|8V39PymEaa	that's rape what is wrong with boys who are at least 16 or older getting 13 yearolds pregnant have her take a test or try to have her confess it   when you two are alone|`|8PWsiyv9aa	I'm the same age as you and you're friend. MY GOD! What is this world coming too. If it's true, (which i doubt it is, but still) don't abort, adopt. Still, it's probably some rumor **** that goes around all the time in every middle school. I'd give her smack too if it really is true (again, which I definitely doubt)|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	tell her she has to take a preggo test its to risky to know and deny it and have nobody else know and then you do bad things during ur pregnancy and stuff and then the baby is bor.     ~happygurl |`|ozATw7s0aa	You need to find that 17 or 18 year old and have him like, exploded lol. What the h3ll would he want to do with a 13 year old! I'm sorry for critiquing your friend, but she's pretty stupid!!    She will tell you when she is ready. Don't bother her about it, but just be there.    Good luck, hopefully it's not true.|`|0K86VI8maa	1.he could be arrested  2.at the church bathroom?  3.99% PROBALLY A  RUMMOR|`|6pEDLnrzaa	It's probably a rumor so many things that age get started like that one of my friends had a rumor about her being pregnant last month|`|PbPKSNlLaa	i can tell your 13 or 14 your in that gossip middle school ****.      groww up if shes pregnet than she obiously dosent want a loud mouth like you knowin|`|v6Vmq4Bpaa	Tell an adult you can trust, maybe a church leader or your mom. Leave out the names though. Reach out to your friend, hailey, but don't come off as judging her, she might pull away from you. Tell her she can trust you and you're their for her if she needs you. Then back off and leave it like that. Don't push her anout it.|`|jQ7Z80fdaa	well if i were you, i would call her to come to your house, or somewhere where you are alone with her, and sit her down and ask her there. . . .she might feel a littl more relaxed wit tellin you. . . but if it is true, you would have to swear that you wouldn't tell anyone!!! lol but then again, i am a boy so what do i know?|`|PS83gPGoaa	in a church lol. sounds like rumours but if it isnt, jus let ur friend no ur there for her
46uiaxPUaa	Not at all, but it is uncomfortable!|`|ZpmZy03maa	You asked a question a while back about your best guy friend. What was his name..? Hunter? Have you had sex yet? You don't have a daughter, liar.|`|GCOv4cVraa	no, not at all.. and tell her how lucky she is to be wearing a retainer instead of having braces|`|JERUmEFzaa	Nope it doesn`t hurt at all. It may feel weird at first but than it gets better.|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	I have one but I only have to wear it at night.    It might hurt the 1st time you use it but not very much.  I don't wear mine as much as I'm ment to. I'm 13 and it hurts a little but no where near as much as something could hurt.  It is funny the first couple of days while you get used to it caus you have a lisp.
BILIAKSOaa	I love that show and can't wait until tonight. I don't get it either because if that were to happen then the final show would have been last week. I think they pick one person and then that person has to choose between them or they both end up dating the person. It's really confusing, but you will just have to wait until tongiht. (: I really like them both and have no idea who they will choose.    The last couple years Tila should have picked Danny and then in the next show Bo, but Christy was good too. (:  I'm just glad they added something new to the show instead of just Tila. Now they have twins ! (:    Hope I helped lol (:|`|1s3nddaYaa	no they are picking one 4 Vikki n one 4 Rikki, not one 4 both to share|`|FklngtvCaa	That's what I thought, too.  The whole show is stupid... so was Tila Tequila's Shot  At Love. And That's Amore.|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	YEA I DONT GET IT EITHER. IM GUESSING ONE FOR EACH. BUT WHAT IF WHO THEY CHOSE WANTS THE OTHER TWIN MORE THAN THE ONE THAT PICKED THEM HAHA. RIDICULOUS HUH !|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Yea I don't get it either. I've only watched it a couple times. Tregors a hottie!|`|i171LlfTaa	I thought it was like Rikki and Vikki each chose one person. Yeah, but I'm not to sure now. That would be like retarded. Anyways, I hope Rebekka wins ;)|`|AA10503158	its a stupid show.|`|zGtELDrnaa	that show is REALLY strange|`|GZqmZ8Ahaa	ikki twins are picking one person for themself ... it is on tonight the final|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I think they are choosing two ppl. I hate that show though, they just want to seem bi even though they are probably not. They do it for the publicity. Grr! I hate that show!!!!    ~happygurl|`|D8gFfDwuaa	when did they say that? I'm confused... wow i have no clue just like u.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	That show is so stupid. Two **** twin sisters picking someone to date then break up with in two weeks! I can't wait to see the finale! Not.
ftSsVFQNaa	Well you can't know for sure with out having a DNA test done. I put your due date into a date of conception calculator. It said to be due then you would have conceived one of these days August 28, through   September 5, 2008. Is that when you were with the guy you like? Well you more then likely got pregnant by guy number 2.    Michelle|`|5tqh0akYaa	wow your a slu*! go figure it out .. how am i suppose to know? its not my problem you decided to sleep around.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	I am going with guy number 2|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	if you cant tell us when your last period is we can't help. you have to wait until the baby is born for a paternity test or do a risky amio now while you're pregnant to find out. way to go.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Wow. That sucks. Hmmm. I'm not a paternity test but it might be guy number 2.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Probably guy 1.Quit sleeping around and you wouldnt be in this position.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Whoa Honey!  You need to have a paternity test done after you have the baby.  It costs about $300.00 but it will let you know who the father is. That's a bad thing about having unprotected sex with more than one dude.  You can never be sure who's little wiggly got your egg.|`|3MmVWDT3aa	I would say guy  1, but go on like Jerry Springer so that you can find out for sure! :)|`|drI1vsJdaa	Girl, you shouldn't sleep around like that. I don't really know. Order one of those kits where you can get your DNA, ONE of the potential dads DNA, and the baby's, and send it back for test results.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I think it was the second guy cause it is 11 months from july to may but from september to may it is only 9 months. You can always get the baby a blood test when it is born.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	we cant give you the correct answer you will need a paternity test|`|5D0KuT74aa	i dont know your babys DNA  take a ******* test|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	I will ask when your last period was, as you can find out when you were ovulating and it will give you a range of 5 days when you possibly got pregnant. or wait for the first ultrasound. when they measure the fetus you can get a better idea of when you got pregnant.|`|L2ldkkoKaa	You should be embarrassed for not knowing your child's father.  And asking a bunch of strangers on the internet who the dad is.|`|DSSZZBTXaa	What day in may is your due date? I'll be able to help better if you tell me the exact day you are do...,  **** I'll check back in a little bit to see if you updated your question :)
6Knhikr1aa	Nursing requires a LOT of water consumption. It sounds like you may be getting dehydrated. I've had this happen. Try drinking a ton of water and see if it helps. It doesn't sound like hormones though. You might try doing more actual nursing rather than pumping and see if it makes a difference as well, it may help regulate your system a little. But the water should be a quick fix and solve the problem long term if you make sure to always drink enough. Good luck!|`|TajdONO7aa	no, i think youre sick. sorry, hope you get better soon.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I didn't experience any of that. Hormones definitely don't cause diarrhea. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon!|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Yeah I was gassy but I got backed up if you know what I mean.  It takes some time for your body to get back on track.     Congrats

I'm not to fond of Jensen though. So what about James Jensen instead?
Qz3sii2caa	The second delivery is usually easier. It was for me, I cut my delivery time in half. Boy, if you shot out the first baby in 5 minutes... have a radio playing in the background at your delivery and see if you can get that kid out before the current song is over LOL you could probably do it.    About the tearing, there's a chance you'll probably tear again. I had an epidural so I didn't feel the tearing. It was harder to heal than the first time around, though. All worth it though, I love my babies!|`|Wl2MnHNKaa	the second is usually ALOT easier so i wouldn't worry too much.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	well they say that the first one is the hardest then after that they get easier, i don't think it can get any easier than your first labor but it might be around the same thing. Good Luck!|`|bTFgSh1Haa	In most every situation, delivery  2 is much easier.  This is because your body has already pushed out a child and therefore has stretched to a certain degree.  It should be much easier, but it sounds like the actual labor for you wasn't too long.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	My 2nd labor was aloot easier than the first.|`|QB0l3FrSaa	actually if you went through labor once you will be ussed to it the second time|`|KEUuLH3zaa	lol i thought this posed a different question...and i think that needs answering as well...    pregnancy,number 2, and labor?
RmQ2czo8aa	i love you.  too much for words to express.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	yeah, it annoys me too, but there is a lot of times where the writer is pushed for time and has to rush.

I have an OCD so I usually never spell things wrong and leave them wrong, but that's just me.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Thank you.     People need to learn they're grammar and word usages!           and yes I used they're instead of their on purpose :]|`|drI1vsJdaa	*claps!* I TOTALLY agree. It makes me SO angry when people can't use proper grammar    LOL! "Your face is ugly, I'm sorry about that."|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Thank god someone pointed it out. I hate bad grammar. It's so annoying. I never type "You" as "U" and I never type "Are" as "R" and "School" as "Skool". I'm sure not a parent but bad grammar is a pet peeve of mine. It's good to see someone else hates it, too.|`|IDjP94NHaa	there is also...  Buy-"are you gonna buy that shirt?"
yH39NEXSaa	I like Aiden Joseph Green better. Don't name him Hunter Green. That's the name of a color. :)|`|uuceuyRyaa	Aiden Joseph Green    Who cares if it's commen?    It's a good name, im sure he'd love to have it :)|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Out of the two, I like Aiden better, but I like these too:    Kyle Joseph Green  Michael Joseph Green  Aaron Joseph Green  Paul Joseph Green  Christopher Joseph Green  Zane Joseph Green  Eric Joseph Green    Hope he arrives healthy, and congrats to you and your family :)|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I like Hunter Joseph Green    Zayden Joseph Green  Shane Joseph Green  Cooper Joseph Green  Jasper Joseph Green    I like Hunter 100 times better than Aiden  Hunter Green, I would not do that to my son|`|y4Uliyq3aa	I Love Hunter Jospeh Green! I like that Hunter Green Is the color of a crayon.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I love the name Hunter Joseph! It's one of my faves! I also like Dominic Joseph Green, Ethan Joseph Green, Ryan Joseph Green, and Nolan Joseph Green.    Hunter Green is kind of funny. But Hunter is awesome! Hmmm... good luck!|`|l83UPxggaa	I like Aiden too, but it definately has become too popular. I really like Trevor, Dalton, Jesse, Asher, Declan, and Chace (which happens to have the same meaning as Hunter).|`|TYl7kmPeaa	dont do hunter green  then he would be a crayon color  he will get made fun of  plus aiden green sounds soooo much better|`|b4J5jE7naa	love Aaden Joseph i was planning on that too until it got too popular and now i like Brody and Connor|`|85JjEHU1aa	I like Hunter|`|h90ABQYaaa	i like aiden alot
7rIAd6gGaa	What you're feeling is completely normal. I think many new moms go through the same thing. Dads sometimes take longer to bond, and aren't as comfortable with a new baby. They're so tiny and men are often "scared" of them. That being said, at least he's doing one night feeding. Just ignore his complaining and sleep! :) Your baby is used to being with you more, so he's more comfortable with you and will cry less. That's ok. I promise it will get easier for all of you soon. The first few months are the hardest. Good luck!|`|TajdONO7aa	ok, men aren't typically real "into" newborns. thats your area. its ok, just give it some time. usually when they start interacting a little more.|`|2jypjeQJaa	My daughter is 9 weeks old and I had and still sometimes have the same exact problem!Just lately(the past week) is my husband becoming more comfortable. I am sure that you have been having some frustration issues yourself with having a new baby and always knowing the right thing to do. You have to just try everything and figure it out. I think it takes the husbands a little bit longer to get used to this and knowing that they have to do the same thing, just figure it out. My husband also acts like it's a chore to take care of the baby, especially since I have been on maternity leave and he has been working. Like I am supposed to do everything, I mean Everything! Get up for night feedings, take care of the baby during the day, wash clothes do dishes, etc. I keep having calm talks with him about how I need his help and how I shouldn't have to force him to want to spend time with his daughter, even if he has just come home from work. I just went back to work this week so we will see. Just know that others are going through very similar issues and you are not alone. It is hard to have patience with them (husbands) but know that in time they will form a bond with the baby and it will eventually get better. I think something that has helped my husband is that the baby is changing and not just laying there, she is more interactive now with smiling and kicking and punching. My husband just changed his second poop diaper this weekend when I wasn't home. I have to go to Wal-Mart to get alone time, sad huh! Moms are awesome!!!!|`|ioZeveazaa	Your baby is still very very young and you are your baby's favorite right now. The baby recognizes when you aren't around anymore by your scent and voice. Your husband can bond by doing feedings, changing diapers, singing to him, etc. However don't expect your baby to like it so much when you leave. It will get better as the baby gets older. Right now though he is so very young and just wants and needs you. Good luck!|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	In my opinion, I think men do better with older children. As my daughter got older the more my husband interacted with her, and it's the same thing with my son. He is two months as well, and when he was first born my husband was a little cool with him. But now that he smiles, and can hold his head up and stuff I find my husband plays with him more. It just takes men longer to bond with babies. If you research the subject you will find that babies have "built in" things to help dad bond (babies usually look like dad when first born, that new baby smell is for dad).     Don't worry, he'll come around. My husband still makes it a chore. But it is what it is, I choose my battles and this one I don't fuss over really. I know he loves his kids...I'm just Mom, and Mom does more no matter what!|`|oUtEVKDHaa	My bf is the same way. He cant have our daughter for more than five minutes if Im home. I have a hard time going to the bathroom and eating because Im the only one who takes care of her. If she is playing on her swing or something and Im about to eat or something he say hurry up before the baby cries. I tell him well if she does youre there too you know. He would always rush me and act as if taking care of the baby is easy. Now he lost his job and he watches her while I work. Now he changes diapers and what not. When I come home all he does is complain about how tired he is and how he couldnt get things done. I always tell him its not that hard I would it all by myself. Now the tables are turned. But the minute I get home he just hands me the baby and he goes and lays down. I dont even have time to get settled in. Im at work all day and have to come home and work too. Men are really inconsiderate let me tell you. theres some good men out there that help out but you and I must of gotten the bad ones. At night the baby wakes up at least 4 times to eat. What is my bf doing?? SLEEPING! He doesnt care if I sleep or not while I have to wake up at 6 in the morning!! I dont know what to do with that either but now he know that its not easy since hes watching her during the day! As for yours well he should be involved as well I mean you didnt make the baby by yourself he should help out! I dont know how to make them see that!! good luck!|`|EFYkci30aa	Oh, I almost started crying reading this because it's exactly what I went through with my first who is now 2, and am going through it a little bit again with our second, who just turned a month old.  YOU ARE NOT BEING SELFISH AT ALL!!!!  I went through some bad post partum depression with our first and all the ill feelings were resentment for my husband, I had such horrible feelings of hate for him. . .it was ugly.  Anyway. . .the more time that went by, my husband got better, and now that our first (son) is 2, my husband is awesome with him.  My husband admitted that "newborns weren't his thing and I did better with them" (which is a bunch of bull**** excuses), but at least he admitted he wasn't pulling his weight.  There were a couple occasions that I literally just had to set our baby in front of my husband and run out the door to get some time to myself - it ticked my husband off, but I felt so much better just getting a little time to myself.  We are only human, ya know?  The best I can tell you is just keep explaining how you feel to your husband and if he's anything like mine, he will eventually start helping more.  Please know that a lot of women go through this and you are not alone and are not being selfish.  Hang in there, it will pass eventually, I promise!!|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	Welcome to the reality of men lol  It is so annoying that they make it seem like they are doing a favor "babysitting" for you even though it is just as much their child as yours.  I think the toddler years do get better, but they will still make a big deal of having to do any "babysitting" and they also seem not to have as much patience as we do in the toddler years.      I know all men aren't like this, but all the ones that i know are lol  I have just come to accept it.|`|qkpFuIfeaa	I guess I don't really have an answer since I'm in the same boat, but wanted to just let you know I understand.  Our son is 7 weeks old, and he's our 2nd child, but yeah, same deal in our house girl.....I understand my bf goes to work, but does he think I'm twiddling my thumbs all day....Our jobs as moms are 24/7, we don't get to show up at a certain time and clock out at the end of our shift.....there is no end.  And besides, it's not like I've never worked before, and when I did I had to come home and do all the same stuff I'm doing now....He gets to come home and say, "what's for dinner?"    But yeah, everyone says that's how men are....so i guess we all jus need to hang in there......
Vm7vpqsmaa	i once had a survivor birthday sleepover. we all had a lot of fun.  we made 3 different kinds of jello...one with salt, one with hot sauce, and one with syrup in it for the eating challnege.    we had another challenge were we had to go on a scavengers hunt and ask neighbors for everything. we then had to use everything we got to wrap around an egg so you could drop it ten feet and not have it crack.  then we did an obstacle course.    later that night we had pizza, and smores around a bon fire.we watched a movie and ate tons of junk food. we had so much fun!!!!!|`|V31Vs0nJaa	you can go to friendlys for dinner, then invite ur friends over for a sleepover and play titanic, and when u get hungry eat bagel bites XD|`|3YNzwxncaa	I like the idea of a bagel theme.

MW18liqTaa	Indeed, weaning before two years increases the risk of illness for a child, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I think you can BF as long as you want. Your baby, your choice|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	What has it got to do with her? Your baby your booby your choice. MILS are always full of it...she's done her time as a Mother...now it is your time....|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	UNICEF and the WHO recommend at least 2 years with no upper age limit. Of course it has nutritional value past the age of 1. On those days that your son doesn't feel like eating solids, well at least he's getting his nutrition from you. I never heard of any mother's milk turning sour or rotten magically on their child's first birthday. You MIL is wrong, just hope she doesn't convince her son that she's right.    *Edit* Sure UNICEF and the WHO recommend at least 2 years for 3rd world countries, but that doesn't mean developed countries eat the greatest. Look at the obesity rates for North America because of all the processed, fast food crap we eat. Breastfeeding is way healthier than french fries (not that I'm implying that's what you feed your child), breast milk packs way more nutritional punch and it designed for our babies.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If we all did what our mother in laws suggested we'd be feeding them solids at 2 months, letting them cry for hours in their crib at 6 weeks and putting whiskey on their gums when they were teething.  It would not be my personal choice to do it, but it's not my baby.  And it's not your MIL's baby either.  You should go for it, lots of women do.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	MIL is silly and wrong.     Harriet|`|68c6B8dRaa	You know -- even if it were true, so what; your MIL would still be a fool. Toddlers enjoy nursing. It makes them happy. I know my daughter feels more love from nursing than from any of the kisses I'm always trying to give her while she's running away from them. And the milk is like some sort of magical toddler de-fussing fluid; it just makes everything right with the world again for her.    But. Print this out for the MIL: http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/eb...    Not that this is her business at all anyway...|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Breast-milk is always nutritional and you should do it for as long as you feel comfortable.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Oh my god, any woman who is still breastfeeding at 2 needs some help. You gotta ween the kid sometime, can't have a toddler stuck to your boob!    EDIT: Mia, I am a mother of 5 who chose to NEVER breastfeed her perfectly healthy children, they were off botles at 6 months. And my sister weened her children at 7 months and all of them took it very well. Like said before, If they can ask for it - they are too old to have it.    EDIT: If you feel it is still healthy, pump and give it to him in a bottle. The kid's gotta grow up sometime.|`|TU7vDI95aa	Whoa... okay... if your kid can walk up to you whenever he feels like taking a swig, I say he's too old.  Gross.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Your MIL seems like she is full of S H I T.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Your mother in law is wrong. The benefits of breast milk do not stop after 1 year of age. The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for 2 years, but it is always up to the mother and baby to decide when to stop breastfeeding.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Is this your child's only source of food? If so, maybe that's not nutritionally enough. I truly don't know, but offer that as a suggestion. You can of course continue to BF as long as you want, but is that all your child is getting?  Maybe you are feeding solids as well and I sound dumb for even asking? Again, I don't know.|`|AA11993638	In third world countries it is typical to breast feed a child longer but in civilized nations most people stop between 6 months and a year. It is okay to do so longer but remember they might need solid foods as well. Once you are feeding the child solid foods, they tend to require less breast milk. The benefit is usually done within the first month or so toward their immune system. So in reality the major benefit has already been reached, and maybe this is what your MIL is talking about, after all the child will need to be weened and the longer you take in doing so, the more difficulty you may have.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Mother's milk is the perfect nourishment for the baby, helps the womb retract to normal size after birth, and discourages breast cancer.      My wife got a lot of information and encouragement from the La Leche League.  You might want to check with them, too.    Best regards,  Michael|`|k9bSqig6aa	Noooooo you can breastfeed for as long as you want!  It's extremely healthy and has so many vitamins.  Don't listen to her, she for some reason wants to find something to tell you you're doing wrong so she has input.  Do it for as long as you comfortably can...and you might want to stop before preschool to ween your baby off.|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	The average age for babies to wean from Breast Feeding, is between the ages of 2 and a half and 3 (one if weaning off the bottle). Age 4 the latest. Anything past 4 is creepy (I don't care what hippy mothers say, if they can ask for it they're too old to have it!)|`|JnFgPnMvaa	idk about the "1 year was recommended and 2 was better" but recently i watched a thing on a woman who still breastfed her 8 year old... so im GUESSING that you can't be too old but i dont know for sure.|`|fElrYibYaa	it is actually normal for a kid to breastfeed until theyre four but you do need to start giving him solids ween him when it feels right|`|YwqfYVPbaa	Breasfeeding your child past the one year mark is a personal choice and it's honestly not your mother in law's place to make that decicion for you. However, it is true that breast milk alone no longer provides adequate nutrients for your child after 12 months. You should be offering him nutritional meal and snack choices and water each day as well. As long as you're doing that, I really don't see the problem.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	The AAP recommends 2 years!  Longer if you are comfortable.  While the nutrition is important no matter how old your nursing child is, it is very much about the connection between mother and child.      One year minimum, though.  At one year a child can become completely independent nutritionally...however, this doesn't mean he or she should.    WE SUPPORT YOU!  Good luck as you continue nursing!|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Please - nurse as long as you are comfortable and your little one is good with it. Weaning is easier, less stressful and much more successful when it happens naturally - when mom and baby are ready.    Sadly, this is none of your mother-in-laws business; she needs to be respectful of how you feed your child, and keep her sniggers to herself. If not, perhaps she can visit again after your baby is weaned.    I nursed my daughter regularly until 2, and then for about 8 months after just before bed. The transition was easy, no guilt for me and no sense of loss for her. I'm very glad that I didn't force weaning, and ignored the negative comments from others. I'm nursing my son now, who is 9 months, and I plan to do the exact same thing!    BTW Kristin L and Ramena, no good mother would ever begrudge another for feeding their baby in the most natural, healthy way - regardless of the child's age. They should reserve their comments until they have some experience in this regard.    *Edit    dmg - that MIL observation is hilarious and so true!!!! LMAO!    *Edit  Kristin L - your edit supports my point, you don't have any experience with this aspect of parenting  regardless of how many children you have. Unfortunately, your lack of experience and/or knowledge in the area of nursing renders you response fairly dismissible to committed, nursing mothers (and people who haven't nursed but have a firm understanding of how beneficial nursing is).    On an aside, weaning an infant at 6 months as you boast should not be a point of pride for anyone, and given the dangerous impact this type of parenting can have, you might consider keeping that decision quiet. In other words, I wouldn't brag too loudly about it, as I suspect many might interpret failing to provide a bottle to a 6-month old baby as being neglectful. In fact, I'm quite surprised that you haven't been reported to the authorities  especially given how vocal you are about it and the number of children you've had. By the way, many people neglect their children and those children still have periods of healthiness, so your children being healthy shouldn't really a point of pride either.    Mind you, this sort of admitted and perhaps questionable parenting underscores the illegitimacy of the other advice you've given here.  So, my thanks to you for supporting my point, and my best wishes to you and yours.    (Kristin L - also - just so you know for the future, the word is spelled "wean" not "ween". And since you've never nursed, you may not know your pumping advice is as invalid as your other comments; regular, frequent pumping for years and years is really not a terribly viable option for many mothers.)|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	MIL is full of herself! I nursed my last one for three years, and she is heathy and extremely intelligent, loving, and well balanced emotionally. My husband nursed to age six, and there is nothing wrong with it. It is entirely normal to nurse a toddler outside of the US. Your instincts as a mother will tell you wen it is time to wean. MIL should practice MYOB. God bless.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	You haven't learned to "not hear" your MIL yet?    Do what you want.    You to MIL:  "What? Did I think about what you said about breastfeeding after 12 months?  Geez I am SOOO SPACEY I guess I didn't even hear you say that (or "oops I completely forgot with so many things on my mind")..so anyway..."  (move on to different subject)|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Your MIL is full of ..it. LMAO. She's as ignorant as some of the posters here. Keep on nursing mama.    EDIT:  It's not just recommended to bf for 2 years or beyond in third world countries. Is America a third world country? Canada? No. Ok, case closed. Education, research people... it saves you from looking IGNORANT.  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare...  "The American Academy of Family Physicians Position Paper on Breastfeeding   "Breastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is currently not the cultural norm and requires ongoing support and encouragement. Breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy is not unusual. If the pregnancy is normal and the mother is healthy, breastfeeding during pregnancy is the woman's personal decision. If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned. Breastfeeding the nursing child after delivery of the next child (tandem nursing) may help to provide a smooth transition psychologically for the older child."'  "2004 Health Canada Recommendation on Exclusive Breastfeeding Duration  "Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life for healthy term infants, as breast milk is the best food for optimal growth. Infants should be introduced to nutrient-rich, solid foods with particular attention to iron at six months with continued breastfeeding for up to two years and beyond."     Breastfeeding Committee for Canada: Breastfeeding Position Statement   "Breastfeeding exclusively to the age of about six months then continuing breastfeeding and complementary foods for up to two years of age or beyond is the optimal method for feeding infants and young children."'
J47FzOQmaa	dr. Ramirez, Elizabeth|`|GdSzrtmAaa	No!
PExOJJLgaa	She probably likes to humor others with everyone's problems but her own. She wants to get a laugh, but doesn't want to reveal HER embarrassing moments, or embarrassing things about herself.  Ask her to respect you by finding real jokes.      If she doesn't respect what you tell her, who needs a friend like this?  who would WANT a friend like this?|`|3MmVWDT3aa	Ummm... I'm not sure about your question other than you're title but- she is probably just wanting attention? Maybe she is trying to tear you down so that she can feel more secure about herself?|`|JOR9dSSuaa	she just wants to show off in front of others. confront her and tell her how you feel. if she doesn't change then do the same to her one time and ask her if she liked it. tell her it hurts you, if she still doesn't quit, then move on to different friends.   good luck :]
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	just keep on walking. No need to push the baby if she doesnt want to come. Castor Oil is no good unless you want to puke and poop your way into labor and have the craps during delivery. YUCKY|`|AA10624857	I am mom to 4 who were all born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days, and 7 days. I understand how frustrating it is to watch that due date go right on by with no apparent signs of labor. Especially with my first 2, I was motivated to try lots of things to get on with the show. I walked for miles, had a lot of sex, ate spicy food, did squats, walked up and down stairs, tried nipple stimulation (did bring on some intensed contractions, but nothing came of it), drove down bumpy back roads, and scrubbed floors on my hands and knees. In the end, my first 3 babies came when both they and my body was ready. With my 4th, I was 38 and had Gestational Diabetes so my team of doctors was talking about induction. There was no medical reason for it since I was managing my blood glucose numbers well and my baby was not getting too big. I refused induction mainly because I didn't think it necessary. However, at 41 weeks, I did reluctantly agree to have a prostoglandin gel insertion only because I had no signs of impending labor at all, no dilation, no effacement, few Braxton Hicks contractions. The intent was to see if the gel would soften and thin my cervix enough to get labor going. Instead, I had a bad reaction to it which sent me into 6 minute contractions and my baby into distress with alarmingly low heart rates in the 40's and 50's! Very scary. Red raspberry leaf tea is one of the many Old Wives' Tales that claim to help labor start, but like all the rest, there is no guarantee with anything. I'd ask some questions before agreeing to induction. Is there a medical reason? If not, you can choose to let nature run it's course. Many women do have good experiences with induction, but there are some risks you should be aware of, including the one that inductions done when baby and mom aren't quite ready have a higher rate of ending in a c-section due to non-progressing labors.|`|lU5mdniUaa	i was a month late and my mom tried everything Castor oil and walks jumping off chairs i was a month late and had no hair and a tooth by the time i came into this rotten world do not rush your child he or she knows they do not wish to be here at this time|`|hoX7hoINaa	Baby will come when ready. Some go to 42 weeks. Continue what you're doing and it'll happen.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Relax! You should be giving birth any day now. It's only a matter of time.|`|LiPoEBenaa	The tea you're looking for is either raspberry leaf of manzanilla (chamomile) tea. The Mananilla tea is an old mexican remedy for starting contractions. It worked for both of my sister's pregnancies. She drank a pot and was in labor 24 hours later. I'm 36 weeks and if I go over due I plan on using it!   Good Luck and Congrats!    EDIT: Do not use castor oil... unless you think you would enjoy a very messy labor. It causes contractions in the bowels-not your uterus. It just makes you have the runs!|`|UDteoD8haa	As I found out nothing really works and I have tried everything there is.. im also a week overdue .. so I feel your pain|`|9xviGNWkaa	Sex, walking and castrol oil|`|2RsCIdYcaa	Hi there,  I have been told that eating a hot curry works...although it depends if you like curry.    Good luck and congratulations|`|dxTwHB1yaa	Not sure why the second poster got two thumbs down, but there is an old wives tale that taking a tablespoon of castor oil each day could bring on labor...it helps clear out the bowels by cramping the intestines (which lie around and above the uterus at the end of pregnancy) it might cause a reflexive cramping and spasms of the uterine muscle, which might then turn into labor.
XNHFyP3iaa	Yes. Implantation bleeding is generally brownish and very light. If you had a regular, period-like bleeding, it was probably your period.
nfzQkvqraa	I wish I did it sounds really good.  It sounds like you could make it just the way you described and just cook the meat until it reached the proper temp.  If you want a filler you could add noodles or rice.  I'm curious to see the responses you get as this sounds like a good recipe.
DLDweOcYaa	I guess every time is different.  May I ask why you are already booked in for a c-section?  I was 3 weeks early with my daughter and I plan to have another natural birth and not a c-section.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	It is total random.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	I think it could be totally random. My first cousin had a baby girl three years ago and she was two weeks early, this time she's pregnant with a boy and she's already three days overdue.     They do say however that for the most part that women have a shorter labor with the second pregnancy.     If you go into labor before your c-section date then they will probably go ahead and do it anyway...even if it is earlier than "planned."
7rIAd6gGaa	I let her sleep as long as she would at night, but woke her after 4 hours during the day. That was only because I wanted her to get her day and night figured out though. There are babies (with very, very lucky mommies) who sleep through the night (8 hours) at 5 weeks, so he definitely isn't going to starve! He's a good weight, and sounds healthy, so it's really up to you. If you want him to keep sleeping during the day, let him. But if you want to switch the day and night sleep patterns, I would probably keep waking him up. But definitely once he starts sleeping longer stretches at night, let him go!! Good luck!|`|aPN7NsvXaa	I nursed my son on demand and do so with my daughter, as well.  My daughter was sleeping about 5-6 hours in the beginning.  For several months she slept like this, and would not wake enough for me to feed her if I did try to nurse her.  I had to let her do it herself.      As long as everything is fine, nursing on demand is wonderful.  It lets your child know you are always available and gives them a tangable security!      Good luck!  Breastfeeding mothers everywhere support you!|`|8NJM0NVvaa	My daughter (now 4 yo) I would feed on demand.  She would sleep like you are describing your son does.    My son on the other hand (16 days old) I have to wake to eat because he was 5 weeks early and will not wake to eat on his own.  He really does not even cry when he gets hungry.  He will root a little and then go back to sleep if nothing is offered to him.  I would say that you should just let him sleep and wake when he wants to feed.|`|baI5G8yLaa	Feed on demand if there isnt any weight issues or heatlh problems let sleeping babies lye    As long as he dosent sleep for an extremly long time say 8 hrs then sounds good to me    breast fed babies are suppose to be fed on demand!  doctors all say differnt things your never know who to believe  g-luck|`|dVEXlaWVaa	My children always let me know when they were hungry, I never had to wake them to feed them. It didn't hurt them in any way they all 3 are perfectly healthy. They may be small but they know when they are hungry. And try and I know its hard but try to keep him/her awake as much as you can during the day. Perhaps they will sleep better. I fed my kids breast and bottle. by the way.|`|52bAHCaUaa	My daughter was born 3 months early, so it was important that I still wake her up so often even after she came home at full term.     However, everything else I have read says never wake a sleeping baby! So, I don't see why you should have to wake him up. He also needs his sleep, he'll let you know when he's hungry!|`|BUI9HnH1aa	I wouldnt bother about waking him for a feed , it sounds like he gaining enough weigh with out feeding every 2 hours .. I wouldnt let him go over 6 hours tho during the day.  But if u feed him every 2 hour during the day , he will be more likely to sleep longer during the night .  I was told to feed my son every 2 hours ( at least) because he had jaundice and too much weight while my milk was coming in .  but after 3 weeks i was told not to worry about waking him , i then fed on demand. bub is now 4 months and gets feed every 4 hours ( which is his choice) but if hes really hungry i tend to spend all day on the sofa.
7rIAd6gGaa	Breastfeed her as much as possible, and avoid formula as much as possible. The more she nurses, the greater your supply will become. Pump as often as you can as well. There's also an herb called fenugreek (unsure of the spelling, sorry) that is supposed to increase your milk supply. I had the opposite problem (way too much milk!!), but a friend of mine needed to increase her supply and it worked for her within a matter of days. I would also suggest calling a lactation consultant. Some of them will help you out over the phone, and you don't even have to go in (or pay!). Good luck!|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Allowing the child to nurse after the milk is gone is the best way to increase supply. One beer or glass of wine will also help.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I think you are on the right track. Breast feed any chance you get and pump that will help. Keep it up see a lactation consultant.    Good luck and just keep it up. Try not to use formula only use it if you see she is realy hungery.    Breast feed when you are sick will give your baby the antibodies .|`|aPN7NsvXaa	My lactation consultant recommended Fenugreek, 3 pills, 3 times/day.  Within a day your milk should start going up.  However...you will start to smell like maple syrup...ha...an amusing side effect!    Contact a LLL consultant, though.  There could be other recommendations anyone else on the board might miss.
Tr84hpY2aa	there is nothing wrong with you. those feelings are completely normal. your hormones are going to bring about so many different changes in every way possible. when i was pregnant with my first child, i couldn't stand the smell or thought of my husband being anywhere around me. just give your spouse the heads up on the upcoming hormone changes. so don't worry to much about it.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	HORMONES|`|uuceuyRyaa	completly normal    dont worry :)|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Your hormones. It's gonna be a long ride for many of us - hang in there!!!|`|hoX7hoINaa	The idea of pregnancy is starting to settle in. It takes a few weeks before it starts to get to you that its real. Once you see it on ultrasound in a few weeks, it'll be more real. If you're regretting it, dont, cause every pregnancy ends in a baby and its worth it.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    This is pregnancy darling   wE all feel like this during pregnancy : Hormones changes in the body due to pregnancy. Which make us act and feel this way.    Relax and pamper yourself ;)    god Bless x|`|GdSzrtmAaa	It is normal.

Feeling down could be a mixture of hormones as well as a lack of nutrients. Eat something healthy and make sure to include a whole grain carbohydrate and some protein. (whole wheat bagel w/ eggs, crackers and peanut butter). Also be sure to take a prenatal vitamin regularly and get a lot of fluids.
ihBFGugIaa	Well, I have never had that happen, but I wanted to wish you luck. It would seem to me that you are pregnant.  They say a line is a line.  Good Luck to you|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	it sounds like your pregnant. you should have a blood test done to see if you are pregnant. your hormones may be too low to show pregnancy.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Believe me once your in labor you kind forget about all that. You should be used to doctors and nurses all up in your buisness by now. You can request the amount of people in the room at the time of labor. I was very strict with that, my mom wanted to be there as well as sisters, and a friend I put my foot down and said NO and made sure the nurses kept them out till I was well done. Only my husband, one doc and one nurse was present. I had the epidural and by the time it I wanted it I didnt care about the needle or any discomfort I just wanted it. They keep it out of sight till they are ready and if you request not to see the needle they wont show it to you. Once its time to push you wont care who puts a hand or eye where!!! it will all be fine and the experience of the baby out weights the uncomfortable times.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	Well first off let me start out by saying usually when you get the epidural you are in a lot of pain and well both times i have had the epidural i could not even feel it. Second when your in labor you don't think about who is all in the room all you want is to get that baby OUT.However I understand, when i was pregnant with my second baby i was so freaked out even tho i knew what to expect but in all honesty it only lasted until i  got to the hospital and then i was fine and did not care about anything besides getting the baby out safe. Best Wishes to you and your baby!! You will be fine. :)|`|9hrJfhIIaa	There's going to be people "all up in your business" with or without an epidural. It's birth, your going to be spread eagle  so the baby can pass.     As far as the epidural - you don't see the needle or what they're doing. Out of sight, out of mind.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	LOL It's totally normal to feel this way. Trust me once you are in labor you won't care who is up on your business you are just going to want the baby to come out. Only you would know if you can handle the pain. Good luck!|`|LiPoEBenaa	Just relax! I'm a modest girl too, but it's for a good cause. You can also request that no interns or students be present during your birth. If you have your mom or mother in law in the room, you can request that they stay around your shoulder area so that they aren't "up in your business" lol As far as the epidural, most women I know who have had one said the prick of the needle was nothing in comparison to the contractions they were feeling. I plan on having an epi for pain relief. Good luck and congrats!|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I'm 37 weeks with number 2! So first off congrats because we're almost there!  Do your research on epidurals and read up on the pros/cons and side effects.  I had one with my son and I regret it completely.  I reacted badly to it and so did my son and I almost ended up with an emergency c section.  I've also had nerve problems in my shoulder from it and it was linked back to the epidural.  I would try other relaxation and calming techniques before resorting to it and I've also noticed they like to push it on you right when the contractions get bad.  That's just my opinion though. If you feel you need it then get it!  Also don't worry about people up in your business. As soon as you go into labor you could care less what else is going on. All you want is for that baby to be out of you. I even had a mirror brought in so I could watch and all the interns were in my room and it didn't bother me at all. Labor's unlike anything you've ever experienced before, but once it's over, it's over and you get to finally hold that beautiful baby you've been toting around for 9 months!|`|5f2cf9042681845cc79878f56a8a1d2baa	The epidural is the best thing in the world. I didn't even feel the pinch of the first needle and after I had the epidural I was able to relax. As for everyone up in your business, I was the same way, but when they telll you it's time you get so excited and concentrating on pushing that you don't even realize or care.
YPwGJ6BVaa	Telling your daughter that this behavior, or this part of her body is "nasty", "naughty", disgusting, wrong or whatever else all those other posters said is not the way to handle the situation. As an Early Education Professional for 12 years I can assure you that this type of interest and behavior at this stage is very normal. At around age 3 children are becoming more aware of their genitals usually due to the fact that they are in the beginning stages of potty training. This is an area of their body that has been covered up by a thick plastic covering for years and it is suddenly becoming more exposed, due to potty training pressures.     If you are uncomfortable with the behavior it is never a bad idea to speak with your pediatrician and i am sure that he will confirm that it is normal behavior. I also agree with the poster that suggested finding a new child care facility. Any center with employees that are finding this behavior to be inappropriate is not a reputable center.      My personal "mommy" suggestion is to simply explain to her that these areas are private. They are her private body and no one should ever make her feel uncomfortable about that. Explain to her what is appropriate and inappropriate when it comes to others touching her down there. (She needs to know that it is ok for people to change her diaper or mommy to wash her down there.)     Also explain to her that yes you know that it "tickles" when she touches it but that is something she may only do in private. Or if you are against that policy simply state that that is not something that you do in your family.Each family has different values that are important to them and if touching one's self is something that is not accepted in your value system as an adult then you need to explain that as tactfully as you can to her.    Most importantly remember you are speaking to a 3 year old. You don't need to go into details of masturbation, or sex, this behavior has absolutely nothing to do with sexuality. If she had discovered that tickling her elbow made her feel good you wouldn't be as worried, in her mind the two are the same, but this particular behavior seems to get a rise out of everyone and so it continues.     If you make your child feel shameful about their body you are only going to exacerbate the problem. It may be hard for you or uncomfortable but the best way to deal with it is to tackle the issue head on.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	To protect her and yourself, talk to her doctor about this.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My 5 year old started noticing her body at about that age and even today when I give her a bath she will make some comment about how it tickles her if she touches herself.  I just look at her calmly and tell her that she isn't to be touching herself in that area. If her hands are dirty she could make that area hurt.  She doesn't do it much anymore.  Considering your daughter is 3, trying to sit down and explain things to her is pointless.  Every time she does it, just gently remind her that her body is her own and her friends do not need to be seeing it. The only people that should see her naked is mommy and daddy when they give you a bath or change her, and the doctor when he is doing checkups.  She will grow out of it.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	you should talk to her doctor becuase this could be an emotional effect of having child services called. also tell her that that is nasty and that other kids are making fun of her. punish her whenever she does take her diaper off or make a comment like that. sit her down and have a serious talk.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	You should change day care centers. They obviously don't understand normal childhood behavior there.     3 year olds don't have any shame about being nude in front of others. If they look surprised or she gets a big reaction every time she drops he pants at day care she is going to do it again. Someone who works with children should know this.     Get her out of there before they make your life miserable.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	i think its just curiousity.  however, i would ask her, very nicely and friendly and all smiles 'honey, do you tickle your body?' 'anyone else tickle your body' etc. you see where i'm going with this.    after that's resolved and your mind is at ease, start using (if you aren't already) the word 'privates'.  and give her examples every day.  'oh mommy is going to get dressed, i'm going to shut the door so no one can see my privates', etc.  just keep reinforcing.|`|7vfJimlwaa	What u should maybe do is to tell her gently how naughty and offensive to others that is and if she needs to talk like that only to talk to u.
52bAHCaUaa	Why is adoption not an option? Just curious..    This is a decision only you can make...nothing anyone on here says is going to change your situation you are currently in.|`|zwctZ812aa	There is help out there for those who really need it.  If you are doing the best you can, working full time and not buying unnecessary things and ends just aren't meeting, then there is temporary help until you get on your feet.  You can get on WIC to help with food during your pregnancy and after if you choose to breastfeed.  If you choose to formula feed, WIC will supply formula.  There is also food stamps and some public aid housing.  What I would suggest is finding a family member to move in with.  That way you could save money on rent and bills and have some time to save up.  good luck and I wish your new family the best.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	There are many places to go for help. If adoption isn't an option, I think the best choice is to keep the baby. I don't believe in abortion. I'm not sure why adoption wouldn't be an option though...     You can probably get all the baby gear you need at tag sales or from organizations who donate it. Once the baby is here, if you breastfeed, your only real cost for the first 6 months will be diapers.     Can your partner get a second job? That would probably cover all of the costs.     Good luck!|`|AA11993638	There is help for before the baby is born for food items, doctor appointments and the like. As for keeping the child afterwords, there is some assistance until the child is in school but granted this will not pay all the extra bills. There is always adoption, where the mother who is not ready to care for her child can give him or her to a family that will care for it and love it. The is not justifiable reason adoption is not an option, it should come before an abortion. It is better to give the child to a loving home than to kill it, or not provide for it because of your situation. Remember what ever you decide, it will need to be one you can live with.|`|ocNUYENRaa	There is tons of help out there for those who need it. If you have the support of your family I'm sure they can help out. Breastfeed, that will be free food for your baby for 6 months. Cloth diapering is cheaper than disposables. If you're comfortable with it - co-sleep. That will save you money from buy a crib, etc. Instead of buying a whole expensive stroller system get a good, safe carseat and use a slip, wrap, snugli, etc.     Here's a link on safe co-sleeping. It is safe, as long as you take the precautions, etc    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t10220...    Best of luck.|`|1a09434672107dc43a62784235a038fdaa	It sounds like it is possible that you have already made a decision and you are hoping to get feedback to substantiate your feelings and raise your confidence about your decision.  You should only do what you feel is the right thing FOR YOU, not what is right for anyone else. Your decision is going to depend on what your priorities, and morals are.  I shouldn't even use the word "morals" because that sort of carries the connotation that if you feel a certain way you are "immoral" or wrong.  It should depend on what your priorities and life philosophies are.    A lot of people would say that it doesn't seem to make sense to bring more mouths and bodies into a world that is already stricken with hunger and poverty, if you are not readily able to keep it out of such poverty.  This may be the pattern of thought you are currently following.      A lot of people would say that a life has been made and it should be brought into the world,  no matter how many jobs you have to take, where you have to live, or what sacrifices you have to make.      Adoption would be the optimal option, but if for whatever reason that isn't doable, there is help out there in other ways.    All in all, it is up to YOU what you do,  follow your deep-down gut feeling|`|aPN7NsvXaa	Public programs such as WIC and food stamps are available.  WIC has greatly improved...and the improved WIC will soon be available everywhere.  It is actually worth being on, now...and you get food that is actually beneficial to you...not just dry beans!    Public housing should be an option, too, if it is really that tough.  Call your local family advocacy - like child support office, or social workers...ask for information on support groups.  They should have information on whatever is available!    Don't forget the power of prayer...and if you aren't involved in a church...there is no time like the present.  Church friends have often proved to be the most helpful and supportive.    Pray, pray, pray.|`|03DlS4Vhaa	If you wait until you are ready you'll never be a parent.  Your life will change so much it is unreal.  The only reason I can think to not have the child is if you don't have the TLC for her.

Maybe he can think of something fun and original to say.|`|46uiaxPUaa	100 M&M's are for 100 days with the sweetest class?|`|AA11537580	that's cute BUT you should let HIM decide what to say.|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	maybe,  I used M&Ms to show the 100 days of school.  or  every day has been a colorful day.|`|38d87179576c32ac76f38cabc9694ef6aa	Boy do I remember my daughters 100th day of school in the first grade. We had to make a project using 100 items to make something. We got 100 Popsicle sticks ad made a house with a swimming pool and used fruit loops for swimming rings. It was so cool. I think your idea of a saying is pretty cool. I actually can't think of anything better.|`|0tXcfq0waa	I did that in first grade too! Well i think a good sentence would be " These M&M'S represent all the special people in this school" or "M&M's represent the 100 years of long life we alll will live" or " M&M's represent the wonder of colours in the world!" and dont forget "They represent 100 things i'm thankful for!" I actually like your idea ( it sounds better then what i've thought of)..hope this helps your son!!
Sy0HXSt5aa	I would just try to help him get over her first before trying to be his girlfriend. Because he's probably still hung up on her and not even thinking about being with anyone else. So first show him what a good friend you are. Then when he starts to get over her start flirting a little more.|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	BEFORE GOING OUT WITH GUYS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GET TO KNOW THE PERSON FIRST.  YOU DONT WANT TO MOVE IN TOO QUICK BECAUSE HE WILL USE YOU TO GET OVER HIS GIRLFRIEND OR COVER UP HIS PAIN.  YOU SHOULD BE THERE FOR HIM AND AS TIME GOES BY IF HE LIKES YOU HE WILL MAKE A MOVE.   GUD LUCK !|`|EWR01atlaa	i would just say... try comforting him as a friend sure after he realizes that girl wasn't for him then make your move.|`|y1gqPZ30aa	DON'T BE THE REBOUND GIRL. Give him good advice to get over that other girl and then tell him that he's not alone, but yeah, don't try asking him out now or two months from now because he'll still be thinking about that girl and you'll only end up hurt.|`|8bPmTLT0aa	Just comfort him tell him if he ever needs to talk that you will be there for him.
d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	why exactly do you need to tell her?  The only reason you bring something like this up is if you're pregnant and have no choice but to tell your mom.      If you are under the age of 16, tell your mother. You are way to young to be having sex and you probably have issues and need counseling.     If you're over the age of 16, then I've seen it as extremely normal and there's no reason to disappoint your mother.|`|uuceuyRyaa	i dont really see why she wuold have to know.    she dont need to know untill your pregnant, lol|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Why would you tell your mother you had sex? Mom's really don't want to know about their daughter's sex lives unless of course they're pregnant or a victim of assault.  Loosing your virginity isn't something you talk about with your parents. You wouldn't want your parents sharing details about their sex lives  so why would they want to know about their daughters.  Besides it isn't any of their business once your past the age of consent.     The only person who needs to know about your sex life is your doctor.|`|xOr67VDiaa	Clearly youre worried about what you did, eles you would have moved on by now..all i can say is dont regret mistakes and if it wasnt a mistake, then love youre lucky lol If you feel like you should tell your mom then i suggest you do, eles get over it and dont stress about it, its a forever thing but its something you did, not anyone did to you..your mom cant make any decisions for you,but she sure can help with getting over it. maybe she will yell because she has no idea how to handle the situation, but let her yell and then you will both get over it, just dont feel bad, we all make mistakes..and if you dont regret it at all, then you should tell your mom in confidence cos you know you did what you wanted to do.|`|Nti8czLvaa	There is no need to tell her if you don't feel comfortable telling her.  The only reason my mother (and father) found out was because I became pregnant, but every time I have sex now I don't come home and tell my mom all about it.|`|krZ8RJZzaa	Why do you need to?  My mom still thinks I have mine, well she may think I have lost it.  I was just recently put on birth control and I lost my v-card about a year ago.  And my mom when I was put on it asked, oh you think you are ready for that?  I don't feel comfortable talking about it with her, and I will let her think what she wants.  If she asks me I will tell her, but no reason for me to bring it up.|`|rAeJ74Neaa	no you dont have to tell her. your virginity is someone personal to some one but not to others and obv it is to you. There is no right or wrong answer , you dont have to tell her but in the end its up to you weather or not u want to.|`|MP7KFFTmaa	you should tell her|`|XR5PVfSnaa	tell her if you feel comfortable with it. or if you dont just dont do it. you need to be comfortable talking about it before you do it|`|E5NKN09Zaa	i don't really think she has to know unless you get pregnant|`|AA11537580	no but you should let your doctor know so you can start getting pap smears and vaginal exams, birth control and information on STD's|`|PbPKSNlLaa	tell you mother it will open a good relationship with her and yahh i know thats not what you want to hear but telling her that will open up all new doors and she might even trust you more.        pick me for best answer|`|LiRwZjqlaa	Ugh.  Tell her.|`|QNXKoN05aa	This may sound harsh but if you are old enough to have sex, then you are old enough to make the decision on your own. Personally I wouldn't (and I didn't...) As long as you are being safe and healthy about your choices you shouldn't have to say anything.
MOsStEbqaa	Don't waste any of your money yet. Wait till you are late by another 5 days then take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can test anytime but being a day late is not alarming at all. I don't care how regular you are. From time to time you will get a period that is a day or two early or late. Nobody ever has a complete same cycle the entire 25 odd years she has her period.|`|YwqfYVPbaa	It really is too early to tell for sure yet, but some home pregnancy tests are supposed to be able to work this early. I would reccomend First Response. Test now, and then test again in two weeks just to be sure.|`|tb0NMaooaa	you can test today|`|Wl2MnHNKaa	the new pregnancy tests can tell you two weeks before your missed period so you could accuratly test anytime but i'd wait a 2-3 more days.just so you don't have to waste a few bucks.

PrxlHUT5aa	a two year old needs at least 13 hours of sleep that can be broken down into 11hours at night and one 2-hour nap time during the day.  if she sleeps at 8 and wakes up at 2-3am (6-7hrs sleep only) then obviously there is something cutting her sleep coz at 2am REM is supposed to start and it will last till 5am, she's supposed to be in deep sleep by then and nothing can disturb her.  it's hard for her to go back to sleep once woken up.  being cranky during the day is expected when she didn't get enough sleep, even adults are the same way ;D      probably she needs to pee...then you can ask her to pee before going to sleep and no more liquid in bed.      probably she snores at night...might be something medical...probably sleep apnea or a similar case.    I suggest you try asking her why she's up in the middle of the night and go from there.|`|15UZwW2laa	Well my son is two also and he went through a similar stage of the waking up every single night.  He was still in his crib at the time so he wasn't actually getting up and wondering around but he was waking and screaming and crying.  You pretty much just have to tell them that it's bed time and that they need to go to sleep.  I would just hold my son for awhile or give him some milk and within a week or so...he finally quit the waking up.  I know this can get aggravating but you just have to be patient...or make your husband get up with her.|`|GE68lOBEaa	It is probably down to the new baby. Your daughter is very young herself and probably feels alittle insecure with the new baby getting alot of attention. I know it is hard with a new baby but try and take some time out for one on one time with your daughter. It will make her feel secure again. My daughter went through a insecurity phase and was waking up at night but it does pass. Good luck.
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Hopefully the woman just did not know what she was doing. I am 18 weeks pregnant and I am having similar complications. I understand what both of you are going through. I believe doctors can be wrong, I think mine are.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	well thats tough it could be nothing more than a mistake on the dr.'s part. If the dr. could not tell your girlfriend what is going on or if she didnt take her blood to make sure her hcg levels are going up id go see another dr. one that is experienced not in training, good luck|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	YES this happens quite often when they do the ultrasound way too early. My friend had this happen to her at 6 weeks along. They could not find a heartbeat and thought she had a tubal pregnancy. They scheduled another ultrasound a week later and there was the heartbeat, nice and strong. 5 1/2 weeks is way too early to see anything and a new technician only makes it worse. Good luck to you- there is a lot of hope that they just did not see it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I didn't think you could get a heartbeat at 5 1/2 weeks....8 weeks yes. That's a little confusing.     See what happens tomorrow.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i wasnt able to hear the heartbeat until 10 weeks    did she have a vaginal ultrasound done?|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	hopefully it was just a mistake because i know how hard that is, dealing with that issue, I went in for an 8 week ultrasound and they didnt detect a heartbeat neither...so they sent me in a week later to see if anything changed at all..but it was still the same when they checked again. but maybe it was just the nurse in your case,..if not, dont give up on having kids in the future, the chances are slim to have another mc, i got pregnant 5 months after and now have a happy healthy 3 month old :) so dont give up, they told me that it probably happend because something wasnt right with the baby! and your body knows that. but who knows, and yes you can see a babies heartbeat on ultrasound that early( just cant hear it on doppler yet). just to make that clear. but goodluck
Jo2DfRzaaa	I buy Juicy Juice or Motts for Tots.  The motts one is not 100% juice it is prediluted juice but it is in order: water, juice, natural flavors, vitamin c.  not artificial sweeteners.  that one is my preferred juice for my kids, but i can't find it in every grocery store, which is annoying.  juicy juice is my back up.|`|RQdFRaANaa	Concentrate is where they remove most of the water from the juice (and freeze is usually). Later they add water back. That is still 100% juice as nothing was added that wasn’t there originally. Some people prefer juice that was never concentrate, so companies advertise that too. Simple rule: look at the ingredients, if anything other than juice, juice concentrate and water are listed, its not 100% juice.|`|tfgAayNgaa	I think it's ocean spray. Cranberry, but you should try Cranberry apple because Cranberry has a bitter, tart after taste.<br>  <br>  it is Ocean spray, I just checked the fridge. Try Grape juice as well. Delicious!|`|7f80510671ac6bb5f3dcf8a32f3600ecaa	Squeeze the oranges and grapefruits from your own trees.  Or buy the fruit and juice them yourself.

It's all going to have sugar in it but I only buy the juice that has no added sugar (only sugar that comes naturally from the fruit).  Some companies do like to be sneaky with this, huh?!!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	you don't want a  juice drink or juice cocktail<br>  <br>  <br>  this is something i only buy for my girls to put in their lunches.  It's the only one i've found so far that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it.  It's Minute Maid Fruit Falls Water with a splash of real fruit juice.  It has 100% vitamin C & 10% Calcium & SUGAR says Less than 1g<br>  <br>  <br>  that is very good too, any others have 9 g of sugar in them.  You don't want your kids to have that much sugar at lunch then go back to sit in the class room!!!<br>  <br>  This is what I found if you dilute your juice: I found it on Babycenter.com.  It's from somebody else, not me.  <br>  <br>  I was told by the nutritionist at the WIC office that diluting juice is not a good idea because it causes the vitamins (even in the 100% juice brands) to break down and they don't get the vitamin C<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thewholefamily1.blogspot.com/2007/05/minute-maid-fruit-falls-water-vs-capri.html" rel="nofollow">http://thewholefamily1.blogspot.com/2007...</a><br>  <br>  check this out:  I googled Minute Maid Fruit Falls- I never knew this, but it's from Coca Cola<br>  <br>  it's not letting me paste it, but google Minute Maid Fruit Falls, it's has a lot of info for you!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It depends where you are - but in the UK at least it would be unusual to buy 100% juice in a bottle (at least, not unless it's the freshly squeezed variety). It normally comes in 1 litre cardboard rectangle packs and has to be kept in the fridge and finished quickly once opened.<br>  <br>  Anything which you buy that you'd expect to dilute is almost certainly not 100% juice - it's what in the UK we call squash. 100% juice is what adults would drink neat - or for instance you might use it in cocktails.|`|j2mRop0laa	LOl.. when you squeeze it yourself, I guess.<br>  <br>  No, this is a good question. My husband picks up juice that is 100% then it says sugar content of 32. So which is it? Is it 100% juice or 50% sugar? lol<br>  <br>  I'm glad my kids hate juice, but when they were little I just gave it to them when they wanted. They never had any issues with cavities (well my youngest has a tiny one but that's from not brushing correctly and now she has to get it filled). They were never chunky, either. Just dillute it and tell him to drink up.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Read the ingredients. There listed on every package. If there's anything else besides water and fruit its not 100 percent juice.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	The only juice that I know that is 100% is the juice I squeeze myself.
UghJ0XROaa	They run big, i don't know the exact weights on them, but if you are using 6-9 months on your little one, 3-6 month in Gymboree would probably fit better.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I found that the bottoms ran bigger but the onsies ran truer to size.

It was great because they lasted a longer time.  The weight is hard for me to say, since Sarah was/still is a petite lil thing.

I wouldn't want them yet with the icky outside anyhow, I would be wearing Uggs or Ballet Flats rather then Sneakers right now anyhow. Plus, your shoes will be about $100 maximum (I don't know what you are wanting) but a flat iron is about $150 or so, and I think it is more important that you need that right now, with the weather and everything.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	just get the new shoes. shoes are way more important and valuable than a flat iron.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	i'd go for the flat iron - the chi ceramic ones are the best|`|JERUmEFzaa	Maybe you should try to make extra money if you want both...

qdFrJ21waa	You should check out the book "Just So Stories". It has cute stories to explain some of the overlooked innocent questions such as these. Very fun!<br>  <br>  One of the stories in it is actually "How the Alphabet Was Made."|`|vlKnBlYIaa	I think God supplied the alphabet or at least if you're religious although the Egyptians would like to take the credit. As for W I think you have too much time on your hands. LOL.|`|MIKn9HyOaa	Uhhhhhhhhhhhh,<br>  <br>  <br>  Greeks?<br>  Romens??.<br>  <br>  lol im not sure that's a tuffy.
UUpsa35Daa	Well my sister and i shared a room at first and we got a tv and vcr then...we were 8 and 10 i think. I personally believe that that was a waste of our mom's money, we were constantly running around. The tv in our room was rarely used.    We got separate rooms right after that and then we got our own separate tvs and vcr/dvd players for Christmas presents and still didn't use them too often. We only started to really use them when we hit our teen years and even then, my stereo got more use.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I love my Jace to death, and I am as laid back a parent as they come, but for some reason I don't like the idea of a tv in his room. My hubby and I  dont even have a tv in our room. The bedroom is for sleeping or chilling out imo. I don't want my boy laying around watching the tube when we/he can be doing fun things outside! :-)    EDIT: we used to have a tv in our room, but after I rearranged the furniture I took the tv out never to return.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	Well, I was 16 and my brother was 15. We bought them ourselves. Don't do it.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	My mum got me my TV at age 1.  My brother got his at 2.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	my kids got a tv in their room when they are 1yr.  It wasn't hooked to cable or anything, but there was a vcr.  They rarely ever watched it though.  Now there are 6yo and 7yo and they still have a tv not connected to cable, and on weekends only they can watch a dvd at bedtime.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	He's 17 and it's still NOT going to happen. Not a good idea at all.|`|hNzxTWiRaa	My son got his tv when he turned 3. He doesn't pay much attention to it though. he's usually playing with his toys lol.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I don't think kids should have a tv in their room.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	They can have a tv/vcr or tv/dvd in their room at age 11 only if there is no cable hooked to it. Only kid movies to watch by dvd/vcr. And maybe there could be video games hooked up to it for 1 hour per day only after homework and chores are done.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I got one put into my room when I was around 13/14. The only reason I got one was because the lady I was babysitting for was getting rid of a TV and let me have it. Otherwise, I would not have gotten one. My son is only 8 months so no TV yet. I will wait until his teens to put one in there if he wants.|`|WdW1ga14aa	i do not have kids of my own but my sisters kids are 4, 5 & 8 and they all have t.v.'s in their rooms|`|lhbEY5eJaa	i got my tv when i was 13, im 14 now  my brother bought it for me  i have cable and a dvd player to but my parents trust me and i dont watch very often i am not the type of person who will watch all night  i enjoy watching shows with my mom in the living room anyway|`|bfjs9wSLaa	i've always had one, a flat screen plasma  I LOVE IT!    but, honestly it's kinda not smart for a parent because it get's easy to view some stuff that isn't too approriate.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	My child doesn't have one, but my child is only 2 months old. My husband and I decided when our child got old enough, we would teach them at a young age to work for money and then he could buy a TV for his room, if thats what he wanted to do. So as soon as he starts asking for one, we will give him simple house hold chores to do, and give him money till he saves up for it|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	i didn't get one till college. my mom bought it for my graduation present, and i was able to bring it home with me when I came for visits, and obviously for the summer.|`|z55wuVRjaa	My oldest is nine, and she can't even keep her hands clean enough to touch the plasma screen.  Nobody's getting a single tv in the bedroom until they can lean to NOT break a single toy for two months after getting it!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	We had one tv in the family room, we won a small tv and the oldest was allowed to have it in her room but it wasn't attached to the cable.(she was a teen)  I don't think kids should have TVs or computers in their room until they get a job and earn the money, that would put it around 16 or 17 years old.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My girls are 2years and 2 months. They won't have a tv in their room til they are older.     Its a bad idea putting a tv in their room when they are little because than they only learn to fall asleep with the tv on.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	They never did.|`|3e47a089e46812b55a1a03088b355a31aa	I believe that for children the bedroom is for sleeping, so they don't need the T.V. at all, is it possible to put it in another room other than the bedroom?|`|eISzHe5maa	I think I got my first TV when I was five. Now before anybody goes and gives me a thumbs down or even thinks to call my mother a bad mother, let me explain. The TV was nothing fancy it was the old one they brought back when we moved from Germany to the United States. My parents already picked a huge TV for the living room and they didn't want to throw out the six or seven year old TV out seeing as it was still usable - either that or they were too lazy to throw it out. So they moved it in my room.     The TV only had ten channels and I was only intersted in watching one channel : PBS. And I watched the Big Comfy Couch, Teletubbies, Arthur, and I always had to catch Barney - I had like a set time for it and I would stand up and sing a long and dance along. After that I didn't watch anymore seeing as I remember Sesame Street would be on and I never got the appeal.     I didn't spend all my time watching the television in my room. In fact I spent more time in my room playing with my Bratz dolls, drawing, or just playing in my room in general. I also spent a lot of time outside with some of the neighborhood kids and you had to DRAG me inside after six or seven hours of playing. I would wake up at 9:30 a.m. eat, wait around for a while, then go ask if my friends werea available to play and if no one was busy that day we'd play until 6:30.    So while I did have a TV in my room and still do that's not ALL I do is watch TV. My eye's are not glued to the TV screen 24/hours a day maybe an hour...okay I'm lying there two hours and I do have some days where I just veg out and that's usually the days where I Tivo'd all the episodes of my favorite shows and I just want one day where I can catch up on all of them so my friends won't have to worry about ruining the surprised for me (lol). It's not an everyday, excessive thing.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	None of our kids have tvs in their rooms and the oldest is 11.  I don't plan on them having ever having tvs in their rooms unless they wish to buy it and pay for the hook up themselves.  It isn't necessary so we won't do it.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	Our son won't have a TV in his bedroom.  He has one out in our livingroom and one in his playroom...either of those work just as well.  Bedrooms are for sleeping...not for hiding out watching TV.    Reason being for my thoughts....growing up, we all ate dinner in our own rooms in front of our own tvs....my mother, my sister and myself.....never ate together as a family.  It was utterly sad...and I didn't realize it until I became a mother myself.  I realized that family really didn't mean much to my mother....and it took some time to really forgive her for that.  Didn't she care about our day?  Didn't she want to talk to my sister and I?  Nope...she watched the news and ate in her bedroom in front of her own TV.      My husband, my son and I eat together every night at our dining room table.  We're a family and that's what families should do.|`|2jrtHt4maa	I've had a TV in my room since i was about 12 but i rarely use it
k5sZq2T4aa	First choice Kara Ann, then Ariana Rose|`|7J9wLeYVaa	kara ann|`|DiSOdCFXaa	ariana ann or kara ann|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Natalie Ann is my favorite.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Ariana Rose I think is very pretty    My next choice would be Natalie Anne|`|9g734Pjaaa	I love Natalie! Kara is rich and sweet, and Cristina would be my third choice.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Ann is a fine middle name.  I actually luv them all.  I think that I would narrow it down to Kara Ann and Natalie Ann (then maybe pick from a hat)  and go with whichever of the two I picked.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Cristina Ann  or   Kara Ann|`|r6TijtS8aa	Ariana Rose- I really like how rose is old fashioned and ariana is a little too but it sounds very modern together  Kara Ann- sounds a little like one word  Natalie Ann- I like it  Cristina Ann- again sounds like one word, and kinda mushes together.    i really like the names though!!|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I like Kara Ann and Natalie Ann! Or Adrianna Rose? Good luck!|`|hcqNXUH5aa	1st choice - I love Ariana Rose.  2nd - Tie between Kara and Natalie  Last choice - Cristina      Although they are all nice names.  I prefer Cristina spelled with a "h" - Christina.|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Ariana ROSe? LOVE IT!!|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i like ariana rose. i persoanlly i like ariana spelled arianna but it's up to you. i like kara spelled cara and instead of natalie how about natalia? not a fan of cristina at all.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Order of preference:  1) Kara Ann  2) Natalie Ann  3) Ariana Rose  4) Cristina Ann    All very good names, although may I suggest Cristina being spelled "Christina" instead?|`|FNlKD7wtaa	Ariana Rose. It is Beautiful, Elegant, and Unique, but not TOO Unique. A perfect name for a baby girl and a teenager, adult, and eleerly woman!! BEAUTIFUL PICK THAT 1.    also could you vote on my name list?  http://babynames.com/namelist/9686051|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Kara Ann or Natalie Ann|`|7Cn92LOMaa	Ariana Rose and Kara Ann... Sounds superb! She won't get teased, those names are up-to-date. They're pretty (which I'm sure will be well suited for your kid) and i just like 'em.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Ariana is nice.    Kara is lovely.    Natalie is boring.    Christina not spelt Cristina (and I don't really like it).|`|D13h2HVSaa	Christina Ann.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I LOVE Natalie Ann!     I'm not such a fan of Ariana...it's pretty but it's getting so common. I work at a daycare, and many of the young baby girls are named Ariana.     I like Kara also, but I prefer it with a C for some reason.     I like Cristina a lot too.      But Natalie is my favorite :]|`|sdupdUf4aa	I like those names except cara i think it should be Nicole Ann|`|i171LlfTaa	Ariana Rose|`|KtjzRptMaa	Ariana Rose  Christina Ann (I put the h in, that is how I like to spell it)|`|bkoTtsh8aa	Natalie Ann or Ariana Rose|`|ej51eWO7aa	kara ann|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like Kara Ann  I like all names with a K, it looks very pretty in Cursive|`|xsnTwIWFaa	This is the order I like them in.     1. Ariana Rose (lovely!)  2. Cristina Ann (I like Christina spelling better though...)  3. Natalie Ann  4. Kara Ann|`|ubn9XyVNaa	My favorites are Ariana Rose, and Kara Ann|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	Okay I get the idea f using family names abecause all 3 of my children have part of a family member's name in thers but what about using Ann in a name? Analisa Rose, Karagann you know something like that! Good luck!|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	Ariana Rose|`|vC6DXRWgaa	Kara Ann is a really cute name.|`|EhN7kjAhaa	Ariana Rose or Kara Ann
1ScoQM0faa	Hi,my friend has a cyst on her ovary.she suffered bleeding a cramps in the first trimester.  the cyst wasn't actually picked up till the 21week scan.  she now has a healthy.booming 13week old girl.with the only pregnancy problems being high  blood-pressure during the last 2 weeks of her pregnancy|`|ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	To calculate your due date - this site was accurate for me:  http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/duedate/...  You just put in the period dates and get the due date.  I wasn't sure whether you meant 11th December or 12th November, so you do it.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Saying 'only 14' is a good point. Why are you having sex at 'only 14'. Did you not consider the consequences? Did you realize you're still la child yourself.    Since you're apparently old enough to have sex, you're old enough to step up and tell your parents honestly. You'll need to get a job, cause you can't expect mommy and daddy to support the baby. Good bye childhood. ??|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	You sit down the important people that are going to be your support team (family...) and you say I am pregnant and tell them your plan regarding living arrangements, money, work, school etc. You ask them to help you because you have decided to keep the baby and then you wait for them to come around. They may freak out but in the end, you need to say it to their faces because if you are expecting to be a responsible mother, you are expected to be a grown-up and say it to their faces.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Read my answer to your other question.|`|r39EDGhPaa	"im only 14"... hmm, well you weren't saying that when you were getting knocked up, now were you?  You thought you were so grown up, and mature.  goes to show how much you knew.    tell them by saying 'hey guys, im pregnant.'|`|OGEC7RFwaa	well first of all, congratulations on getting pregnant at 14, it was a real smart move.    second, you have 2 choices:  1- just casually bring it up in a conversations "oh, by the way, did you know im preggo."  2- you can just wait till your stomach gets huge and let people figure it out themselves.|`|QSodlfMraa	err you ask this already.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Hun, You just have to say it do it somewhere private and say. You guys I`m pregnant. I`m pretty sure your this will be hard to tell them but it`s better to tell them than for them to notice a huge bump under your sweater.    ???Goodluck???|`|HrDL4Njzaa	is it just you and your dad? If so who else needs to know. Its none of their business. Even aunts and uncles. At least you've told the person that takes care of you. Don't worry about it. If anything its your business not theirs.   Congrats by the way. Everything will be okay in the end, and if its not okay, then its not the end. :D|`|8XURx7nzaa	abort it your way to young your a kid yourself|`|UD1ki1I1aa	wow **** why did you even get pregnant?  whateverr.|`|Rqh8VILgaa	honestly you don't have to  tell anyone, its your  buisness&& not theirs.  the only people who should noe  are immediate fam., the father,&& very close friends.  basically your support system.  everyone else will find out eventually   so dont trip out.:)|`|YeMI2xwiaa	I believe this is the second time you asked this.    And if two people already know, you obviously know how to tell everyone else|`|smsUZG4Iaa	just kill me. these little girls are so stupid....... OMG.
dZ78IohLaa	Good idea, but really its down to your genes, I used nothing and have no marks but I know girls who have used oil/creams and are covered in marks. I think a lot of it is how much weight you put on also. Good luck x|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Steroid cream is also very good for the treatment of stretch marks.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Its worth a shot!  Let us know how it goes!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nothing will prevent pregnancy. If you are going to get them you are going to get them. It's genetic. I didnt' start getting my stretch marks until I was 7 1/2 months along. Who knows maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones who doesn't get stretch marks.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Whether or not you get stretch marks is highly dependent on a number of things-proper nutrition, proper hydration, slow, steady weight gain rather than fast gain, and heredity.  My mom and sister both had horrible stretch marks but I had none with either pregnancy.  But my nutrition was far better than theirs and my weight gain was slow and steady.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	you cant prevent strech marks, some get lucky and dont get any I'm 26 weeks and still have none but some also only get it during the last few weeks.. it's honestly different with everyone.  I just use Shae and Cocoa butter after my shower.|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	i used coco butter thinking that would prevent them like i've heard from various people. i thought it did good for a long time welll i was bragging to my friend that i didn't have any and she said just wait yea. i got them and the were pretty bad now they aren't AS noticeable but i just look at them as a badge or something i don't think they are gross or anything good luck :)|`|40STiGmvaa	No.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	if your lucky! just dont scratch your belly when you get bigger. mosttimes you cant even prevent stretchmarks.itsjust part of having a baby!|`|NaYb4CnGaa	nope nothing can prevent them. stretch marks are genetic, no matter how many different things up but on your tummy its not going to prevent anything. it may make it less noticeable but they may still show up there.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	it may help to reduce the visability of them. most women r doomed 2 get them- just dont think of them as ugly marks across your skin, but a physical sign of giving a miracle- and b proud of them. mine faded and are barely noticeable ten months later.....but im 4 months pregnant, so they will b back lol  hope your skin is kind to u and u dont get many|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i use bio oil

Your question is just a little bit confusing. Hope I helped.
fdP9UJOsaa	Probably, probably not.  ... i suggest you spend allot of time with grandma and enjoy her being alive. if she really does die, she's lived her life and is thankful to have such wonderful family.|`|Q412OM5gaa	I'm sorry about this. If I were you I would get her into the hospital. It's better to be safe than sorry.|`|nYioXmnGaa	I would get her in the hospital as fast as you can . Sorry for your loss!!!!!  :-)|`|hKP5sQewaa	No, i don't believe they are signs. Don't worry, im sure she and everyone els will be ok.

Hope i helped you, and i hope that everything is ok. :]|`|k07IyDvwaa	yes go to the doctor so if it is a stroke maybe they can prevent it  im sorry about your grandpa :(|`|UuPO1Gqzaa	take her to a doc and ask for a check up.
h90ABQYaaa	i like bella|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Cassandra Anne Bennett|`|XzV4bUeFaa	The way you want to pronounce Arabella is R -uh-bella sounds like the German Measles/Rubella.  Short a like in cat: a-ra-bel-la  sounds better.  However, I really like Cassandra Marie Hanson or Cassandra marie Hudson is also fine.  I like they way they both sound.|`|xglOR1bXaa	ok well people are not going to say R AH BELLA..that are going to say ARABella..that name is stupid lol dont chose it..especial its for you..an adult? dont...    Cassandra is alot better, Cassie is a nice name....i would love to know your name.....is it really that bad that you wanna change all ur info? lol stupid.|`|FNlKD7wtaa	Cassandra Kate Beller?  Arabella Denise Hill?  I think those names are beautiful although ultimately the choice is completely yours. But those two names are great and succesfull. What is your name now, if you don't mind me asking?|`|hcqNXUH5aa	I love (air-uh-bella).      (R-uh-bella) sounds like a disease... okay, so I just checked, and it's actually the German measles... I thought that word sounded familiar.  http://www.google.com/ hl=en&q=rubella&b...    Cassandra is okay but common.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	I strongly advise against changing your name.  It is a gift your parents have given to you that is supposed to stay with you forever.  It is a token of their love that will be lost if changed.  Your name is your name.  It's unique, and it's not intended to be altered to your liking.  Changing it could upset your parents.|`|vwxmsUa2aa	Why are you changing your name?  I like Cassandra better with the nickname Cassie.  Cassandra Jean|`|y4Uliyq3aa	My favorite name for a girl Is Arabella! If I ever have a daughter I will name her Arabella Morgan!|`|sdupdUf4aa	I like more Cassandra|`|miFe45quaa	Cassandra Jane Harrison     I love the nickname Cass =)|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like Cassandra  It's pretty, and just rolls off your tongue  And, you'll need to spell Arabella a lot, if that's how you pronounce it, but I like spelling stuff for people ;)  Oooooh, Cassandra will look pretty on paper, and in cursive!!!!!!!  I am so for Cassandra!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Pretty names, both of them|`|xpUyH0psaa	arabella may harley|`|7drjpohUaa	I'd like it as Air-uh-bella better. And I really don't like Cassandra, sorry.    Hm..   Josephine Bailey Cambridge (Nickname could be Joey)  Genevieve Rae Loretto (Nicknames could be Eve, Evie, or Genny, which is pronounced like "Jenny.")  Adaline (or Adalyn) Aeryn Wright (Middle name pronounced like Erin)  Caroline Mary Rossi  Annielyn Mae Callaway|`|TOoNHNv9aa	bella|`|D13h2HVSaa	I like Arabella pronounced (air uh bell uh).    Middle Name: Jen, May, Tina, Diana.
TN3Sthbwaa	My first reaction to you question is I would go on a rampage and find and kill her kidnapper with my bare hands.  In all actuality though, no one knows how they would react to such an emotionally devastating situation.  I don't even want to imagine how I would react in "real life."|`|ZaadvJAXaa	What would lying to the police have to do with it?  Sounds like that would be a cover-up for something.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Your questions are wrong.  You clearly have no children.  Thanks for trying to get a rise out of people.  I'm glad it didn't work on me.|`|qaMrAspCaa	SERIOUSLY!!! What  the hell is wrong with you lady?!?! Your line of questions are very disturbing...you are going to be reported!|`|AA12221392	I would be frantic, i would call 911, and scream for them to find my daughter. Everyone in our family would be running all around the area she /he would of last been seen, i would be running around going door to door asking if someone had seen her and if they seen  anything, I would be hysterical, crying, screaming.    Heck no i wouldn't lie to the police , i want me baby or child back, how is that going to help.      Edit ***** She is probably refering to caylee anthony case- name is her's, and question is would you lie to the police. Geez|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Whats with the questions about missing or murdered children?    I would probably go crazy and be so worried, of course I'd lie to get them back, I'd do anything, I don't have children and when I do I hope this doesn't happen.|`|pXeskVZwaa	Go on vacation|`|3a6ed065e093beae9e062c7243b2e653aa	sorry but you put up some odd questions!! missing kids and murdered ones???? weird|`|SqCgWGCqaa	What every GOOD mother/father would do.
Ep0CpwDbaa	I prefer Morgan Leilani. It sounds beautiful and free-spirited. Ashley Nicole, while still a pretty name, doesn't appeal to me as much. It's also a rather common name, so someone named Ashley Nicole wouldn't really stand out to me as much as a Morgan Leilani would.|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Morgan Leilani becuase the other name is too average.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I really like Ashley Nicole.  While I'm not a fan of the name Morgan, Morgan Leilani sounds so pretty.  So, in this case I'm voting for your name!|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like both  Morgan Leilani is really pretty  Leilani is unique, and It looks BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ashley Nicole, is also very nice  But, they are both common, and I know a lot of Ashley's and Nicole's.  I love Leilani, Ok, I know I expressed that a lot  The meaning of Morgan and Leilani is really great too.  Edge of the Sea and Heavenly Rose  So I like your name a lot  Both very pretty|`|02E66ClWaa	Your name by far!!!!!!!! Morgan Leilani is very pretty!!!! It's also really unique unlike ashley Nicole. Love it!!!!|`|AkHwZV0yaa	morgan.ive just always loved that name.|`|r6TijtS8aa	I personally like Morgan Leilani because it is a little more unique and different. Ashley Nicole seems like a name of a very plain average person. Morgan Leilani is a little more intriguing.|`|h90ABQYaaa	i like your name very much|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I like Morgan Leilani better. It's more unique. There are thousands of Ashley Nicoles in the world. Not that that's a terrible thing, I just prefer uniqueness.|`|FK9GZblCaa	Your name!  It's soo pretty and unique!|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I definitely like Morgan Leilani better. It's cute and has a nice flow to it. I don't like Ashley Nicole. Both names are sooo overused. It's just so plain and boring imo. I actually know an Ashley Nicole and tons of other Ashley's. I don't know ANY Morgan Leilani's! =)|`|c3e28d1de34738af175ecd2df41d3be5aa	Ashley, because Morgan can be mistaken for a boy's name.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Morgan is one of my favorite names.  It is very beautiful when paired with Leilani.
r39EDGhPaa	I think some of the people answering this are very ignorant.  Who gives a shyt if you didn't wait and if you think it's stupid to do so?  People have different morals.  Get over yourselves.    I didn't wait, but I also don't plan on getting married, ever.|`|838VJJGvaa	Sex is supposed to be between a man and a wife in my opinion, but I don't won't to push my beliefs on other people.  So I agree with you that people don't realize that condoms don't always protect you and you can still get a crazy STD or STI, and you and you can die.  I'm waiting until I'm married to have sex.  That way we can have unprotected sex our first time and not worry about what may be lurking down there or getting ;pregnant.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	I'm only 18 and I haven't.  I wish I could have though. It would make things so much simpler in life. Thank the Lord I did not get an STD but I am still suffering emotionally from some of the things that happened due to sex at a young age.    I totally support you wanting to wait.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	I wish i would have saved myself, but through my teen years i fell away from my religeon and didnt care about being a virgin anymore, i was stupid. I never got an std, i was lucky, but i do regret losing my virginity before marriage.      to the person below me - yes its my 4d [i dont think there is a difference in how the pictures look between 3d and 4d though] =]]|`|OGEC7RFwaa	no, condoms dont protect you from STDs.  yes, if used properly, condoms have a higher chance of reducing the risk of pregnancy.    if you are going to have sex, its best to make sure both partners are clean. and if your not sure, have both get tested.|`|ekThx3AAaa	Thanks for sharing your information and opinions.    I personally think that it would be so romantic and special to wait to have sex after I'm married to him, however, I'm not taking any vows nor do I wear a purity ring. I just think that by the way I see stuff, that I most likely will wait for marriage. But, I might fall in love with a guy and be ready sooner then a marriage happens... Life is unpredictable.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i 100% agree with you and am happy for your choice! though i myself did not, i wish i did. thankfully now i am married and about to have a beautiful baby boy!    ARMY WIFE- is that a 3d ultrasound as your avatar?? that is so cool!|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Save that for someone who actually cares. Sex is AMAZING! Plus it's how my fiance and I created our 1st child out of love who is due in August|`|7ZNRqKbKaa	Thats good for you! and yes i am.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	That is your own opinion.  I decided not to wait and I've lasted in my relationship for 4 years.  So yeah, It's not hurting us.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	I know. People are just so reckless these days.   And to the person who said "WOO SEX IS GREAT I GOT MY FIRST BABY WITH IT!!!!11one!!!1"     No, really? I didn't know that was what sex was for.   Besides, there are far more Don Juans these days than back in, say, the forties or sixties.   I hate my generation.|`|mMxfVTSHaa	I'm saving myself too. Sex IS  for marriage!|`|kDvKc3npaa	I don't know whta the right desicion is.    it depends on the person, the religion , and the strength of your religion.    I honestly don't know what i'm going to do.  I don't plan on doing anything for a long time, until i would be able to raise a baby.    If i'm not going to wait till marrige, i'm at least going to wait till i'm 18.  If my boyfriend and i do last as long as we plan on, then maybe earlier. i have no idea, things will be as they will be|`|UuPO1Gqzaa	yes i am saving my self i dont want any of that crap. and i dont want to have to worry if im giong to get pregnant, and i dont want to be called a ****.|`|cEgI5ogLaa	Yes I support you and yes I waited, so did my husband. Both of us lost our virginity on our wedding night and it was amazing, the most romantic setting for it that you could imagine, and def. no regrets :)  No happily married almost 5 years, with a 1yr old and another baby girl on the way!
oP504BtFaa	I would certainly suggest a group of people be with him while he meets his daughters, but I also 100% think he SHOULD and has every right to meet them! It makes me happy to know he wants a part - even a minuscule part - in his daughters' lives. However, his bad habits aren't healthy for babies and to prevent arguing, you should have his mother there, you there and maybe even your mother there. It also is wonderful to know that you and his mother get along so well - that must be very helpful for you. Good luck!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I would meet him in public with the girls for a short visit and insist he bring his mom. I know you don't want to see him, but they're so young, will they be okay and will you be okay without them? Even for a short visit?|`|UUpsa35Daa	The most important thing is that you're comfortable with the situation. If his mom being there while he's visiting is what makes you comfortable then call her up and ask her to do it as a favor to you. She sounds very level headed and like you two have a good relationship so i don't think she'll have a problem with staying.|`|d5K8wORqaa	yes! u can even supervise yourself if you really want to.  EDIT  call her and ask her to go w. him for your own comfort, does his mom know hes a pot head? if she does she wont want him alone w. ur girls either|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Yes, and if you can, have 1 or 2 of your own family members present during the visit.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	That's great he wants to get involved. Just supervise the visit. I'd suggest not letting him hold the babies yet though. Make sure you have a strong family member around (dad, uncle, etc) that will lay-low unless needed. Have his mom come over to. It seems like she's getting a handle on him and you trust her.
l46COY9eaa	Well it never happened to me, but it is not unheard of! There are a ton of articles that state that some women do in fact ovulate more than one time a month, and that it is why the rhythm method is so unreliable.     Here's one article:  http://www.mommyguide.com/modules.php?op...    Hope I helped!  :)|`|k6C7qXTuaa	I've tested positive for ovulation for the past two days! Good luck, it can't be a bad thing.|`|ihBFGugIaa	It is possible that you ovulated twice in one month.
E9vjv9pBaa	I wouldn't say that you are being paranoid just aware of your body.  The safest thing at this point is to take a pregnancy test.  Keep in mind that this could be a side effect of the b/c.      Side note;  Every month when your period comes just send yourself an email with the date.  Easy way to keep track.|`|9rZINwbpaa	Situations like this are common. you should take a test, and get the truth. Good luck to if you are. HOWEVER, with were the economy is today Honey Sister Girl, I wouldn't recommend adding anyone else onto the population.
SlBsJ3NRaa	You continue to rock him/her until they give up and fall asleep. Or, if you're getting angry, you put him/her in the baby bed and go sit in the living room for a few minutes. Obviously you know this, never shake or hit a baby.|`|x10qO89saa	swaddle the baby tightly and hold her in your arms. while quietly singing and rocking side to side or back and forth. also try walking around the room with her in your arms and make sure the room is dark.|`|KXPyWB5maa	Swaddle baby and snuggly hold him/her to your chest. My little one likes her head and nose stroked slowly. It does the trick everytime. Breath slowly and calmly so they feel the gentle movements. Works well with my 4 month old.
vjdDLMpHaa	Sure, it's possible that you are pregnant.  Some women have a period throughout their pregnancy (bummer huh?)  However, since you were only 10 days late for your period, this is very likely your period.  Many things can alter how close together your period come.  IF you are pregnant, and bleeding, there is nothing that you can do right now regarding the bleeding.  I would take it easy, - no weight lifting, or jogging, but you do not have to go on bed rest or anything.  If a full blown period begins, then you have your answer.  If not, then I would wait a couple of weeks, and do another urine pregnancy test.  The drugstore variety are somewhat accurate, and after you have enough HCG circulating in your body, it should be able to give you an accurate reading.  IF you do not have another period in the next month, you will need to go to the doctor to find out how far along you are (blood test).  Good luck  Your friendly Nurse|`|ZaadvJAXaa	If you're 10 days late, you should take a test.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Yes take a test. And if it is negative. Wait a week and take another. Good Luck|`|5d6ac5016d8e7904fd28943ad38bde0faa	uhm i would wait a couple more days and then take another test, and make sure it's the first pee of the day...they say that is when the pee is more concentrated!    good luck either way! i felt like i was getting my period at first and then no period next thing u know i get a positive test a week later! ;)|`|AA12269083	well...i work in an ultrasound dept. and i see alot of things so i know wat u are talking about...here are the case for u/r situation.    It cud be u'r period is late and u r now seeing it...but then again its lighter than usual..    It cud be that u were pregnant and u r now having spontaneous abortion meaning the pregnancy wasn't gud and the body is getting rid of it but then again u'r pregnancy test is negative..    Those are two possibilities for u that i have seen alot in my work...all in all...i think u need to c the doctor to be sure of which option it is or wat is really happening.  Hope at least that gives u a little insight|`|qAWsuCtYaa	YES IT IS A BIG POSSIBILITY THAT U MAY BE PREGNANT..YOU SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR AND ASK THEM TO  DRAW YOUR BLOOD TO SEE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT...|`|kdZcHLETaa	Yes its possible that you are and it isn't showing up on the urine test. I know you said you didn't want to go to the doctor but hear me out... A lot of hospitals offer walk in blood tests and all you pay is the lab fee, no doctors, just a lab tech to draw your blood, you wait awhile (they have to centrifuge the blood for sereum), they test it and you get your results in like 45 minutes. I did this and it only cost $33 which was a lot cheaper than doing 15 home pregnancy tests and worth getting the stress of not knowing over!  Blood tests are much more sensitive for the hormone that signals pregnancy.  Its worth a try if you really just want to know, and it's relatively cheap!   Good luck
Qydtjz2naa	-You don't really like her  -You don't like her mother  -Your parents wouldn't like you to go  -You don't want to get drunk  -You're 13 years old    Those are the cons, I see no pros to going.  If you know you would feel uncomfortable going, don't go.  If you have to ask a question about going, you clearly know that it wont turn out well.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Your question is dumb.  You answered it yourself 5 times.    Don't go!|`|C5ZocttQaa	you r way to young to drink and if you think they will pressure you just don't go. don't lie to your parents because if they find out that you lied then everyone involved will be in trouble, her for having the party, you for lying, and your friends mother for allowing underage drinking. if you don't want to tell your friends why you cant go just tell them you were grounded|`|OGEC7RFwaa	well if you dont even really like her, then just dont go.|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	first of all someone that swears a lot and has tons of tattoos and piercings doesn't mean she's going to pressure you into anything, if you don't like her mother or her then why even go? it doesn't sound like the mom is pressuring you into going. it's the friends and do you really want friends that pressure you into stuff you really don't want to do 13 year olds shouldn't drink because it's against the law. don't drink. you can tell you parents how you feel about the party or what ever you want they are your parents. and not to be pressured keep saying no.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	This is peer-pressure you're experiencing.    Under no circumstances do you:  Go to this party.  Drink.    You tell your parents you're not going to this party if you do get an invite.     Don't do something just because all your friends will be going and drinking. That's not right.    Be the better person who doesn't get drunk at 13/14.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	You guys are very young and are easily pressured into doing things you don't want to you just don't know how to say no... I would not go. There's a good chance that another parent will find out about the drinking and will go to the cops with it.  And you being there, even if you didn't drink you will still get into a lot of trouble. I wouldn't go and I'd tell your parents that she is having a drinking party. It is VERY dangerous for young kids to drink.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Don`t go if you don`t want to drink. Drinking kills you.. If you go and they offer you any alcoholic beverage say no if this is really killing you don`t go. I don`t think you should go because that party might not be safe.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	I wouldn't go. Sounds like bad news.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	It sounds like you have already answered you own question.  The impression I get from your post is that you really do not feel like going or being pressured into going.  Be a leader and do what your gut is telling you is right.|`|Qojl2upQaa	dont go  if you dont tell your parrents that it is a drinking party and they find out later you will probably get into alot of trouble   cause they might think that u drank even if you didnt or did|`|Q412OM5gaa	Just don't go. It's not worth it. Going will just lead up to a bunch of other problems, like getting pressured into to doing things you don't want to, having your parents finding out people were drinking and getting in trouble, etc. Plus, what if all of your friends start drinking? If you  REALLY want to go then just go if your parents let you. But leave if you are being pressured to drink.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	Well dont go if you dont like her and dont care if your friends are going you dont have to be like them LOL|`|PExOJJLgaa	helloooooo.  this is illegal.  underage drinking.  i doubt any sane parent would let their kids go.  wtf.  you need to convince your friends that they are stupid and getting themselves into unnecessary sh!t if they go.  KEY WORD: ILLEGAL.|`|nYioXmnGaa	No you do not go , No do not drink, Tell them you do not want to go, and Do not go and you will not be pressured in to drinking|`|AA11308217	this party does not seem worth going to.  You do not need to drink.  Please dont feel pressured todo so....Im almost 19 and ive never even tried the stuff...its not worth it...ive seen to many of my friends/ family pass away from drinking too much.....    SOrry bout my rambling....i just dont want this to happen to you....Tell your parents about it....|`|G0Y8qcLzaa	Your love and respect for your parents should provide all the answers you need. Why would a first year (13)teenager want to engage in a lack-lustre booze up? I'd argue firmly, if you do go the hosts and every other legal age person in attendance, is responsible for you and any other under age (alcohol consumption) teen present. If any of you children consumed alcohol and the law descended on the premises, the adults risk being charged with aiding and abetting a child to consume alcohol.  Stay home and bone up on your studies. You'll be glad you did. Peace.
1ZWNmQ8Iaa	ur period but gurl  me too the other day i was like i want garlic bread and the next day i wanted oreos with bannas lol|`|RBxDWMjaaa	Hi,  Yeah it is because of your period!  I get like that ALL the time when I am on mine!    Lol... As long as you know you are not pregnant don't worry it, it's perfectly normal!    Hope I Helped!    Here are some sites that might help you out:  http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Book...    http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/cr...|`|fXQvr2oWaa	You answered your own question.    They're cravings. You get them randomly every once in awhile, or if you haven't had that food for awhile. :P|`|mvKbfkhGaa	When you crave certain things it usually means your body needs the nutrient in that food....like your body is lacking it. My sister was craving apples and i looked it up on google and i kept reading the same thing again and again.....Your body needs certain things once in awhile and it doesn't mean anythings wrong...it should pass in a couple of days! lol|`|JERUmEFzaa	Yah, It`s just because of your period. No worries Hun it`s completely normal.
PcjOgAacaa	I ovulated later with Clomid.  I normally ovulated around cd15 or 16, but with Clomid it was cd21 or cd22.    So, it's possible that clomid is delaying your ovulation as well.    I'm not sure why the doc wouldn't just tell you that over the phone though.  He may want to do an ultrasound to see if you have any follicles developing or ready to be released.    Good luck!
PcjOgAacaa	I would look at the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.  The previous answer is right, you need to be looking at your BBT's, to see when and if you are ovulating.   You could also use OPK's to see when you are ovulating to correctly time your BD.  The OPK box has paperwork inside which explains when to begin testing.    Good luck-- baby dust!|`|ihBFGugIaa	There is no way for us to tell you when you ovulate.  Do you chart your bbt?  That is what would tell you when you ovulate.
bQrXTUsxaa	hmmm, it seems as though your just a bit irregular. I would find the median of your cycle range and work from there. That way you won't put down too less or too long. Remember...to find the median what you have to do in your particular case is count the number of days between each of your cycles then add them all up (the numbers you get from counting the number of days between each of your cycles) and divide them by how many numbers are there. Try it and then use the number you got for on average how long your cycles last.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	I would average out your cycle length - remember you may not ovulate every month you have a period.
FLEXqVoiaa	I doubt he really meant to hurt you. He probably didn't think about what he said or how his words could effect you before he spoke.  Because of my PPD, I have said some awful things to my husband, and I never really meant any of them. Sometimes emotions just come out the wrong way. I bet if you talked to him tonight he would better explain what he meant.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh yeah make his *** get a vasectomy!!! Health insurance usually covers most of it, and if not, the procedure's only a few hundred dollars.|`|Xc02z608aa	You and your husband need couples counselling.  If he is throwing the word 'divorce' around, then clearly there are some other issues there, besides the child issue.  People don't throw that word around unless there are things that are bothering them.|`|kvHGjd1Raa	It's most likely a combination of the two.  Sometimes stress can turn anyone into a jerk.  I think it was very heartless for him to say that to you.  Maybe he should get a hysterectomy.  Things should get better as the baby gets older.  Good luck!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	He's really going to divorce you over a third child?  Wow.<br>  <br>  First, why are you using condoms?  The pill is more effective, or an IUD...<br>  <br>  Why doesn't he get a vasectomy if he's so adament about not having anymore children?  <br>  <br>  Funny thing about divorce, it doesn't free you from your children, only your spouse.  He will still be financially responsible for the children and if he's any kind of father at all, he still still have to be a father to them.<br>  <br>  Is counseling an option?  If it is, I would drag him along.  If he won't go, go alone.<br>  <br>  I'm as baffled as you...|`|4SDqRs6Laa	Oh wow... Sorry to hear that...<br>  <br>  You two really need a serious heart to heart talk. I agree, there is definitely more going on with him if he threatens you with divorce for an accidental pregnancy. Even if it turns out you're not pregnant, this is alarming. I don't know how the lines of communication are between you two, but there's something missing and as his wife you have the right to know. Don't force him to tell you though. Give him lots of room. Most men don't pour their hearts out when they feel pressured. He needs to feel he can fully trust you. Then hopefully you will get the answers you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep us posted.|`|KEoChTcdaa	Oh...Wow...just...wow. <br>  <br>  If he is going to divorce you because you have children then you probably shouldn't have gotten married in the first place. Sex and children are a part of marriage and accidents happen. If I accidentally got pregnant right now, no my husband wouldn't be thrilled, but he wouldn't cut himself off from the child and he certainly wouldn't threaten me with divorce.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should see a counselor...That is all I have to offer, and I am so sorry for your situation.|`|AORcLwTNaa	you need to talk to him seriousley|`|XOtOMncwaa	It sounds to me like you need to re-evaluate your relationship. I think he IS stressed out, but I also think he's a bit of a jerk. If I were to get pregnant today my fiance would be ecstatic, and if I were to get pregnant 5 more times he would also be just as happy. I know kids are stressful, but he doesn't need to take it to the limit of divorce. It takes 2 people to make a baby so why is is ONLY your fault if you get pregnant? Maybe try some counseling, or a long sit down conversation, he sounds like he needs to be put into his place. And honestly if my fiance had said that he would divorce me if I got pregnant again I think I would have honestly told him that we should go ahead and start the process because if he would do that to me then he's not someone I need to be with. I don't know your husband and he might be a great person other than the children thing, but honestly is that something you want to put up with? Go get some good birth control, and talk to him about how you feel, it's just not right for him to threaten you like that!
Wd7ujHNhaa	It looks like you could be pregnant!!!  I had these same symptoms about a week before AF was due and was pregnant.  I suggest...wait a week after AF is due to take a pregnancy test though.  This will give your body enough time to build up hcg (it doubles every 2 to 3 days).  Most hpts don't detect the amount of hcg they say they can even if they are the early pregnancy tests.  If you test earlier, you have a good chance of getting a false negative, and you would be stuck in limbo not knowing for sure anyway.  I hope this helps!!!  Sending lots of luck and Baby Dust!!!|`|ihBFGugIaa	you could be feeling implantation. That feels like light period cramping to those that feel their implantation.  Not everyone does, but many do.  Pregnancies are different for everyone, and right about now seems that based on what you are telling us, that it is about the time implantation would be happening.  I am referring to the cramping anyway. Some woman also say that they know they are pregnant from the moment it happens.|`|Mai98KQLaa	It is generally too early for all these symptoms. Sometimes wanting it soo bad makes all the symptoms amplified like times 20. I know - have been there myself.    Good luck to you.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	just wait for 2-3 days and take a home pregnancy test. Best wishes|`|HomvXYt4aa	I'm going through almost the exact same thing...the veiny boobs, the peeing constantly, not to mention the huge areolas and the mood swings (some times i hate to be around myself lol) just letting you know your not alone and I'm sick of waiting to take a test as well!! TTC is so stressful when you just want to know asap if its worked!!  GOOD LUCK AND MY FINGERS ARE CROSSED FOR U!!
C5pVfdzwaa	I vote for Rebecca Grace Smith|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Adorable! Love most of them!|`|SqCgWGCqaa	Alright, been there done that.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	okay i did..|`|AA12221392	I voted. I like leigh rose.. That was my favorite, It is not real common but not real freaky either.     And it kinda fits with the other names well.
52bAHCaUaa	I don't believe a glass of wine will lead to more. Perhaps some people can take it to far, but that doesn't mean every woman will become an alcoholic for having a glass of wine.    I believe anything in moderation is fine. :) Congrats!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	my doctor told me a glass or two wouldnt hurt me.  It is the women who go out and get completely trashed that makes it a problem.  My doctor said some women have their "night time" glass of wine even whilst pregnant.  I am in a wedding on the weekend, and ive been saving myself for a glass then lol. Doctor has ok'd it- said it was fine, provided i dont get drunk|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	i've heard some women would have a small glass just to keep their blood thin during pregnancy,but i didn't have any.cause alcohol has a bad effect on the baby's brain.|`|CfFntr5Haa	it might be, but I wouldn't take any chances on the baby... you dont want anything to happen to your little munchkin would you?|`|TN3Sthbwaa	It is obviously your choice but just remember that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the ONLY 100% preventable developmental disability.  The only person responsible for a child born with with FAS is that childs mother.  There are no studies that conclusively say how much alcohol is safe in pregnancy.  Seeing as each persons body is different and each persons bodies reacts differently to the same things it goes to reason that while one glass of red wine every once in awhile is ok for some women and their babies, it may be the thing that pushes someone elses babies development towards FAS.  i wouldn;t want that guilt on my shoulders.    Is 9 months really that long to abstain?|`|ob7jTC5Caa	Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this and I'll probably get all thumb's down just for saying that.  They can't and never will do a study to see the effects small amounts of alcohol have on a fetus because no mother will subject their child to that. All they've been able to confirm is what happens with mothers who drink an outrageous amount.  People in other parts of the world drink wine weekly and nightly while pregnant.  I've had about 3 glasses my entire pregnancy. Small glasses.  Ultimately it's up to you and what you feel is right.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	What you put into your body, you're putting into your baby's body. Resist the temptation.|`|1dVrFHctaa	I don't think a small amount of wine will hurt, but if you have a small amount regularly that could be a problem. Best off avoiding it all together, substitute it with something else. I know it sounds stupid but maybe drink grape juice out of a wine glass and pretend it's wine. I love cider so i drink carbonated apple juice and pretend it's cider...  You don't want to do anything to affect your baby.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i dont know but its such a little thing to give up so why would you still do it? smoking 1 cigarette a day probably wouldnt hurt either but its just better to quit and you wont have to worry|`|iMULlxdgaa	its ok,  just don't go over board a small glass is that..a small glass then put the bottle down.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Look I am not saying that it is good to smoke while pregnant but I know a lot of women who just cut back on their smoking and some who still smoked like normal and their kids came out perfectly happy. One cigarette a day is good and you still have time to quit. I dont think you have much to worry about since you are trying.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Ok it probably won't do anything..I have a friend who did this and her baby was fine...however if you o over board your baby will definatley not be fine. I have known of a woman who smoked like she wasn't prego and her kids all had heart problems and such.  I would just try and stay away from situations that will make you smoke,  find a hobby,  and try to make it a rule to not smoke like at least every other day until you cna just quit for good.  At least your only smoking like 1 a day.  Keep it like that if you HAVE to...but I would strongly suggest just quiting  ASAP.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    it is harmful to baby. first 12 weeks are the most important.  Remember slowly quitting is better to not quitting at all.  so good on you.    if you feel stressed and need one. crave one. have one. only when needed.   because then its stress on your body and baby if you dont have it.  Take it slow and ease off when you feel less craving it.    God Bless x|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Come on now.  What do you expect people to say to this?  You're adult enough to get pregnant, now deal with the fact that you no longer come first.  You NEED TO QUIT.  I don't care how much you "need" it.  You and your baby don't need this.  It can put both of you in extreme danger.  If you want to die of lung cancer, go ahead.  Your innocent baby did not ask for it.  Quit right now.|`|3Ncriah6aa	there are many problems they have associated with smoking and pregnancy. the only one i know of that is proven fact is low birth wieght. it doesnt sound bad but it can cause a lot of problems for the baby. i smoke and am in early pregnacy as well my doctor told me to do anything i can to quit because im having a difficult time. if you can quit before the end of your 1st trimester theres a 61% chance i believe it is that your baby will be as healthy as a non smokers baby. hope i help a little. make sure and talk to your doc. when you have an appt. til then you can find facts and stats if you search google|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	My sister in law has always been a heavy smoker and she's had 2 kids and a third on the way.  She always cuts bad during pregnancy usually she has half to a whole cig a day or on a good day, none.  She knows its bad for the baby and my dad rags on her alot but he doesn't understand because he's never had that "problem" and my mothers a nurse and says it's better than puffing a carton a day or quitting cold turkey and have withdrawls while pregnant.    I've had a few puffs [literally I found out I'm allergic to cigs this way] in high school but obviously that doesn't mean I get to have an opinion.  But I do understand how she feels.  I'm totally jinxed - medically and otherwise.. I'm allergic to alcohol, cigs, some mediciations, some food addetives. Blah.    But her children have come out fine other than some bizzare health issues that a most likely unrelated [Mystery allergy that causes my nephew to go into anephalatic shock.. they say it could be peanuts but we feel otherwise.. and if he gets an ear infection its a sign of an allergic reaction to something =/]    Edit: My neice and nephew were estimated to be about 8-10 pounds during their final ultra sound before delivery but due to retarded doctors beliveing she wasn't in labour.. my neice nearly died [over a month due in the womb she was dying and the fluids were being tainted with her wastes] and my nephew was actually over too.  My sister actually began labour july 27 at midnight which was my birthday.. we went to the hospital and the doc sent her home.. August 25 my nephew was born 6 lbs.  My neice was suppose to be end of jan.. she was march 15 and 5 lbs.|`|WdGI3QoOaa	Just quit.  It is bad for the baby now and it will be bad for the child later...sorry I know it is not what you want to hear, but just quit!|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	You should stop NOW all together. Before I got pregnant I was smoking like 3 to 4 a day. But the day I found out I was pregnant I totally stopped. Now that I haven't smoked for 9 months I think smoking is disgusting. It was all for the better. I am SO proud of myself.|`|cmegTuVNaa	My sister had smoked about that much with her two pregnancies and her babies are healthy, and were both 7+ pounds when they were born. It is a risk and I wouldn't recommend it but I'm sure the baby will be okay. Congratulations btw!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	My Doc said that it's better to have that one cigarette than to become overwhelmed  - the stress is more harmful at this time than the cigarette (the fetus is not completely dependent on the placenta yet). You will be able to quit - keep up the good work and congratulations!!|`|LiPoEBenaa	If you are trying to quit you'll be okay as long as you achieve it. Smoking during pregnancy isn't a good idea. It can be a factor in pre-eclampsia in later pregnancy which can make you deliver prematurely. Plus whatever you inhale is directed to your blood stream, that goes to the placenta, through the umbilical cord, and to the baby. Good luck on your pregnancy and I hope you find the strength to quit!    EDIT: just because your husbands side of the family has large babies doesn't mean you will. My husband was 10lb 2 oz and his sister was almost as large. I'm 36wks and my baby is measring a tad small 5lb 4 oz and I'm a non smoker and perfectly healthy!|`|qImMwhUHaa	I know it causes low birth weight other than that I don't know that anything has been proven but you know it's not good. All the chemicals and the nicotine can only cause harm. That's good for you that you're trying to quit, I know it's hard but you have a really good motivation now that you are pregnant.
ttrA4TiRaa	it could be that your level are still out of wack, because i know when i had my miscarriage mine where like that for almost one month. but we for the strong craivings only you would be able to know. I really dont know what i would think if this was happening to me. I think the best thing would be to wait it out and see if you get your cycle at the begining of march, if not then i would go see my ob/gyn and let them know so that you can get an ultrasound to make sure|`|HTSLBPE2aa	sounds like you might be preg. you should get checked to make sure if you are or aren't. good luck!|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i want some lemonade and some hamburger helper with a popcicle.|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	Don't worry about the lemon cravings. I craved lemons like there was no tomorrow with my daughter. If you are pregnant then it is meant to be. Just try to relax and not stress out. I hope everythign goes well for you and gl!
jiwTWNNtaa	I hear you. Pregnancy boobs were great, nursing boobs were great, after that, well it was a little bit of a let-down.    I went back to my pre-pregnancy weight and then after I gained back 10 pounds, I thought they looked better. (I'm short and small).     I wouldn't risk surgery because I have too many people who depend on me. I don't like the look of implants naked. They look great under clothes, but I can almost do that with bras. I'd hate to risk losing any breast or nipple sensation because my breasts are so much more sensitive and react when I'm turned on. It's like a newly discovered reward.    In the end, it all boils down to how important it is to you. You make a list of pros and cons next to each other and compare them. Don't forget to do it when you are in a good mood with good self esteem. Not in a feel bad mood.    To me, not a biggie. To most guys, they like boobs. Boobs are great, why fix a great thing?|`|XXo0uHcbaa	Do what you want to do. I think NATURAL perky breasts look better as well, but are they really that perky anymore?|`|NrJs8en2aa	No, stay natural, hun. Natural always looks best. I hate fake boobs. Love your body and cherish it as it is. So-called "flaws" like saggingness and stretchmarks and other things people talk about as negative are what turn a lot of guys on (the mature ones). Natural is the way to go! :-)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	implants look like viking cartoon charactor breasts  I breastfed 18 yrs and I took care of my breasts  sports bra 24/7  they are not damaged at all  Quite bodacious if you ask the crowd|`|C5ZocttQaa	i think that natural is better without the implants, instead i would consider a breast lift. they're more natural besides plastic surgery only lasts seven years, that plus if an implant leaks or bursts your in big trouble could be fatal|`|PlmT4lHXaa	IMPLANTS. im not even a mom, and im still getting implants because big perky boobs are much better than small ones.|`|kbdkOPHDaa	LOL i also have 2 kids and there is NO WAY i can afford to get a boob job....i think i would be too nervous to actually go through with it anyways...   if i was gonna do anything surgical from my kids, it would be a tummy tuck, LOL.    yeah kids ruined my body but they are worth it.  i think natural look best like you said but mine arent too bad after kids.|`|E9vjv9pBaa	Oh man- I was just speaking about this last night.  You really have to think about this one clearly.  Most guys love a great set of breasts but then again MOST guys could care less if they are perfect.    I considered having my breasts done (after much research of course) and then I started looking the horror stories and really thought about it.  Do I really want to take the chance of adding my "horror story"?  Also I have looked at plenty celebrities and wondered about their decisions.  They have plenty of money and still have jacked up boob jobs.  Another thing - any type of cosmetic surgery requires upkeep.  Are you prepared to do this again every 10 years?    Either way - make sure you really think it through and if you decide to get some -- DO YOUR RESEARCH on the best doctor possible.

It took me a while to gain with my first pregnancy, but then I started gaining and they told me to slow down.

y3HLL203aa	It's great that you have such a bond with your sisters and I'm sure that they would love to hear about how you are feeling!  They would probably much rather you tell them about it and express your feelings to them then to find out that you are feeling so sad and alone all by yourself.  You never want to bottle such feelings up because it will only get worse, especially if you are already leaving classes and such because you can't bear the way that you are feeling.  Talk to your sisters and your parents about what you are going through and if you don't feel comfortable talking to them about it go to your guidance counselor at school and vent your feelings to them.  Either way, it is better to get it out than to hold it in, you may get some great advice and support from them, after all that's what you have done for them right.  Hope your feeling better soon!!|`|uKg7ye4waa	email me, we can talk more. |`|eRq63z5Saa	Why are you so sad?|`|H6w3ACkFaa	I know how you feel i wish i could help but i have the same problem and i hate the idea of opening up to people so i cover it till i am alone  but one thing what has really help me is when i feel bad i write it in a note book i know but it really helps me i some times i write letters to people telling them but don't give it to them  i hope you feel better   remember your not alone

Its hard to tell because you haven't missed a period yet which is when your temp would drop.  18 consecutive days of high temps is a great sign. At this point, you have to wait and see if you get your period.|`|PcjOgAacaa	It's too soon to tell with your temps, BUT your spotting on dpo9 and dpo10 look good.

54fa0a35bd00b66807cdebfb50bf67ceaa	You have multiple issues, but most will probably improve after the delivery. It is possible that your hand symptoms may be explained by carpal tunnel syndrome. See the link below.|`|RizlnGVYaa	Hiya, <br>  i had carpal tunnel when i was pregnant with my daughter and it was like pins and needles or my hand would go numb which would only go away when i moved my hand into different positions. it even woke me up through the night.<br>  after i had my daughter it did go away.<br>  i never done anything to prevent it but i think you can get a splint to keep your hand in a position to stop it from happening.<br>  not sure if its what youve got but i thought id let you know =]<br>  xxx|`|FA1rRzUxaa	it sounds like carpal tunnel syndrome.

oIFMohfUaa	You didn't say how old your baby is...but I'm guessing very young.  I don't see this answer here, so I'll give you my best answers and advice...    Babies have a natural, and very strong, sucking desire...and it not only soothes him, but also builds your milk supply.  When he is suckling,   but not really nursing, he is still getting drops of milk...he's bringing down your "hind" milk...the milk up high in your breasts...even up into the underarm area.  This stimulates more milk...you are never empty.  He gets his fatty milk that way and insures that your body makes more.      When he's going through growth spurts, he'll suckle even more!  We used to joke that the kids were "velcroed" to my breast...they even made the slurping/velcro noise when removed!    He also satisfies his sucking desire.      When he is in your arms, he feels totally secure...you smell good to him, you are at perfect distance for him to see your face...so he studies you...makes mental photos, ingrained memories. Have you ever remembered something from your childhood when you smell or taste something? That's what he's doing.  In the wild, an animal can die if they don't know their mother's scent and sight.     Your body also "fine tunes" to his needs...by HIS smell and body odor (that you can't even smell!) Then your milk makes exactly what he needs...no two breastfed babies get the exact same mixture!  Like a fingerprint.     If he is hurting your nipples, he's letting go a little and needs to be re-adjusted as he is not latching on correctly!  He starts out correct, then as he satisfies, he is slipping off and sucking only on the nipple and not on the areola AND the nipple!  It will cause pain and soreness!  Slide your finger in the corner of his mouth and break the suction and re-start the latch on!When they have a pacifier it soothes the sucking desire until it is no longer a desire, but hunger.  Don't get me wrong, 3 of my 5 kids had pacifiers!  I HAD to take a break...potty, shower, sleep...you get the picture!  All of them were very healthy...besides, they'll let you know when it's not good enough!      If he's under a month old, I wouldn't use a pacifier for a couple of weeks, maybe even a month...as all the stimulation and milk is needed to gain those healthy pounds!    I hope this helps!  (Don't we all wish we could breastfeed and drive!  Life would be grand...)    Good luck!|`|60FCA8dVaa	It's comforting to him. I'd rather that let him than listen to all that crying.|`|TajdONO7aa	pacifiers are artificial nipples, makes you wonder why they would invent such a thing if it wasn't natural for a baby to want to use mom for this. just put up with it, it really wont last all that long in the whole grand scheme of things- enjoy nursing, its a blessing. also, try to change your attitude|`|BbMZySeEaa	I don't breastfeed but I saw a question exactly like this a couple days ago and a lot of people were saying that was normal and they will eventually stop. For a while my baby loved my fingers and hated the pacifier and I have no idea why.|`|ocNUYENRaa	I've been there. If it were legal and not extremely perilous I would nurse my 3 month old while driving! Breast beats all for comforting. Your arms are safe and snuggly! Your breast is much better than a some piece of cold rubbery weird thing (in his eyes). My son won't take a paci.     Can you try holding to your chest and just gazing at him for awhile. Sometimes I do this with my son. We coo back and forth and it seems to ease him. I find he gets fussier and wants this contact more when I've been busy. I usually take a step back and spend sometime with him. He's only a baby for so long. The house can wait is my mentality.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	I don't know why babies do it...but my daughter does it, too...and my son did it forEVER!  I guess you either have to give him a real paci or me happy that you are comforting to him.    Edit:  You are very correct when you say we aren't SUPPOSED to do it.  It can lead to mastitis.  I don't know if you have ever gone through it, but it was worse than la bor for me!  Again, I would try a paci.  I alternate between Gerber's Natural Flex (bends the way a nipple would bend...as much as silicon can, right?!) and  Playtex Binky Most Like Mother (again, in silicon).|`|WChZRrcBaa	Are you saying that he just suckles on your breast but isn't feeding? So he just sucks?   If this is what you're saying, I would suggest getting a NUK brand pacifier. They are designed to be the shape of mom's nipple to make it easier for the baby to transition back and forth. Good luck.|`|as2c3qCIaa	He does because he likes too and thus far you have let him.  I am with you though and it just isn't practical and it hurts.  My daughter tried this as well, what I did was I dipped her paci in to some gripe water (which will not hurt her/him), she loved the taste and would then suck on her pacifier for a while.  At first you might have to dip it quite a few times until he gets used to sucking on it but it should eventually work.  Good luck and please don't feel guilty about not wanting to have to feel like having your baby attached to you at all times.  You love him and you ARE a good mom just for asking the question!
zcYl3ftTaa	As 'Do Your Own Thinking' said, if you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to nurse.    You can try to feed her the bottle against your bare skin. Soothe her first.  Don't drink anything for the next hour except water, and you may be fine to nurse her at bedtime.  You have done nothing wrong. My wife occasionally takes a night for herself, and you certainly are prepared.|`|oIFMohfUaa	Maybe she just wants mommy.  Have daddy put one of your pj's (or something with your scent on it, pillowcase, t-shirt you've worn, etc.) over his chest and maybe she'll feel better with your scent on it!    The ingredients in the beer have always been said to make rich breastmilk...just not the alcohol.    Good luck...|`|3X0Lsk5caa	Just keep trying the bottle. If she's hungry, she will take it eventually. Don't nurse her after you've been drinking. It's so hard, you wait 9 months to be able to cut loose and have fun for one night, but when you breastfeed you still have so much to worry about! Just keep trying, and for future reference, ask her pediatrician what to do in situations like this. Good luck!|`|baI5G8yLaa	Huh she would normally take a bottle? not sure wat the problem is then why dont you give her the bottle maybe its just mummy who she wants just as long as your not wasted and smoking at them same time!    How many you had? if its 1 then ya fine to breast feed anymore than wait until after MIN 4 hrs after the last drink i personally always wait 8 hrs always better to be safe than sorry|`|P7VdWn7baa	know what you mean it s probley the nipple! I went a bought a NUK nipple and he took it I was so scared because I had already drank, but that nipple was the only one he would take so try that! GL oh and alchole does not stay in your system very long look at my question I ask on the same thing you asked. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You need to wait at least 90 minutes per drink (kellymom.com).  If you've been smoking change your clothes, wash your hands, brush your teeth and try to give her the bottle. Sometimes my daughter will take the bottle better from me than my husband.|`|68c6B8dRaa	How much have you had to drink? If you are sober enough to drive, nurse away.|`|Ud871v3paa	It depends on how much you had to drink, you dont' have to pump and dump or anything as long as your aren't DRUNK.  I think its like 1 drink per hour since you've been drinking or under the legal limit to drive...sober enough to drive, sober enough to breastfeed.   Smoking is a different story, most mothers who smoke don't set aside a time to smoke to clear from their milk, they usually smoke while breastfeeding so I am sure you're fine.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	There is nothing you can do?? you're joking right...your baby wants you possibly to nurse & all you can think about is filling your body with smoke & beer
AA10624857	I would suggest that you not worry so much about this. Becoming an older sibling affects every child differently. Some embrace the idea with gusto barely containing their excitement while others simply don't want to talk about having another baby come live with them. At only 1 1/2 years old, your son is still a baby himself. His thinking and understanding are still very much in the literal phase. He knows what a baby is, but he can't see the one in your tummy. He understands that there are babies, but there isn't one at his house, so it makes perfect sense to him to think that whatever baby you are planning on bringing into the house is going somewhere else eventually. He has no experience yet with a baby coming and staying. I'd refrain from arguing as much as possible. If his nightly routine is to ask you who is getting the baby, keep telling him that the baby will be a part of your family, but if he says "No", just let that go. When the baby does come to stay you may find he is perfectly accepting of the idea and becomes an immediate fierce protector of the baby, but he is just as likely to beg you to send it right back where it came from. Our third baby was born when our older 2 were 5 1/2 and 3 years 2 months old. We thought we'd done a pretty good job of preparing them for the added family member. When they came to visit at the hospital, we counted fingers and toes and worked out the initial worry over her appearance. Her birth was a traumatic one with the cord wrapped around her neck as well as born in an odd posterior position that necessitated forceps aid so she was bruised and cut, but fine. Our oldest had her turn at holding the new baby sister then it was our son's turn. He jumped up next to me and held out his little arms to hold her. As I put her in him arms, he looked up at me and said, "Who is this, mom?" We nearly died laughing, it was so funny. We thought he had understood it all, but he really had no clue that the baby we talked about in mommy's tummy was going to actually come out. Even after we brought the baby home, he'd still pat my tummy and say, "Hi, baby". I wouldn't try to fix anything because nothing really is broken. Your son is behaving very age appropriately. Just speak positively about the new baby and him being a big brother, but don't push it and don't worry if it doesn't go too well at first.  He isn't jealous, not yet anyway, but he probably will be when he sees you holding the baby.  There is no need to resort to punishing your son, he just is so little yet that he doesn't understand the concept of a baby sibling joining your family.  Patience, encouragement, and understanding will get your through this.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	just keep telling him you are keeping it and hes just probably senative and doesnt know what to do. go to a doctor if you are THAT worried about it|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	He is jealous, only you can put a stop to it. Don't be nice, quit kissing his *** about it. Say: Dad and Mom loved eachother so much we wanted children you were the 1st born, we are good to you and we love and protect you. Now we are going to have our 2nd baby. We are going to love, and protect our new baby. We will love you the same. The first year a baby is born, that baby will need some more of my time, cause the baby can't eat, or go to the bathroom yet. As I did for you, I will do for this new baby. You will be nice to this baby and my stomach now or get a bum spank very hard, so that you know I will not tolerate this bad behavior. Know that I love you, and this baby. But you will not mistreat this baby in any way. Then don't leave him alone with baby until baby can talk well and tell you what is going on.|`|z55wuVRjaa	He's not even two.  Give him a break.  He still thinks that things can be given or taken away, no matter what they are.  That's exactly what you've been teaching him so far with all those presents, going to or away from school/stores/houses, etc etc.  Things have been "come here, go away".  Now he's applying the same principle to the baby, and thinks the baby can go away.  You need to give him and teach him a sense of permanency, because he obviously has none.  My daughter's two, and she knows it well already.|`|t0mb150gaa	Just let your son know that this baby is going to be a part of your family but he is probably feeling a bit threatened right now so reassure him that you will still love him as much as you do now and that his place in the family is not going to change. Try to make it exciting for him about being an older brother and how the baby is going to need him to learn things and look up to.|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	buy brother or sister books for him instead of telling him its a baby tell him its His baby brother or sister and when he accepts that it is a member of the family instead of just a baby then ask him if he is excited about having a baby brother or sister and talk about their relationship from his point of view and get him pumped up about it...
xOr67VDiaa	My kids love the idea they are having another brother, cos ive always made sure i told them the baby was for them too, with my 6 year old i tell her you have to help feed him, keep him safe and make sure no one touches him lol, and she is just over the moon and its all about her and the baby, my 4 year old boy, is so excited because its a boy like him, he just keeps saying, when is my boy coming, boy like me and dad..and my 2 year old daughter doesnt really get it yet, but when we talk about the baby she starts to say new baby coming new one, aww baby lol you just need to keep reminding him its his baby too, when he asks, who are we giving it too, so its your baby and you have to love him and keep him/her. and get him really excited about small things like going to the shops to buy something for the baby, and buy your son something and this is for you and this is for our baby.. small things like that help, i dont mean spoil him, i mean make him as excited as you are and believe me its easier than it sounds..|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I think you are doing the right thing by telling him that you are keeping the baby.  Maybe you could say it is mommy's baby too?  I think it's awesome that he is talking that well ( I too have a two year old boy)!  I also have a 3 month old girl.  I tell him it is mommy's baby and Ethan's baby sister.  I repeated it over and over after we had her.  Now he just calls her baby.|`|rAeJ74Neaa	i know what you mean i was the same as well, at that age they may feel jelous and feel like they wont crave the attention they want once the baby is born, it best to keep going as you are by telling him that the baby is going to be apart of the family and that he is going to be a big brother saying things to him like . Are you going to look after the baby with mummy and daddy? it gives him that sense of responsiblity even if he is nearly 2. But u must make sure he knows that the baby is not going anywhere once he/she is born and that they are part of the family :) x

Luckily, she's got a scholarship to cover the rest!  <br>  <br>  Any loans that she does end up with will most likely be in her name, but, if she wants help when it's time to pay them back, I'm sure we'll do what we can to help her out (maybe in the form of free room & board, etc, until she gets on her feet).  <br>  <br>  Her guidance counselor is also calling her down to his office, from time to time, offering her more scholarship & grant opportunities that he thinks she'll qualify for.  <br>  <br>  Call the guidance counselor, introduce yourself, ask for help!|`|H2IqzG12aa	Financial aid, scholarships, student loans, part-time jobs, etc.  The school's own financial aid office can advise you.  Also, the costs vary greatly from college to college, from community college to private college to state university, from commuting to living on campus, etc.  Shop around.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i'm not a parent but i am a second year returning student<br>  there are several things that can help<br>  one you will commonly be asked to fill is a fafsa student loan if you qualify<br>  they also offer scholarships,  at my college i believe i got one just for having a 3.0 average<br>  there are many sites willing to help you with tuition that they will either right off the bat suggest or you can find on your specific college<br>  usually the parents will pay but some students choose to work there own way<br>  and in state schools sometimes are cheaper|`|0iOqIbfNaa	Fill out fafsa application for scholarships on fafsa.gov   and if your children fills out for scholarships then they will be the one paying them back...just make sure the loans are subsidized so they wont have to start paying back til they graduate. also there is no interest on those loans until 6 months after the child graduate.  my advise...get as many grants as you can, you dont have to pay them back and there are no penalties if something turns up|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	This site covers the various financial aid options:  <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/what010.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/what010.htm</a><br>  <br>  I did four years at a small university using only scholarships, grants, and my federal student loans (which the student pays back after graduation....STILL paying mind back.)  My parents chose to help me pay for housing, books, and other living costs during that time.  That is what worked for my family based on their income and because I have younger siblings.<br>  <br>  The best option may differ for you, BUT I will highly recommend you encourage your children to seek out any and all scholarships.  I was reluctant (typical teen,) but so very glad my mom stayed on me about applying for them....they help a lot!|`|hVVALFAPaa	Fill out the FAFSA form (available online or through the high school counselor) Hurry, though, the deadline is SOON!<br>  <br>  They will help you find scholarships (you don't have to repay), grants (you don't have to repay) and loans (you do repay but don't have to start payments until after graduation and at a very low interest rate which can be waived if your child goes into certain 'needy' areas -- teaching is one)<br>  <br>  Most of the loans are repaid by the child but parents can help.<br>  <br>  The more financial burdens you have, the more likely you are to get aid-- make sure you list the medical expenses and the fact that your daughter is one of 4 kids.<br>  <br>  When applying for colleges, make sure your daughter looks into the costs of each one. Many state colleges are much cheaper than private colleges. She could also start at a community college, live at home for a year while taking the basic 'starter' classes, then transfer into a larger 4 year college.|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	Pell grant, student loans there are two types and the student pays back after they graduate, have your child go to the financial aide office at the college she will attend and you go with her they will help with all of this|`|7uVlYPEIaa	Been through college. If your child needs loans to attend school then it is their loan, and typically the parent is the co-signer. The student then pays the loan back after they get out of school. Even then they can defer the loan till they get a job that can actually pay the loan, the interest does start to accumulate after they are out of school for 6 months.Make sure to apply for financial aid and most high schools have a counselor that specializes in this. I know my high school guidance counselor helped my parents out a lot with it with my sister, and by the time they got to my  little sister they were pretty much pros themselves. My parents never made enough to pay for us to go to school, and with my father being sick pretty much my whole youth their credit was a mess. So they would co-sign like the school loans wanted, then when they got denyed it actually helped us to get more grants and different loans. The tips I was always told was to remove any money from the students bank account prior to applying so that it is not counted against them. <br>  <br>  Also, our local community college offers post secondary which is a good way to get the basic classes for free and out of the way before they go to college, while in high school, instead of taking high school courses. Ours even lets them attend in the summers for free while in high school and the summer after graduation for free. Some kids that aren't doing so well in regular high school actually do better taking the college classes because of the class set up.
BKr3y30maa	From my personal experience, you can easily last until Valentine's Day.  People are dilated 1 cm for weeks and still don't go into labor. That's what happened with me! Congrats and best wishes for a smooth and safe delivery!|`|iMULlxdgaa	probably not much over your due date.  you seem to be right on track!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I would guess within the next week. Your body seems like it is starting to prepare so it shouldnt be much longer. I dont think you will make it to valentines day. Good luck and congratulations.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	maybe like 5 days to a week
iMULlxdgaa	I wondering the same I'm 37 weeks and just don't knwo how much more left...I'll be watching your responses.|`|ROJans2Taa	I started getting strong pressure around 34 weeks I delivered at 39 weeks after having my membranes stripped. I also was experiencing, strong, painful braxton hicks from 32 weeks
68c6B8dRaa	"or is it more complicated?"    Yeah, I'd read up a bit first.      "Instead of letting infants cry, American parents should keep their babies close, console them when they cry, and bring them to bed with them, where they'll feel safe, according to Michael L. Commons and Patrice M. Miller, researchers at the Medical School's Department of Psychiatry.    The pair examined childrearing practices here and in other cultures and say the widespread American practice of putting babies in separate beds -- even separate rooms -- and not responding quickly to their cries may lead to incidents of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders when these children reach adulthood.    The early stress resulting from separation causes changes in infant brains that makes future adults more susceptible to stress in their lives, say Commons and Miller.    "Parents should recognize that having their babies cry unnecessarily harms the baby permanently," Commons said. "It changes the nervous system so they're overly sensitive to future trauma.""    http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/...    It's not a research-backed "method," it's just some bollocks written up so an asshole could sell books to lazy mothers. There is nothing to support the idea that it's okay for the babies. See http://talaris.org/pdf/research/CIOPoste...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I would recommend reading the whole book.  There is a lot more to it than that.  I also think it depends a great deal on the temperament of your baby and your own disposition.    Personally speaking, I never had to let my son cry for longer than ten minutes, and even that was only a few times.  I suspect if he was more of a crier, I would not have been able to do it.    In terms of when you can start, I think it's vital that you start after your baby is able to communicate his needs in a greater variety of ways than simply one loud cry.  My son has a variety of cries, there is one in particular that will wake me from the deepest sleep and have me in his room in seconds.    Some people recommend that you somehow shut out the crying when it happens, but I personally disagree.  I think you need to listen the whole time, constantly evaluating the situation.  I also think you need to listen because if you are not able to listen to your baby cry, you can't do it.  It's fine if you can't do it, and a lot of parents refuse to, but I do think that if you are going to do it you have to stay mindful of the fact that your baby is crying.  You can't just turn on the TV and forget about it.    It's also important to try make sure that your child is getting enough naps.  Tossing an overtired baby into a crib and letting him cry will not make him sleep, no matter how frequently you go in.  It's not a magic bullet for sleep problems and you will still be getting up to tend to your baby on a regular basis.    I could write many paragraphs on this, but it's a delicate subject and I know a lot of people disagree with me.    I'd recommend checking out "Healthy Sleep Habit, Happy Child" before I read Ferber.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	I would recommend "never."     Every time I've cried myself to sleep, it's because I was in emotional agony. And then the sleeping itself was far from restful. I'm sure it's been the same for you. Do you really think it's wise to put an infant of any age through that?    I get the best sleep when I am comfortable, happy, and feeling safe. You can give that to your baby instead of making him/her sob until s/he is so exhausted, s/he falls asleep.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	We practice Attachment Parenting in our house...  to include babywearing and co-sleeping.  There is no real crying it out.  It could possibly lead to feelings of insecurities and abandonment.    Studies show that children who are attended to more often grow up more bonded and eventually more independent.    Good luck.  Please read the No-Cry Sleep Solution.  It isn't necessarily what I have explained here...so don't be put off by that.  I am acutely aware our way is not the way for everyone.  However, it is definitely not the cry-it-out method, either.  This has been recommended to me by a professional...as well as to many of my friends..and has worked for all!|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	I'm absolutely in agreement with Do your own thinking!. I'll only add that I've never had the heart to let my children 'cry it out'.    I go by two premises, the first is that a child cries because there is a problem, the second is that babies are developmentally incapable of manipulation. If he is crying, there is a problem or a need - and even if that need is only for a little snuggle, then I will fill that need.    I say it again, I could never stand by and watch and hear my baby cry. How awful for him and for me.|`|ocNUYENRaa	I agree with everyone else. Don't use the CIO method. Ever.     Do You Own Thinking - Thanks for the laugh!
iMaTMWMxaa	I don't think so. They recommend that a baby doesw not use a bottle after 1 year old, so why not start now.<br>  <br>  If your child takes to it, then great. Worth a try :)|`|7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	Definitely not too early.  All of mine started with sippy cups at 7 months old.  After a couple of months of practice at it, they got all of their liquids with one.  If your baby is up for it--go for it.  The sooner he/she learns it, the easier it will be for the bottle to go away completely.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Nope, if the baby can do it and likes it then there is no reason not to switch.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Currently I do not know what a nuby cup is, but starting on a cup and solid food is good idea.  Do it gradually.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Of course you can give a cup at 9 months, my daughter isn't even 8 months yet and takes it just fine|`|Xc02z608aa	I give my son his water in a nuby cup.  When he has mastered that I plan to bottle break him.  "they" (doctors and such) suggest that you  bottle break you child at or before a year old.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Nope.  <br>  <br>  I think I introduced the sippy cup at 7 months or so.|`|8wnvhBQTaa	The only time my twins get a bottle is bed time all other milk feeds are in a sippy cup.  I have been doing this since about 8 months old they are nearly 10 months now.|`|KEoChTcdaa	I was told by my doctor to start my son on a sippy cup of water at 5 months so they can get used to it. So no, not too young for the sippy. However, i don't know if you should be using formula in it. For that, I would ask your child's doctor.|`|3cB3qIVuaa	I say if your baby is taking it just fine then let it be. The way I see it, as long as he's getting his vitamins and nutrients he needs then its okay. I on the other hand wouldn't completely take the bottle away just yet but do it gradually.|`|5I4imquJaa	introduce it whenever you like...your baby will tell you if they are ready or not..<br>  <br>  <br>  oh, and be careful with the nuby stuff....<br>  the teat holes are HUGE....... my 15 month old nearly choked on a teat stated for a 9 month old........ i had a suck myself and nearly drowned in it lol|`|6ppi5jeAaa	no...but use water or juice..after 1 year you can use milk|`|LBZPm5rgaa	No it is not too early.  If they sit up on their own and if they can hold a bottle with ease then you can introduce them to a sippy cup. I suggest the ones with the no leak tips.|`|a7DwqEb2aa	you can start weaning your bubba from bottles from 6 months and it should be totally discouraged from the age of one. If your still unsure contact a health visitor|`|ibG0mCxlaa	no, i don't think he is to young at all, I gave my son a sippy cup at 8 months and at 12 months I gave him a regular cup.. it worked out great|`|AORcLwTNaa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmm idk ask a doc|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Definitely not too young. My daughter was started on her sippy at 5 months.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I would try a sippy cup, playtex makes a great one with a very soft spout. I started using it for my baby at 5 months to give her water, and stuff, she was is breast fed only and basically never had a bottle. My doctor told me it was a great idea to get her use to it. Replace is slowly, start with one feeding a day, then move it up. Choose a feeding when he is least fussy. Nine months is not to young at all, they make some for 4 months even.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Nope. Are you talking about the nuby cups with the teat like spout? I am slowly changing my 10 month old over to them. Seems to be going well. I started introducing cups for water at 4 months and started with milk at 9 months, was a struggle to get her using it for milk at first but she is slowly getting there.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son was drinking out of cups with straws at 4 months old.  He used these for daytime feedings and with meals, but still used his bottle at bedtime and in the night until his first birthday.  I would not say 9 months is too young at all.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Nope, not too young.  My daughter was using a sippy cup at 7 months old and completely gave up the bottle at 9 months.
5M5vt5Rnaa	thats a question your going to have to answer.  you need to consider all your expenses: rent, car, food, phone, utilties, whatever bills you have.    why is this in the newborn/baby section?
OBU1eDUHaa	I fed my son  twice a day with the rice.  Once in the early am and once in the pm.  I was told 3-4 days on the spacing of introducing new food.  Try giving the veggies first, because once they get a taste of fruit, there's no going back!  Good luck!|`|dgRTkccBaa	Once a day is probably ok at this point.  3 - 4 days between new foods is usually sufficient.  If it's something that's a common allergen you might want to give an extra day or two just to be safe.|`|W0K9QqEDaa	Try three times a day. That way she will be on a schedule that's easy to stick to. And I have 4 children, and when they were smaller, the doctor always said wait a week b4 new foods only because of food allergies. Ask her doc just to make sure. Also 1 big tip I have, if u notice there is something she doesn't like, wait a week and mix it in with the rice cereal and watch it go!! Good luck, and keep up the good work. Also 4 a little treat, mix the cereal with juice. She'll love it, I'm pretty sure u know that.|`|ocNUYENRaa	I only did it one time a day, usually in mid-morning. That was when my son was the most receptive. Their tummies are no bigger than their fists so she won't be taking much at first. You can wait 3 days and introduce something new.     Here's a great site about baby food and feeding etc. I found it handy because it gives you a bit of a guideline as to how to introduce and when, etc.     wholesomebabyfood.com|`|udPplJTaaa	I just read that you should feed your baby cereal twice a day. Their iron stores start to deplete at 6 months and the cereal is a good source of iron.    Also, my doctor told me feed one jar over a few days to check for allergies. I did 3 or 4 days.
pzLDXL6gaa	For the test or the results?    The test should take about 5 minutes. Results can come back the same day or up to a week later or longer depending on how your health care system works.    Harriet

But, it's unique, which is a good thing.|`|6LYE2VlCaa	Kellan reminds me too much of Kelly so it naturally sounds kinda feminine to me but other than that it sounds great!|`|7qVuZRHfaa	What about [Keilan James]?|`|EhN7kjAhaa	I like the name
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was told that you should wait a total of 3 whole cycles before trying again so your body can adjust. The sooner you try and get pregnant the more of a chance for another miscarriage. Good luck and god bless you!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Because you have had 2 back to back, you should give your body time enough to recover and prepare for another pregnancy. Wait atleast 2 menstrual cycles.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Wait 6 months .|`|gKNRJbVYaa	ask your obgyn...they will be able to tell you..every one is different|`|jD4lixSVaa	So so sorry to hear that! Last March I lost my first baby very early then in May I had my second loss so I know how difficult it is having 2 so close together and even at all! I also Miscarried last month * on my birthday * I didnt wait and I just got another positive hpt. & I'm having light pink spotting now, so far without any cramps. All doctors will tell you different things about when to try again. I figure if you were able to expell in naturally why not? What did the Dr's tell you?|`|91jTS7Epaa	After my miscarriage at 6 weeks, my doctor said to make sure to get one full cycle in between to make sure your body was back to healthy.  Totally a doctor's discretion though.  And every doctor has different beliefs and views on how long.  What does your doctor suggest?|`|ttrA4TiRaa	Well i would give your body at lease 6 months to 1 year!! Pregnancy and miscarriages are VERY VERY HARD on your body.|`|Z7OOXBzXaa	wait 6 weeks is just like u haveing a youngn u got to let u body heel|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I had a mc at 6 weeks in May waited three cycles and got pregnant again and had another mc at 7-8 weeks in Sept. My husband and I decided to try again right away and got pregnant in Oct with our healthy girl! You can be very fertile after a mc so if you are emotionally ready to keep trying I would. Best Wishes!|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Were I in your position, I would ask for a referral to an OB-GYN specializing in high risk, post-miscarriage pregnancy. Before even trying again, I would want to be tested to see if a reason could be found that predisposes me to miscarry early on in gestation. Based upon the results, I would seek treatment to correct my condition, and then I would try again, closely monitored by the physician. I would stay off my feet as much as possible, and do everything else to ensure to the extent that I could, that I carried to term. I'd be asking questions left and right, and making sure I heard the baby's heartbeat once a week, as I'd be concerned about a still birth.<br>  <br>  If there was ever a time to be so overly-cautious as to risk being accused of paranoia, it's now. May God bless you with a healthy baby soon.
b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	If your last period was December 23 and your pregnancy test came back negative I would say that you are most likely not pregnant.  I know that is not what you wanted to hear.  It is likely that you cycle is messed up some how.  Maybe you did not ovulate.  I actually went almost two months with out a period because may cycle was thrown off for some reason.  Eventually the lining of the uterus will shead even if you did not ovulate because it becomes so heavy.  It will cause you to feel bloated.  If you test again and still get a negative I would follow through with your plan to see your doctor. Good luck|`|ihBFGugIaa	Pregnancy Tests are not always accurate.

vue9NOhYaa	Withdrawal has a high failure rate, but, statistically, you have a good chance of NOT getting pregnant -- at least in the fairly short run --  if you use it carefully. "Average" failure rates run around 20-25% a year.  Used perfectly, some studies find failure rates in the 5% range. <br>  <br>  I don't think you  have fertility issues, but if you would 'welcome a baby' why use it at all?  It's frustrating for both of you to have to focus on pulling out 'on time' rather than just enjoying yourselves.|`|AA11987492	Do you see that little guy in my avatar? You can thank the pull out method for him. We used it PERFECTLY for 8 months before I got pregnant, but low and behold, here he is, regardless...|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Me and my last partner used it for years successfully.|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Your playing Russian Roulette.<br>  Guys have dribbles of sperm that come out before he has an orgasm.<br>  You have been very lucky.|`|ACc1skbPaa	I'm confused at what your question is?  If you have done it and not become pregnant and consider that efffective than I guess you answered your own question...I personally wouldn't be comfortable with that as a method as these are bodies we are talking about, not machines and things can happen before you can do anything about it...I wouldn't want to have to think about him pulling out or forgetting to at a moment when my mind should be in a different place, but that's just me...if you are trying to get pregnant then you should talk about that, if not then I guess so far so good for you...but you should probably look into more effective and reliable forms of birth control--like you said: Effective communication with your partner is important and it should begin before you hit the sheets!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you have been lucky...i used it for all of 2 months when i got pregnant with my first, then it worked for 2 years... then it worked for another 2 years, then i fell pregnant within 2 months of a new relationship and it has work again for 1 year.<br>  its not a method, its a chance. there is no proper way to use it since its not a form of birthcontrol. Its only a matter of time before you fall pregnant.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	It worked for me for over 1 year and we were very careful. But eventually I got pregnant. (That pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage, this pregnancy was planned)The pull out method is not effective birth control. It may work for a while but keep in mind that you can get pregnant from pre-*** and all it takes is for one sperm to get loose and make it's way to through your cervix.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	For over 3 yrs it has worked. Our daughter is just over three. And we did not want another anytime soon after her.  I cannot take birth control, I tried several and got sick with each of them. We are both also allergic to latex. And condoms that are a natural material are not in a large size, so thats out too. So we use the pull-out method and so for it works for us.|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Doesn't work.

wlAmUQe3aa	I take it from your question she does open her eyes, just not all the way. If that's right then mention it to the doctor but no panicking!    At 5 days old she is still getting used to seeing bright lights (atfer spending the winter inside your tummy under layers of clothes) so it's quite possibly normal that any light is going to be a big shock to her. You could try seeing how she is when in a fairly darkened room.    I don't think our son opened his eyes fully for a couple of weeks and there's nothing at all wrong with him.|`|Lpl3rnROaa	listen my daughter didnt open her eyes much the first month either. I could call the ped and let them know what is going on. But i dont think its too serious. newborns sleep alot. thats all.|`|gpLnpdEPaa	you need to get her to  doctor right away  normally unless sleeping a newborn opens eyes usually during or right after birth  hurry!! best of luck i hope there is nothing seriously wrong with them.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	i would definitly see someone before friday.  my son who is now six weeks old always had his eyes wide open when he was awake from the day he was born.  this doesnt sound normal. good luck.|`|K3d5yd1Paa	you should def. take your baby to be seen before friday, you should try calling your nurse for more information on that and see what they recommend you to do. My baby is two months old, and when she was only days old she would sleep alot but when she would wake up her eyes would be fully opened.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i would get her seen to. My daughters eyes were open at birth, and in those first few weeks she liked to keep them open as much as she could.  hope your little one is fine- and congrat's!!
ZpmZy03maa	I recommend either the saxophone or the trumpet. Brass instruments are hard to play because you have to adjust your lips for every note. Woodwinds, you basically blow and push some buttons. But brass instruments are very rewarding.  Since the horn isn't on the list, I'll move on. Okay lets go over  them.    1. Trumpet - FUN. Brass, so keep in mind the lip adjusting. But if you start young, he'll learn it fine. It's one of the easiest to learn.     2. Trombone - They sound pretty amazing. Big mouth pieces, so he will need to fill the mouth piece and blow and keep his cheeks from puffing out. The notes may seem easy because all it is is a slide, but there are positions.     3. Saxophone - The easiest instrument to learn and play. Remember that this may be a pain because you are going to need to buy reeds. Buy in bulk, have no problem. Easy and fun.    4. Clarinet - For beginners, this is a good instrument. It's a woodwind, so remember reeds. It may be a bit of a responsibilty because you have to take it apart and clean it after each use.     5. Baritone - I don't have much expirence with this one, but it's similar to a trombone when it comes to mouth pieces. It's a pretty hard instrument to learn. Me, personally do not like the sound it makes. But that's my opinion.    6. Flute - As sexist as it sounds, it's kinda girly isn't it? But I know a male flute player, and he's amazing. So forget I said anything. Okay. Well, this is an instrument that is pretty. It sounds nice, and the notes are actually easy to learn.    7. Oboe - I'm sorry, I don't have any expirenece.    Trumpet - 9/10 for fun, 7/10 easy.     Trombone - 8/10 for fun, 6/10 easy.    Saxophone - 9/10 for fun, 8/10 easy.    Clarinet - 7/10 for fun, 8/10 easy.    Baritone - 6/10 for fun, 5/10 easy.    Flute - 9/10 for fun, 8/10 easy.    Keep in mind this is coming from a 16 year old GIRL. So you really have to ask him.     Also, remember: it takes about a year to learn an instrument, but a lifetime to master it.|`|838VJJGvaa	Clarinet is easy at first, but you need to be determined to succeed.  Good life lesson associated with this.  I play it.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I have spent years teaching young army cadets how to play in the marching band and I play the trumpet primarily as well as any brass instrument that is needed, the clarinet and the alto sax.    1. Trumpet - only has 3 keys so most of the note variation depends on the strength of the players mouth and their wind control.   2. Trombone - slide positions require a lot of practise to get right but it requires less mouth strength at the beginning  3. Sax - cool instrument, more expensive to buy, I recommend playing the clarinet for at least a year before starting the sax  4. Clarinet - great starter reed instrument  5. Baritone - 3 keys like the trumpet (exact same fingering) requires less mouth strength then the trumpet  6. flute - requires a lot of wind control and precise mouth positioning (I'm bias as I've never been able to make one work)  7. Oboe (i'm not sure if it can be played in the band) - Very difficult reed instrument, not a good starter instrument.    It will be easiest for him to play an instrument that his muscles are more naturally suited for. have him flex all the muscles around his mouth (smile and pucker at the same time) if the muscles at the sides of his mouth are stronger then it will be less work to learn a brass instrument, if the muscles on the top and bottom of his mouth are stronger then he will have an easier time with a reed.|`|7HzfgRmwaa	None are easy. They will all require hard work and practice.     Let him choose. If you choose for him he won't want to put the dedication in to learn it. What is HE interested in??|`|BEuyAaKoaa	Clairnet: i play it, its not that hard, and is kinda fun to play|`|SDJ9QlfZaa	6th grade is the start of middle school where I live. And I started to play the Alto Sax in 6th grade. It isn't heavy and it is fun to play. I have been playing it since 6th grade and I am now in 10th. The first year or so it is sort of hard, but once he gets into it and learns how to play it and most of the notes, it is awesome :)|`|mW7mBOAcaa	Flute is most fun, but for a boy......it's considered a mostly femine instument.|`|xYrjfxfzaa	Trombone is fun and easy.But the teacher might get him to try mouthpeices out to see which one he thinks is easiest|`|F5DCpd12aa	I played the oboe for 14 years. It can be played in band, however it is a difficult instrument to learn. However, if you are good at oboe you can get many solos(b/c not a lot of people play it, and potential for scholarships later on). I can also play Sax and it is fairly easy to learn, as is the Clarinet and Flute.|`|prW1i0vzaa	I think he should play trumpet. I'm not saying that it is easy, because no instrument is easy, but there are a few advantages of only having the 3 keys. If he has trouble learning notes, all he has to do is but like 1/3 on his music for first and third buttons. Most of the trumpets in my band do that.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Depends on his lips and mouth. Any are good, but I would talk to his band teacher before he makes a decision.  Remember it is his decision to make.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	The flute is by far the easiest to play|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	it depnds on his physical strength and his personality. If he is an introvert, wants to be part of the team and wants something light to carry then pick a flute. If he enjoys the spotlight and wants to be more fun and take a risk, pick the oboe, it is heavier but my daughter managed it and was recognized for the funny way a young girl looks with such a big funny instrument. It even sounds funny.
EmjEwfQRaa	I have five kids, and can lend a little advice, as for pain relief..that is completely up to you   I have had three without it, and my last two with an epidural. For the hospital bag..I recommend socks to keep your feet warm, and if your not having meds I recommend a focal point such as a sonogram pic. That is about all I ever packed. You may want soaps for your post delivery shower =)   The baby just needs clothes to go home in, everything else is usually provided at the hospital. Take MORE than one outfit for the baby, it will get the first one messy as soon as you put it on..MURPHYS PARENTING LAW...LOL   <br>       As for at home, you will want things to go as smooth as possible at home, so have enough supplies close to where you will be TRYING to sleep, I would have daipers, wipes, petroleum jelly, and nursing pads near by for easy access...These really are just the basics. I was very laid back with all five of mine. Just assure that everything will be easy for you when you get home. Everything else can wait.  Good luck and congratulations from a mom of five|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Don't listen to your sister. You will be fine, just stay relaxed as most things fall right into place. You don't need to worry about things which haven't (or might never) happen. You truly need less to properly care for a child than the media and advertisers make it out to be.<br>  Bring a cute outfit for you and the baby to leave the hospital in, get the car seat in the car (properly), a couple nice nightgowns for you to wear in the hospital in your bag. The hospital will set you up with a few things for the first few days at home. Don't rush out to buy formula just yet, you don't know what he'll eat, and don't be freaked out if your milk doesn't come in right away either. You are doing the right thing, relax, women have done this for eons.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I also had a natural birth and it was well worth it, both baby and I had no side effects and were breastfeeding within 1/2 hour.<br>  <br>  I was a little bit uppity before hand, prepping my bag for the hospital with all sorts of stuff... haha, I never used any of it at the hospital.  I wore the gown - that was fine, I didn't need my own pjs... and the rest of my time was spent with contractions, pushing, nursing or sleeping.<br>  <br>  If you are actively going to take part in the labor (not using drugs) then you don't need magazines and comfy clothes, etc.  You'll be busy and wont' be thinking about it... however if you choose to have an epidural, I can see how you will need something to entertain you while you wait.<br>  <br>  I did pack regular clothes to wear home though, not realizing I would still basically be the size of a blimp after birth... still bring maternity clothes!  haha|`|sxsx9sHNaa	I packed mine ina l 8 or 9 months.  Don't worry a pretty nightgown or undies, youll be bleeding so much you won't care and you won't want to bleed on your stuff.  Bring the baby an outfit, you an outfit, makup or whatever (for pictures when you take the baby home)  and plenty of change or cash (for hubby or friend, think vending machines and cafeteria)|`|SKJsfRImaa	Bring your favorite shower toiletries and comfy clothes- they will help you feel clean and rejuvenated. Also bring your phone and a charger. I over packed because I thought I would be bored in the hospital but I was so in love with my baby I just wanted to hold him all the time. Bring a book though just in case you get bored when baby is sleeping. If you will have a significant other with you make sure they have something to keep them entertained and some snacks. Also don't forget the camera! I'm not saying for the delivery necessarily, but to get photos of what baby looks like just born because they grow soooo fast!
AA11148769	"I Loved Her First" - Heartland    "Cinderella" - Steven Curtis Chapman    "Butterfly Kisses" - Bob Carlisle    Here's the lyrics to each song:    I LOVED HER FIRST:    Look at the two of you dancing that way  Lost in the moment and each others face  So much in love you're alone in this place  Like there's nobody else in the world  I was enough for her not long ago  I was her number one  She told me so  And she still means the world to me  Just so you know  So be careful when you hold my girl  Time changes everything  Life must go on  And I'm not gonna stand in your way    But I loved her first and I held her first  And a place in my heart will always be hers  From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  And I prayed that she'd find you someday  But it's still hard to give her away  I loved her first    How could that beautiful woman with you  Be the same freckle face kid that I knew  The one that I read all those fairy tales to  And tucked into bed all those nights  And I knew the first time I saw you with her  It was only a matter of time    But I loved her first and I held her first  And a place in my heart will always be hers  From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  And I prayed that she'd find you someday  But it's still hard to give her away  I loved her first    From the first breath she breathed  When she first smiled at me  I knew the love of a father runs deep  Someday you might know what I'm going through  When a miracle smiles up at you  I loved her first       CINDERELLA:    She spins and she sways to whatever song plays,  Without a care in the world.  And I'm sitting here wearing the weight of the world on my shoulders.  It's been a long day and there's still work to do,  She's pulling at me saying "Dad I need you!  There's a ball at the castle and I've been invited and I need to practice my dancin'"  "Oh please, daddy, please!"    [Chorus:]  So I will dance with Cinderella  While she is here in my arms  'Cause I know something the prince never knew  Oh I will dance with Cinderella  I don't want to miss even one song  'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight  And she'll be gone.    [Verse 2:]  She says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed  She wants to know if I approve of the dress  She says, "Dad the prom is just one week away  And I need to practice my dancin'  "Oh please, daddy , please!"    [Chorus:]  So I will dance with Cinderella  While she is here in my arms  'Cause I know something the prince never knew  Oh I will dance with Cinderella  I don't want to miss even one song  'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight  And she'll be gone    [Verse 3:]  But she came home today with a ring on her hand  Just glowin' and tellin' us all they had planned  She says, "Dad the wedding's still six months away but I need to practice my dancin'  "Oh please, daddy , please!"    [Chorus:]  So I will dance with Cinderella  While she is here in my arms  'Cause I know something the prince never knew  Oh I will dance with Cinderella  I don't want to miss even one song  'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight  And she'll be gone        BUTTERFLY KISSES:    Butterfly Kisses lyrics    There's two things I know for sure.  She was sent here from heaven, and shes daddys little girl.  As I drop to my knees by her bed at night,  She talks to Jesus, and I close my eyes.  And I thank God for all the joy in my life, But most of all...  Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  "Walk beside the pony daddy, its my first ride."  "I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried."  Oh, with all that Ive done wrong, I must have done something right.  To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night.    Sweet sixteen today.  Shes looking like her momma a little more every day.  One part woman, the other part girl.  To perfume and makeup, from ribbons and curls.  Trying her wings out in a great big world. But I remember...    Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer.  Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  "You know how much I love you daddy, but if you dont mind,  Im only going to kiss you on cheek this time."  With all that Ive done wrong, I must have done something right.  To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night.    All the precious time.  Like the wind, the years go by.  Precious butterfly, spread your wings and fly.    Shell change her name today.  Shell make a promise, and Ill give her away.  Standing in the bride room just staring at her.  She asked me what Im thinking, and I said, "Im not sure,  I just feel like Im losing my baby girl."  Then she leaned over... and gave me...    Butterfly kisses, with her mama there.  Stickin little white flowers all up in her hair.  "Walk me down the aisle daddy, its just about time."

wl7tlYOYaa	I didnt know I was ovulating but when I counted back and all that the day I had sex was exactly my day of ovulation and I got preggers so your chances are pretty good. But to increase your chances start having sex 3-4 days before ovulation the ovulation day and two days after you gotta take advantage of all your fertile days to increase your chances. <br>  <br>  I know the day I got pregnant because it was the first time me and hubby did it all the way as in he didnt pull out lol|`|v3LnJycKaa	ummm thats when most women get pregnant? <br>  <br>  If you had sex today it would still take a day or two for the sperm to reach and fertilze the egg, so yes technically you would get pregnant from this ovulation period, but we wouldnt be able to tell you if it would be today or not as I dont know how fast your husbands sperm swim|`|Imn5oOWiaa	Every ovulation day for the last 16 months i've been trying to concieve. Nothing has happened yet. It really all depends on the person. But there are a lot of different things you should do if you want a baby. <br>  <br>  go to babycenter.com it has all the information on there for women trying to have a baby. <br>  <br>  [hope i helped]|`|h4UzjZVnaa	Have you had intercourse in the last few days? If so, that will better your chances then actually just having intercourse the day of ovulation. Your ovulation window is between 12-24 hrs. I'm not 100% on how long it can take the sperm meet the egg. So it could be too late.. But try anyways!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I'm in the same situation as the first person.  I didn't notice I was ovulating until I counted back on my cycle and it was day 14 when I conceived.  If you're actively trying to conceive, you have a 20% chance of getting pregnant.  Baby dust!|`|hAXJ47iAaa	It's not unheard of...but the best way to conceive is to make sure you TTC the days leading up to ovulation so sperm is there waiting for the egg...not the other way around...as sperm can survive for up to 5 days and the egg has a life of about 12 hours.<br>  Good luck|`|61e43026c2296d0395ca66a2a1b35b79aa	It really depends. Your chances are good. For me we had sex the day after the online tracker I used said I was ovulating and here I am pregnant now. I think it really depends on factors like the regularity of your period. Mine was typically 1-2 days different from the previous month. We had been ttc for 4 years but it wasn't until after my last surgery it was successful and my periods seemed to almost be regular. Just make sure that you are charting your basil temp, checking your mucus, and going by your last period and should be able to narrow down that ovulation window like we did. Have sex 3-4 days before and after the ovulation day and hopefully you will soon have a baby in the oven! Good luck and don't give up :0)

I met a Shaina, which I think is lovely, too.|`|4ALTFZ3paa	I used to have a friend when I was a freshman in college named Shauna or Shawna (I was never exactly sure how she spelled it). She was Canadian, so I think it's a Canadian thing because I'd never heard of it before and haven't heard of it since.    It's not my most favorite name in the world, but it's not bad.|`|54UFMjBSaa	i LOVe it|`|lAc7NJTUaa	yes but its shawna|`|okgr5aPCaa	I always picture a really rough girl when I hear this name.

5vtVsqx6aa	Yes, Cade is a real name and is used often. According to this site it's unisex, but sounds more masculine to me.  It was originally an English last name.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	Yes, its a real name. My cousin had her first little boy in April 2005 & named him Cade Utah. (no his middle name isnt after a state, its after her brother Steven Utah whom passed away about 8yrs ago & she wanted to honor his memory)<br>  <br>  I love the name Cade.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Yep. Cade is one of my favorite boy names too. BUT... since Caiden/Cayden/Caden has gotten SO popular, I won't use it anymore. A majority of those millions of Caiden's are going to use Cade as a nickname, I'm sure.....|`|8Gcyr0T1aa	My husbands cousin named her son Urijiah Cade Biddle.

atcEtDQSaa	have you tried giving her warm milk?|`|koVk3P9Gaa	If you think it's because she looses her pacifier, put like 3 or 4 of them in w/ her, then she can just reach for one.  If it's not that, you are just going to have to let her put herself back to sleep.  It will be tough for a few nights, but it will work.
bpMBiL9Xaa	So are you turning 13?    For my 13th birthday last year I went to the movies, then we went out for dinner with 5 friends.    Other 13th bdays I've been to have been:  -Bowling   -Sleepover - in a tent  -Hired part of an indoor sports ground and played games  -Games at home with a movie and pizza    Game ideas:  - Truth or dare  - Blowing a ping pong ball around a timed course with a straw  - Design an outfit in pairs with only newspaper, plastic bag, ribbon, sticky tape  - A relay race with things like running with a ball between your knees.      I hope this helped.
K7AqDR9gaa	mine was a week before my missed period.and it was pinkish brownish in color,kinda slimy[sorry lol,but im just trying to give you all the details] i only had to wipe twice and it was done,wore panty liners for the night and when i woke up there was just a spotting of brown.continued really really REALLY lightly throughout the day and it was gone...  hope i helped!good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|opLajSnMaa	it could possibly be implantation bleeding it usually happens about a few days before your period would normally start its fairly light with pinkish or brown blood. its not a lot of bleeding, some women cant even notice it until they wipe. and it only lasts about 1-2 and half days. some women confuse it with spotting but its nothing like a normal period.  youre also showing some common signs of an early pregnancy...you say you dont want to test but i would just to make sure. :)
5DK546BUaa	Looks like Uriah and Elijah smashed together...  Which is how most people will want to pronounce it... yoo-RIE-j?  not a very pleasant sound at all...    However, either of the two names un-smashed are very nice :)  and Uriah is pronounced "yoo-RIE-?", meaning "God is my light" - Is this what you were going for?|`|bIaywrBCaa	not too fond of it|`|DZJsQFGAaa	Hey there!  I like it   Although, I think he will have to spell it a lot  It's very unique|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sorry, no like.|`|r6TijtS8aa	I like the name Uriah for a girl, I know someone who is named that, but it doesn't really sound like a boys name and the spelling is a little funny...|`|hcqNXUH5aa	Isn't that a body part?|`|7Dpz81d5aa	I don't like it.....sorry.    Hope I helped :-)|`|urJIlSBQaa	I think that he'll be spelling his name for people all his life.

52bAHCaUaa	I would. It says it goes bad after a month, I wouldn't want to risk it myself.    Is it possible to buy smaller cans?|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Yep, it should be used up in one month after opening.    I would suggest buying the individual packets of formula if you are only giving one bottle a day.  I know enfamil has packets that make four ounces at a time.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	You sure are. If you are only using one bottle a day worth of formula then I would buy the individual packets of formula. I know Enfamil puts them out. one packet makes 4 oz of formula. This way you aren't wasting your money on formula that you are throwing out which could be expensive.|`|xDBZVswtaa	yes i would def throw it out...i would look to see if the brand u use makes singles so u r not wasting formula or money...try to get samples at the drs office also...|`|qkpFuIfeaa	Yes, you should definitely throw away....try buying cans in smallest portions possible....12 oz I think.....|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	yes, i would throw it away.  if it says so on the can then its written there for a reason :)    if i were you i would just get smaller cans this way you can use it up within a month.|`|P7VdWn7baa	Try putting it in the refrigerator? maybe freezing it? maybe you could call the   on the back of can and ask them? I know I bought a generic can of formula a big can for a low price, to see if he would take it, and relized I still wanted to BF and now have a huge can of formula GL
1dVrFHctaa	If the one you took was 20 IU/L and the one at the clinic was 50 IU/L then you could be pregnant and the test you took was more sensitive because tests that are 20 IU/L pick up smaller amounts of HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin, the hormone released when the egg implants into the wall of your uterus) Also if the line was faded there a good chance that your pregnant and when you took the test there was only the smallest amount of HCG present in your urine. Maybe take another test, one that is 20 IU/L, and do it in the morning because HCG will be more concentrated in your urine.|`|PSpK0vEoaa	I would take it again when your pregnant your body produces HCGs maybe you havent produce alot for the line to be darker but all my tests i took for all came back with a faded line|`|dxTwHB1yaa	Even if it's faded - there is a pretty good chance you're pregnant. The pregnancy test might not have been sensitive enough to detect.|`|PbPKSNlLaa	umm idk go take one more test and see what that one reads but by what your saying i dont think you are pregnet
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	No coughing wont hurt the baby.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    No baby is very safe inside.  Coughing wont hurt baby. As they grow. they begin moving at 7 weeks.  usually when mum coughs baby moves sometimes & reacts  So its perfectly finedarling.    god bless|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No...our bodies wouldn't let us cough while pregnant if it was going to hurt the baby. You mean you are 5 weeks right? They go by the date of your last period.|`|XmEqZfjaaa	No, you won't harm the baby at all. Its probably early ligament stretching.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	3 weeks? You mean 3 weeks since conception?    And no, your uterus is expanding. Wait til your muscles start stretching!|`|4lpJRXYsaa	haha i asked this question to my mom a couple of weeks ago and a few other people... no it will not hurt your baby. Your baby is secure
RvddYKqjaa	That's just how some people are. There is nothing wrong with him. I am always the one who is warm, and for years I heard it was hormonal. I just run a slightly higher temperature than others do. I'm seldom if ever cold. There is a 12-year old in our family who never needs a coat. On a blustery snowy day, he walks home from school with his coat over his shoulder. Who can figure? You've had medical tests done and you say he is fine. Just accept that he's not wired the same as some others are. I don't think it has anything to do with autism, but I'm sure you have asked your doctor that question. Tell him I complain about being warm all the time too! It feels terrible to be the only one who is warm.|`|kkXc4hAIaa	keep her room cold or the house low temp make sure he drinks ice cold water and at night before he goes to bed put a nice cold rag on his head|`|OBn4a7rzaa	Im not sure how valid my answer is...but when i was younger (sometime before 3rd grade) i can remember always compaining that i was hot. I can remember getting so frustrated about being hot that i would start to cry, lol. To this day, i HATE being hot. I dont cry anymore (thank God lol) but it bothers me to be somewhere stuffy, where there is no air flow. And when i get in the car in the summer time, it really gets to me if someone turns on the radio before the air condition, bc its SO hot! I never asked the doctor about it, bc its not that drastic, its just my little quirk. Usually i keep the air condition on 68 when we sleep, with the fan on high...and during the day ill put it on 70. The fans are never turned off as long as we are home though. Maybe your son will just be the same way, and there isnt really anything wrong with it.|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	weird question|`|T0pkW783aa	If he doesn't have a fever, he just may be someone who feels the heat more than others do.  I am like that, too.  May have something to do with his metabolism.  If he isn't sick and has no fever, it isn't anything to worry about.  You can mention it to his doctor and see what he says; it may just be his normal state of being.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	chubby, thirsty?  give him lots of water...|`|Jlbhd6duaa	mayeb hes chubby or he has a fever??

54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Me and my fiance have his son try everything that he hasnt had before but we also make sure he knows that if he doesnt like it he can spit it out. We do it just because you never know if you like something unless you try it. But his son is good about it he doesnt try to argue or anything with it and I think he is okay doing it bc he knows its okay to spit it out if he doesnt like it.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You can always ask and children change their likes as they get older.  But never force a child to eat what they do no like.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Your kids need to eat what you cook for them.  Make things they like, but if they don't want dinner that's too bad.  Your child does not run the house, you do, and you make the rules.    When I was a kid if we didn't eat our dinner we would have to eat it for breakfast, or lunch until it was gone.    It's wrong to waste perfectly good food.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	asking yes, forcing, no|`|P544Sbmqaa	I always require at least one normal size bite.  Kids, especially small children, will often refuse to eat things based on lookm color, or texture, NOT taste.  I dont believe in forcing kids to eat what they dont like, but I PROMISE you if you let them refuse to eat whatever they refuse to eat, you will have a picky child who wont eat anything.  I know because that is what my parents did and I am the pickiest person in the world.  So, I make the kids try at least one bite.  If they dont like it after one bite, fine, but claiming they dont like something or refusing to eat before they have tried it is NOT an option.    As an older teen, sure, fixing alternatives could be an option.  But as a small child when they are learning to eat new things...  NOT a chance.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You are right in this regard, except for one thing - you need to get them to try it again. A nutritionist I heard recently said that it takes 10 tries to get something as part of your diet.   As a family, it's much better all around for everyone to eat the same meal. Of course, there are exceptions with allergies - and of course, over time, there are just some foods (hopefully not many) that a child just cannot stomach to eat. With our son, it's dressing (like for chicken or turkey). Whether it's the taste or texture, he's even not quite sure. He'll try different kinds, made by different people, etc. just to see what it is - but other things he's not thrilled about, like tomatoes, he will eat - just not love them.  About the liver, LOL. My dad used to bribe me at the table and offer to pay me per bite. I just couldn't do it - though I would try. I love the smell - but for me, it's the texture - just grosses me out.  However, I made sure this bias didn't pass to our son. I would still make liver for him and my husband - and I wouldn't eat it - I'd have something else, and just say 'Oh, I'll have these leftovers," or whatever. My son didn't twig in til he was a teen that I wasn't actually eating the liver! Too bad, by then he LOVED it.|`|HMF4BXbNaa	Certain foods should be introduced at certain stages, I think. I wouldn't give a 3 year old escargo or liver and expect them not to throw a tantrum.. but a 10 year old, sure.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Asking a child to try new foods is a wonderful idea. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that concept.    However,  If your planning on shoveling it down his throat and punishing him for not trying a food it is wrong.|`|dgRTkccBaa	It's not wrong to ask a child to try something, but I do think it's wrong to force them to eat it if they really don't like it after they've tried it. I generally try to make at least one thing I know my kids like with dinner if I'm cooking something new.  I guess I agree with both of you, both your views are pretty extreme, I think somewhere in the middle is a good place.  Mom is not a short order cook, but if you really truly hate your dinner you can have a sandwich.|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	I think you can ask your child to try something, and even slightly pressure them into it, but I don't think you should force them if you honestly have another option available. My sister is in the 'don't make them try it' field, and my niece won't eat anything, not even eggs. It's SO aggravating, because we always have to make her something different. I've gotten to the point where I lie to her sometimes (like calamari was chicken rings, and lo mien that I made was spaghetti with chicken). My 2 year old daughter however will try anything. She doesn't like everything, like she hates apple pie, but she'll try it...several times even. She just spits it out into her napkin if she doesn't like it (which is what we taught her, and i think is appropriate for young children...verses spitting it halfway across the table). She loves garlicky, oniony, anything....I really think that you should teach your children to try things, because what if they're at someones house one day and they're served something they don't like. WHat will they do, say "make me something different". And what about nutritional value? if you let them eat whatever they want, they may end up living a chicken fingers and candy childhood like my niece.|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Asking them to try something is OK, but don't tell them or force them to try it, they will try it when there ready.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I always hated veggies but Dad would say have a cube(squash) or have a spoonful etc. I respected and obeyed my father when I grew up I rarely eat veggies but that is just me.    Kids shouldn't control the household parents should always give kids new stuff to at least try there is nothing wrong with your idea. But personally I think your gf is high maintenance allready, I would lose her and find someone on your own wave length. I don't see you 2 are going to be able to have children without difficulties in upbringing and there are plenty of gals that would agree with your thoughts.|`|mjTmQzvFaa	I can see both yours and your gf point of view, but no as long you don't force the child to try it that is fine, but asking the child to take a small bite and see if he or she likes it , no their is nothing wrong with it at all. The child may surprise you and like it, if not then that is fine too , if you decide to have that another time for a meal , then just make something you know your child will eat. If anything when trying something new with a child take and put a small piece of it on the plate , have a napkin there and a drink to wash the taste out of the child's mouth if they don't like it and ask them calmly to try a bite and see if they like it and tell them if not then it is okay to spit it out in the napkin and drink something to get the taste out of their mouth. If anything say maybe look mommy or daddy is going to try this right along with you. Hope the idea helped some . Good luck.
lTDeZ0Obaa	No, you cannot ovulate faster. You ovulate once a month, one egg per month. A fertility specialist can give fertility drugs to stimulate more eggs to be released, but this usually takes time and needs medical necessity. Not just a personal desire or time line.     http://www.babycenter.com/0_fertility-dr...|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	well best wishes to you guys. but i haven't heard of any ways to ovulate any faster...|`|VzEfgidCaa	You can't ovulate faster...|`|kkXc4hAIaa	u cant but if really want preg quick jsut keep doing it and doing it and doin it like 3 time a day maybe more or less idk what ur scedule is|`|S5n5Za78aa	you cannot rush mother nature!!!|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	You cannot "ovulate faster". Your body will ovulate when it is ready. The best you can do is have sex during your fertile period [typically 10-18 days after the start of your period] and use ovulation predictor kits to know exactly when you ovulate. If you aren't ovulating, you should see an OB/GYN to see what the problem is. Also, even though you have a "deadline", don't stress yourself out. Stress delays and can prevent ovulation from occurring and can do the same to menstrual cycles, which will make becoming pregnant take longer. Good luck.
52bAHCaUaa	You're baby doesn't even need you anymore! Give it up for adoption!!|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	No, it's not LEGAL that far a long. You should have thought about that before getting pregnant.|`|AA11530601	no but i heard someone on here saying last night that there was a service where you could anonymously drop off your baby no quesions asked up to 30 days after giving birth. Im sure it was in the States. They might have more info on that the in hospitals. Or you could give it up for adoption.    By the way, you are aware that 9 months is 32weeks? and you want an abortion at 31? lots of ppl give birth at 31 weeks anyway. They would never give you one. That kid is practically fully formed of course they cant take it out of you and then kill it for you. I am pro choice but its not really a fetus any more, its practically a fully functioning kid.|`|LN9FXnKPaa	yeah, its probably too late for that. why did you not think of it much earlier in the term?|`|AGcwdZGmaa	no and your sick for even thinking about it you know a baby can feel pain from 12 weeks whats wrong with you grow up and take responsibility for your actions|`|lrBC1dxqaa	NO! Not legally, or safely anyway. I would never chastise you for having an abortion at a relative date to the conception, but at 31 weeks you are SICK for wanting an abortion. In case you weren't aware you are only about 8 or 9 weeks from your due date. Stick it out, and find adoptive parents that can not conceive on their own and want to adopt your child while you are waiting to have it. Ridiculous. ABSOLUTELY ridiculous!|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	no.. why would you even think about it?...|`|RTxFNURzaa	Have a heart and keep the child|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Simply, no. Look into adoption at this point. Don't try to ditch the baby after it is born either. That is really frowned upon and very illegal.|`|3Ncriah6aa	i dont believe so .. i think its only from about 6-14 weeks. i could be wrong but thats what i remember. Not to be rude but you are 31 weeks pregnant you would be absolutely crazy to get an abortion now you already have a relationship with that baby and in a few more weeks you will give birth to it. dont be selfish mama|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Just have the baby and put it up for the adoption.    You should have thought about this 31 weeks ago. You decided to let the baby develop, now allow it to be born.     I hate to tell you this, but actions have CONSEQUENCES.|`|QSodlfMraa	err what????|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	do you know what you're baby looks like right now? it is a human.it can live out side the womb !   i just think you are going thru depression & stress at the moment.  talk to you're doctor about it.|`|8bPmTLT0aa	No i don't think any place will let you get one that far in your pregnancy|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	nooooooo dont|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	the child could now live on its own.  put the baby up for adoption.|`|lhbEY5eJaa	no that is way to far in your pregnancy  it would be dangerous to have an abortion at this time  and to all of you being rude and telling her that she is retarted to ask this question stop making rude comments  you may not agree with abortion and thats fine but dont go being rude about it  everyone has the freedom of choice of what to do and not do  abortion is against my religon and i do not tell people not to go get abortions because it is not my say.    P.S. adoption is probably your only option now           sorry  good luck:)|`|B07sKfdvaa	Not legally, safely, or ethically|`|8c31015e5379247f495631e2d02da1afaa	you need to look into alternatives at this point, someone out there would love to adopt your baby, it is way too late for abortion....good luck|`|LiPoEBenaa	You have a living, viable baby inside you. You can't do a 3rd trimester abortion in the states. Just consider adoption...you've made it this far anyways|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Are you crazy? First of all who would want an abortion at 31 weeks? Who would want an abortion at all? The baby is perfectly able to live outside the womb now. There is no way you can have an abortion now...|`|5BOhn6Ubaa	i think abortion would have been fine at an earlier stage.  at this point u could give it up for adoption and if u life in pennsylvanina theres the safe haven program now.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	At 31 weeks, the baby could live outside the womb...nobody will give you an abortion....     Look how big the baby is:  http://www.pregnancyhut.com/wp-content/u...  He/She is about 16inchs long and weighs about 3-4lbs    why not wait a few weeks and then give the baby up for adoption if you don't want it...?|`|Ur9dwWRraa	Even if you were able to find someone who would deliver your baby at this advanced stage of pregnancy, it would be counted as a premature birth, as the baby would likely be born alive, and even if it died, it would be classed as a stillbirth, not an abortion.    It's too late for you to get rid of the baby in this way and if you were to try and take matters into your own hands, at this stage you would likely be charged with murder, on the basis that the child would likely be live born.|`|NaYb4CnGaa	as for now it is illegal so no doc will do it for you. Why would you want to have an abortion after carrying a BABY for 31 weeks. If you don't want the baby put it up for adoption. there are tons of people who are unable to have children themselves. Give your baby a chance whether its with you as its mother or someone else.|`|b9MbC3Uraa	No. It's really developed .....  http://www.babycenter.com/fetal-developm...    You only have 9 weeks left... If you really don't want it or can't handle a child give it up for adoption. Please just wait, you've gone for all those weeks of suffering why give up now?    I wish I had a stable enough life or else I would gladly take it!|`|qWU7huiUaa	I cant imagine that you are serious but... you need to go seek some counseling and help. I think that for you to be all of a sudden wanting to make this choice this far along means something drastic must have happened in your life. Please remember that whatever situation you may be facing is temporary, this childs life has already began and is not so temporary. Please look at the bigger picture and remember that the Lord says "this too shall pass.." No matter what your struggles are he is there with you and will see you through if you allow him to. I am 5 months with a baby boy and already can't imagine life without him. PLEASE CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS!!! Adoption is widely available and your child could have a wonderful life.     Please be advised before you go to this that it is horrible, but i think you need a shock back into reality:  http://www.timandmelanie.com/images/abor...|`|oLsMOmp8aa	Don't even ask a question like this. Go to church. I pray it will change your mind.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Hi and NO..If you dont want it, Ill adopt it.  Good grief!|`|VMMq3C35aa	I am in no way judging you, but if you've come that far along in your pregnancy, why not just give birth and find someone to adopt?|`|s2X1Wcliaa	Abortion is murder! The least you could do is put it up for adoption if you don't want it.|`|TeIDixQTaa	I am pro choice, but after 24 weeks the foetus is fully formed.  Children have been born at 23 weeks and have lived.  Aborting at 31 weeks is murder, nothing less. Keep in mind that I am pro-abortion, but I find that despicable.    It's also illegal to abort past 20 weeks in the UK, so the USA is probably similar.  Put the baby up for adoption if you really don't want it.|`|07d2086aa27d1ba3ef711ade9372b259aa	Uh no! And why the hell would you?? Do you realize how developed your baby is at 31 weeks???? That's almost 8 months pregnant!!! What is the matter with you? The baby would feel everything. Can you really live with knowing that you did that to your baby? Putting it through all that pain before ending it's life?????? You're sick in your damn head!|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	No, not unless there is an urgent medical reason that is threatening your health in which case, talk to your doctor. However, if you are unable or unwilling to continue your pregnancy, you are almost certainly far enough along that you can schedule an immediate Caesarian section. Your child doesn't need your body to survive anymore anyway, so gift him/her to one of the desperate loving families who are looking for a child to care for. A great solution for you both, and certainly better for your child.|`|0VUZacRTaa	at 31 weeks the baby could be born and survive. its a bit too late for abortion. this is a ridiculous question and you are ridiculous.|`|0nSPx4nxaa	Have you no heart?!   Keep the baby. By now the baby is alive and taking its somewhat first breaths! **** us considered a live human being. THats like me killing you.  Dont get an abortion becasue at the point it is living. Just either keep it or give it up for adoption.  Abortion is WRONG!!|`|YSOuPsqvaa	You can't now, your too far along if you were 6 months then yeah you could, but now your kinda stuck having the baby and giving it up for adoption.|`|MlQnoWXbaa	Please don't kill the baby! You've already came this far. Give it up for adoption. Somebody will love that baby.|`|Xngq54vBaa	This week, your baby measures over 16 inches long. He weighs about 3.3 pounds (try carrying four navel oranges) and is heading into a growth spurt. He can turn his head from side to side, and his arms, legs, and body are beginning to plump out as needed fat accumulates underneath his skin. He's probably moving a lot, too, so you may have trouble sleeping because your baby's kicks and somersaults keep you up.   Babies (with time in the NICU, obviously) can LIVE at 31 weeks.      No, you can't have an abortion.  Consider adoption.|`|TOoNHNv9aa	no one will do an abortion at 31 weeks. that baby should just be born and be given up for adoption.  you've made it this far...why should you end it now?|`|Zh2o1RWGaa	I have to say it. At 31 weeks that baby is a baby to have an abortion would be murder|`|tsdDMCDCaa	You can go straight to hell. I heard its hot there!
qfO2wQPJaa	Why do you have a NEED to have foster children? If DEFACS doesn't want to help, why do you need to help?|`|zRzb1scdaa	maybe convince them to let him take a breathalyzer test every week for a while to prove he is not an alcoholic.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	There's some holes in this story. If you got one foster kid taken away because of something like this. You won't be getting anymore anytime soon,if at all.
2irmTjQ3aa	There is always a slight chance|`|Q4NlafqBaa	Take a minute to just relax and calm down. Periods can fluctuate tremendously when you are young. It doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant.    There's probably a small chance that you could be if you haven't been careful in your fooling around. If so, you would need to have a talk with your parents and your bf. I think you would find them more understanding than you'd think. You see, the baby isn't a curse; it's a blessing, even if you were a little too young to be fooling around with a boy in the first place.    If you are NOT pregnant... my suggestion would be to put the hanky panky on hold until you are ready for the consequences. Because honestly, it isn't a very large step to get from where you are to intercourse, even with the best of intentions... believe me, I've seen it happen again and again.    Respect yourself and control yourselves... just enjoy being companions with your clothes on. good luck!  =)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test if you are worried but I doubt you are pregnant. Stop doing the masturbation thing if you are worried it will get you pregnant or at least have him wipe off his hands.|`|BKr3y30maa	You are definetly too young to have a baby.  Don't take any chances is what I say.  If you would get pregnant and decide to have an abortion....there is always the possibly of damage to your uterus during surgery (D&C) .   You wouldn't want to hurt any chances of you being able to get pregnant WHEN you are in fact ready in the future.  Children are blessings, but only take a chance when you are 100% ready.|`|30vtoWmRaa	for one you need to slow down your only 13 your a baby
sk46uigvaa	i would say twice a day, 1pm and 8pm is when i normally do it.  Don't drink before hand and don't pee, let the urine build up so you can catch your LH surge.    I did my first ovulation test on Friday CD10 and tested positive then i tested again today tuesday CD14 positive again!!    I had negatives all the days in between friday and today, don't know whats going on, shall have to wait and see.    good luck    Sunny day is wrong, DO NOT test in the morning your LH levels are highest after 1pm, also test from cycle day 7-8.|`|abAaKBt1aa	I would invest in a Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor.  The monitor will ask for test sticks day 6 through day 20 until it gets to know your body and then it will ask for only 10 sticks a month.  You let the monitor know when you are having the first day of your cycle, and it will tell you when you are at your lowest level of fertility and at your peak.  You can also double check the results by also testing with another cheaper ovulation predictor kit.|`|o4kkU2kSaa	Try 11 days after your menstrual cycle only in the morning because your levels are at its highest in the am hours.
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? No. He doesn't need a cell phone. He just wants to fit in. If he wants one, he should buy it himself. ??|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes It also can save his life, if he gets into a problem.  My 11 and 13 have Cell phones. You have to teach them to respect the privilege.|`|0NkrNStxaa	yes just in case of emergencies...but you can buy a prepaid plan and only give him a certain amount of minutes a month to limit his usage|`|hRRsnfglaa	YES HOW ELSE U SUPOSSE TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE REAL WORLD DUMB ***|`|IuIp7Eevaa	absolutley|`|e158WyFGaa	Sure.To hang wit buddies and call and text.I got mine first cell at 14.|`|838VJJGvaa	If he really needs one for emergencies and rides, but wait until he stops complaining.  That is just rewarding him for acting like a baby.  I got my first cell when I was 12, but I needed it.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	he doesnt NEED one until he starts going out with friends who drive really. but if you want to get him one, im sure he would absolutely love it. just depends on what you can afford at the time.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	if you get him the phone, you can put restrictions on it or get a special plan for younger teens.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	a 13 year old in my opinion only needs a phone outside of home to get ahold of you or for you to call him to make sure every things ok|`|T3T9geFiaa	My brother is 13 also and he just got a cell phone for Christmas. He bought a 'pay as you go' phone. He mainly uses it to call my parents when he's out with his friends or he'll be staying late at school. He pays for his own minutes. By getting the 'pay as you go' he only has to pay for the minutes that he uses, instead of paying a bill monthly when he doesn't use the phone that often.    To answer your question, yes, I think he should get the phone but he should help pay for it.|`|zRzb1scdaa	no, but then again i dont even have ten friends|`|Lt13vqFraa	Of course, my nine year old brother has one, and they actually use for needs, and they are great for emergencies, believe him, HE NEEDS IT.|`|kDvKc3npaa	he doesn't NEED one, but it is nice for your kids too have.    You will always be able to get a hold of him, he can easily contact you if something happens and he's not near a phone, and, if your tired of not having a house phone, you'll get your house phone back.    I would say to get him one on a plan, maybe the plan you're already on as it could be cheaper to do that.      In most plans nights and weekends are free and unlimited texting doesn't cost very much at all.    You may be getting him the phone for you, but give him a little freedom with it, i'm sure he doesn't want the phone to only be able get a hold of you, he wants it to be able to get a hold of his friends as well.    I wouldn't listen to the people who say don't let him have texting, make it a pre-paid and all that.  although pre-paid's are good for teaching, they aren't good when he runs out of minutes and money in a situation where he NEEDs to get a hold of you.|`|UD1ki1I1aa	yeahh i don't like know more than 3 13 year olds without a phone.  be sure to get texting for him, its beast.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	only a prepaid one for contact with you while he's out. he can use it to talk to his friends but he has to pay for the minutes with chore money.|`|vks73GiAaa	umm im 16 and i beg my mom to get me one and i was suppose to pay half for the bill and at first i thouhgt i was so cool an now i use it maybe 2 a month unless i get more numbers of girls lol its all up to u if hes a social person then i would but make him earn it thts wht i had to do lol unless he already has|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	Yea I'm 13 and don't know anyone that doesn't have a phone.  And if he is social and going out alot it is a good way to stay in contact with you.|`|i171LlfTaa	I think that it is fine for you to buy him a cell phone, just make sure he gets to pick it out and things because then he can have a cool new phone instead of something that his mother would pick out for him. Most kids have phones even younger then 13 so there is no big deal that he should have one now. Most people have phones so he can interact with them in that way.|`|RdatK8wlaa	NO. There are 10-year-olds in my brother's class with them. IT'S PATHETIC.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	In this day n' age, yes.    But not for entertainment or, social purposes.  Only for emergencies.  Do not allow texting as part of the plan.  Financially, You would regret it, if you did.    Also, You need to read up on cell phone radiation.|`|6gthdHpnaa	You shouldn't get him a cell phone just because he talks on the phone all the time or just because all his friends have one.  But I think a cell phone would be a good idea (as long as it's prepaid) so he could reach you in an emergency.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	nobody "needs" a cell phone, especially at 13 yrs old.     if i was the parent, i would make him save up money from allowances or chores and wat not so he can buy one himself. he would appreciate it more in the end.|`|PExOJJLgaa	Depends on how mature and responsible he is.  I don't know anyone in my grade without a phone..  except for maybe like one person.  its the truth.    I got a $230 phone as my first phone when I was 13.  I'm responsible, and that's the only reason my parents got me one.  If he isn't, get him a prepaid one (if you're sure he'll go over)    or buy a non expensive one.    prepaid phones are, however, really expensive, while you can add a line to your plan for $10.|`|9f0eb3ac244a30553e7164baead93341aa	Not nessesarly but it does help in life to have a cell phone|`|mMxfVTSHaa	No. I'm 16 and I don't have one.  Plus, there are some 13 yr olds who don't have cell phones.|`|ls6esy9laa	Yes!  Get a texting plan ,  I'm the same way  I can spend like  50 bucks on texting if my parents don't limit me x]|`|UuPO1Gqzaa	well does he go alot of places, if so you should because you will want to be able to contact him i want a phone but my dad says hes not getting me one until i can pay 4 mins which i can understand because my dad wants for me to learn to be independent. but i do go alot of places and it would be a nice convenience,and plus i would be able to text my friends :)  and me and my friend would have froze tod death if we didn't have one once because we were stuck out side the mall and we wernt with our parents and the securedy gaurd wouldn't let us back in!!! because we didn't have our parents!!!! it was so stupid and i didn't have my jacket! but lucky my friend had her cellphone so we called her dad and bla bla sorry im rambling on and on so its your choice.|`|3SYFCDsfaa	He should get one. I'm 13. I'd say 90% of people in my grade have them. It's also important because as a 13 year old, I go out with my friends a lot without adults, and it's important to be able contact your parents.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Only if he wants to call you or his 13 year old girlfriend.|`|a98nJlnEaa	i dont feel a 13 year old needs a cell phone unless he has after school activities that you arent there for or something along that line.. my parents bought my brother a cell phone (10 years old) which i think is a TOTAL waste because he NEVER goes anywhere without them except for school... he doesnt talk to anyone on his cell or the house phone... when i turned 13 i just got a pager.. :-D|`|8Lskv2QWaa	ABSOLUTELY YESSSSSS!!!!! with unlimited texting! thats just what a kid needs
2irmTjQ3aa	why do u change the condom in between?? Thats weird. U really need to learn about things you are very immature, learn how to protect yourself properly.|`|AkHwZV0yaa	do you know how a girl even gets pregnant.if he didn't *** inside of you then it's kind of impossible.if your really that scared then take a home pregnancy test.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	i bout it and there is no need to change the condom half way through its silly|`|VN8kBnuRaa	It doesn' sound like it, have you been under stress or anything?? Stress can have a major impact on your period!|`|kkXc4hAIaa	i dont think so take a test in 2 weeks|`|nluNSDI4aa	No you are not pregnant. in order for you to get pregnant he would have had to ejaculated in you or pre- ejaculation. The condom did'nt break and yall kept switching condoms? im guessing this is for your sake to lesson your worry about the condom breaking. But you are fine. You don't get symptoms that fast sweety. Take a sex ed. class|`|2efUNOEEaa	maybe go see a doctor girl|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	You are probably just stressed out. Go to the nearest Planned Parenthood clinic and ask to speak to a counselor. They will discuss some better options with you.

382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	I had to have an MRI 2 weeks ago and was asked if there was even a chance I could be pregnant. MRI's are not recommended in pregnancy, so I would be ringing the hospital and putting it off for a few weeks until you know for sure. However, if it is urgent, discuss it with your Dr.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Inform your doctor and ask him.|`|MkCTwE95aa	this is a tough one. I would do it now though. I will probably get thumbs down but an mri at less than a week pregnant probably wouldnt harm the baby and if it is important to your health then you shouldnt wait for 9 months. I know its not the same thing but i had dental xrays done when i was 6 weeks pregnant because i didnt know i was, my midwife said many women dont know they are pregnant for the first month anyways and for the most part anything you do in that time wont harm your baby.     Im sure the doctors performing the scan will be able to better answer this questions though.

SEzIkGNiaa	Babysitting is a great way to make money!  Start out by handing flyers to people/neighbors you know with children.  On the flyer, put:    *Name  *Age  *Number or E-mail  *Rates  *Experiences  *Availability/Flexibility    If babysitting doesn't work out, you could always try:    Being a bus boy at a fastfood restaurant  Yard Work  Bake Sales/Lemonade Stands (funner with friends too!)  Paper Route  Garage Sales  Cleaning houses    Good Luck!
kv8ZFPP1aa	i would take another test just to be sure...|`|67QVKHQ3aa	the only way to know is to take another test, but it dies sound like a yes to me!|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Never use results you got after 10 minutes; they could just be evaporation lines. You need to test again to know for sure.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Try taking a pregnant not pregnant kind of test because the line one are not valid after the time frame they give you and 10 minutes its definately passed so take another one.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Tests are void after 10 minutes; take another one, your reading is not accurate.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If the test showed nothing after 10 minutes, it was defective.  Take another test.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i would re-test.|`|v3LnJycKaa	you can not rely on a pregnancy test that has sat for longer than 10 minutes, you should take another first thing in the morning, I have always taken mine in the evening because once i buy it i cant really wait ;) but some women dont get accurate results unless they use fmu (first morning urine)|`|JQcIwPXJaa	If nothing shows between 2 and 10 minutes then the test is defective and any result could be wrong. Get another test and test today. It's best to get a box of three to make sure. Best Wishes!|`|VKd2vs2Taa	buy a digital one if you can afford it ,if not buy a 3 pack and use the very 1st pee of the morning. good luck. walmart has the tests at a good price.|`|n3IoftMFaa	It means you should actually be married before having a baby. You should never say "Me and my boyfriend are trying for a baby".|`|iwYu32N2aa	I wouldnt go by it. Your not supposed to read a test after 10 minutes. Buy another one and test. Good Luck|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Take another one :) clear blue digital would be the best.. easier to read, and it gives your better results...:) <br>  <br>  39 weeks and 5 days!!!!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Take another test to be sure.|`|bTlhBX3daa	The chances of the 2nd line showing up if you are not pregnant are slim. BUT....you can't trust a test that sat for that long. You can only trust the results that show within the alotted timeframe per the instructions (usually about 10 minutes), because sometimes evaporation lines can appear. <br>  <br>  I would take another test. Make sure you take it with your first urination of the morning as that is when HCG hormone levels will be highest and the test is most likely to be accurate. I personally recommend a digital test (like ClearBlue Easy Digital) because some of the +/- or line tests can get confusing sometimes, but other people don't like the digital tests because they are pickier about the levels of HCG.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can try is urinating in a cup and dipping the tester, most test will have instructions for how long to leave the tester in the cup, etc. I prefer this method because it's less messy and there's no chance of missing the part you need to urinate on.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|WMHu243caa	Keep taking tests and if u receive more double lines then single get ur *** to the doctor and take a blood test.

ACc1skbPaa	It depends...for me they felt like very bad menstrual cramps at the beginning of labor and then as I progressed it felt like a very tight literal "contraction" of the muscles in your abdomen--it's actually your uterus contracting but your stomach will be very hard and tight and it can hurt...a sharp pain once in a while at 34weeks is probably just stretching of your uterus as you accomodate the baby or the baby moving and catching you unaware...Braxton Hicks Contractions are the tightening you experience without the pain...at any rate, ask your OB either at your next visit or in a phone call--that is what they are there for and what they want you to ask them about...if the pains are withing 5 minutes of each other and coming in a regular pattern (or even if they are 10-15 min. apart) then call the OB asap, but don't worry--you'll know when you are in labor, trust me...|`|hAXJ47iAaa	You will feel your belly tighten up like someone is pulling a belt really tight around you...and it will gradually increase in intensity then subside.

It's a tightening feeling in your uterus. You might be having some Braxton-Hicks contractions,  it's just your uterus getting ready.  I had a lot of pressure on my bladder and felt like I was gonna wet my pants when I had a contraction.|`|1uRUaSblaa	I had the caesarean op.days before the actual birthdate of my daughter so I did not experience any contractions but I was told they feel like very severe menstrual cramps.|`|AA11987492	You know those cramps you get on your period that put you in the floor crying like a little girl?

My whole belly hurt really bad. You stomach feels like its getting really tight.
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It is rare that ectopics happen, but they do. Sometimes they can give the same symptoms as a uterine pregnancy. My advice is to stop reading all about ectopic pregnancies on the internet. :) It will only scare you. Most of the time when women have a tubal pregnancy they are in excruciating pain and have bleeding before they even know they are pregnant. My sister in law, just thought she was on her period and cramping. Then it got so bad she went to the ER and they told her that her tube had ruptured. She had to be rushed into surgery. Just keep an eye on your body. If you start to have bleeding, abdominal pain, pain in the shoulder or fainting, then you should call your Dr or go to the ER. Keep in mind that some women have some spotting and cramping in early pregnancy. As far as the peeing goes...Yes, you may still have that. During pregnancy, hormones cause the kidneys and the body's filtration system to start working overtime, which creates more urine. Later in pregnancy it is also your uterus pressing on the bladder that causes you to have to pee so much.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i believe so, but its usually very very painful, not like normal pregnancy..thats a very dangerous thing you should go to the doctor right away and get it checked out!|`|T8ksKCWCaa	At first, all signs/ symptoms will be the same.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	You would be feeling a lot of pain unrelated to a normal pregnancy. Also, if your midwife/OB does blood work the hormone levels would be off the charts and show them something was wrong.|`|427880af15b27fb711e86ef110b31dddaa	yes you can but you will start being in so much pain if you think you have a tubal pregnancy get to the doctor because you could die from it  if your tub breaks,or you may never get pregnant again if that happens|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well idk i guess you would, callk ur obgyn or go see himor her. this kind of pregancy can  be harmful. good luck|`|ttrA4TiRaa	everything is the same until your doc tells your at your first ultrasound that its a tubal
Coc593Ikaa	Yes, you are being a bit too optimistic, not that there is anything wrong with that.<br>  <br>  But here is the reality: 50% of TTC couples will succeed in 6 months, while 95% will succeed in a year.<br>  <br>  So, while some women do get their positive result on the first month of trying, most women do not.<br>  <br>  ADD: My doctor recommended waiting 3 months after quitting the pill to concieve. She told me it takes that long for the uterine lining to build back up appropriately. But she also said that if we did get pregnant within those 3 months that it was not a big deal.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	when you have been on the pill for a long time it takes no less then 3 months for your body to get back on track, meaning you are not really fertile yet, so wait another 2 months and then you have every reason in the world to be optimistic..Good luck!!|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	It may take a while for the birth control to leave your system after taking it for so long.

Just don't get your hopes up too high.|`|253d24bac898f8788a0685a163cdb5d9aa	Nature will take it's course :-) I was on both sets of pills for about 10 years then got pregnant within a few months.

q1Swxe3qaa	I agree with the fact that you should both wait a little while before mentioning a shower so that the risk of miscarriage for both of you is out of the questions. You said that she is your best friend. If my best friend was having a baby, whether I was pregnant or now, I would still want to throw her a shower! It's her first kid! Shes your best friend! It's something very special!!! If you guys are that close, you can always do your showers together! That would be fun too! Although baby showers can get expensive, you can make it so they're not. You can ask the guests to bring a dish to pass. you or someone you know can make the cake instead of spending a fortune on having a pro make it. Stick to punch and water or juice. My friends got all the decorations for my shower on sale! Go down the clearance section at Walmart! They always have stuff down there. You don't have to go all out!|`|Coc593Ikaa	Toss her the shower. The only really valid reason I saw on your list not to is expense. You don't have to spend a lot of money on it. You can stick to tea (sweet and un) and cookies/chips. That won't cost much at all for a small group. And set up will not be a big deal at all unless you end up on bedrest. We pregnant women have our challenges, but we can handle more than we are given credit for. As for the miscarriage fear, please don't let fear ever rule your life; proceed as if all will be well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ADD: The joint shower sounds a bit off to me. If you do this it will be the two of you tossing a shower for the two of you. Yes, technically you could say you did hers and vice versa, but really you would be throwing your own party. It sounds on the tacky side to me. But I do like the potluck idea!|`|OWReYgV5aa	I've never heard of it being wrong for a family member to throw the shower...my aunt threw my first one and if I have one this time, it will be a family member throwing it, which is how the only ones I've ever been to have been done.  So I wouldn't worry about that.  <br>  You have to take your ego out of the picture, wouldn't you hate to know that you were being thrown a party out of pity or selfishness??  I hope that doesn't sound rude, but if you aren't giving her one just because you want to make your friend happy, then maybe you SHOULD let her mother in law take over.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Ok first of all, who ever said that family can't throw showers for family? That's what we do in our family. But to answer your question, yes I think you should throw her a shower. Like you, I love to entertain. When I realized no one was throwing my friend a shower, I took it upon myself to throw her a shower. You can keep it very simple and your husband won't have to do much besides maybe hanging a banner. Here's some tips: <br>  1.Buy your balloons from the dollar store and blow them up yourself. If you have children in your family, ask them to help you.<br>  2.Koolaid and pineapple juice makes great punch. Make a regular pitcher of koolaid and just add a large can of pineapple juice.<br>  3. Have chips and dip and make cute little finger sandwiches. Just buy a loaf or regular bread, cheese, turkey, ham, and lettuce and cut the sandwiches in 4's. Instead of buying a cake, make cupcakes with pink or blue frosting (depending on what she's having).|`|ARUVea4yaa	i would say do a joint part where you are throwing it for her and she is for you, ad both be hostess and both pay for food and everything, that way you can do it all in one shot seeing that you will both be due within a month or so of each other - but i mean you have a few months to plan it all|`|HrDcaocMaa	I agree that you should wait until after you're 3 months along to rule out the miscarriage risk... But if you sort of want to throw her a party - what I would do is have it at a park ( all you will need to do is decorate picnic tables with tablecloths that you get at the $1 store...  hubby won't really need to do anything and YOUR house will remain clean!) and instead of mailing out invitations I would send Evites - no fees for stamps!  And also, I would make this a Buffett event in which everybody can plan on bringing a dish or dessert - drinks - paper goods etc...  and as far as gifts go - I think in today's economy it is very selfish to do a baby registry ANYWHERE...  everybody knows the basics of what a newborn baby needs and to hand out a list with $100-$300 brand name strollers and other "material" non-sense is just a real bad decision...  I'm actually in this predictament right now - all these lavish gift registries with crap a baby doesn't need right when it pops out is very unpractical... and I have 2 of my own and always felt that doing a registry was so selfish and thoughtless of others... but that's my opinion!  I hope you enjoy your new baby to be - and please stop worrying about Mary - you need to concentrate on keeping healthy and relaxed for you own sake!!!  ?|`|OuuYoSBeaa	well first of all, its normal to have some jelous if someone else falls pregnant right away when you have been trying, but in the end you have to put those feelings aside. its not there fault it happened right away and its not your fault it didnt for you...Second, if money is tight right now, and you are not planning this untill summer, then start putting 20 or 30 dollars a month aside right now.. They dont have to be expensive. Finger foods and some 2liters of pop or juice, a few ballons and streamers if you wish from the dollar store. You can ask close family to bring a dish aswell to help out. Your husband does not have to like it, he isnt going to be there anyways but as a husband he can help you set up tables or chairs and put a damn smile on his face while he helps, then he can bugger off with his friends for a few hours. I think if you want to throw her a shower and she is a friend before family, then its a nice gesture, and not because she will throw you one later, but becuase its something that you want to do.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i dont think a joint one is the best idea. hormones are raging and there is going to be jelousy.. oh they got her a swing and not me, her clothes are nicer then mine, she got more presesnts... do it seperately|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Yes definately! Human nature is extremely infactuized with their offspring and Im sure she would greatly appreciate it if someone did something as such for her.  The social gathering itself is a great thing to do and it wont hurt for people to know how fit you would be for your actions toward an event as such.  It just shows how much you care and the measures of your being for family.  Have fun!|`|robYLjhTaa	wait to your both past the danger zones - throw a joint shower.<br>  <br>  she is your best friend and also family, this should be a happy time you and your best friend can enjoy your pregancies together and due almost the same time, your little ones will be so close!!!<br>  <br>  congrats by the way xxxxxxx|`|xTcIshYvaa	The two of you could have a double baby shower. that would save money and time. plus you both with have guests in common anyways. You should try to find someone else's house to have the party or rent a fire hall. That way there will be no resentment towards the mom who does get to have it in her home.<br>  I hope you have a beautiful, healthy baby! God bless you and good luck!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I would wait until you and Mary are a little farther along so the risk of miscarriage has decreased and then bring up the idea of a baby shower.  I think you should throw it for her.  You could make it a potluck event and have the guests each bring a dish so you wouldn't have to provide all the food and drinks.  Another idea is a joint baby shower since your due dates are so close to each other and a lot of the guests would be the same.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	Baby showers don't have to be expensive. You can ask a few close friends that will be invited to help supply the drinks and you can make a cake for under $10. Showers don't typically last long enough to need to offer food and if you have it around 2 in the afternoon it will start just after lunch and end before dinner. I am sure that you don't need to waste money in decorations either as everyone knows how tight money is these days and your friend would much rather have the gifts than food and decor. <br>  I just threw a shower and sent out an evite so I didn't have to waste money on invitations and stamps.<br>  I know that thinking about miscarrying is hard now, but I'm sure you wouldn't want her to go through that either and so you can just be happy for her. My cousin and close friend both got pregnant the same time I did when I had miscarriages and it's hard. It's hard to go to their showers knowing that I should be having a baby soon. But the day isn't about you it's a way to bless them and show your support and love. Best Wishes.
3oSQQt6maa	My son is the same way, he always cries at daycare, but when i leave he is happy. i think it is cause they are so use to us. The more he goes the better it will be.

An Evenflo stroller is only going to fit an Evenflo seat.<br>  <br>  A Baby Trend sit 'n stand might work, if the older child is 2 and up. It accommodates most brands of seats.

I did the same thing as you. I pumped for my daughter while she was in the NICU, and tried breastfeeding her, but she just wouldn't cooperate. I had PPD, I think too, and every day I wish that I would have stuck with it a lot longer than I did. I get crap for formula feeding too. I posted a response to someone before over formula feeding and all I said was that we should just worry about our own children and be glad that all of the mothers on here feed their children, and I got so many thumbs down. I couldn't believe it. I think all these women are on some sort of kick where they need a self esteem boost or something. It is just ridiculous.

Most people on here just want what you want. It discourages me to though ~ seeing all these rude comments and wondering if people think I am like this one or that one because I advocate breastfeeding. That being said, I am nothing like the Fajina's of this section and will not tolerate being called names. I advocate, I don't insult and I do not judge. My saving grace and the reason I keep coming back to this soap opera is my friends. I've met more people on here that are passionate about the same things I am than I have in "real" life.

There is no reason for people to be as nasty, vicious, malicious, and immature as they act on this board. As for the whole breastfeeding vs formula debate, that just irritates me. There's SO much worse than formula feeding in my opinion. It's not even a question. Formula is not wrong in any which way. Anyways, I'm getting off topic.

It's very common and affects 10-15% of mothers, and of course this board is made up of mostly mothers. Some days I really wish I hadn't discovered Y!A as these kind of judgemental, rude, idiotic people really do sometimes get to me and I wish I could just let it go over my head! I have been judged for breastfeeding, and for formula feeding. I had someone tell me I should be using reusable nappies when I asked about own brand nappies (even though I do use reusables during the day) and I was even judged and called a 'cheapskate' for using reusables! I'v been disgraced for not being married when I had my first child (although we have since married), and even once judged because I said I iron all my kids' outer clothing (apparantly I obviously don't spend enough time with my kids as i'm too busy ironing). Oh, and I'm teaching my kids that it's ok to financially depend on someone else because I'm a stay-at-home mum, but I'm sure the minute I mention going back to work, someone will tell me that I'm selfish for not devoting all my time to my children.<br>  But my contacts (you all know who you are) and even some that aren't on my contacts list, are the people that make it worth it. They're the ones who offer genuine, informative and non-judgemental advice. I really need to learn to ignore the others, but it's not that easy.<br>  I don't understand how these people can live with themselves - what if one of their comments was enough to push a mother with severe PPD over the edge? We don't know or understand everyone's circumstances on here, so we are not in a position to judge.<br>  'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone'.|`|KDb96QS7aa	Wow. I'm glad you posted this.

There are some down right nasty people on here. I love Y!A for the most part. You are right I love coming on here for support - I have made some friends on here and gotten a lot of helpful answers to questions.  But the last few days I have seen more and more nasty posts that really make me feel bad.  I know I should just ignore them and I guess I do becuase I don't feed their hate by answering their questions, but none the less they can be very hurtful (ESPECIALLY when it comes to breastfeeding issues!!) I was and have been very depressed because I have been unable to breastfeed my twins. I have had low supply with all of my children and the twins were no different. I have felt especially bad because this will be my last opportunity to do so and I can't. I know feeding formula they will be just fine - my others were, but I still feel like a failure sometimes or that I didn't try hard enough. Then reading some of the posts validates this feeling and these people I am sure intend it too.  They do not take into consideration that some have issues beyond their control that makes breastfeeding impossible.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I sent you some posts on facebook - Man oh man, this has been a FUN night!<br>  It really is starting to turn into a circus, I mean really - it sucks the big one when people can't voice an opinion without ending up with threatening emails and awful answers, thumbs down for great answers, it's just stupid. And then the language from Veronica... It's stupid! I hope things start going back to normal soon!|`|f4HsyUfQaa	You could do like a lot of YA! people and make your contact info private. I had a poster on here leave me a nasty email when I first posted a question about celiac disease and pregnancy. Just iggy the twits, and do what's best for your family. Remember this.. Happy Mom=Happy Baby!|`|heDtLdz5aa	i think it is horrible that this immaturity goes on here..i am sorry you have been dealing with drama over the internet...i don't know why people feel the need to be so hurtful to other people..this is a place where i thought i could ak for support or give support..i am going to continue doing so, and try to just ignore the stupid trolls on here..there are way too many nice people on here that use this for the right reasons..don't let random people get to you..it isn't worth it..hope this helps : )|`|pXSKSS3daa	She's crazy! Remember she had it in for us awhile back. Gosh, she's at it again?<br>  <br>  Hon, you're a great mommy. Forget her, she's really not worth the time. I've had my fair share of rude comments towards me on here but I let it slide off my back. I know great users on here so I'd rather "spend time" chatting with them and answering their questions than dwelling on the rude ones that obviously have nothing better to do than harrass others.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure she isn't even a mother.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I'm not one of your contacts, but I completely agree.  I just don't get the hatred, when the topic is Newborn and Baby!  Where the heck does hatred come into play, with anything that has to do with newborn and baby.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I totally know what you are saying. Some people are absolutely nuts. I find it amazing that there are so many people out there with nothing better to do...|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I was just diagnosed yesterday with PPD. I'm actually surprised about it but it all makes sense. I'm not severe but you never know what could trigger someone's depression or stress to get worse. I try not to read in to some of these people on here too much, but sometimes you can't help but to take certain things a little personally or they may hit close to home.<br>  <br>  I breastfeed and pump at work. I don't know what all the fuss about that is. Modern technology and "convenience" has taken over. That's why we have toilet paper and bottles. If we weren't such a fast paced world we would all be using corn cobs to wipe our butts and every mother would have baby to breast. And if she couldn't do it, her neighbor probably would.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel, though. I guess somewhere along the lines I answered a question in the Religious and Spirituality section. Some psycho names "Sophia" who also hangs out in here must have followed me over that night. Well, a couple of weeks ago I was having a really hard time with my daughter and I asked a question about her being a high needs baby. this chick sent me an email message calling me a bible beater b**ch with a special needs kid. How awful. I just stared at the monitor trying to think of how someone could be so hateful. I couldn't even imagine typing something so awful to someone! <br>  <br>  You NEVER know what's going on in their mind and if they are in a fragile state. I did the right thing and didn't reply although she sent me another email about another question I asked later but that's the last I've heard from her. <br>  <br>  I come here for dupport and to do my best to support others! Sure, I like to have fun with some questions, but I never disrespect anyone or condemn their choices. Advice and support is my goal. I give it, and only hope to receive it.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	I feel really bad for you.  I saw both of those questions and I think that last person who posted that question is the same person who wrote that message to hunters mommy.  <br>  <br>  Don't get down about it.  There are plenty of mommies that are here just to support each other...at least I know that's what I am here for.  And then there are others who are just so miserable in there own lives that they want others to be miserable w/them.  Don't fall into the trap!  Just stay positive and stay away from the drama as much as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  best wishes.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Oh yeah. I read that question about "She who must not be named" (sorry, been watch harry potter). I am so over being told i am a bad mother and sick of seeing my contacts and others being called bad mothers. Honestly, it makes me wonder whether people are like this in real life. Whether they would walk up to someone in the street and tell them they are a bad mother so formula feeding. (has happened to me). We come here for advice, not to be told that we are bad parents and don't deserve to have children. <br>  I am the same Becks, It still hurts that i couldn't breastfeed Isabella after my operation but we are all doing the best we can and we all love a children.
wBpennsMaa	Congrats hun! As long as you tried waking him its fine that he didn't take it. All you can do is try and its important for them to sleep as well as eat. Your milk will come in the next couple days. Mine came in the fourth day post partum. I went from painful nipples to painful engorged breasts. The engorgement only lasts a couple days. Your body makes the perfect amount and perfect blend of milk for your baby. I am 13 days post partum and breastfeeding is going amazingly well. At first during pregnancy I said I would give myself two weeks and if it still hurt I would quit because it wouldn't be worth the pain...thankfully it doesn't hurt much anymore but I decided later in pregnancy that I would do everything to make it work because of the health benefits. Don't you love it when they sleep so you can freshen up!? Congrats and Good luck! Can't wait to hear more from you!|`|qtCVLDFxaa	During the first few days, its important for babies to feed regularly. I would let him go and see how long he sleeps before feeding again. But not more than four hours because he is still very young. At this age, babies who don't eat enough get sleepy, then don't eat because they're asleep etc... Soon he will be bigger and stronger and you won't have this worry,  you can just feed him on demand.<br>  <br>  At 2 days, you still don't have real milk, just colustrum, so it's normal for feedings to be shorter (Colustrum is real thick and rich, and there isn't much of it....) <br>  <br>  As for helping with the sleepiness, what worked best with my daughter was feeding her in her onesie until she fell asleep on one side. Then taking her to change her diaper, where she would wake up (screaming bloody murder...). After, I offered the other breast until she was asleep again or turned away. This is called demand feeding and insures your baby gets all the rich hind-milk.<br>  <br>  You can't really tell by the time he spends at the breast if he feeds enough. Some babies are real effective nursers, and others like to cuddle and take their time. You have to count nappies, check if he seems satisfied etc instead of the time.<br>  <br>  Try to get some rest too, those first few weeks of adjusting are the hardest !! The site below has a lot of good info.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	Mine did that as well,i just let him sleep at first.  but then he was always sleeping.  What i started doing was to feed him first and keep trying to keep him awake.  and when i couldn't keep him awake anymore, i would go change his diaper, with a cold wipe right out of the container. and then feed him some more after since that would wake him again.  after awhile i started waking him every 2 hours during the day because he was having reflux issues and i wanted to cut down on the amount he was eating at once but not the amount for the day.  and what i found was he started being more awake during the day and sleeping longer at night.  still spitting up but not as often.|`|YVasdve0aa	I was told that this was fine as long as it was at least ten minutes.  If it is less they told me to stroke the bottom of his foot or unwrap him.  The tickle or cold would wake him.  Your milk probably isn't in yet anyway.  He is basically getting colostrum which is pretty fatty and filling from what I've been told.  I would let him sleep.  I was also told to wake him every 2 hours to feed, but I struggle with this one too.|`|vCWVimTzaa	thats fine. Let him choose when a feeding starts and stops. If he is sooo sleepy he wont nurse but for a minute or two, you would need to rouse him, but 10 min is a good feed. He just might be a very efficient nurser. My son hardly ever nurses for longer than 10 min. Just count his wet and dirty diapers. as long as he is having plenty of each you know its getting in there and there is nothing to worry about.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	For the first 2 weeks he should nurse 10-12 times in a 24 hour period. Since your milk isn't in yet 10 minutes of colostrum is good. Colostrum is thick and fills baby's up fast. He is good until his next feeding which should be about 2 hours away. Quick get a nap in.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	I just wanted to say Congratulations!! He's a cutie!!!<br>  <br>  BTW....Let that baby sleep!!|`|tMxGi4hPaa	Just let him sleep till he's hungry again. He'll be fine. Babies will sleep A LOT for another week or so now.|`|CScyedcwaa	yes let him sleep... babies are humans just like u and i remember that they know when they are hungry and he will let you know by CRYING.  right now he's tired after the labor so he'll eat and sleep for the next two weeks enjoy it because after that he'll have you going in circles. again let him sleep right now he's working with his instincts  and that's the best monitor if you feed him and he's not hungry he'll vomit and That could be dangerous. congratulations your life has just began|`|mZ5BaBguaa	yes its fine he'll defo let you know when he is hungry they always do but just to let u know demand feeding is exausting but its the best i think i found it hard cuz i have a toodler to|`|u6jP7BQNaa	When he gets hungry he'll wake up.  Most babies don't want much to eat the first couple of days.  Let him rest, and try to get some yourself.  Congratulations by the way.|`|iQcd37Goaa	he's too young he'll sleep a lot so just let him sleep and he'll wake up when he's hungry my baby was just like that..PLEASE DON'T PINCH YOUR BABYS NOSE!!|`|AA11089301	omg pinch his nose? hum no......rub or walk your fingers up his spine....it tickles so he will wake up, but i would wait til next feeding to do so if need be.|`|XXbFFVg8aa	At this point, let HIM be your guide. Let him eat and sleep when he pleases until he is actually able to get on a routine!|`|n3FfpRqCaa	Yes, I did when my baby was 2 days old|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	since your milk isnt even in yet (mine took 5 days, btw) I wouldnt let him sleep longer than 3 hours without nursing. my baby would only go about 30 minutes-2 hours until my milk came in. thank God for co-sleeping!!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes <br>  demand feed and you will never have any problems <br>  and just let him sleep it is the sleepy week<br>  and dont wake him to eat he will wake when he is hungry and let u no when he is hungry|`|tbeO3Lataa	Oh my god, hon! You're home! He is beautiful, Ashley, really.<br>  <br>  Yes, just let him sleep, and he'll let you know when he is hungry. Take advantage of this time to fall asleep yourself!|`|JMI40MHpaa	don't let him be comfortable take off his hat and socks.. stuff that keeps him all bundled and warm ... rub his feet  or his cheek while  hes eating and switch up when he starts to doze off <br>  when hes older he'll stay up allot longer|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Let sleeping babes lie!  If your other breast is full and uncomfortable then you can express the milk with a pump or manually, but I'd let the baby sleep.  My daughter only fed on every other breast at every other feeding too!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	wake him around midnight. my doctor told me not to let him go over 3 hours when he was that young.
mjz8JF9Gaa	i had pizza rolls and a ham sandwich <br>  my son was also in a clingy mood <br>  and for desert i had a bowl of frosted flakes <br>  <br>  ahhh im soo bad at eating <br>  <br>  <br>  but healthy choice, weight watchers, smart ones frozen dinners or something <br>  or samdwiches on whole wheat bread|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's 9PM and dinner is in the oven.

I guess we got a special treat tonight.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	We had broiled salmon, roasted potatoes, and a salad. Salmon is a super easy, really healthy way to go!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	We had "green pasta" tonight-that's what my kids call it :))<br>  It's pasta- rotini-with pesto sauce! A favourite in the house! And to add a little salad of baby tomatoes with mushrooms and some goat's cheese :) My son loves goat's cheese! <br>  It's actually not hard at all-it's pasta you know the ritual-then pesto sauce -bought from the store- so once the pasta is done mix and match! <br>  the tomatoes and mushrooms are not the traditional but great at home. Eveyrbody loves tomatoes :) But you can make your own side veggies, we try to place veggies on the side to everything! baby carrots, tomatoes, etc...<br>  And if your husband can make Mac n Cheese he can make other kinds of pasta... not the healthiest but beats Mc Donalds or cheetos ;)<br>  Next time you go to the store, stack up on items you can put together quickly and make a meal. <br>  For example buy diff kinds of pasta-multigrain preferably-and some yummy sauce.<br>  Lipton's side kicks rice is amazing!! As a sidedish to any kind of chicken or beef... also ground beef is a must! You can add it to the pasta, or can make burgers out of it.<br>  You can also get some chicken breasts and some seasoning, so when in a hurry or tired, or the baby isnt feeling great, just defrost the chicken in the microwave, season and place it in the oven. It doesnt take a whole lot of preparation.<br>  Also buy frozen veggies! so you dont have to chop :)) But at least you can have some veggies with your meals...<br>  You can also buy pizza crust and make home made pizza... not too fast but not bad :)) My kids loove helping make it!! <br>  And I do include veggies in there ;)<br>  <br>  hope I helped!!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I keep track of calories, I don't pay too much attention to anything else.  <br>  <br>  How about turkey breast (90 calories), lettuce and tomato (5 calories) in a pita (80 calories), with a side of cottage cheese (90 calories), and a couple of chocolate drizzle rice cakes (100 calories)?

I cut up some potatoes, put onions and mushrooms on them, and layed some chicken on top. Then I covered them in rosemary, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper, poured broth in the pan and let it bake on 175 for 1 hr 45 min (covered in foil) then took the foil off and broiled for 10 min. to crisp the skin up. : )|`|yCwPxulYaa	My husband and I had grilled chicken, Steamed Carrots, Corn, and stuffing.<br>  <br>  My daughter who is six months, had some of the steamed carrots and some mommy juice. <br>  <br>  Sadly though, I didn't cook this, we ate at church.

Also laying your baby down, even tho your son may cry, won't hurt him while you make yourself something more healthier than chips.

I made chicken pot pie tonight. Casseroles are easy to throw together and pop in the oven, but aren't always the healthiest. A grilled protein (like fish or chicken) served with a carb (like potatoes, rice, etc.) and lot's of veggies always makes a healthy, balanced meal.<br>  I made this the other night and it came out well. It's like a thai pasta:<br>  1. 3 tablespoons soy sauce<br>  2. 2 tablespoons lime juice<br>  3. 1 tablespoon cooking oil, plus<br>  4. 1 tablespoon cooking oil, if needed<br>  5. 4 cloves garlic, minced<br>  6. 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br>  7. 3 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br>  8. 1 teaspoon soy sauce<br>  9. 2 teaspoons lime juice<br>  10. 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter, preferably natural<br>  11. 1 cup canned low-sodium chicken broth or homemade stock<br>  12. 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>  13. 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  14. 1/8 teaspoon dried red-pepper flakes, or to taste<br>  15. 3/4 pound spaghetti<br>  16. 3 scallions including green tops, chopped<br>  17. 1/3 cup chopped peanuts (optional)<br>  2. Cooking Directions<br>  1. In a medium, shallow glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine the 3 tablespoons soy sauce, the 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon of the oil, the garlic, and the ginger. Add the chicken; turn to coat. Let marinate at least 10 minutes.<br>  2. Meanwhile, in a medium, stainless-steel saucepan, combine the remaining 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 2 teaspoons lime juice, the peanut butter, broth, sugar, salt, and red-pepper flakes. Pour the marinade from the chicken into the saucepan and bring just to a simmer over moderate heat, whisking until smooth.<br>  3. Heat a grill pan over moderate heat. Cook the chicken until browned and just done, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes. Cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Alternatively, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy frying pan. Cook and slice the chicken in the same way.<br>  4. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghetti until just done, about 12 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss with the peanut sauce, chicken, and scallions. Top with the chopped peanuts, if using.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Frozen bags of veggies, you can get them in those steam bags and just pop them in your microwave. Very easy, especially when you're busy and can't cook.

q4JMjvGLaa	I found out I was pregnant when I was 4 weeks 3 days pregnant and my expected period was right on the day I turned four weeks. The day that I expected my period I had severe cramps and I thought my period was going to be very painful that month. I cramped a few days later and I thought that maybe I should take a test? I took a test from Dollar Tree and it was POSITIVE! And I experienced cramps for weeks after that. Everything is fine though, the cramps are a combination of your uterus accomodating the new pregnancy and your ligaments preparing to stretch. GOD BLESS YOU!|`|tWbRxqkuaa	well after me and my bf had the sex, i was fine for about 3-4 weeks as well and had cramps and went to the doc and he said the babies kicking your vagina or somewhere incomfortable that the guys penis was in.if this continues, you need to go to the doc IMEDDIATELY..mayb it could be your and the babys daddys blood not mixing...|`|jztRcFT8aa	yes this is completely normal. Most people who don't know they're pregnant yet tend to think they're about to get their period because of the cramping. You're just fine. Good luck with the pregnancy and congratulations!!|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	Yep verry normal I' have 2 kids and 5 other pregnancys that wher misscariages|`|V5gJ2OwYaa	not sure, ask your pedeatrician|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes that's pretty normal. It's your uterus growing and stretching to accomidate baby. That's normal.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, that is completely normal. A lot of women, including myself, get menstrual-like cramps early on in pregnancy. As long as they are not really severe and/or accompanied by bleeding, there isn't need for concern. And the nausea is normal too unfortunately! That will probably stick around for awhile! Congrats to you! :]|`|56MmKc5caa	Yes this is perfectly normal as long as there is no bleeding and not severe cramping pains. I have been feeling mild cramping and a dull stretching like feeling in my stomach sometimes more then other times I am almost 10 weeks pregnant now and found out when I was 5 weeks and had some cramping start I thought I was getting my period but had a feeling I was a preggo and yay I found out I was. Congratulations to you and if something really worries you always ask your doctor to make sure I did.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Ya, that's exactly how I felt around the same time.  If you conceived Valentines day, then you probably had your period at the very beginning of February.  So, you'd count your pregnancy as 4 weeks and 4 days (IF the 1st day of your lmp was Feb 1st EX.).  You're going to start feeling bloated and you'll have the cramping still which is just your ligaments stretching to make room for baby ;)  Congrats!|`|zXGTDkZmaa	Yup all normal. Your body is preparing itself for the big pregnancy! Congrats. If you start bleeding very heavily or if your cramps get to painful with blood involved go to the doctors asap though!|`|1k6UUC8qaa	yes it was for me all 3 times all the changes going on maybe you should get the book what to expect when you're expecting to shed some light on it all

You will probably see the baby with the heart fluttering. If its too early she will be able to see a sac.

His or her eyes, ears and mouth have begun to form (though they're a little more Discovery Channel "creatures of the sea" documentary than Gerber Baby at this point).<br>  <br>  Other exciting milestones include:<br>  <br>  Your baby's heart is now beating to a regular beat, although it's still too faint to hear.<br>  <br>  His or her arm buds are just beginning to, well, bud. They look like teensy swollen bumps at this point. In a few days, they'll resemble itsy-bitsy flippers.<br>  <br>  Your baby has grown to ? inch long—about the size of one of the chocolate sprinkles on your last cupcake (and your last ice cream cone, and your last sundae and your last giant cookie ... maybe there is something to those rumors about pregnancy cravings!).
oYYcFMDcaa	if you were pregnant you would see any type of line for the positive line, even if it was faint or barley there you are pregnant. It is nearly impossible to have a false positive test. BUT it is possible to have a false negative, so take it again after your period was supposed to start.  I know it's hard to wait.  Mine was negative for a few days before my period and then positive 2 days later.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Just because it's faint doesn't mean it's a false. I would take another one just in case and then have it confirmed by your doc or at planned parenthood, it's free there. G/L!
Osn1xpu6aa	I agree with the first answer, it should be something funny/dramatic that will keep the audience entertained.<br>  <br>  A monologue is basically your thought process. No one wants to hear boring thoughts. AND you can always make it up if you don't think you have any good experiences.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Can you think of anything funny that has happened in the past? This will keep the audience entertained. Maybe an embarrassing moment. If not, do you have any heartfelt experiences that you are willing to share?|`|J0EuyXDtaa	AHA. Something I can help with.<br>  <br>  Monologue: <br>  1. Speech you make to yourself<br>  2. A long utterance by one person (especially one that prevents others from participating in the conversation)<br>  <br>  Basically, a one-person talking thing. You can do it in a way that you are, say: <br>  <br>  <br>  Yelling at an "imaginary person"<br>  Talking to your diary.<br>  Spilling your emotions to a "friend"<br>  Talking to yourself<br>  Talking on the phone<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, you have to make it clear what is happening in your monologue. If you are talking on the phone, and since you can only reply, perhaps repeating what the person on the other end is "saying" though keep it realistic. Of course, if, say, a friend died, you don't just go on the phone in reality: "WHAT? Jeff DIED? at NINE PM? last? NIGHT??"<br>  <br>  Look up examples of monologues. There are a lot of different kinds, so look into it.|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Yeah a monologue is just you standing up in front of an audience, expressing dialogue that you've written. Add elements of humor to it, from past experiences, elements of seriousness, elements of tension. And make sure you act in a "heightened naturalistic" manner. Thats always the best way when acting on stage. So yeah. Just use your past experiences as a guide to writing your monologue. Make it funny, sad, dramatic, all that. You will be fine!!!!
4E2BoVptaa	Here's some things that have worked for me.<br>  <br>  1) Switch types of soaking. First soak your feet in cool water with sea salts for about 15 minutes and then switch to warm water for 15 minutes. Usually You switch this cycle for an hour. It works wonders.<br>  <br>  2) Lay with your feet above your heart. When my feet get really swollen, I prop my legs up before going to bed.. and usually it can definately tell a difference in the morning.<br>  <br>  3) Circulation socks. Some brands call them diabetic socks. I've found that they help push out the extra swelling and help some too.<br>  <br>  4) Drink a TON of water. Water takes down the swelling too.<br>  <br>  These are just thinks that worked for me. Hope that they work for you too.|`|ZcfZx60aaa	If you are on your feet a lot, try to sit down more often:) Also, if you cut a lot of the sodium (salt) out of your diet you won't have as much swelling. You can also massage your feet yourself, or wear tight stalkings (the heigher they come up on your leg the better).<br>  Goodluck!!|`|odMamtlKaa	Read good books, listen to music, watch T.V. and do whatever you want which you could not due to busy schedule.<br>  Do meditation, sketch painting do creative think.<br>  Pain will disappear.<br>  <br>  As far as your question is concerned ask  a doctor / People have already advised.|`|EcQeNu3raa	I usually take a warm bath. That usually does it for me.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You could try soaking them or convincing someone to massage them. Massage is your best bet! :]|`|Yr65nHRkaa	drink a ton of water. it doesn't sound like it will do much, but i promise you it will.
KId2K1G4aa	not too soon to take a test. its very possible you are pregnant. get a test as soon as you can! these are signs of pregnancy.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	probably<br>  if he came inside of you i bet with 100% certainty that you are<br>  you cant have unprotected sex and expect not to be|`|FOG2PeCVaa	It does sound like you could potentially be pregnant. SAFE SEX IS THE BEST SEX!! Just get a pregnancy test and see...Breathe|`|q0Ju2pO2aa	for this your are really stupid<br>  why in the hell would you have unprotected sex idk how many times specially when your a virgin how old are you??<br>  you must be young hopefully you didnt ketch any deseases by this guy in go tell him your pregnant and hope you can support your baby if your a kid then good luck with your parent!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	OF COURSE you could be pregnant! Take a test!|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Theres a very high chance your pregnant. Take a test its not too soon if im reading your dates right. However for the craving food and gaingin weight its far to soon for that, thats just in your head Take a test chances are you probably are|`|fzjePK5Haa	I'm having a hard time understanding when you were expecting your period. But if you missed it you could take a pregnancy test. In the meantime there are early pregnancy symptoms that show up within days of conception. <br>  <br>  I found this website very useful in knowing what to look for. <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recognize-pregnancy-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recogniz...</a>|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	take a deep deep breath and relax hon. then go pick up a test and see what it says when u pee on the stick.<br>  <br>  please, honey, please - for your sake, for your bf's sake: please use protection. condoms can keep you from unwanted pregnancy and from getting sick with some angry disease. you really do need to be careful, and play safely if you must play at all...<br>  <br>  good luck hon|`|kV9YT6bSaa	USE A CONDOM!!|`|fyvTctOyaa	yea probably just wait, go to planned parenthood they will talk to you about it.<br>  <br>  if not, next time use protection!
kaqPSgTVaa	It's not from the cells on your cervix, lol. It's probably just due from your body's Ph balance changing. After you have a baby your body doesn't go back to exactly what it was before you were pregnant. Discharge is very normal and nothing to be concerned about unless it's foul smelling or a darker yellow or green.|`|Ga3eIvPNaa	the discharge you are describing is very normal during pregnancy. there is a name for it and  it starts with an "L" but i can't remember the name. I dont' know about after the birth though but i'm sure it's normal. I dont' remember if it continued on for awhile or not...

r6TijtS8aa	I love Loni, and Lani. Claire is pretty too though. YOu should go by which ever one you want, but Loni Claire would be pretty to go by, just as one "Hi, i'm Loni Claire" they are both very nice names.|`|Elxuvon8aa	If you like the name Loni go with it you can be Claire later in life  I kind of like the Loni|`|bIaywrBCaa	I like it. It is a good way to honor your granddad|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I actually really like that name!  It's cute and fun and unique.  Claire just. . .isn't fun or unique, but it's cute too.<br>  <br>  I used to go to school with a girl named Lani pronounced the same way.

Never worry about something that you can do to make yourself happy.|`|hORVMOHKaa	i know a few guys named Lonnie (pronounced like your name) so it seems like a guy name to me but the name Claire is beautiful|`|pPrwKzLlaa	I think it's very unique.

QxcRUl9haa	I'd do exactly as your parents did. Your 30 but you're still human, everyone gets upset and just needs their parents from time to time. No need to feel ashamed or embarrassed.|`|jztRcFT8aa	Absolutely. It doesn't matter how old your child is, you still want to be a good parent and it re-assures the parent that they're still needed and wanted by their child. It can be a good bonding experience|`|TQ47vny4aa	You better believe it. I would do anything that would make my children feel better and warm inside.|`|AA11097638	I would be very glad that u had come to me. I would have done the same thing as your parents.

When a parent gets pregnant and keeps the child they are basically saying they will raise the person until death. If a person is 1 or 99 they should still deserve the care of a parent when they need it.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Yes I would be liike your Parents.I will always support nd love my Children No matter what age they are!|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	thrown off at first, but i wouldnt mind it|`|MjkDTovqaa	How would I feel?<br>  I would be heartbroken if my daughter didn't feel like she COULD do that if she EVER needed it.<br>  <br>  Robert Munsch<br>  "Love You Forever"<br>  <br>  ...........<br>  <br>  <br>  "The boy grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was a teenager. He had strange friends and he wore strange clothes and he listened to strange music. Sometimes the mother felt like she was in a zoo! <br>  <br>  But at night time, when that teenager was asleep, the mother opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed. If he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. While she rocked him she sang: <br>  <br>  I'll love you forever,<br>  I'll like you for always,<br>  As long as I'm living<br>  my baby you'll be. <br>  <br>  That teenager grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was a grown-up man. He left home and got a house across town. But sometimes on dark nights the mother got into her car and drove across town.  If all the lights in her son's house were out, she opened his bedroom window, crawled across the floor, and looked up over the side of his bed. If that great big man was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rocked him she sang: <br>  <br>  I'll love you forever,<br>  I'll like you for always,<br>  As long as I'm living<br>  my baby you'll be. <br>  <br>  Well, that mother, she got older. She got older and older and older. One day she called up her son and said, "You'd better come see me because I'm very old and sick." So her son came to see her. When he came in the door she tried to sing the song. She sang: <br>  <br>  I'll love you forever,<br>  I'll like you for always... <br>  <br>  But she couldn't finish because she was too old and sick. The son went to his mother. He picked her up and rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And he sang this song: <br>  <br>  I'll love you forever,<br>  I'll like you for always,<br>  As long as I'm living<br>  my Mommy you'll be. <br>  <br>  When the son came home that night, he stood for a long time at the top of the stairs. Then he went into the room where his very new baby daughter was sleeping. He picked her up in his arms and very slowly rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while he rocked her he sang: <br>  <br>  I'll love you forever,<br>  I'll like you for always,<br>  As long as I'm living<br>  my baby you'll be.
2irmTjQ3aa	You can not be sure unless you buy a test. Your chances are not that high, but of course, no matter what, there is always a chance of pregnancy. So you need to buy a test if you miss your period.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	if you used a condom and it didnt break....then you arent pregnant... breast soreness often occurs when you are about to start your period.. stop worrying|`|AA10015577	If you guys used a condom and he didn't ejaculate then you shouldn't be pregnant.

Wa0pHJwMaa	It depends on the woman/girl. We all have different symptoms ranging from bloatedness to bitchiness! Ask your person.|`|ejPPUm4maa	Sure you can if it's a woman's or girls time of the month and their mood changes it is a sure sign not to mention other symptoms! :)|`|bSQTOoKyaa	Yes!

7rCeCVl2aa	The BEST brand of formula is the one that your baby tolerates well.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It all depends on your baby, and what works for them.  I personally like Similac, but that's what works for my baby.  I think the only other one I would try would be Enfamil.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	There isn't one.  They are all essentially the same, with very minor differences that some parents prefer, some don't even notice.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	It is best to ask your pharmacist or doctor. I am in Australia so i used Karicare Gold Step 1 but my daughter developed colic so we went to Nan HA Gold step 1-2. It really depends on the child as to what the best is. They say the more money you pay the better the formula is but i don't think that is the case.<br>  <br>  Don't you just love it when you ask a formula question and some women find it their duty to come and preach about Breast is best.|`|yCwPxulYaa	You will have to try one and see how your baby likes it.  If he/she does not tolerate well, switch to another one.  You can ask your ped. which one they recommend. <br>  <br>  I like Enfamil or Similac.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	what ever one works for baby and does not upset the tummy and does not give gas or reflux|`|UkQuMykiaa	Honestly it depends on which brand you prefer and which one your baby tolerates the best.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	at first my son was one that constipated him... and then it was soy.... he hated that..a nd then we switched him to a lactose free one, and he did really well.

i3pn4jNcaa	if hes getting more and more comfortable with you then i think it will happen if he wants to ask you out. just wait for it.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	You can't make him ask you out. You either have to do it yourself, or become closer, and hope he eventually gets comfortable enough so he can ask you out on a date.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	hang out with him one on one like on the weekend go to the movies or something, I'm sureee he will ask you that way =] good luck!|`|Av9jeRAkaa	why can't you, if you want a relationship with him, be the first to stand up, and ask him out, otherwise, he will probably never ask you out, since yu sad he was shy....don't lose your chance! what difference does it make, if you like him, go for it!!!
VpDhPP8baa	nappy bag holder, tie backs for the curtains, a nursing pillow/cushion.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	definitely a pillow or two.  I would do a wall hanging.  I made one for my baby's room, that had a plastic "pocket" in the center, that I put her picture in.  I'd make a comforter also, that you can use later, when baby gets older.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	pillows are great.  the baby can use them when he/she gets older.  make a little teddy bear.  that would be so cute.  make a canopy for the crib.|`|4NI6QDDuaa	a boppy pillow, one of those boards with ribbons that you put pics on, clothes, pillows, ummmm............................ diaper bag?, sheets?, a blanket?, i don't know what else,....... oh! buy a cheap, plain, photo album, and put fabric over it! i hope i helped.|`|4iXL4C6paa	Maybe use some of the fabric and put around a pic. frame for the babies first pics., or make a pillow and write all of your babies birth info. on it.|`|i6mydMOyaa	Try crib bumpers, a change pad cover, a crib caddy or a pad for your rocking chair!<br>  <br>  I happen to be starting on the same project!

Inc78M0Raa	She just doesn't know what to wear, so she's copying you because she likes your style. I pick out my mom's clothes when we go shopping, or else it's a disaster. Take her copying you as a compliment though. If she hated it, would be be wearing it? I don't think so. You just have good style. :]|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Maybe it's out of jealousy. It may sound weird, but she might be envious of your lifestyle and the things you have.|`|113FoyMFaa	does she say "like" a lot?  that would be your first clue if she's copying you.|`|8iewmkjXaa	dang. she likes ur style alot i guess. thats y ppl usually copy some1 else. and she also sounds jealous. but do something different like with ur phone. go to micheals or a diferent artsy store and buy super glue and small, colorfull rinestones and decorate ur phone. or if u can find a premade one at the mall at claires or something u can buy one of those. and shes jelous coz of wat u say here: she gets mad cause some things i wear dont come in her size and shes like idk how that little fat as* can fit in that [i heard her say that]<br>  <br>  and when she takes my gma shopping she starts screaming at her when she buys me stuff saying how i have 2 parents adn then she goes and buys what i was gona get.<br>  it also makes her mad i shop in this little town by where i live and buy stuff from cute little shops and i dnt tell her about them|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	next time she asks where'd you buy this or that just say "oh i don't think they make these in your size/ for people your age" that should get her to calm down! lol my mom does that to me alllllll the time I recently started buying coach shoes and now you see my mom wearing them too i wore leggings when they started to be in style and she did too i started wearing skinny jeans and now she does too i know exactly how you feel it's soooo annoying! but i tell my mom off she's always trying to wear my stuff I'm 20 she's about to be 37(yes she was prego with me when she was 16). my mom actually shops in the teenager section at the malls you NEVER see her in the adult section. it's even gotten to the point where she tries to copy my make up ughh it's annoying i just try to ignore it for the most part or make little comments on the side though that's pretty much all you could do. good luck hun!|`|umGi6gTcaa	Nothing you really can do. Did she get married or pregnant at a young age? Are her kids practically grown up?<br>  <br>  She probably just wants to be stylish and is trying to recapture her youth. Anything you say to her will just hurt her feelings. Besides the cloths you described don't have an age limit, though most teens dress beyond their years. LOL as long as she isn't wearing baby T's and jellies I would ignore it.<br>  <br>  But if you two are about to go out and you notice she's dressed like you by all means go change if it would embarrasses you to look like "twins". If she asks you can be truthful or lie and say their was a stain on your shirt and you didn't want to go out look like a slob.|`|b4az9Zudaa	you seem very self centered and arrogant. material objects arent the most important thing in the world and i am sure your clothing style isnt as great as you think it is. i say get over yourself and grow up.|`|w2evN22Yaa	Live with it I guess, obviously she admires your style and that's a good feeling in my own opinion.

Sophia Maria rolls off the tongue and is fun to say lol|`|DOG9Vfjmaa	ya it is kinda cool|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	sounds good|`|aNIiGpzeaa	its cute!|`|zwFhrtfJaa	ok what is wrong with your name? i like it, really i do. be proud of ya name at least your name isn't Mummiesha.|`|Elxuvon8aa	your name is great I am not real fond of Sophia but it goes very well together|`|bIaywrBCaa	beautiful. You should be proud to have a lovely name.|`|TNNSHdypaa	You're right, the Sophia Maria part goes together excellently, but the /see/ ending of Kelsey and the /soh/ beginning of Sophia kind of clash.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	It is your name and you should like it. If you prefer, just drop the Sophia and be Kelsey Maria|`|WVqoLROFaa	I think its beautiful!<br>  tdfl|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like your name. It's cute.
qImMwhUHaa	I would pump at work at least two times. The more you pump, the more you'll get. And yes, normally you only get one feeding per pump unless you can increase your milk supply with demand by pumping more frequently. When you feed at home, also pump the other breast...it's a lot of work but it's worth it.|`|OwK17Qo1aa	For trying to store some milk for your son you should try pumping between his feedings so you can get your milk supply up. And if your okay with it try mixing some formula with your breast milk. Like an ounce of formula to breast milk at first so don't hurt his tummy. That way you can add a few ounces into a container in the fridge to freeze at the end of the day. And as for work and pumping you do need to pump as much as you can so your milk supply go low and you can supply him with more breast milk rather than formula. Hope this helps.|`|fzjePK5Haa	I had this trouble too..excpet I worked overnight so you can imagine trying to pump all night and then all day (while I was also trying to sleep). Then reversing it on the weekends...it was a mess. <br>  <br>  I found this site to be very useful in figuring out how and when to pump. <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4661475_breastfeed-after-returning-work.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4661475_breastfe...</a><br>  <br>  Also, if you don't pump for 12 hours you'll be really engorged the first few days, then your milk supply will start to dry up. I found it best to try to pump when I knew my daughter would be eating. So if your son is eating every 3 hours try nursing him at 6 am, pump at 9, 12, 3 and feed at 6pm again. It's a lot of pumping, but it can work if you want it to!  Use the milk you pump for the next day's bottles.|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	you will probably have to pump about two times at least during the day or your milk supply will be to low unless your going to supplement with formula milk is made by supply and demand.
oOla2t2Eaa	No, once you started to bleed, your vaginal lining is coming undone. Alot of things can be used to explain why you were late, and suffered the way you did. Many young women dont understand how much stree can affect your period. The combination of stress, plus your usual pre-menstrual symptoms would cause exactly what you described. Good luck.|`|v3MqaYJIaa	i would say you took it to early <br>  <br>  but then again you might just have really light periods that has happend to me|`|NNdjVI17aa	you could be|`|hORVMOHKaa	yes its possible|`|fzjePK5Haa	The first pregnancy test I took was negative. I waited a few days and got a positive. I now have a 6.5 month old little girl. I would suggest waiting until your period is late and then taking a test that has a digital read out "pregnant" or "not pregnant." <br>  <br>  Also are you experiencing any other symptoms of pregnancy? Some signs show up as early as a few days after conception. Here's a article I found very useful in knowing what to look for. <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recognize-pregnancy-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recogniz...</a>|`|qtA5oCeAaa	you could be wait another week or so and take another test but yes its possible you could in fact be pregnant
eDfh1yhYaa	My baby is having cows milk just on his cereal in the morning and he is 8 months. I also just read in the book "Baby Love" that there is no reason why baby's from 9 months can't drink cows milk... apart from formula companies wanting you to spend your money on their expensive formula tins for the next 3 months till your baby is 12 months old. I intend to start introducing it next month.|`|XXbFFVg8aa	Actually my daughter's pediatrician said to wait until she is 9 months, so that sounds perfectly fine to me! Also, a friend of mine put increasingly more cows milk in her sons formula before he completely switched to cows milk in his bottle, and by the time he WAS 12 months he was drinking all cows milk. Also, my grandparents fed my 6 month old daughter ice cream without me knowing until after, and shes fine (THANK GOODNESS!). So, yes I think it is safe!!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby's pediatrician just told us a few weeks ago to wait until at least 11 months, to avoid tummy troubles.  She said we could give soy milk right now (my baby's 10 months).  My sister's doctor told her that her baby could have milk at 9 months, and she gave her baby cow's milk, and now her baby's allergic to milk.  We don't know for sure that giving her the milk early caused it, but her baby would have about 6 poops a day when she had it.
kaqPSgTVaa	amniotic fluid is watery but thickish at the same time. If you fear you are leaking amniotic fluid then you need to call your doctor. He can do a test to see if you are leaking and it's important to get that checked ASAP.|`|EcQeNu3raa	If you are that sure that its not urine, you need to head to L&D right now. Discharge doesn't come out like that (at least not for me). You need to go to L&D and get them to check. It is way too early for you to be losing amniotic fluid.
24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	geez.. i can only tell u 1 proverb that might help you!!<br>  <br>  when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!!!|`|AA11758925	How are you a failure, you sound like a winner to me. you might need a vacation or some time to yourself, it sounds like your stress is building constantly and you don't wanna just blow up one day and let it all out. You are putting to much pressure on  yourself and got alot on your plate. But always be thankfull for what you got and let your stress out little by little so your fiance or family don't walk into an explosion one day that has been building inside you
UgIOVl1jaa	I'm lucky enough that my Ob has the ultrasound machine in his rooms so he checks on Bubs at every visit which I thought was the norm until I started talking to other pregnant friends & found out that it is not very common at all! I hear a lot of the time the first ultrasound is done at around 12weeks unless they have a concern about ectopic etc. Congratulations! :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	it's more and more common but not every doctor does it. You'll get more ultrasounds by the way. You don't just get one usually.|`|hOkmcVeDaa	I have 5 kids and have only had ultrasounds a couple of times before my 18th week. Most doctors around here wait intill your 18 weeks. The last 2 pregnancys i started bleeding around 7 weeks so they did an ultrasound to make sure everything was ok. And then a few times i lied after that and said i was having pains just so they would do one, i wanted to make sure my baby was ok after all the bleeding i had.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	My doctor didn't do one until 20 weeks, and told me she only does the one unless something seems wrong (and something did seem wrong at 38 weeks).<br>  My sister-in-law went to a different doctor in the same town who did one every single visit.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	I got one at 7 weeks and one to determine gender at around 15 weeks. Other than that, most doctors in my area only do those 2 ultrasounds.. plus a 3D ultrasound at around 28-34 weeks (if you pay for it - insurance doesnt cover this usually).|`|sSRHQkROaa	when i went to the doctor he referred me to a place to get an ultrasound to double check on dates and what not (he doesn't have his own machine).<br>  <br>  i believe they should get you an u/s|`|q8XkxDwCaa	I had an internal ultrasound, heard the heartbeat, and got some pictures at my first visit.  They thought I was 8 weeks at the time but after doing the ultrasound, it turned out I was only 7.  They acted like it was a routine thing used to confirm pregnancy and number of fetuses.|`|UqJkx1nhaa	I know every doc is different. I had one at 5 wks, 9 wks and then 21 wks. I had the one at 9 wks b/c he thought he may have heard two heartbeats! I do know that they are more likely to give them often if they have a machine in their own practice.|`|58G7ZAJpaa	depends.  i had my first u/s with my first child at 8 weeks as well.  I'm married into the military now, and didn't have my first u/s until I was 21 weeks with my son.
DDFSITiYaa	First of all - breathe.  Seriously, take in a deep breath and blow it out.  Repeat.  <br>  <br>  Wipe your tears.  You CAN do it.  And you only have to live each day once.  Break it down into tasks.  Try approaching your husband when you are both calm and see if he can help on some tasks.  Start with 3 things to accomplish tomorrow.  Then tomorrow, set the tasks for the next day. <br>  <br>  You have hit a rough spot but you will get through it.  If you need to, talk to some professors and see if you can get an extension on some homework.  People will help you but you sometimes need to ask for it.|`|TQ47vny4aa	It will be alright you have to thing about your son and his future not just yours and your husbands. You may have to try some type of counseling, try seeing your pastor. I hope it all works out for you, life it to short to go thru it miserable.
TNytY4XBaa	i think its in the 10% range|`|AA10480735	I think it is 7%. My name is Peyton Elizabeth.

O0PfwDJeaa	I was at a "+1 or lower" station at my 36 week check, dilated to 1 and "cervix thin" (they didn't give a percentage).   My little girl was born at exactly 39 weeks.|`|EcQeNu3raa	I'm 38 weeks with #3 and I am not even dilated yet. My first was 3 days early and my second was 3 days late, so there is no telling with this one. I have started to feel some menstrual like cramps the last few days but I'm not due for another appt until next week to see if they are causing any dilation.<br>  She has definitely dropped though, the pressure is intense. If you only 1 cm dilated, you may go over again. 1 cm is basically nothing and some women get stuck before they reach 5 cm.<br>  But you never know, you can go from 1 to 3 in a week so just walk and that will help things along too.
ZwDt9VyYaa	I have 3 beautiful "pill baby's"-yes 3- obviously it doesn't work for me. My youngest was not only with the pill but also a condom was used.

PcjOgAacaa	I know someone who was doing low-dose birth control, and was actually 6-7 months pregnant when she found out.  She thought the birth control pills kept her from having a period.  But it was the pregnancy.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	I was on the Depo-Provera shot, which is continuous birth control, and gives your the symptoms of being pregnant (like all hormone birth control) and I got pregnant. Luckily I was eating really healthy, and since the hormones in birth control are basically the pregnancy hormones, so it's not (too) harmful to the fetus.<br>  So, yes it's VERY possible to get pregnant. I'm very fertile, like the rest of my family.|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	The only people that I know whom have gotten pregnant while 'on' birth control are the ones that admitted that they had 'forgotten' one or two pills and bam they were pregnant! I was on the pill for 3 straight years and took it perfectly and never got pregnant. Of course, I was one of the SMART people who also used the pull out method, a condom, and followed the rhythm method (on top of the pill!) not to get pregnant back when hubby and I were first married and not ready for kids. Using none or only one type of BC is not a smart move if you really don't want to get pregnant.|`|AaxIZSTwaa	My aunt got pregnant (and had healthy babies!) three times when she was on birth control pills. She never missed a day, took them at the same time every day. Some people are just super fertile and it doesn't matter if they are on BC or not.|`|oHWglLZwaa	YES!!!  I have a friend of mine who got pregnant not once, but twice while on the pill...one of those pregnancys were twins!<br>  <br>  BC does not always work...so if you don't want to get prego...just say NO|`|scdOdaTKaa	I know one girl that got pregnant while taking the pill, didn't miss a day nothing and ended up pregnant.  Then I know another girl that got pregnant taking the pill but she had taken two days of antibiotic and the doctor said that caused her birth control to fail. SO it is entirely possible.  I have a friend that knows someone that got pregnant with twins while on birth control.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	i got pg on birth control with both my kids i have now.. i was 19 and 21..  so yes it can happen...

We have often thrown the idea of another child out there, but if we do I would rather do it now than later...I have been extremely blessed with 3 healthy beautiful children and I consider that I may be tempting the fates a bit..not only that but after 40 would seem more risky and for me personally I am looking forward to my 40's as being a bit more independent as the children get more independent---when I turn 40 my oldest will be a 14yr old daughter and my youngest a 7 year old boy with a 11 year old boy in the middle--I don't think I would want to go all the way back to diapers, potty training, etc. at that point--but if it happened by accident I would be ok with it--it's not a yes or no question--I guess I would say I wouldn't do it on purpose at 40 plus...|`|T5ZAYYpNaa	i dont think it really matters anymore since women are more likely to have a career now-a-days.  i just turned 27 and i'll be getting married in a few months, so i will be at least 30 before we have any kids most likely.  true we're only planning 1 maybe 2, but i could easily be 35ish before we're done, so 40 isnt a stretch from there...<br>  <br>  my mom was 30 when she had me (married for 10 years - and i was the only child).   she had medical issues tho and didnt know that until later, but when she was 40 she had to have a hysterectomy.  maybe if she hadnt she would have had another kid??|`|zBz10IiOaa	why not? women are the same weather there 40 or 20 i mean why do people put older women down for that?it is no ones buisness hello my mother in law was 49 when she had my hubby and her husband was 68! what the hell is the problem|`|bTlhBX3daa	I'm not against it by any means. But personally, NO, I would not do it. After 35 there are more risks for both the mother and the baby.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I think women in their 40's should adopt since the risk of birth defects is so high.

qtCVLDFxaa	It depends on the brand you are buying. I use pocket cloth diapers where I insert the liner I need and then use the diaper like AIO. I have two different doubler thicknesses that I can put in the pocket. I also have some hemp liners that I haven't had to use yet. They would go inside the diaper (directly in contact with the skin) plus the liner I usually use would be in the pocket. <br>  <br>  Make sure you are purchasing a reputable brand with ideally a store or a representative in your area who can answer questions, provide info and also other replacement products as you need them. Try health stores or check your yellow pages for the ''hippy'' mom stores. Here in Canada, both Sears and Toys -r-us carry a line of cloth diapers.<br>  <br>  PS- I use microfleece doublers and the diaper barely feels wet inside, so I'm not sure how good they would be for potty training...

9ozDCTDTaa	I am no longer in NY and didn't need a babysitter there, but in Ohio when I was looking into at home care for about that same time the weekly rates were around 150 - 200 a week and I was looking at only people who had experience working with kids.  So I would expect NYC to be a little higher than that.  You could look at college students, perhaps roommates.  I know my roommate and I both babysat for the same family and it worked out great.  Good Luck!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Im not from NY but I would suggest you ask around your friends etc how much does a babysitter costs in your area..<br>  another poster said $4 but it sounds very low... Im in Canada -Toronto and I pay for a babysitter At least $10 an hour! Usually more like 11 or 12. <br>  But that's an occasional babysitter-you know for a night out etc... but I wouldnt pay someone who is looking after my child $4. You want the person who's looking after your baby to be qualified, to have some experience and that costs money.<br>  If somebody is willing to get 4 bucks to look after a baby everyday for 5 hours a day.. I wouldnt trust them.<br>  But thats just me... and still it depends on your economy right.. and the economy of the area where you live.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wphLaVs6aa	I'm guessing you're referring to the city. I did a lot of research this last summer when I was looking for a babysitter to watch my son (4 months old at the time) part time during the week. I found the hourly rate to be $12-15 for a consistent part time (20 hours/week) babysitting arrangement. The babysittes that I found in that range were generally young, in college (for education or something similar) and had a some experience with babies or young children.|`|r5R2nstRaa	in new york, probably 4 dollars an hour
AA10015577	Just keep both in mind because they aren't really that far apart.  My LMP EDD is 7-13 and my U/S EDD is 7-17.  It's nothing really to worry about.

ZSSUfSXwaa	I understand that you co-sleep and it's great I did it for the first few months with my two children. And then I transitioned them to the crib, although I was still breastfeeding. I think it'll be really hard to wean your son of a night feeding while hes there next to you. He can see, smell your milk but he cannot have it! it's like taunting him... you know..so it's really hard for him, it's usually tough to night wean in general because it becomes a habit, and nightweaning while he's right there next to you would be extremely hard. <br>  Right now he's using the boob to soothe -like a pacifier.<br>  My suggestion would be to transition him into the crib. In that way you can feed him before he goes to bed and then in the morning when he wakes up, or if he wakes up one time during the night.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard not to have him sleep with you, but in the end it'll be the best for both you, you certainly need a good night's rest to be able to look after your son and he needs to start self-soothing and resting well at night.<br>  It's going to be a process but it'll be worth it in the end. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  ** Edited for Clarity :)|`|XXbFFVg8aa	Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you should have done this a longgg time ago.<br>  My daughter was 10 weeks old when we asked her pediatrician when we should put her in her crib and that's when she told us that by 3 months babies will start to manipulate their environment! So, we got right to it, believe you me, and within 1 week she was sleeping through the night, gradually. My daughter has been sleeping 12 hours (from 7pm-7am) since she was 3 months old, thanks to our doctor.<br>  <br>  Now, this was when she was 10 weeks, so I imagine it will be harder for an 8 month old baby. Just remember: HE DOES NOT NEED TO EAT. He is doing this out of habit!!<br>  <br>  We just let her cry in increments between 5-15 minutes gradually. DO NOT PICK HIM UP. this will stimulate him and wake him up. I know this sounds really tough, but TRUST me it is worth it! <br>  <br>  I am a happier, more rested mommy and have SO much more energy to play in the day!<br>  <br>  Also, he needs to nap in his crib during the day if he isn't already. This will help familiarize this place with sleep!<br>  <br>  Good luck!! If you stick with it, it WILL work! At one point, I had to have my husband do it (in the beginning) while I took a drive because I couldn't handle it! Do what you need to do, but both you AND baby will be much happier in the end, trust me!!|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	you might want to start putting him in his own crib/cot next to your bed once he's asleep, your baby can smell your milk so maybe smelling it is making it harder for him. Also I have a 8 month old son too, I just pop his binky in his mouth after his feed then he's off to sleep for the rest of the night. But if you are against him having a binky don't try it lol Good luck :)|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Something you need to consider, because I know this is the case with my son, how much is your baby eating during the day?<br>  <br>  II actually did an experiment to see if my pediatrician was right and he was.  The reason my now 7 month old wakes so often at night to nurse is because his intake is low during the day, regardless of how often I offer the breast.  I bottle fed him breastmilk exclusively for 3 days to see how much he was eating and it never exceded 17 ounces between the time he woke up and his last feed before I put him to bed.  Thats means he still needed an additional 10-20 ounces during the night.  Btw, this was with him feeding every 2-3 hours during the day.<br>  <br>  So that may be why regardless of what techniques you are trying your 8 month old still wakes.  He may actually truely be hungry.  For that reason I just accept my sons night waking and try not to wake much when he's nursing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

uFrqC4Y2aa	Sex is actually very good for the baby. Sperm is like an antibiotic for the fetus. And sperm also softens the cervix so it makes delivery easier, and also releases stress which can be harmful to the baby.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's totally fine right through the pregnancy, unless you have the doctor tell you otherwise (in case something is amiss).<br>  Maybe have your bf go through a book with you about pregnancy - this is usually explained somewhere - or go with you to your next dr. visit.<br>  Explain to him that the intimacy is good for both of you to bond, and the hormones are great for your physical health and emotional well-being (you are more relaxed), and thus it's good for baby, too.|`|RDL3wC62aa	you can have sex well into the later stages of your pregnancy|`|JxgzRkk3aa	Yes is is okay!

q1Swxe3qaa	If you want this baby, then have this baby! If you are dedicated to it then you will be a wonderful mother. Don't listen to all the people that will say get rid of it and wait to have babies after you grow up. I had my daughter at 17! If you put your mind to it, and your boyfriend will stick by your side (which he should, you've been together for 3 years already!) then you two can be wonderful parents! Just tell your parents. It will be hard, very hard. I was soooo nervous to tell mine, and yes they took it hard, but they got over it. My daughter (who is currently 19 months old) is their light of their life! She is the center of both my parents and my boyfriends parent's world!  I think that both you and your boyfriend should go to tell them, and I also think that you sister can go too if you want her there for the support. You can do it! :) Good luck! and CONGRATULATIONS!! :)|`|eEK3m1aXaa	First, bring your fiance...it was only you who got you pregnant. If your family is going to be upset with you it'll help you to have someone there for you. <br>  Second, just come out and tell them. Don't beat around the bush or find cute ways to tell them. An easy way for you to tell them would be to send them an Easter card or something and sign it from you and baby...that way, you'll have the ice broken before you go home for a visit. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~_~|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Who are you telling?<br>  <br>  I just screamed it out for the entire world to hear.

They hopes for you and sister have been thrown away in their eyes, but i say this is just a new chapter and they will enjoy both babies when they are born. <br>  <br>  Keep your head up and stay positive.<br>  <br>  My parents were not happy when i told them i was pregnant, my daughter is 7 today and they couldn't love her anymore!|`|qfuhHeDjaa	don't let them beat you down about it. with my first everyone was like your parents were with your sister and i spent the whole pregnancy bummed with my second they were even more disappointed but i was happy, he was happy, it was so much more enjoyable.<br>  <br>  o and with my first i was 19 and in school too!|`|u2RrglPiaa	you should go with your sister and partner as they will both support you. let your parents know that this has happened and they cant change it, and that you would like them to respect your decision, and you would like their support and guidance through this time. <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	well, you really shouldn't tell anyone till you are 3months along or better. and yes take your boyfriend, you cannot control there reaction, so expect the worse hope for the best, and be happy it is a wonderful blessing. good luck and congrats|`|5Vh876cPaa	This will definitely be difficult to tell them. But if you are 100% sure you want this baby then you must face the music. I would bring your fiance and your sister when facing your parents. Sure they will be mad/upset in the beginning but they will come around. Stop stressing out as it's not really good for you baby. In fact is can lead to problems especially during your first trimester. You have to focus on you baby right now and that should be your only concern.<br>  <br>  19 is pretty young to have a child and to be in school at the same time. Your fiance saying and actually doing is completely 2 different things. If he is not there to support you, please think of alternative arrangements when baby comes so you don't drop out of school.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	hi there, the only thing that matters here is if you want this baby. no one else has the right to tell you how to live your life. and just because they find kids annoying does not mean you feel the same way. if you don't know how to take care of a baby i'm sure your sister will help you as she will also be going through the same thing you are, you could even go to classes together. you should go with you're fiance and just tell them you have some good news and say you're pregnant and you are happy and that's all that matters. if you're parents won't support at least you know you have the loving support of your fiance and your sister. i wish you all the best throughout your pregnancy, good luck. oh and congratulations! x|`|iLLoc003aa	You can have your baby if you have the support but don't quit school!

1GhxKubjaa	When I had my first child at 16, I attended a program for teen moms to finish school. There were about 20 other teen moms there, and most of them formula fed their babies. (I was the only mom who spent my breaks hoofing it down to the daycare portable to quickly feed my baby) I did that for a year!<br>  I don't know why that is. I remember wanting to give up breastfeeding in the beginning because it was so painful at first. I probably would have, but my baby wouldn't  take a bottle! I remember asking some of the other girls why they didn't breastfeed, and they either said it was gross, or that they didn't like the feeling, or that they wanted to be able to leave their baby with a babysitter.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	i don't think its an age factor.  it's a personal decision every mom needs to make for herself, and any woman, no matter there age should be pushed into doing something they are not comfortable with.We all heard that breast is best speech a million times, but in reality is isn't best for the mom in some cases.  When the mom is comfortable feeding her baby her way, the baby is better off.|`|ftvxAS3saa	im going to at least attemp to breastfeed, i feel its a good thing to do, but im not sure how long i will do it for|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	im 18 and will breastfeed my son|`|jNErU39iaa	I had my daughter when I was 18, and yes, she was breastfed until around 6 months of age.<br>  I don't think it's necessarily teen mothers that choose not to breastfeed, it's *mostly* mothers of any age who give up because it's 'too hard'.|`|okp0CMc3aa	i was 19 when i had my son and breast fed him, i go to a young mothers pre and post natal group where they are educated about the benefits of breastfeeding and 90 percent of the teen mothers at least try to breastfeed.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I got pregnant at 19 and had my baby at 20 and I am breastfeeding.

p11HaDIWaa	well all through my pregnancy i told myself i wanted to do it natural but after talking to the anesthesiologist about the epidural, and not to mention the excruciating labor pain, i decided to get one. and it was the best thing ever invented lol i was pretty numb but not in a painful way and i was able to sleep and talk to my family and not feel the horrible contractions and when it came time to push i felt a little pressure and started pushing away with no problems at all, then about 30 minutes after i had my baby the nurse cleaned me up and helped me stand up and walked me to the bathroom, my legs felt a little wobbly but it wasn't too bad i was able to walk back from the bathroom alone. then they served me regular breakfast and i ate it with no problems...i am definitely going to have another epidural with this baby i'm having next month...good luck to u:)<br>  edit* i think its funny for women to say that having an epidural makes it hard to push or drugs the baby...that's ridiculous how would they know when they've never had it. i mean think about it why would a Dr. give u something that is going to harm ur baby??? and my daughter was on my boob less then 20 minutes after she was born (and still is for that matter, almost 2) do what u want and don't let these other women talking u into doing what they want u to do millions and millions of women get the epidural and  its been around for years, sure back in the 1800s women had no choice but hello its 2009 people...good luck to u again:)|`|kxIMaqaKaa	I gave birth 3 months ago, was my first and i got the epi cuz i was in back labor for 20 hours!!! It was hell and i'm really not a sissy when it comes to pain. The epidural didn't hurt all i felt was a lil sting that's it, my legs and everything else got numb immediately, it was such a funny feeling ;-) And i didn't feel any pain but i still felt the contractions but really painless.When it was time to push i felt it stretching a lil but just for a sec cuz your too busy tryin to get the baby out you won't really pay attention to that. It only took me about 6 min and my son was born ;-) I think after that i waited an hour before i got up and went to the bathroom could have gotten up sooner but you have to wait because your legs are still numb. I would do the epi over and over again it was a great experience!!! It wasn't hard for me to do things that day i was up and walkin and everybody was like : are you sure you just had a baby?? lol But on whatever you decide i wish you good luck and you will get through it ;-)|`|n3FfpRqCaa	For me, I still felt the pressure--it just took the pain away.  Towards the end tho, the epidural didn't help--it hurt!  But, definately not as bad as people who did not have an epidural.  I tried to have a natural birth, but with 8 hours of hard labor being induced..I opted for the epidural for the remaining 11 hours.|`|C8JKsvdmaa	any type of pain relief is not good for the baby, it can make them drowsy, slow to respond feed etc, give birth naturally your body is designed for it. i gave birth to both my daughters naturally and only used deep breathing to help <br>  epidurals can make it really hard for you to push or know when to push and you are more likely to require assistance in the form of forceps. do the best thing for you and your baby, go natural unless you have a valid reason for intervention. i was up 30mins after giving birth and was back home in the morning i plan to have a home birth next time round|`|KJkyqI9Laa	An epidural is not safe for mom and baby, no medication during pregnancy, labor, and birth is safe!  Give birth naturally...your body is designed for it, it is the safest way to give birth, and your body and your baby will be free of drugs!  You will have no restrictions during your labor, and will be free to go home within a few hours of birth!  <br>  <br>  Don't birth in a hospital...go to a birthing center or have a home birth.  Research has shown that women who are low risk are SAFER to birth out of a hospital than in one.  Natural birth is wonderful!  I did it and it was an awesome experience and I can't wait to do it again!|`|hOkmcVeDaa	With my second i got an epidural it didn't really hurt as much as i expected just a little pinch and some strange feeling along my spine. The birth was great i didn't feel a thing, after i felt nothing i wasn't even sore im not sure if its because i had a 7lbs 5oz baby before or if it was because she was smaller. I was up within 30 min doing things. Good luck!!|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I had an epidural-it hurt pretty bad putting it in-I did not get numb at all-I still felt everything!  I will not be getting an epidural this time around!
etUFe6tJaa	I am 12 weeks and still get the twinges and pains now and then. Things are moving and growing on a daily basis so it is not unusal.  Unless they become unbearable or comes with bleeding then it becomes a problem.  <br>  <br>  I know it is scary - I can totally relate.  But wait another week, then you should be ready for your first ultrasound.  It should give you a peace of mind once you see your little bubba's heart beating away.|`|ZeJav7rUaa	I am a mother to 4 children and im 24 its normal it is just where your body is trying to adjust to the baby and your  uteris is stretching so no worries ok try to do small and mild walks this is good for your body and will help also try worm baths good luck...|`|n3FfpRqCaa	Yes, I usually found that happened when I was overdoing it. When Is at down & rested it would calm down.|`|35kVNi5oaa	When ever i would have pain my doctor would say that its just my uterus stretching.|`|2NdSyZMBaa	some women have cramps early in their pregnancy. this is very common within the 1st 9 to 14 weeks i believe. some women even have their period up to 3 months to 4months of being pregnant. although if the pain gets worse don't wait see doctor. because severe pain may mean the pregnancy could be tubal. though this is rare unless there is family history of this. but in any case just keep up on doctors appointments and don't hesitate to ask your gyn questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|it3GnvdDaa	go to the er or the doctors as soon as you can.. it could be really serious|`|S4DNQkFraa	It's probably round ligament stretching. Your body is just preparing for the growth of the baby. As long as it doesn't get worse of is associated with any pain or bleeding/clots, you're fine. It's so normal. If you're truly worried, call your doc. He will understand. Congrats and G/L!!|`|1k6UUC8qaa	it could be but to be on the safe side you should see your doctor better safe than sorry
FERfSYtzaa	girl it is not that serioous to be skippin school and ruinin your grades for a bunch of girls that has no sense and anything better to do but to ridicul other girl.|`|tiW6RAfLaa	girl you need to go back to school.. you dont know that there going to do something to you. lots a girls talk crap but they really dont follow through most of the time. dont let your grades go down just bec ause you think that someone is going to beat you up! chances are there not. but if they do get worse tell the counsler or something. :)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Tell the principla/guidance counselor what's going on.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Talk to an adult.  tell your parents and have your parents contact the principal of the school.  Its not fair or right for you to be skipping and losing out on a good education because other girls are being immature and ignorant.  You need to do what is right for YOU and dont worry about what they will think. Going to an adult is the most responsible thing you could do.  good luck.  I hope things get better for you.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Get a body guard. <br>  <br>  x] <br>  Ever since I've been hanging out with this guy people haven't had the guts to say anything to me. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or simply tell your parents. Skipping and not telling anyone can get you into a bigger, badder, situation then just your grades going down.|`|p3d3E75oaa	don't be a punk and stand up for yourself, don't let no one run you out of school it would be a cold day in he*l I would, I don't know where you live but where Im from Ill be quick to kick someones as*  good luck|`|hswTS1jVaa	Tell your parents or teacher.|`|58e95a5bcb9b3b1cb28831601a8bb259aa	Telling your parents or principal might help for day or 2 but as soon  they are not watching over you those girls will try to do something bad to you. What you got to do is find some teacher  in your school that you think have been bullied. Those teachers know how it feels and will protect you.|`|vlKnBlYIaa	If you're not willing to tell someone who can help you, take a teaspoon of cement and harden up. Their words or actions can't hurt you if you don't let them. But your best option would be to talk to your school counsellor/chaplain, they can't tell anyone unless you are in physical danger and may give you some good advice. You'd be surprised how understanding these people can be give em a go.|`|rB3cyt0Paa	i know you don't want to be a "tattletale" . But if they don't leave  you alone then you'll have to. or you can a bunch of your friends and have them team up with you against the mean girls|`|BPJetCrsaa	K I dunno what grade your in but stop being a ***** and stand up for yourself, Those bitches wont do ****, most girls are all talk. Don't tell your parents, that's ******* stupid|`|LddkW0JFaa	You need to find better friends.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Tell your parents. that's really the only way it can be solved. or when you go in school just ignore what they say.|`|E6fFXfWnaa	tell your mum they're bullying you and change schools|`|6fx6R4LCaa	stand up for you self you and you freinds should go and beat there ***
NgeZASTYaa	Get some Acidophilus BioBeads (not just regular Acidophilus), and take 1 a day for 2 weeks - if you don't see an improvement, then go see a GI doctor (Gastro Intestinal Dr)|`|Av9jeRAkaa	go to a doctor, this doesn't sound good, but my mom says it's not good o eat dairy and meat at the same time, so try and lay off one of them for a while<br>  <br>  you could just eat bread, and nothing but dry things, like wheat, this helps you, and also drink Pepsi, or Coke, they help you as well, trust me ... hope you get better!<br>  <br>  experience|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Anti-diareal|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Diarrhoea isnt that bad. Your body is just expelling all the crap that you've eaten. Watch your foods as well. Some foods are diarrhetic. Like peanut butter, coffee, etc, etc. Its nothing to "go to the doctor" about, or "seek professional help" for. Thats crap. Theres nothing wrong with you. It will soon pass. Just let it happen though. Your body needs it.|`|BGCiqQFgaa	Go to a doctor. You could have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Celiac Disease, or any other number of conditions. You might even have some sort of deficiency! Do not leave this untreated!|`|jcEtRUVZaa	You could be lactose intolerant. Try eliminating dairy for a week or two.
xhT8bJeHaa	Just calm down do something that can get you busy go to school and get help from your parents contact his parents and think about your baby. or go to church if your not a church person try to read the bible every night.God bless you|`|ygM3geiDaa	What do you know about this young man's parents? Perhaps they would be willing to give   you updates. Guessing and feeling so much stress is truly NOT for you to be experiencing. This calling around all over the place is just not working for you or anyone. I wish you much peace.|`|6TxREZWdaa	well 1st dont think of it.. i no it sounds stupid but sometimes the best solutions are the most smple of thoughts.. if not that try doing puzzles 2 keep ur mind busy... play video games if u kan even if its something like tetris.. uy may not like video games but they are a great distraction.. make sure u arent alone because that will juss make it worse.. most people are happier around others because when ur bi urself ur foced 2 just think and think and with sum1 else around there is a distraction.. good luck 2 ur boyfriend i hope everything goes well|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Have you talked to his parents or any of his other family members? Try giving them a call. Does he have a cell number? God Bless|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I think being able to talk to him would be the only thing to really calm you down.
ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	The first day BACK OFF AND GIVE US OUR MOMENT.<br>  <br>  The 2nd day.... 'Welcome, You've got Mail!'<br>  <br>  You need to do what is going to make you both most comfortable.  A good suggestion would be to have a few visitors like (gram and gramp) come visit at hospital, and a few days after you get settled in at home...have the troops come in to visit.|`|QP46eVi4aa	Wow i loved having everyone there cause they had got us so much while we was expecting and they was such a great support system the whole way.<br>  <br>  Also i think as long as they are not sick that they should get to come and celebrate with us on that special day with pictures and i would hate to have to have anyone to leave it was a great day and they just made it more specials about stories of there kids when they was younger<br>  <br>  so me it woul be the more the merrier|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	With my daughter...her father and I had our time...a couple hours with her before people started to come and then we didn't care who came because we wanted to show her off.  With this baby, my boyfriend and I will probably do the same...get our time alone with baby (actually the hospital doesn't recommend visitors for the first few hours after baby's born anyway so we can have our time with baby) and then we will call and I know everyone will show up and we don't mind...we want to show baby off!  Plus, baby and I will be moving 3.5 hours away 3 weeks after baby's born, so we want everyone to see baby.  Of course, if it's 3 a.m. we will wait and call everyone in the morning!|`|Hf5doDxsaa	I really didn't like it.  I love all my friends and family, and I definitely wanted everyone to meet my baby, but it was all just too overwhelming.  I was soo tired-long story, but I gave birth at midnight then didn't go to sleep until almost 5am (and it's not like I really slept), with visitors at 10 am.  I was trying to breast feed and I am very modest not to mention that baby was on the boob for a min of 45 minutes then still hungary.  It sucks to have to kick people out of the room for so long.  So then I would find myself awkwardly trying to do it in the room.  Anyway, it's a loose loose situation, because once you get home it's even worse.  Friends and family are more comfortable so they stay longer.  I was stuck in the nursery breast feeding  all by myself (bored out of my mind) while my husband entertained the guests.  I guess it's just something you have to deal though!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	No one but family is allowed to see us after I have my daughter, I don't think it should be a circus event when I know I'm going to be feeling horrible. Plus I'd like some time to get to know my daughter and let her family do so, when we get home and we both are settled I'll start having visitors. It's not an easy decision to make when everyone wants to be there and I know I sound a tiny bitchy for it but oh well.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i think a few are ok, like your parents, grandparents, and close friends but i wouldnt have the whole world come visit you. what i intend to do is have my immediate family come then a week or so after the baby is home have people start coming over and spending more time with the baby. thats also because i live away from family and friends and when people come to visit there going to be staying a couple of days so i want to make sure i'm rested to have company in my home|`|ca9dEvSAaa	uh, I really have mixed feelings. This is the very first grand baby, great grand baby, and there hasn't been a baby born in 10 years on my side. So everyone wants to see her. My hospital only allows 4 people at a time, so that helps.<br>  <br>  I guess as long as I can get a shower, and the hospital is strick about visting hours, I will be happy.|`|ydPmxntpaa	well you definitely need some time and rest to recover after the birth but whenever you feel comfortable to let visitors in...it's a pretty rewarding exreance|`|1qKSU6ACaa	personally i prefer just to have a few of the people we are closest to stop by for a little bit.  when i had my first son people were coming and going all day long and it was just sooo exhausting...with my second i told people to back off and only had about 5 people stop by it was much more relaxing.  I will only be having a few come with this baby too.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	Me personally..i want anyone who wants to be there to visit! i cant wait to show him off to the world..you will have your personal moments with them at home and when you have your bonding time like during feedings!|`|zlciavc1aa	Not to sound mean but, i'd say back off give us this moment. we will be home shortly.  Being tired and in pain, last thing on my mind will be having to stay awake for visitors.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'm somewhere in between. I'm only inviting people that my husband and I are very close to. I know I'll be exhausted and wanting to rest so I don't want tons of people there.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I think the more the merrier at the hospital. I wanted to share him with everyone. Don't have visitors the first few day when you go home because that is when you are going to be exhausted and want to get settled in.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	i think its nice to have people there to welcome your new blessing it doesn't mean they have to be in the room with you when we had my first son my husband and my friend and her mom came and went it was fine with me i really needed the support because i didn't really have family there my sister n law and her husband and kids were there in the waiting room which was fine with my 2nd child my mom was supposed to be in the delivery room but she was sick so she couldn't be there so it was just me and my husband and that was fine but no one came to visit and i felt up to visitors but no one came it made me a little sad cuz man i wanted the world to see this new miracle i helped welcome into this world but of course i survived but it was a tad lonely anyways if you dont mind having them share the joy in the waiting room then do it i dont see it as a bad thing its just people being happy and excited for you good luck and God Bless!!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	it was okay with me as long as it was only a couple at a time and spaced apart nicely.. at one point about 10 people came all at once and I got REALLY emotional and stressed and had to send them all away after about 5 minutes.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I would think the more the merrier until I'm ready to get some sleep. I've been told a million times to get as much sleep as possible in the hospital.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i'l be telling everyone im in labour but would be pissed off if they all just invite themselves to see our baby most people that know me know i like notice and if theyr not invited then i usually dont want them over
ygzYphCqaa	im pregnant too and i told my parents right away. . . <br>  im very young by the way (14) so i was scared.<br>  but i waited to tell everyone else up until i was 12 weeks<br>  bcuz there is a chance of miscarriage in your first trimester. <br>  thats what my doctor told me.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	How old are you??|`|MdYQlMfeaa	tell your mom and go to the doctor those should always be the first two things done..|`|NI5vUHKQaa	Yes, you should cause she going to find out soon or later|`|e2dca065e545ee4cd3fdc002fc291f8caa	tell your mom.|`|Tj4P6opQaa	How old are you?
mVXBOI6Qaa	Ya....sounds like she should be farther along.  They go by your LMP.  So, that would put her at about 11.5 weeks.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	believe what she says. thats your brother and sister in laws business not yours. i guess it will all make since when the babies born then you'll know all the answers to your questions.|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	yeah, don't stress... they do go by the date of your last menstrual period, but when you have your period you aren't getting pregnant that day either. it's not quite how the body's cycle works. you have to ovulate to be pregnant, and that happens a certain number of days after your period starts. the doc's charts allow for all of that and are able to calculate based on the date of the first day of the last period. i don't know how all their stuff actually works, but ir usually works our most of the time to be very accurate. <br>  <br>  let them enjoy their pregnancy, and just be happy for them. and keep super close tabs on your own sexual activity, so you can figure out how the doc does it when its your turn! :)<br>  <br>  i wish your brother and sister in law all the best. good luck to you too!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If they are going Friday then it's a scheduled ultrasound....I think you need to relax. Why the heck would she be lying? There would be no point. It's possible she is 8 weeks and she missed a period. That DOES happen regardless of how regular you are...Also why do you know she's really regular? Do you keep track of her periods or something? Chill and be happy for them.
ObngW3xxaa	Yes its fine, As a matter of fact I had that last week. I'm always craving subway, especially the oven roasted chicken breast...YUM!!! Enjoy it!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Why wouldn't it be?|`|klpNrhhAaa	NO!<br>  <br>  Eating chicken beast during pregnancy is one of the worst things you can do to your baby.<br>  <br>  They will grow up to be cowardly and tender!<br>  <br>  Eat beef jerky so that they grow up tough.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Absolutely! I eat hot pastrasmi sandwiches from subway ocasionally. I really like them toasted on wheat bread. lol<br>  <br>  However, roasted chicken breast sounds really good! Enjoy your sandwich!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Of course. Why would you ever think roasted chicken is bad to eat?|`|v0aKxF6iaa	Yes its safe its fully cooked and a good source of protein|`|PcjOgAacaa	Yes.  They only say that cold lunch meat can be a problem for listeria bacteria.  So, the roasted chicken is not cold, nor is it lunch meat, so it's fine.  If you want lunch meat, they can microwave it until steaming, and then it is safe to eat.|`|hOkmcVeDaa	Yes its fine. They say not to eat cold lunch meat but i did all 5 times and nothing bad happened, they say it very rare to catch listeria. I also put sweet in low in my ice tea all the time and with my first ate a ton of tuna and all my kids turned out great.|`|kePcrUYTaa	yea. its good for you u shuld b fine
WXExyAlWaa	You're giving slightly conflicting messages here... "I want what's best for her, which is to be a mum", "When we married she was iffy about even having kids".<br>  <br>  You need to listen to what she wants. Assume for now that you're both fertile. If she wants a biological child you can try for one. Most couples are perfectly able to conceive just fine on their own, after all. If it turns out that you guys are one of the few that can't, you can cross that bridge when you come to it. She might not want to be a mum QUITE as much as you want her to be, even now. You can talk to her then about options - fertility treatments, fostering, adoption, but for now why make an issue where there doesn't need to be one?|`|DDFSITiYaa	Wow that is a lot of things to think about.  I think you're right - I'd clam up about adoption right now because it isn't even on the table yet.  You can think about it all you want but she may not want to even go there yet. Doesn't mean never, just not right now.  Life will unfold the way it is supposed to.  If it ever comes to that point in your life, you will have that battle ahead of you.  <br>  <br>  But let me tell you a little story - my best friend got married to a man who had been adopted as a baby.  Never knew his bio parents, happily raised by his adopted parents.  He had biological children with his first wife.  After he and my friend married, they started for a baby right away.  It required his vasectomy reversal and some other surgery on her part.  Nothing.  Fertility treatments - nothing.  In vitro - twice - nothing.  He had suggested adoption all along and finally she came around.  They ended up adopting a baby boy.  My friend is over the moon for him and is very content, fulfilled, and feels that this is their  son, no question.  But the dad?  He is having a hard time bonding with his adopted son.  Can't really say why but perhaps it is the biological experience he already had or perhaps it is because the baby is another race.  Who knows.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Try explaining to her why adoption is important for the child. Like tell her that there are children out there who need a family(every child deserves a family)<br>  <br>  Tell her that it shouldn't matter where the child comes from as long as you have a child.<br>  <br>  Just don't force anything on her and be patient maybe she'll start to warm up to the idea.
97d50db6a834f02ae3b73b75b4c0a135aa	Yes it is possible to loose it in bits. Don't think I've lost it all at once ever and I have 3 kids. Are you having any other issues? like contractions? If so call the Doc. Labor happens in stages more than usually right out. You should be at the point where your seeing your Doc  about every week  so you're ok. Relax yourself and get lots of rest your time will be coming soon.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	yes I lost some at 34 weeks.  Then a little bit around 39 weeks then the rest at 40 weeks exactly when I went into labor.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	YES IT POSSIBLE FOR A PIECE TO BREAK OFF. CALL YOUR DR JUST IN CASE.|`|VKd2vs2Taa	go to see your doctor your baby may be on the way.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	its not uncommon to loose some, then lose more later in the day or the following day. You should go in anyways to be check out to make sure it was your plug and not a leak from the sac (which it probebly wasnt). Remember, the plug just seals the cervix so you are still ok from infection and it does not mean you will go into labor right away, it could be another week to 4 weeks still for ya. good luck|`|nqHSQpqZaa	Well I think it's normal lots of women just mistake it for discharge. If it was thick, mucousy, and reminded you of snot it's probably part of it. You are probably starting to dilate. Dilation causes parts of the mucous plug to come out. Mine started doing that at 32 weeks but I didn't have my son until 39 weeks and 4 days.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Totally normal.  It can dislodge as a whole or come in pieces.  No need to call your dr. It can happen WEEKS before labor. Just means your cervix is softening up!<br>  Good luck|`|5JB1fHz9aa	Yeah I lost mine in pieces over a period of like 3 days.  I would call your doctor because you are only 35 weeks, but labor could still be weeks away.|`|YCICrIKyaa	Yep. My step sister had her plug come out in parts. It didn't come out all at once or even in the same day. You are ok. Just mention that to your doctor the next time you see him!
i6mydMOyaa	As long as you are keeping the semen from leaking out, you are getting the job done!<br>  <br>  My doc said it was as simple as a pillow under your hips, just enough to tilt the pelvis so the semen heads up and back. He never mentioned leg position!<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|oHNrktxTaa	My OBGYN had suggested that as well as my sister who is a labor & delivery nurse. <br>  Who knows if this actually works though. I have to say, I prop a pillow beneath & hold my legs up for 20 minutes. It is to help the flow of sperm to lead it to where it needs to go. I was also told not to urinate right after either.<br>  Hopefully it works! It doesnt hurt to try:)<br>  Good Luck & BABY DUST!!!!!|`|PcjOgAacaa	You don't have to put your legs straight up in the air.  Raising your butt up on a pillow should be sufficient.  I got pregnant from a standing behind position (sorry if TMI) and then I immediately got into a shower. So...I didn't raise my butt and got pregnant.  Besides, who can stick their legs straight up in the air for the 15-20 minutes they tell you to rest?!?  :)|`|CzAsukYtaa	i always put just one pillow under me but not one that is to hight si i am up a lil bit but still almost flat if that makes sence then i keep my legs straight|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I actually have read and heard that its best to just lie totally flat. If you tilt your pelvis too far it can cause the sperm to go too far past the opening of the cervix. Everyone has a different theory though.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	well like everyone else is saying... just a small pillow should help.. don't matter about your legs. they don't produce anything.. Just try to relax and have fun with it..
N2uoyAqdaa	Yes hun, you could defo be preg take a test to be sure :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and baby dust x|`|Ga3eIvPNaa	You very well could be. I'd say the only way to know for sure is to take a test!!
aUgzwKWlaa	I am pretty sure you are pregnant. Although you might want to take a pregnancy test. Your symptoms are the signs of a natural pregnant woman, so I would believe you are pregnant.|`|5VpboyKgaa	Girl! I went through the same thing about 3 years ago with my SON!<br>  The symptoms where there but when I took the first test, there was two lines but the second was light, not I took another the next day and the second line did not show up fast, so I threw it in the garbage, 10 minutes later I said to my self, " let me check" and there was the line. I went to the doc 1 week later and there it was...pregnancy!<br>  Sounds like you really want to be pregnant! Good luck!|`|uWktmSj4aa	If you see two lines even though one is lighter than the other you are pregnant. You sound just like me when i had my first baby. I took every brand pregnancy test I could find and sure enough I was pregnant. So honey you are pregnant. I worked for an OBGYN for some time too. Just go to one of those doctors offices that have free pregnancy testing. Look it up in the phone book|`|hORVMOHKaa	i would ask your doctor to do a blood a test or request an ultrasound just so you can know for sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust|`|Ga3eIvPNaa	you could be pregnant just your still early and your levels might not be high enough to trigger those tests that came out negative.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	The pregnancy tests you buy at the pharmacy test for very high progesterone levels, and if you're only 10 days late, a lot of times you're hormone levels aren't high enough, so you can get mixed results. I would suggest going and getting a blood test to be sure, and from there, the doctor can begin to monitor your hormone levels to make sure they are raising correctly. Once you're at the doctors they can do an ultrasound and may be able to tell you how far along you are. But, a lot of times, it's hard to tell if you're only a couple weeks along. <br>  You should start taking pre-natals now if you haven't already, and eat healthy (be sure not to eat too much sugar if you're body isn't used to it so you don't get pregnancy diabetes). As long as you go into the doctor before you're 14-16 weeks along, you'll be fine. Some women go into the ER complaining of stomach cramps, and when they leave, they have a baby. So... your body will take care of the baby.|`|KDbpIABsaa	Shoulder sags after weight loss?<br>  I lost about 100lbs around july 2007..it took me like 4 months to lose all that weight. I did it by rarely eating and throwing up. I gained an additional 30pounds or so...Is it possible one side has more fat than the other. As of now I weigh 175lbs, and used to weigh about 145-150 pounds....I am 5 feet 6 inch old male and am 18 years old. I HAVE SAGGING FAT( its fat not really skin cause its kind of thick)- breast and pubic fat.<br>  <br>  MY RIGHT shoulder sags more lower than the the left one...and when i walk it looks as if im walking on my right side..WHAT SHOULD I DO???|`|scdOdaTKaa	It sounds like you just need to go to the doctor.  I would say you are pregnant as false positives are very rare....but go to a doctor and tell them and ask for confirmation from them. Good luck!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	do a blood test and ultrasound.. good luck.. i wish you best of luck.. and also i just read somewhere that 1st response pregnancy tests are one of the best and stuff so if that helps.. i hope so..!!|`|wYBur7c7aa	hmm i'm not quite an expert on these things but lucky for you i just had health class! For one the pregnancy test could be not working. I suggest to wait a while and then take one. It could be anything and if you just wait a week or so maybe these things will go away. Don't go crazy on these pregnancy tests just yet, wait a while and chill. You sound like you are going nuts! ahaahaa okay just kidding.<br>  If you are pregnant good luck and wish your baby the same!|`|CzAsukYtaa	i would still believe u are preg seeing as u got a positive at the dr's both u and ur dr saw it congrats and good luck|`|qfPnl61baa	I would definatly go to the doctor and have them take a blood test....then you will know for sure!!|`|Z50bcZgTaa	ur preg. good luck
eGwAtFEUaa	I know its in homor of the dad but i dont like the name dusty. i like areliegh better.|`|HvXzS9acaa	:'-( Sad story. I think it's precious that she's being called "Dusty," after her daddy. The whole name is a bit of a mouthful, but it's still adorable :-)|`|TNytY4XBaa	its a sad story and i think the little girl will be proud of it ones she hears the story behind it. Its kewl.|`|WVqoLROFaa	i think thats adorable and awesome and sentimental.<br>  tdfl|`|IEZoHcysaa	I think it is a perfect way to help her dad live on.|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	its her baby|`|dVAiuqZCaa	that's sweet,and It's a cute name.|`|qfPnl61baa	Awwww...What a sad situation...

I am glad to be an american and know we have that right!|`|Elxuvon8aa	That is sad but yes the name is okay  I knew an Arlajean|`|bIaywrBCaa	I like it. It is different and a great way to honor the dad. So much sadness for a young woman and her baby to go thru.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I think she probably did that out of grief and may or may not regret it later.<br>  <br>  It's sweet that her name pays homage to her lost father.  I think the girl WILL like it when she learns the story.|`|DP48dIxhaa	That sucks...I'm sorryyyyyy (nawt like she will ever c that). I don't like that name....but since it has that meaning behind it I guess it's okk|`|OYy82bAYaa	Awwww how cute that is so nice and a memorable way to remember her partner nice good on her sad for her loss.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	How very sad. The name is horrible. (not Dusty but the other two).
1GhxKubjaa	two of my babies were born on full moons and the maternity ward was busy! My third and last baby was born a few days before the full moon, and I mentioned to the nurse how quiet the maternity wing was and she said "Yeah, it is now, but there's a full moon coming up and that's when it gets crazy"<br>  So I believe that more babies are born during full moons, and any one who works in the delivery wing of a hospital believes this as well!|`|z0Ac06claa	My son was born on a full moon. So were 11 others that night. I am a believer. Congrats sounds like you are almost there.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My OB said that to me before. =)<br>  <br>  I hope you go in to labor too. =)|`|OGCohFyNaa	My OB/GYN is a friend of mine on Facebook, and he's always posting stuff about how he's delivering a ton of babies on full moons. He delivered 12 in one night a couple months ago. <br>  <br>  I can't say whether or not I believe that there is some reason for this, or if it's just a fluke, but it *does* seem like it's a little too frequent to be a coincidence.
bSjbVxO2aa	I agree with the one above that said just talk to her. Talk about what you are doing, like cooking or folding laundry. <br>  <br>  Read read read books to her. <br>  <br>  Sing the ABC song, count to 10 on your fingers, holding them up in front of her. <br>  <br>  Every word you say is making a mark on her little brain! <br>  <br>  My 2 year old knows colors, shapes, and can count to 10. She's 2 going on 23. And just as sassy.<br>  <br>  <br>  For physical, pratice cycling with her legs...round and round, babies love that. Stand her up (as best she can with you holding her) and let her push off the ground. Or put your hands against her feet as she lays on the ground and have her push your hands back. <br>  <br>  Clap her hands together. <br>  <br>  Read any book you can. The books with bright pictures and colors are great, but she will love listening to you read anything, even the newspaper. <br>  <br>  Good looking out for baby, Momma!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Talk to her.  Not baby talk, just chat with her.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Read her simple stories, sing songs, take her for walks and point out objects, do songs with actions and help her to do the mostly be repititious if you sing the same songs, read the same books and point out the same objects she will pick them up alot quicker. If you want to concerntrate on her motor skills you could contemplate enrolling her her in a Gymbaroo/ree type class, my daughter went from 4 months until 11 months and she loved it. Good luck :)<br>  <br>  It honestly doesnt matter about the bright simple books for now...well not the ones you read to her but she would like to play with them but it is a good idea to start with them because then as she grows she will be familiar with them.
lRZsPBH6aa	Fiona makes me think fo Shrek. Dont do it.<br>  <br>  I think Coralie is really pretty and unique. Plus I think you should stick with your 1st instinct. <br>  <br>  Coralie is really pretty and you can nick name her Cora or Coral or Lee or Rose. <br>  <br>  Only nickname I can think of for Fiona is Fifi and that sounds like a dog. <br>  <br>  You could always wait and hold Fiona for the future. Maybe you will have another child or maybe when this one gets old enough you will let her get a small puppy and you can talk her into naming it Fiona.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...good luck and God bless :)|`|AA10015577	What about Coralie Fiona?<br>  <br>  I like Coralie Rose best, but they both sound good.

If so I would cross Coralie off the list. It's too similar. Although it is beautiful.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Coralie Rose!!

Especcially if your name is Caroline. Coralie and Caroline are two close, that would be too confusing. I would know. My name is Kristen and my mom's name is Kristy. It gets really annoying.|`|X77Kzh7baa	Coralie is nice but i'd always think about Coraline and freak out and then Fiona is nice but i'd always think of shrek<br>  <br>  <br>  i'd go with fiona because it's pretty, unique, and easy to pronounce...|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	Fiona Rose|`|RkjOxucAaa	Fiona Rose|`|fkdvQPYmaa	Fiona reminds of a green, fat creature.

Drop  Rose and name her Coralie Fiona.  I think thats gorgeous!!!!|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I love Fiona Rose
GVlIktLpaa	I think you should really keep it.  My two youngest children are 14 months apart, so we had a double stroller.  We also had several singles.  The double was very cumbersome, and difficult to navigate in certain places.  Also at times Myself or my husband would take one child out alone.  It is always good for Moms and Dads to have things that are quick and simple, ready to go...  The older child will also likely be proud to be big enough to walk, perhaps holding on to your hand or the stroller.  May not seem like much now, but will possibly avoid some jealousy he or she may feel...    When ever you can simplify things for yourself please do...  We almost always used two single strollers...|`|Zz3ix3I5aa	I think you should keep the single stoller and buy the double. The single stoller could come to great use one day! Just keep it and wait to see what happens. Congrats on the baby!|`|1dfcb1c1fb22bcf6533c2cd5304c3000aa	You should hold onto your single stroller.  When your oldest gets older and does not or can not use the stroller anymore you still have a stroller for your younger one.|`|ZDGBCE50aa	no not really.Give it away to a needty parent.It will put a smile on their face.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I kept my single stroller after buying a double. Once your oldest is about 3 they will no longer be interested in riding in it. Then you can just dust off that single stroller and start using it again for only your youngest.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I am due 3 days after my firsts 2nd birthday.  I am getting rid of my travel system but hanging onto my chicco light weight single stroller.

Seriously.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Wow, I really doubt it if you were using condoms and birth control pills together and he pulled out while wearing the condom. Is there some reason you think you might be?

467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I would take another HPT. If it says negative I would call your doctor and let them know what is happening. Good Luck!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	That happens when you stop taking the pill. It alters your period so I wouldnt stress it right about now wait another week or so and take another test if it doesnt show and if its still negative you may need to take a trip to the doctor.|`|v3LnJycKaa	You stopped birth control after a year of use, your body maybe readjusting itself, call you primary care and explain the situation and ask if she could do a blood test, i am sure they will have no issue in doing this.|`|NNwEuC8paa	I think that you should go and get blood work done, Birth control makes you pretty fertile so it you just stopped talking it and had sex good chances are you are pregnant. Id wait a few days, then take one first thing in the morning if that still come back negative then go get  blood test. If its not any of that then its prob bc you just stopped taking your pills.! Good luck|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Yake another test if its negative ask for a blood test to be doneM I think you might be pregnant and tested too early|`|uuHPneEcaa	sometimes when u stop taken birth control it can make u skip.. I think u should wait until next month to take another pregnancy test. if ur stressed out about anything that can also cause u to miss a period. <br>  <br>  Birth contol help regulate ur period and it also prevents u from getting pregnant. So if that is what ur doctor told u then u have nothing to worry about.. why did u stop taken ur pill in the 1st place are u trying to get pregnant?<br>  <br>  be calm and I am sure everything will be okay.|`|61e43026c2296d0395ca66a2a1b35b79aa	It doesnt hurt to take a test - both blood and over the counter tests. It has been long enough you should get good results from a HPT, even though family dollar and dollar general home tests are a dollar they have the best sensitivity rating for detecting pregnancy. If you are still not satisfied you should call your doctor and get a test ran that way you can know for sure if you are or not. <br>  Also, remember that sometimes stress and other factors can causes you to be late or miss your period completely even if its never happened before. Not to mention when you stop taking birth control after you have been on it for a while it can often mess up your cycle and it can take up to 3 months to go back to normal so it is VERY possible it is your body readjusting to not having the birth control hormones anymore.|`|a2H0R5GLaa	If you have taken a couple tests already and they have come out negative, I would suggest going to the doctor for a more accurate result.  Your system may just be messed up due to the fact that it is adjusting from not taking your pill last month, but just to be safe I would get another test.  It will make you feel better knowing.  Also, stressing out can cause your period to be late or sometimes not come at all...but being that you are so regular with your time of month, go and get a blood test.  Hope this helps a little...good luck!  :)|`|ARUVea4yaa	Your period will be messed up most likely for a few months. i didn't get my period for 6 weeks after getting off birth control. you can be pregnant but i would guess that it is just you body trying to re-adjust itself to producing hormones by itself now instead of the pill doing that for you|`|Q2IbbjGxaa	if you didn't take your body is use to you taking birth control your period might rely on that to come but i would go to the doctors and find out if you are pregnant or not. they can do a blood test and if that is saying no they might do some tests to figure out why you skipped all together good luck
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	You should try testing on the day  your actual period was suppose to start because what you just had that you think is your "period" could have been implantation bleeding!! this just happened to me i'm due for my period till next wed but i have this weird brown looking blood on monday i'm being told it can be implantation bleeding and it sounds like that's whats happening to you! baby dust to you if you're trying to conceive! =]|`|u2RrglPiaa	possibly you should go to the doctor or try getting a pregnancy test that will let you know for sure.|`|IAzCsvaNaa	you might be. yuo should take a test. i had my period for 3 days last month and im about 3 weeks late already. you should take a test
M5HyStReaa	you need 1000mg of calcium from week 22 onwards. <br>  <br>  Calcium is in green vegetables (not spinach or chard), tofu, broccoli, almonds, beans, grains|`|67QVKHQ3aa	drink alot of OJ it has plenty calcium, you can even get some thats PLUS calcium which just means it has alot more then usuall..oranges obviously are good to!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Obviously milk, cheese, yogurt, icecream & other forms of dairy. Almonds are another good source, so are green leafy veggies and broccoli. You can drink calcium fortified orange juice as well.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You don't need an extra calcium pill. Just take a parental vitamin. It has all the things you need in one pill for a healthy pregnancy. You can get them at the store in the vitamin section. It isn't only calcium you need. The most important thing you can be taking right now during your baby's early development is Folic Acid. It helps reduce the risk of birth defect drastically. This is also in the prenatal vitamin. You can get extra calcium from dairy product like cheese, yogurt, milk, etc. Also from some cereals and breads. The package will say "with calcium" You can google calcium rich foods and get a whole list of them. But you really need to be taking a prenatal vitamin.
eytlIKITaa	It might just be your body getting back into the swing of things after getting off of BC.  I'd wait a week and take another test though.  You never know...  Good luck!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I think it might be the birth control playing around with you. My doc told me it takes about 3months to "clean it out of ur system" and everyting to go back to normal. When I got off bc i would have light periods heavy periods no periods, it was a crazy time for me bc it was making me think i was pregnant. it takes about 3 months to get back to ur normal cycle so more than anything i think it's the birthcontrol you were on messing with your head, bc i was experiencing the same exact things. good luck though and lots of baby dust to you keep trying|`|2WBSyL2Vaa	Go and see your doctor, that kind of sounds like me with my pregnancy now. My first test was negative and the second was positive so I decided to go to my doctor and I am indeed pregnant.

kaqPSgTVaa	She can't get tested until at least 10 days past sex by blood. Most clinics dont' do blood tests either. She would have to go to her normal doctor. If she cant' do that she's going to have to wait until it's been 14 days past sex and take a home pregnancy test to find out.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	When her period is late. Or about 2-3 weeks after she had sex.<br>  I don't see what her age has to do with anything, it's the same for all ages.|`|q8XkxDwCaa	She can try a home pregnancy test as soon as she misses her period.  Although that is what I did and I had SIX negative tests when I was really pregnant!  I didn't test positive until 2 weeks after my missed period.  I think the best thing for her to do would be to go to the doctor or a family planning clinic, those are nice because they cost little or nothing and they are very confidential.  She could get a blood test to find out for sure.  Or wait it out and see if she misses her period before she takes action.  What makes her think she is pregnant?  What are her symptoms?|`|TMuxrQfdaa	Can check right away and most cities have women's heath care clinics|`|9BwY5sA5aa	Clinic

kaqPSgTVaa	Spotting can be very normal. It's best to just take a test if you think you are pregnant.
2irmTjQ3aa	If you are on bc and using a condom you are probably not pregnant. You should call your doctor to figure out why you are missing your period.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	See your doctor for a blood test.|`|kV9YT6bSaa	It sounds like pregnancy, take another test. If it comes back negative again,but still no period, go to your doctor. After being on birth control for a year it shouldn't make you miss periods. And it IS possible to get pregnant with both a condom and birth control, there's just a very slim to none chance. Good luck!|`|KId2K1G4aa	i would say you aren't pregnant. maybe your just going through a stressful time or possibly not eating right or exercising a lot. a lot of different things can mess up a reg. period|`|0sbUJB1Vaa	another test.doctor.

Its the other way around sweetie.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	When you give your baby up for adoption you are not legally or financially responsible for the child any more.|`|HwujORd2aa	Oh what a tough decision to have to make.<br>  You do not help them out financially. The whole point is that they adopt your child and raise it as their own. <br>  Your only responsibility is to be good to your body while you're pregnant so that the baby has its best shot at a healty life as possible. But, that is the case whether you keep the baby or give it up for adoption. <br>  Speak to people in adoption services (google it in your area) and make your decision from there. You might be able to find that your medical expenses get covered and maybe some others too. <br>  Best wishes.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I don't think you have to help them out financially. You are signing your rights over so the adoptive parents will put in all the money for the adoption to take place. May God bless both you and your child.|`|seU9VwIJaa	It's the other way around!

He will lean down.|`|8iewmkjXaa	hell bend down. and u can also go on ur tippy toes lol|`|126fnjTraa	lol jump into his arms and kiss him<br>  <br>  or grow taller :/
JvcJs8k9aa	some people have sex without the intention of getting pregnant (even though they know it is possible). when they do get pregnant and they weren't expecting it, they call it accidental (or unplanned). i think people use accidental and unplanned synonymously|`|pwXK9A4haa	ever hear of a condom breaking? well, if your saying that there are no accidents in this world you might be on to something.|`|yvt0IbqJaa	it could mean that it happened while using birth control, you'd be surprised how much that happens!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In the rare cases in which a woman is on a reliable form of birth control (IUD, shot, pill) and gets pregnant, I would consider that "accidental."|`|YupMCYHlaa	Yes!  Any time you get pregnant without meaning to, that's an accidental pregnancy.  You may not realize it,but MOST of the times people have sex they don't mean to get pregnant.  It is an expression of love and intimacy.  It's very pleasant and enjoyable (in case you never did it). And it's a very basic human need.  It's not JUST for reproduction or for irresponsible, promiscuous people, or drunk or high people.  It's some thing MOST of us do.  If we're lucky enough to have someone wonderful to love.<br>  <br>  Even people who are responsible and monogamous and even MARRIED and who use birth control and get tested for STDs can have accidental pregnancies.  Sheesh!
1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|ZWEmPMsqaa	Smoking could make your baby premature meaning smaller. It increases the chance of having you baby not understand reading skills for school like other babies. It also increases their chance of having them smoke when they grow up. Your affecting your babies lungs and it increases their chance of asthma. Your increasing the chance of cancer for it too. Trust me my dad smokes around me right now ,and I can't breathe normally. My lungs are darkened and right now I guess I'm doing pretty good since I'm in cross country. I could be much faster maybe the fastest of my time if my dad didn't smoke. My mom also did something similar to your idea. My mom drank Pepsi when I was in her stomach so I ended up with rashy skin since my mom drank about nine cans a day. Doing this for you baby try to really quit it. The blood vessels for your baby also gets constricted since ,and it needs oxygen. You reduce the oxygen it gets since smoking stops your breathing first. Your baby can't reach its full potential.(like me) Just these to chemicals nicotine and carbon monoxide cause these. Imagine the other 300 chemicals in one puff of a cigarette would do. Your baby's brain will also be smaller due to your smoking. If you continue your just creating a smoker inside your womb, and when your baby grows up. It will already be addicted to that cigar.
VS8mactUaa	She is 5!!!!!!!! the little girl isnt sitting there trying to have n orgasm, she is just picking around at herself exploring, she doesnt know the purpose of it. Jese. Tell her to grow up, not wanting to touch her child because shes curious. Thats just great. sorry not trying to be rude but, for crying out loud she is her mother!
kaqPSgTVaa	They will but not just because the mother wants it. It's more dangerous to be put under. The drugs they give you can make you really really tired. I was so sleepy I barely remember anything from the surgery.|`|AA10186411	Yes, but normally they won't do it.  Its not good for the baby. Just get the epidural, you won't feel a thing, promise.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	I had an emergency c-section and was put under and don't remember anything from it at all. I was all over the place for 2days cause I had a bad reaction to morphine, I didn't get to see my baby till the third day :(<br>  It is allowed and can be dangerous. <br>  <br>  I got the chose to be put under cause my baby was stable at that stage, I didn't want to stuff around with getting the epidural in and waiting for it to work and have my baby crash again so it was best for me but after was horrible.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Yes, my friend had an emergency c-section due to the umbilical cord being wrapped around her daughters neck and a drop in blood pressure,  and was put to sleep. She then had a son also c-section and said it was much better to be awake because she missed so much the first time.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	I'm pretty sure its only done in special cases.<br>  But the epidural is really great you don't feel any pain whatsoever.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Yep alot of people be put to sleep when performing a c-section|`|6ri7AYC1aa	If it's absolutly necessary then yes.<br>  But their not going to put someone to sleep because the mother wants to.<br>  Most of the time they use an epideral.<br>  Besides it's safer for the baby, and the mother gets to see the baby right after the c-section rather than after they wake up.|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	Most doctor's prefer to do an epidural but if it is an emergency and they don't have time to wait for the epidural to work they will put you to sleep.<br>  It doesn't hurt when you have the epidural your completely numbed before and after.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	I had a c-section,but it was 28 years ago and they did put me to sleep. I believe it can be done with some sort of anesthetic in the abdominal area.|`|BFuBfQOHaa	Definitely, alot of people are put asleep while the c-section is being performed|`|AqcpdB1Raa	yea.  i think it will lessen the pain and u will not know whats going on.
v1IzWlqQaa	I dont believe he is traumatized by this...He will not remember it when he is older He is too young right now...But if it continues after about age 3 he might remember it so maybe you should take some therapy or something to get your anger under control before it gets out of hand.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	Your son will more than likely forget what is going on by tomorrow.  On the other hand, it's not good to do this in front of him.  It sounds like you need stronger medication or maybe a different kind of medication.  I would also suggest some counseling and some alone time for yourself...it would help a lot.  Counseling is worth any price in your situation.<br>  Good luck and take care of yourself...|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Forget the herbal medicine, and talk to a real therapist.  If they haven't helped after a year, there not going to, and a therapist can help because it a real person you can talk out your problems with.|`|K1lRZmxXaa	he is fine he just doesnt want to hear you yell thats all he is traumitized he is just as upset as you are because he sees you mad|`|1zTheHOQaa	I'm sure if you reassure him and still care for him, then he will forget all about sooner than you expect!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|2f187fd461b7b57957cd504ae18cee8eaa	I wouldn't say you traumatized him, but it's defiantly not something you want to keep doing. My parents used to fight and scream and slam doors. It defiantly made an impact on how I felt as an adult. I even remember my father putting his fist threw a wall. The best thing is to see your doctor and perhaps a therapist that can just listen to you. It will release all that tension before you take it out on your son. Be careful with taking herbal supplements too. Most of the time they haven't been regulated and too much or too little can be a bad thing..  Good luck!|`|iQcd37Goaa	i know how you feel i'm with my 9 week old 24/7 and it feels like it gets harder than easy..when she cries and i feel like screaming i walk out of the room and breath for 5 min and that helps me but i'm guilty of have yelling to..all i know is that everything you feel your baby does to so try to feel better and i don't think he'll be scarred for life just love him and he'll forget but you need to feel better..do it for him if you need anything else i'm here!good luck|`|KICQQxLxaa	He will probably not be scarred for life, but you need to regain control of yourself.  I totally understand PPD, but it doesn't sound like you have it fully under control.<br>  <br>  "Herbs"  may not help with PPD.  Are you seeing a counselor or someone who gave you the *herbs*??  You  may need to find someone to talk to, or look at taking anti-depressants.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Are you pregnant? It's not something that's commonly associated with pregnancy, but you're in the preg section. <br>  <br>  Sort of sounds like a yeast infection. Maybe you have an infection of some sort.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I wonder if someone will make a joke about the closing your legs bit... ahh I'm sorry hun I've never heard of these symptoms being associated with pregnancy, I'd definitely get yourself checked out.|`|etUFe6tJaa	When you say you are 15 weeks I assume you mean you are 15 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  It could mean a few things, the one I can think of is possibly a UTI or some sort of infection with your down-there bits.  The only way to get it sorted out is to get a medical doctor to look at it.  I know it is embarrassing but it has to be done just to be sure.  Especially if you are pregnant - infections shouldn't be treated lightly.  <br>  <br>  However it could just be something very simple like an allergy to something you are using (eg.  washing powder, underwear material etc).<br>  Get it checked out!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i have cramps in my stomach but never pains down in the area your talking about. you should inform your parents and let them help you make the decision if you need to go to the doctor. but since your so young your going to have a high risk pregnancy and the doctor is going to need to know everything about your pregnancy including your pains just to make sure you have a healthy baby.
MMF1YmZZaa	Well, if your doctor is worried then of course I would worry. I've only heard of this happening with people who were overweight to begin with, so I don't really know, but good luck nonetheless and I hope everything is OK!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's not a lot of weight and if your doctor is concerned then I would be a little concerned too. Try eating fattier foods that contain more calories. Eat more frequent small meals as well.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	DO NOT EAT HIGH FAT CALORIE FOODS. Try eating healtier more nutritious foods and ask your doctor what he reccommends. It is not about how much you eat but what you are eating.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Since your doctor is worried I would be too. Have they done tests on the baby since it's measuring small? Try eating more frequent meals, and drinking lot's of milk.
MMF1YmZZaa	I would definitely take a test. By my calculations, you are about 8 days late if you have a normal 28 day cycle. I knew I was pregnant about two weeks before my missed period due to SORE breasts, and I had a strange discharge, if I had some between my fingers, it would almost pat down, like a paste (TMI, sorry but you asked!). I was also nauseated by any smell in the morning. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I would take a test<br>  That is the only way to know<br>  <br>  If you get a negative test, and still not period, take a see a doctor for a blood test<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Yes you could be pregnant, take a test|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That doesn't mean 100% that you are pregnant. You should take a pregnancy test though. That's the only way to know for sure.|`|fzjePK5Haa	You can take a pregnancy test if your period is late. You can also look for early symptoms of pregnancy...some of which show you within a few days of conception. <br>  I found this site very useful. <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recognize-pregnancy-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670544_recogniz...</a>|`|v3MqaYJIaa	maybe is a bit late<br>  <br>  and if you banged some one around that time just to be safe take a you sude take a pregnancy test|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Everyone is different and there isn't any way for us to know so wait a few days and take a test!|`|FcHyam0eaa	Well, I know that you have probably heard that "Oh, well, that means your pregnant, and blah blah blah". And the only way to know is if <br>  you buy a pregnancy test and it is positive. That is unless you're still living under your parents roof and you would cant beat if they found you with those!!! Just wait until, you start to feel kicking, see a bump, and until you get weird cravings, because those occur early in pregnancy, I remember because when I was pregnant I had cravings in the first month. So I would go to the free clinic or something if I were you. I really hope that this helped you!<br>  - Best wishes!!|`|1eZyroqdaa	The first few weeks of waiting to find out can drive a girl in sane. My boobs being sore was the first sign of pregnancy, even when the home tests showed negative. (about 4-5 weeks). Home pregnancy test should almost be showing by now. I know you are probably eager to know but unfortunately sometimes we just have to wait and see.
1oeDBTe9aa	for me, the earliest signs were sore breasts.  and i swear i thought my nipples were getting bigger.<br>  <br>  and yes, i did have spotting.  i thought i was having my period, but it only lasted for a couple hours.  i had no idea that i was pregnant, and didnt even suspect it. [my period was always weird and irregular]|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Early signs of pregnancy are the same as signs of your period coming, sore breasts, cramping, bloating, mood swing, and even head aches. Only about 20% of women have any bleeding during pregnancy from conception to birth, I never spotted.|`|96HWpdkFaa	My first sign was sore breasts.<br>  And nope I never had spotting after conception.<br>  <br>  Actually only about 30% of woman actually do.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Earliest signs would be:<br>  fatigue<br>  nausea/throwing up<br>  beelding of the guns<br>  gas<br>  food cravings and/or aversions<br>  fuller boobs, extra sensitive nipples, prominent veins<br>  runny or stuffed nose for no reason<br>  mood swings<br>  cramping<br>  backaches<br>  headaches<br>  All much like PMS<br>  and then of course a missed period.<br>  Some woman get spotting, but every woman is different, even pregnancy to pregnancy.<br>  Good luck!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My first symptoms were like my normal PMS symptoms so I thought I hadn't gotten lucky that month and I started getting them about 7 days after when I think I concieved. Not everyone gets early symptoms though. It's actually not that common to have implantation bleeding. Only about 20% of women get it.|`|QSodlfMraa	missed period, not all women have spotting.|`|hORVMOHKaa	my first sign was extreme fatigue and not all women have spotting after conception, i didnt
vygYFdsSaa	No, implantation bleeding doesn't occur in everyone. I never had any spotting for instance. Earliest symptom is usually tender breasts followed by an increase in your urination frequency. Good luck|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You don't get spotting after conception, but over a week later when the fertilized egg attaches.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	spotting is extremely RARE|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Here are the earliest signs of pregnancy:<br>  swollen/sore breasts<br>  cramping from implantation of the egg<br>  more frequent urination<br>  constipation<br>  and you may notice some bloating<br>  <br>  other than that, nausea and the morning sickness TYPICALLY shows up around 4+ weeks.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	It is different for everyone.  Just take the test and you won't have to guess.  Some women don't get any signs.|`|35kVNi5oaa	yeh, i spotted.|`|q4JMjvGLaa	Speaking from experience, the earliest signs of pregnancy I had were lack of appetite, breast pain (like shooting pains), cramps like my period was going to come, and emotional ups and downs. I did not get spotting after conception but I did experience implantation cramps about 5-6 days after the day I conceived!|`|VAZvvUEzaa	The earliest sign is increase in breast size, followed by nausea/vomiting, headaches, dizziness and slight weight gain. As for spotting, or implantation bleeding, it can happen, though not always with everyone. I did, but it was very small. If it's minor, it's normal. If it's very heavy, or lasts a long time, you should see your doctor.|`|npEv0Irwaa	well every pregnancy is different babe not all pregnancy are the same. in some you could get morning sickness and the other you don't and spotting is normal but if like a period then no its not normal that means your having a miscarriage which is not good...|`|749a472d80ff6b3462df8579bf6f6d67aa	I don't think everyone spots. I did with three out of my four kids. The earliest indicators are nausia to certain smells, dizzy spells, and lack of appetite (contrary to the myth that woman start wanting to eat like crazy)|`|ojHVod5uaa	Every woman is different,but for me all I had was fatigue and a racing heart, I did not spot at all. I think that is about 50/50 for most women|`|PCbY5pSfaa	sore breasts, fatigue, frequent headaches, and peeing alot.|`|0dad3b5bffeb27a4c94a574078acee75aa	yea dalmations are constantly pregnant
HFKVREiUaa	i see it, very weird tho, maybe it is a mirror image of the baby, i would take the picture and show your doctor at your ext visit.good luck.|`|OiFNZnwOaa	no there would be 2 heart beats or and echo fo a heartbeat...<br>  it is just like when you look at the clouds you can see things like faces, animals, etc..thats why u can see a face in the 3d..<br>  it does kind of look like a face, but trust me its not :-)|`|CKnHMYHnaa	No way. The trained tech would have noticed another life in your womb. You are only having one baby.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Spotting is referring to a very small amount of blood. Have you ever thought your period was over to wake up a few days later to see that you have a small amount of blood when you wipe after going to the bathroom? That's the amount it is.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	If you are seeing alot of blood during your pregnancy then you need to call your doctor. I didn't spot at all until I was 30 weeks pregnant and my doctor told me that I needed to take it easy. <br>  <br>  Call the doctor if you see any kind of spotting just to be on the safe side. Better to be safe than sorry.|`|O0PfwDJeaa	I had brown spotting from 4 weeks to 5 weeks.  It showed up on the toilet paper every time I used the bathroom (which was frequently).   <br>  I started spotting pinkish-red from 7 - 8 weeks, and once again it was every time I used the bathroom.<br>  <br>  My pregnancy proceeded normally, and my little girl is 10 weeks old now.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I spotted earlier in my pregnancy when I was about 4 weeks to 7 weeks pregnant then it stopped.  I spotted again a week ago after being intimate and freaked out, but the doctor says it is okay because the cervix is full of vessels so it can easily bleed.  I am 14 weeks and a half.  No spotting now.  Best of luck.|`|tZ1XPd1paa	I spotted for 3 nights when I was seven weeks pregnant. I was so scared, because I had a miscarriage a few months prior. The dr said light pink spotting is normal (which is what I had) as long as it doesn't get darker (bright red) or have severe cramping.|`|UzMcNOCRaa	a little bit, <br>  usually pink in color. <br>  it can happen at any time during , but its common in the first three months.|`|K1lRZmxXaa	You are not supposed to spot but some people do but i will still go see a doctor just incase
O0PfwDJeaa	I didn't have ANY symptoms at all!  No nausea, no morning sickness, nothing!   My pregnancy went so smoothly, no complications at all!  I felt great, no swelling, not much weight gain, etc.<br>  <br>  I was truly worried at first too thinking I had to feel miserable for things to progress well.  My doctor assured me that was NOT the case and told me to just be thankful and enjoy the easy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  My little girl is 10 weeks old now and as healthy as can be :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There is no rule that you have to have every symptom of pregnancy or that you have to have any. I'm pregnant with my second and have had no morning sickness like I did with my first. You are fine.|`|qtA5oCeAaa	yes its fine that means your one of the lucky ones so enjoy it just because you dont feel pregnant dosent mean your not|`|ynjgq4GZaa	It's ok, and I hope you don't get sick!  But I should warn you, 5 weeks is early and it's very possible you could get morning sickness later.  I got it at 6 weeks myself.  Hope you are luckier than me!!
WPI0Z47saa	An ultrasound would be able to tell the difference. Your baby can turn upside down and feel like it is low early but this does not mean that it is coming. It is probably in a weird position causing you discomfort but that happens sometimes. My son was upside down and in position when I was 28 weeks and he wasn't delivered until 37 weeks and that was induced because I had high blood pressure. My co worker had the baby's head lodged in the birth canal for 2 months before he came and he ended up being 2 weeks late.|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	If you've had an ultrasound the tech should have gotten measurements. And most likely those should be accurate|`|1eZyroqdaa	If you had an ultrasound then it should be fairly accurate. Is this your first baby? I felt like all of mine were about to fall out at any moment and each pregnancy gets worse. I am now pregnant with number 4 (25weeks) and feel like i could deliver any day, maybe its just the excitement for it to hurry up and happen combined with all the heaviness of carrying a baby. after all it is hard work.
uFrqC4Y2aa	That's very weird. I've never heard that before. If you have a positive result then you have enough HcG (pregnancy hormone) in your body to produce the positive result. Go to the doctor immediately if you are having your period.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I would take another test just to make sure. A pregnanty test looks for  a hormone that is only presnent when pregnant and it would not of said positive unless you had that hormone in you. Take another test it could be faulty or you could be preggers. God Bless|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, if the test was positive, you're likely pregnant. Some women have a period-like discharge the first month of pregnancy, or some have it all through pregnancy, but a positive test means you have the pregnancy hormone in your urine, nothing else causes a positive.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	If you got a positive test result, then you are pregnant...there is no such thing as a false positive. If you started bleeding, then that could be a miscarriage, or you are having a period while pregnant. You didn't say if it was a lot of blood or not, but either way I would go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
uFrqC4Y2aa	You should find out if you are pregnant and consult your doctor if you are.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You do get increased blood flow in pregnancy BUT you have really poor circulation in pregnancy. I've been pregnant twice and both times my doctors warned me of this. My limbs fall asleep quicker than normal.|`|ZQ8GvmZwaa	Pregnancy, generally, is a weird condition. It makes our health issues either worst or better. You can never tell. If you are pregnant, the blood amount that is in the cycle increases, so it can help with your circulation. Also, this condition may change a couple of times during pregnancy. I wish that you are pregnant, and as long it will be confirmed by your doctor, you must discuss this issue with him!<br>  Good luck!!|`|vygYFdsSaa	As someone with no medical degree, this explanation makes sense to me. Most of the increased blood flow in pregnancy goes to your uterus however. Definitely check with your doctor, that would be great if pregnancy cleared up your symptoms! Is this a good time for a pregnancy for you?|`|ki3XY49daa	While I'm not a doctor, it is totally plausible to think that could be possible.  Your blood volume more than doubles in pregnancy.  The increase in blood flow is immediate after the egg implants too.  I would ask my doctor, but it seems totally possible.
1k6UUC8qaa	an iud she could have only gotten from her doctor an iud is just that they just come from different manufacturer and some differ in shape but the purpose is the same birth control.. she could be feeling sick from the lack of hormones she is no longer taking.  iud like the pill is not 100%. she can feel discomfort from having it on its not for everyone she could be sore.  having that thingamajig inside there is no picnic its like when you get braces.  since its not 100% there is a risk of pregnancy but a normal pregnancy is not what you should worry about with an iud is an ectopic pregnancy that its a pregnancy in the Fallopian tube and it can be dangerous,  you should be more worried about your girlfriends health that if she gets pregnant.  it she still feeling sick she should go back to her doctor hopefully everything is ok he should answer why she is still in pain|`|xhT8bJeHaa	Well I was on Mirena for a while but then I fell and it moved. I didn't know I could get pregnant because it was out of place so know i have a daughter. But if you don't trust it 100% then use condoms most of the time or until you feel more comfortable.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	hate to make you worry but I am currently 12 weeks pregnant with a Mirena in place that can not be removed. So I am now a high risk pregnancy.<br>  On the other hand, the Mirena does have side effects that are very similar to that of pregnancy.Her symptoms sound a lot like the side effects of just the Mirena. Also once you have your Mirena for a few months or so you can just stop getting your period all together. She needs to go to the doctor to ensure it is properly placed, if it is then her likely hood of getting pregnant is only about .01%. Mine became embedded and that how I got pregnant. This is alot more common then the doctors will admit. Take a test about 3 weeks after it is time for her period to start if it does not come.
WPI0Z47saa	You only have a 25% chance of becoming pregnant each month even under perfect conditions meaning that you had sex at the tme of ovulation. 2 months is nothing. It takes most healthy couples up to 6 months and some even 1 year. You just have to be patient. Have sex every 2-3 days to guarantee that you don't miss ovulation and that is all that you can do.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	dont get up right after sex <br>  tilt your hips up <br>  have sex every day of the week <br>  take prenatal vitamins <br>  loose some weight if you are on the heavy side <br>  and if after a year you are not pregnant consult a doctor|`|QSodlfMraa	IVF but thats is very costy, so your best bet is sex.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	There really is nothing you can do but to make sure that you are having sex when you ovulate. You can have sex till the cows come home but if you aren't ovulating you aren't going to get pregnant.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You're both young, so continue having sex. You can consult a doctor to tell you how to maximize your efforts in having a child. It shouldn't be too hard since you are in your early 20s. <br>  <br>  Keep trying.|`|56MmKc5caa	This website has some tips check it out and good luck to you and your man.<br>  <a href="http://www.having-a-baby.com/millenium.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.having-a-baby.com/millenium.h...</a>|`|kN4EaiUDaa	start taking prenatal vitamins now before you get pregnant. figure out when your ovulation stage is and the days your ovulating have sex atleast once a day. but dont have more sex than once a day to every other day. the more your husband gets off and cums his sperm count will lower. so no craziness like sex 2-4 times a day because that will actually hurt your chances. missionary is the best sex position for sex and have your legs up in the air, then after sex lay on your back with your legs up in the air so its easier for ther sperm to travel up and dont go the restroom for about 10mins after sex. also you might go to the doctor just to get a check up to make sure every matches up and make sure your healthy to care a baby|`|MRV9rNyjaa	my cousin went to the drs to find out "what is wrong with her" but any ways, he had her keep track of her temp, and they were on drs orders to have sex every day. well he told her that when her temp spikes that means that she is ovulating, and if it stays up that means you did the job. worked for her.|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	Well, of course, there are those very expensive medical treatments that can get you pregnant! But if you're like me and can't afford those, you have to go the old fashion route, haha. <br>  <br>  I'm starting to think that sex doesn't even cause pregnancy! lol
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	No. We also have to [pay for health insurance in an antiquated, republican-driven monopoly.<br>  If you want more money, get a job. If you want free health care, vote against the Republicans.|`|KICQQxLxaa	No.  There is nothing like that in the United States.<br>  <br>  You can however claim your child on your income taxes and recieve a deduction on your taxes.  Your child had to be born by 12-31-08 to qualify for your 2008 taxes.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, there is no child subsidy of that type in the U.S.  Depending on income, you may be eligible for WIC, welfare or food stamps.|`|AA12074269	You cant compare different government (countries) subsidies.<br>  <br>  The Australia allowance is 5K for the baby at birth but is income adjusted - there is a small benefit per fortnight (nothing like 1K more like 2K per year) but that is also income adjusted.<br>  <br>  In the US you get a tax deduction for "things" you donate - not in Australia you dont. In the US poor get food stamps - in Australia you dont - different countries allocate their welfare in different ways|`|7Io72XtQaa	In Australia we get a baby bonus, it is $5000 and we get it in fortnightly payments of about $385... it is also means tested, meaning you have to prove that in the first 6 months of the baby born you and your partner will not receive an income of more than $75,000 combined. I dont know where you got the information about Australia getting $1000 or more a month!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Nope. There's no information to get. Unfortunately we don't get anything for one of the hardest jobs around.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I live in Canada and its not $1000 a month for one child.  We get a monthly baby bonus depending on your income that ranges from $50 to $400 per child, plus there is a childcare benefit of $100 per month for each child under the age of 6 (its meant to help with the cost of daycare) and another one that has something to do with having a kid in daycare which is around $25/month (some people may get more, that's what I get because I have no daycare costs).<br>  Unfortunately there isn't any thing like this in the US.|`|TJusfEnlaa	Casey - if u are a single parent you get up to $900 a fortnight - plus rent assistance.<br>  If you are low income you still get about $300 a f/n.<br>  I had our son last year when the baby bonus wasnt means tested (my fiance is a high income earner) and we recieved $4100 in a lump sum.<br>  In australia we have centrelink... do you have anything like that in America? If so I am sure they have a hotline or a website where you can get some info.|`|3Fq0HaIAaa	Nope. Australia does it, I don't know about Canada, but the US doesn't. In France the government even sends a nanny to help you.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Sorry, there isn't.  My husband and I are both college students, and we can't get any help from the government.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Nada, Zip, Ziltch.|`|a03a43bb5a9fa8406b5e2c0effe464beaa	move
uFrqC4Y2aa	The ultrasound can determine the conception date and how far along you are.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most likely around then. There is absouletly NO WAY of knowing 100% when you concieved though. None. Sorry. :) It's just a good estimated guess.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	The conception date is at best an educated guess, there will be no way to say for sure 100% exactly when you conceived., just a close proximity.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	yeah they are usually accurate within 2 or 3 days when you get one done that early.

etUFe6tJaa	Sorry - but I don't think you are over-reacting.<br>  <br>  The fact that you two are to become parents in a little less than 4.5 months time means it is time for him to get his act together and be responsible.  There is going to be so much more he needs to be a part of once the baby is here.  I am not saying that for both of you partying days are over - because even parents needs a break now and then - but it is definitely going to be very limited.  <br>  <br>  You really need to sit him down and talk to him.  Parenthood is a big deal, he sounds to me he is not with it and at the moment you really need somebody who can be there for you and support you in a positive way. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|hORVMOHKaa	i feel alone during my pregnancy also... my husbands in Iraq and its hards not having him here. I feel your pain!|`|MRV9rNyjaa	i dont think you are over reacting at all. you have every right to want him around and be apart of this. hell he helped create this baby. im so glad i have my husband, he wants to spend time with me and man, i sometimes have to tell him go out to the bar.and sometimes i will go with him. but not that often. dont feel too comfy at the bar, being 33 wks.but it is nice knowing that i am his dd, and that he will get home safe, and just to get out of the house once in a while.|`|oM3vGG2Waa	NO, not at all. Even though its hard to get through to father-to-be's some times because theyre not going through what you're going through and what we're feeling he should always be there for you and your (incoming) baby.<br>  <br>  honestly though, the fact that he wasnt around his ex-wife's pregnancy plus he didnt stick around for her should've been a warning to you. :S you should really think about your situation and whats best for your baby. good luck honey.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	Same here ... but the worse part about my boyfriend is he has been promissing me to get a apartment and he still hasnt and im due in couple of weeks , I cant work and he thinks im lazy and i cant do anything for myself he calls me names all the time , and what a problem i am to his life ! he partys anytime he wants to go out and dosnt consider taking me to a damn movie or out to eat. <br>  <br>  I dont know what to do i jus wished he wasnt the fatherof my child ! honestly|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	He shouldn't be drinking at all, he is about to become a father and you are pregnant, since you can't drink, he should be supporting you by doing the same. He should also be at home with you and NEVER out at the bars by himself, how despicable.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm going through the same thing. My husband parties all the time, but whenever I tell him I don't want him to he always does it anyways. I think that it is disrespectful. But he doesn't seem to care. We have a limited income also and he seems to make us have to worry about money every month. He just tells me not to worry, but I have to cuz if I don't then we would be in debt. Where do you live?|`|G9TocOkAaa	you're married to a drunk...don't expect him to change. the girl who said she feels your pain because her husband is in iraq...that is totally different. her husband is away for a legitimate reason...yours is not.<br>  i was married to a paratrooper in the 182nd airborne division when i was pregnant with my first child. he was away because he was in the service...that i could deal with.<br>  with my second husband, an abusive drunk, he was out all night doing God knows what.  he was not protecting our country.<br>  your husband will change, he will get worse.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i think bars and drinking are a bad idea once people get married anyways. because "accidents" can happen when your really drunk. so if the drinking stops it elimates the chance of him possibly getting so drunk he cheats on you with out thinking clearly. but he needs to quit the partying. he's a father already and now has a wife and another baby on the way. its time for him to grow up and his weeknights and weekend should now be filled with taking the kids to the zoo, watching spongebob on t.v. all day, and being a family man. if he wasnt ready to grow up then he shouldnt be getting people pregnant. if he doesnt stop you may have to seperate until he does. because thats unhealthy for your baby to be around a drunk of a dad|`|uGqYoZNEaa	You have every right to be upset.  Did he leave his wife when she was pregnant?  He sounds very immature.  You needt o make sure he knows that he has 2 kids that he needs to be more responsible for.  He' snot gonna change cos there's a new baby in his life.    Put your foot down now, bcos you'r enot gonna feel much better after you give birth and there's no one there to help with a newborn.  If it's you rincome too, you tell him to stop.  IF he doesn't you should seriously consider leaving him.
iPsFTNivaa	If you don't want to take a hpt for fear of another negative, try this:  Take your temperature first thing in the morning with a basal body thermometer.  Don't even get out of bed before you take it.  If your temperature is 98.0 or higher, then I would recommend taking a pregnancy test.  I would kill to be in your shoes!!  I've been ttc for almost 2 years with no success.  So, embrace this and good luck!  Baby dust to you!  :)
WPI0Z47saa	Have you seen a fertility doctor yet?|`|fzjePK5Haa	I found this site very useful in knowing how to track ovulation to get pregnant. Good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4670536_track-ovulation-pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4670536_track-ov...</a>|`|iPsFTNivaa	Why does everyone have to suggest fertility treatment right off the bat?!!  There is a book you should read to help you in getting pregnant.  It is called "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler.  This book is incredible!  It teaches you how to chart your basal body temperature and how to check your cervical mucus.  Both of those techniques will aid you in determining your most fertile time.  There could be one of any number of reasons you're not getting pregnant and this book will help you determine that reason.  It will save you time, money and unnecessary invasive procedures that fertility doctors would put you through.  Please read the book before you go see a fertility doctor.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	i would consider seeing a fertility dr.. sorry thats the best bet i could say..  sorry i wish you luck
oM3vGG2Waa	yes, sperm can stay in your system up to a week.<br>  <br>  Having sex while you have your period isn't very good for you either. There's a chance you can get UTI.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Only if you're under 18, unmarried and not actively trying to conceive.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	sure can!|`|FeEU1IDOaa	No. You can only get pregnant during the time of ovulation, which usually occurs 10-14 days before your period, not during it. There has to be an egg there in order for one to get fertilized. Eggs aren't released during your period, therefore, you won't get pregnant if you're on your period. <br>  <br>  ETA: I'm astonished at the amount of "yes" answers I'm seeing here. Don't listen to them, please. We have all been taught for years that you have to have an egg to concieve a baby. Google it, look it up, ask your Mom - eggs come during ovulation, NOT during menstruation!|`|Hqkrg4Vqaa	yes|`|hORVMOHKaa	yep you sure can
Syvig9Q9aa	umm lady......<br>  <br>  you're too controlling.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Look its just music. Most kids I know, don't actually listen to what the "words are telling them to do" Yeah teenagers get influenced by almost everything around them, but jeez it isn't that bad. Unless he's doing what the lyrics intend...than whatever he listens to shouldn't be a problem unless he BLASTS the music and you don't like hearing it.|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	well i don't think its that big of a deal. why don't you listen to some of the songs? and really there's nothin you can change,. i mean he'll find a way to listen to it anyway if he likes them.. i'm pretty sure you listened to stuff your parents didn't like|`|01Mu3wUeaa	How do you know they are pretty bad if you don't know anything about the music?<br>  <br>  Don't judge the music just because they are heavy metal and such.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go check them out on the net.Look up the lyrics to the bands he likes and see what they are.Its possibly that he doesn't even know what the lyrics are..that he could just like the music.I have met  a lot of people who have no clue what the lyrics mean even if they sing them! lol.<br>  <br>  For example..."Master of Puppets" by Metallica is really about drug use.Some just think the song is bad *** yet they have no clue they are singing about drugs.<br>  <br>  <br>  I listen to a lot of hard rock/heavy metal but stick to songs that have real meaning.I am out of my "hate the world, **** everyone else" faze lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look up the lyrics and judge them from yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tWePoJYNaa	Yeah, we all went through bad band phases. You can't force him to listen to "better" music. My advice is that you play "good" music that you like in the house a lot. My parents always played music in the kitchen while I was growing up. It influenced my taste. Although it's not just limited to that music, I have a place for it. I admit, I'm not too fond of your son's taste in music either, but really there isn't much you can do. It's his taste in music! I guarantee though, he won't always like that music.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Did Your  parents understand YOUR Tastes in Music ?!  :)  EVERY Generation has this SAME complaint... -And Somehow, those kids "grow up" to ask the SAME Question you are !!! YOU were only "16"- for a very short time (although I BET it seemed LONGER- AT the time,,, :)  ), & then your Interests went on to Other things... The same WILL happen to your Son... Music is an expression & celebration of Independence... Let your Son enjoy HIS- before the Time comes when He will have no other Choice...  :)|`|qQSbdcVYaa	They're a christian band. I love them.|`|eISzHe5maa	You shouldn't do anything. The genre of music is fine and the band is just fine too (though I was disappointed seeing them live, not the best show). Maybe you don't like his taste of music but that's not something to punish him for or anything like that. We all have our different tastes after all.<br>  <br>  It's not going to cause him to be violent or angry or whatever you might think. Music doesn't cause people to be violent or bad or misbehave people cause themselves to misbehave. He might get a little hyperactive because of the energy flowing through the music but other than that nothing. <br>  <br>  I mean if you want to talk to him about his musical taste go ahead maybe try and get a better understanding of why he likes the music he likes. If he's playing it too loudly or something along the lines of that have him turn the volume down or even get him some headphones or something.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you really have nothing to worry about.|`|DqUf3LM8aa	Maybe you shouldn't look through his things.  If you didn't even notice this stuff until you went snooping, it's obviously not a big deal.  If you say something or try to change him, he will only rebel against you and listen to the music in secret.  Musical taste is not something you can change, and while you may personally have different taste, the type of music one listens to is not going to be harmful.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, As I Lay Dying probably took their name from the William Faulkner novel of the same name... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying_(novel)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dy...</a>|`|eRrKz3WHaa	honestly, you need to stop.<br>  <br>  your son is listening the music he wants to listen too..you telling him not to listen to it wont stop him. you need to let him enjoy it and show him you care enough to let him do what he wants, maybe listen to a few songs w/ him. tell him how you feel and let him tell you how he feels about what your saying<br>  <br>  just because it has "excessive screaming and heavy drums" doesnt mean its bad. your just rejecting it because its not your style, or something your unfamiliar with<br>  <br>  its honestly not that big of a deal, this is how your son wants to be then let him be that way.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	Ask him about it. Listen to some of it with him. My son listens to some really strange stuff but he explained it to me. He likes shock opera - that it heavy metal music in a shocking video that's part of a larger story. On the face of it some of it is pretty disgusting but if you understand it in the larger context of the storyline it actually makes some sense. Except GWAR. GWAR is obscene no matter what. Talk to your kid.|`|FiUprYsvaa	You should do absolutely nothing.<br>  Its music. <br>  <br>  Unless he is mimicking the lyrics in his behavior, do nothing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some adults listen to country music, they dog doesn't die, their truck is just fine and their wives aren't going to leave them. <br>  <br>  I've listened to the song I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry and I don't want to kiss girls.|`|nTSjPOYQaa	Ah sweet that band is rad. Your son has good taste in music. <br>  <br>  But really, this is a battle you can't win. Heavy metal doesn't mean your kind is doing drugs, or pillaging villages, or murdering people, or worshiping the devil. Just remember, the way Elvis would dance used to be considered super provocative. Music is just a creative outlet. Leave your boy alone!|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Let him listen. He likes it. As long as he isn't blasting it super loud. Let him at it. My parents let me listen to whatever I want. It's not a big deal.|`|PuQ0rIKWaa	Your son is trying to express himself. I'm 13. I went through a phase like this too. First off, the band name has nothing to do with anything. I know it references to dieing, but there are a lot of bands with obscure names out there and they're still great. My dad used to put this look on his face when i listened to "The All-American Rejects" He wanted me to listen to The Greatful dead and The Rolling Stones. I still like them, but i believe the reason that he listens to these bands is for the lyrics(vocals) When i liked screamo, and i still sort of do(that would be the genre of music with heavy guitar, drums and screaming vocals) i listed to it because i felt i could relate to the lyrics. He's just trying to be himself and fit in in this messed up world we have today. If you really want to do something about it the only thing you can do is talk to him. I suggest not trying to change his mind though. It will most likely start an argument.|`|8oCjcS1Raa	music isn't a bad way to express himself<br>  he could be a drug addict, he could cut himself, or get someone pregnant.... but music is perfectly fine<br>  and it's TERRIBLE that you're going through his computer, even if you paid for it. it doesn't matter if by law it's your property, you're invading his privacy.<br>  especially if he's 16, he deserves some privacy, but if you become some crazy control freak (and it sounds like you're pretty much there), then he's gonna start doing everything i mentioned above.<br>  if he listened to a bunch of african bongo drums and wooden flutes, i'm 99% sure that it would be VERY different from your music, but would you not let him listen to that? just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad.<br>  ethnocentrism: when one uses the standard of their own culture to judge other cultures<br>  you're using your own standards of your own music to judge his music, much like ethnocentrism<br>  let him be who he wants to be, get off his computer, leave him alone.<br>  unless you want him to turn out a problem child, you have to let him have some freedom<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  did you think your parents let you have enough freedom?<br>  bet not. that's where you get it from, and i really hope he doesn't turn out like you.<br>  <br>  harsh but true!<br>  <br>  ü|`|SX9zoVEQaa	I was never into heavy metal or "gangsta rap"  More of a classic rock person myself.<br>  <br>  Honestly, parents have been freaking out over their kid's taste in music for generations, just like the boomer parents freaked out over Elvis and the Beatles.  <br>  <br>  As long as there are no explicit lyrics or curses, and he doesn't blast the music in your house giving the entire family headaches, then I would leave it be.  It could be a phase he's going through, or simply his taste in music.  <br>  <br>  p.s.  Make sure his headphones/earbuds aren't too loud!  It can lead to hearing loss as he gets older.|`|IgvrguCVaa	jus ask him why he likes that band...if the reasons are concerniin then leave it alone...evryone has different taste in music|`|sz6dK8uraa	Nothing...<br>  He is expressing himself in a fine way. He could be doing drugs and getting girls pregnant.|`|0v55bQT1aa	Oh please, don't you remember dancing to Madonna, Wham! or Rod Stewart? Come on, get real ! We were 16 one time too !
WPI0Z47saa	Your friends can't make you more fertile and you can't catch pregnancy. Yes birth control can fail and if you are that afraid then double up, pill and condom or don't have sex.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pregnancy isn't contagious honey....|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Haha, it's not contagious or anything, stop freaking out. If you are really concerned about getting pregnant, then use two forms of birth control just to decrease your chances of getting pregnant even more. My husband and I used birth control pills plus condoms for 8 years with no incident.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Instead of freaking out and stressing your body out. Just refrain from sex for a while. If your bf loves you, he will understand. This way there's no way you can get pregnant. If you don't want to do this, then just keep track of your cycles, use condoms and the pill at all times and don't have sex without both. That way you're extra protected. Don't sit and fret about this when I'm sure you have more to worry about. I wish you luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Use protection and you have less of a chance of getting pregnant.|`|35kVNi5oaa	just keep having safe sex|`|8IrIYPBAaa	well if your that scared then stop having sex..or stick with the birth control..you know what could happen though if you continue having sex..but that's a risk everyone takes i guess..|`|Syvig9Q9aa	RUN FOREST RUN. RUN FOR THE HILLS.|`|b71c169159c624e3cafc9d89d4bf9584aa	Look, just refrained from sex before marraige and you will have no fear.|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	okay, having pregnant people around you does not make you more fertile. there isn't anything in the 'water' or other such nonsense. <br>  <br>  and yes, ppl do get pregnant while on the pill...it's not 100%. no form of birth control is 100% - only complete abstinence...<br>  <br>  and you still should be using condoms, even with your bf. combining dual forms of birth control is much more effective, not to mention the safety factor. diseases are spread right and left, and the pill cannot stop you from getting sick. pls play safe!!

CdJtH0xdaa	Teenagers should have to work for what they have and what they want. If they want a car, get a job and save up some money to lease a car. I don't understand why some teenagers have life handed to them on a silver platter, and are showered with stuff they don't need, while others work and work and work to be successful and for stuff they actually NEED. I just don't understand it, honestly.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Very strangely worded question.<br>  I think you mean "what do you think of 16 yr olds with rich parents who are spoiled?"<br>  I dislike them.<br>  I think nothing of 16 yr olds who have parents that buy them nice, expensive cars...<br>  I think everyone's first care should be nice and safe, if the money is available.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: seems like the only right answer is a hateful one along the lines of "i hate those spoiled brats". Sounds more like jealousy than concern|`|HOdblqIkaa	first of all let me say that when i was 16 i was one of those kids who got a nice car. but that aside i dont agree that a child should just be handed the keys to a new car without proving something first. my parents decided to give me a car because i passed drivers ed, i held a steady job since i was 14 and i got decent grades. my younger sister didnt have to do anything to get a new car it was just my parents decision to get her one. at the time i didnt think it was fair but i couldnt do anything about it, it wasnt my decision it was my parents, i turned 16 in 2006 and my first car was a 2006, my sister turned in 2007 and her car was a 2004, so i did get the nicer car. for me i guess its up to the parents if they want to buy their kid a car. one thing i saw alot in high school were kids getting a new car for their birthday then crashing it on purpose to get a new car in the summer and i hated that. it was so pointless.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Hm, well, must be nice.<br>  <br>  Ahem.<br>  <br>  LOL.<br>  <br>  Naw.  If the kid deserves it - gets good grades, stays out of trouble, helps around the house, etc. - and the family can afford it, why not?  It's the 16th bday.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	i hate them!<br>  <br>  probably because i dont have a car...<br>  <br>  but still, one of my friends is really spoiled like that, and lets just say we are not friends anymore. she totally changed.|`|HkpMrMepaa	RIDICULOUS!!!<br>  <br>  I'm not 16 yet but i think they should get an older car first b/c they will probably total it!!|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Well I get a mustang on my 16 bday IF I stay on the honor roll till then. so do you think I'm spoiled?|`|eISzHe5maa	I think nothing of it. If their parents can afford it and their teenagers are pretty responsible and mature then sure. After all who am I to judge? I'm not getting my license until the summer and my mom talked about getting me a car or get a new car for herself and give me her old one, which is fine but I'm kind of scared to drive it because that thing needs new brakes. She doesn't really want to share cars and she's waiting for the day I get my license because that's when I'm driving completely for myself. No longer will she drive me anywhere she said unless we're going out together. We're very fortunate to be able to afford it. <br>  <br>  I'll get a job and I'll pay for gas and stuff like that but to my mom school always comes first until I'm out of school and I officially start working. So I'm not exactly sure how it'll work out.<br>  <br>  As long as the child doesn't take their parents for granted and just asks like everything's supposed to be given to them and again, the parents can afford it I really don't see the problem. It doesn't automatically make them "spoiled" just someone who's very fortunate.|`|9LTWa08Laa	i mean i can see why people will assume that they're spoiled & ungrateful brats<br>  but not ALL of them are.<br>  my sister got a BMW when she graduated from highschool, but she actually works really hard and is very independent, she pays for any damages on her car with her own money<br>  and my best friend got her dad's old mercedes, but in general she's actually not spoiled at all.<br>  <br>  but who cares if they have nice cars? It doesnt really matter to me, i dont really pay attention to those things. more important stuff in life.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't think anything of it. <br>  Their parents have money and buy them a nice car, so what?<br>  <br>  Just because someone is 16 doesn't mean they should get a junker that is unsafe. <br>  <br>  If the family has the money and they decide to buy their kid a car on their 16th birthday then that is fine. Its no big deal.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	First of all, 16 year old should not be on the road, they are mosty horrible dangerous drivers. <br>  <br>  And as for the spoiled little pigs? They don't deserve what they get, they are pathetic and will never be decent human beings if they are spoiled like that.|`|Qr1jNy4Paa	My mom's getting me a brand new car when I turn 15. I can't really judge. I do think they should work for it but if your mom insists... >.>|`|de3585a639a519d1686e00acd0c94d58aa	I think they are spoiled brats!I think the kids shouldve worked for car.|`|p3d3E75oaa	spoiled brats|`|D0vWyHsDaa	They are spoiled brats. They think that they are so amazing because their parents spend lots of money buying them nice things. What happens if they get into a crash like many teen drivers? They just have their parents pay to fix it for them. They don't learn about responsibility if their parents give them whatever they want.|`|9y4AXY21aa	Well my first thought is "I wish those were my parents" my second is "Those little bastards should have to work for it". lol           Hey whats that it says mommy to twin girls?you are not even 16 yet?? tsk tsk
6DNHxcSsaa	With your first baby it is good that you've effaced but it will take awhile before you start dilating. At 35 weeks your baby would be considered a preemie and go to the NICU. Doctors can be off a pound either direction so I wouldn't worry about a "big" baby. My daughter was told the baby was a 10 pounder and weighed 6 pounds 6 ounces. <br>  Birth blessings to you.
2irmTjQ3aa	Eww. Troll.|`|ZyXTngiCaa	Oh what a moran! ROFLMAO|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You know, I usually get irritated with trolls, but for whatever stupid reason, this one made me laugh.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	you are not supposed to throw the test in the toilet you are supposed to pee on it you have to do it again why would someone tell you to throw it in the toilet i'm sorry|`|AA10285288	About 4 - 6 hours depending on the size of the pipes. <br>  <br>  Good luck and wear boots!!!!|`|EFlX4GYOaa	"stupid moran!" from above.<br>  <br>  best EVER|`|OGCohFyNaa	That really sounds like a strange suggestion. I would just buy a new one, as your results could be extremely faulty coming out of a sewer line. <br>  Just follow the directions that come on the test - don't throw it in the toilet. That can seriously clog your drains and isn't going to do you any good in terms of finding out whether or not you're pregnant.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Not sure.<br>  But I would just go to the store and buy another one.<br>  And this time don't flush or throw it away until you read it lol.|`|34vGrrVwaa	Litlbits22 called you a moran.|`|oENe16luaa	Back off Beyotch. Doc is off limits.|`|rFxLHqQFaa	I'll get it for you...but I do charge for my "services".|`|35kVNi5oaa	you make no sense.|`|MRV9rNyjaa	wow! yeah go fishing in the sewer to go and get it! stupid moran!
3Fu1DkvZaa	You're defiantly not being hormonal. You are feeling betrayed by your own mother. <br>  There is nothing to be embarrassed about. <br>  The first thing by purchasing you new clothing. That there tells me that she is a controlling person. She is also stating that you do not have the brains to take care of yourself, let alone your child.<br>  Second, she is the one with the problem. Instead of embracing the fact of being a grandmother, she is rejecting your talents. <br>  What a shame.<br>  I do suspect in the future, you and your husband shall here about how you cannot care for the child, dress the child "properly" or anything else along that line.<br>  When I was married to my first husband, I could never get anything right in her eyes. <br>  She was such a pain and more. Finally, I told her that if she had such an issue with the way we dressed, cared for our kids etc.. then she needed to buy herself a mirror and look real hard. Because that would be the last time she would see her face if she did not back off.<br>  Needless to say, I did not have much problems afterward.<br>  hehehe.|`|35kVNi5oaa	I'm 23 weeks and two days, I'm about five four and my fiance is six four, and my tummy is big too! i mean there is something growing inside..and its going to need some space. I don't have many maternity pants either..which is fine! It's not like these pants have to last you the rest of your life. You shouldn't have to be covered in fabric. We live in America were women show off their bodies, and pregnancy is BEAUTIFUL don't hide it under a sea of fabric. :]|`|MSfC0FXvaa	omg. just go in your clothes. i know shes your mother but tell her that she can sit in the waiting room and not go in there with you since shes so embarrased. that is completley rude. i am also 29 weeks pregnant, by the way. :) i hope all is good at the appt. and good luck and congrats! :)|`|n3FfpRqCaa	It is sort of rude of your mother, but at the same time she is probably trying to help..being that she is your mother.  I would take the free clothes and run with it.  Give her a big smile & laugh. I wouldnt take it personally.|`|zMDpyx74aa	You are normal for feeling angry & hurt, I'm sure I would feel the same way.  I think you should just wear whatever you want to wear, your not 10 any more & your mother don't have a right to tell you what to wear.  When I was pregnant on my 1st baby I was about 165lbs at 9 months (my height is approx 5'3)  & this time I am WAYYY more but I'm not worried about it at all.  As long as my baby is healthy I don't care.. there is lots of time to get the weight off later when he comes.  :)  Good luck :)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Oh my gosh!!! That is pretty much the rudest thing I have ever heard, I can't believe your own mother would do something like that. I'm so sorry! Ugh, this is making me angry for you! I don't think you are being hormonal, that was just pretty rude. I'd probably tell her that if she's so embarrassed to be seen with you then maybe she just should not go, and look for a friend to take you or something.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	You are not being hormonal at all! Your mom is a b*tch. My mom wants me to cover up more also, but I love wearing shirts that hug my belly and I love showing off my pregnancy, so I don't listen. Why would you want your mother there with you anyway? Call her and tell her you rather go alone, if you really don't have anyone to take you then call a taxi. I would never put up with this from my mother.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I guess we could also blame pregnancy hormones on my answer as well (i'm 6 weeks + 5 days) but your mother sounds just as selfish as mine!!! There is nothing wrong with you, it is your mother that has the problem. Do not destress about your size or weight issue, you will have plenty of time to exercise ect after your baby enters the world safely. Your mother is a *****, and i know just what thats like. My mother has a complex problem with anyone who is overweight, she is obsessed at watching the biggest loser ect...She had a go at me one day about my 2nd daughters size (yes she is a little rounder in the tummy/legs than she should be) but she is really tall for her age which helps to balance her out and she is certainly not unhealthy, well i completely went off my head, i told my mother to get out and that she had no heart. My mother has a long history of mental illness and when she doesn't take her depression tablets.....look out. It's a shame you don't have a friend or another relative to take you for your appointment. Don't let her stress you out because thats the reaction she is looking for from you, she wants to upset you. So don't let her win, wear whatever you feel is appropriate and comfortable and try your hardest to ignore her. I hope i have helped you in some way, and let you know that your not the only one in the world with a bitchy mother. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy..|`|MMF1YmZZaa	I would go with your mother. Accept the clothes if you like them, if not politely decline. <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Wear the tightest clothes and be all over the place! Lol, just kidding lets stay mature. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about your mother. She must be very uptight. Pregnancy is, for one thing, beautiful. I love how pregnant woman look. It is also one of the only times woman are "allowed" to gain weight (but not too much or the woman you work with will all be talking about how you just blew up). It is a very sick society we live in, and unfortunately so many people buy into it. <br>  <br>  Keep your head up! I'm sure you look adorable! Don't worry what your mother says and stay happy! Its good for the baby!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iKPSOMiSaa	oh lord, your mom sounds very shallow and insensitive. maybe you could drop your husband off at work and he could get someone to bring him home after work to keep you from going out late to get him. there has got to be someone else that could maybe give you a ride if ya'll cant work that out. being pregnant is hard enough without being around someone like her.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Wow, that's very rude of your mother! I wish my mother would say something like that to me, with all my raging pregnancy hormones i'd go off! Being pregnant is a beautiful thing, and you should flaunt it if you've got it! Screw what your mom says, you wear whatever YOU want to YOUR ultrasound, if your mom doesn't like it tell her to wait in the car!
yCwPxulYaa	Getting the baby out was all the relief I had!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	A lot of women do. It gets cleaned up so fast though that no one really notices. You lose all your dignity when giving birth. =)|`|01vMpHkWaa	lmfao i did<br>  i was surprised but the nurse said ITS GOOD! because it means im pushing correctly|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Sometimes women end up pooping on the table from all the pushing but it doesn't happen everytime|`|GqsLNUE8aa	It's a lot of pushing and a lot of pressure down there. It's no big deal for in those moments women lose all vanity.|`|yo0qnedIaa	sometimes.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Yep, in some cases they do. Normally if it happens the nurses wipe it up and go on about their business. No one really says anything or makes a big deal out of it,and most women don't know unless they ask. I'm sure once you're pushing that hard and in that much pain trying to get your baby into the world safely, all modestly goes out the window.<br>  <br>  I, however, had a planned cesarean due to a baby that was stubborn and refusing to turn...so I never did that. BUT when they pulled her out of my uterus, she peed in my open incision. And all over the nurses. LOL. She's my little squirt. : )|`|TJusfEnlaa	some do, yes. i thankully didn't! my mum said when she had me 24 years ago they gave you an enema. Whoever thought it was a good idea to dehydrate you before your body undertakes a huge stress like labour is an idiot!! so yeah they do not do that anymore, but apparently it is no big deal if you do - the nurse cleans it up quickly and you might not even know you have done it.|`|VHs7OPGlaa	Some women do and some women don't. Personally I did but who cares when your focused on pushing out that baby or babies in my case. You have to push out a baby like your trying to poop so if you eaten anything that day then you probably would pee or poop|`|oo7p1Etyaa	It CAN happen, just depends. It didn't happen to me, I ended up going before I went into labor. I went a few times, I thought I was getting sick so I went to the hospital, was there for 3 hours & nothin. I went home and 2 hours later my water broke. lol ironic|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Ya it happens. I did and at the time really you have zero shame and I could have cared less. You have to push like you are having a bowel movement and if you hadn't emptied your bowels before hand you will probably poo a little.|`|XFL6SWHkaa	doctors say its normal ive had 3 and haven't ever.but with whats happining its the least of ur worries.and the nurses wipe it really fast its not like they just leave it there to wonder what the hell u were eating to make it look like that.much love|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Sometimes it does happen.  When it does, the hospital staff puts a clean sterile sheet under the mom, and she keeps going as if nothing happened.|`|AA11134717	it ha-pens sometimes but you wont even know it.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Babies do flip around, even right up until birth. ∠°)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call and ask your doctor but if he hasn't noticed anything strange your baby is most likely ok.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I think you're being pretty paranoid... If they told you everything is perfect, then you should take their word. They know what you're doing. &Yeah, babies switch positions pretty often. <br>  Just relax!|`|StJGeiFyaa	i think you're paranoid. i also know that stressing yourself out is stressing your baby out. calm down. if his/her legs have something wrong with them, there's nothing you can do until s/he's born. so just take a chill pill. i'm sure your baby is the picture of health and you will laugh at yourself when s/he is born. good luck and congrats :)|`|ibWLdXlJaa	He can turn. I know mine did! Was he active during the u/s or was he just kind of kicked back? They said he is fine so I wouldn't worry too much right now but if you are talk to your doctor. Maybe they can give you another u/s to check on him.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	lol,, ur so cute,, ur babies fine, ur just stressin, relax<br>  your scan was otherwise normal, and baby is still small to see those kicks from the outside, not all can kick so hard, give it another month<br>  with my 1st born i never even felt movement till week 23, and after that she was so mild, i never saw kicks or pushing from the outside, she was very gentle,, till she came out, lol<br>  <br>  ive got 4 kids and each pregnancy id worry too, i always thought something was wrong, one of mine kicked too much, so i complained that i thought he was in distress, lol<br>  one scan i couldnt see one hand so till he was born i imagined one stump for an arm, i swear<br>  one hiccuped almost constant and reallllly fast, like a heartbeat almost, the midwife laughed and said, ''thats the fastest ive ever hear a fetus hiccup'',,,, so i always used a stop watch to time the hiccups as i worried something was wrong with bubs digestion, id even time my freinds  tummys hiccups and i freaked cos my babies were faster<br>  <br>  i swear i worrrrrrried as much as possible and in the end i have 4 healthy children,, sometimes we need to chill out and enjoy our pregnancies, i really wish that i did, i spent every moment worrying that id go into preterm labour or have a baby with some major deformity, but i was truly blessed, may god bless you too, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|avFchCblaa	Hi i have twin boys that are about 2 months now and i felt the same way neither of the boys kicked.<br>  i was terrified because all my friends said that was the worst part.<br>  don't worry it is completey normal.<br>  <br>  it's going to be fine but your dr. or whatever shouldn't make you<br>  feel nervous or paranoid.<br>  you should say something next time.((:<br>  good luck.|`|AA10529334	Oh goodness this doctor really got you worked up didnt he? No I am sure all is fine with baby. Some babies kick more than others. Some babies are more likely to move their arms around. Some practically bruise their mothers and others are more gentle. Thats just the way it is.  Baby does move around quite a bit at this stage - still very tiny and has plenty of room to move still.|`|jJjoZ3zfaa	from what I hear babies do tend move around like, not just kicking and punching, but actually turning. But thats only what Ive heard.|`|hNlsD5gaaa	it could be the babies arms rather than the legs. but if ur nervous it can affect the baby, u should go back if u hve any doubts
0kWkX8yiaa	you are probably just feel nauseous because you are thinking about it to much...brown spotting before your period is completely normal..wait until (if) you have a missed period to take a test|`|WOnDm7a5aa	No you are not preggo|`|ojHVod5uaa	You definately need to wait a few days and take another test,alot of the symptoms you are describing are signs of pregnancy,but they could also be pms or even triggered by worry.|`|35kVNi5oaa	wait a few more days and do another one in the morning, sounds to me like you are pregnant.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Recheck preg test in 2-3 weeks.<br>  Go to your doctor.  Sounds like you have trichomonas.
kaqPSgTVaa	I would stop now and just use condoms until you are ready. It can take a while to start ovulating again. Some people ovulate again right away but it can take others a few months to start up again.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Some people get pregnant right after going off of birth control and for some it takes a couple of months for them to get their body back in the routine of things. Personally, it took me 6 months to conceive baby #2 after going off of birth control.|`|jcXSNjowaa	theres many woman that fall pregnant when actually taking the pill religously..if your serious about not to get pregnant for 6 months. take the pills for 5 months.|`|ejPPUm4maa	I think it's 3 months before you want to get pregnant but ask your Dr and best of luck! :)|`|0kWkX8yiaa	probably in like 4 or 5 months
gW3k9Eyhaa	because your baby is so young it would be best to take him to the doctor, he hasn't got a immune system built up yet. Better to be safe :)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's not unheard of for a baby to teeth that young, it's just rare. It sounds like he may have a slight cold or something??? Have you checked into that? Signs of teething are gnawing on things, drooling, lots of runny poopy diapers, irritability, and you can normally feel a slight bump under their gums. <br>  <br>  As for the "pablum" in the bottle. That's a negative. Your baby just needs more formula. You shouldn't give solids before 4 months at the earliest, and when you do it should never be in a bottle. That's a choking hazard. This is just an old wive's tale that it helps baby sleep or keeps them full longer. It's something that was done by our parent's and grandparents and since then has been proven wrong, ineffective, and even dangerous by many studies. I would just continue formula feeding and bump up the ounces if baby is still hungry. And of course you can bring it up to your baby's doc, but as long as baby is gaining weight, I'm sure all is well. Just keep formula feeding and hold off til at least the 4 month mark.|`|iQcd37Goaa	I READ THAT IR CAN HAPPEN BUT IT SAID THAT IF HAPPEN BEFORE 2 MONTH YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR...
AA11091998	You're thirteen and cursing at your mother? Shame. <br>  It is beyond fair. It was lenient.|`|eQLewCSzaa	Well first, that is very rude and immature to say that to your mom, and if you act immature, you get treated like your immature, with a big fat spanking. <br>  <br>  well... in all actuality, I don't believe spanking should extend this far in to childhood, soo... you should definitely be grounded.|`|Wa0pHJwMaa	When you say spanking, what do you mean? Was it a beat down where your mom left marks, or were you spanked hard a couple of times? Marks are unacceptable, but spankings aren't. Assuming your mom wasn't beating you, I would say that your remark was disrespectful and you should have been punished.|`|17myjpS3aa	You're kind of old for a spanking, but since this is the ultimate<br>  disrespect to your mom, it's more than fair.<br>  <br>  If I said that to my mom at that age, I wouldn't of been able to<br>  sit down for a week.|`|Vlrris3jaa	same thing happened to me. just say your sorry and tell her that you think your too old to be spanked, and suggest a different punishment next time it happens. it kinda worked for me.|`|TsQumtCLaa	if you f bombed me not only would you get a spanking, but you would be in your room for a week  with no computer and no phone|`|ec05c67a0aa214a128170583a71301ccaa	U should thank her for not killing u. that was bad of u.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	If you were my child you would have gotten a smack across the face.<br>  No matter what she did you make you mad doesn't give you the right to cuss at your mother. She gave birth to you and you owe her respect.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I don't believe in spanking kids.<br>  You DEFIANTLY deserve punishment for such disrespect.What were you thinking? Respect your mom.She can be gone tomorrow and you would never know what you miss until she is gone.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	My son is 13 yrs old and a month ago he called me a B*tch for not buying him a new playstation game and I was trying to explain to him that the bills and rent come first, well, he didn't like that so he called me the B word and when he got home, he got the back of my hand across his month and 13 sheets of paper and a dozen of pencil and he was to write "I will never call my Mom a B*tch and I will show her respect and that life is not always about getting what I want, I should be glad I have a house over my head, food in my tummy and clothes on my back" both sides of the paper too. He has not said a bad word since because he told me, his fingers felt like they fell off. I told him as long as he is living in my house, the writing will get worse as he gets older. He apologize over and over again. if you were my child, i would do the same thing. Children get away with to much these days and I think that's why some kids are so messed up. I'm kind of strict as I don't want my kids to end up on the wrong tracks someday in the future. You should be happy to have a Mom, some kids would die for a Mom or Dad. Go apologize to her NOW!!!!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, she should have back handed you and took away your phone, and grounded you for a month at least.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That's what you get for being so disrespectful and rude to your mother.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Yes, it is,<br>  A tip of my hat to your mom.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	What most of these answerers seem to be forgetting is that your Mum probably made her fair share of rude comments too. If she's going to hit you then that shows she is just as immature and acted worse than you. So if she acted like a child she should also get treated like one that's what you're all saying, right?<br>  <br>  Swearing is bad, but it's ok to kick the sh*t out of some one is ok? <br>  <br>  I suppose the police should mace you and throw in you jail next time you slag off the government, how could you be so disrespectful to the people that provide you with houses, food, water and safety?|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	I don't give a damn how old my kids are.  If they ever have the adacity to tell me to shout the f-ck they are going to get it.  Respect your mom and act like a young adult.  Then you won't get spanked like a 2 yr old.  Sick and tired of spoiled brat kids thinking they are in damn charge.  You are not!|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	i would have slapped the sh it out of your little snobby ***. what the hell are you thinking talking to your mom like that. shes your mother not your ex boyfriend|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Then don't disrespect your mom!!|`|vZToCRVuaa	u swear at 13? and u tell you mom to **** off? what kind of a person r u? u totally deserve to get bashed up|`|frpCK0utaa	Deal with it. you acted like a spoiled little brat. be glad you arent grounded on top of it. unless you are. ha!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Oh...did you feel you deserved more respect than that since you are a teenager?|`|15qceXaOaa	u deserve a good spanking! if u were my kid u would be on ur way 2 miltary school! be thankful 4 nice parents!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	the squeeze box and bicycle worked for me. another one that they don't have on there is to put the baby across your lap face down with his tummy on one of your knees and legs hanging beside it and bounce your knee softly.  mine loved it and it was usually a gas release.  if he wasn't gassy or if those didn't work he liked to be carried around to look at the floor with an arm and leg on each side of my arm against my body.  like you were cradling him but upside down.<br>  <br>  also,you said more than an hour, he could be hitting a spurt and want more food again.<br>  <br>  i also had to cut dairy out at about that age for my son, he was gassy constantly and always screaming and spitting up and screaming all over again.  He'sfine with me eating dairy now.  I started dairy again at around 3 months and he got only a little more gassy, but by that time he had figured out how to push it out.<br>  <br>  lol, i keep remembering things, he did alot better if i put him to bed slightly on his side.  not so much that he could roll onto his belly but enough to be on his left side.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Swaddle him up, turn the lights off, and rock with him. Maybe try singing softly in his ear. If this continues, though, I'd phone a nurse/pediatric hotline or your son's doctor and tell them what's going on.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Car ride?<br>  <br>  My rule of thumb is if the baby is inconsolable for over an hour it's time to head to the doctor. He could have an ear infection. Very painful!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	A warm bath, massage, feed, swaddle, rock has always worked a treat for my daughter. BUT you may find that now he is feeding off yours and your wifes anxiety, you must be feeling frustrated by now? And he will sense this, is there anyone that you could get to come over and just take him into the next room so you and your wife can gather yourselves?? Even for 10 mins? <br>  <br>  Have you also tried taking his nappy off and letting him have a nudy kick around?? I would make a drs appointment and while you are waiting for the appointment try all of these things......good luck and alothough it feels overwhelming and frustrating now this is just a tiny part of your babies whole life and you wont even remember it in 10 years!!!! xxx|`|VHs7OPGlaa	did you try to burp him? My first son was very fussy and we took him for a car ride a few times. I am not sure how much he is eating and if it is bottle or breast but my first son (breast fed) also had eaten and 1 hr. later was screaming and i tried to calm him for 1 hour and fed him again and he went right to sleep.|`|oo7p1Etyaa	He might have colic, he will eventually cry himself to sleep. But make an appointment with his ped and ask what the doc thinks. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OYy82bAYaa	he might be teething try bonjela? Give him huggles babies love hugs or even a soothing bath I know that works for my son. You can only try.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Maybe a car ride ?<br>  <br>  I would definately try feeding again, there's a major growth spurt around two months.<br>  <br>  If its colic, lying him down skin on skin with his belly against yours might help. <br>  <br>  Also, babies can react to your stress from their crying and then it just escalates. My girl loves baths, so when she gets too worked up and nothing works, I get in the bath with her. Sort of changes her mind I think...<br>  <br>  sounds silly, but when she gets into ''crying mode'' its like she's in a bubble and nothing else works. Then gently blowing in her face gets her attention, this is a new sensation so she opens her eyes to check it out and snaps out of it !<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|knWxRkDTaa	Put him in his car-seat or something and stick him on the dryer while its on, my son loves it when hes fussy, another good idea is swaddling hold him in ur arms, stomach to stomach hold him tight in a quiet room, with maybe candles lit (for a calm mood) and rock back and forth and whisper shhhhh to him....My son calms down when I do that with him as well.|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	He could already be teething try rubbing his gums with a cool wet cloth and see if he sucks on it for relief. Otherwise you could walk him around the house or take him for a small drive around the block a few times, it might help calm him down. Good luck :)|`|CzDyZZBEaa	At next feeding put alittle cereal in his milk he may not be satisfied with his milk and still hungry had the same problem with my son and he is 7 weeks!  Or a car ride my son goes right to sleep when we ride in the car!|`|iQcd37Goaa	try putting him on his stomach and pad her back and rub it that might help with gas..

You are in your 8th week or the end of your 2nd month.<br>  However, Depo Provera may have altered your cycle somewhat.

sOO93u5Oaa	If he had already ejaculated prior to this and did not urinate after, you could become pregnant, because sperm could still be left in his urethra and come out in his pre-ejaculation. If that isn't the case, then the chances are basically zero.|`|ejPPUm4maa	Their is a chance but if he didn't C-M most likely not.  You do however have to be careful of the Pre C-M! Good Luck To You!

chmuDZObaa	If the doctor is worried about it he will have an ultrasound when you get to the hospital in labor.  They'll feel your belly and determine then since it will be most relevant at that point.   My OB said babies rarely turn back around once they go "head down" but it's possible.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	A good doctor can accurately feel the baby's position without an ultrasound.

1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	No you are not pregnant.  Your breasts are sore and you are tired because your period is just around the corner.  You probably aren't even late.  Your period should be counted in days not just saying "the 28th of every month."  Common misperception.|`|1pBKmytbaa	There is no chance absolutely,Due to some other reasons like forecoming period may be the reasons for your symptoms ,wait 4days more ,if there is no period consult your doctor|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Sperm can't swim through clothing, so no.|`|c3LF3mL2aa	It is possible... Go to your doctor.|`|35kVNi5oaa	It's unlikely. But those are some symptoms i had.|`|oM3vGG2Waa	I doubt it. Breasts get tender before youre going to get your period which is why doctors say it is the best time to do a breast cancer check by yourself. being tired can also mean that youre going to get your period soon.<br>  <br>  you can only get pregnant if the sperm gets on your actual vag area.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	Very doubtful if you honestly had your underwear on. Those symptoms can also just be part of your period (which could just be coming at a different time then you expected, they're not always at the same time every month.) But you should get a pregnancy test just in case, from local drugstores, walmart, planned parenthood, or even from a wellness center at your school.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4TqUgtpzaa	I highly HIGHLY doubt it. Sperm cannot live outside the body, so even if there was pre-*** on your underwear, the sperm could not venture through the fabric and into your body. I think you are thinking about it a little too much.|`|ONe2T42Vaa	If he never penetrated you and no sperm went in you then that's not possible.<br>  That's like saying, "I gave him head and swallowed it, can it travel down and get my pregnant?"<br>  Lol, no sweetie, you're not.|`|749a472d80ff6b3462df8579bf6f6d67aa	It's doubt full- VERY doubt ful, but to make certain, see the doctor or wait a week or so and take a test.

Take a pregnancy test.
F12ekJ7Saa	Whenever you have sex there is a possiblity that you can get pregnant. It doesn't matter if he did or did not c[u]m! Its a fact that pre-c[u]m cannot be controlled from the male and it also is proven that pre-c[u]m has sperm. Women have gotten pregnant from this before. My advice for you is to go and get the morning after pill (called Plan B)<br>  <br>  Next time, don't give into sex and use protection! Good Luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can still get pregnant if he didn't ejaculate. Sorry.|`|8RfmosODaa	I dont see how no *** would come out. There is still pre ***. You shouldn't have sex cuz of pressure!|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	First of all, women don't produce semen. duh. <br>  <br>  Secondly, whether you saw/felt semen or not, he could have easily released pre-ejaculate that you didn't see or feel that contains sperm and can cause pregnancy. Chances are moderate to high.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Depends on whether you were close to ovulation. Pre-ejaculate contains sperm and it only takes one sperm to become pregnant. Every guy has pre-ejaculate, so some semen did get inside of you. Take a test if you miss your period.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Your chances are high because even if he did not ejaculate there was probably some pre-*** that got inside you.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	sorry honey but it only takes one of your mans little guys to find their mark..|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Okay first of all, having sex under peer pressure? What is that about? Anyway secondly, only men have sperm, women do not, so you both would not have semen come out. But guess what, whenever you do not have protected sex, this is a possibility you could be pregnant. And judging from your question, you are very young and not ready to even be having sex. So just stay away from the boys from now on.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Umm only one of you should have "semen come out..."<br>  <br>  We can't give you a precise measurement. Pre-ejaculate can get you pregnant but its probably unlikely. Don't be a stupid girl who doesn't use a condom because she is pressured. You have control of your body take responsibility for it hun|`|4TqUgtpzaa	Overall, having sex without protection leaves you with a risk of pregnancy. I hate to sound cruel, but it is pretty dumb of you to have unprotected sex, let alone under peer pressure..<br>  <br>  And what do you mean by "neither of us had semen come out?"...|`|mYpsfptTaa	im sorry hunny but if there was NO protection no matter what..no birth control or no condem then the odd are against you. im so sorry and i hope it wasnt sommething crazy or you got hurt in the matter or anything. im not saying you're def prego.. just be more conciense of what goes on within your body the next couple weeks and hope for the best. if you wind up "lucky" and not prego than make sure you're very careful next time and use protection!|`|oGbHyZR8aa	Pretty high. There's pre-ejaculation. So even if he didn't ejaculate while having an orgasm, he could have a little without realizing it. If it was in the past 24-48hours, try getting Plan B.|`|35kVNi5oaa	neither of us has semen come out?<br>  <br>  and if this would ruin your life you shouldn't let peer pressure get to you.
1Uf0vbhkaa	By this time the doctors can tell if it is a boy or girl.  I found out at 20 weeks, but sometimes people do not want to find out, so that could be why she doens't know yet.  I found out I was pregnant on October 15 and my last period was September 11.  So that means I conceived somewhere between the 25-27 of September.  I am due June 18.  The best thing to do is get a paternity test taken.  If your boyfriend is telling you the truth it can't be his baby, but I would get a test done just to be sure.  Good luck with everything.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The ONLY way to know for sure is to have a DNA test done when the baby comes out. Doctors can be off by a few weeks, yes and I'm sorry but your boyfriend CAN be lying to you. It happens.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	the date of conception IS 2 weeks off. You are relly only pg 38 wks but count from last period as a guess type thing.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	well ur boyfriend will have to go get a dna test done to know for sure ... he cant just say its not his. he could be liein|`|iKPSOMiSaa	no, it wouldnt be 2 weeks off. shes probably lying.|`|AA10458750	Use your head......what is he going to say? He lied and was sleeping with this girl while talking to you? Unless your bf has some enormous amount of $$$, I don't see why she would say anythign about the pregnnacy to him if it wasn't his. And, who said she slept w/ somebody else? Did you hear her say that or did he say that? SOMEBODY is lying!!! You'll know soon enough when the DNA test gets done.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	1 - Her LMP would be Sep 17th to have conception on Oct 1.  Due date would be June 24th.<br>  OR<br>  2 - Her LMP Oct 1st, conception on Oct 15th, due date July 8th<br>  <br>  A 21 week ultrasound is not accurate for dating a pregnancy.  It must be done before 12 weeks to be completely accurate.  However, it would seem she conceived in October.  Seems like they both have a reason to lie.  Cut your losses now and run.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	Just for date comparison:<br>  <br>  My last period was 10-5<br>  I figure I ovulated around 10-18/19<br>  My due date is 7/12 (only 4 days after her)<br>  <br>  Someone is lying.|`|IPFCtyvQaa	Sorry the only way to tell is a DNA test.

Wind can be measured so you can show them that way. Thunder can be scientifically explained so you can get them a book.

That God represents the good side of all things, and Satan represents all the bad (evil) side of things.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You can not see air, but you can see and feel it's affects and hear it some times.<br>  You do not see emotions i.e. love, or hate, or anger,only the affects of it.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	You know they are real Because you feel them.

2irmTjQ3aa	Yes it is very wrong! You can't even drive yet or get a real job and you want a baby. If you have one your parents or the government will have to raise it. You are a ridiculous little girl.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, don't do it. And people that tell you you are too young and such are not being rude, they are being honest. How good of a job could you or your boyfriend have at 14 or 16? My husband and I are both college graduates and will still be making sacrifices to provide a nice life for our child. You should wait until a time in your life where you will not need your mother to help you. At your age you have a lot of things left to do before you even think about having a baby! You may really want a baby now but you will still want that baby later on when you are prepared to take care of him/her. Just wait.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Well, I understand why you would want a baby, but you're just too young right now, even to be having sex. You should wait til college, you never know what the future brings. I hope you make the smart and right decision.

Babies can't be having babies!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If you want to have a baby and have your mom help out I would talk to her about it first and see what she thinks.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i really hope this is a joke. im 30 and when i had my first baby at 28 i just realized how very demanding it is to take care of a baby.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	you are 14 years old! you're a LITTLE GIRL. <br>  <br>  i don't know how any 14 year olds having a job unless they're babysitting and making $5 an hour and i wouldn't hire a 14 year old to babysit my child unless they were unbelievably mature for their age. which i'm doubting you are because you're dying to have a baby so young.<br>  <br>  and no you don't know how hard it is to take care of a baby! i am 18 years old and 18 weeks pregnant with my baby and when i babysit my friends kids sometimes i am so worn out all i want to do is drop to the floor and i'm always learning something new with a baby and going through some sort of challenge.<br>  <br>  you're too young...don't be selfish.<br>  <br>  graduate highschool first.|`|7xit1ogxaa	You are not ready for the responsibility of raising a child. While baby-sitting is a great way to make money while you are in high school, it is in no means enough to support a baby. I have a hard time believing that your boyfriend has a good paying job since he is only 16. Finish high school, go to college, get married, and then think about having children. Also, baby-sitting is not the same as having a child, you can't just give back a baby when you are tired of it.|`|b4e9fa4dc7294d8b1a86d0fcb130e389aa	Of course you shouldn't do it. You are still a child yourself. And no one knows what it takes to raise a child until after they've had to. Babysitting is far different from having your own. Wait until you are done with school, until you have your own apartment, a well established occupation, and wait until you are sure you guys are going to be together for the long haul. I was fourteen once and I also thought that my boyfriend and I would be together forever...guess what? We're not together anymore. i'm glad I chose not to get pregnant. I want my children to have both of their parents together.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Yes, it's wrong. You are not going to be able to support a baby on one minimum wage job and babysitting money, and you are not physically or emotionally ready for a baby. Don't throw your lives away.|`|qfPnl61baa	Wow, 14 is so young.  You have your whole life ahead of you to have babies.  I would wait till your body is ready and mature enough to carry a baby...you would not want to jeopardize your baby!!  Really give it some thought.  : )|`|WZQKevt8aa	No, I don't think you should sweetie. What about in a few years when you want to go to parties and you can't because your child is sick? I think you should wait.|`|113FoyMFaa	"i know how hard it is to take care of a baby"<br>  <br>  nope.  you don't.  babysitting is nowhere near the experience you need.|`|35kVNi5oaa	I think you should talk to your mother about this, since she would be a big role in your pregnancy.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Sweetie you are way too young to take of a child at this stage in your life. I got pregnant with my son when I was 15 and had him at 16 and it was super super hard. Babies are not just something cute to look at and love you. They are a lot of hard work. And cost a lot of money. I'm not even sure how i've made it through the past 3 and a half years. Wait until you're grown up. You've got your whole life ahead of you to have a child. If you're asking Yahoo Answers if you should have a baby at 14, chances are you should not.|`|oM3vGG2Waa	besides what everyone has said, getting pregnant so early isnt good for both mother and child. Your body isnt ready for it yet which can cause birth defects to your baby or harm to you.<br>  <br>  Dont me so impatient. Savor having time just for yourself. College? Great future job? Travel the world? have you considered these?|`|TzhA4cMcaa	im sorry but isn't 14 a bit too young to have a child? maybe you should wait until you are at least 16|`|Z08iVuGJaa	I thought the same thing when I was 14 and my partner was 17. We had a baby because I too thought he had a good job and that I would go back to school after. However, a baby costs so much and at the age of 14, with no disrespect, your idea of your partners wage being "well paying" proberly doesn't even begin to cover the costs of a baby. Ever week they need nappies, wipes, food, clothes...<br>  <br>  Being a mother is amazing and I love my little angel, but I can't help feeling that I missed out on my childhood and education. Life has been hard and money has been tight. I wish i had listened to my mum and waited another 3 or 4 years. <br>  <br>  I've changed so much in the last 6 years, and have had to grow up. You love your boyfriend now but a baby will change everything between you both, not always for the better.<br>  <br>  The best person to talk to is your mum... she loves you and cares for you. She has also been there. Hope this helps. :-)

6lm66aHtaa	My husband (who is not circumcised)  says its all pretty much the same. He cleans that area well, and would either way. He always has. Nothing has ever been different for him. I dont see how potty training would be different either.|`|FbWpO6Wxaa	I have never in my life seen as much confusing information on a topic as this one. My son is five years old and I had read that by that age, the foreskin should be able to be pulled back - his wasn't. I took him to my doctor who had him referred to a urologist. Well the urologist came back and said he wouldn't see him because it's quite normal at that age to not have foreskin coming back yet and not to be concerned until he was a teenager!! I've had friends who have strongly disagreed with the urologist and suggested I get a second opinion. On the internet, I've read that it's fine to leave it until they're teens, and I've alread that by age four or five it should be coming back. I honestly have no idea what to do right now. He seems fine for now and I always tell him to try and pull it back when he's in the tub to make him aware of it. I'm honestly beginning to think it might be a matter of it being a different situation for every boy.<br>  <br>  Potty training wasn't an issue - it didn't seem to make any difference about his aim. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps (sort of!!)|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	I went through the same thing with my first son.  After talking to heaps of doctors for opinions, I found that it isn't going to be worth to get my sons circumcised.  Your gp will answer any cleaning questions you may need to answer.  The thing to bear in mind, and it sounds kinda gross, but as babies learn about their body parts, that new part becomes a new "toy" so to speak, same happens with this part of the body.  you will find that in playing they tend to pull at it, giving you some indication.  I don't remember what age the doctor told me to start cleaning it but I know that you simply put slight pressure at the base in order to gently pull the skin back as far as it will go, and if you do this in the bath, it sorta becomes self cleaning.  As I said, the doctors were my best source of information on this, and are able to answer any questions you may have.  I found that my gp was more understanding, and showed my pictures in books, because he said that most males used to be cut, so he finds a lot of people not knowing what to do.|`|UyJ03tlFaa	no need,my little brother had his done as a babe and the doctor did an awful job!!!,we didnt pay the bill cause it messed up the way he pees now .just make sure its clean and he'll be just healthy:)good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/easy.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/easy.h...</a><br>  During infancy and early childhood, only the outside of the intact penis needs to be rinsed with warm water. The foreskin should not be retracted during cleaning. It's that simple.<br>  <br>  There is much unnecessary anxiety over the issue of hygiene. It is not at all difficult to maintain proper hygiene. “...health professionals generally agree that uncircumcised boys do not have any special hygienic problems.” Concern for proper hygiene is over emphasized, and so the needless practice of routine circumcision continues.<br>  <br>  Overzealous cleaning attempts can cause posthitis, urinary tract infections and phimosis. People are surprised to learn that the intact penis requires no special care. The best advice is to simply leave it alone.<br>  Consider providing your doctor with an Intact Care Agreement.<br>  <br>  Usually starting around the age of 5 or 6, boys should be taught to retract their own foreskins once a week and rinsing with warm water. Sometimes the separation process takes longer and a boy may not be able to fully retract his foreskin until he is 10 or more. This is normal and not cause for alarm. Once the foreskin is retractable , the instructions for cleaning are simple.<br>  <br>  1.) Gently pull the foreskin back.<br>  <br>  2.) Rinse with warm water only. Soap under the foreskin can cause irritation and swelling.<br>  <br>  3.) Pull the foreskin back in place over the head of your penis.<br>  <br>  No one should do this for him. He can pull the foreskin back by himself gently. After rinsing, he simply pulls the foreskin back into place. (Cleaning inspections are not required.) We do not pull out our teeth to prevent cavities -- we brush them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h...</a><br>  Does my son's foreskin need special cleaning?<br>  <br>  The uncircumcised penis is easy to keep clean. When your son is an infant, bathe or sponge him frequently and wash all body parts, including the genitals. You do not need to do any special cleansing, such as with cotton swabs or antiseptics. Simply wash the head of the penis and the inside fold of the foreskin with [mild!] soap and warm water. [Or rather, just wash the outside of the penis as a whole. The inner fold of the foreskin will look after itself.] Remember, do not try to forcibly retract the foreskin. You should watch your baby urinate to be sure that the hole in the foreskin is large enough to allow a normal stream. [You probably won't have much choice!] Consult your pediatrician if:<br>  <br>  * the stream of urine is never heavier than a trickle<br>  * your baby seems to have some discomfort while urinating.<br>  <br>  If the foreskin becomes inflamed, a common cause is the fungus monilia, which can cause redness and itching. This can be easily treated with an antifungal cream. If the foreskin becomes considerably red or swollen, see your pediatrician. If your son's foreskin is fully retracted before puberty, an occasional retraction with cleansing beneath will do. [He can do it himself.] Once your son starts puberty, he should retract the foreskin and clean beneath it on a daily basis. It should become a part of your son's total body hygiene, just like shampooing his hair and brushing his teeth. Teach your son to clean his foreskin by:<br>  <br>  * gently pulling it back away from the glans<br>  * rinsing the glans and inside fold of the foreskin with [mild] soap and warm water<br>  * [rinsing with water only]<br>  * pulling the foreskin back over the head of the penis.<br>  <br>  Caring for your son's uncircumcised penis requires no special action. Remember, foreskin retraction will occur naturally and should never be forced. Once boys begin to bathe themselves, they will need to wash their penis just as they do any other body part. [This excellent paragraph might have substituted for all the other worrisome advice before it.]<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd...</a><br>  The self-cleaning functions of the intact penis are analogous to the self-cleaning properties of the eyelid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi...</a><br>  The intact penis is a self-cleaning organ that produces smegma (a creamy substance also produced by females, containing dead cells and immunological substances) to combat infection<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o..." rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o...</a><br>  The mucosal genitalia, like the mucosal eyes and mouth, are self-cleaning and self-defending, and it could not possibly be otherwise. Moreover, mid-19th century British and American boys (and girls) did not suddenly develop filthy genitals which needed aggressive hygiene after their ancestors, for hundreds of generations, survived nicely on benign neglect.|`|lGcpXteaaa	woohoo! lol<br>  Ok, so its not much of a big deal nor very different than a circumsized boy. Just more natural! <br>  You dont ever pull the foreskin back just wash it with usual soap, there is really no need to 'take care' of anything! Its meant to be there, it does everything it supposed to do on its own. Obviously except washing with soap haha!<br>  So yeah, nothing will be different, there will be no sore penis just a totally natural healthy little boy! :)|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Well, my son is uncirc., and he's only 18 months old, but so far, we haven't had to do anything special to care for it.  Just wash the outside of the penis the same way you'd wash any other body part.<br>  <br>  The foreskin should retract on its own somewhere between 3-7 years, I think, but it can even happen later.  Until then, you never retract the foreskin -- the child will do it himself when he realizes that it can move.<br>  <br>  I don't know about having better aim (LOL!), but we're just now starting to potty train my son, and I don't think anything is different.  He's just sitting right now b/c he's not tall enough to stand at the potty, but we're not doing anything specific to him having a foreskin.|`|4arnbpUCaa	Just let it develop naturally. A European study found the average age that most boys' foreskins can fully retract isn't until 10 years old. In the meantime, just bathe him and wash it like any other exterior bodypart, a toe for example. No special attention required, and you shouldn't need any special potty training. Remember, millions of boys in Europe, Asia, South America (and now even in the US) aren't circumcised, so it shouldn't be an issue.|`|9rhqD6Hpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  No need to cut, just take care.<br>  <br>  1. Wash inside daily during shower.<br>  <br>  2. Use little bit baby oil (2-3drops) inside forskin so it can't be dry whole day.<br>  <br>  3. During the MASTBAT or SEX wash your forskin.<br>  <br>  4. Change your underwear on daily basis.<br>  <br>  5. Don't use any deo near the PE**IS as it will do side effect.<br>  <br>  6. After pee, clean ur foreskin with toilet paper/tissue paper.<br>  <br>  7. During the wet penis after watching any porn movies or oral, always clean it as it will casue bad odour.<br>  <br>  Eat more fruits to get protein.<br>  <br>  Watermelon, Pineapple & tomatoes is one of the best fruits for PE**IS health.<br>  <br>  Bye & Tc<br>  Mayank|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I read that you should "try" to pull the skin back around the 1st birthday.  My little one turned 1 a couple months ago, and I tried, but it didn't budge!<br>  I think for potty-training they need to pull it back to pee.....  LOL  I just realized I don't know!!  Like telling them to aim in the toilet isn't hard enough!<br>  My husband is uncut, so I figure I'll enlist his help with this one.

cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son had his done when he was 2 days old I believe. They took him and come back in like 15 Min's. Told me they numbed it and put a plasti bell on it and said to only clean it with mild soap and warm water. Like mix a little soap( like 2 or 3 drops) with water and gently squeeze the excess over his penis. I dont mean drown it or anything just enough to see its cleaning the urine and or BM off. They said to never use baby wipes on it bc the alcohol in them burns. That's how I cleaned it for a few weeks until his plasti bell fell off. They also gave me Tylenol infant drops to give every 4 hrs for the first 24 hrs. But I don't know if every hospital does this and I would ask first. My son after only being home a few days. Had 2 major blowouts while still healing from this and got poopies all over his front and back and I cleaned it that way. But make sure to be very easy and get all of the movement off so its not to get infected.<br>  <br>  Edit: this is just my personal experience with it and I was never given any creams to put on it after we got home. So just follow whatever they say to do for it. Btw by mild soap I mean like baby wash..Johnson's Head to Toe is what I used.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	They did my son on the day we checked out of the hospital. We just had to wait 8 hours to make sure there were no complications. It doesn't cause the baby any pain. They did the plastibell procedure on my son seen here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastibell" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastibell</a><br>  <br>  it causes no scarring, no open wounds, knives, cutting or anything, It requires no special cleansing or maintenance before, during, or after the procedure. It also causes no pain. My son was returned to me asleep. Please ask for this method if you get it done.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	You can get a numbing cream from the pharmacy for use just prior...follow the directions very well.<br>  <br>  After surgery, you use an anti-bacterial ointment like Polysporin (ointment, not the cream) and apply liberally at every diaper change.  Change the diaper frequently, and if some poop gets on there, you can rinse with lukewarm water to clear it away, then gently smear on the Polysporin before putting on a fresh diaper.  <br>  <br>  It heals in a week or so, on average.<br>  <br>  Whether you'd be in the room for the circ or not is dependent on the doctor you see...some prefer you to be there to comfort the baby, others prefer to do it with the parents outside the room.<br>  <br>  The doctor will give you very thorough instructions on care, and don't be afraid to call the office with questions if you have any concerns.|`|ydy6W0sXaa	I wasn't so keen on getting my son "cut," but my wife made the call anyway.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think there's any anesthesia involved with circumcision.  I think the logic is that babies cope with pain better than adults and anesthesia would do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Your kid is not circumcised in front of you in your room.  My son was circumcised in the nursery behind glass walls.  It's surgery.  It's going to be done in a "clean" environment if it's done in a hospital.<br>  <br>  After the circumcision is done, you'll notice bleeding on the gauze bandage on your kid.  Don't worry.  That's normal.<br>  <br>  You need to change the gauze bandage every time your son pees.  And the salt from his pee may actually bother him.  Think about it...  "Salt on your wound?"<br>  <br>  The hospital will give you cream like Bacitracin which is supposed to be anti-bacterial and supposed to prevent infections.  Apply a little bit of that on the penis before you wrap up the penis with gauze bandage.<br>  <br>  Do not handle the penis too roughly or try cleaning it with alcohol or baby wipes.  Let the penis heal.  Handle it very gently.|`|TJusfEnlaa	My son was done at a proper clinic and not in hospital as no doctor where i lived would do it. it cost a small fortune however.<br>  they apply a numbing cream to the penis and ask you to go away for 2 hours for the cream to work.<br>  they then take the baby away from you (i couldn't go in the room even though i wanted to) and literally five minutes later they bring him back. my boy wasn't even crying. <br>  To care for it, you need to apply alot of bedadine ointment on it at every nappy change using a cotton bud. <br>  Obviously they will pee on it but the bedadine acts as a barrier so no infection can occur.<br>  This was basically all I done. The ring fell off after about 4 days, and there have been no further complicatins, the redness disapeared withing about 2 weeks.|`|OTiLeig8aa	They will circumcise him at the hospital.<br>  <br>  Most of the time circumcision is done without numbing, because in all seriousness the pain only lasts 10 minutes and a baby boy handles it quite well.<br>  <br>  My son was not numbed and I was there during the procedure. My wife didn't want to be there as she did not want to see him cry, which is expected as women have hormones rushing through there body at this stage and are probably best not watching.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to care for, you just apply vaseline to the head of the penis after each diaper change and within a week or two, his penis will be fully healed.<br>  <br>  If poop gets on the head, just get a damp cloth and wipe it away gently.|`|tW27ELSvaa	Our pediatrician did the circumcision on our son at a week old (he had some complications and was hospitalized his first week of life). I was incredibly worried about how he would react and how I would handle it but it turned out to be nothing. they took him into another room, numbed him and put a plastic ring on it. The whole thing took maybe 20 minutes. You need to sponge bathe him until the ring falls off (yes it falls off on its own). Much to my relief he never acted as if he was in pain or sensitive to diaper changes. The ring looked a little scary falling off though. Our pediatrician said that was normal.|`|uclo2Um1aa	Please don't have that done to you son. <br>  It's really painful !<br>  NO they do not numb it !<br>   Many times they pass out from the pain and it's not needed. <br>  Leave him intact.<br>  It so barbaric to cut a part of of you sons most sensitive part of his body and change him for ever for no reason at all.<br>  Your having a perfect son . Leave him that way.

96HWpdkFaa	Ugh that makes me sick.<br>  <br>  I don't get why in the world aboritan is allowed.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I am pro choice but this is disgusting.<br>  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,488644,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,4886...</a>|`|k54YiHIeaa	I am a pro-life supporter. im soooo against abortion it pisses me off that anyone would actually choose to have an abortion. of course theres times when the mother is in danger and then that may be the only resort. but other than that its completely inhumane!!! the story you explained isnt surprising actually. once a mother goes in and tells the doctor that she wants an abortion, the doctors job is to kill that baby and dispose of it. so if she has the baby and the baby is alive the doctor has to kill it. and according to wade vs. roe court case it isnt murder. which is stupid. all babies that are aborted are never given burials. they are diposed as human wastes. i just wish ppl would realize how horrible abortions are. and i find it sad that abortion clinics make millions a year. its disgusting to think about how many abortions they do a month. (500-600) nasty.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Nooo way this is disgusting could someone post a link>??<br>  <br>  Actually i googled it, that is just so sad, can't believe she was more than halfway thru the pregnancy and was too selfish to go through with it...|`|10YksH8caa	=(, <br>  abortion=legal murder,<br>  <br>  The article says she was 23 weeks, a baby could live then..or at least had a chance....|`|O0wHfmLaaa	that is soo disgusting. i think ppl who get abortions are soo selfish...how could anyone kill their own child??|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Okay for one, you should have the facts stated in the news. She went in for a late term abortion, she was given drugs to dialate her cervix and then sent home til the time she could return to have the procedure done. <br>  When she arrived back at the clinic her cervix was dialted and yes she did end up having the baby there. It was not the doctor who actually commited the "murder" it was a nurse.<br>  <br>  Now that that is dealt with, a woman's choice is a womans' choice. It's her body! Now I am pro-choice but then again, at 23 weeks (which is how far along i am right now) i do believe it is murder. <br>  <br>  But again, it's a woman's choice, and she chose to have a late term abortion. Regardless what we think or feel, only God can judge.|`|T9fek24eaa	Wow, I didnt hear about that but I just googled the story and found it. That is sick! I hope they prosecute that doctor and put her in prison for a LONG time... and as far as the mother... UGH! Apparently it didnt matter much to her...|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Yes I read about this a week ago on Fox.  It really has a lot of pro choice, and pro life ppl up in arms about the laws.  What really peeves me is that ppl wait so long to have a baby aborted.
F6lZHRkVaa	If your wife doesn't allow you to enforce the rules the way you would like, then take a step back here. Dissociate yourself from the situation. You won't have any power over this child until the mom is willing to back you up. And many, many single moms find it hard to back up their new husbands when it comes to their child. <br>  <br>  What you should be doing right now is letting HER handle ALL of the discipline. Unless the child is directly interfering with YOU, then let her handle him completely. While you're sitting on the sidelines, be sure to praise her son to her whenever he does something good. Make sure you tell her that her son is handsome or smart or athletic or whatever it may be. Your goal right now is to assure your wife that you can see the good qualities in her son.<br>  <br>  Once you have established with your wife that you DO have her kid's best intentions in mind, then it's time to work on your relationship with him. Go out and do fun things together, take time to talk to him and tell jokes and wrestle and do whatever dads normally do with their sons. Gain his trust. Let him know that you aren't there to compete with him for his mother's attention, let him know that you truly do care about HIM regardless of if mom is around or not.<br>  <br>  Once you've gained both your wife and your stepson's trust, THEN it's time to start with the discipline. THEN you can enforce your rules with a firm but loving hand. They'll both realize that you're simply behaving like any normal parent and not actually out to get them.<br>  <br>  This process can take a very long time, so be patient. Most stepfamilies take around 7 years to really learn how to love each other and get along well. So be patient. Take a deep breath when he doesn't listen to his mom. Don't worry about being the disciplinarian right now. Work on gaining their trust.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|lzivF4Idaa	the problem isnt with the kid, its with your wife. she needs to tell him that you both equally rule and that you can take things away and punish him. she pretty much put you two on an even playing field so of course he isnt going to respect you.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Tell her"You expect me to be his father in every other except discipline.I am not going to let a 9 yr old run over me.He has been running over me and it stops tonight.I will discipline him if he needs it, for his own good and you can back me, or we can part company,your choice.I am NOT out to abuse him, I do not want him in prison before he is 18 though".<br>  If she says no, pack your things and leave.Tell her she is on her own,since she doesn't respect you and trust you enough to be a father to her son, then she should not have married you.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Try to look at it through his eyes for once...he's never had to live with another man before and now there is you. You may not realize it but that is hard thing for a child to deal with, it's a lot of changes for a 9 year old to go through. Yes I know it's hard, you can't let him disrespect you but at the same time he's not use to you telling him what to do and you are not use to telling him what to do...he's probably intimidated by you and he may not fully trust you which is why he might not want to go to bed or maybe he's jealous you get to stay with his mom or whatever, but you have to let him adjust and you have adjust to. I think a good way to figure out what works at bed time for the both you is maybe to send mom away for a night and you stay with you put him to bed and find what works and then when mom is back at the next bed time remind him of what you did when mom was away and try it while she's there maybe you could read to him or pray with him or whatever you can do to comfort him before bed. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped some.
bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	I found a website that shows tips on how to do it yourself: <a href="http://healthsufficiency.com/bronze-baby-shoes/" rel="nofollow">http://healthsufficiency.com/bronze-baby...</a><br>  <br>  Or this: <a href="http://www.truenorthbronzing.com/content/view/16/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truenorthbronzing.com/content...</a><br>  <br>  Which could probably save you money. My mother has a picture frame with a bronzed shoe and my birthstone on it. I am not sure if it's my shoe (never thought to ask) but it's so beautiful to me, I love to look at it from time to time. I think  your baby will appreciate it. The link above with the "mounted baby shoes with frames" Is what I have except I think it's one shoe. THis brings back so many memories. :D|`|AA11089301	i dunno but i bought one of those plaster kits that do impression of their foot and hand too....it was only 10 bucks and its alot more personal, it shows every line and crease, it will be great in 30 years, and thanks for reminding me i bought it and need to hurry up and use it :)|`|JP2h62qiaa	I am going to do it with my sons shoe. I did one of mine when I was in kindergarten.  we glued macaroni all over the shoe and then spray painted it bronze. That is exactly how I will do mine now minus the macaroni.

YFzprqqgaa	How much of a punk are you?  Have you taken a swing at a parent?  If so, and your in your upper teens, then the gloves are off.  If my son decides he's able to fight like a man, he can get his butt whipped like a man.  I don't believe in abusing your kids, but "time out" just doesn't work on teens.  My theory is, spank a kid a few times when their little, you won't have to when their older.  Getting my butt tore up a few times when I was little kept me from being a piece of crap when I got bigger.  Now, you realize that your a "punk" sometimes, now what are you going to do about it?  You know you force your parents hand and you know right from wrong.  Choose the right way to go.  You'll learn that you'll attract more flies with honey than vinegar.|`|IZq0IQxQaa	There are boundries. Yes, in my opinion parents sometimes resort to hitting because you can't tell a child to stop and expect them to listen, but you have to draw the line. blood, broken bones, excessive bruising is innappropriate. but them touching you to get your attention is different|`|BnhOBmUeaa	mabey because they should'nt put there anger out on u and yeah it is abuse if they are hitting u. u should talk to a relative that is trustworthy at least|`|AA10153769	i think it's clear from past answers and quesitons that i'm asian too<br>  in asian this is a common form of punishment (that is minor)<br>  it sounds a lot worse when you translate it lol<br>  western cultures (american peoples), always say this is terrible and bad and "illegal"<br>  but too bad for them, we don't care<br>  hitting in asian is like scolding in the US<br>  sounds weird huh?<br>  it's a way to instill fear and say "listen to your elders and do what we say!!!"<br>  from experience i know this ain't fun<br>  but there's nothing to really complain about it<br>  instead of a hanger, a shoe seems more popular in my family<br>  oh well<br>  i once tried to explain to my "not asian" friends and they were totally shocked, so i dropped the subject<br>  they just don't get it and i saw no point in getting them worked up<br>  that's what i had to say<br>  ^_~|`|5l2kTANaaa	They come from another generation and have other values..<br>  <br>  am not for the physical punishment though..<br>  <br>  Although i admit sometimes it way too much.

Good thing he is not anti social..<br>  <br>  Ah well...cannot think anymore..falling asleep..but it is sad if you are getting corporal punishment though......am sorry for you and your bro.

Do they mean on a "regular" basis or ever? Statistics like this are hardly trustworthy, nor are people's personal testimonies (99.9999%! Please!!!). It has been found, again, and again, that kids lie in these studies because they, even though they have been told it is confidential, still feel they need to sound as though they are doing what they believe everyone else is doing. Most honest researchers will tell you that trying to nail down teen behavior, as a group, is impossible.

I'm not trying to scare you but that's exactly how my son's RSV started and it is really common in young babies this time of year, so keep an eye on her cough. If she gets wheezy, take her to the doctor.  Something else that might help would be to turn the water on all the way hot in the shower and keep the door closed and sit in there with her.  The steam will help clear up her airways and the congestion.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Use the humidifier make sure you read the package to make sure it's ok to use with infants that young. I don't know that it is. You can always use the sucky bulb thingy to get the snot out of her nose. I know that isn't what it's called but I'm having a brain fart on what it is actually called. Aspirator I think. Anyway use that to help with the runny nose.|`|AA11707745	Yes, give her a warm bath and then have her sleep with a mentholated rub(such as Vicks) on her chest. Also, temperature change should break up the coughing, so keep the heater on in the house or have her under warm blankets, then take her out for a walk in the evening when it gets cooler. If you're nursing, to break up her congestion you could eat spicy foods and it will go through into the breastmilk as a sinus clearer.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Definitely a humidifier! The more moister the better for the baby. Also be sure to keep her warm, out of drafts etc. Also as long as she has her normal appetite I wouldn't be worried. As soon as she stops eating as much though be careful, little ones can dehydrate so fast.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Yes, definitely a humidifier will help.  cool mist is supposedlybetter than warm mist bcos of the bacteria in warm mist.  Keep an eye to make sure she doesn't get a cold, or fever.

It wasn't anything big..felt more like a lil get together with gifts lol. <br>  I feel sad, because "My" family wasn't here for it.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	My mom and sister threw one for me!  What about you?  Did you have one?|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I had 2 the one ran by my best friend and her mom was horrible...not that it was their faults but everyone canceled last min. And I had a second one when she was born with my family it was nice to pass her around...but also ackward too because my parents live on the other side of the country as me and usually I don't see these people unless my parents are there and I didn't like being the center of attention with a whole bunch of old people feeding me their child raising ways...but I survived it and was glad I had it! I cried at the end of the day with my first shower it was that bad!|`|jNErU39iaa	I didn't have a baby shower - and no, I don't feel left out at all.<br>  We chose not to find out the sex of our baby, so we bought a couple of white, green and yellow outfits.<br>  After our daughter was born, we were recieving pink and purple clothes, dresses, jumpsuits, books, toys, games, cards, etc for around 12 weeks!<br>  <br>  It was unbelievable how many people thought to buy our daughter gifts, and I could have never expected someone to host all of those people. (I'm talking over 100 gifts from 100 people) So then some people would have felt left out.<br>  <br>  And no offence to anyone, but I could never throw my own baby shower, or have a gift registry, I would just feel a little too rude.<br>  <br>  Good Question! =]|`|hSJnaysiaa	I am 36 weeks pregnant and my baby shower is not this weekend, but the next weekend (14th). At the beginning of my pregnancy, and until a few weeks ago, I adamantly did not want a baby shower. I'm not overly girly or motherly so it seemed kind of lame, and we have purchased most of our own baby stuff so had no need for gifts. WELL, then I talked to my grandma and she had been so looking forward to the baby shower for her first great-grandbaby so my cousin decided I needed to have one, and for my grandmothers happiness I will go through with it...lame games and all. But, it makes my family happy so that's what matters.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	ive got 4 kids, and never had a baby shower,,,, i wouldv liked one but hubby said we would look like tightasses,,lol,, so i never had one<br>  ive been to many baby showers and i wish i had one, but in a way dont really care as when i had my kids i got tonnes of gifts anyway<br>  <br>  plus if i go to a baby shower i tend to spend a bit less on the babies birth pressy, cos its 2 gifts in a few months,,lol|`|OWReYgV5aa	I had three for my baby girl 9 years ago, one by family, one by coworkers and one at my husband's work.  Now I'm having a boy, and my husband and I both work out of our home *(he works temp jobs)and don't have enough close friends around that would throw one...and I am not sure if my family is going to throw me one or not.  I really was looking forward to having one, though, and I hope I do!!  But if not, that's ok, but it makes me feel a little disappointed.<br>  <br>  Actually, you get alot of gifts at showers that you don't want or use, so I think sending out announcements afterward might be better, then people will send money and you can just get what you want!!|`|DBKV3g4baa	My baby shower was this past Sunday, and was hosted by my mom, the boy's mom, and a close friend.  <br>  <br>  I am 38 weeks pregnant, and though it was only a 3 hour event, it was completely exhausting.  I would definitely recommend planning a baby shower for a bit earlier in the pregnancy.|`|giRRCXU4aa	I had a baby shower. My best friend had it for me.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I had one. It was a lot of fun and really helpful. My mom and friend had it for me.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	I didn't have one for my first. I really wanted one but no one even mentioned it, not even my mom. And this was going to be her first grandbaby. However, I did have one for my second. But honestly I didn't even want one. My aunt threw it for me. I really didn't need anything since I had kept pretty much everything from my first. And I know I might sound ungrateful, but I didn't even enjoy it.|`|BKbEE9qZaa	First child yes. Second child no. My mom was going to set it up but she made a comment that I still can't get over so I'm not really talking to her. She never followed up on it and neither did I. I feel bad for not throwing one myself though.|`|skSzDIlwaa	i had one it was by my mom and my moms best friend. but if you didn't get a baby shower then you can make your own. thats what my friend did when she wanted a baby shower.|`|ImOgCILSaa	i had one. it was given by my sister and law and a friend and my mom. i felt bad because its saying BUY ME STUFF but its also tradition i guess. it really helped with baby needs though and it was way fun|`|F7i4heAcaa	I had 2. One by my sis and mom and another by a friend.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I did.<br>  <br>  It was thrown by my mom and best friend.
786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	Personally, I would let her know how much I appreciate her gesture but add that unfortunately I can't use them because of his chubby tummy. That the last couple of packs you have used in emergencies, which has been a great help, but you thought that you would let her know the situation.  Maybe buy her a bunch of flowers as a thank you, it will help show how much you appreciate what she is trying to do, and let her know you aren't trying to hurt her feelings.  She would feel worse if she ever found out that you donated them because you didn't tell her about it.|`|MduCpAWOaa	i would tell her especially if she does it all the time i would say " thank you so much 4 buying us diapers but we dont use these anymore the key is anymore because if u say we dont use these then she may think okay so i have been giving u these diapers and you have not used any of them.  then maybe she might say o well  what kind do u use.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Give them away to the needy or use them for cleaning windows (seriously). Or make diaper cakes!!! They are fun. :)|`|oFpJV6A1aa	stores nowadays let u exchange products without a receipt...u only need them to get a full refund...just walk into a supermarket and say ur husband bought the wrong brand and u wanna exchange...lol...it works...|`|UjFgWnfBaa	Say thank you and either donate them to somebody, exchange them if you know where they bought them. If they give them to you frequently you can just let them know that he is growing fast and needs a certain size. (If its the brand, you can always say you use a certain brand because the others give the baby a diaper rash)|`|S8Qpiabdaa	just let her theres always a good shelter that wont mind em coming in so think of it this way ur helping some one that cant afford em never tell some one no thats being nice to ur kid i learned that one along time a go kids come first|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Just say, lately he has been peeing out of this brand of diapers, so i started using pampers and they seem to work better.
lCwE9QP5aa	You don't have to hold your baby all the time to feel like you are not neglecting her. Trust me, I have a friend who felt bad if she wasn't holding her baby boy all the time & right in his face every second & now he is 2 & he screams all the time to be held & when he wants something & she still has to rock him to sleep. Although 3 months is still young enough that it is OK to hold them a lot.  It definitely does your baby some good to lay on a blanket on the floor to play or it gives her an opportunity to work on rolling over & things like that. If you are in the same room & keeping an eye on her it is not neglect. Do you have a swing you could put her in or a pack and play? Or maybe a sling so she could lay against you  but you are still free to study? Good luck-|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Um, at 3 months you should still be holding her a lot.  I started back school when my son was 8 months.  I made sure he got a good 2 or 3 hour  nap during day and I did A LOT then.  And 2 more hours after he was in bed.  3 classes are totally doable.  Take time on the weekends, breaks at work.  Who watches her when you're at school and work?  Is there a way you can study when she's next to you.  You're still with her, can be interactive and maybe do a little review.  Good luck, you are really steppin up to make sure you're providing the best for the both of you!|`|iQcd37Goaa	well it won't hurt your baby to play by your side..but if you feel bad cuz you don't hold her buy the straps and carry him on your chest but keep studying is going to be the best for your baby when your done..i think your doing great!!|`|z0Ac06claa	At three months you should still hold her a lot. Maybe get a sling so you can keep her close to you and study. Congrats on the baby and still going to school. Good luck to you.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Hold her and do your work at the same time.  Hard? Yes.  Impossible? No.  Babies need to be held.  If your GPA goes down, so be it.  At least you'll have a degree.|`|rGuFWbKUaa	Babies really do need tummy time but do not let anyone tell you what to do with your child. Just find a way to push through and it will be worth it. I promise a little belly time will not hurt your baby. Just think what 15-30 minutes a day could do for your classes? If you did a little at a time then it doesn't appear a big deal and it becomes a routine.|`|910b90efc9722085e6a7e3477af0c73aaa	Do you have a friend that can come over and keep the baby company for a few hours a week while you study?

I am a full time student as well. I am taking 4 classes right now. I know what you are going through. I hold my daughter all the time still and when she is napping my son is awake and wanting to play with mommy. So I never have time to do the work. When my husband comes home from work I he takes her for about ten minutes so I can do some quick catch up on school work. Then while I am cooking I work a little more on it while the food is on the stove. My husband is pretty good about keeping the kids for SHORT periods at a time to help out. <br>  <br>  Good luck...hang in there.
kaqPSgTVaa	Your circulation in pregnancy is greatly decreased and considering how far along you are it's probably magnified by how the big the baby is when you sit that way. You should be fine and I would be surprised if it's not from poor circulation.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I found these two sites that mention hip numbness...It sound like it isn't uncommon.

Hf5doDxsaa	I have a Graco travel system and I love it.  Yeah you have to get a car seat soon, but don't you have to do that anyway?|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I know I would not have cared too much for a convertible seat early on. I prefer the smaller seat specifically for her age/weight. Something so bulk would get in the way, and whens he's little the last thing you wanna be doing is pulling them in and out of a seat. It's easier to just keep them in a smaller seat and carry around. Now that she is 8 months I wouldn't mind a convertible. She's too heavy to carry the seat around now unless she is asleep and I don't wanna bother her. We usually just pull her out of it and carry her around.<br>  <br>  I have a jogger travel system that we really like. It's just neat and the stroller fits well in the trunk of my Cavalier. It's convenient when I'm alone. The stroller will last us a while as she gets older she can still fit in it. And it'll be great for us to walk around the neighborhood with when it warms up. It folds up really easily with the quick pull of two little red triggers by the handle. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5621878" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=52122495&albumID=1641181&imageID=34875982" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a>|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	I dont know how old your baby is and how big he/she is but  there are several travel systems with good size seats..if yoru child is almost ready for a foreward facing seat but you'd like to get something easier to deal with than a stroller and a carseat i'd probably suggest the 5 in one carseat.stroller... <a href="http://www.mytravelingbuddy.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=MTB&Product_Code=801" rel="nofollow">http://www.mytravelingbuddy.com/Merchant...</a><br>  i wish i knew about these earlier i would have investedin one.. <br>  Triple Play Sit n Stroll<br>  <br>  <br>  The AMAZING 5–in–1 Travel System<br>  <br>  Simplify your life with the innovative, award-winning Sit ‘n’ Stroll car seat/stroller combination.

And even when you ask people's advice, you get so many different opinions. <br>  <br>  I chose not to get a convertible seat because you can't carry it around. And when a baby is small, you will be carrying it around in a car seat a lot. We will just have to buy her a bigger seat when she grows out of it, but by then the new baby that's on the way now will be able to use the old one ...<br>  <br>  As far as a travel system goes, I got one. I have used the stroller part a few times, but not too often.  But that's just me; other people may use their big strollers all the time.<br>  <br>  I finally figured out that there is no right and wrong with this baby stuff. Everyone has an opinion, but you just have to jump in and make the best choice you can and you'll be fine!<br>  <br>  (PS, unless your baby is huge, you will not have to buy a new car seat at 6 months.)|`|bc9inzicaa	I have a Chicco Keyfit 30--but just the car seat.  I opted not to get the system due to multiple factors: I hated the bulkiness of the system; I received a stroller from my baby shower already (so purchasing another one was pointless); and my son was born in winter so i figured i would not be strolling him around town anytime soon.<br>  <br>  I got the Chicco after doing my research.  It had the highest safety ratings and great consumer reviews.  My son is only two months old, but already weighs about 15 lbs and 24 inches so i am going to start my research on a convertible car seat in hopes that he can be kept rear facing for as long as possible.  I have heard some good things about the Britax Marathon, but have not really looked into it yet.  <br>  <br>  If you do get a car seat, I would recommend Chicco--you do pay more, but your child's safety is worth it (plus it is so simple to get the car seat in and out of the base).|`|OWReYgV5aa	I used a convertible one when I had my first baby and I always thought it wasn't convenient and if I could do it again, I would go for the carrier/travel system.  So this time, that's what I'm doing.  I'll just spend the money down the road and buy a bigger seat when needed.  I think it's worth it.  Mainly because everytime I use to have to get my baby out, she would wake up...this way, she can just keep sleeping..how nice!!<br>  <br>  NOt all travel systems are expensive, the one I'm getting is Safety 1st at Target...and it's a great price.  What you can do is go looking and take notes, then come home and look up the review on it.  That worked for me!|`|JP2h62qiaa	a convertible car seat is more convenient. My son got too big for the infant carrier by 4 months old, I think. He is on his 3rd car seat already and he is 15 months old.   I enjoy the cosco scenera.  They make the convertible and a high back booster. Good luck.<br>  Oh not every infant carrier will snap into shopping carts well, but they are so handy.|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	I have been going through the same dilemma, until I spoke to a friend of mine that is a purchasing order clerk for a baby store.  She said not to go with the travel systems, because of a variety of reasons.  Her first point is that it is costly and unless you intend to use it for multiple children it becomes a massive waste of money, because you will need to buy a carseat at six months anyways. <br>  <br>  Her other point was more interesting, and the one that made me stop and rethink my idea choice.  The Australian Safety Standards say that babies should not be in the travel systems for long periods of time (so can't use shopping, or long distances in the car, etc), not more than 1/2 an hour use per time. Why? Because they are designed to curve the baby's back, which is not healthy for them at all.<br>  <br>  She did say that while the car seats are bulky you can buy ones where you can adjust the seat so the baby is in fact in more of a laying position, so it can be adjusted as necessary for their age.<br>  <br>  Considering these facts, it appears that the travel systems are not worth the money.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I use the Chicco, Keyfit 30.  Its kinda more expensive than reg brands but they can use them til 30 pounds, which can be past a year.  They're cute and fold up nice and are light.<br>  <br>  With my first I had a evenflo or something and it was horrible.  and I went through a few car seats.|`|ydy6W0sXaa	If you have a Graco car seat, you can get a frame that'll attach to the car seat.  I think I paid $80 for the frame at Babys R Us.<br>  <br>  Not all of us can afford to pay $800 for a Bugagboo Chameleon travel system.|`|fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	Well... In my opinion, the only advantage to a travel system is that you can take your sleeping baby undisturbed from his/her pram and put them straight into the car by unattaching the carseat from the pram.  Because I'm pretty sure almost all of these carseats in the travel systems are ones with fixed bases that you have to attach in your car, so if you out and planning to take a cab or a friend is driving you home or whichever then your carseat is useless because that fixed base is in your car.  Travel systems tend to be a lot more expensive that regular strollers, but I guess if you factor in buying a separate stroller and a separate carseat it might be the same or even a better price.  You might want to check up on any new laws regarding car seats and if you indeed need a new one, carseat stores should definately know about new laws.  I'm not all that fond of Chicco, to be honest, I have never had a chicco product that I have been satisfied with.  But in regards to car seats you cant go wrong with maxi-cosi....they are really top notch, top of the line in regards to safety.<br>    Look, ther are a lot of strollers that are compatible with maxi-cosi carseat, why don't you buy a stroller that is compatible with a maxi-cosi (there should be a list on the maxi-cosi website, or in a stroller store they'll tell you)  and if you like the travel system keep the seat on, if not, then leave it in the car.  Just remember to ask the salesperson if your baby can use the stroller at all ages without the use of the carseat, because with many actual travel systems you have to use the carseat attachment.<br>  <br>  I will tell you that if you can afford it I think the 'Jane Matrix cup travel system' is amazing because it has two carseats in one....you have to see to believe it....check it out online..<br>  <br>  a cheaper version of exactly the same idea is the Nurse Dakaar cup system.<br>  <br>  Good luck
BO28Mn8haa	Yikes. You should watch your periods from now on, make sure they are regulated, and get an ovulation kit. When you are at your peak ovulation days, then go for it. Remember it's all about charting your dates and knowing your body. Good luck.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	If you're losing inches but not pounds, it probably means that you're building muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat, so if you lose fat, but build muscle, you'll weigh the same (but be smaller).  Maybe your arms are stronger than you think from carrying that baby around.  :-)<br>  <br>  In the meantime, just keep trying to get some exercise and eat healthy.  The pounds will drop off eventually.|`|P7VdWn7baa	I am just wondering how much you weigh, because I am not loosing any weight.I weigh alot 230 and I just gave up. I lost all that i gained during my pregnancy but nothing else. I am not really worried, because when I stop breastfeeding I will go on a diet. But we cannot diet while breastfeeding just eat healthy. GL|`|vZvCnYcCaa	Why is the number important to you?  If you're losing inches, that's really all that matters.  The only thing I would suggest would be to workout.  That might make you drop pounds, but you only gave birth 2 months ago.  I wouldn't worry about how much you weigh right now....<br>  <br>  good luck|`|uGqYoZNEaa	You shouldn't care how much you weigh, just how you look in your clothes.  The water retention may be from pg still.  I don't remember a hug enotice after I stopped breastfeeding.  You can start working out, just don't over due it.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	do sits up !|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Weight Watchers online (weightwatchers.ca in Canada or weightwatchers.com in the US) has a program for breastfeeding mothers.  Worked great for me when I was nursing my first.|`|IXJ1FzJMaa	since you're breast feeding the weight should come off on its own but if it doesn't try some crunches in the morning while they are still sleeping and if you have cox cable got to on demand then click on free zone, the health and fitness and there are free exercise videos of you're choice. good luck
AA10458750	Omega 3 is also called DHA. You can buy Expecta Lipil DHA gels at Wal-Mart...they are only $9 for a 30 day supply. Also, you can ask the Dr. to give you a prescription for a prenatal vitamin w/ DHA in it.|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Eggland's Best eggs have Omega 3 fatty acids and taste great. They do cost more than the 'store' brand but are extra large and sometimes on sale.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	No, you can eat salmon.  Just not fish that has a lot of mercury in it.  they should have given you a list of not ok fish.  If you're feelin funny about it, use pills.
846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	don't rush the sippy cup transition.  They actually don't have to be exclusively on cups by one year like some people say.  My daughter hated them too, and I just  reduced the number of times a day she got a bottle, till she had no choice but drink form a cup or thirst herself to peices.  It took a while, but she got the point.  I will say that once she starts using sippy cups, hide all bottles where she can't see them or get rid of them all together.  My daughter, after about 1 month of decreasing bottle frequency, finally broke down and used the cup because she was that thirsty, but I did allow her to use bottles at night for a while after that because that was one fight I wasn't ready for (she wailed half the night the first time I tried to take it away at bedtime).  She was about 18 months old before she got rid of bottles completely, but by then I had a newborn, and couldn't get rid of the bottles.  She never tried to take his though.  But once I got him off bottle, I got rid of every bottle in the house.  Out of sight, out of mind.<br>  <br>  Just don't rush it, she will do it when she is ready with a little gentle caoxing from her family.  You could also try the new sippy cups that are a little like bottles.  And letting her drink from regular cups, from time to time, or when you have something to drink.  She naturally wants to copy mommy and siblings, so encourage her that way.  When she drinks from a cup, make a big girl happy fuss, so she sees it's what makes you happy, which will make her happy.  It helped with my girl and boy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I had a heck of a time with my son, he stopped nursing on his own but wouldn't drink from anything but a bottle until he was nearly 2 I started offering him the sip cup every morning until finally he took it. There was no real pressure, if he said no or threw it down I gave him the bottle instead, eventually he took the sippy but the only one he would take was the soft top nuby ones. If you haven't tried them yet get some, of all the kids I know this is the most popular one for kids who wont use sippy cups. <br>  <br>  Your baby is still pretty young so you may need to just wait awhile and keep offering it without pressure, I promise no matter what she wont take a bottle with her to kindergarten, she will switch when she is ready.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I'm going through the same thing with my 8 month old daughter and I want to wean her off the bottle before age 1. I guess I'll have to keep trying to let her figure it out and wait til she's ready.|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	it could be that she may not be ready and putting it off for a while may help.<br>  <br>  I have seen children who go straight to normal plastic drinking cups because they hate the feel of the lid of sippy cups in their mouths. <br>  <br>  The hardest part, is as a mother you get the impression that your baby should be doing certain things, but remember they are little people and don't run on what they should or shouldn't be doing|`|CpWGvDvRaa	<a href="http://www.viewpoints.com/Nuby-No-Spill-Drinking-Cup-review-3f6a" rel="nofollow">http://www.viewpoints.com/Nuby-No-Spill-...</a><br>  <br>  This is the BEST one, IMO. We used this and daughter has been off bottle since 1 year. <br>  <br>  She even drinks from a real cup now and is 16 months.|`|yN9aEZKmaa	the nuby brand sippy cups with the silicone tops were my best friend for this transition.  the spout is very flexable, like a bottle, but is shaped like a sippy cup.
uFrqC4Y2aa	That's a normal concern. The chances are soooooo slim. One in a million.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	no.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I suppose it's possible, but very unlikely unless he actually ejaculated right before touching you, allowing for some semen to actually get in there. Actual sex definitely isn't the only way you can get pregnant, but I highly doubt that you could be pregnant from what you guys did. Good luck and don't worry!|`|Z08iVuGJaa	Yes it is possible. However, the chances of you getting pregnant from this is so so small.<br>  <br>   In your cycle there is only a 72 hour a month window that a woman can get pregnant. <br>  <br>  But if it is worrying you then talk to your boyfriend about it, or your mum. If you feel you can't do this then speak to a doctor or get a pregnancy test.|`|bdmRHIaZaa	As long as he did not *** on his fingers and then finger you, your straight.  You have to have semen inside a vagina to get pregnant.  Dont worry your safe..|`|lZO3kfoyaa	No very unlikely|`|J1b9rucuaa	Chances are slim to none. You're good to go. Don't worry.
zf8gqN2Faa	So fun to cuddle indeed, but if the time has come--prepare yourself!<br>  The good news is that it doesn't have to be hard. At worst it will take a few days.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of ways to accomplish your goal of having him go down and stay down, but I find simple behavior modification will work best.<br>  <br>  Start by introducing him to his crib. Take him to his room throughout the day and point out his bed. Put him in it and stand him up for a few minutes at a time during "awake time".<br>  When it's time to go to bed tell him so. Don't spend alot of time in there with him.<br>  Put him in the crib. Tell him you love him.Walk Away.<br>  Turn off the lights and only leave door ajar a few inches. Wait outside.<br>  He will cry. Be patient. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't let him cry for more than 10 minutes, but when you go in, you have to lay him down and tell him you love him and that he has to sleep in his big boy bed. Leave the room. Wait another ten...<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, you'll need to start yourself in the room with him and slowly get out of that room until he's going to sleep alone. This is much harder b/c you have to stick to a plan and literally take away a very few minutes per week or so over time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|S8Qpiabdaa	wow u should of never of done that. never let them lay with u. all my kids slept in there cribs by there self i would feed em then turn of the light and walk away by 3 months they would sleep at 7 or 8 pm all night, go me!! its gonna be hell but feed him and walk away go to another room he will eventully cry himself to sleep it sounds bad but its life thats how u teach em start as early as possible and dont give up or give in nothing will happen to him hes safe in the crib for now on starting tonight lay him down and go every night !! good luck !|`|LoO9LptJaa	I'm not a mother, but I think that you could try giving him a little gift, such as a new blanket or stuffed animal, and allowing him to use it while he's in his new crib =] This will make him associate being in his crib with something which makes him happy! You could even put a picture of yourself and him beside the crib to remind him you're still there, and maybe try positioning the crib so that he can still see you as he sleeps until he gets used to the transition! Mobiles and other things with music can also help calm him! Goodluck?|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Create a nighttime routine, whether it is pj's, bottle, stories, or bath, pj's and cuddling in HIS room etc. Stick to the same consistent routine each and every night. Put him down in his crib. Rub his back, tell him you love him, turn out the lights and leave. If he cries, check back in 15 minutes, but do not stay for more then 60 seconds. Repeat as necessary. The first night (or three) maybe horrible, but if you can be consistent you will have a great sleeper in a week. Do not respond to his behaviors by putting him in bed with you or you have negated all of the work you will be doing. For example, if he were to make himself throw up, go in, clean it up as quickly as possible, rub his back, and get right back to the process. Some people will say this is harsh or unacceptable to them as a parent, but teaching our kids to sleep on their own is an important skill. Good Luck!|`|9GcjDIqNaa	At least he's not like me when I was a baby lol. I kicked the crib gates out and crawled out. My parents would find me every time. I think you should give him a play mobile and some milk. (That's how I fell asleep... But not today lol) <br>  <br>  I cried almost every second of the day... I hope he gets better :)|`|dnAIE30waa	Let him cry it out. It will be tough on you both but usually by the 3rd night they calm down. It won't hurt him. I suggest doing it over a weekend.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	try to find a toy he likes, gentle music, etc... make sure his crib is closeby to your bed so he is comfortable and knows your there.|`|mH7aaHEcaa	I had the same problem with my daughter. Try putting him in his crib and patting his back, he'll probably fight you at first but after a couple weeks he'll get used to it then you can progress to just having your hand on him to finally just being in the room and finally to just laying him down and him falling asleep all by himself. That was the only thing that worked for us, that cry it out method did not work at all.|`|ajMpijRJaa	Well you don't just want to put him in a bed then shut the door. lol. that wouldn't be good. You need to slow the transition down. Maybe lay down with him until he falls asleep. Play smooth jazz or bedtime music for children. Something to get him to relax. Its going to take some time. But don't worry. it will work. <br>  <br>  i hope some of the links work.|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	a technique I have seen used from a friend of mine, is to get a chair beside the cot.  You put him in the cot, tuck him in, after reading him a story, then say good night.  You put a night light on, and then you sit in the chair, and don't make eye contact.  The baby can then see you, and know you are close.  They will cry, and if they get hysterical you tuck them back in and give them a kiss, and then sit in the chair again. It is important, apparently, not to talk to them.  You just sit there until they fall asleep.  Each night it gets easier, because they are assured that mum is not very far away.  This technique, I was told can take a couple of weeks but, the baby's cry is never the way it is the first night, because that first night they are afraid that mum won't be there, gradually they understand that you aren't far away.  <br>  <br>  My other bit of advice, is if the baby is used to being in your room, I would put the cot in your room to begin with.  Then the baby is going to sleep in surrounds that he is used to.|`|yN9aEZKmaa	it sucks, but I had both of my kids cry it out. after about a week there were no more tears(and there were less and less each night until then). now they won't go to sleep any other way(and we all get a better night's sleep).<br>  <br>  p.s.if you decide to go this route, you've got to stick with it. otherwise, you will have made your kid cry for no reason.|`|GBBU65jkaa	It may seem unnatural, but let him cry himself to sleep. Trust me, it's the best thing to do. You will want to take him out of the crib and bring him back with you, but you must persevere. In a few weeks or so, there should be no crying whatsoever when you put him in his crib.|`|PYI5VVibaa	sneak a little bourbon into his bottle|`|PRCeGIGaaa	go to youtube.com/balaboocha and watch the video craige and michael, then tell your friends
AA10458750	Did you go to the same place? If you weren't happy with the results, you shoul have told them. Regular ultrasounds you expect to be blurry, but expensive 3-Ds should not.
692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	lol, your day sucked!<br>  <br>  And she probably sensed your frustration and panic, so she naturally acts out as well :)  <br>  <br>  Ive always noticed when im having the horrible days, my son is crankier and mean.. but when i think about it, my usual calm tone was probably irritated and not so calm lol<br>  <br>  Tomorrow will be better and so will Piper :)<br>  <br>  I love that name, it reminds me of Charmed lol|`|FZq6FT3Vaa	The joys of motherhood!  :o)   I agree, at times mine choose the worst times to be cranky too, but what can ya really do!?|`|786fd6feb77011e060f5955437a24ac9aa	Babies react to what is around them, and it sounds to me like she was reacting to your stress today.  That she could not settle because you were stressed, and this is why it appears to be bad timing.<br>  <br>  If you need to calm her and aren't sure what to do, put a chamomile teabag in her bath, and the chamomile tea, while not have the strong properties of essential oils, is a natural calming agent.  <br>  <br>  I also found, with my two, on particularly stressful days, putting relaxation or classical music on helps both the baby and me.  The gentleness of the music had a calming effect on  me and the baby, and the baby was able to stay settled because I had settled from being stressed out.<br>  <br>  Maybe on days like today, put off the errands instead of adding stress to the situation, you don't need to put that onto yourself.|`|Drze0cUXaa	woah, well sounds like you had a bad day! My daughter chooses to be a little stinker at the worst times too. When I am up getting ready for work at 6 am she wakes up &  cries because she knows I'm leaving & her dad doesn't want to get up that early. She also LOVES to whine and be held when I am trying to do my school work, so I can't get anything done. But the worst is how she wants to breastfeed ALL the time! Ohh yeah the joys of mother hood, but I wouldnt trade it for anything :)|`|NXodF671aa	Sometimes life throws you a curve ball. In your case, it looks like life thought you'd enjoy a tournament. I have to say that yes, babies do choose the worst times to be cranky butts, and it usually coincides with when we're short on fuses. I think without those days though, we'd forget how awesome they are the rest of the time.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	My daughter almost never fusses except to let us know it is time to eat, sleep or play and stops immediately once you either meet the need or distract her, LOL.  However, when she does choose to completely lose it, it is always at the worst times (when we are out and about or just wiped out).  I think it is a universal experience to parenthood; it's not just you.
ZbnxGIsnaa	You very well could be dear.  I just found out I am pregnant and I had and still have tons of creamy white discharge.  =)|`|GEfpzUNvaa	you could be... count 10-12 days after you ovulation day and take a pg test that day if you don't want disappointment then wait till you Miss your period...|`|erKyfwSbaa	It is possible. I had increased cm right before the date my period was due and I was pregnant. I would check it out for STD only if it is itchy or has an unusual order or texture.<br>  Try to be patient. You can test in a couple days, just hold on!|`|7wVKW3l1aa	Yes it could be pregnancy,Since you had sex on ovulation day your chances should be high...Baby dust to you!!!! I would prolly test if AF doesnt come the 13th

(completely normal)|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	thats normal i was exactly like u|`|lFzXZQQDaa	It's normal to have maternal instincts! After all, you are a soon to be mother, you should be getting excited! and that's perfectly okay! =)|`|oiJITSNZaa	Maternal insticts can affect this. Also if you aren't going to start till later, I would advise getting on with your life and getting involved in something else. Otherwise when things don't happen as soon or as planned, you are so let down and depressed. Good Luck!
SaRDq9iLaa	When I was sick I asked my daughter's pediatrician because I breastfeed.  He told me that I could take Benadryl.  Hope you feel better!|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I have considered it... been miserable enough to, but I didn't do it. First of all it was expired haha, and secondly I used to be SO paranoid about my milk supply and any effects on my daughter so I tried to stay away from medicine although I did suck it up and take Sudafed which is very 50/50 with supply. <br>  <br>  I trust kellymom and I think their research is very accurate so if you want to take I would but in moderation, only when you just really really need it.|`|ybzD9s9raa	Yes you can. It is safe during pregnancy, being that it is a category B drug, meaning that is safe.. I think it will be fine, just everything in moderation. I think you should try the liquid children's benedryl and just take the children's' dosage.. It is a smaller amount and should still help with the symptoms you are suffering from.. Hope this helps!!|`|PymLdXM8aa	yes you can. Benadryl is also one of the few medications you can take while pregnant also. YOu can take Benadryl i know first hand because i had to take it because i have bad allergies during the spring nd summer and the doctor said in moderation it was fine. GL and hope this helps!|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	Ask your doctor, I wouldn't think that it's okay because what ever you eat and drink will go right to the baby through your breast milk. Even pills like Benadryl|`|oiJITSNZaa	It can affect different people and different babies different ways. If I were you I would ask my doctor...you don't want to risk your baby's well-being.

AA10458750	If you had sex on the 25th and you were about due to ovulate only 3 days sooner, it's very likely you are pregnant. Ovualtion predictors can be up to a week off! Not everybody ovualtes exactly 14 days after their cycle....so every woman is different there is no way anythign can predict it. Wait and see if you are late then take the test!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I never knew or looked at ovulation.  I was on pill BOTH times with #1 and #2.  With this one I wasn't on anything but my pd was very regular and it was not during a safe time.|`|AA10244380	It hasn't happened to me yet!<br>  <br>  I chart my cycle using www.mymonthlycycles.com and so far it's very accurate with me.  It DOES state not to use it to prevent pregnancy, but I must say that when I look at their calendar and compare my what my body is doing (different types of discharge, etc...) it's been dead on.  <br>  <br>  It's probably too early to test, but I took my pregnancy test 4 days before my period was due and got a positive.  That was 3 years ago, and I used that same website to get pregnant. That worked too!|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I'm 18 weeks along with a "safe time" baby.  Very excited because we were going to start trying for number two in a few months anyway.  Just happened a little earlier than planned.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to get pregnant, you want to have sex before you ovulate.  If you wait until after you ovulate its too late.  (If you ovulate on day 14 start having sex on day 10.  If you don't have sex until day 15 it might be too late.)<br>  <br>  Buy an ovulation predictor test -- the type you pee on!  That will help you figure out when you ovulate.  You'll find one at your local drug store near the pregnancy tests.<br>  <br>  Wait until the 8th to take the test.  You'll get more accurate results then because you'll have more of the pregnancy hormone in your urine.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	There is no such thing as a "safe time" or "safe zone". <br>  <br>  If you have unprotected sex, there is always a possibility you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you tested now, you could get a pretty accurate answer.
YnLqItJPaa	I have a very slight case of PUPPPS, and for me, it's basically like painful little zit-looking blisters here and there on my legs that sometimes get itchy.  I don't think that joint pain and/or swelling are normally associated with it, as it's really just a skin thing.  Checking with your OB/GYN may be a good idea.  It almost sounds like you're having an allergic reaction to something.  Did you start taking a prenatal with something in it you haven't taken before?<br>  <br>  Of course, the swelling you're experiencing could just be water retention... Bloating is VERY common in early pregnancy.|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	I never heard of this until I saw your question.  I looked it up on several sites but saw nothing about swelling or pain.  They also say the rash is itchy not painful.  I don't know what the sites you visited said.  I strongly suggest you see you obgyn asap to find out what's going on.|`|NQRq11i4aa	I would definately see your OB.  I've actually never heard of PUPPPS before so I don't have a clue...sorry darlin.  Good Luck!|`|qxnZXOVFaa	the arm pain could be caused by carpal tunnel.  it's a symptom of pregnancy even though a lot of people don't know it.  i had PUPPS during the later stages of pregnancy.  i know it can be a burden, but my doctor couldn't give me anything for it because i had hypertension.  benedryl is safe to take during pregnancy, so that might help.  but definitely ask your OB before taking it just to make sure.  some OB/GYN's have different views on over the counter drugs.  my OB told me that he was my primary doctor while i was pregnant, so i made sure i told him everything that was going on.  you really need to go to your OB and tell him/her that you have PUPPPS and see what they can do for it.  i know how horrible it is and i still have a few scars from all the scratching, but tell your OB now and maybe you won't have to go through all that.  best of luck to you and your family!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would call and ask your OB what she thinks. She might get you in to look at you and help you out if you want a second opinion.
SlBsJ3NRaa	My youngest is almost 11 months and it's touch and go when it comes to sleeping. Sometimes, I get to sleep from 10pm until 8am with no interruptions. Other times (more often then not) I'm up at least once or twice in that time span. <br>  <br>  Supposedly growth spurts can be to blame for older infants/toddler sleep interruptions. Whatever it is, I hope it ends soon.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Both my children were that way. My mom told me that if you can survive the first the six months, you can do it all.  But that was not the case for me and my little kiddlies!!  They didnt sleep through the night until they were almost two years old!!  And while i tried the crying thing, it didnt work and i just had to wait it out.  In fact, i may be a bad mom for it, but i still had to give my kids bottles in the middle of the night to make them go back to sleep.  But relatively soon after a year old they began to sleep more at night.  I had to really crank down on being a tough mom and i had to be less affectionate at night. Be patient and be diligent and eventually things WILL get better for you.  If your child has to eat at night, start offering less and less food until all they get is a glass of water. Soon they will learn its not worth waking up in the middle of the night for water and less love from mommy.  its okay!  Things will get easier for you!!  Just hang tight and know that you are not alone, i went through the exact same thing!!|`|OZjOqI43aa	my son is 3 years old now, and he didn't start sleeping all through the night til 18 months. I would have to get up and reassure him that i was still there and tuck him back in with his favorite blanket. we also gave in and let him  have a sippy in bed (only water) and it was always full in the morning, he just liked holding his sippy. He still does sometimes sleep with it, but how i see it if it helps him sleep all night, then i see no problem!! good luck, he will eventually start sleeping all night :)|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My son didnt sleep through the night until he was about 18 months, he would wake up atleast once a night sometimes up to 3 times!

My friend who has a 3 month old sleeps 7 hours straight, its not fair.   All you can do is wait :(|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	My son will be one in 2 days and the only time he doesn't sleep through the night is when he looses his pacifier and we have to help him find it. But he seems find all the other nights.|`|jcXSNjowaa	I was lucky with my boys they slept through the night.<br>  <br>  one of my friends babies is one yr old and wakes up every hour.<br>  i think this is more common with breastfed babies|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	My son is 16 months and a half and started to sleep through the night 3 months ago. He was waking up in the middle of the night since he first was born and would stay up 4 hours. It was stressing me out. But I used to think mayb he wasn't full. So after h turned about one years old I made sure he ate enough then b4 I knew it he was sleeping through the night. Ur son will sleep through the night tire him out during the day and give him a nap that should work.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	My daughter goes to bed at 8, wakes up at 12, I pat her and she falls asleep until 5, I breastfeed her and then she gets up at 8 again.<br>  <br>  My son slept through the night at 3 months as well.  I guess every baby is just different.  I do notice that when I'm at home and we do regular stuff she sleeps a lot better.|`|IXJ1FzJMaa	After you feed him dinner give him a warm bath and put toys in the bathtub so he can play until he starts to wine that means he's ready to get out. while you are putting his jammie's on have you're husband fix him some warm milk heat for 30 - 45 seconds in the microwave. put him in his crib with the bottle. i guarantee he will sleep through the night.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Even my four month old sleeps all night! I got mine learning young that just because they cry doesn't mean they get held or fed during the night and it sure is worth a few nights of crying because before long they sleep all night! 10-12 hours. Good luck
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	zinc lozenges helped me alot.  that and my vitamins.  menthol cough drops.  it would also depend on if you're coughing or not and if it's a mucusy cough.  if it's mucusy, you don't want cough suppressants you want expectorants.  and if it's not mucusy then suppressants would be the way to go.  the reason why is that the suppressant could actually keep you from coughing up the mucus and you could get sicker.  if you're congested you can use saline drops buy or make using 1 quarter tsp salt to one cup water. nettie pots work well too.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	to prevent getting a cold dont shake hands with people with a cold or dont share towel etc anything that might have secretions from thier nose or mouth. you can also get a flu vaccine though your child is too young for it.... and if you get it wear a simple probably disposible surgical mask when handling the baby or atleast dont bring your face close to him. and wash your hands before touching him/her. if you get it u can always take over the counter flu medicine and paracetamol but you probably know that...:)|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	remedies doesn't help enough... microbial dust needs to be focused too.. I had cold and looking after a child too since infant.. what makes a difference to change the sneeze is to dust-off the room regularly.. we adults are getting sensitive to dust.. get your ma or hubby to regularly sweep the floor, wipe up all dust .. it really works..! really! i sneeze lesser.. don forget.. you are still under that post natal period.. wear long-sleeve clothing, try not to consume too much fluid as that also makes it difficult to shrink that tummy down later.don get too near the fan.|`|AA10458750	You can take zinc lozenges to help shorten the length of the cold. They have them in walmart for less than $4 a box. Once you are feeling better, stop taking them or your body gets use to them. And to stay healthy, best defense is hand washing and hand sanitizer when you can't do that.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Take echinacea and golden seal! This won't heal your cold your already getting but within a couple weeks in your system will boost your immune system. One winter I took it faithfully every day and every couple months took a 1 week break from it as advised and I went the whole winter with no colds, no flu! Also Ester C is a good supplement to take with it. Good Luck! It works!|`|8NJM0NVvaa	take zinc it will help fight off the cold and shorten the length of it<br>  just make sure you take it with food cause on an empty stomach it could make you feel a little nauseated|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	What everyone else said lol but also throughout the day try drinking lots of fluids, I find hot water with lemon and honey is great as well! :)|`|ItFYVwlDaa	I'm not a lady, but I've found that big doses of Vitamin C help me fight off a cold.  2000 mg a day.

AA10572259	No he isn't sleeping too much.  As long as he is healthy then you are okay.  My daughter slept through the night from the time we came home.  I know they always say wake them to feed them but I totally don't agree with that.  If your baby was low birth weight or not keeping weight on then I would say you have a problem and should wake him to feed him.  Be glad that he sleeps and enjoy this time, it seems like yesterday that I was holding my little baby.  Now she is two and telling me what to do.|`|Qk4LdFCvaa	no hes fine.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	You are one lucky Mommy.  Count your lucky stars and do a happy dance...but don't hold your breath for this to last forever.  <br>  <br>  Babies change their sleep habits on the turn of a dime, so he could do this for several months, or a week or two and get back to waking up more often.<br>  <br>  Mine were like this at that age...until teething started...oh, then the sleep was done for.  Ugh.<br>  <br>  And unless he has a developmental issue and is underweight, or your doctor has specifically told you that your baby needs to be fed more often, do not wake him to feed in the middle of the night.  He'll wake up when he needs food.  And man, will he let you know when he is.|`|TO4bRflyaa	My daughter was born on Feb 12, 2009. You are lucky. My girl sleeps through the day and is awake in the nights. Next time your baby sleeps that long, wake him up at least by midnight and give him a good feeding. <br>  <br>  The sleeping is normal.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Thank your lucky stars and hope it continues. If it doesn't make sure you take full advantage of the extra sleep he is giving you!  I have a 11 week old and he is just starting to sleep 8 hours straight at night, so you are LUCKY!  Congrats and good luck.|`|oiJITSNZaa	No as long as he has his regular feedings during the day I'd say your one lucky mom! It took me 3 months to reach that stage!|`|e2NQUmusaa	Be thankful....New born's need to sleep Don't worry|`|ydy6W0sXaa	WOW, you're blessed!<br>  <br>  My son is 2 months old now.  He sleeps for 3 to 4 hours at a time and wakes up for breast feeding and when he wants his diaper changed.  So I still wake up at 1AM and at 4AM to change diapers, and my wife wakes up to breast feed him.<br>  <br>  When my son was 3 weeks old, he was a very fussy, light sleeper.  He'd wake up every hour or two, because he wasn't able to breast feed so skillfully and because he was a light sleeper.<br>  <br>  It's not unusual for a newborn baby to sleep for the majority of the day.  How long is your son up throughout the day total?  How long does your son sleep throughout the day total?  I think those two questions are more important...<br>  <br>  I'd worry if your son wasn't sleeping more than 12 hours a day.  Newborn babies are supposed to sleep a lot.  Basically, they're supposed to sleep, eat, pee, and poop.  That's their life.  And if you think about it, sleeping is going to be longer than eating, peeing, and pooping.|`|Hf5doDxsaa	I think he's okay sleeping eight or nine hours, but anymore than that I'd wake him.  It's extra important for new babies to get their vitamins.  Oh, and if he hasn't come back to him birth weight yet, I don't think I'd let him sleep that long.|`|wmc7uHLIaa	Not at all.  Believe me, you want him to sleep through the night like that.  This is a good thing!  He has figured out night and day all on his own.  What a good baby   :)|`|XrKviWgSaa	you should probably wake him up at least once in the middle of the night for a feeding|`|6lm66aHtaa	LUCKY! That is all I have to say. And I am so jealous right now....|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	no they can never sleep enough when they re new borns.lol.he's on the right path they need sleep|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	ur lucky ...my son was up every 1 to 3hours|`|AA10814887	Of course not. Its natural for newborns to sleep soo much, plus, its kind of a good thing
vygYFdsSaa	Hmm I didn't feel that but everyone is different :)|`|p4R1c6fraa	I'm not sure if I know what you mean but I can tell you what I was feeling in the beginning.I'm just about 17 weeks now.The feeling I had kind of felt like period pains but more stabby.It is your uterus doing it's job.I found out that you will feel these little pains through out the pregnancy.They are growing pains but they are normal.If they do become associated with any bleeding then call your doctor.I hope this helps you.God bless your baby and you.|`|NQRq11i4aa	This is a hard one to answer.  In the belly or ON the belly?  I've never experienced IN the belly prickling.  ON the belly (the skin) probably has something to do with either the way you or the baby are positioned.  Seeing as how you are only 6 1/2 weeks., I would say it's YOUR position..lol.  Sounds like you are either pinching or irritating a nerve somewhere.  Kind of like when your foot falls asleep prickling.|`|KtmbnW4Naa	its called being stressed are nervous
HoonZJMgaa	Its not stupid, all this new baby technology just gets more and more complicated. Lift up the mattress and place the dust ruffle over the part of the crib that holds the mattress up. This part may be a wooden board or metal springs. Make sure it hangs evenly but not touching the floor. Then place the mattress down and finish placing the bedding on. Its alright we all have some type of question at one point or another that is why we are here.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Take the mattress off the bed you the part the matress lays on is were the dust ruffle goes pull it down so it fits between this and the rails of the crib then lay the mattress down on top and put the fitted sheet on the matress|`|O1yv8z3uaa	hehehe don't worry you can put them depending on the style of the crib, if it is one of those that eventually will turn into a bed then in does you can not put a dust ruffle|`|hSJnaysiaa	It goes under the mattress, over the springy thing that holds the mattress up. Its just a bedskirt, just decoration really.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	That's perfectly normal.  Babies normally cluster-feed in the evenings and can get fussy and frustrated, but they're just trying to tank up for a (hopefully) long night's sleep.  Also, since your milk production is lower at night, he's getting more fatty hindmilk rather than the watery foremilk that he gets more of the rest of the day.  (So the quantity of milk is lower, but the fat content is higher.)<br>  <br>  The fussy evenings should pass in a month or two.  All my kids went through it.  I used to freak out with my first, thinking my supply was low or that she needed a bottle of pumped milk.  Once I relaxed and just let her keep switching sides as much as she needed, we did much better.  I knew what to expect with my next two, and I just planned to nurse practically non-stop for several hours in the evening while they fussed off and on.  <br>  <br>  This, too, shall pass.  :-)|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Make sure you are eating and drinking enough.  If you are working out in the evening, you may have lactic acid in your breastmilk that he doesn't like.|`|F7i4heAcaa	Well if you pump during the day, then your body assumes you need more milk during the day. You could see what happens if you pump at night.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	it's normal, generally speaking,moremilk is made in the moreing, and as the day goes on into evening les is made.  sucks, yes. except when i eat fish, i make more milk the next day, all day.  no clue why fish, but it works for me, lol. maybe fish oil pills would help if taken in the morning for you?  i know in france when mygrandmother had children, they would have nursing mothers drink a beer in the evening to help themlet their milk down.  i think it's the hopps. i don't know though, i happen to hate even the smell of beer.  you could always ask you dr though|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Early evening is hard, you've been feeding all day frequently, and it gets to be along day, and he is tired too.   I'd drop the pumping altogether since he thinks right now that's how it should be; milk, a lot all at once, instead of reality - milk, after some effort, slowly.   Plus you are inviting trouble with switching your nipple with a bottle, it leads to nipple confusion.   With my kids they were pretty frustrated in the the evening before bedtime, but I was tired too - it's normal and you'll see it when they are older too.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	Milk production tends to be high in the mornings because we are well-rested.  Sleep is actually one of the biggest factors that aids in milk production, water being the other.  Make you sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day (it's easy to forget), and maybe even get in some sort of nap in the afternoon.  Not easy, I know, but I bet it would help!

Don't get me wrong it's not a bad thing to skateboard, but that doesn't mean you have to dress in the skinny jeans with the long hair and smoke pot just like most other steriotypical skaters.|`|jSjb5DUeaa	no its not a bad thing. people change, its part of growing up.|`|udVdQSchaa	Change isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I smoked a lot of weed when I was your age, I'm an adult now - Looking back, it does change you in many ways especially if you start smoking more.  It's not really a great addition to your personality.  Believe it or not it's not necessarily the skating or the non-gaming that has changed you.  Your friends see you different because you do begin to act differently when you smoke weed even though you are not fully aware of it.  I think you should pay real close attention to who you think your new group of friends are.  These new "friends" may not really pull through for you in the long run and are only there to chill, skate and smoke which will not be real lasting friendships when you get older.  You will realize when you get older than even though your drifted from your older buddies you will be able to relate to them again.
Xla2eJveaa	I've been sexually active since I was 14 and that includes a lot of dry humping with him "finishing" .. Never in my 10 years of dry humping (okay i think i stopped at like 16) i never got pregnant.

vWb8fquvaa	Yes but usually if it is discovered by u/s first and a D&C follows. Eventually it will attempt to expell from the body which is when the bleeding starts but when that happens varies for each case|`|aohKqXraaa	yes, sometimes a miscarriage can happen and you have no bleeding at all, you may not even have known you were pregnant.  This happens when the fetus is just absorbed back into your body.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Yes. Its called a missed miscarriage. Its when the baby dies, but your body does not expell it.<br>  It is usually detected when an ultrasound or doppler is done and no heart beat is found|`|vygYFdsSaa	Medical training and you answered no?? Sounds a bit suspect...<br>  <br>  Yes some miscarriages occur without bleeding.|`|bo4MguzVaa	it can die, then if your body doen't pass it the doctor will have to remove it.  It's a miscarriage either way.|`|AA11874958	No you would bleed.

(Not that you aren't nice! I think you're a very nice person!) People are more likely to choose a contact/someone they recognize over someone they don't know for best answer. Keeping the same name and picture helps as well, because people will recognize you, compared to someone who changes their name all the time/changes pictures or just uses an avatar.

There is times the best answer gave inaccurate advice. I just shrug it off. <br>  <br>  I got my badge for awhile, but since I was offline for a few days, I easily lost it. You have to constantly be at it on answering and all that to keep it. <br>  <br>  I just answer the best I can, give detail results based on opinion and facts with the factual resources to go to. <br>  <br>  I also try to put a little bit more into my answer than what they asked. It helps them in case they think of a question later, they already have the answer instead of wasting more points to re ask another question they thought of. <br>  <br>  Best to try to limit your opinion and base your answer on factual.  I give a lot of my opinion on a subject I am or have been involved in. But I try to keep it professional, civil and respectable.<br>  <br>  Who wants to be bashed? Unless they are trolls or horribly (ignorantly) giving out information (aka: other answers), I just either say they are misguided/misinformed or I ignore it and hope the Questioner or other posters see that person's error.<br>  <br>  I don't think it is cheating, but sometimes I vote for myself on voting.  Especially if no one votes and leaves it just a tie, I think someone has to get the points at some time. If no one else wants to go for it, then shoot, easy 10 points. <br>  <br>  Now if someone else wants to compete (aka: get the percentage of vote), then all is equal to compete. So no one is "unfair" in the situation.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I am not an top contributor in the Adolescent section, but Ill answer anyway =]<br>  <br>  To be one, you must:<br>  <br>  -keep active<br>  -answer a lot of questions<br>  -get a lot of best answers<br>  -have a high best answer percentage<br>  <br>  What some people do to get best answers, is that you can vote for yourself!

ajMpijRJaa	i don't think so. you will know when your plug is out. lol. just trust me on that. wait until your doctors tomorrow. but if you start having pain tonight go to the er. you know what to do. <br>  Hope everything goes well! have a healthy baby. <br>  xoxo,Alley|`|7idD8uT6aa	Sounds like it!  Doesn't mean you'll go into labor tonight, but you're getting closer!  Hang in there!  There's a good chance that that your internal tomorrow (internal ultrasound, right?  Why at such a late date?  Isn't that normally something done VERY early on to check viability?) your cervix will be tweaked enough to get something started.  Good luck!|`|3cEIl1L0aa	sounds like it, but if your dr's office calls to reschedule tell them whats going on  and they should have someone in the office see you even if your dr can't. Hope everything goes great on delivery|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sure sounds like it.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Maybe. However, from what i've heard the mucus plug will have a pink tinge to it.|`|AA10572259	It could be your plug but I'm not sure since I didn't loose mine.  There is a simple test they can do at your doctors office to tell if you are just having discharge or if you are leaking fluid.  If you are leaking fluid at a very slow rate then you most likely don't have a problem since the fluid will replace itself.  If you are leaking steady though you may be loosing too much.  It is a very easy test though, and then you will know for sure.  Make sure you let them know when you go in tomorrow.  Try to relax and enjoy the little bit of quiet time you have before the baby is born.|`|ZDnPe5eIaa	Could be but unless your doctor told you otherwise its usually best to stay home while you go through the first couple hours of labor..if your in labor. unless of course this is your 2nd or more delivery in that case you could deliver very quickly. Most ob-gyn can be reached at any hour try calling your doctors office.|`|5hz1DlqWaa	dont worry<br>  its just heavy discharge.<br>  and if its something other then that.<br>  tell the doctor. (=<br>  HAVE A CUTE BABY!<br>  haha|`|uGqYoZNEaa	sounds like it's your mucus plug. good luck!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	you can try getting a smaller pillow. boppy makes them.  he might like it then, it kinda sounds like he just needs practice.  it goes under their chest a little more, helps themhold up their front end, lol.  mine loved it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	He may be a little "behind" in his development since he was a month early. I wouldn't worry too much. My son didn't master sitting by himself until around 6 and a half months, even then he'd have the occasional tumble.<br>  <br>  Also, some babies don't roll over until they are older. If he can roll from tummy to back then I'd say he's doing fine. Obviously if you're concerned speak with his doctor about it but I wouldn't be stressing.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	It has something to do with the fact that he is a baby,<br>  I wouldn't try injecting him with steroids just yet.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	It can have alot to do with him being a preemie, developmentally he should be at 6 months.  All babies are different, 7 months is still young and not all babies can sit up at that age.  My friends son is 8 months an barely started sitting up.  My son started sitting up at 6 months but didn't walk until 16 months.  My daughter is almost 4 months and cant lift her head when she is on her tummy, however she can do every other milestone for her age...  maybe its cuz she has a huge head!  Lol, im sure he is fine, if your really concerned just ask the doc.  But most preemies are behind when it comes to milestones, but technically they are right where they need to be if they would have went full term.  :)|`|oiJITSNZaa	I would probably to less jumparoo time and more time on the floor so he can stimulate his own activity.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	Maybe put him on tummy time a little longer, and stimulate his sitting by putting a pillow behind him, then taking it away and seeing how long he'd last.|`|yDp2hNc5aa	My son was like that and he never liked tummy time either. I was kind of worried too (think maybe more anxious because I couldn't wait) and around 8 months he finally started sitting up and crawling.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, it will happen|`|MMUGLjsPaa	Dear Desiree H,<br>  <br>  Every child is different and will behave differently.  "The 6th month", we were told,  was the "golden" month.  Basically, you could sit the kid down and he/she wouldn't go anywhere.  Well ... we never had a golden month.  Our kids learned to sit alright, but like your 7 month old they were only in that position for a second before they were off exploring the world ... rolling as they went.  They are all adults now with families of their own.<br>  <br>  As always, talk to your pediatrician about any concern you may have about your baby but from your description, he sounds pretty normal to me.|`|DSo3cUjeaa	I agree he should be sitting up by now. But I wouldn't compare to your other kids. I know that provides good bench mark but all kids are different. It's also your third child so I am sure you haven't had the time to work with him like your first two. I would discuss it with your doctor just for peace of mind.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	some babies are quicker learners some are slow no need to worry|`|IXJ1FzJMaa	no, my son was 6 weeks early and he is now 15 months old and he's almost walking. let him crawl around more. even if he cries let him. he will learn you just have to give him time. be patient.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	prematurity has nothing to do with it.... some babies are slow... give him one more month.|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	yes you should dffinately ask the doc about this,but then again my sis was premature both of them were and sat up fne,its all bout when they get ready in there on time.
xq7S9H5Raa	you might have a UTI.  Ask your doctor to do a Urinalysis and Urine culture on you.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	You may have a bladder infection.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Yes!  I have bladder problems and have had many catheters.  If it continues call them because having a catheter can cause you to get a bladder infection.|`|XrKviWgSaa	it happened to me when i had one done around 28/30 weeks, its normal it should have stopped by now.|`|T9fek24eaa	As long as blood is not coming from your vagina, you are safe. Catheters are pretty harsh and can cause small contusions in your bladder, especially since she had a hard time getting it in. <br>  <br>  As far as the pain, it is absolutely normal for it hurt. It hurt so bad when I went in to have my daughter, they tried to cath me the night before they induced me because I was so swollen and I couldnt stand it, I MADE them take it out with in an hour of them putting it in. It felt like I had to pee really bad, but of course I had no control over that. The next day after I got my epidural they put it back in and thankfully I couldnt feel it until after I had her and the epidural wore off, then it went back to hurting. <br>  <br>  Try to drink plenty of water, I know you are thinking "WTF! It hurts to pee" but it the acidity of the pee, not just the volume. So the more water you drink the more diluted the urine will be and it will hurt less. .

ojHVod5uaa	I have been having cramps that feel like menstural cramps for about a month and a half, it is perfectly normal unless they become unbearable or you start to bleed,then you should see your dr asap.

IuzaNq2Uaa	My favorite of your girls' names is Anna Elizabeth; I think it goes best with your surname and is less trendy than Ava Elizabeth.<br>  <br>  I don't care for Isabella Elizabeth because they are actually two different versions of the same name! Not keen on the Madelyn spelling - I would have thumbed it up if it had been Madeleine.<br>  <br>  I liked all your boys' names and thumbed them all up. My favorite is probably Alexander William, but I think Roman sounds best with your surname (although Roman William is a bit of a tongue-twister) and Jacob William is very handsome. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babynames.com/namelist/9673989" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynames.com/namelist/967398...</a>|`|TCpPdqcBaa	Jacob and Ava are adorable!|`|ej51eWO7aa	i voted for madelyn & alex|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I voted on your names and loved all of them.

p4R1c6fraa	All the signs you named are pregnancy signs.Your first test gave you  a faint line,remember,there are no false positives only false negatives,Your pregnancy hormone or HCG may still be building explaining the one false negative.I'm sure if you take another HPT in a few days you'll see that pretty pink line again.Good luck and God bless.|`|rHufcHwHaa	take another test.  you're showing signs of pregnancy, and you rarely get false positive HPTs, false negatives are more common.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If you got a positive pregnancy test, no matter how faint, you most likely are/were pregnant. False positives are really, really rare. Did you take the second test really close to the first? If so, it may have been too early for you to get a really definite positive result. I'd suggest testing again now and if it comes up negative heading to the drs. to get a blood test done. Some women do have trouble getting positive hpts.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	Those are definitley early pregnancy symptoms, and the fact that you got a positive test result, no matter how faint the line is, is just the icing on the cake letting you know that there is a bun in the oven.<br>  <br>  take another test. first morning urine will give you the most accurate answer. it's gonna be a positive, it will just have a darker line than the last positive. :)<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|1w41ReD7aa	Take a clearblue digital

It may blister so i would take her to the docs, she might need them to be wrapped up for a while if it is really bad, or not because it may make it worse.  I guess i dont really know but call the doctor.  You can give her motrin for the pain.  <br>  <br>  good luck!... poor little girl.|`|vNZVxlmhaa	yes you can use neosporin but it will hurt in the morning because u have multiple nerve endings in your fingers... AKA pain receptors, it might hurt for a while but unless it is a serious burn then see a doctor|`|in7qi4oZaa	Call the doctor and see can you use the cream. Some creams can make bacteria grow. You do not want your daughter to get a infection.
rheXAiR2aa	Call your doctor and see what they say...Alot of other factors that we don't know about that your doctor has the info on are at play here.  Such as is this your first time delivering or have you given birth before, because labor tends to be shorter.  Also if you have lost your plug you may be getting ready for your water to break as well...Are you having contractions is also a consideration, but with a 2 and a half hour drive to the hospital...I repeat call your doctor immediately ...He went to medical school for this and don't worry about inconveniencing him that is what he gets paid the big bucks for.  Take care of your baby by feeling calm and knowing everything is okay. CALL...I would and I have 3 kids...I lost my plug I was in labor every time|`|rh9CRcXraa	with my daughter i lost my plug, and didn't go into labor until 2 days later.|`|SRzswqTeaa	No, because you can loose your plug days and even weeks before labor begins.  The plug will rebuild itself every 24 hours, so you may loose bits and pieces of it from here on out.  Good luck and take care!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	i would not start driving to your hospital until you start having contractions....im sorry you live so far away i don't know what i would do if i were you and i started having contractions real bad<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	My doctor said not to go to the hsopital over losing my mucus plug because it could still be days away. I'd call and let them know though so they can tell you what to look for next.|`|HM0cxcahaa	Ive been losing mine for 2 weeks and im 40 weeks tomorrow, only call the doc if its followed by your water breaking, regular contractions or red bleeding|`|113FoyMFaa	losing your plug means nothing.<br>  <br>  some lose it wayyyyy early and it can even regenerate.|`|x5aJcD9zaa	Sometimes the plug can come out a week or so before labour begins.  Mine started to come away gradually a few days before labour began for me, so it's a bit hit and miss really.<br>  <br>  I would call your doctor and ask for their advice.  It is a sign that labour is imminent, but how imminent I wouldn't be sure of.<br>  <br>  All the best to you for the birth.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I believe you should call your doctor to get advice on this one.<br>  <br>  With my daughter i actually lost my plug @ 35 weeks and had her full term/on due date. <br>  <br>  Only your doc will have the right answer for you, but if you have to travel that far and you are a first time mom, then you will more than likely be fine with that trip once the real labor starts.<br>  <br>  Don't panic this will only make it worse|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Yes it means your getting ready to go in labor or acctually ur in labor. Loosing your mucus plug means ur in labor.
zSABr7praa	My boobs have gone from 34 B to a 38DD.  It's TERRIBLE.  I always wanted bigger boobs, but I miss my cute little boobs!  My breast now look like giant road maps!  On top of that, they hurt SO bad if I don't wear a bra, I can actually feel ligaments tearing if I don't wear a bra for 10 minutes.  It's awful!  I'm buying size L cloths and I weigh 128 pounds at 20w2d..ahh!  It'll be worth it when little one comes, but yes, I hate them and regret taking my cute boobs for granted for 21 years!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Mine are pretty much huge. Like insanely huge. I can't stand them, they make me have terrible back pains and everyone comments on how huge they are. It's very embarrassing. I went from a 34D (already big for me!) to a 36H within the first trimester. I'm having a girl. And yeah, finding clothes and bras is certainly a challenge. I pretty much live in my husband's t-shirts when I am not working!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Mine got a lot bigger until 4 months or so. I have been told they are going to be getting tons larger close to the end then get even bigger when the milk comes.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	my boobs r like a half a size bigger ... find out what im having on sat.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	My boobs grew a little bit but not that much...I've heard stories of people going from like an A to DD but not me I was an A cup then just a fuller A cup then like quite large when the milk came in but my milk is settled now months later still breastfeeding and I am barely a B so they grew a bit but nothing crazy|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Yes. My boobs got much bigger during pregnancy but I loved it ...until my stomach outgrew them. Hah! I started at a small B but ended up a big C which was great. Unfortunately, once my milk went away, so did my boobs. :( Oh...and I had a girl.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Mine have grown almost a full cup size by now. I love them, I'm a petite girl so I don't have any problem accommodating them LOL :D My bf likes them too; I'm only 15 weeks so I don't know the sex yet unfortunatelyyy|`|OwrGU6l1aa	I'm 24 weeks with a little boy and my boobs went from a small 34B to a 36D and I think they're still growing!! I love the size but hate the stretch marks I've gotten on them...thank god I haven't gotten any on my tummy yet!! :P|`|JdyRdLwVaa	Well my boobs were a 36D before i got pregnant and at 19 and a half weeks now they're at a size 36DDD.And i love my mommy boobs.And I'm due july 27th and having a Girl.|`|hOkmcVeDaa	When i was pregnant with my 4 girls they didn't get bigger but when i was pregnant with my boy they got a whole cup size bigger.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	Yes they got much bigger and I had a boy girl boy and they pretty much never got as small as before again|`|35kVNi5oaa	before i got pregnant i was a small c cup and now im wearing a 42 d. Im having a girl. :]|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	I had a girl.<br>  I actually liked my pregnancy/breastfeeding boobs, but after awhile, they really did get in the way, and I couldn't fit any of my shirts. I went from an A/B to a C/D cup. I'm always in between sizes! Haha. <br>  And nursing bras are terrible. I hated them. I ended up just wearing a regular bra unless I knew I was going to have to feed her with an audience.<br>  Good luck! Being a mom is the best!|`|ejPPUm4maa	They got huge! I had a boy he will be 10 months on May 16th 09<br>  <br>  It's amazing where did the time go!  No I don't like them b/c I still think they are too big! LOL<br>  <br>  Congrats on your bundle of joy!  What did you have? :)|`|4E2BoVptaa	I'm having a girl and I mine have gotten bigger. But, I don't mind because I'm going to breast feed. So, I think that they'll go back to normal eventually. My husband loves that they're bigger.|`|xv7YlV29aa	My best friend is very skinny and she did not show at all until she was 8 months pregnant. The only way we could tell that she was pregnant because her boobs got a lot bigger. She had a boy.|`|npEv0Irwaa	hell yea my boobs got big and am only 118 now that sucks *** to have big boobs at this age. and i had a girl|`|pR0gdrxvaa	My boobs got a little bit bigger.  Im 35 weeks with a little girl.  My boobs seem the same to me. lol|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	Yep mine did huge with both my kids but more with my 1st pregnancy I had a girl|`|e0xpYnv1aa	They got huge.<br>  I was a 34C pre-pregnancy, and by the time I was 25 weeks or so they were already at a 34DDD. I wear a size small for all my shirts and whatnot, but my boobs don't fit in any of them.<br>  And I had a girl.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	In my first pregnancy my breasts grew two sizes. I'm pregnant again and I've already gone up about two sizes so I expect to go up at least one more by the time the baby comes. Everyone is different though. I had a girl the first time...We are thinking it's a boy this time.
DBKV3g4baa	Due to her position, we were not able to tell the gender at my 20 week ultrasound.  <br>  <br>  I had an elective 3D/4D ultrasound at 27 weeks because my doctor would not/could not do another scan, and we were able to clearly see my little girl.  I would highly recommend a 3D ultrasound (around 26-30 weeks) if you want to actually see your baby's features.|`|zSABr7praa	I was able to find out at 14w5d.  I reconfirmed it 20w.  My doctor says it's good to drink lots of fluids before you go in because it allows the baby to move around a lot.  He explained it like this, "If you're in a baby pool, you're not going to move much.  If you're in an olympic size pool, you're going to be swimming all over the place."  The more it moves, the more likely you are to see "the goods"!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, they had no trouble seeing the gender at my 20 week ultrasound.|`|IVNM1O5naa	I found out at 18 weeks. Doctors usually check between 18 and 24 weeks.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	With both of my pregnancies they were able to see the sex of the baby, but my boys weren't shy!  LOL... they let it all hang out.  I think it depends on how they are positioned.  With the first one, we took one look at the screen and KNEW it was a boy... with the second (which we are still waiting to see if she is right) we couldn't tell by looking but the technitian seemed pretty convinced.  A subsequent U/S showed that it was a boy as well.<br>  <br>  But like anything... there is margin for error.  A friend of mine was told they were having a boy.  Decorated the room with Lightening McQueen... and were very surprised when  a little girl popped out.  <br>  <br>  So we have erred on the side of caution with lots of  yellow and gender neutral items.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good Luck!|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Yep! I actually went in at 17 weeks and saw the "sitting on a glass table"-view of my soon-to-be baby girl...it was a VERY obvious picture! If you're unsure of what's-what, don't be scared to ask the tech (or doctor) to point everything out!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I had a scan at 19weeks and was told i was having a boy.<br>  <br>  Because of preterm labour, i had another scan at 22weeks, then 27weeks and im definately having a girl.<br>  <br>  They arent always 100%|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yep, we could see very clearly it is a boy at my 18 week scan.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i656.photobucket.com/albums/uu283/kandice0709/baby9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i656.photobucket.com/albums/uu283...</a>|`|vygYFdsSaa	Most women find out at this time!!! :) As long as baby's willing to show off the goods that is|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	With both of my children I was able to see the sex around 20 weeks|`|bo4MguzVaa	mine's a boy at 19 weeks!  yay|`|422baec93c2e09175c8e2ab1b0c51d3baa	yes. we saw immediately it was a boy :)|`|rui1fmv7aa	21 weeks and 1 day pregnant and they showed I just found out today that I am having a boy :)<br>  good luck!!|`|l0AxPrDRaa	Yup! I knew mine was a girl at 17 weeks. (why I had a scan at 17 weeks is a long story.)|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Yes, I was exactly 21 weeks and 1 day and she was very nice by cooperating and letting us see HER :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	As long as the baby is cooperating then you should. That's actually the best time to look.
vygYFdsSaa	Not sure, but I'm sure it wouldn't hurt...they sell nipple cream for mums, perhaps you could try that also.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I never heard that one. You need to discuss this with your Ob/Gyn. Maybe you need to change your bath soap for one that is non drying. Ask your doctor if changing bath soap is worth a try. If he/she agrees, try Dove soap. It makes the skin really soft & smooth. When showering, don't use real hot water, as it'll dry your skin out.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I don't know if it helps with nipple itch but it wouldn't harm you so go for it!|`|UUx74K5Caa	I'd just use *a lot* of moisturizer like coco butter or St. Ives.  I've only heard of the model's trick dabbing just a bit of hemorrhoid cream under the eyes to lessen puffiness.  Never heard of the nipple thing.  Good luck hon.<br>  <br>  Regarding the "nipple cream" I did find this link you should check out.  (The FDA warned on May 23, 2008 that using Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream may harm nursing babies.)  Man if it's not one thing it's another.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_2262.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_2262.html</a>|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Hemorrhoid creams aren't really moisturizing, so I wouldn't bother doing that...get a good eczema cream like Spectro Jel or an anti-itch cream like Aveeno...not hemorrhoid cream.|`|u4FGBKi4aa	Use a different emollient...|`|6PEOqeLOaa	you could try it. I read in a pregnancy magazine to prevent dry nipples/chest to not lather soap on them while you are in the shower. i would def wash under your breast(think of the sweat that collects under them) and above but i think your nipples will be fine they really don't get sweaty and the soap can dry them out. i would used a first aid ointment such as A+D or Vaseline or a heavy cream this should help then just switch to a regular moisturizer (try something like clean and clear they sell stuff that wont clog your pores so you don't break out from the cream)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|19iD220Jaa	I was told that if hemmorhoid cream was meant for anything other than your butt... it would say please use for butt, eyes and nipples..... dont use it for that is not directed to please.! I would try lotions for prego ladies and if that doesnt help the home remdi of a lil pure corn starch in your warm bath water... Please use the hemmorhoid cream for the lower part of your body. lol|`|AA10468184	It's possible you may have a yeast infection on your chest.  Talk to your doc!  I would not use any medication without talking to your OB GYN...You need to see what is going on...
x5aJcD9zaa	Apparently it works well if you have tired skin under your eyes too.  Rub it on and it firms the skin right up!  I can't remember which model recommended it though.
JFCfVSZSaa	ALL moms are working moms...|`|TQW5E6olaa	Lets focus on the first part of your question; "the merits of a stay at home mom." There's no proof anywhere in the world that says if you stay home your child is guranteed to be better/smarter/successful at all let alone more so than someone who's parents both worked. Look for another angle, or you'll come off looking ignorant. <br>  <br>  It's how you parent in general not whether you work in or outside the home or both.<br>  <br>  What's your major?|`|prqrQcd1aa	Maybe simply state that there no statistics that can prove being a SAHM has any affect on if a child turns out better or not...|`|a9YfUGzSaa	If you can't find a source to tell you anything like that, maybe it's not true? :P  That's not how you write a research paper!  You're supposed to do the research and THEN come up with a conclusion to write your paper about.  It automatically damages your credibility if you're only looking for sources that specifically say what you want them to, because that's biased.<br>  <br>  My mom worked at home, if that counts, and I was thankful to always have someone to call if I was having trouble at school.  I remember waiting in the nurses office in elementary school waiting to use the phone to be picked up because I was sick, and there would be kids just sobbing into the phone saying, "but mommy, my tummy hurts" and they couldn't leave work to come get them, so the kids had to go back to class.  I was always glad my mom could come get me.  I am going to University of Michigan, and eventually on to law school.  I am statistically insignificant all by myself, so you can't use me as a source, but there's an angle for you to consider.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	That's going to be hard to find because I don't think stay at home mom's are any better or worse. I'm a stay at home mom because I can be, but my mom wasn't and I never felt neglected or anything. I had amazing working parents. For me I'm happy I can stay home with my daughter but I wouldn't be any less of a mom if I didn't. I know this isn't what you were looking for but just saying. Like someone else said it'll be hard to find Information that doesn't exist.|`|u0HZkGL6aa	Stay at home Moms have dinner on the table every night.  Stay home Moms have laundry done.  Clean clothes in the dresser and closet everyday.  Stay at home Moms have more patients because their home is at work not brought home.  Stay at home Moms listen because they've been waiting all day to hear about the world their children are living in.  I'm talking about the stay at home Mom whom wants nothing more but to be the most important woman in the world.  There's nothing more important in this world than love.  I'm talking about the Mom whom loves nothing more in life than being the Mom she was meant to be...the expectations are oh so high.  Some woman want to be Lawyers.  Then decide they want a baby.  Or they want to be Doctors.  Then decide they want a baby.  A career change.  Being a Mom is a career.  All too many have forgotten that.  I wouldn't want to be a Lawyer and a Doctor.  Why do so many think they can be a Mom and a Doctor.  Or, a Lawyer and a Mom.  People wonder why the world IS...ask your Lawyer or Doctor how many children they have waiting at home for them.  Microwaving their dinner.  On the internet.  Playing their X-box or watching the idiot box.  Buying time for a quick good night kiss.  Buying time for a...just buying time?!|`|J6dqopIjaa	i dont have a survey that says it but in psychology they teach you that children have to be cared for and need a good amount of attention so that they grow up well. children who dont have their mothers around when they're young express more hostility toward others when they're older. there are other things but thats the first thing that comes to mind. i hope it's something along the lines of what you can use for you paper|`|AA12083271	In my personal experience children raised either way can turn out GREAT.  I am a stay at home mom I couldn't stand the thought of someone raising my child for me.  That and the cost of child care is crazy.   It just depends on the time and effort put in to your child.  For instance if i just let the TV raise my child she would only learn what the TV stations wanted her to learn.  However back home in TN when I worked there was a daycare that was just as good if not better than a pre-K.  She was a teach for many years and designed her daycare to also do schooling.  Children are funny you get a lot out of them but I think you have to put a lot into them to get that.  Good luck with the essay it's going to be a hard point to prove.  I would talk about the time you get to spend with the child as well as being able to turn any sittuation into a school experience even cooking cleaning rearranging furniture counting while brushing your teeth counting toys printables of letters off the internet ive already started my 3 year old on how to speak Greek.|`|YFzprqqgaa	Many people tend to jump out and say the children of stay home moms tend to be more polite, honest, etc.  Bull Butter!  Me and my wife both work and our children are very well adjusted, polite, straight "A"s, in all the AP classes, etc.  Our children are so good because me and their mom get home as fast as we can, eat dinner as a family, go to church on Sundays and Wednesdays as a family, and spend a lot of family time together on weekends.  We make sure that the reason we work is for our children and everything we do is for our children.  On top of family time, we teach our children to work.  My wife teaches them to cook, clean house, etc.  I teach them farm work. :)  and they hate it at times.  You have to prioritize.  There are times you have to take off from work and its good that you have a job that is flexable enough that you can put your kids ahead of your job on a regular basis.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	In my field of work ( social work ) this topic comes up again and again. Most studies are actually only opinion pieces. And anyone can give you that.<br>  <br>  For myself, it depends on the Mother herself and other family dynamics  and many other outside influences on how the child will turn out. <br>  <br>  There is the stay home Moms who put their kids in front of the TV all day and still do not get any housework done. There are moms who work but kids are home with Dad, or grandparents and how is that a bad thing?  My point is, there is a million factors that can happen.<br>  <br>  I work, but my kids are in school. I miss about 2 hours out of their lives a day. Sometimes I am home before them if they have after school activities. It would be silly  for me to sit home all day by myself and have my family take a huge financial hit for the sake of 2 hours. BUT if  worked 12 hours a day I can see how that would affect my family.|`|lq56atR3aa	Lots of SAHM's do it so they can homeschool their children. Maybe you can look into the benefits of homeschooling vs children taught in public schools to add some weight to your paper. <br>  Here is part of an article I found online when I googled homeschooling vs public schools: <br>  "Even the Unites States Department of Education agrees. In one study which they sponsored themselves home schooled students produced exceptionally high test scores. The median scores in every grade were far higher than those of public schools and even higher than those of private school students. The average home schooled student in grades one through four was a grade level above that of public school peers and, by the time home schooled students reached the equivalent of the 8th grade, they were as much as four years ahead of students attending public school."|`|ZDnPe5eIaa	WORKING VS.

DPSadeFjaa	It's a possibility that could already be going through pregnancy symptoms but it's hard to say because everyone is different. I started to get mine when I was 3 months pregnant. The best advice would be to go and see the doctor.|`|96HWpdkFaa	It's different for everyone. My first symptoms were sore breasts. If your worried take a test.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|p4R1c6fraa	Implantation bleeding is not bright red but more of a pinkish color.You may be off on your math with how far along you are too.Have you taken a pregnancy test yet?

277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	prunes or prune juice would prolly work best, at least they do for mine.  if you want to make the prunes yourself you take the prunes and soak them in warm water for 10-15 minutes then take them out and put in a blender/food processer and puree, you can add water, (and i would add water, not breastmilk since she's constipated the less nutrients the better in this case) to make the right consistency.  my son actually likes the prunes, lol.  he goes nuts over them.  i know you can get stool softeners too.  oh you can take the extra prune puree and freeze in ice cube trays, they don't freeze solid, but they freeze enough to pop out and put in ziplocks for a later use.<br>  <br>  edit: also,i started my son on rice cereal when he was four and a half months, he wasn't satisfied at all by just milk any more and did get constipated a couple of times, he still does and the prunes have always helped.  he is now working on 8 months on the 20th , lol wow the time flies.|`|AA10270143	Stop giving her rice cereal for starters. secondly you can try going to the fallowing website to look up some more advanced advice.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com</a>|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Give her 4 ounces of half water and half apple, pear, or prune juice.  Then gently massage her lower left abdomen (below belly button) in small clockwise circles.  If there is a blockage, the massage will help it to release.|`|GU3RauKOaa	My daughter got constipated when she started solids too. After 3 days I had had enough and put her in a warm bath to soak. She strained and cried for about 10 minutes before it started to come out and I basically had to help pull it out as it was dry like cat poop. Then, of course, she had another bath, lol. But a warm bath really helps them relax and pass it. You can massage their lower belly to try to help them. Also try baby food prunes or prune juice. Not too much because they really really work within a couple hours. Although those foods are generally recommended to start at six months, if you are one of the many moms that doesn't wait that long then that can be the most helpful thing to get it out. If that doesn't work then talk to your doctor. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: when you are starting solids, look out for foods like applesauce and carrots as they cause constipation as well.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	All the above advice about fruit and fruit juice is correct.  But since this is a long-standing problem (3-5 days), autointoxication from the bowels has become an issue.  So - give her a baby-size glycerine suppository.  No side-effects, suitable for long term use, almost guaranteed to make her do a dooey in 5-15 minutes.|`|AA10500703	Remember what you eat goes to her. Make sure you are eating a healthy diet, and drinking lots of water. When I was breastfeeding I remember my doctor saying that that was normal sometimes, because the baby is absorbing all of the nutrition because she is having a growth spurt. So I would not worry too much yet.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	I don't think I would have given her the rice cereal.  We give rice to our dog when she has diarrhea.

As if you hadn't thought of that!<br>  <br>  Here's what to do:  give the baby  some diluted pear juice (tastier and less staining and just as effective as prune juice) and have her take a few warm baths each day until she has a bm.  Don't give her rice cereal until after she has a bm.  Consider adding pear juice to her diet--or pureed pears--as a regular item.  You can even water down the rice cereal with it, when not using breast milk or formula.<br>  <br>  The baths will help a lot too.  Trust me.|`|27fd034847d3d27fde933f822451de7baa	try putting some corn syrup in a nipple of a bottle and let her suck on that. the sweet can help. you can hold her high on your shoulder and rub the small of her back to ease any discomfort. also use a warm wash rag on her lower back.. it Will soothe her a little. if this doesn't help by tomorrow id call the doc. they can give you some infant medicine to help her along.|`|AA11427075	To relieve constipation you can give anything that starts with P... prunes, pears, peas are the best.  At 5 months old I'd try pear juice first.  You can dilute it with some water.  After giving my son prunes he typically has a softer than normal bowel movement within an hour!|`|M0Cg6Kyhaa	call your pharmacist or your doctor.  Why does she get cereal already?  That seems odd.  My child didn't have that for the 1st year - I guess all are different though.  <br>  Good luck, I hope it works it's way out soon.<br>  :)|`|AA12022635	Shouldn't you ask a doctor that question rather than a bunch of bored, random people surfing Yahoo answers?|`|4wH3Hvcxaa	Take her to the doctor instead of sitting on Yahoo Answers !i She needs medical attention.|`|AA11134717	give her apple juice or prune juice that should help|`|ydy6W0sXaa	My son just turned two months and he was constipated for two days just recently.  (This is unusual, because my son poops at least 3 times a day.)  My son is being breast fed.  And I give my answer(s) as a first time father.<br>  <br>  1.  First, if you're really that worried that your child is constipated, call your pediatrician and discuss your problem/worries.<br>  <br>  2.  Second, your child is only 5 months old, but you're already giving her rice cereal?  My pediatrician told me to take it easy and start around 6 months.  Perhaps the cereal is making her "dry."  Constipation usually results when an individual is not getting enough liquids.  Maybe the cereal is making your child "dry."<br>  <br>  3.  You can help your child poop.  Try "stimulating" her anus with a rectal thermometer or a baby wipe.  I read about this online and colleagues at work recommended this.  And you can also massage your baby's tummy underneath the navel.<br>  <br>  4.  Find what relaxes your baby and make it comfortable for your baby to relax.  My son likes to poop while he's breast feeding.  When he's breast feeding, my wife and I make sure that he's comfortable and given sufficient time to eat, rest, and sit, so that he can poop comfortably.|`|SlkLCLoDaa	Best thing ever, give her just like a teaspoon full of Dark Karo corn syrup, my mom is a nurse and taught me this trick for when my kids were constipated. It works everytime, just mix it in with her rice cereal. If this doesn't work(which it did for me 99.9% of the time) I would take her to the pediatrician just to make sure everything is ok. Also you can try and push her little legs up to her tummy, sometimes this will help move things along so to speak:) Hope this helps and good luck!|`|7aJxUSU5aa	Everything is okay....Sometimes this happens and it is completely normal. What I do when my son is constipated is:<br>  <br>  When I am changing his diaper I push his knees gently to his chest (It is what the doctor told me to do) and I hold them there for a few seconds and then stretch them out and do it again and so on for about 5 minutes. It opens the way so all that stuff can come out and helps them push it out.<br>  <br>  You could also try rubbing her stomach or giving her a warm bath....sometimes that helps.<br>  <br>  For all of your baby questions I would go to babycenter.com and join the August 08 group. They are great ppl and they will definately help.|`|43nvTi3Naa	i use a tea called manzanilla (aka chamamoille) give it to her sorta of warm ..it will put her to sleep because it is calming but it will also help her bowel movements also try prune juice good luck! i hope the little gets better!|`|j1sR2eU7aa	give her a small amount of prune juice ex: 1oz oz juice to 2oz of water. she'll like it and it will help her poop. just be prepared to do alot of diaper changes. i had that problem with my daughter too|`|CiwJWNodaa	take her to the doctor!<br>  like right now!|`|N6Kgltq2aa	take her to the doctor.. poor baby :(|`|rwZVtoYaaa	prune juice<br>  milk of magnesia<br>  or better yet, take her to the doctor!|`|PYOn4jL2aa	prunes and soy milk|`|Vwudk3y6aa	get stool softener! only give her one
8yE2sYGeaa	No positive answers here, sorry to say.<br>  <br>  He is guilty of statutory rape.<br>  <br>  Even if you consented to have the sex, you were not of an age where you could legally consent (18) and depending on where you live, if he is more than two years older than you (even if it is by a day) then it is considered full rape<br>  <br>  Now, even if you turn out not to be pregnant, your parents can STILL prosecute for the statutory rape. Oh, and also be advised that your life as you knew it is going to be turned completely upside down and you will be scrutizined for the next 3-plus years|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. You both are under the age of consent. Neither of you are of legal age so he can't be arrested.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Only if she presses charges and whether the case is serious enough to warrent the arrest. But why would she want to do that?! Wow.|`|sp89XfT4aa	You are both minors. I don't see why he would be arrested, but I guess it depends on your state's law.|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	Well the legal of consent is 18 in most places so no he cannot be arrested unless your mother decides to turn him in on rape charges. You can testify and say he did not if you love him, fight for him it is only right.|`|rHufcHwHaa	No, you're both under 18.  He won't get arrested for getting you pregnant.|`|E5HAzKYHaa	Dont believe so....he is not an adult yet!  Only if it was by rape which i am guessing its not. Good luck!|`|lJbLxz39aa	14? Oh Geez, there's nothing positive to say. You're both screwed.|`|PeOCqztoaa	I don't think they can arrest him. He is not considered an adult. I know in some states the age of consent is 16. Most likely your mom is trying to scare you because she's upset that you might be pregnant. Try talking to her like an adult about the situation and she might calm down. I'm sure it's pretty hard for her to hear her baby might be pregnant. Good luck! : )|`|F32uPjAraa	I'm sorry to say this luv, but yes. You are below the age of consent, 16, and he is above the age of consent. This is called statutory rape, even though I assume you consented, it is still illegal, and he may be arrested, and charged. That is in Australia.|`|ETZbKDOqaa	No, he can not be arrested. It is within a reasonable age. It is half your responsibility, remember that. Try talking with your mom, ask her to stop being such a idiot. Thanks so much.|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	I really don't think so, he is under the age limit, even though you are young. I am sure though that your mom can find a way to keep him away from you though.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	I don't think so. Only if he's 18 or older. But no matter his age, he is still liable for child support... even if it's his parents who have to pay it until he can get a job.|`|CAQAmZbjaa	I think it's only illegal if he were over 18 years old.<br>  I'm not completely sure though, seeing as I'm not a lawyer;D<br>  Lol.<br>  <br>  I hope your not pregnant and I hope he doesn't get arrested!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	depends on which state you live in ... that is a state law ... you might be able to google it|`|BRrSdg3Gaa	he will have to pay child support. if he doesnt then yes|`|vygYFdsSaa	You are under the legal age of consent (technically its "illegal" to have sex under the age of 16 in many states) so its possible. I believe in Florida at least that there can be a 2 year age difference between partners but anything more than that is statutory rape.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetheart. Try talking to your mom, maybe if she spends time with your boyfriend she'll be less inclined to get him in trouble|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Depends on the state you live in...<br>  There's two laws to be aware of, Statutory Rape (anyone under the age of 18, even if it's one day, having sexual relations with anyone 18 or over, atleast in CA)...and the Romeo and Juliet Law, in some cases it can over-turn Statutory Rape (esp with a good lawyer!), I'm not sure of the exact number, but it has something to do with being 4 or 5 years apart and being able to still legally have sex.|`|NQRq11i4aa	It all depends on the laws of your state.  Majority of them though...he won't be arrested unless you claim rape.  As long as everything was consensual there's not a lot mom can do other than refuse to let you see him, restraining order, etc.  Fully expect though for mom to demand a dna test when the baby is born and for your boyfriend to be dragged to court for child support.  Hopefully you can all communicate to each other well and do what's best for the baby in the long run.  Ultimately he/she is who will be affected the most.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	Laws very from state to state I'm sorry hun but normally the legal age isn't until 16 :( the good news how ever is that your boyfriend should be in the clear your parents are really the only one's that could press charges aside from you of course. What exactly did the lawyer tell your mom? He should have been able to provide some information. Check your state laws they could be different but most places is 16.|`|fhoFrk9Yaa	Honestly, it depends on the state. And whether or not you want to press charges, though it seems your mother wants to press charges no matter what.<br>  In most (if not all) states, yes. He could get arrested. But before your mother presses charges if she does, you should ask him if he will be there for the child, and if so, make him stick to it. Then tell your mother you wouldn't want your baby to know that his father went to prison and couldn't be with him/her because of his grandmother. It's a bit of a guilt trip, but she shouldn't press charges unless absolutely necessary (like if he abandons you and the baby).|`|QHBuH39jaa	I don't think he can be arrested but he will be held responsible.  Good luck to you, your life is about to get extremely hard.  I wish you would have thought about being sexually active long and hard.  You should have listened to your parents and stayed a kid as long as possible because trust me, your are going to hate being an adult.|`|9jiHVKpOaa	ot depends on the situation.. in all honesty i dont think your mom has the right to do that.. what you and your boyfriend do is your choice and she would really put him in jail for sex that seems weird but my dad is a lawyer and i dont think its possible unless he was older but he is not which is good|`|Yi0hym4Yaa	Nope, not unless he raped you, only if he was 18 because he would be legally an adult, you're lucky this time, don't screw up the kid, give it to adoption, you're too young for sex,you can't handle a kid hun..what the heck were you thinking?|`|akvrwpywaa	Probably.  Depends on the state law of what the consensual age for sex is.  Depending on what the state law is, he (and maybe even you too) might have to register as sex offenders for life.<br>  (You're way too young to be doing it!)|`|D0wM1Qpeaa	thats retarded!!!!! why would your boyfriend get arrested thats life!!!!!|`|jJjoZ3zfaa	uh, no >_> he cant because think of how many teenage pregnancies there are in the UK and USA, that also answers the question "what causes a population boom?"|`|kMDAjsBnaa	He can get arrested if you claim rape and prove that it was not consensual sex.  Otherwise, your just a couple o happy go lucky kids. Have Fun!|`|FxzijnSIaa	Tell your mom she did a horrible job raising you.

However, the age of 14 is under the age of consent in most states. Many states consider age 16 the age of consent, but it can vary anywhere from 14 to 18.<br>  <br>  Basically, the age of consent is the age at which a person is considered competent to give consent to having sex. Age of consent is based on the premise that below a certain age, a person is being manipulated or coerced into having sex and thus not able to give permission.|`|WniOOchkaa	I think for the most part he would have to be over 18 to be arrested. If he was over 18 they could arrest him for statutory rape due to you being a minor. They only exception is if there was some type of law regarding specific ages or age differences in your state or if he raped you.  I wish you the best and hope all goes well for you.|`|SqExrSUGaa	Hello dear :)<br>  <br>  I'm fifteen and pregnant.<br>  and my boyfriends 18.<br>  <br>  my mother made sure the law/anyone in general cant do anything, because he would be/is the legal father of the baby that could possibly be in your tummy.<br>  <br>  but if anything is to happen, and he goes to court or anything you have say in it, so yeah.<br>  <br>  nothing to bad could happen.<br>  :P|`|AA10262243	He is underage too.

erKyfwSbaa	Actually it is better to have intercourse every other day to allow his sperm to build back up again. Sperm lives for around 3 days in your body. It is best to start trying a couple days before ovulation so the egg can meet the sperm in the Fallopian tubes when it is released.   <br>  Also, Keep your man out of the hot tub and have him wear loose undergarments.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!|`|T8fZOmdOaa	There is no set amount obviously- you can get pregnant just doing it once a month.<br>  <br>  Im guessing though that the more you do it, the more your chances increase.<br>  Just be careful not to let sex develop into a chore- men get very bored of this and it can really affect the relationship after a while.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	A day?!  Wow, do you have energy.  We have three little kids.  My husband's lucky if he gets it more than once a week these days.<br>  <br>  It's recommended that you have sex either every day or every other day a few days before and after your expected ovulation time.  An ovulation kit purchased from the drug store can help you figure out when that is.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, relax and have fun with it - it certainly helps to have those natural juices flowing to get the job done!!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|B4qdaEOLaa	once is enough but if you would like you can go on but just as long as he umm.... cums then your set|`|o1yy6KABaa	The less you have sex, the stronger the sperm is.

ibWLdXlJaa	According to peeonastick.com (hpt question #44):<br>  <br>  "Every woman's metabolism is different, but as a general rule of thumb, you should allow 1 day for every 1,000 units of hCG you injected. The standard hCG dose is 10,000 units; thus, 10 days after the shot, the synthetic hCG should be gone and you should be able to test for pregnancy without detecting the shot. However, you should ask your doctor what the recommended protocol for your dosage is."<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust.|`|scdOdaTKaa	I wouldn't get your hopes up there is a strong possibility that this is a remnant of the hCg shot.  THis is something you should have asked your doctor, I would imagine that having that hormone may cause your body to display some of the symptoms of pregnancy I'm not sure, you should call your doctor and ask them since they gave you the injection.

gW3k9Eyhaa	Comfort him and cuddle him if that's what he needs, it's very normal :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	Hold him if that's all he wants. I wouldn't force him to take a feed between 5 and 10 if he doesn't want one. He may just not be hungry then.<br>  <br>  Our son was colicky(didn't believe it at the time but looking back it makes sense) until about 4 months. He cried straight through from 7 PM to 8 PM unless my husband was holding him and rocking with him or if we went for a walk. Those were the only two things that worked.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Hum, I wouldn't try to force him to feed if he's not hungry. Possibly its colic, which is usually worse in the evenings. Or just tired crankiness after a long day of learning new things. Either way, holding him seems to work so that's what I'd do. Maybe you could try a baby sling, so you can still do stuff around the house ?<br>  <br>  Maybe it's also time to introduce a bedtime routine. Around 8 or 9, when he starts to look sleepy, give him a nice warm bath. Maybe a massage with baby cream  after if you're into that, then clean p-j's. Start dimming the lights, speaking softly etc. Then swaddle him up good and one last feed,cuddle and nightie-night !<br>  <br>   I think that 2 months was about the age my daughter was when we started (she was also quite fussy during evenings) and she soon started skipping a night feeding and now she sleeps 10 hours ! At this age, babies have more fatty reserves, and can go longer between feedings, so if he sleeps (or plays), then let  him. He will let you know when he's hungry !
AA10529334	Yes its normal behavior for this age. The only thing you can do is to continue with your work and talk to her while you do it. It does help to not let this stop you from doing what is necessary. It will shorten the amount of time she does it. Just keep smiling and go into the other room if she crys,  just give a hug and go on with your work. She isnt gonna die from having a melt down when you leave the room. And yes, it may take a while of her crying every few minutes but soon she will stop doing it - once she sees you always come back quickly to her. <br>  <br>  It also helps to let her be in the same room with you. If you are in kitchen (where it can be dangerous) she can sit in her high chair and play or munch.  I found the use of a pack n play invaluable at this age. I could put baby in there while i used the bathroom, emptied washer, or whatever - since the child is gonna cry anyway at least they are safe.|`|eIjiI0M8aa	Gosh. You explained my day perfectly. I am a stay at home mom as well and it's so hard for me to get anything done...at all! I only get things done when she is taking a nap which here lately isn't very much. I read that it's best to give them that attention they want at this age. Not fun but we have to I guess. I have a sling which I carried her in when she was a newborn but it also can be used to hold a baby on your hip. When I HAVE to use it, I do. Good luck. It's definitely hard!|`|gW3k9Eyhaa	I just went through this =D It gets better trust me. I just cuddled him and made sure he could see me when I was doing chores around the house. It's over before you know it. Good luck :D|`|YP1DXbBDaa	It's normal and it does get better as you go.  If you're having trouble getting things done, invest in a great baby carrier-I like the Ergo, some moms prefer Maya Wraps or Moby Wraps and wear your baby on your back or on your hip while you're working.  I pop my ten and a half month old in a carrier when I'm cleaning and she gets to hang out with me which makes her happy and I still get things done.  I save things that are dangerous for her, like cutting vegetables for when she's napping.

CdJtH0xdaa	I have nothing against you having a girlfriend at that age.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Yes, it is weird, mostly because it is uncommon. There is nothing "wrong" with it though.<br>  <br>  Most people will be surprised, but probably won't say anything.|`|5tqh0akYaa	Nope it doesn't bother me i have bi friend who is a girl and a gay guy friend. It all depends on who you tell, just tell them to keep an open mind. :) best of luck|`|iTi26ojQaa	i don't think that is weird at all<br>  But most people will say that you can't know if you are gay that young. My dad doesn't believe that people can be gay even at age 15 or 16. So if you tell people, realize that many people don't accept people to be gay or bisexual. they think its unnatural, and that its probably just a phase.|`|HOdblqIkaa	i dont think its weird but others might. not every one is so accepting to a different lifestyle so if you go out and tell them you have a girlfriend they might not care, or they might say something incredibly rude and hurtful.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	Some people may take it bad, because some people are homophobic. I do not think it's weird. I have tons of friends who have same sex relationships|`|p3d3E75oaa	ok so its what you wanna do, but you are still young|`|Wtyk7086aa	Well, there are a few chick on chick things at my school (sorry if that was offense in anyway), but you know I don't care. It's something that if you want to do it, you can do it. It's becoming more acceptable in America today, and people are learning to deal with it. They can do whatever they want. People might give you a hard time about it, but thats only because basically they are jealous you had enough courage to try something that is frowned upon especially at your age, and that you can stand up for what you believe on. I do not personally think it's weird at all (and no I'm not a lesbian), you can do what you want :) it's what America is about, and if you want to tell people then hell, go and tell people, but if you want it quiet then keep quiet (; no biggie<br>  -no regrets|`|ud0gPY3baa	Okay I will be honest<br>  I think that you having a girlfriend is perfectly fine <br>  However you ARE a bit young to have a girlfriend considering that you also are a girl.

Maybe its better if you keep it secret, and since your 13 you should wait....<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! ( :|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Well some people know that they are guy from a very young age and other people just experiment.

It depends where you live, I think people are different about the issue in different areas. My class wasn't the class with these people in there but everyone seemed okay with them in our town whereas in other towns they might be outlawed for what they are. It's all people's beliefs and religion. I think you are okay and not wrong.|`|6HGeGFzCaa	I'm 13 too (and a girl) and I don't think it's weird. :)<br>  <br>  I have no issues about things like that. I believe a person has a choice and can do whatever they want with their lives. As long as you're happy go for it (that's my motto btw).<br>  <br>  But be careful who you tell because there are some nutcases who will hold that against you. If you do decide to tell anyone only tell your best friends who you trust to accept you. If your friends don't accept, then they're not your friends. It's called prejudice. I don't have it for anyone, and friends shouldn't have it for friends.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	It's not weird to be a lesbian. It's what your taste is. You can't control it, so don't worry.<br>  But, if your straight OR gay, it doesn't matter. Having any kind of relationship now is kind of early. You might want to wait. You might even find out when yourr older , that your really not a lesbian. Your hormones are just messing up with you.<br>  But, over all, you should wait a bit. But the thought of a lesbian ISNT BAD! :)<br>  I hope I helped!|`|Wa0pHJwMaa	It's a different time now. People are more open to homosexual relationships, but many are not. Since you are 13, I would recommend learning more about yourself and your sexuality before you announce things one way or another.

You are probably just going through a stage where you like girls.

NkjAqQWBaa	I think its great you went and got that done! For a couple reasons, becuse you wont have time to get it done, and because it is supposed to help trigger contractions. You know thats a good thing at this point. :) Oh, and some lady said her doc said that she could lift whatever she wanted to right now, even lift heavy objects. Thats not true!! You can still rupture your placenta. My guess is if you are worried about getting a mani or pedi, you wont think you can lift anyting heavy. lol Good luck. Tues is a full moon....maybe your baby will come then!!|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	You will be fine. If it sends you into labor, it would be a good thing. I wouldn't worry. My doctor told me I could go out and do anything I wanted, lift as much weight as I could, and whatever else I could think of after 37 weeks because the baby is able to live on their own.<br>  Don't worry, and good luck in labor!|`|YOZBquCGaa	ur fine. the most crucial time in pregnancy is 1-3 months because ur baby's internal organs are still developing.
seU9VwIJaa	When I had my ultrasound, they thought that something could be wrong with my little guy's kidneys. I wouldn't panic until you see the specialist. I was terrified when I went to get a level 2 ultrasound done, and it turns out that nothing was wrong. They just want someone who is more skilled at looking at abnormalities and has better equipment to take a look. Worse case scenario is that the baby may need surgery, but like I said...it's usually just a precaution!<br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	don't be sorry because i would be worried too.<br>  <br>  first of all, your doctor should have told you everything. i think it's wrong when people come here to get answers because they have questions from their last doctor appt.<br>  <br>  you need to call your doctor tomorrow and either talk to your doc or the nurse and ask THEM your questions. because NO ONE on here will be able to answer them correctly for you UNLESS someone has been through the same thing and they will only be able to answer a little bit.|`|AA10458750	For legal reasons mainly, anytime they see an abnormaility they will recommend you to a specialist. It could honestly be nothing, but they need to have it double checked in case it is something that will require immediate attention after birth. Don't worry until you've had further ultrasounds done!  Whether or not you're religous, the best thing you can do is pray for your baby & gf's health. Good Luck!

mYpsfptTaa	wow whats really crazy about this is one of my best friends wen tru the same thing yesterday we went thru 3 pos at home tests, 1 neg test at a clinic and then finally a positive at a hospital.. im not gonna talk your head off about our long day but from that day i have a learned a couple of things.. the best time to take the test is as soon as you wake up or what some ppl call your "morning pee" apparently its the best to go off off. i also learned that there is never a false positive (unless you just recently gave birth, had a miscarraige or an abortion) but you can have a false negative.. so if you proceed to take a morning test tomorrow (id recomment 2 sep brands.. first response and clear blue early response or whatever) and if they STILL come our negative and you're still feeling weird.. go to a hosp and u can pee in a cup for them and ifnd out the truth :) hope this helps!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You would be almost 2 months pregnant so you would have a positive test by now. <br>  <br>  Get a PAP smear. There may be something else wrong.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	If you don't have regular insurance, or a public aid type insurance where you can go to a regular doctor, try going to a clinic where they will do a blood test for pregnancy instead of a urine test. These are usually much more accurate, and can tell you almost immediately after conception. When I was only about as far along as you may be, I had a few cramps, some that actually felt like my period was starting, but they may have only been the implantation cramping/bleeding, and everything getting ready for a baby. My back didn't start hurting until much, much later in my pregnancy, and I didn't start getting really hungry and having weird cravings until much later either. Everyone is different, of course, so I would definitely try another doctor! Good luck!|`|hMF3kg3Baa	It is just March you would not be showing symptoms that fast like hunger. You are probably not PG but get another test in a few weeks to be sure. You can actually make yourself worry so much about being PG that you get phantom symptoms.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Don't use caps hunny it makes your post very hard to read.... if your last period was January 19 that would make you 6 weeks pregnant you'd certainly test positive. You're probably just irregular are you young?|`|hOkmcVeDaa	My last pregnancy i was like 5 days late before a got a positive test.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	UNcircumcised aka intact penises should never be retracted by the parent, that should be left to the child when they are old enough to do so and the foreskin moves easily.  Some foreskins are not retractable until 18 years of age or older, and some aren't retractable until the man first has sex (rather like a female losing her virginity).  However the foreskin commonly becomes retractable around 5 years.<br>  <br>  As an aside CIRCUMCISED penises do need to have the foreskin retracted at least once per day until the child is out of diapers because irritation can cause skin adhesions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/easy.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/easy.h...</a><br>  During infancy and early childhood, only the outside of the intact penis needs to be rinsed with warm water. The foreskin should not be retracted during cleaning. It's that simple.<br>  <br>  There is much unnecessary anxiety over the issue of hygiene. It is not at all difficult to maintain proper hygiene. “...health professionals generally agree that uncircumcised boys do not have any special hygienic problems.” Concern for proper hygiene is over emphasized, and so the needless practice of routine circumcision continues.<br>  <br>  Overzealous cleaning attempts can cause posthitis, urinary tract infections and phimosis. People are surprised to learn that the intact penis requires no special care. The best advice is to simply leave it alone.<br>  Consider providing your doctor with an Intact Care Agreement.<br>  <br>  Usually starting around the age of 5 or 6, boys should be taught to retract their own foreskins once a week and rinsing with warm water. Sometimes the separation process takes longer and a boy may not be able to fully retract his foreskin until he is 10 or more. This is normal and not cause for alarm. Once the foreskin is retractable , the instructions for cleaning are simple.<br>  <br>  1.) Gently pull the foreskin back.<br>  <br>  2.) Rinse with warm water only. Soap under the foreskin can cause irritation and swelling.<br>  <br>  3.) Pull the foreskin back in place over the head of your penis.<br>  <br>  No one should do this for him. He can pull the foreskin back by himself gently. After rinsing, he simply pulls the foreskin back into place. (Cleaning inspections are not required.) We do not pull out our teeth to prevent cavities -- we brush them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h...</a><br>  Does my son's foreskin need special cleaning?<br>  <br>  The uncircumcised penis is easy to keep clean. When your son is an infant, bathe or sponge him frequently and wash all body parts, including the genitals. You do not need to do any special cleansing, such as with cotton swabs or antiseptics. Simply wash the head of the penis and the inside fold of the foreskin with [mild!] soap and warm water. [Or rather, just wash the outside of the penis as a whole. The inner fold of the foreskin will look after itself.] Remember, do not try to forcibly retract the foreskin. You should watch your baby urinate to be sure that the hole in the foreskin is large enough to allow a normal stream. [You probably won't have much choice!] Consult your pediatrician if:<br>  <br>  * the stream of urine is never heavier than a trickle<br>  * your baby seems to have some discomfort while urinating.<br>  <br>  If the foreskin becomes inflamed, a common cause is the fungus monilia, which can cause redness and itching. This can be easily treated with an antifungal cream. If the foreskin becomes considerably red or swollen, see your pediatrician. If your son's foreskin is fully retracted before puberty, an occasional retraction with cleansing beneath will do. [He can do it himself.] Once your son starts puberty, he should retract the foreskin and clean beneath it on a daily basis. It should become a part of your son's total body hygiene, just like shampooing his hair and brushing his teeth. Teach your son to clean his foreskin by:<br>  <br>  * gently pulling it back away from the glans<br>  * rinsing the glans and inside fold of the foreskin with [mild] soap and warm water<br>  * [rinsing with water only]<br>  * pulling the foreskin back over the head of the penis.<br>  <br>  Caring for your son's uncircumcised penis requires no special action. Remember, foreskin retraction will occur naturally and should never be forced. Once boys begin to bathe themselves, they will need to wash their penis just as they do any other body part. [This excellent paragraph might have substituted for all the other worrisome advice before it.]<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd...</a><br>  The self-cleaning functions of the intact penis are analogous to the self-cleaning properties of the eyelid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi...</a><br>  The intact penis is a self-cleaning organ that produces smegma (a creamy substance also produced by females, containing dead cells and immunological substances) to combat infection<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o..." rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o...</a><br>  The mucosal genitalia, like the mucosal eyes and mouth, are self-cleaning and self-defending, and it could not possibly be otherwise. Moreover, mid-19th century British and American boys (and girls) did not suddenly develop filthy genitals which needed aggressive hygiene after their ancestors, for hundreds of generations, survived nicely on benign neglect.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	You're not suppose to pull it back because in some cases it remains attached to the head of the penis. My son who's 8 isn't circumsized and I never pulled it back. The penis is an orifice like any other and NEEDS a certain amount of bacteria to keep itself running well. My son  showers every other day and has never had a problem with cleaning his own wiener:)|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	Talk to your pediatrician about it you'll get many different answers on hear some are right but some are wrong and it's best to talk to someone who will know and give you the right advice especially because it could potentially cause harm to your son|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	No - leave it alone!  It doesn't start to retract yet and you can damage it.  Once he is old enough to clean it himself than it is usually retractable by then.|`|WIeCX71Daa	Never ever pull back the foreskin on your toddlers penis, it is fused to the head to prevent infection and muck getting underneath it.  By the time they are around 5ish the foreskin will release and they your son will have to be taught how to clean it properly.|`|GU3RauKOaa	No don't!<br>  <br>  My husband is uncut and his had not fully detached by around 10 years old so he decided to force it himself (no one ever told him it was normal!). It bled and the skin around the head of his penis is still rough and slightly scarred to this day. Its normal for it to pull back on its own anytime between now and puberty, so don't force it. But do clean whatever is accesible.|`|035f0c618509868724b99b045ce88d86aa	DO NOT forcibly retract the penis skin to clean it. you can cause serious damage to the foreskin. clean it soap and water. it will start to retract on its own around 4-5.|`|wphI41wNaa	Yes because stuff can get caught up in it and that needs to cleaned. When you do it just go about as if it were a normal thing to do then teach him how to do it himself|`|uclo2Um1aa	NO NO NO ! Do not force his skin back. Most boys skin does not fully retract until they are 5 to 8 years old. so dont make something a problem that is fine right now.<br>  I think it's great that you didn't circumcise him|`|RzYePezkaa	You are supposed to clean it at diaper changes because it can get bacteria there from everything.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Yes you pull back the skin and clean it thoroughly. It does not take that long. Think of an inney belly button they get dirty too.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	No!!! until the foreskin releases on it's own (before the onset of puberty) his body produces a vernix like substance which keeps the area under his foreskin clean and safe from infection. If you force the foreskin back to clean under it you will most likely tear the thin tissues and make it possible for him to get a bad infection. clean the outer areas at every diaper change but never pull back the foreskin.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	No no no no no!<br>  <br>  Never pull back the foreskin, it can lead to problems.  The only person to retract the foreskin should be your son, and when he's old enough to be able do this himself is a good indicator that he *should* be doing it.  Some links below for more info for you :)
apUkTo3maa	YEAH YOU ALSO GET CRAMPS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PREGO. IM SURE YOU ARE SINCE YOU ALREADY HAD 3 TEST POSITIVE|`|IVympPe0aa	Yeah, you're definitely pregnant. There aren't many false positives. It will be a very long time before you can feel baby, but it is very common to feel cramps in the beginning.

q4JMjvGLaa	You can still be pregnant and have your so-called period. My mother had her period during her entire pregnancy with me and she did not find out she was pregnant until she was 6 months because of this. Many people think that this cannot occur but it can. I also have other relatives in my family who have experienced the same thing. And your symptoms could be Norovirus because a lot of people have been sick with it lately particularly in my hometown. Maybe you should consider a birth control method that would best fit your needs to avoid being worried about situations like this in the future. I'm not trying to preach but I'm just giving you some helpful advice. Take Care of Yourself! I wish you the best!|`|bo4MguzVaa	you cannot be pregnant and have a period<br>  <br>  you can be pregnant and have implantation bleeding<br>  <br>  you can get pregnant and have an early miscarriage which would appear to be a period (this happened to a friend of mine who was having problems getting and staying pregnant)<br>  <br>  you can also just be sick<br>  <br>  Use condoms, you'll either get pregnant or start an STD collection or BOTH.

J3yUXKiyaa	Spotting mid cycle is very normal, and can occur at any point.  Doesn't mean you're pregnant.  Cramping and spotting at the mid point of your cycle (and you're pretty darned close to the average time for that) is known as mittelschmerz - linked to ovulation.  I get that once in a while...it'll pop up for a cycle or two, then not happen again for a few years.  If that's all it is with you, totally normal.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	are you on birth control
mTyu7CKoaa	take a test|`|rHufcHwHaa	if you've missed a period, take a test.  it would show up positive by now.  Good luck!|`|htD82ij1aa	Why is it so hard for all these girls to understand, unprotected sex + missing period = Very VERY likely pregnancy, is a condom a difficult thing? I don't think so.  Obviously the school systems are missing some very important sex education and parents don't want to go there.|`|SvQiJKgIaa	having a unplanned pregnancy is scary but at this point i would really take a test as soon as i get up in the morning good luck|`|LyVjjelGaa	i bet you are....especially if u are late for ur period....TAKE A TEST!|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	When the website said that fertilization occurs approximately two weeks after the first day of your period, it's referring to what's known as the pregnancy wheel. The pregnancy wheel assumes that you always have a 28 day cycle and always ovulate on day 14. This is a very dangerous myth, because it can cause women to think they're pregnant when they're not, that they aren't pregnant when they are, and it has caused many couples to think that they're having infertility problems and go through expensive, unnecessary tests! <br>  <br>  That slight spotting could be one of two things. It could be ovulatory spotting or implantation spotting. If it is ovulatory spotting, it means that you're just now ovulating, and there's no way you're pregnant. If it's implantation spotting, then you are pregnant, and you would have conceived about ten days ago, meaning you would have ovulated about four days after having unprotected intercourse.<br>  <br>  Considering you say that this spotting isn't normal for you, I am going to guess that it is implantation spotting. However, keep in mind that yes, your cycle can change as you go through different stages of life! <br>  <br>  Sperm can live within the female body for five days maximum, and that's under ideal conditions, when the woman is producing fertile-quality cervical fluid. This cervical fluid looks like raw egg whites, and is stretchy. Otherwise, the sperm can only live in your body for a few hours. <br>  <br>  At this point, it's most likely too early for a home pregnancy test to detect the pregnancy hormone. I would wait at least another week before testing. If it's negative, it might be a false negative, so wait another week and test again if you still don't get your period. <br>  <br>  I hope this help. Lots of luck, and best wishes to your new baby if you are pregnant!|`|3f2d97b79431e4fb65d2aa9737e13c11aa	You should just take a test. Its the best thing if you are you find out if your not than you don't have to worry about being pregnant but about solving why you are feeling that way.

If it was me I'd buy a test on friday, and if it came out negative I'd wait 5 more days and if I still didn't have my period I'd take another test.<br>  <br>  When I found out I was pregnant, I took a test on the day I should have started my period and it was positive.

EWHWPC2Taa	as they say "what goes up must come down" it does not matter if your semen comes out as you withdraw its normal, like others have said get your wife to put a pillow under hur bottom or lower back so she is raised this could help but it dosent matter or prove results. try using an ovulation calculator/calender, you may find that this will help in getting your wife pregnant as you will be able to tell when she is ovulating therfor at her most fertile~!<br>  <br>  hope ive helped, best of luck and god bless you both.|`|edzU8VJiaa	This is normal.  <br>  <br>  Sperm IS automatically released when you ejaculate; your semen contains the sperm and, although much of it will flow out afterward, enough should remain to do the job.<br>  <br>  However, if you are trying for a baby, your wife could try putting a couple of pillows under her hips and staying like that for 20 minutes after you have ejaculated.  There is no guarantee, though, and if you start getting worried and fussing too much about it, this could prevent her conceiving anyway.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	This is common, as is the semen dripping when she stands up. Tell her to lay on her back with her feet in the air, perhaps some pillows under her butt.|`|T8fZOmdOaa	My boyfriend gets this aswel sometimes- Im not sure what causes it though.<br>  If you are trying for a baby- get her to lie on her back and part her legs, and raise her pelvis in the air as high at she can go, balancing on her feet and shoulder blades/upper back.<br>  This keeps the sperm in longer and flows it up further into the vagina and therefore gives them a better chance of reaching the egg.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps!|`|dMvsVqS2aa	after sex try getting her to lay down for 15 or so mins with her butt elevated under a pillow.

DBKV3g4baa	I think your idea is great, however the supplies can get pretty costly.  I would suggest asking a local business to donate the bottles, or possibly to match your contribution.  Also, after your fundraiser/contest is over, you could donate the bottles also - just be sure to inform the staff at The Lighthouse that they would need to be completely sanitized.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could look for baby bottles at a dollar store or Goodwill.<br>  <br>  To get teachers involved, you could have a juice/milk/water chugging contest.  Which ever teacher can finish a bottle of the chosen drink first wins.  You can also do races to dress/change a doll.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I think it's great you're doing something like this.

Let us know how it goes.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That's very sweet of you and I think it's a great idea.

537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I did the same thing when my son was born at 32 weeks.  Make sure you are looking at a picture of him while you pump.  Also get a second set of attachments so you are not washing them in the middle of the night.  Also sometimes it just takes a long time, maybe even a half hour.  Try to relax, almost feel like you're in a trance.|`|P7VdWn7baa	My son was in the hospital also, at 3 months( a couple weeks ago)<br>  He had the RSV virus. And I actually slept there 5 days! because I was breastfeeding him he would not take a bottle. He refused. He needed me and I understood that. I would just keep trying the more you try the better. Gl hope your baby is ok.
NaW6epGPaa	You are not a freak, and I wouldn't worry about it. It's absolutley  natural for a boy your age to have a large penis. It just mean that you had a growth spurt.  In the long run you'll be glad to have that MONSTER LOL. But serious its nothing to be ashamed of. When I was 14 I knew plenty of boys that had a penis that size, and as for trying to keep it from not being so erect, try not thinking about sexual things, such as sexual fantasy's another other things that may make you erect. I hope this help. As for those people that say you are a freak, they just jealous that they don't have a larger penis. They hatin on you.|`|hOjH3Iipaa	Sounds like you've just gone through a major growth spurt, you'll be fine. As to the "stiffies" try thinking unsexy thoughts, like think about a really gross hairy fat older male you know, or even a really gross hairy older female. I'm pretty sure it's common for this sort of thing to happen at your age, you'll grow out of it or learn to control it after a while. Talk to a trusted male friend about this sort of thing.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	There are a couple girls who seem to be stroking your ego, and I wanted to let you know that not every girl prefers a huge penis.  In fact, there are some of us with relatively small lady bits, where anything larger than "average" hurts.<br>  <br>  It's not about the size of the vessel, it's about the motion of the ocean.  (It's not about how big, it's about how you use it.)|`|AusPef8Yaa	Everyone is rather different. Just do something to keep your mind off it. Take a cold shower in the morning to keep your mind away from things like that.|`|XrKviWgSaa	your having hormones and you cant stop it from happening, if it does happen just tuck it somewhere to where no one can see it and yeah that is pretty large my boyfriend is 20 and only about 7|`|7odvGjkXaa	tuck it up in the waist. and damn ya thats pretty big, actually thats crazy big. im 14 and 7 and i'm big so you're crazy
ybzD9s9raa	Introduce Veggies first.. They prefer fruits because they are sweeter and taste better. So if you introduce fruits first, you will have a hard time getting them to eat veggies. It also aids in their digestion better to eat veggies first|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Some recommend veggies first, as naturally babies may prefer the taste of sugar/fruits.|`|zwctZ812aa	Start with the vegetables and then do the fruits.  The fruits are sweet and she will probably like them more, so if you start with them it may be hard to get her to eat the veggies.  Are you starting cereal at 4 or 6 months? If at 4 months, wait to six months to start any other solids.  If you're doing 6 months, you could either skip the cereal all together, or wait a couple weeks then introduce the other solids.|`|nPtzoAmAaa	Peds used to say inroduce veggies first, but thing shave changed and now I've had two say it didn't really matter. I did applesauce first and my boy loved it of course, then did bananas, he loved those too. Then carrots and guess what, same outcome. He also is crazy about peas, lol, but hates and I means HATES the green beans, go figure. Anyways start them on what you feel like starting them on, they either decide they like it or don't. <br>  <br>  Now that my son is 9months he eats boiled veggies and I have to say he likes green beans, he just didn't like the the canned ones. So just try them out one by one, in no particular order and see what they think. It's always fun to see what they like and don't like.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I started with cereal for 1 week and then went to veggies (green then orange).  Now I am on fruits.  They say to wait at least 4 days to make sure there aren't any allergies (I waited longer just because.)  Good luck!|`|h59Bc4wfaa	You're supposed to start with the orange veggies. Carrots, sweet taters, squash...<br>  <br>  And if she's doing well with the cereal, she can handle 1st food.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	cereals are better.|`|qmFpYwppaa	It really doesn't matter if you introduce fruits or vegetables first.  The important thing is that you introduce them one at at time and wait probably about a week before introducing a new food.  That is to determine if your baby has an allergy to the food.  If you feed the new foods too close together and there is a reaction, you won't know which food it is that caused it.|`|wmc7uHLIaa	Give rice cereal for at least 1 month.  You want to work it up to where she is getting cereal 3 times a day.  After that, I was told to start my son on orange veggies first (carrots, squash, sweet potatoes) and then to add fruits.  He eats cereal for breakfast, veggie + fruit for lunch, and then cereal for dinner and he is 8 months now.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	once the child is able to sit unassisted u can start weaning him/her with semi solid food anf after 2 or 3 more months lumpy food dont give him/her solids till has enough teeth to chew on it. u can introduce a new food every 2 to 3 days to give time for allergy check etc.... fruits and vegetables are both fine...fruits probably not more than every second or third day since you are just starting.... once she starts eating regularly once a day will be fine....|`|erKyfwSbaa	Try both. It's whatever your baby prefers. And watching the facial reactions is priceless!  I would avoid too many banana's though.

You can even mix the cereal in the fruit to make it taste a little better.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Both are good. First food fruits and first vegetables. I wouln't wait long b4 start her on single grai especially if she is a year old.|`|IXJ1FzJMaa	Veggies first because they will get used to the fruits and won't eat their vegetables.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	veggies bc if u start with sweet they will only eat sweet|`|6jXgOuUPaa	its better if you do a mix. mix both flavors. babies love that. it doesnt mater what flavors you mix with what they love it all. lol. <br>  <br>  but dont give your baby sweets first because more then likely they wont want the vegies when you give it to them...they'll prefer the sweets. <br>  <br>  when they start getting use to eating their vegies then you can give them the sweets if you want to do it one by one :)<br>  good luck.

c5AJGcYcaa	First things first... find out if you are actually pregnant.....<br>  Second, if you do not want to have the abortion don't have it. A man can only give you his opinion, but it's your body and ultimately your choice!|`|rHufcHwHaa	he can't make the choice for you.  If you want to have a baby, have the baby.  Just understand that he may not be willing to stay with you and support you through the pregnancy.  It is called the woman's right to choose though, and that means that he has no say in the decision at all.  Good luck.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, you tell him that no you are not getting the abortion and you keep the baby if that's what you want to do. Talk to him about it, tell him your views on everything. He can't force you to do it.

It sounds like he's thinking of a pregnancy as a disposable option. <br>  <br>  If it's any consolation, many men change their minds after seeing a baby. My husband was not ready for a baby and has turned out to be a wonderful father.|`|jD8TxlLfaa	If you get an abortion when you don't want one, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. It's your body. Not his. If you want to keep the baby, keep it.<br>  <br>  But before you worry about anything I'd make sure you're actually pregnant.|`|XEiIYjT7aa	It's simple. Don't kill your baby! What you have growing inside of you is a miracle, and I think you know that. If he isn't ready to take on the responsibility of being a father, he should not have taken on the responsibility of having sex with you. <br>  <br>  You will regret an abortion for your entire life, trust me. Especially if you are against it. If you look up how developed your baby is now, I think you would definitely be revulsed at the fact that you'd be killing an actual child. Fingers and toes, a heartbeat, a forming brain, and yes, even movement are happening at this stage. Love your baby, enjoy your pregnancy, and if he isn't on board, tell him to take a hike. It's not worth the mental and emotional anguish you would feel if you went with what he wants.|`|bo4MguzVaa	Wow that is the dumbest thing I ever heard....I mean he wants you to kill the baby, but make another one a little later?<br>  <br>  That makes no sense<br>  <br>  If you get an abortion that you don't want just cause he does, you will resent him and be depressed, and having a different baby with him later will most likely not happen.  (I had a friend who had a similar situation, and chose the wrong choice)<br>  <br>  Dont do it!|`|k54YiHIeaa	abortions are inhumane. if you dont know how they perform an abortion ill tell you. theres many ways but ill discribe the most common. in a suction aspiration they force open ur cervix with metal clasps which is extremely painful. they then  stick a curette into your vagina which is a long instrument with a sharp point kinda like a knife. and they cut up the baby and then suck it out with a vaccuum through a tube. if they leave any body parts behind it can become infected and lead to other problems. in a saline injection they stick a long needle through ur abdomen and into the amniotic sac. they inject a salt poisoning which burns the baby alive and sends it into convulsions which you can feel. they then pull out the dead baby. abortions are horrible and can affect you for the rest of your life. many people have to go to physicitrists after this bc they are so scarred for life. its incredibly disgusting to even think about. if its your baby keep it. dont let him influence your choice. its yours! he has no right to try to influence you. keep it! or give it up to adoption. i just beg you not to kill an innocent child.|`|p4R1c6fraa	The baby is in there now.What does it matter waiting another year or two.He's asking you to do something you'll regret for the rest of your life.You need to ask yourself who is more important,you or the guy.Nobody should be asked to make this choice.He doesn't have to go through with the emotional trauma or the procedure.Please pray on this.God is listening and he also blessed you with this baby.|`|vWb8fquvaa	If you are against abortions then I think you have your answer. Adoption is your other choice if you are not wanting to raise your baby yourself|`|PeOCqztoaa	If you are against it DON'T DO IT! The last thing you want is to regret that for the rest of your life.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	keep the baby ...dump him ....give baby up for an adoption|`|YdzzWAsRaa	do not do abortion, you will regret later on|`|97361e0bea1a7c814e1e0591ab668edaaa	What do you want? it will be your decision in the end, look at Your life ,your finances and if you can afford to do it without him and want to keep your baby go ahead.Taking the life of your unborn child isn't right but you have to make the decision that suits you best. What if when you are ready in a year or two you guys aren't together anymore? No matter what we tell you, its all up to you, your the one carrying the child, all the best to you|`|xJuvqG7Haa	don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  that someones life inside of you you'll never know what that baby could achieve in life. in a year or 2 that baby will be saying mommy and daddy why wait when you can have it now and what ever he says talk to someone like your sister or mom|`|uclo2Um1aa	No way !  <br>  Don't you let him talk you in to something you dont want to do. <br>  As you know YOU will have to live with that forever and that might not be with him. <br>  <br>  Remember you principals, and don't do it !

0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Nothing.  He sleeps in his swaddle with nothing in his crib.  Anything would be a SIDS risk.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We gave him a couple small blankets to sleep with at 7 months. He cannot go to sleep without them now. Once I hand them to him his head immediately goes down on Daddy's shoulder and his eyes close, super cute!|`|zwctZ812aa	Nope, my 4 month old just sleeps in his crib with his binky.  I am too afraid to give him a stuffed animal or a blanket because I'm paranoid and think he could potentially smother himself.  I just put a space heater in his room to keep it warm for him.|`|OZjOqI43aa	My son is 3 years old now, but when he was an infant he slept with his special blanket his grandma made him. He still sleeps with it even though we had a new one made, he got too tall for his baby blanket! Now he sleeps with both blankets. He insists the old one be the first blanket on, and then the new one on top of that. Whatever makes him happy and sleep at night! :D|`|SjX72fPyaa	My 5 month old has a teething kitty. Pretty much a teething blanket with a cat head. She won't sleep without it.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son sleeps with a blanket now. Hes 9 months.

That way they are not attached to it so much that it has to go every where and they don't go to sleep without it. They love them but if they have to go one night without them they don't raise a fuss. Good Luck|`|yDp2hNc5aa	My son is a year old and has never slept with anything special. Just whatever blanket we put on him. When his sister was a baby (she's 3 now) she would only sleep with the precious moments blanket her aunt made. It's a small light weight quilt and I think anything else was just too heavy. Now she has to sleep with the nice soft blanket that I got for Christmas.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	a 9 month-old baby doesnt need to sleep with anything... in fact try to aviod putting soft pillows, stuffed toys etc next to him to prevent possible smothering or suffocating during sleep. also donot overheat him during sleep. a light blanket will do.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	he slept with us until he was 9m then switched him to the crib....he loves his musical crib aquarium to go to sleep with|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	well being that young they dont even really understand what a lovee is but a stuff animal will do,or blanket,get em ready so when he/she gets older they will call and knw that it's there lovee|`|wmc7uHLIaa	His thumb   :)|`|P7VdWn7baa	~ME~ he sleeps with me im his pillow, stuffed what ever,,, i am it. lol|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	When my son and daughter were 9months they slept with their favorite dolls.

tcHkn0VIaa	Personally I like Addie Mae better. that is hard because I love Lilly but that does not go well with either Addie or Lucille. It is hard to get in both with my grandmothers I have Vena Mae or Nancy Louise- I love them dearly but i decided to leave these out of the hat for name picking.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	u know it sounds dumb but if thats a rememberance type name then go for it|`|35JIECGRaa	Lucille Mae, to me, doesn't flow well together (but they are both nice names) ... I would suggest maybe Addie Mae, or even Lilly Lucille because they both flow nicely and they're equally pretty!<br>  <br>  (Mae is my mom's middle name, and I always thought about maybe having a daughter named Lily Mae)|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	lucille is too old school, sorry.how about addilyn,madilyn,macey,cecelia(stretching it a bit!),iliana,maelia,dahlia,lydia, eila, della,idella,lucia,madea,adele, or camille perhaps.Good Luck!|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	Lucille Mae is nice.  Addie Mae would also be really cute.|`|ljFBfguRaa	Only if she'll go by Lucy.<br>  I like Addie Mae better.|`|LARRqcqsaa	i love it as lucille mae|`|z6TI1ZDDaa	Good for you!  Your grandmothers will be honored.  Beautiful, old fashioned names.  Lucille is French and means "light"; Mae is English and means "month of may".  All around delightful.|`|E6A8MKZwaa	I agree with everyone else.  Lucille is old sounding.  I don't think your daughter would appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Lilly Lucille or Addie Mae are much better.  Addie Mae is really cute, actually.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Great name! I love Lucille Mae as she can just shorten it when she gets older to Lucy. Love it!!!!|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	Lilly Mae.|`|6aoJhFp4aa	That sounds really pretty!!|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i like it its an old fashion name.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	lucille? poor kid. she sounds like a hick child.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	Lilly Mae is my pick or you could do Lillyanna (still has part of her name in there) Addison (still has part of her name in it) and think it is prettier and if you want you can nickname her Lilly or Addie but it is up to you :) If you went with Lucille I would pick the second name as Adele if you are trying to keep something close to Addie. How about Lucy or Lilly(anna) Mae Addison? Lucy Mae sounds the best out of your picks.I personally don't like the names and I understand you wanting to honor their memory in your child's name but these names do not flow at all....Maybe pick one of their names and pair it with a new name?|`|3826adc66a474e595f95d7925d39a547aa	I like this name! Lucille Mae. it's pretty. I've also always loved the name Addie. but I think Lucille Mae is a winner. So pretty. It's very sweet of you to put your grandmothers' names in you future baby names! So thoughtful!|`|tWV1aVS9aa	Lucia Mae or Allie Mae <br>  <br>  I think Lucy Mae is cute but Lucille Mae is also a beautiful name.|`|opiXLlz1aa	How about Lilly Lucille or Addie May... The Lucille may is cute but it kinda makes me think of a name that would be on beverly hillbillies.. Im not trying to be mean by that either.. becuase i do like the names|`|b4CzVvBqaa	Addie Mae. It kind of rolls off of the tung. But hey, do what you want.|`|DPkwvSjcaa	Very pretty|`|FIOOKpz0aa	I think Addie Mae is cuter,<br>  but besides that I like Lucille Mae|`|druYkultaa	how about Lillian Addison?|`|ioGfuwOPaa	I know someone named Lily Mae Jane.<br>  Pretty name.|`|VNgBIVk5aa	I really like Addie Mae.|`|zm8Q7xn2aa	i adore the name lucille! go for it!|`|93zL6EIYaa	i dont like lucille its sounds old|`|XtWSiFPsaa	cute! and old fashioned! my favorite is lilly mae but they're all cute
ziw77iuPaa	I dont think your pregnant.<br>  I know a lot of females who have gotten pregnant from pre *** though. But you cant pregnant usualyy till 2 weeks after your period...|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's possible for you to get pregnant from pre-ejaculate fluid. It's unlikely due to the timing of it, that you just got off your period and were most likely not ovulating, but it is still possible. It's too early to test though, you need to wait until your period is due.|`|8SkcYhY4aa	You cant get pregnant until 2 weeks or so after your period ends because thats when you ovulate. And you cant get pregnant unless you ovulate and release an egg. After your period ends your new egg hasnt even formed yet its in the process so theres no way it would ovulate. Your fine!!!<br>  <br>  Edit- y the thumbs down?|`|IXJ1FzJMaa	wait two weeks to take the test because he is right. even if it the test is negative make an appointment with planned parenthood for a blood test to determine whether you are pregnant or not. if so find a OBGYN.<br>  asap for prenatal care.|`|Ml0BHEtuaa	yes, it is possible to get pregnant from precum, it does hold sperm.<br>  <br>  u should take a test (First Response) five days before your next period is scheduled to come!|`|WZQKevt8aa	I doubt you are pregnant, if you are still worried, wait until your period is due and do a test if it doesn't come.

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hmm, that's strange they told you 28 weeks, I don't know anyone who had to wait that long. Usually they give you an ultrasound between weeks 18-22 and you can find out the gender at that time.|`|rHufcHwHaa	he should be able to tell at 18-22 weeks...i've never heard of a doctor saying 28 weeks.  Although, it's going to be unquestionable at 28 weeks.  I'd ask a nurse or the U/S technician...they can usually tell by 20 weeks.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	I've never heard of ANYONE waiting more than like 22 weeks to get the ultrasound to find out the gender. That's ridiculous. What is your doctor's reasoning behind this? I found out at 21 weeks, and everyone always finds out between 18-22 weeks. That sounds really weird to me, maybe get a new doctor. The whole purpose of the ultrasound that determines gender is an anatomy scan to make sure that the baby is developing correctly and it just so happens that they can tell the gender as well, so I could never see a doctor waiting that long for that kind of procedure!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Most people get the anatomy scan around 18-20 weeks... that's strange that your doctor said this. Perhaps you can get an ultrasound from a different provider to find out sooner if the doctor won't do it before 28 weeks.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i found out at 20weeks he just might want to make sure cuz it would b more developed|`|PymLdXM8aa	Although the babies genitalia is developed by this time most doctor's and US techs will wait until the 5th month. YOu baby at this time is getting bigger and they have a better chance of the baby facing the right way or moving so you can see the sex. I have known quite a few women who have not been able to find out the sex with their first US. And most of them were in their 4th month. But i have never heard of 28 weeks. They do not only do the US so you can find out he sex... they do it to measure and look at the babies organs to make sure the child is developmenting correctly. WHich generally should be done half way through which is about 20 weeks.<br>  <br>  I know that it is agonizing! I was also under the assumption that i would get the referral for the US at 18 weeks but my doctor asked me if we were planning on trying to find out and when we told her yes she decided that it would be much more successful if we waited, also we would have a greater chance because the baby is significantly larger by the 22nd week. So we decided to wait and that was the longest month of my life! LOL. But she told me the same thing... that they have a lot of women ( especially first time Mom's like myself)  that insist on having it at 17 or 18 weeks instead of waiting the extra 3 or 4 and then they have to go back and pay to have another one done to find out. Personally I am happy that we waited an extra month, my grandma works in  post-partum as an RN and she worked delivery for years... she said that mistaking the sex on an US is not that uncommon still, even though we have better technology. And that would suck! LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OOh and other people will be able to feel your baby now, just have him lay with you on the couch or something and have him keep his hand on your belly where you feel most frequent movement. It will be faint, but he'll be able to feel it!|`|N4ExAFmOaa	The baby is developed enough at 18 weeks to determine the sex. Why your doctor is making you wait is beyond me. I found out around 20 weeks with my last one. I would talk to your doctor to see if you could have an ultrasound earlier. Congratulations, and good luck with you and your new baby.|`|IbliNY9Jaa	that is weird. like everyone else said, they usually do it between 18-22 weeks. i got an ultrasound at 16 weeks 4 days and found out i was having a boy. the ultrasound technician said that the earliest she could tell the sex of the baby was 14 weeks. it seem strange that your doctor is making you wait so long.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	27wks is when I found out it depends sometimes on the baby. about 5 1\2 months mayb 6months is when the babies really active ur boyfriend and you should feel him kick then. Don't worry time will fly by and you will be picking out blue or pink soon.|`|1w41ReD7aa	You can find out as early as 15weeks. I'm going to a 3D/4D ultrasound in3 weeks,when I'm 15weeks to find out the sex. Goodluck&Congradulations!|`|IYULF7NDaa	wow that's pretty far. I found out at 20 weeks as well. Try talking with your doc about moving that time back. If that doesn't work you could always pay for one.

Did they do a trans-vaginal one too?|`|p4R1c6fraa	Some women's HCG levels are just slow moving.If you are very concerned then talk to your doctor.It's their job to ease your mind.I wish you well and God  bless.

Let Miss Cleo help you out as I drink from the magic nectars of our great world.<br>  <br>  Looking into my crystal ball, I tell you...<br>  <br>  you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a lovely day, my love|`|WmKjeUELaa	We need more information than that dear.  I'm not really sure what you are referring to as a noise.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Uh, no probably not whether you are pregnant or not. You might hear some GI noises if you prod your abdomen but that has nothing to do with pregnancy.
idrLEQZ7aa	4-5 bottles for a 12 month old might be too many.  At 12 months we were told to start cutting the bottle down to 2 cups of milk a day.  We have a really good schedule down now and my kids almost know it like clock work.  They wake up at 7am-7:30 each morning.  Eat breakfast (no bottle), then they play for a bit.  A morning snack later on, with lunch at noon (no bottle here either, just a sippy cup).  After lunch they take thier one and only nap which is about 1 1/2 hours tops.  Then they are up the rest of the day until 7:30pm when its bed time.  Maybe try more sippy cups than bottles.  Is he eating anything before he goes to bed? Maybe his tummy is not quite full to keep him sleeping through the night? How many ounces is he drinking before bed? i'd give him the full 8 oz at bedtime with some rice cereal or something to try to hold him over till morning.  It takes some time to get a good schedule going, but you'll be happier when you have one, and he'll be better sleeping too during the night.|`|7V5NI2HXaa	my son is 7 months and he's kinda the same way if i just put him in his crib awake...so we have to rock him to sleep in his stroller till he's in deep sleep then we put him in his crib...he then lasts up to 9 or 10 hours sleeping.....try it!!! (not for sure though) good luck!!!|`|HM0cxcahaa	Some women will thumb me down but  i went through similar<br>  <br>  1. Get rid of the dummy if there is nothing to lose there is nothing to wake up for<br>  2. No more night feeds, he is old enough - from 6-8 months they dont need night feeds<br>  3. Controlled crying - just dont go in there!!!!, let him scream the house down, it could be hours and days and test you mentally, but I did this and as soon as my daughter realised 2 days later that it was not going to work anymore she became a 12 hour sleeper.<br>  <br>  Some different methods<br>  <br>  <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/controlled_comforting.html" rel="nofollow">http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bubhub.com.au/community/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=146" rel="nofollow">http://www.bubhub.com.au/community/forum...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askbaby.com/Baby-sleep-training.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askbaby.com/Baby-sleep-traini...</a>|`|AA10572259	Maybe he needs a little more sleep during the day.  My daughter always slept well and only went through phases of getting up a lot at night.  When she did at that age I would make sure nothing was wrong and let her cry back to sleep.  I would say it only took a day or two and she would start sleeping well again.  Get him into a schedule and make sure when you go into his room at night that you leave the light off, don't really interact with him much.  Let him know that its night time.  Maybe start letting him cry a little longer each time he wakes up and see if he will go back to sleep.  Good luck with the new baby.
692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I dont believe you can spoil a child that young, however they do learn what works for them :)  You say she started this at 2 days, so its part of her personality and who she is.. my son was like this, omg i couldn't go to the bathroom without him, it drove me insane.. everyone would say just let him cry, your spoiling him bla bla bla, well i couldn't just let him cry, it broke my heart.  Good news is she will grow out of it :)  Once she starts crawling and moving around more on her own, she will need you less.  My daughter is almost 4 months, i pick her up any time she wants me too and i rarely put her down, however when i do she lets me, for as long as i need to put her down.  I do the same thing with her that i did with my son, she is just less demanding and dependent.|`|BKbEE9qZaa	I think it's important to earn a baby's trust in the beginning months, but I agree 7 months you can start leaving her a little longer. Maybe try setting her down and then instead of just walking away spend time with her that way? That is of course, if you haven't already tried?|`|8t8NjjnVaa	No, not exactly.  It's IS true that you cannot spoil a baby under a YEAR old.<br>  <br>  She needs Mommy.  Is this really something you need to teach her how to "get over"?|`|oXIYHsDaaa	You can never spoil a baby with love and attention. It sounds like you have a very attached baby, that's a good thing. You're lucky a lot of girls aren't that cuddly so enjoy it while it lasts. You could always try using a sling or wrap carrier so you can have your hands free to do other stuff but really she will grow out of it and before you know it she wont want you to even hold her hand anymore.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Everything I have read or heard about would say that is true 4/5 months and under, but at 7 months it is time to start breaking behaviors such as these, unless your baby was a premie.
vygYFdsSaa	That's much too soon to be showing. I was bloated and nauseous.|`|256cVXsmaa	at around this time I was a bit bloated so I looked a little heavier.  I actually think around 8-11 weeks I was bigger than I was once I got farther along, just because of how much bloating you get early on.  It will go away though, no worries.  I also started the extreme nausea around that time, I had it all day long.  My breasts were very sore/tender/swollen and vieny.  My lower back ached.  Peeing frequently started around that time I believe.  I also started getting really intense headaches as well at about 6 weeks.|`|rHufcHwHaa	at 5-6 weeks i was tired and had to use the bathroom all the time, but you definitely don't show that early.  your baby is still so small--you can't even see it on an ultrasound.  It's below your pelvic bones.  Your stomach should still feel normal.  You'll start to feel your uterus around 12-14 weeks, and it depends on the person when it comes to how early you'll show.  I was average weight and height (145 at 5'7) before I got pregnant and didn't show til I was 24 weeks.|`|yQVcIfa8aa	you won't show at 5-6 weeks at all, everyone is different but generally pregnant women begin to show after 12 weeks or so, some women don't even show until much later than that. at 5-6 weeks symptoms you may have include, breast tenderness, morning sickness, tiredness, good luck.|`|yKS2UI87aa	4 weeks: I had alcohol aversion which is what prompted me to test when it was 2 days before my period was due. (was told not able to get pregnant w/out drugs but have fun trying)<br>  5-7 weeks: I was not showing yet but pants were tight. I was very tired and my Morning sickness was at night. Good Luck<br>  <br>  I almost forgot, peeing very often (4 times in one hour at a store my bf just laughed)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	A missed period,cramping and no I was not showing.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	5 weeks i was bloated and had alot of morning sickness. i started showing a lot at 3 months|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	You won't show until you're in your second trimester.   I'm 18 weeks with my second baby and I just started to show.  But, I think most people just think I'm a little thick in the middle.  Strangers won't know you're pregnant until you're almost in your third trimester.  Sorry to disappoint.<br>  <br>  You're probably already feeling tired, you might be peeing more often and your breasts might be sore.  In a few more weeks you might get morning sickness (I hope you skip it.).  Then in your second trimester the heartburn and leg cramps might start, but you'll be feeling the baby move!!!<br>  <br>  Congrat's!|`|2252e53ed60c43eb61a998aa057e6810aa	I think it's possibly because you're bloating that's why you think you're showing. And gaining weights has a lot to do with it, too. When I was 5-6 weeks I didn't notice any changes of my stomach, only a little bloating. My symptoms were tiredness, of course, breast soreness, and very tired!! (Did I mention it twice?!?! LOL) I've been lucky with no morning sickness, thank god I'm almost in the 2nd trimester.<br>  Good luck wand enjoy your pregnancy. Take care!!|`|WmKjeUELaa	No, I didn't show until I was around 18 weeks or so.  My symptoms were sore breasts, a little nausea, and feeling depressed at times for no reason.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm 17 weeks and just starting to show.
40Q4gpi6aa	You could be pregnant, but you could also be getting ready to start your period. I suggest to wait until the 6th of this month and see if your period comes. If not, then wait a little longer and then take a test, or just go to the doctor and get tested.|`|H74F8jxuaa	Those sound like pregnancy symptoms.  You are currently on cd 27.  You should get your period tom.  I would take a test in the morning though.  Baby dust!!|`|nISjD0dHaa	It is possible that you are pregnant however, if your cycle started on feb 6th then you are day 26 today so you are not officially late for your period.  I would wait another 3 or 4 days and test if your period has not started.  The areola being bigger does make me thing that you could be pregnant.  Good Luck.|`|wnQRhfczaa	I would wait and see after the 28th day after the 6th just to be sure. Those all sound like pregnancy symptoms but ever since I have been TTC my body has been behaving strangely - believe it or not it is possible to want the symptoms so much that you have them or for your PMS symptoms to change for no reason at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
nISjD0dHaa	Clomid does not cause you to have a bfp sooner.  I belong to a fertililty board and I have seen bfp as soon at 6dpo but that is very rare. Most are not getting bfp until 10dpo or later.  The typical implantation occurs 7-12dpo however it is possible to implant earlier.  I would personally recommend waiting to test until 10dpo-12dpo.  Good Luck.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	No it isn't. A pregnancy test tests for HCG which is the hormone produced after the egg implants in the uterus. It takes 7-10 after ovulation for the egg to implant and produce this hormone. Clomid doesn't speed things up any, just helps you ovulate. <br>  <br>  Some sensitive pregnancy tests can test at 10 DPO, but you should wait till at least 12 DPO so you're not wasting tests and the hormone has a chance to build up.|`|1JqACKIdaa	I took it for 6 months and I got pregnant and found out  by a home test when I was almost 3 weeks.
slxhzLhcaa	i just went through the same thing and bought about 100 hpts...lol my dr said it was just a weirdo period. I hope your case turns out the way you want it to. He said it was nothing to worry about. I just went back in for a progesterone test and he said i ovulated in feb so i guess he was right. Just a odd period. Goodluck and babydust|`|N36YHm7qaa	If your periods are like clock work then worry, but if irregular don't worry sounds like your period is trying to start. Take the test again in about 5 days if still no period.|`|gMOWe2Xfaa	You are either going to start ya af or you may be pregnant. Which if you test in another week and get a bfp than that will be considered as implantation bleeding. It happen to me I had brown discharge but it was my period I thought i was pregnant but I tested negative. so wait another week and test but if you continue to have discharge it may well be your period hope this helps.
Coc593Ikaa	Definitely something that the ladies would like to take home with them! Sometimes people give baby-related prizes that are expected to be given back to the mom-to-be. I personally find this practice tacky and uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Think about your crowd and what they like. Are they older? Are they mostly college students? This may give you some ideas.<br>  <br>  Some old standby options that work for most women:<br>  1. Candles and/or candle holders<br>  2. Gift cards to local stores. Maybe you could somehow them the gift cards to the games?<br>  3. Potted flowers? It is the season for some lovely, cheap potted plants.<br>  4. Pretty stationary like note cards or notepads.<br>  5. Lotions, body wash, body sprays, etc.<br>  <br>  When I threw one, I made small bags that each had a yankee candle and a bottle of bath&body works lotion in them. I then encouraged the ladies to swap around if they wanted to trade scents with other winners.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	perfume, nail polish gift cards, lip gloss ect. stationary. or be silly with bubbles silly string water balloons to celebrate being a kid again.|`|AA11820380	candles, frames, body spray and/or lotion(bath and body works kind)
Z8Ui1ugLaa	You could be pregnant.  Take a home pregnancy test.
V8JoRHnnaa	1) both of u should go<br>  2) History abt exposure to radiations or type of job and sperm analysis of ur hubby<br>  3) ur history of menstrual cycle ,Blood tests for U and u/s<br>  4) if still they dont come up with something then they'll go for hysterosalpingogram<br>  5)treatment depends on diagnosis like for PCO they'll give clomid and metformin,  short luteal phase progesterone is given, for any form of blockage surgery is done<br>  <br>  Baby Dust|`|vue9NOhYaa	I saw a specialist. (Two, in fact.)  And I'd defnitely recommend seeing one.  Regular gyns don't often do the necessary tests and monitoring. (It seems that many just hand out clomid prescriptions and tell you to come back when you're pregnant.)<br>  <br>  Ask your gyn to recommend a specialist, or call your local university connected medical center. <br>  <br>  At your first visit the doctor will probably do a detailed medical history. (Do you have regular periods?  Have you been monitoring your BBT or using OPKs to determine if you're ovulating?  Any history of STDs/PID?  Extremely heavy periods?  Previous pregnancies?  Exposure to chemicals or extreme temps? History of other illnesses that might affect fertility?  Sex patterns? (are you timing things right?) Is there anything that might suggest a problem with hubby? (exposure to heat or chemicals?  Past illnesses?)<br>  <br>  Then, the doc would probably do a regular phyiscal exam, and draw blood for some routine hormone tests (and/or schedule blood work for appropriate times in your cycle) and arrange a semen analysis.  <br>  <br>  Then, depending on what is found, you might have further, more invasive/costly tests. (A dye test to check your tubes, a laproscopy to take a look at your internal organs.)<br>  <br>  Treatment would depend on what's wrong, and might involve surgery, drugs, life-style changes, and so on.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	I think it depends on your insurance.  I'm with an HMO and at an appointment with my OBGYN for a pap smear and I mentioned to her that I'd been trying to conceive for over a year and she gave me a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist (RE).  My husband and I had to go to a 2 hour class on infertility and then we could make an appointment with the RE.<br>  <br>  The first appointment with the RE was about a 1/2 hour appointment and my husband and I both went.  The doctor asked me a lot of questions about my history and my cycles, he did a vaginal ultrasound on me, ordered a bunch of blood tests for me (at various points in my cycle) and gave me instructions and a referral for a HSG (to check if my tubes were blocked).  He also ordered a semen analysis for my husband.<br>  <br>  By the time of my follow up appointment with the RE (about 6 weeks later) I had taken care of all the blood tests, the HSG and the semen analysis and we went over the results and discussed treatment options.<br>  <br>  The most common treatment options depends on what is causing the infertility.  In my case I wasn't ovulating regularly so I was prescribed Clomid which is a fertility drug that helps a woman ovulate.
9a3sNrEqaa	omggggg....kristel im balling my eyes out right now!!!!!! This is soooo saddddd my heart breaks for his family. It makes u feel like holding ur lil tummy and just loving your baby sooooo much. U know? And being so thankful. omggg i can't stop crying!!!|`|quRSZX9xaa	that was amazing!! It truly was a blessing to hear that story! It brings hope! Elliot had great parents!!|`|t3w3cDduaa	That was so touching.  I'm crying as I right this.  I can't put into words how beautiful that was.  Thanks for sharing!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Oh dear.  I can't watch this again.  I watched this on Oprah and I bawled my eyes out then and now I am pregnant and I would cry a river.  Right, trying not to think about it or I'll cry anyways!<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting it for people to watch.|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	That was very touching.  The dad was very courageous for putting that video together.
oRaYQNXxaa	If you are delivering vaginally no they do not shave you. If you are having a c-section they will shave the area that will be cut to open you up.|`|AA12275027	it's up to you what you want.|`|FyFUvnCIaa	No, the doctors do not shave you. They finally found out that either way, it doesn't affect the cleanliness of the baby. Your doctor shouldn't ask you, they used to do that 40 years ago. Good luck and congrats on your soon baby!|`|h0nfy6VXaa	The doctors don't even offer anymore.  Nobody is concerned about it.  It doesn't effect the labor in any way.  I wanted to be nice and trim for my delivery, but shaving was just too hard and I gave up and settled for a trim.  My doctor commented on my 'nice work' but she and I are real close.|`|31Tja0Zvaa	Technically it's up to the woman. You should be able to decide on everything that's going on with your delivery. Anything from positions, music, medication (if or not you want what's suggested), and yes shaving.<br>  <br>  It's up to you.|`|ETvV9aypaa	haha i know its a serious question but i was curious too wen i had my son.. they didnt with me i dont think they do that anymore...|`|273vsUezaa	I don't think it's a big deal to the doctors, unless its a veritable forest down there and the Doc can't concentrate because he's coughing up hairballs.<br>  <br>  Hard to deliver a baby and use an afro pick at the same time y'know|`|NfvMIjJvaa	No they don't shave you any more. it's takes to much time. besides you don't care who's down there or what it looks like when your in labor|`|zevqkFDXaa	I've had 2 babies and they did not shave me either time.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	its up to you
lvBUl3Zdaa	You definitely should never see this guy again. <br>  <br>  Lie to him only if you are sure you can keep him from finding out the truth. You owe him nothing. ∠°)|`|cR1M8ALyaa	If you're big enough for an abortion, then you're big enough to at least tell him the truth. Lying about a miscarriage is ridiculous and I can't understand anyone wanting to lie about something like that.<br>  Then, stop having sex if you can't deal with having a baby.|`|TRrTunqvaa	well.. ok baby daddy is crazy.. now i dont condone the abortion pill at all! but, if you have made up your mind, i will give you the advice to just lie to him about it and say there was a miscarriage. also, know the abortion pill isnt totally safe either.. i hope youve dont your research. <br>  but in my honest opinoin.. dont kill the baby... its not his or her fault.. if theres any way you can give the baby up for adotoption without him being involved... like you dont want him involved.. or maybe just let him adopt the baby, and cut your ties with him that way. yeah its hard, but either way you dont have a baby.. and this way, you give the baby a chance at life.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	Truth is the best<br>  it's not up to him, and also, I doubt he wanted to pay child support for the next 18 years<br>  <br>  dont ever feel guilty or bad for having an abortion!<br>  <br>  I had an abortion and challenge anyone to make me regret it|`|3imLjQlHaa	This is your body. You should tell him the truth... you are in charge of your body and are entitled to do what you need to. He shouldn't be threatening you. Prayers and hugs for you|`|3kydegQJaa	You do what feels right to you.  If you want to have the abortion then do it.  I had a baby while I was in college and I got through it all just fine.  But you know your own life better than I do, so if you feel that you honestly can't be a mom right now, then it's your choice.  Don't let anyone pressure you into anything.  <br>  If he's not even trying to be a dad, and help you raise this baby, then it's none of his business what you do with it.  It's completely irrational of him to try to force you to have it just so it can be raised by his parents, and especially when he wanted you to abort it in the first place.  <br>  If you're really scared of him, then there are things you can do, I don't know what state you're in but where I live you can go to city hall and get an injuction on someone, which is like a restraining order.  I would tell someone that you trust what he's said to you, and maybe they can help figure out what the best route is in your area.  Or you can call your local police stations non-emergency number.  <br>  Do what you want to do, and don't let him affect your decision.  He doesn't have any right to tell you what you can and can't do.  If you do decide to tell him you had a miscarriage, tell him you were as far along as you were whenever you had the abortion.  It'll be easier to remember, and easier to convince him it's true.|`|kbq7qRUCaa	honestly, im not judging you by any means but i believe abortion is wrong. you may want to check into adoption. you can stay in school until you have the baby and then someone will be at the hospital when you have it. also, he is right, it is his child, however, he doesnt have the right to try to tell you how to raise your child.|`|7xsJHSGTaa	make sure you tell people before you do anything. he seems kind of dangerous.<br>  <br>  it is YOUR baby, YOUR body, and YOUR job to make the desisions. NOT his. he shouldnt be involved, even if hes the father.|`|9Sy4Fefdaa	You should probably tell him the truth. In the end,  you have more of a right to make that decision than him.<br>  <br>  Talk to someone close to you, not jackass strangers.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|dE5GOTtAaa	it it best if you tell the truth, and explain why hopefully he is understanding and will listen, if not than idk|`|08zR9MJOaa	Has he told you why he's changed his mind?  If he's in the military, then he needs to understand what it would be like for you to keep it and be going through that without him.  It's good that he feels his mom and stepdad would be supportive but he also can't automatically rely on them, especially if he hasn't talked to them about it first.  I would try to be as honest as you can about it with him, that's really important.  I would also have a discussion with him so he can give you all his reasons for changing his mind and so that you can voice yours.  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck in the situation.  It's a very hard decision to make, especially with two different standpoints.|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Please I know you're entitled to your own opinion but please don't get an abortion, you will regret it for the rest of your life. There's a reason why you initially felt that you didn't want to have an abortion when you found out you were pregnant and I feel as though you only changed your mind because HE wanted you to initially get an abortion, so now you're having doubts about keeping this baby especially since he just all of a sudden made a complete turnaround and told you he wants you to keep the baby. He's obviously causing you alot of emotional stress by going back and forth with this, so I think its making you make irrational decisions on impulse before you're thinking them through.<br>  <br>  If you were so sure that you didn't want to get an abortion to kill that innocent baby then you would just go ahead and do it instead of asking people on yahoo answers about what you should do. Its very evident even if you don't think so that you don't want to get an abortion and that you might want to keep the baby. I believe that deep down in your heart you really want to keep this baby besides the circumstances but right now you're scared and anxious and nervous as hell so you're just blocking everything out and not thinking about all the other options available to you except for one that seems like the easiest way out of your predicament.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that your boyfriend is being serious and that if you do have an abortion you will regret it and have to live with it forever and I doubt that you both will still be together, if and when you have the abortion, this decision will obviously put your relationship at a great risk for it to be on the verge of a breakup. This baby didn't ask for this, the least that you could is give life to it and give the baby up for adoption. <br>  <br>  I highly doubt that he will believe your story of how you supposedly miscarried his baby when you try and cover up your abortion. Especially since you openly told him that since he's changed his mind that you wanted to get an abortion, he will really start to come to conclusions and start asking himself questions, if you're telling the truth or lying. Whether or not you like what I'm saying this will eventually soon enough blow up in your face and you will feel greatly saddened and depressed by your choice to abort it will always be in the back of your mind in your concious. <br>  <br>  No matter what you're choice and stance on your situation is please give it more time to just think things through because it really does sound like your boyfriend really cares and loves the baby and not just you because this baby is a part of both of you. What you really need to do is sit him down alone and talk to him openly about his plans and where he's headed and what your options are regarding the pregnancy and what you want to do about the baby;keep it, give it up, or have an abortion. So that way everything will be laid out on the table and there will be no secrets so go talk to him in a calm and rational way instead of yelling to sort out your problems because you guys, if you work together you can get through this.<br>  <br>  *Please visit this website below I hope and pray it helps you make the right decision. It's not just about you anymore you have your unborn child to think about. It deserves to experience life.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|h0nfy6VXaa	You are very brave for considering confronting this jerkface.  A lot of women would be scared out of their wits by that kind of control.  Go ahead and have the abortion, there's nothing wrong with you wanting the best for yourself.  You don't need to lie.  Your body is your right!  <br>  <br>  If you're scared of him or his family in any way, the abortion clinic will have women there to offer you comfort and options.  Stay strong!<br>  <br>  Just as an added bit of advice, if people are telling you to look into adoption, it isn't worth your suffering.  They say "just stay in school till is born"  They aren't considering all the time you'll need to take off during the last few weeks plus recovery.  Those same jerks will follow you till the day you die saying "why did you give up your baby!  you made your bed, now lay in it!"  Having an abortion will eliminate all of the nasty questions and comments once you start to show.  Either way, according to the jerks who think they can tell you how to live your life, you're going to hell.  Up theirs.|`|wyKYtJ8baa	Whoa crazy. Well he is your ex so he really doesn't have any say in what happens to your body. If you truly believe that you can't raise a baby at this time in your life then you then you should go with your gut instinct.<br>  <br>  It would probably be hard going through the pregnancy while in college so you don't really have the option of giving the baby up for adoption. Has his mum and stepdad offer to raise the baby for you because if they have that's an option? You don't really want to dump the baby on them if they don't want to care for it.<br>  <br>  I think that perhaps you should lie and say you had a miscarriage which is common at early stages of pregnancy but it would be very hard for you to keep this secret I guess. I would probably suggest going to see a doctor and ask for help with what you should do because that's what they are there for.<br>  <br>  Your right about the abortion pill. It's called RU48.<br>  <br>  Goodluck I wish you well with your journey even though it's hard you will eventually get through it.|`|HQgS2P4Baa	if he honestly is scary sometimes to you, YOU don't have to tell him the truth, its your right to do that to your body it is perfectly legal and he cant do anything about it no mater how many people he knows<br>  <br>  but think on the side if he is controlling your opions is it worth it?|`|uZ8mIhJ1aa	Haha you should have never of told him, take the pill tell him you had a miscarrige at 9 weeks|`|B0DWsTkPaa	Well, it's both of your decision but he cant MAKE you do anything. Do what you feel is right for the both of you. And if he "threatens" you, then well that just doesnt sound like a safe relationship. If you can not emotionally, let alone financially and physically go through with it--considering youre the one dealing with it, NOT HIM--then do what feels right. If he has a problem with it, then I suggest getting out of that relationship :) <br>  <br>  Besides, what is he going to do once everything is done?<br>  <br>  Follow your instincts and heart. You'll come to the right decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WQ3omiJUaa	If he is literally a scary person and you don't know how ill-tempered his reaction might be, you may want to tell him you miscarried. Yes, it's horrible to lie, especially about such a profound thing. But he shouldn't have put you in the position where you felt like you had to, by threatening you and trying to control things. It's YOUR body and it seems obvious that you know what's right for you. You don't want to bring a baby into this world to be raised by this guy's parents. Keep it up with college, find a guy that deserves you, and have children then. Let those who pass judgment on you be the least of your concerns. Good luck.|`|zROeEaQxaa	ok, first off FORGET WHAT HE WANTS<br>  what do YOU want to do with this baby?<br>  it's your decision, you're the one that's going to be heaving it out from your insides, not him. so he is the last person to tell you whether or not you should have an abortion. tell him the truth, and yes he does seem a bit dangerous. you should tell a friend or two to look out for you, he seems quite scary. but tell him the truth, he'd be really pissed if you lie to him about a miscarriage. <br>  seriously, i hate when guys try to control girls. if he's going into the marines, he sure as hell can't help you raise the baby. so why pawn the kid off on his parents, they don't want it and neither do you. don't let him scare you into making a huge mistake. <br>  aborting the baby isn't really killing it, because the baby isn't that far along in developing. it hasn't grown enough to even be aware of anything. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck with your decision.
nzrO16L6aa	it could be implantation spotting . they say it happens anywhere from 4 day past ovulataion to 12 days past ovulation and that what it looks like . <br>  <br>  best of luck and baby dust to you !
lGcpXteaaa	It really sounds like your in labour.<br>  When the pain starts time how many seconds it lasts for then time how many minutes there is in between the pains.<br>  <br>  But if i were you i would call your Dr immediately. If it was your waters it should not be brown.<br>  Good luck hun x|`|YnLqItJPaa	If it is your water breaking and you have yellow/green in it, then that's meconium and a sign that you need to get to the hospital ASAP.  It's not terrible or a sign that things are going terribly wrong, so don't panic, but it is an issue that needs to be dealt with right away for the health of mom and baby.<br>  <br>  Go get checked out and good luck!|`|yKS2UI87aa	This is what mine did. I couldn't figure it out cuz it was brown/yellow. I found out later it was b/c he had pooped before he came out. Go to the hospital as they will need to give you antibiotics if it is meconium.<br>  It doesn't always come in one big gush. Good Luck|`|peQGGFPYaa	hunny call your doctor it sounds to me like you are definitely in labor GOOD LUCK!!<br>  in fact maybe head to the hospital and call your doctor on the way unless you want to deliver that baby at home!|`|Drze0cUXaa	start timing your contractions, if they are at least 5 mins apart from one another from the first of 1 to the first of another then it is labor.. the pain will increase so you will know if it is true or false labor.. congrats mama|`|syrh8J6Vaa	The other ladies are correct.  If it is your water the baby may have had its first bowel movement in utero.  Go to the hospital NOW!  Don't think about it just do it!  Good luck hun!|`|knWxRkDTaa	Sounds to me like you may be...count from beginning of the contraction to the beginning of the next one...If your 5 minutes apart go to the hospital...and it has to be exactly 5 minutes...It will be constant....And the gushes may either be the mucus plus, or the water.....Another thing you could do is call your doctor and find out.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and good luck!|`|XrKviWgSaa	you need to head to the hospital and call them on the way telling them whats going on so they can be prepared, you are in labor and that is your water leaking go now|`|UjFgWnfBaa	Congratulations you will be a mama pretty soon!!!|`|R8VhFeEVaa	Yes, those are contractions. Go to a hospital.
kaqPSgTVaa	It could definetly be a multiple pregnancy. The only other way that could happen would be if you ovulated early in your cycle. Really early.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	you get bigger faster with later PG then with the 1st..<br>  <br>  mine showed up exacly on your dates (last year) and the PG test came POS in seconds...<br>  <br>  and i only had 1 baby
K0Oh0p6Daa	Sex usually helps 2 to 3 times a week until the 39th wk.
e2tE6EI8aa	its one of the most amazing experiences...  :]|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It felt like there was popcorn popping in my belly.. lol. That's the best way to explain it.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	For me, I started feeling movement around 16 weeks.  It felt like weak bubbles popping in my abdomen, and at first I dismissed it as gas bubbles.  However, by the end of the week I realized they were actually the baby!<br>  <br>  I'm 18 weeks now, and I feel the described "flutters".  It feels like someone is lightly tapping the inside of me either once or a couple times in a row (very quickly), then stops.  It's a very foreign feeling, and I can't compare it to anything else I've experienced before.  <br>  <br>  I'm enjoying it now.  I probably won't when those light taps become hard kicks! ^.^|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	They feel just like eskimo kisses!  (Remember those as a child... fast beating eyelashes against your cheek!)  They are very light and easy to dismiss.  At first you may think it is just gas or your imagination, but then you realize that it is the little miracle inside you.  <br>  <br>  I have to say it was one of the best aspects of pregnancy.  Later on... they aren't so discreet in their movements!  They feel more like Mohammed Ali than a butterfly!  I will never forget the first time that I realized I could feel them moving!  Very special.  Congrats!|`|oRaYQNXxaa	To me it felt like somebody gently thumping my lower belly. :) I didn't feel her move until about 17 weeks of pregnancy.|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	Strange at first like butterflies in your tummy its amazing|`|h0nfy6VXaa	It feels like driving into a dip in the road.  You get a tickling sensation in your tummy almost like going down a baby roller coaster.|`|oJA7QVOhaa	okay take ur pointer finger and tap ur stomach very lightly a couple times liek that but butterflies cause it is on the inside of ur stomach:)|`|WQ3omiJUaa	It feels like gas, with no pain. It literally feels like a little flutter. You will just know when you feel it.|`|k2ms63v0aa	When I first felt my baby, it was like bubbles were in my stomach, fast and ticklish.  I loved that feeling

1nXLSnJNaa	The most common answer you are going to get is that if you have sex....you can get her pregnant. Regardless of your birth control method or if you pull out....there is always a chance, very slim albeit.....but still a chance.|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	If the condom breaks or has a tear in it then she can become pregnant.|`|Q0WARis0aa	it is a very low chance with a condom on .. but theres always that chance .. hope i could help.. be safe and you wont be sorry ..|`|QGkCFJjPaa	Only if the condom breaks then you can. But other than that your fine|`|af4b3ca140fe99088e88c75eddf2e61faa	if you are wearing a condom then it is unlikely you will get her pregnant. so you dont need to pull out.<br>  and well done for being so careful. you must have a lot of respect for both your girfriend and yourself. i only hope there are more lads out there like you.|`|oltCj6Kcaa	The only 100% sure way not to get pregnant is abstinence. Every other method (including birth control pills) are not 100% effective. Continue using the condoms. Those are your best protection...not only against pregnancy but also STDs.
cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	My mom had one fallopian tube when she had me, she had to have it taken out after my brother caused some damage.  She was told that having the one tube would mean she would be more likely to have a girl i think it took her 6 months to conceive me.  Just keep going, good luck|`|m0vcnArfaa	try pre seed|`|N36YHm7qaa	Be patient is what I have always told our patients in the office.  You ovulate on one side usually switches every month, but we are all different.  I swear by this one, stop talking about it, and don't worry, just relax.  I told one of our patients who was trying so hard to conceive to just have a date night with hubby, keep track of temp spikes, or use the ovulation test etc.  Get a glass of wine some candles and just enjoy making love with your husband.  She was pregnant the next month.  Listen many women get pregnant with one fallopian tube.  Just as many men have babies with one testicle.  35 used to be called high risk, but now is a very common age for women to have children.  Yes as we get older our risk go up, but up until menopause you are still releasing eggs.  So just hang in there and relax, can't prove it medically but gotta say that is when I have seen it happen.  Next phase would be the shots.  Try this method first.  <br>  Best of Luck|`|mx3gFmIKaa	IF you have 1 tube open, this cuts your chances in half.  Suggest making sure that the tube is open, have you considered an HSG test?  Have you had bloodwork to determine your ovaries are still functioning?  FSH test, 10-12 or higher indicates ovarian failure.  My suggestion is to be aggressive, don't wait
fPmN2RQEaa	I had to fake it, as I wasn't ready to have another child yet. <br>  On another note, I still think the moon has everything to do with this.<br>  Put your zip code in this and go to Feeding Times tab.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Ok for some reason the site bigfishtackle.com is not working the way I am use to so some alternatives are. <br>  <br>  When the moon either is coming up in the east or setting in the west this is one-hour bite. Then when the moon is one hour before straight over-head to one hour past directly overhead is 2 hour with it at your feet 12 1/2 hours later is again 2-hour bite.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another is watch called Casio Pathfinder you must know your GMT Greenwich mean time, and longitude & Latitude ordinances to set the watch and must allow for DLS day light savings.<br>  <br>  There is what I call freak days as this occurs five days before the new and full moon for two consecutive days. <br>  See if it is accurate for the times, you both wake up unassisted, eat, fall asleep and get busy.<br>  You will be amassed; but know that I have found there to be a half hour in between each set of times. The minor is good for 1 hour and the major is good for 2 hours being the time shown is the start time.<br>  <br>  Not to gross you out or anything, so on a personal note; we wanted to have a boy so here is what I believe. When we would go at it; I considered the first shot to be the girls as our first-born was a girl and I remember how it went in detail that time. <br>  <br>  So I figured then the second shot must be boys as for me girls on the left and boys on the right so, I would do the deed and pull out then after about 10 min. go again so as to say cleaning house and the second time was the charm. Within 5 weeks, we knew. He is now four years old and I would not have changed a thing. As by following the So-lunar schedule, I could tell when he wanted to eat and fall asleep or when he would wake up. Then we would go fishing every time he say’s he's hungry as first the little ones come in then the big ones then it repeats one more time usually I will catch upwards of 16 fish at a time UFB.<br>  <br>  Of course, you should consult the doctor what is going or try the other. Read through the other site listed and search for others, but use the first one to save you money on a So lunar schedule.|`|H74F8jxuaa	You both need to go see a fertility specialist.  Have you tried charting your cycles becaus you may not be ovulating when you thought.  You have to have sex at least three times during the 5 days leading up to and including ovulation in order to conceive.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Numerous factors come into play here:<br>  How long are your cycles?<br>  Are you ovulating?<br>  What day do you ovulate?<br>  Are you having sex every other day?<br>  Have you and your husband had your hormones tested?<br>  <br>  A normal, fertile couple having sex every month at the right time can take up to a year to get pregnant. If you have any other factors, you should be a dr after 6 months of trying.|`|dgRTkccBaa	If you've been trying for that long you and your husband both need to be tested for fertility problems.  You could both be fine, and it's just dumb luck that you haven't gotten pregnant yet, but nobody on here can tell you why you haven't yet.|`|7fE27hcIaa	Its hard to say  we dont know your medical history,  there are many reasons speak to your doctor|`|8gCe3vRDaa	some times it happen.

01PcKKtiaa	Well my friend started using this as she had PCOS. She swears by it and fell pregnant after about 4 months of usage.<br>  <br>  I found it regulated me but I soon stopped taking it. I then tried acupuncture and using cough medicine to thin my musus out. I even went to the extent of using self hypno tapes to calm me down and relax me. After a month or so of that....I was pregnant after 13 months TTC. <br>  <br>  Good luck x
