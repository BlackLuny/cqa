20070521034527AA6wxtv	Pets;Dogs	Undecended testicle?	I have just had some shocking news from my vet.   After taking my 2 year old German Shepherd dog in to be castrated, I was infromed that he has an undecended testicle and to continue with the operation will now cost me nearly 5 times more than what i was originally going to pay..   I had no reason to know if my dogs testicles were not where they should be, so far he has been heatlthy and not needed vertrinary treatment, so i am now wondering if i should let his breeder know of my  sudden suprise, as she was once a good friend of mine, who believed all of her dogs were of best quality.   The sire of my dog (who is now decesased) also fathered another male and i believe this dog to be normal as he has fathered pups.    Is this just bad luck?

20070702151617AA0IvIL	Pets;Birds	My Birds are Fighting?	I recently got a bird (yellow) and put it with my other bird (gray). The gray bird is always staying on the pirch and eating from the dish. The yellow bird is always going near the gray bird and it pecking at her. I lost my temper at the yellow bird and set him outside the cage with some food and water and a perch for punishment. I wan't to know why the one bird is atacking the other, And how to prevent this.      The yellow bird is a bird who lived alone for most of his life and always gives vicious looks to people who go near him. He lived with other birds a long time ago. The gray bird was the same except she is very yound and was raised with other birds. Help is greatly apprieciated.

But when they think we are not around  the Yorki lets him lick her (virginia) and they get along and at night we don't know if they have sex or not. Now (three weeks later) the Yorki shows abnormal signs, like; fitigue, softer stool (note: we haven't change diet) etc.

A guy from the Humane Society came over yesterday and my mom was home.  He said that our neighbors had complained, because the lady said that when she walked out of her house, she smelled feces coming from our house I guess.     My mom was like!! What?!! He said "he didn't smell anything and saw that we have a little **** zu that is 13 years old.  My mom said that he's usually inside, but he does go to the bathroom outside.  We have huge back yard and he goes in the back of the house.  The neighbors that complained live on the side of the house not the back!!   The guy shook his head and said not to worry about it.  Left his card and said to be in touch with him if we had any problems. My mom also told him that everyone in our neighborhood has at least 1 dog.     Has this happened to anyone else?

20071015180231AA0gUrg	Pets;Dogs	Barking Dog With Nasty Owner Is there a solution?	We have been putting up with our neighbours dog for 12 months now. We have written non threatening letters, advising her of the situation and my husband introduced himself one day, during the course of the conversation he mentioned the dog. She immediately flew at thim with a barrage or foul launguage, got in her car and drove off. We do have a dog of our own that rarely barks, bout the only thing that gets him going is a thunder storm. Trouble is; We can't stand on our decking out back and talk as it hears us and just barks, if someone stops a car outside of our house it barks. It barks for everything and at everybody and can go for hours. Why can't people work with you to find a resoloution.... Why so defensive. What would you do.

Encore à l'instant, un gosse est mort de morsure de chien. La SPA a fait savoir que le "ma?tre" ne s'en occupait pas : le chien était victime de dénutrition.    Par ailleurs, ce chien appartenait à un vigile.       Pour être vigile, il faut être propriétaire d'un chien. Pas d'un caniche, non non, d'un chien si possible impressionnant.    Alors pourquoi vouloir impressionner avec un chien ?? quel est le but de cette manoeuvre ??    Montrer aux personnes indélicates qu'elles s'exposent le cas échéant à être menacée par un vigile "armé" d'un chien. En l'espèce, le chien est bien une arme par destination.       Ensuite, le gouvernement demande au parlement de voter une lois contre les chiens dangereux.       N'y-a-t-il pas, comme nous le connaissons si bien en France, deux poids deux mesures ?

20080926045041AAhEqpV	Pets;Dogs	Its 6:30 am and the dogs have destroyed all hopes of ever having a toy that lasts...any tips?	Sorry its early I hope I make since.....      Okay its 6:30 and i'm up extremely early, I do not mean to be. But since I'm up I'm up I got the dogs out. Well we ran out of chew bones last night and this morning they destroyed our last hope of them every having a toy that can last in this house. They had a very sturdy ball that was made out of rope and it lasted awhile, and they had a pull rope that lasted awhile. Those were the only toys they'd play with that they hadn't destroyed. Well last night Sasha decided to rip apart the rope ball and eat the string and this morning she decided to pull apart the rope and again in the string.      Will I ever find a toy that can withstand them. Zack used to be real good with plush toys but Sasha taught him to rip them apart. And they wont touch hard rubber toys. They don't care for the nylabones either.      So here I am with nothing to give them to keep them occupied and I currently can't go out and get them anything due to my current medicine (I'm sick right now and can't drive with my medicine)      How can I keep them entertained with being unable to do anything with them and them destroying all their toys?      Is there any makeshift things I can give them that would be safe, like water bottles or something (ofcourse I'm scared they'd eat that.) They are getting restless and want to fight with each other.      Can't really go out and walk them right now either. Just have to wait for my husband to get home at 5pm      Its going to be a long day.         SO WHAT TOYS WILL WORK AND WHAT CAN I DO UNTIL I CAN GET THEM SOME TONIGHT?      (They hate the hard rubber toys and won't play with them)

20090227023740AADhgmE	Pets;Cats	My cat's behaviour is out of control?	I have 2 cats (almost 1 year old so in between cat and kitten).  They are seriously out of control in their behaviour and they are really stressing me out.  They are indoor cats with lots of toys and and scratching posts and my husband and I give them lots of attention.  Half the day they are the most beautiful things, very affectionate and sweet, the other half (after they've woken up from sleeping) they are terrors.  They charge around the house, knocking things over, breaking things, climbing all over the benches, scratching the carpets up, fighting (they're both boys and they've both been 'done').  One constantly meows and jumps up on everything and anything causing all sorts of mess, the other can't grasp the litter tray - he knows how to use it and does half the time, but is generally lazy and will wee and poo on the floor a lot (we have 3 litter trays and they get cleaned regularly).       I love them and wouldn't ever think of getting rid of them, but I need to know how to control them - they are seriously non-stop for hours.  I am pregnant and they really stress me out!  Thanks
20090503070032AAzi6nj	Pets;Dogs	My mom wont let me get a dog.?	In March 2009 she promised me a puppy for my 16th birthday.   She bought all the bowls, bed, blanket, etc.   It's now May, & i still don't have a puppy.   The reasons as to why i don't have one is because;      one; i'm applying for college and i'll be living in a dorm, so i'll only see my puppy on weekends.   two; she doesn't know what to do with it when we go away, as in, she doesn't want to pay to leave it somewhere.   three; if i don't go to college, i'll be moving to venezuela. But i'll obviously take it with me.      Is there anyway i can convince her that these reasons don't matter.   I can't think of any possible free & guaranteed way to leave it behind for a few weeks.      Please help.
20081001132839AA9mvg5	Pets;Dogs	Help with puppy biting behavior and tearing up carpets ?	Alright. My puppy is a 10 week old chihuahua/doxen/sheltie mix. He didn't have a biting problem until he was with a couple for a couple of weeks (from about 5 to 7 weeks, he was going to live with them but they couldn't keep him). None of his litter mates bite humans much (they all went to different members of the family so I see them often), but he bites very hard. The one guy he was with was training him to bite very very hard for playing, and I am not sure how to undo this learned behavior. When he bites me i've been very firmly but calmly saying "No bites" and slowly withdrawing my hand, or foot, or whatever. And then i've tried to stick something in his mouth he can chew on (a rawhide stick or tug-of-war toy). This has greatly helped. But he still bites way too much and too hard, particularly toes and ankles when he gets over-excited. I remain patient with him, but I was wondering if anyone had ideas of how to correct this behavior quicker, because other people in my house are getting very upset about it.       Secondly, I was wondering if anyone knows anyway to discourage a puppy from tearing up the carpet (maybe something that smells or tastes bitter to him? I know products are sold commercially for that purpose, but I won't be able to go to the store for several days). It's only one spot he has decided to rip up.

20080303192354AAowsiM	Pets;Dogs	Why is my adult dog pooping indoors?	My fiance and I have a 3 1/2 year old female pug. Lately she has been pooping on the floor when we are not home. Her diet has never changed, nothing has changed in the household, she gets brought out with our other dog at least 3 times a day. Most of the time she has to be coerced into going when we take her outside. She normally does a u-turn for the door instead of doing her thing. Lately, within the last month, we will come home from work, shopping, or the gym, and she will have that "guilty" look on her face. Sure enough, she has pooped inside. It is not the other dog, he goes no problem. You can tell it is her. We have scolded her, but yet, she continues to do it. There will be times that we can tell (it looks like her number 2 is crowning), but she will not do it outside. Any suggestions?      Oh yeah, any stupid, non constructive answers will be flagged.

20080705001134AA5JF6r	Pets;Birds	What sex are my cockatiels?	hello      i bought two cockatiels, supposedly male and female when they were 12 weeks of age. the male (oriel) displays normal male behaviour: beak banging, heart shaped wings, and he's very vocal. whereas the female (pipi) is docile, gentle and very quiet.      however, since i've had them for about a year, and they've moulted, i read up on visual sexing: and from my understanding it would appear they're both females.    They both have barring under their tails and they both have spots on the underside of their wings. Oriel however has them on both primary and secondary feathers, whereas Pipi only has them on the long feathers further away from her body. She posses a gray face with a dull orange cheek patch, and oriel has a bright orange cheek patch. I'm confused because some sources are contradictory. Faces indicate differing sexes and some people say primary and secondary feather spotting mean different sexes as well. behaviour indicates i have a male and female, yet both have barred tails.

Eine Freundin von mir hat vor 2 Jahren in Heimarbeit Steppbetten angefertigt, mit reinem Baumwollbezug und echten Daunen und in einer alten, sogenannten "M?gdekiste" (Eichenholz) aufbewahrt. Ein Schock gestern Abend, es haben sich leider Motten eingenistet und L?cher in die Bezüge gefressen. Na klar kann man die ersetzen, aber wer schon mal mit Motten zu tun hatte, kennt auch die Brut und die Abf?lle. Gibt es eine M?glichkeit die Daunen zu erhalten zu reinigen und die Motten inklusive Brut zu vernichten? Es w?re doch einfach schade um die vielen Stunden Arbeit und das Material!

20070620230432AALhWfD	Pets;Dogs	I have always wondered about this.........?	i have 2 dogs a terrier mix (1 and 3 months old) and a german shepherd/rottie mix (7 months old) they r both very loyal smart and sweet natured and happy dogs but my gsp/rottie mix is still a puppy so can she become aggresive as an adult cuz i heard puppies change attitude when they grow up    oh and my gsp/rottie mix is afraid of my dad (he nvr hits her) but we adopted her from an animal shelter 4 months ago and the lady who worked there told me that she was really thin when she found her on the freeway and resucued her, when we brought her home that day she seemed 2 afraid of my dad and she still is,    but back 2 the main point can my dogs become aggresive  when they get older even if they r sweet natured loyal dogs right now??
20081007154410AADevkV	Pets;Cats	Is it ok to leave two cats by theirselves for 4 days?	This is what happened, last time I boarded them they refused to eat, got skinny and were terribly home sick. I just moved to a new area so nobody to rely on to come feed them or say hi, anyhow I had a friend come once in my former place and the cats just hid under the bed as soon as she came in. I do not want to worry about them not eating at the kennel and refusing to move. So do you think they would be ok alone with an auto feeder and auto waterer and window views and free access to the whole house?  I would be leaving on a monday afternoon and returning on a friday morning.

20081007215003AASNqIR	Pets;Cats	Why won't my cat use his litter box?	I have two cats, one that's about 3 years old, and I've had for about a year.  The last few weeks, he keeps going outside his litter box, near it,but not in it.  My younger cat recently picked up on scratching things, including the litter box, as if to mark her territory.  Plus, I shampood the carpet, and changed their litter.  At first I thought he was sick, but he's acting normal, other than this.  Then I thought maybe he couldn't get into the covered box, so I got him his own.  he still won't use it, I keep finding it right outside the box.  He never had a problem sharing it before, but I'm wondering if now that the baby cat is bigger, he doesn't want to share.  She's younger and smaller, but the little one is definitley the dominant kitty.      Please don't say "take him to the vet".  I'm trying to get an idea of what might be wrong BEFORE I bring him, so I don't blow a bunch of money I don't have on tests that are useless. 
20080504171423AAWEMb4	Pets;Dogs	Another puppy training question?	Ok, so my 10 week old GSD/Rottie cross growled at my mom and took a defensive stance when she approached his food.  He's never done this before, and since we got him, we've been trying to pet him and get him used to having people around his food.  Also, when I reached down to pick him up, he growled and reached his head up to bite my chin.  I want him to know whos boss, and also, whats the best way to train a rottweiler? We're taking him to obedience classes, but he doesnt seem to respnd well to the word 'no' and I just dont want to raise him wrong so he gets the wrong idea about who is boss.  Thanks again!!

20070822100140AAAFyiW	Pets;Dogs	What defines a smart dog?	Someone I know says that their dog was really smart because it didn't jump all over people and wasn't entertained by simple things like a "stupid" dog. In other words, it was more sophisticated.      I highly disagree. I think a dog that is interactive is a smart dog. I think a dog who chases a ball is more intelligent than a dog that ignores it. My dog doesn't chase a ball and so I've always thought of her as kind of dull.      I think dogs don't have the capability to be "sophisticated". It's intelligence potential isn't the same as that of a human, so they shouldn't be measured on the same scale.      A more responsive dog is the more cognitively stimulated -- and therefore, smarter -- dog.      What do you think?

20090305060048AAgqW7s	Pets;Dogs	Advice please - work colleague leaves his dog in his car all day!!?	I got back from my lunch break and saw a little Jack Russel in one of the cars in the private staff car park at the place I work.  One of the windows was left slightly open - and I live in Wales (UK) so the weather at the moment is not scorching.     I came into my office and asked around and was told that the guy in question is someone who works in a different section from me (I dont even know what he looks like) and that he leaves his dog in the car every day all day (from 8am - 5pm).  They said that he doesn't always let the dog out at lunch - sometimes it gets left in there all day.      I think this is outrageously cruel - and wondered if anyone could offer me any advice on what i could do to stop him from doing it in future?  I feel a bit uncomfortable talking to him as I dont know the guy - but I am parked next to him today and was wondering if I should say something when we leave work?        If you think that I am in the right to want to do something about this - can you give me any suggestions on what to say to him (I dont want to put him on the defensive or start out too negatively) and does anyone know what legal repercussions/outcomes could happen - Ie: if i was too contact the RSPC what could/would they do?      Thanks guys.      PS -  I think anyone that leaves their dogs in cars should be locked up.  Our German Shepherd will get left with all windows open slightly for a maximum of a couple of mins if we have to pop into a garage/shop etc.  Even that only happens rarely - more often than not one of us stays in the car with her,

Okay, I have some questions to ask about cold water fish.I just got them today and I really don't know how to take care of them so I'm gonna ask a few questions.They aren't gold fish but around that size.They have white on their stomachs and their tails go into two ani thinkd then split into four.They are orange, and about 2 inchs both of them.I think they are very pretty......      How much water do you need for 2 fish?   How much food do you give per fish?   When do you feed fish?   When do you clean out a fish tank?   What type of rocks are good for fish tanks?   What do you feed fish? (I know food but flakes or pellets)   Do you need to have a plant for them to survive?   What does it mean if my fish stay at the bottom of them tank?   How can you tell if your fish are sick?   I don't have a lid on my fish bowl so does it mean that my fish don't have to come up to the surface?   I have never seen them come up for air does that mean they're gonna die?      One of my major problems is that they don't come up for air.Is that because I don't have a lid on it so they can aready get the air?And for your information it's afish bowl 17cm wide I can change if I want to.

20090227031552AAtnEfL	Pets;Dogs	Is it NORMAL for a PREGNANT DOG to...?	This pregnant dog has just delivered 4 puppies. One every hour. I have called the vet after it has been 4 hours since the last pup has been delivered with no signs of another pup coming and they said based on the dam not contracting or being uncomfortable, that she is done delivering. So we have a total of 4 pups.      Well my question is, is it normal for a dam who just had a litter, to be expelling a brown/dark reddish liquid from her vagina? when the liquid dries its looks like dried up brownish/red blood.      and also is it normal for a dam who just dropped a litter to be panting lightly? I am not sure if she is just breathing a little harder because she is nursing and just got done with labor and if its just because its warm in the room for the puppies. So is it normal for a just out of labor dam normal to be breathing a little harder than normal?      I don't see or feel any puppy trying to come out and the dam is not contracting at all, even though we gave her calcium and feathered her just in case. And doesn't appear uncomfortable as if she still has something in her stomach. So the vet said she seems to be done delivering. But I am not sure about the panting. She still pants a little but not much as before she was in labor. So is it normal for a dam to pant after delivering?      Right now it has been 12 hours since the last pup has been delivered, and the dam is still panting lightly and every once in awhile she discharges the liquid. So is it normal for the dam to still be panting?
20090227025953AA6EM8F	Pets;Dogs	Ear infection in 2yr old boston terrier.?	Went to the vet and got a bottle of ear drops for my puppy now either she had two different kind of ear infections or this one didn't work she has an appointment for monday. (currently friday) I did the full treatment its been 2 weeks but the smell hasn't stopped I've also been giving her baby aspirins every 6hrs (the vet said its okay).      My question is, is it possible to have two different kinds of ear infections or was this medicine just not the right stuff. Its suppose to be a type of yeast infection.       Would the natural cures I've seen online be worth trying since I've been told its yeast? Or should I just keep giving her aspirins until Monday. I don't think its a good idea to continue giving her aspirin but I don't want to see her in pain and about 20 minutes after the aspirin she seems fine.       Would cleaning her ears daily with water and peroxide be okay until Monday. I've been cleaning them daily with some wipes I got from Petco and the other ear is nice and clean but the infected ear doesn't look or smell any better.

She is on Amitriptyline already but it hasn't stopped, actually worse. She startles and then the pacing starts.  There are no nighttime critters.  Only significant thing was that she had teeth removed under anesthesia, but was fine after wards for a week, then this started.  Only other thing is my father died, but he never really had anything to do with my animals.Vet is aware and only increased the medication.I do recognize she is sick.  I am leaning more towards a possible stroke or hypoxia type illness, but am majorly unsure.  She won't even settle on a leash near us or on bed.  Any thoughts out there.  If nothing helps we'll have to put her down.

20090227032121AAaJDuK	Pets;Cats	My Cat bit a possum!! Is she ok?!?	My husband stepped outside to smoke a cigarette (too early in the morning) and there were some possums going to town on a bag of trash we shouldn't have left outside our apartment door- (wont happen again). So the possums run into our apartment and my husband starts to try to get them out. He came back to bed thinking they were all gone- and he heard another one in our son's room (thankfully he'd already joined us in our bed...so he wasn't in danger).      So he got the last one out and our cat (less than 1 year female) was under the bed frightened. My husband said that she had blood on her face and neck- he washed her face and neck - but there are no wounds. So i'm guessing she bit the possum (they were white)...      is she ok? could she get rabbies from bitting the possum?

20080315132632AAauRqa	Pets;Dogs	My dog (babygirl) died Sunday,What happened?	I had a 3 Year old Rottweiler names SISSY who was Happy and Healthly no Heartworms or anything.One day I let her out and Chancey her Sister to run like they always do and Both of them that night would not eat there food.The next morning I went to feed them still did not eat.So I brought them both in thinking ok they probably got a bug or somthing.They Both stayed in the house for 4 days.2 days pass and Chancey finally ate and back to good Health.Sissy looked ok no Fever or anything so I decided to go get Pedialight for her and she did wag her Tail and was Alert her last days.I took her outside to urinate and she Collapsed outside in it.I rushed her to the Vets office and her Organs were shutting down and there was nothing to do about it.I am still looking for the Cause why that Happened as if she had gotten into Poison which there is none around. I miss her and still am crying over her as it is so hard when you lose a member of the family.

20090305074551AAocVhS	Pets;Dogs	Euthanasia in dogs (or cats)?	I must preface this question with: I'm doing an essay on this subject and would like varying viewpoints to help me put together the "public opinion" part of the essay.  I appreciate all answers.      Moral dilemma of euthanasia in dogs (or cats) when not medically necessary:   Is it acceptable for an owner (not the shelter or pound) to euthanize a dog (or cat for that matter) simply because it is not wanted?  Although it could be adopted out, there could be perceived pitfalls to that as well -- will the dog be treated well by the new owners, how does the owner giving it up know the dog will be happy or have a good life?        I was told by one person that her dog was so attached to her family that she didn't think it would bond with or be happy with anyone else, even though it was very young -- she was concerned he would be afraid and confused and unhappy if given to a rescue group where it would be fostered or to a new family.  Her dog was loved and wanted and she had no plans to do anything but keep him, but strictly as an opinion on this subject, she said she could understand the viewpoint that it wouldn't be fair to subject a dog like that to such new and different surroundings where it might be miserable for the rest of its life.        The main question to be addressed in my essay is:  "Is the mindset that it is better to euthanize an animal rather than possibly subjecting it to an unhappy or abused life a valid one?"         Any thoughts would be appreciated.      Thanks!
20090305070404AAQtLHu	Pets;Dogs	Woman just threatened to kill my 14 month GSD?	i was outside on my front porch and my puppy gets excited when he sees another dog. and he started barking and the one lady had a black dog, i think it was a pitbull mix, it was black and really slim thin. and she's like "your dog better not come over here or i'll kill it, i'll let my dog loose to kill it." I didn't know what to say, then she said, she saw my dog loose and running after people! WHICH CLEARLY HE DIDN'T! i know she's confusing Thunder with Angel, the other GSD.  I want to confront her, but without my dog of course. I don't know what to do. i don't appreciate people threatening me to kill my do. i'm pretty sure, her as a dog owner wouldn't appreciate someone threatening to kill her dog either. I'm not letting this go, so what should i do?

And right now she is poking me and she is meowing nonstop, she just jumped up on my lap and shes purring.      I don't know what she wants! I gave her food and water, I tried playing with her and I tried snuggling with her, but she's been like this all morning! Is she just hyper? Wants attention? What is her deal?

20090305072525AAEqrYu	Pets;Horses	Will my riding progress this way still?	Okay, so my trainer broke her leg, and can't train me as often. But since she can't ride all of the horses, I'm now riding two horses, Tazz and Aspen.      I've been training Tazz to jump. And so far, we're doing eight jump courses and he changes his leads well. So it's going good.      Aspen has already gone through extensive training. He used to jump about four foot and won many shows. He has over 1,000 show points. I don't jump him that high, though. Because just recently did I get good enough to ride him (he's a VERY hard horse to ride. You have to be strong to keep him going, and he spooks really bad). I'm just helping my trainer get him back in shape, he hadn't been ridden in about six months.      So I'm currently jumping the horses about 2'9... which I know isn't very high.      But will I progress fast enough this way? The reason why I'm worrying is because I'm already 15, and I want to be able to get into a riding college after I get my requirements out of the way (so I will be about 20). Do you think I will be ready?      Thank you so much.

20090305063641AAJCDab	Pets;Fish	Advice on Heater heartache!!?	Well I am trying to set up a 5 gallon tank (probably will have one Betta in there) and my filter is up and running, but I am having such a hard time with my heater! I have bought two and neither of them seem to be working! They just don't heat up the water past 72 degrees or so! I tried to test the first one again last night and it didn't heat up the water very much (if any), but when I took it out and touched it, it nearly burned my finger !(I had it set on 85). This is just the weirdest thing. Should I warm the heater up before putting it in the water or what am I doing wrong! I would love to start cycling my tank soon, but I would like the heater to be working first. I have one of the old style mercury thermometers which I have tested and it is working. Thanks for your advice!

20090305064747AAJxvcJ	Pets;Fish	Platy rare sickness problem?	I have had my tank a good six weeks. I have slowly added Platys over said time. It is a 5 gallon tank with 4 platys and 2 dwarf platys. Up until last week all of my fish have been doing wonderfully!      I noticed that one of my red wags has been hiding to catch some zzzzs at very odd times. She is usually the one who out and about interacting with me. Two days after that I noticed ich on my sunburst wag so I treated the tank with copious amounts of salt and a bit of Quick Cure. Today the ich spots are gone but my one sleepy red wag had now begun to swim erratically from time to time. She has not been eating and is constantly scratching. I have been reading up on her symptoms in my roommates fish books (we both keep live breeders) and the only thing that slightly matched my red wags symptoms was internal fungus....       *is there a better explanation for what is going on?   *can I help my fish a.k.a. is it treatable?   *if so what do I do?      Thank you in advance for your help.

I'm getting a puppy, 4 months old, she's a lab and Siberian husky mix.I know that it's hard to determine things about mixed breeds, but I was just wondering what other people think about how she will be as an adult in terms of size and appearance.Right now, I've only seen a picture of her, but she looks rather small to be a mix of two pretty big-sized dogs.Do you think she will grow to be pretty large regardless? Also, she has mostly husky features, fluffy fur, pointed nose and ears, but she is entirely brown, like a lab.Any guesses on either of these things? P.S. I'll add a picture soon..

20090305065142AAuL2PM	Pets;Fish	How to properly use gravel vacuum?	I have a gravel vacuum to clean my aquariums gravel once every week, but can't seem to get the hang of it. Last time I tried to clean the gravel, by the time i'd already gotten 25 % water out using the vacuum it still wasn't sucking anything up so I couldn't get the stuff out of the gravel. Is there a certain way I should be doing it or does it just take time to get the hang of it?    Also, I do the 25% water change with the gravel vacuum every saturday. But since last saturday I was only successful in changing the water, but not cleaning the gravel, would it be okay to do it today or wait till saturday? I've changed 10% of the water on monday and wednesday this week to keep the ammonia level down. But I do that every week, changing ten percent every monday and wednesday and on saturday do a 25% water change with gravel vacuum. I just don't want to be changing it too much to where it would harm the fish.
20090305073527AAfprmE	Pets;Dogs	Should I tell my landlord at my apartment complex about my dog having puppies?	So I just moved into an apartment about 2 months ago and adopted a dog since I was so excited about being able to finally have a dog of my own. Unknown to us we adopted a dog who was already pregnant and to make a long story short just found out two days ago that she wasn't going into heat and was pregnant with about 10 to 11 puppies and was due in about a weeks time. So spaying her and aborting the puppies just wasn't sounding like a good idea since the vet said it was a higher risk procedure and i've read it's very risky and possible to lose the mother in the process as well. Obviously we can't keep any of the puppies and are planning on adopting them out to people or taking them to no kill shelters that will take them.      Now my main question. Should I tell the landlord about the situation or should I not. The puppies can be weaned at 6 to 8 weeks of age and that would be around the time i would start adopting them out and getting rid of them.
20090305065116AAzxq2i	Pets;Cats	Is this something for the RSPCA?	Last week i got a siamese kitten i was told he was vaccinated and 9 weeks old.   When i arrived to pick him up i thought he was very small, but the person assured me that it was because he was hand reared since his mum died.   I also noticed he had gunk around his eyes.   His dad looked sick he had eyes that were crusted shut and sores down his back.   The house smelt like urine and the owner had god knows how many dogs locked in the kitchen.   The dad and another cat where confined to the stairs and weren't allowed in any other room.      I took him to the vet, the next day and the vet told me he was 4 weeks old and had cat flu.      I demanded to take the cat back, but she wouldn't have any of it   After alot of arguing she agreed to take the kitten back.   I spent ￡50 in vet fee's just getting the kitten seen to.   The woman/owner told me i obviously didn't care about the kitten.      So i took the kitten back, and they said it would no longer be up for sale since it was sick.   But my friend messaged her about the advert and she said it was still for sale and in good health.   She wants ￡300 for this kitten that could infect other cats.      What do i do?   The conditions of the house were worrying.

He's in elderly condition - he sleeps all day and night and the only reason he's gotten out of his bed for the past year is to use the pee pad, eat dinner, eat treats or steal toys from his Golden Retriever brother. It sounds like he's very active but really he's only out of his bed for about 20 minutes a day, but when he's out he goes full force. When he sleeps he is also full force.       If he can't walk, he's really lost his reason for living...is it 'time' for my dog to go?

20090305072332AAkP56R	Pets;Rodents	A quick question about my little ratties...?	I got two rats from Petsmart last Tuesday. (And I know, I know. I should have found a breeder..but there aren't many in rural Georgia..)   One is a dumbo rat and the other is a fancy rat.      The dumbo is a good bit older than the other, both are females. I held both at the store for a good period of time. The dumbo was very friendly, very outgoing, she was the one I had picked out first. The fancy rat was very skiddish and scared, but very sweet.      But now that I've had them for a week they've completely changed dispositions. The fancy rat has totally warmed up to me, she'll sit on my shoulder, let me hold her, she's amazing.   But the dumbo is freaked out. I'm trying to be patient, but it's so frustrating. Every time I try to hold her she freaks out and poops on me. And she tenses up and scratches me pretty badly. I try to treat her, like everyone's told me to, when she'll let me hold her, but she won't even eat while I'm holding her.    I know it's going to take some time, but I'm afraid with her being a little older that she'll never GET adjusted. And while I really do love her, I hate the idea of her getting depressed or something because I can't play with her like I'd like..      And advice?

20090305074133AAqztOp	Pets;Dogs	Dog Pregnant estimated whelp date is 6 days away... will she go early? Please no rude answers!?	I breed and raise German Shepherds for Active military, law enforcement, veterans... etc. I've had litters before but this is a first litter from the specific dam.  All puppies have homes and I have a waiting list for those of you who feel the need to comment about breeding.  Anyway, the dam started nesting about two weeks ago which is kind of early.  She has been vomiting all morning and her abdomen has been enlarged for the past four weeks.  The vet estimates a litter of 12 puppies.  I've squeezed her nipples a few times and no milk but she does cry when they are squeezed.  The nipples are full but no milk has been leaked. My vet is on call in case something does happen but based on this do you guys think she'll go early.  I want to be prepared and home if this is the case.  No this is not my first litter just the first with her.
20090305074843AAhiOPz	Pets;Birds	My Lovebird has layed 2 eggs.?	My Lovebird layed two eggs, one yesterday, and one today. There is a male in the cage and this is the first clutch she has layed. She is two years old. I think there may be another egg or two to come as she had that bulge under her. She has a nesting box in her cage and both the male and female go in it. She takes a lot of nestinf material into the box even though she has already layed the eggs, is this normal? The male and female groom each other a lot. Please don't tell me they are not male and female as i know for sure they are as i have DNA tested them. If they are fertile, will they hatch around 20 - 25 day from now? Thanks for any help! Jazzy

I have a 6 month old male guinea pig and before this he was alone. i then got a month old baby male as his companion. at first i had them introduced slowly, by scent and by vision by putting their cages next to each other.      i then had the both of them meet in an open space, and after trying twice it seemed ok.   now that i have them both in the same cage, the older one looks like he is bullying the younger one. he still keep trying to mount the baby, and chases him away from areas in the cage.   there are still heavy sound of purring ongoing with lots of butt sniffing and chasing around.      what can i do?
20090305080951AAwqyjQ	Pets;Dogs	My dog barks constantly when i'm not home?	We have a 2 year old beagle who barks almost constantly when someone is not with him. We've had to crate him overnight due to the neighbors complaining and we get up early to let him outside for the day. However, almost as soon as he gets out he goes into a barking fit. He barks at the neighbors dogs, birds, and sometimes just sits in the middle of the yard and barks. He NEVER barks when we are with him and as soon as he sees us at the door or window to tell him to stop, he stops. When we go away from the window or door for a long period, it inevitably starts again. I work the night shift and am gone from 1:30 pm to 12:30 am 5 days a week and even I feel sorry for my neighbors during the day. We moved out of our apartment and into a house with a yard for this dog but believe it or not, we didn't have any problems with barking until we moved into the house! What should I do? I feel sorry crating him all day AND all night and he doesn't respond to no bark collars or spray and also does not bark when I'm around to "catch him in the act". He is not bored, we have another beagle puppy who has never let out a bark in her life and is also very afraid of our adult dog's barking.

20090305081545AA0u2Xx	Pets;Dogs	Do you agree or disagree with vets doing a spy on a ***** who is brought in for a C-section?	I have a friend who show poms and this pass weekend one of her girls went in to labor ((this was her second litter the first one had no problems)) the girl had the first puppy fine but the second pup was coming but first and got stuck in the birth canal. So she took her to the vets for a c-section, it was normal hours for the office. She used a vet that was close to her house for the first time instead of driving the hour to her normal vet( she just moved). Well the vet did the C-section and spayed her- without the owners consent.       This was a show dog who had just been finished out in the show ring.    It was a problem with the mother- the pup had turned during labor and got stuck( the x-rays took a week before said she should have been able to pass them and they were turned in the right direction.)   The mother wasn't stressed, her owner decied to bring her in before things did go bad.      I dont think its right to do any unnecessary surgery with out the owners permission.   I have heard of this happening to others. Is this a new trend among vets or something?

I don't even know if i want kids, i'm very content with what i have now.      What are your thoughts and opinions?      I see with the current recession we're in people are surrendering their pets to the local shelters because they can on longer care for them. I'm fortunate enough that this situation isn't something i've had to deal with *yet* (and i pray i never do) but i can honestly say if i had to live on canned soup and kraft dinner until things got better and i could afford food for myself.. i would absolutely keep my children.. whatever the cost was.. I couldn't surrender them. I would find a way!      What do you think? what would you do? what would be the last straw for you?

20090305081431AAgBJ4i	Pets;Reptiles	HELP ME PLEASE RIGHT NOW?	Senator Bill Nelson of Florida has Proposed a FEDERAL BAN on ALL  Pythons. S373 is a Very Simple Bill that calls for no Appropriations (funding). That makes it Dangerous because it would be so easy to pass without any real consideration. We must take Action NOW to try and STOP this Bill from passing as written.   What it is:   S373 is a Federal Ban that would effect ALL pythons in EVERY State.    This Bill is an effort to bypass the established process of 'Rule Change' to the Injurious Wildlife List of the Lacey Act that was initiated by the South Florida Water Management District last year. This process is moving into it's second year and is ongoing. USARK warned last April at the 'Herp Summit' in Chicago that a political move was afoot to go around the normal 'Rule Change' process. Although ridiculed by some as "Not Possible", S373 proves that prediction true.   This is an issue regarding Burmese Pythons living feral in South Florida. No other species. No where else. Other pythons have nothing to do with feral populations of Burmese Pythons in South Florida.   S373 has been moved into the Water & Wildlife Sub- Committee. It will be heard there and if given a favorable rating move back to the full Environment & Public Works Committee. (see contact info below)   What it isn't:   This is NOT HR669 the other Federal Bill that we have been campaigning against.    There is NO Scientific Evidence to support the premise that passing S373 will have any impact whatsoever on the Burmese Python situation that is confined to the Southern tip of Florida.   There is absolutely NO Evidence of any kind to support that this is a problem anywhere outside of South Florida.   What USARK is doing:   USARK is working with Scientists on the ground in South Florida and throughout the SE to understand the real dynamics of what has occurred with the Burmese Python. Not the hype but the Hard Facts. During their annual conference South Eastern Partners in Amphibian & Reptile Conservation (SE PARC) established an Invasive Species Task Force to look into these questions. ALL of the Best Minds on the Subject from all the top universities and government agencies were on hand. Dr. Warren Booth, PhD Invasive Species Biologist & Andrew Wyatt, both of USARK, played a leadership role in the formation of the Task Force.   Shawn Heflick is leading USARK's participation in a PBS Documentary arranged by Tom Crutchfield/ Shawn Heflick and Hosted by Nigel Marven to publicize the truth behind the Burmese Python & other potential Invasive Herps in South Florida.   USARK is not only working chest deep in the Everglades, but we are actively working to influence key personnel in the US House and Senate, as well as the National Park Service and the US Fish & Wildlife Service. From the Everglades to Washington DC we are working hard on behalf of our community and industry to assure that if any legislation is passed, it will be fair and in the best interests of the Herp Community. We have No other conflicting allegiances.   USARK has introduced State Legislation including Non- Release & Escape Prevention provisions providing safety measures at the State level.   What Can You Do Today to STOP S373?   Join USARK's Reptile Nation!There is Strength in Numbers... Protect Your Rights!   Call, write, email & fax the Sponsor and the Sub-Committee for S373. (contact info & sample letter below)   Be Polite & Professional. If you can't do this don't bother because it will damage our efforts.   ***Forward this to everyone on your email list, post it on every forum/ social networking site.   When you have finished with the steps above, send an email to senate373@yahoo.com with 'No on S373' in the Subject Line so that USARK can track the number of responses.   Sample Letter (cut & paste):   Subject: NO on S373   I oppose S373 as written. The Burmese Python issue is a South Florida issue not a National one. There is No credible evidence to show that these animals can exist north of Lake Okeechobee. Many different species of Pythons have been imported into the US over the last 50 years. The only pythons that have been established have been Burmese Pythons, but only in South Florida; no where else. No evidence exists anywhere to suggest that Banning all Pythons will have any positive impact on the effected area in the southern tip of Florida.    Banning all pythons nationwide would have a devastating effect on an already troubled economy. It would destroy thousands of hardworking American families and small businesses. Not just the breeders and dealers but hobbyists, dry goods, equipment manufacturers, food providers, shippers, trade shows, hotels and restaurants. To overlook the crushing blow this would have to an entire segment of the economy is irresponsible.   (add what S373 would mean to you and your family)   Sincerely,   (signature line)       Contacts:   Senator Bill Nelson    716 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC 20510   Phone: 202-224-5274   Fax: 202-228-2183     http://billnelson.senate
