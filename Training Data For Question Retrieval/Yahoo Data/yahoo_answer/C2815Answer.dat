UppsoSZPaa	The words "cheap" & "Las Vegas" don't usually go in the same sentence! Good luck! Please let me know if you find something, I'll be there next month & could use a nice inexpensive place to eat.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Well if you look at an online yellow pages you can find a ton of places to eat in Vegas! Most of the places there are located in the hotels on the strip which can be a bit pricey. Some hotels have areas that are like the mall with food stands. You can find other places like Paisano's Pizza which also delivers to the strip!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	The hotels on the Strip have big buffets that are usually cheaper than similar ones in other towns.  If buffets aren't your thing, consider eating a really late dinner/early breakfast, like around midnight or the wee hours of the morning, as some casinos have restaurant specials at that time.  Take a stroll on the Strip and you'll find the drink specials advertised as you pass each hotel, sometimes beer is cheaper than cola all day.|`|hRc7Awfbaa	Terribles' Casino and Hotel.  The buffet is terribly good.  It's literally $10.00 per person.<br>  Boulder Station Hotel and Casino.  There is a restaurant in the casino that has BBQ entres for under $15.00.  This is where the locals  and budget minded tourists go.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Paris Las Vegas<br>  3655 Las Vegas Blvd South<br>  Las Vegas, NV 89109<br>  <br>  (702) 946-7000?<br>  harrahs.com<br>  <br>  Binion's Ranch Steakhouse<br>  128 Fremont St<br>  Las Vegas, NV 89101<br>  <br>  (702) 382-1600?<br>  binions.com|`|WbkTTcKtaa	You can take a look at <a href="http://www.ueatcheap.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.ueatcheap.com.</a>  It lists places to eat for $10 or less a person in various cities across the US.

Yuck!|`|UpuWEy3jaa	Check out <a href="http://www.hearditinvegas.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hearditinvegas.com</a> - where you can read and/or post juicy quotes from conversations overheard in Las Vegas.<br>  <br>  What is said in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?<br>  ... Not if we have anything to say about it.|`|2Upd7ev6aa	Before I was married my wife was the type of person who ate very small portions, it was always easy to share a meal and not spend too much cash on food. Well, as many will testify, put a ring on her finger and now she can eat anything in sight. The problem is she now makes me run a few miles each day so that I can keep up with her eating habits.<br>  <br>  So, I need to find those locations around town where a little less money is needed to have a quality meal with that special person I choose to spend my life with. Hope you save some cash as well. There are actually 31 and truthfully, I could have fit in a few more as well.<br>  <br>  Important to note, if you are looking to be frugal while in Las Vegas consider the choice of hotel when making a decision on your Las Vegas vacation. Do a little research and compare room rates before booking. You might save enough to have a very expensive Las Vegas meal.<br>  <br>  Is it also a last minute idea? Don’t worry. Check out these last minute deals. Now, take your time and find the right prices. If you are diligent and patient you’ll find the right deal, the best vacation package and you’ll have the time of your life.<br>  <br>  Mandalay Bay<br>  <br>  1. Caffe Giorgio located in the Mandalay Place offers up pizza’s and pasta for a reasonable price. By yourself, you will easily fall under $25, if you’re with somebody split a pizza and have iced tea and you should still get out cheap.<br>  2. House of Blues, at the Mandalay Bay. My idea of a great cheap meal: A bowl of House of Blues gumbo and a The Caprese Sandwich that includes Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, Roasted Pepper Relish on Toasted French Bread with Pasta Salad<br>  <br>  Also try, Burger Bar, The Deli at the Sports Book<br>  <br>  Luxor<br>  <br>  3. Backstage deliat the Luxor Hotel. It’s simple and easy and open for a large portion of the day. You can get a cheap bagel sandwich to start the day or have a decent sized club sandwich for lunch at around $10<br>  My wife loves the $9 Cobb salad and my kids can split a $3 hot dog.<br>  <br>  Also, La Salsa<br>  <br>  Excalibur<br>  <br>  4. Regale Italian Eatery at the Excalibur. Family style eating is the best way to go, grab a huge portion of Spaghetti and meat sauce or the sausage and peppers. The kids will eat and there might be enough for your mother-in–law to try to sneak in a free meal.<br>  <br>  Also, Food Court on the second floor, Hot Dogs, Crispy Cream, Pizza, McDonalds.<br>  <br>  MGM Grand has plenty of fantastic high end restaurants but it also has a few great places to save a buck on good food.<br>  5. witchcraft,this is a deli with a large dose of adrenaline, everything is kicked up to another level. Have anything with red meat and you will realize that sandwiches do not have to be simple packages of quick fast food. A brief culinary experience awaits you in any of their sandwiches and if you are smart, you take some extra bread just so that you can “munch” on it the rest of the day.<br>  6. Rainforest Café,This is easily one of the most surprising restaurants in Las Vegas for me. The breakfast menu is very good and very affordable. Stay away from the steak and eggs, it will be come an addiction.<br>  7. Stage Deli. Your best bet at the Stage deli is a bowl of soup and a big piece of crusty bread. Well, toss in a beer as well and you are set for way under $25.<br>  <br>  The New York/New York Hotel and Casino offers plenty of good eating choices and a fair amount of options when looking to save a some money.<br>  8. ESPN Zone is a great location if you want a simple menu and a chance to have a beer with your meal. Prices are reasonable and there is little chance that you can break the $25 barrier on just a meal.<br>  9. Gonzalez Y Gonzalez located in the village eateries will satisfy your craving for Mexican food, Most of the entrées are under $15 and you can easily fill up on appetizers that are all under $10.<br>  10. I’l Fornaio<br>  11. Chin Chin<br>  Also, Village Eateries, pizza, sandwiches, fish and chips and plenty more.<br>  <br>  The Monte Carlo has a great food court for low cost meals as well as three places where you can get away from fast food and still stay under $25.<br>  12. Monte Carlo Pub and Brewery<br>  13. Market City Café<br>  14. Dragon Noodle Company<br>  <br>  15. Noodles at the Bellagio Hotel.<br>  <br>  Planet Hollywood Hotel<br>  16. P.F. Changs<br>  17. Cheeseburger in Paradise<br>  <br>  18. JJ's Boulangerie at Paris Las Vegas<br>  <br>  19. Ventuno’s at the Flamingo Las Vegas<br>  <br>  Caesars Palace<br>  20. Planet Hollywood<br>  21. Cheesecake factory<br>  Also, Cypress Marketplace, upscale food court<br>  <br>  23. Carnegie Deli at the Mirage and Canters at Treasure Island are two deli’s where you can share a meal with a friend and still have a little left over. It’s inexpensive if you consider that ordering one item will usually more than an ample amount of food.<br>  <br>  24. Toby Kieth’s I Love This Bar and Grill at Harrah’s<br>  <br>  Venetian Hotel and Casino<br>  25. Postrio at the Venetian<br>  has a burger at lunch time that is worth the $15. It’s pricey, but I would spend the money and have a beer and still come in under $25<br>  26. Taqueria Ca?onita at the Vene

tzrLDbHWaa	Well, first of all, in response to the person who said they didn't do a good job advertising it.... IT WAS ON DURING THE SUPERBOWL!!!!!  Who doesn't watch the superbowl??  It was also on several other channels after the superbowl ad aired.  I went there today and there was like an hour to an hour and a half wait and I just got a rain check, so... yeah, they did a fine job advertising it, since it seems as if almost everyone knew about it.    In response to the question, yes, they did make some money today, just not a huge profit.  Think about it, everyone gets a drink, some even get 2, if they like coffee and OJ with their breakfast and drinks are like pure profit.  Some will get toast as well to go with their eggs, so there will be things they'll make a small amount of money on.  Also, the Grand Slam is like 5.99 but how much does it really cost a restaurant to make it, a buck or 2.      The place where Denny's is making out like a bandit, is on all the free advertising they're getting.  I'm pretty sure that everyone knows about the free grand slam, even if they didn't see the ads on tv, you know someone who did.  I've seen stories on the news about how packed all the Denny's were today, with their lines out the door, thats more free advertising.  On top of that, if even a small percentage of those customers come back for repeat business due to the free grand slam, thats more profit than they would have had otherwise.  In all honesty, they're giving away a 5.99 meal that probably cost them 1.50 to make, make most of the money back on drinks, and get some new customers.  Easily a good business move.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	They had a free grand slam offer?  I doubt they made any extra money, because I watch TV all the time and they didn't do a good job of advertising it.    Believe me, I would happily take any free food available, and I would have paid some for a drink or toast or anything else to get it.  I can deal with the sickness to get the free food.    But I didn't know, so they didn't get my money.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Their point wasn't to make money between the hours of 6am and 2pm They were trying to get people to see that Denny's offers a "REAL BREAKFAST" not like what you get at a Fast Food Restaurant. People now a days don't have the time to sit down and eat a REAL BREAKFAST they just Grab and Run|`|28JhgxO5aa	no..there was a loss of $100,000...give or take. After food costs, and on the assumption that most diners will order a drink with their free meal.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	I heard Denny's had all their employees donate last year's Easter eggs that have been laying around to the free grand slam day.
RnopSbHqaa	allright i think its stupid to dip because you can get mouth cancer go to this site <a href="http://dontdip.tamu.edu/cancer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dontdip.tamu.edu/cancer.htm</a> and just look at the picture and maybe this will change your mind about dip. this picture could happen to you|`|9THRCVtOaa	you will get better in time, if you want to do it right it better be Copenhagen|`|OY4sHHiAaa	try snorting the dip!<br>  its a LOT easier, no need to spit|`|RFPtIcx5aa	Dude, stop watching movies. I never spit when I'm dippin, it's way better that way. Swallowing helps keep the buzz going way longer, and don't worry -- I've never passed out! LOL! U are def not doing it wrong, except you really should try to swallow -- not all the time, obviously, just when you want a real buzz.|`|fNooszxTaa	just stop dipping      gives you cancer
Fex51ntIaa	Putney's a dump. Instead, take the bus to Hammersmith and go to The Gate.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	look in your local newspaper.
TqSPGmIoaa	bus boys do the grunt work and the waiter has to be sociable as a bus boy it would depend how helpful you are and how generous the servers are as a server it depends how competent you are and how generous your customers are|`|aHn6mbLdaa	In my area bus boy would make min. wage. Waiters, if they are good will make good tips thus making much more.
MFcSwTFpaa	about that.  The cost of living in LA is a lot higher than most places so your salary pretty much goes entirely to rent and bills.  you live off your tips.  if you work in a good restaurant or as a bartender in a popular club you can do quite well.  Most waiters walk with about $50 to $100 a day.  If you're a hot girl you average double that.  also keep in mind that nearly all places in LA will not let you work more than 30 hours a week so they dont have to get you health insurance.  It's better to do part time in two places.  Oh, it's very illegal for a company to take your tips.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	They don't make 8 in Texas, either.  I can't imagine a waiter making 8, when a BK cashier only makes 6.5.  Sounds too good to be true.

CUEco2LEaa	I hope so! However in the UK pancakes are more of a dessert than breakfast food. Our pancakes are more like the French crepes, where as the ones in iHOP will stick to your bones! I do love iHOP, but I am glad I only eat there when I go on holiday as I would be huge!<br>  <br>  In the UK, prefer tend to prefer greasy spoon cafes, or see Starbucks coffee as the onlt nourishment they need or eat natural organic fruits of the earth - that macrobiotic nonsense! <br>  <br>  iHOP is just a novelty for holidays for us Brits!|`|zmxMrOO3aa	are you serious i thought IHOP was everywhere well lucky i live in america and when my parents go out to breakfast thats like the only place they go|`|0wTOMifKaa	No.|`|4EfNaDH5aa	It has to!<br>  <br>  No one seems to have heard of it....|`|gaXUIduMaa	Probably not for quite awhile, if ever.  They have not been doing well for years and have since merged with Applebees (another restaurant chain that doesn't do that well).  They need to stop shooting themselves in the foot before they try going international and I would not hold my breath.|`|5lXouSKAaa	that would be great! Unfortunately, IHOP doesnt seem like its going international :/
bmwTSnBfaa	Yeah.. at the railway station, theres a train that will take you to Swansea.... get on it.. ur night will be much better!<br>  I lived in HFW for 3 years... the worst of my life!
