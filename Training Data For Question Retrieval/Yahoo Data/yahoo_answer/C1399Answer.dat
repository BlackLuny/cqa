DyviGDAwaa	I have not had experience but my cousin did. She said after a while she couldn't do it anymore. These kinds of jobs have alot of turnover because it breaks pple down. My advice. Try it out for yourself. If you do it you are not stuck. But she what it's like, see if you can handle it. Don't base your decision on word of mouth. Do it and then make a decision on whether or not you want to stay. But i'm pretty sure a job like this is emotionally draining. If i were you, i'd go for it.

I think you're right...us sags are just having a bad week. your boyfriend will eventualliy call you back (and when he does you can finally nag him and make him regret what he did! muahaha jk) jobs will somehow miraculously work out as well as college.

And the anger thing...i understand but whenever I get angry and explore I think of audrey hepburn LOL i know it sounds weird but she's one of my icons...I'm one girl who HAS to stand up for herself but I'm no ghetto superstar...i'm a lady...so thinking of her helps me to somehow gather my anger and reminds me to be graceful and classy. :)|`|se3oYPooaa	Find a friend who would please you always!|`|pTlnCNYJaa	You are what you think you are and if you think your cold hearted and blunt then thats it.<br>  <br>  Find the positive side of your nature because there is and work on that.

Instead of thinking cold hearted, think honest, loyal, committed, focussed.  <br>  <br>  When you start changing the way you think you will stop looking like someone you wouldnt want to mess with and someone you would love to get to know.

mVTGl6HGaa	Build<br>  <br>  Research has found that male physiques with slim waists are rated as being attractive, particularly by females. [4] Participants also identified physiques with relatively broad shoulders as being attractive. In addition, chest muscularity resulted in slightly higher attractiveness ratings.[4] Preference can also emerge for muscularity, though research has shown that Western men have a tendency to overestimate the amount of muscle considered ideal by women by as much as thirty pounds, whereas Asian men collectively do not exhibit such a misconception.[5] A normal level of the hormone testosterone is a possible indicator of good sexual health. In the absence of normal testosterone levels, a man may exhibit physical symptoms of less muscle development and physical height reduction.<br>  <br>  A near-universal sexually attractive feature of a man is a v-shaped torso: a relatively narrow waist offset with broad shoulders. While some cultures prefer their males huskier and others leaner, the rule of a v-shaped torso generally holds true. Consistently, men with a waist-to-shoulder ratio of 0.75 or lower are viewed as considerably more attractive than men with more even waists and shoulders. [6]<br>  <br>  <br>  Height<br>  <br>  Females' sexual attraction towards a male can be partly determined by the height of the man.[7] Women seem more receptive to an erect posture than men, though both prefer it as an element of beauty; this fact appears correlated to the preference for males who demonstrate confidence, physical strength, and a powerful bearing. This preference can be explained by evolutionary psychology as the fact that ancestral women who were attracted to tall, physically powerful men benefited from better protection and therefore gained evolutionary fitness.[8] Additionally, height in men is associated with status in many cultures, which is beneficial to women romantically involved with them. This preference was passed on genetically. As a corollary, short men are viewed as unattractive for both casual and intended long-term relationships. Studies of women's personal ads support the existence of this preference; in one study of ads requesting height in a mate, 80 percent requested a height of 6 feet or taller. However, this percentage only was of ads specifying height in the first place, and therefore possibly self-selected and/or biased by a third factor such as female height.[8]<br>  <br>  Recent research has found that women are statistically more likely to be attracted to men of average height when looking for long-term commitment, while the opposite is true when a short-term relationship is intended.[9] Cosmopolitan Magazine published an article stating that women are most attracted to men who are 1.1 times their own height. In addition, it was found that women have these different preferences for height depending on the phase of their menstrual cycle at the time. While women usually desire men that are at least the same height as themselves or taller, other factors also determine male attractiveness.[9]<br>  <br>  Variability in preferences<br>  <br>  It has been shown that women prefer more masculine men during the fertile period of the menstrual cycle and more feminine men during other parts of the cycle.[10] This distinction supports the sexy son hypothesis, which posits that it is evolutionarily advantageous for women to select potential fathers who are traditionally masculine rather than the best caregivers.[11] Masculine facial features are characterized by a prominent chin, strong brow, a strong nose, a high forehead[citation needed] and a prominent lower jaw whereas feminine features are less pronounced.
XB9VDLGSaa	In my opinion, one indication would be to see how spoiled they are.  Observe how much self gratification they do in their spare time.  If they spend their spare time doing chores or helping others, then they are mentally wired to do the responsible thing or to think of others.  <br>  <br>  However, if all they do is watch tv or play videos games, they are not likely to be nuturing because they are set on satisfying their own needs.  People in this group, even if they want to have a child, they will probably pass a lot of the responsibility of raising the child to the mother (or father).|`|F32uPjAraa	Usually a good indicator is how they were raised themselves.

I2cdBxHVaa	The obvious answer is go into clinical psychology. However this is a really competitive postgraduate course to get onto and you have to have a lot of experience so start doing work experience every holiday you have from asap! The salary is good though, with NHS employees starting at about 30,000 when training and going onto up to 80,000 as a consultant! <br>  <br>  <br>  Otherwise you can go into child psychology, working within a large company in the HR department making sure the employees mental health is ok. Or you could become a special needs teacher or play worker as you have experience of mental health problems.

Sometimes we just can't cope with things for whatever emotional reason. If you're feeling weak, that's perfectly natural. We all do. No matter how much we don't want to admit it. But, you're only truly weak is when you ignore the problem and you try to seek methods of escape that aren't exactly healthy. <br>  <br>  This world is a very horrible place. It's full of horrible people and scary things. But, it's also full of beauty and wonder and happiness! You just have to learn how to see both, understand both, and appreciate both. Because without the bad, good couldn't exist. Because life needs a harmonious balance. <br>  <br>  Of course there will be secrets in a relationship. It all goes back to trust. You just have to NOT ignore the problem. Be open with him. Tell him how you're feeling and that you want to know the truth. If it has to do with his family though, be careful. Because sometimes, things really aren't meant for your ears. He'll tell you his secrets when he's ready. Give him some time. <br>  <br>  You know, who said ever being a white sheep was fun? If you think about it, always being agreeable and taking sides is so boring. Being a plain old white sheep is dull sometimes. It doesn't matter if you fit it with your family in the sense of always agreeing with them and sharing their views and opinions. No. What matters is that you're happy and that you have your own opinions. Question things. Think things out for yourself. Challenge opinions and views. Because that's how we learn and that's how we define our thoughts on a particular subject. <br>  <br>  If you get worked about nothing, then that's something you need to work on yourself. In the event of getting worked up over something small, stop yourself. Take a deep breath. Step back from the situation. Asses it. And then see if it really is worth getting all huffed and puffed up about. Just remember: breathe, relax, analyze, and use your head. It's very good to use your instinct and intuition but don't let your emotions rule you. And if you feel like your emotions are getting the best of you, try this. "Let the emotion flow; but then let it go." It means that you don't bottle up youremotions, but simply let them flow naturally. But, don’t hold onto them. Make sure you can let them go so that you’re not carrying around the burdens of the world, people, and every day life.<br>  <br>  Don't be upset that you can't cope with relationships. A lot of people can't unless they love the person and are committed. For some people it's hard to be in a relationship because of your own personal insecurities. For example, you might hate how he talks to other girls, won't tell you things, or he'll be unresponsive, or he won't do this or that. You really just have to keep them to yourself so that you won't blow up over something. And then, at the end of the day, confront him about them. Be open with him and tell him what you're feeling. Unless of course he's openly flirting with another girl right in front of you. That's when you have it within your right to do some b**** slapping.<br>  <br>  Challenges are hard. But, then again, they wouldn't be challenges if they were easy. Just relax. Breathe. Live. Laugh. Love. Be happy. Be free. Be yourself. And just do things at your own pace. It's okay if you can't face challenges head on. Maybe you need to take the slow route. But, whatever route you take make sure its the route that you can do and makes you feel comfortable. <br>  <br>  Go with the flow and live your life. Don't worry about troubles and insecurities. Worrying gets you nowhere. Just live! =D
AA10729271	What is the value of a twenty dollar bill worth? The answer seems obvious but in the end that bill is a piece of dirty paper, it only has a precieved value. At one time for every twenty dollar bill that had to be floating around there had to be twenty dollars worth of gold stored away in a government gold reserve. so the bill was a symbolic representation of the value of the gold. These days there are still gold reserves but things are different and the value of money is based of the real/perceived value of many other resources, that's why you can't just print off a few trillion dollars to save the economy, it's still just paper unless you have something of real value to back it up. <br>  <br>  Basically what I'm getting to is credit, using credit is spending money before you actually get it. If the bank gives you a mortage to buy a home, you're buying it on credit, and supposedly the bank should have have something of actual value to back that purchase up. What put the economy in the toliet is that we're all a bunch of credit whores, speding our money before we even earn it, on the personal individual level and on the larger corporational level. Somewhere down the line the fact that all that money was imaginary caught up to us. Why do you think Canada is better off right now, it's because the banks are far more conservative in the loans they hand out. You could say we've all been playing with monopoly money and finally just realized it.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	Many things caused it to go down.

AA11016826	Pretty simple - the state of economy depends on a few factors including government spending. Inflation, growth, and GDP are dependent on how much the government spends on infrastructure, agricultural subsidies, etc. If a country is in war, it spends loads of money for military purposes - transportation of troops, arms, ammunition, food, health care, the list is endless. This is just like dumping truck loads of money in a land fill and burning it!! It is estimated that more than USD 3 trillions has been spent on the Iraq war! DO you know what's the size of the US economy (GDP) = USD 11 - 12 trillions. So, you get an idea as to how much money has been burnt away... imagine what could have been achieved if the money was spent on worthy cause - 3 trillions could have helped the whole of Africa get out of poverty!|`|trMsK86jaa	Technically speaking, a low-standard economy has always lead to war.<br>  <br>  That might well be something worth thinking about - even if it is the poor whom feed themselves from the tit of society, i say that if they advocate peace and pacifism then let them do so.<br>  <br>  I've had enough with all this war-mongering prattle i hear coming from fools who consider themselves important enough to have an opinion.|`|NBy23FHXaa	The end of the Cold War has caused an evolution in the definition of national security. During the Cold War, the threat of the Soviet Union was the focus of national security, and intelligence efforts were concentrated in monitoring it. Now, in the post-Cold War "new world order," national security is seen more in terms of economic strength and vitality than in terms of pure military capability. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, threats to our economic well-being abound. In the "global economy," no longer is there any practical or useful distinction between national economic relations and international economic relations. Most national economies, like that of the United States, are no longer islands where domestic preferences alone dictate outcomes. For example, the devaluation of the Mexican Peso in late 1994 sent United States financial markets into disarray.|`|JsGX1bfRaa	It is said that a war is good for the economy. That was true back in world wars I and II because back then the country had to begin making planes (bombers, fighters, transport aircraft, trainers, etc.), tanks, amphibious craft, trucks, jeeps, ships (large transport and landing craft along with aircraft carriers, battleships and submarines), etc. to be able to fight and maintain a war taking place overseas in europe and across the Pacific. Not to mention medical supplies, fuel, and other necessities. The US was up against the very well-equipped and well-trained armies of Germany, Japan, and to a lesser degree, Italy. The Japanese had a powerful navy (remember Pearl Harbor) and it also had tanks and a well-trained army. Germany had tanks and planes which were even superior to some american models and their army was very well trained. They were also competent strategists in the battlefield. All of this manufacturing sparked the economy and created lots of jobs.<br>  <br>  Today however, the military already has enough equipment ready to handle a war and the funding of fuel and other supplies is paid for by the government at the tune of about 10-12 billion dollars a year in the war in Iraq. The Iraq war has helped a limited amount of businesses like those making armor and supplies for the troops over there but for the most part the military is doing it all by itself with funding from the government.<br>  <br>  So unfortunately the old addage "a war is good for the economy" no longer holds true.|`|5Snex2peaa	The Economic Wargame is a continuation of the Military Wargame by other means.<br>  <br>  All warfare is based in deception. - Sun Tzu<br>  <br>  When have you heard capitalists say that everyone should know accounting?

Psychodynamic psychotherapy may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but there are no controlled studies that demonstrate effectiveness of psychoanalysis or dynamic psychotherapy in OCD<br>  <br>  Behavioral therapy<br>  The specific technique used in BT/CBT is called exposure and ritual prevention (also known as "exposure and response prevention") or ERP; this involves gradually learning to tolerate the anxiety associated with not performing the ritual behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly habituates to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level has dropped considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<br>  <br>  Exposure ritual/response prevention has been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for OCD. It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychotropic medication, is more effective than either option alone. However, more recent studies have shown no difference in outcomes for those treated with the combination of medicine and CBT versus CBT alone.[40]<br>  <br>  Recently it has been reported simultaneous administration of D-Cycloserin (an antibiotic) substantially improves effectiveness of Exposure and Response prevention.<br>  <br>  <br>   Medication<br>  Medications as treatment include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine (Seroxat, Paxil, Xetanor, ParoMerck, Rexetin), sertraline (Zoloft, Stimuloton), fluoxetine (Prozac, Bioxetin), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluvoxamine (Luvox) as well as the tricyclic antidepressants, in particular clomipramine (Anafranil). SSRIs prevent excess serotonin from being pumped back into the original neuron that released it. Instead, serotonin can then bind to the receptor sites of nearby neurons and send chemical messages or signals that can help regulate the excessive anxiety and obsessive thoughts. In some treatment-resistant cases, a combination of clomipramine and an SSRI has shown to be effective even when neither drug on its own has been efficacious.<br>  <br>  Benzodiazepines are also used in treatment. It's not uncommon to administer this class of drugs during the "latency period" for SSRIs or as synergistic adjunct long-term. Although widely prescribed, benzodiazepines have not been demonstrated as an effective treatment for OCD and may be habit-forming in those with a history of substance abuse.<br>  <br>  Serotonergic antidepressants typically take longer to show benefit in OCD than with most other disorders which they are used to treat, as it is common for 2–3 months to elapse before any tangible improvement is noticed. In addition to this, the treatment usually requires high doses. Fluoxetine, for example, is usually prescribed in doses of 20 mg per day for clinical depression, whereas with OCD the dose will often range from 20 mg to 80 mg or higher, if necessary. In most cases antidepressant therapy alone will only provide a partial reduction in symptoms, even in cases that are not deemed treatment-resistant. Much current research is devoted to the therapeutic potential of the agents that effect the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate or the binding to its receptors. These include riluzole, memantine, gabapentin (Neurontin) and lamotrigine (Lamictal).<br>  <br>  Low doses of the newer atypical antipsychotics olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone and risperidone (Risperdal) have also been found to be useful as adjuncts in the treatment of OCD. The use of antipsychotics in OCD must be undertaken carefully, however, since, although there is very strong evidence that at low doses they are beneficial (most likely due to their dopamine receptor antagonism), at high doses these same antipsychotics have proven to cause dramatic obsessive-compulsive symptoms even in those patients who do not normally have OCD. This can be due to the antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors becoming very prominent at these doses and outweighing the benefits of dopamine antagonism. However antidepressant mirtazapine which is a 5-HT2A antagonist has shown to be of benefit to OCD patients[43]. Another point that must be noted with antipsychotic treatment is that SSRIs inhibit the chief enzyme that is responsible for metabolising ant|`|trMsK86jaa	"few hook ups to move on"<br>  <br>  Oh, you poor victim of the 21st century pseudo-myth that the best way to get over someone is to sleep with someone else.<br>  <br>  Oh, you poor thing.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, i think you should take better care of what's inside your head and not what's inside your balls.

mVTGl6HGaa	The Future of Socialism by Anthony Crosland, published in 1956, is regarded as one of the most influential books in post-war British Labour Party thinking[citation needed]. It was considered by many the seminal work of the 'revisionist' school of Labour politics.[1] Crosland, an Oxford academic before entering Parliament, had lost his seat in the 1955 General Election and so was able to finish the book he had been working on for several years, seeking to offer a new argument for social democracy in the context of the new political and economic consensus introduced by the 1945-51 Clement Attlee governments.<br>  <br>  Some argue that no book of the stature of the Future of Socialism has been written since 1956, leaving Labour to live off its intellectual capital[citation needed]. However, the Future of Socialism has continued to be a reference point for intellectual debates within the Labour party and the centre-left in succeeding generations - including the SDP-Labour split in 1981, the modernisation of Labour under Neil Kinnock and the rise of New Labour. The book's 50th anniversary in 2006 sparked a new debate with leading Labour figures including Gordon Brown, Jack Straw [2] , Ed Miliband [3], Roy Hattersley [4] and others setting out views of its relevance to the next generation of 'post-New Labour' politics. The Fabian Society which copublished the new 2006 edition set out the argument about 'renewal' of Labour's thinking after a decade in power requires a further generation of 'revisionist' thinking which seeks to emulate Crosland's contribution in the 1950s.<br>  <br>  A central argument in the book is Crosland's distinction between 'means' and 'ends'. Crosland demonstrates the variety of socialist thought over time, and argues that a definition of socialism founded on nationalisation and public ownership is mistaken, since these are simply one possible means to an end. For Crosland, the defining goal of the left should be more social equality. Crosland argued that<br>  “  In Britain, equality of opportunity and social mobility... are not enough. They need to be combined with measures... to equalise the distribution of rewards and privileges so as to diminish the degree of class stratification, the injustices of large inequalities and the collective discontents.  ”<br>  <br>  Crosland also argued that an attack on unjustified inequalities would give any left party a political project to make the definition of the end point of 'how much equality' a secondary and more academic question.<br>  <br>  Crosland also developed his argument about the nature of capitalism (developing the argument in his contribution 'The Transition from Capitalism' in the 1952 New Fabian Essays). Asking, 'is this still capitalism?', Crosland argued that post-war capitalism had fundamentally changed, meaning that the Marxist claim that it was not possible to pursue equality in a capitalist economy was no longer true. Crosland wrote that,<br>  “  The most characteristic features of capitalism have disappeared - the absolute rule of private property, the subjection of all life to market influences, the domination of the profit motive, the neutrality of government, typical laissez-faire division of income and the ideology of individual rights.  ”<br>  <br>  Crosland argued that these features of a reformed managerial capitalism were irreversible. Others within the Labour Party argued that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan brought about its reversal.<br>  <br>  A third important argument was Crosland's liberal vision of the 'good society'. Here his target was the dominance in Labour and Fabian thinking of Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, and a rather grey, top down bureaucratic vision of the socialist project. Following Tawney, Crosland stressed that equality would not mean uniformity:<br>  “  We need not only higher exports and old-age pensions, but more open-air cafes, brighter and gayer streets at night, later closing hours for public houses, more local repertory theatres, better and more hospitable hoteliers and restaurateurs, brighter and cleaner eating houses, more riverside cafes, more pleasure gardens on the Battersea model, more murals and pictures in public places, better designs for furniture and pottery and women’s clothes, statues in the centre of new housing estates, better-designed new street lamps and telephone kiosks and so on ad infinitum.  ”<br>  <br>  [edit] Reaction and reputation<br>  <br>  The book was highly controversial at the time of its publication, given the heated dispute between the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites over the future direction of the Labour Party. A review of Crosland's book in the left-wing Tribune newspaper became famous for its headline 'How dare he call himself a socialist'. [5] The book was however largely positively received in the media and right-wing circles of the Labour Party.<br>  <br>  Labour thinkers and academics have continued to debate the relevance of Crosland's thinking to more recent political debates within the party. A significant criticism of Crosla

Hope that helps :)|`|NBy23FHXaa	Commerce means activity to make a profit or personal benefit (e.g. trade etc.)<br>  <br>  Economics deals with scarce resource allocation to maximize utility.<br>  <br>  So commerce might be only small part of economics but not necessarily fully inclusive.<br>  <br>  Economics is the branch of social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term economics comes from the Greek for oikos (house) and nomos (custom or law), hence "rules of the house(hold)."<br>  <br>  Modern economics developed out of the broader field of political economy in the late 19th century, owing to a desire to use an empirical approach more akin to the physical sciences. A definition that captures much of modern economics is that of Lionel Robbins in a 1932 essay: "the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses." Scarcity means that available resources are insufficient to satisfy all wants and needs. Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, there is no economic problem. The subject thus defined involves the study of choices as they are affected by incentives and resources.<br>  <br>  Commerce :<br>  <br>  Commerce is a division of trade or production which deals with the exchange of goods and services from producer to final consumer. It comprises the trading of something of economic value such as goods, services, information or money between two or more entities. Commerce functions as the central mechanism which drives capitalism and certain other economic systems (but compare command economy, for example). Commercialization or commercialisation consists of the process of transforming something into a product, service or activity which one may then use in commerce.<br>  <br>  Commerce primarily expresses the fairly abstract notions of buying and selling, whereas trade may refer to the exchange of a specific class of goods ("the sugar trade", for example), or to a specific act of exchange (as in "a trade on the stock-exchange").<br>  <br>  Business can refer to an organization set up for the purpose of engaging in manufacturing or exchange, as well as serving as a loose synonym of the abstract collective "commerce and industry".

But that doesn't mean they didn't work.  Most women have always had to work, and work hard.  And women who were in paid employment were in general paid a lot less for their work than men were.<br>  <br>  As for men tending flocks, in medieval times it was just as likely to be women tending flocks,a nd women did sheep shearing etc.  And it was women who did the spinning of wool into cloth, and until the late medieval period, the weaving as well.  In Colonial America, men would hardly have survived without women performing all the vital chores necessary to keep the colony going, of which cloth production was one of the most important (cloth was in very short supply in colonial America).<br>  <br>  Moreover, most businesses int he pre-industrial era were family affairs, with wives expected to contribute, and to look after things while the husbands were away.  As for example Mary Read Franklin did while Ben Franklin was sojourning in Europe.  She wasn't sitting around complaining, she was getting on with the work.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Well theres the sex trade, the no voting, the sanctioning of voilence agains women in the home, the legal status of rape and the general "use" of women(and boys) sexually, the treatment of women as seducers, less rational, the fact that they werent allowed do these jobs, and if they did they were paid less. The fact that out of a woman  and man working the woman is expected to go home and take care of the children and give up her job. There was the treatment of womenShe has no choice.<br>   Also there would be no civilisation without women to make and raise children either. and most postwar countries which we live in would not be able to sustain themselves without the work of women. Finally the counterculture, womens and gay liberation movement of the 1980s have basically created the culture charged diverse societies we live in today. A final point is womens disadvantage is mens disadvantage too, women arent allowed work, men are not allowed work at home. Women are only good for caring for kids men are no good for caring for kids, women are overly emotional, men are not allowed show emotions and suffer high suicide rates as a result.

Any man in Rome and Greece can slit his woman's throat and simply say "She was a drunk" or "A whore" and no punishment will therefore be taken. This would be a little worrying since the marriageable age for many women were under 14. Plus, rape is the tool for conquest. It was seen and acknowledged in the roman era and goes all the way up to now. In fact, you can actually see through historical texts how native women in california alone had lost their own freedom in their hunter-gatherer society (women had done both things and covered vast territories) when the conquistadores hunted them down to rape them. Yes, their men had tried to protect them, but that act was short-lived at gun-point. Hence why these women were soon locked themselves in their huts and later cramped quarters in monasteries. <br>  In the birth of industry much of these workers were actually women and children. When in 1834 the attempt to solve the vast no. of poor created 'indoor relief'--meaning the emergence of the famous work houses from Oliver Twist, much of the poor were segregated and stuck in a harsh regime where silence is obligatory and factory work mandatory. Women were separated from their own children and their husbands 24/7, and later on, women and children were almost the only people hired for work because it gave the factory owners and mine owners the excuse to pay them more cheaply. At one point a mill owner locked the entrance doors of the building where 46 girls are trapped inside, claiming that because many of them were tardy they would now have to make up with lost time by doing more work. 30 % of these girls were under 13 and were doing night shifts anyway. All girls were killed when the building was burned to the ground by an accidental fire. <br>  <br>  I must remind you that it was through social reforms banning women and children from harsh conditions did such hard work become the plight of men. And in the case of african-americans, after their emancipation by Abraham lincoln, the law of their freedom unfortunately had as many loopholes as swiss cheese. one man reportedly said that the slavers "Let us out like stray dogs". Masses of people who never knew how to support themselves and are hated by everyone for the civil war and themselves being the reminder, many of them fell right into poverty. Reportedly single mothers were on the rise in this group because many men were forced to leave their large families from the pressure of having to care for them all. Many african american women had to take prostitution, even to their once-slave owners who claimed that it was not because they were desperate, but because they were naturally promiscous and liked it. This stereotype of a crass and over-sexualised black woman existed from there on up to the 70's. <br>  <br>  You guys may have the history of bulding entire civilisations, laws and armies, even toiled alongside us under the regimes, but at least none of you have the stigmata like many of us do. Some of us are still seen as disrespectful of ourselves and improper, especially if we looked ethnic. Asian girls remind everyone of the darker days in Chinatown or the stereotypes of geishas and exotic dominatrixes. While black women were reminded of deep-rooted myths told by white slave owners against the very idea that black people should be seen as human and equal to everyone. Even white women from pretty low backgrounds are even seen as crass and slutty--in england if you dress and talk like a chav you're likely to already have 4 kids from different fathers by age of 16. In the states it's the same expectation if you lived in a trailer park. Even I feel pressured by people for being different by never having been raised by sane parents and living in an actual house. Especially when my spanish family feel that I should stop everything and be a dutiful grandaughter supporting my family, never mind we now have enough money for 3 college degrees. They just simply feel that it would be all for nothing and that I was simply being coddled for not following my cousin's footsteps in helping the family the traditional way since the age of 12. I don't know but I hadn't met a guy with the same problem as I have just yet.|`|prTLJnXFaa	oh boo hoo. poor e grimely has it so hard because the world is his and if he falls flat on his *** no one's going to pick him up and brush him off.

pTlnCNYJaa	How old are you and what is BPD, sounds like a mental health disorder.<br>  <br>  Introverted people are loners.  They need solitude to process information because they have to feel it to understand it. They dont like being in crowds and only have a hand full or less people for friends.  These friends they usually keep for life. <br>  <br>  They are extremely loyal, warm hearted, empathic and very intuitive people.  Online chat things are not for the introvert because it feels like they're interupting or invading in someone elses conversations, and they find it hard to just jump in anyway, they are very humble.<br>  <br>  The introvert needs to understand the term and be comfortable in their skin.  Do some research and stop giving yourself a disorder that probably doesnt exist (and i'm assuming that is what BPD is). The drug company is already making a killing with people who think they have a problem.<br>  <br>  More social activity will make itself present when you accept and like who you are and you can only do that when you understand yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.|`|1iXvphNYaa	What you need is practice.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I used to work at Corrections (headquarters) and did a lot of research on various topics.<br>  <br>  My opinion, is that some people like the control - over life or death - that they have by killing animals.  And if it is a sadistic / torture killing - they may grow bored with it - and move onto doing the same thing to humans.<br>  <br>  Some people have a hatred of others - so bad that they enjoy tormenting other people.  It may be at several  different levels.  <br>  <br>  I worked for the state at one agency and we had 3 levels of management that really enjoyed tormenting the employees.  I was a supervisor and would be called in and given orders to cause the employees to have problems on the job.  I would refuse.  It was so bad that one employee came in and jumped out a 24th story window.  The managers, just sat around and told jokes about it - that they missed seeing his face when he hit.<br>  <br>  When I went to Corrections and learned more about criminals, I used to go home and tell my wife to be more careful when she dealt with people.  That there were some people who just went out and hunted for someone they could torture and kill.  My wife, would tell me I was over-reacting.  Now retired, she has time to watch several of the true-crime shows on tv - and she now fusses at me "why didn't you tell me they are this bad?"<br>  <br>  There was a guy who killed for over 20 years in Kansas, his nickname was BTK - for Bind (tie up), Torture, Kill.  (SEE THE LINK BELOW) Which is what he did to his victims.  Come to find out, he held a high position in a local church.  And when he was finally caught, he readily admitted that he would drive around looking for people who he could BTK.  Then he would stalk them.  And then attack them.<br>  <br>  That is the true danger.  People who do these types of things - look and act - just like you and me - until they are ready to do the abuse.  So who can you really trust?|`|ND1nFEWSaa	the bible says only kill an animal that which you need to eat|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	To me it's a power thing. Hurting or killing any innocent animal for kicks is just down right sick.<br>  <br>  I worked in a shelter for many years and my heart wouldn't break, it would shatter to see  some animals come in so  beaten up and frightened.<br>  <br>  Hunting, like you said is ok for population control. But when an innocent animal is being hurt so badly that it can't defend it's self really makes me sick.|`|669bRlkuaa	They hurt or kill animals because the are sick, like the other peeps said.

o2FJIXS9aa	My first guess is that you are sexually attracted to him still. My second is that you still feel vulnerable to him and might want to get back with him, because there is nothing more vulnerable than being nude in front of someone. I still have dreams about my teenage boyfriend being naked with me and I think that's because I idealized the relationship and never found anyone that I thought was more sexually attractive.|`|trMsK86jaa	I had a dream like that once, only it wasn't my ex nor anyone i had met before(though i've never "officially" dated someone, heh).<br>  <br>  We were in bed together, doing nothing.<br>  <br>  Maybe i should make a song about my "dream girl" lol.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  It could show desire / sexual intention or vulnerability - depends on the emotions that went with the dream?<br>  <br>  Sadhara
srIMFTb8aa	Men need the seat up 50% of the time and down the other 50% of the time.  Women need the seat down 100% of the time.  This averages out to seat down 75% of the time and up 25% of the time.  Majority rules.|`|AA11307468	I was raised to believe that leaving the seat and lid up is rude.  No one wants to be able to look into the toilet bowl unless they are about to use it, so keep the seat and lid down, please.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Why does her man have to do what she says? She never leaves it up for him; why should he have to cater to her? She's a grown woman.

This is what we do in my house and there is never, ever fighting about whether it's up or down.|`|wkjncmHTaa	There is no big deal. I'm happy to use the toilet with the seat up or down, and have never had an argument about it in my life. I don't entirely understand how men can't aim with the lid down though.

And since I live in a household with three males I am heavily outnumbered on this issue and don't consider it worth arguing about.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Toilets look more unattractive with the seat up. <br>  <br>  The natural position is down with the lid being closed. <br>  <br>  When a woman accidentally sits on a toilet with the seat up they can fall in.  <br>  <br>  Seat up looks ugly. I do not spend all that money on pretty floor rugs, matching towels and keep the bathroom sparkly clean so the man can leave the seat up and make the bathroom look ugly.|`|nhZb43pIaa	Though I have never argued about it, women like it down for two reasons.<br>  1. If you have ever gotten up in the middle of the night half asleep with no lights on and walk into the bathroom and sit down, splash, you fall right in, it's cold, wet and startling.<br>  2. It's much more sanitary and looks visually more appealing.<br>  <br>  That's it in a nutshell.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	If it's "just a toilet seat" to you, why argue?<br>  <br>  We actually get hurt if we are unaware of the seat up.

I now watch where I plant my ***.|`|wRLidVqkaa	I've never argued about it either, I thought it was just something actors did in American sitcoms.

But then again I don't want to see how much the guy has missed the toilet bowl on the exposed rim, let alone having to pull the seat down knowing that my guy friends hadn't cleaned it in weeks. Filthy toilet seats reminds me of having to clean after my bros every week and I don't want to remember, thanks. <br>  <br>  In argument, I'd like to say that at least *I* clean after myself when it's the time of the month. No blood, therefore no sickening my male guests. *bows*|`|Nhje1U06aa	I agree . usually when people fight over a toilet seat there is something else bothering them-for ex the toilet seat represents you don't appreciate me or why don't we have sex any more etc.......<br>  <br>  Some people are just compulsive and have to have everything a certain way|`|T7HuKzZcaa	well, i have an 8 year old daughter and a cat.   since i do not want a wet cat or toothbrush falling into the bowl, ours is always closed anyway<br>  <br>  even when there was a man around the house it was always down-  much safer that way|`|NnG8PxMzaa	I agree, I really don't see why people get so upset about things like that.  Seriously, you just smack it closed and go to the bathroom.  It's hardly something to start a genuine fight about.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	I never understood that idiotic issue either<br>  <br>  If the toilet seat is up and you don't want it up then put it down<br>  <br>  Simple|`|CBbsulYCaa	I have always thought this is a non-issue.

It might even just be that your child is normal and just has some odd behavoir patterns, but if you treat him like he has a disorder, he may well develop one - self fulfilling prophecy. If you are concerned, take him to a child psychologist. It can be quite harmful to assume a diagnosis from an untrained source is true.|`|p1gzHgAraa	you shouldnt be asking this question here IMO, you should be calling a psychologist and having him evaluated. No one here can diagnose legally on a yahoo forum. Best of luck to you and your son-please get him help!|`|QjifsTNfaa	I think you need to go talk to your son and not rely on what other people necessarily say. If he's insecure then go talk to him and figure out the problem. Tell him it's okay and you're there for him. Work the problem out with him.
m89kGXBnaa	You're fine. Should you do anything to get back at her, you will not be fine. The police will not be understanding if you go break a glass out of anger, etc. The best thing here is to just walk away and have nothing to do with her again, as your relationship is effectively ruined.<br>  <br>  Basically, she tried to do something and failed, so although you are understandly angry that she tried, there's no reason to try for revenge.|`|UqDIhxcdaa	Just get another girl to beat her up haha. soz don't know
8S4fthAraa	OK. Overall questions, are you 18? And if so, are you still a virgin? If you are, well, how can I say this, have sex! If you're 18 or over 18, it's probably lack of physical release. t's totally natural to masturbate though. But I mean if you're doing it this often, have sex. It's nothing to be ashamed of either.

vAdtlZDpaa	To dream that you are vomiting indicates that you need to reject or discard an aspect of your life that is revolting. There are some emotions or concepts that you need to confront and then let go. <br>  <br>  Hair is a symbol for your thoughts and attitudes . You said the hair was super-thick, like rope, which would indicate that the thoughts or attitudes were very ingrained, strongly held beliefs or ideas.  <br>  <br>  I think the part about the girl "just standing there looking at" you indicates you not receiving any outside help with this issue. You said that you felt sad, which means that you have repressed feelings of sadness about this in your waking life, so they are being expressed while you are dreaming. <br>  <br>  To have a dream that takes place at night represents some major setbacks and obstacles in achieving your goals. There are some issues in your life that you are facing, but are not too clear. You should put the issues aside so you can clear your head and come back to it later.|`|XOSc4cq3aa	You're a cat.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	You're dream of vomiting hair means your dissatisfied with you're <br>     hairdresser and you're hairdresser hates doing your hair she is cursing you while doing you're hair..

2Ifa1Qd4aa	After a game of volley ball at the beach, my friends, 5 girls and 7 guys including myself sat in circle, san tanning and started chatting. The session developed into truth or dare.<br>  <br>  The twist was, I survived my truth very well. However, when one of the girls was asked to dare. That was when my most humiliating experience was about to develop.<br>  <br>  Her dare was to massage me in my underwear. That meant that i had to strip for her in front of all, in public (the beach was luckily secluded.) If I refused, that will mean she had to have a penalty.<br>  <br>  Then, the guys came to her rescue. They started to rip my clothes off, and soon, I was pinned down in my grey briefs. The girl was shy and gingerly massaged my body (more like touching). Then, the girls directed her to sit on my legs and work her way down. When her hands arrived at my waist, the guys rolled me over and a spare pair of hands yanked my underwear off!<br>  <br>  But the ordeal was not over. In my state of desperation, all I heard was laughter and i finally saw my pair of briefs held high in the air by one of my friend, as if it were a trophy; and he was running towards the water as I followed. then, he deliberately flunk it into a crashing wave.<br>  <br>  They all had a good laugh as they saw me surface, clad in my wet pair of underwear. The boys were laughing hard when they pointed at my briefs that seemed to outline my privates.<br>  <br>  If all endings had a happy ending, I had a relationship with one of the girls not long later.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	I was feeling super sick in school in grade 5.<br>  I ran really fast into the bathroom, which ended up being the boys bathrom!!<br>  I ran into the stall and ended up throwing up all over a boys bare lap!!!<br>  OMG!!!<br>  I felt so embarrassed, I just ran out, without saying sorry, but now I wish I had.<br>  <br>  I was at my cousins house with my parents and my friend.<br>  I badly wanted a puppy and kept bugging my family for it and so they all went into the basment to talk about it.<br>  My friend and I stood at the first step which for some reasonw as outside the door and we were listenign.<br>  We soon heard my mum say they would get me a puppy for x-mas.<br>  M and my friend started jumping around saying "yah yah! woohoo!" and then the step broke and we went flying through the floor.<br>  Everyone was staring at us, all we did was get up and go " . . . bye" and ran upstairs. lol<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!!

No, I was never one to be embarrassed because I can laugh at myself. But, romantically with that kind of mushy embarrassment between people is a definite. With my current love, he told me he loved me and I was so surprised. Because, I mean, he choose ME and I felt just like this whole awestruck thing happen. And I was like "wh...wh...what? REALLY?! Seriously? Are you sure? I mean..." and I as such a dope. He almost thought I didn't love him back. It was quite funny xD|`|5FRpnmLAaa	I was swimming with my boy friend in a public pool. He's too scared to go in the deep end (Well, it is 10 Meters deep!!!) so he just sat on the edge while watching me dive in. He kept on nagging me about how Ii need to get my legs straight leg and stuff like that, and I had just had enough!!! I tried to pull him in, but I grabbed his trunks down instead by accident!!! He was yelling like a two year old. I was just confused, so I grabbed his leg. Well, at least I tried to grab his leg!!! Because he was wriggling about so much, I missed his leg!!! I think you can I guess what I grabbed instead!!! So there I was!!! Floating in the deepest part of a swimming pool with about 80 people in it (It was quite busy on that day) grabbing onto a 14 year old's penis!!! I didn't know what to do, so I let go and swam out of the poool imediately. His trunks had sunk to the bottom, and he couldn't swim very well. He was standing there, naked in front of 80 people!!! He could of least put is hand over his penis!!! But he didn't. So I called the life guard, and he just stood there laughing!!! What an amutear!!! So I HAD to dive down to get my boy friend's swimming trunks to cover up his dangling penis. I ran into the girls changing rooms, silently dragging him with me!!! I went into the first cubicle, and he stood in the cubicle next to me, IN THE GIRLS ROMMS!!! Then when I was changed, I let him in the cubicle I was in, but then he needed a pee!!! He stil hadn't put his trunks on. He had to go into the girls loos and lift up the seat!!! I dragged him out after he hadn't even pulled up his swimming trunks, and he walked by me!!! He silently got changed in the girls changing rooms. (He had to get changed into my spare clothes coz his were in the boys!!!) I was so embarassed. When I walked out silently, everyone was staring at me and my boy friend. I was crazy not to dump him I know, but I kinda feel guilty for letting him look so stupid!! It was mainly my fault, after all. To make it worse, the cooler girls from our school were there the whole time!!! At least they didn't have a camera!!! <br>  <br>  What a cringe!!!  I bet knowone can beat that!!!|`|XOSc4cq3aa	A girl I knew gained a lot of weight. I thought she was pregnant, and ask her when she was due? She wasn't pregnant. I was so embarrassed.
ZRG7wEf9aa	Have you noticed the common element in your dreams is broken or locked up? I suspect your in a phase of repeating the past failures in your life.  You were supposed to have learned your lessons and translated that into changed behaviors.  But  for some reason, you don't want to make permanent changes in your life so your dreams are stuck repeating the negative over and over.
d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Sounds to me like you were born with genuine memories of a past life. If that's the case, there's a reason. You're not alone in this. There are many people who understand what you're going through. Me for one. When we're kids I think *most* of us experience flashbacks and impressions of memories, but most of the time we're quickly brainwashed into believing that our memories are just "make believe." Are you acquainted with this story? <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Technology/Story?id=894217&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Technolo...</a> <br>  <br>  There's a respected body of research on the evidence of past-life recall, particularly in young children, such as the work by Dr. Ian Stevenson, which led the brilliant hardcore skeptic Carl Sagan to conclude in his book "Demon-Haunted World" that reincarnation "might be true." Dr. Stevenson wrote a few books on the subject, as did Brian Weiss and a few others you might want to read more about.<br>  <br>  You should definitely check out this website too: <a href="http://www.childpastlives.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.childpastlives.org/</a> It has a (moderated) discussion board where people share stories about past-life memories.|`|u33x2hqzaa	I don't believe in reincarnation but even if it is real I don't think it relates to the life we currently have.  The key word in your story is "dream."  Dreams play out parts of our psyche and it's dangerous to equate a recurring dream with past lives whooey.  Make your decision about whether to serve based on how you feel about it during waking rational hours.  I used to have recurring dreams about spiders falling over me.  Does that mean I was a spider in a past life? :)|`|TZ3FgkqZaa	wow, that's actually really really interesting... i think if you believe in being reborn, it's definitely a possibility. either way, it's definitely something to think about.|`|mPCSbit3aa	Perhaps|`|C3cH7RALaa	Very True<br>  try to read abt HIndu Religion books<br>  there u ll find ur all answer of ur questions.<br>  good luck.|`|Hu4PI0q2aa	wow, that's actually really really interesting... i think if you believe in being reborn, it's definitely a possibility. either way, it's definitely something to think about. but with us as Christians we do not think about that all we know is that there is a heaven and that is were we will be when we die.|`|QjifsTNfaa	Yes, it is very possible. Many people are reincarnated but we normally don't remember our past lives until we become spiritually "aware." Or are about to become aware. What you're seeing is perfectly normal. Don't worry too much about it, unless of course you want to explore it further.

8d8ejHPfaa	Well, I don't think it's related to the car battery dying (good try though!)  :)<br>  This doesn't sound like a near death experience, I think it's symbolic.<br>  So when you were driving your car, did you die in an accident, or just kind of expire for some reason?  It reads as a transformation of some kind, like you've resolved a problem of some sort.  It would help if you can remember what you observed in your visit to the afterlife.  Personally, I believe we will all be surprised when we actually get there, and find it quite unlike the way it has been depicted to us :)  So I guess I'm not actually expecting the whole clouds and golden harps thing.  But anyway, whatever you did observe in your dream afterlife could have symbolic meaning if you can remember it.  <br>  I don't believe you really died, but if you are overweight or have breathing problems, you might want to check into whether you may have sleep apnea.  In sleep apnea, you stop breathing for a short time during your sleep, it often occurs during rem sleep, so it's possible that if you stopped breathing, that could possibly have brought on the idea of dying.  It's possible your anti anxiety pills may have had a hand in this, but I feel it more likely you have resolved one of the problems or issues that are the reason you're on them in the first place.<br>  <br>  Hi Skaterchik, people die in their dreams all the time, but they don't die from dreaming they are going to die....|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I never used to dream of dying, but lately I've been having tons of dreams, I either become a ghost in them, or I go to hell.

ZlNFOgO7aa	I have just done psychology and studied this.<br>  <br>  REM sleep is just what everyone else has said...the stage of sleep you dream in. It is actually the heaviest stage of sleep and you are the most active. Each sleep cycle you have through the night the REM  sleep portion lengthens, so the longer you have been asleep, the longer you stay in REM sleep and dream. So early hours of the morning equals the longest stretches of REM sleep, then you wake up and start your day so you remember your last dream just before you wake up.<br>  <br>  the stages of sleep go like this. Stage 1 heavy sleep, stage 2 sleep lightens up to go into stage 3 which is deep, then goes into stage 4 (REM), then it back tracks through stages 3 2, then back down again 2 3 4 etc all night until you wake up and stay awake.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  We dream during REM (rapid eye movement) stages & that is during lighter moments of sleep, so when nodding off & waking. <br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|trMsK86jaa	Chances are you only remember the last stages of your dreams.<br>  <br>  I recall an experiment anyway where they had a bunch of people who were being monitered on brainwaves, and they managed a successful reading of someone who claimed to be dreaming and was also exhibiting D-Waves (i think it's delta..) at an increased rate.<br>  <br>  Chances are you could have a dream, go on to have another dream in the same night, but only remember the first.|`|KLfx3JQYaa	We dream when in the theta brain wave.  Sleep is not consistent.  It takes about 10 minutes to reach the first theta set. Throughout the night you will go up and down in brain waves. the first theta set is about 10 minutes long, and 90 minutes later you will enter the next theta set.  This set is slighty longer than the first. and so on until you are about 9 hours in.  Then you wake up.  The last theta set can be as long as 45 minutes.  So if you want to use dream-programming (so you dream about what you want) set your alarm for a 90 minute interval after you fall asleep.  Remember, the later in your sleep cycle you do it, the longer the dream will be.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, you could just not be remembering the time in between your dream and awakening because there is almost no sensory input. Also, you dream about 5 times a night. So you could remember only the dream right before getting up.|`|ZKrFSestaa	There are 4 stages in the sleep cycle.  We dream during REM sleep (the 3rd stage), and it accounts for 25% of our time sleeping at night.  its is characterized by rapid eye movements and body paralysis.  .We cannot dream until we pass through the first 2 stages Each of the first two stages we spend roughly 90-110 minutes in, and then we move into REM. Depending on how many hours you are sleeping a night, you could be waking up before you regress back through the sleep stages (ie, right after REM).  People usually report vivid dreams as a function of how soon they "exited" the REM stage.|`|TdRgGCJPaa	I heard that most dreams uccor 15 seconds before the minute that we wake up.<br>  Hmmmm, suprising and interesting lol ha ha!!!!
98OlWbtXaa	Yup.  A lot of times when I laugh hard, I get teary-eyed and my face turns red, so when I stop smiling it looks like I've been crying.

PRtbcEj0aa	Yep same. No ones happy with infinite loneliness. Im a bit of an introvert at times tooooo.. its not antisocialism or something. its like, i like to be alone to think and draw and i dont know. its not like being a loner, just someone that doesnt like continuous noise. <br>  <br>  anyways. its hard to find someone that will just spend time. i prefer silence to awkward small talk and people just seem to want to fill up the silence. <br>  <br>  its completely normal, isnt it a human tendency to want to socialise/wanna be with people? <br>  <br>  meh. im too tired xD|`|I2cdBxHVaa	Humans are naturally social animals so we need companionship. Also, the urge to reproduce is innate, you can't not feel the urge even if you consciously have said you will never have children. Being an introvert doesn't mean you don't need social stimulation.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Yes, definitely.  No one is 100% introvert or 100% extrovert.  Even the most hardcore introvert needs a little companionship, and even the most extreme extrovert needs to be alone once in a way.|`|u33x2hqzaa	Of course it's natural.  I'm an introvert too and I need people in my life to feel happy.  We're social animals as well as thinking machines.  The trick is to find people who either share your interests or have different ones that interest you.  If they are introverts like you then you will have similar boundaries about socializing and the need to get away and do your own thing.  I love solitude and the ability to curl up with a good book and read about other people's lives LOL.  Being around people too much is draining but not having people around at all is indeed lonely and just might cause you to go crazy you know like the unibomber. ;)
Q9NHnC9Vaa	Hello 88Angel, <br>  <br>  <br>  if having male organs means some dignity and money e.g. winning some lottery, getting a nice and respectful job, or getting some money from other sources like grand parents or parents etc. <br>  <br>  Having a male organ for pregnant women means their baby will be a boy.<br>   <br>  Basically such dream is not very appealing, but has great meaning.

As for the dream I'm sure Mr. freud would enjoy a chance to interpret this although I'll just disturb him a little by doing this myself, the female symbolics are part of the influence your father has in your life after all you are according to Freud, a competitive issue with your mother for the father's approval.|`|klJOzdfXaa	well maybe becoz u think that u should be a guy. coz people normaly dream of wat they think may happen or should happen. <br>  its normal to have such weird dreams.|`|DCltkysDaa	dunno ....but know you know how frustrating it is...

They're still together, but they each do things to the other that just aren't right. His dad is unsuportive, and disconnected from reality. His mom is an emotional wreck (anger issues, etc.). <br>  <br>  Despite all of that, my husband really does a lot to help our marriage succeed. Honestly, I don't think he knows about the statistics with the money and men in divorce. I didn't before we were married either. We were married when we were young and sort of naive.  If for some strange reason things ever went south on our marriage and couldn't be fixed, I would never go after him financially the way some women do. There's no point. Money doesn't heal hurt feelings.|`|nhZb43pIaa	Lol, what a crock.

There is no way someone wouldn't read them, even if you trusted them.<br>  <br>  This happened to Emily Dickenson who wrote about 1775 poems and her sister swore she would burn them upon death, and her sister went out to sell them all.  Well, her brother found out and stole them back and hid them in Amhearst college, but then years and years later, Thomas Johnson found them and decided to publish "The poems of Emily Dickinson" which is the most famous of all the books.|`|VPAMzE3uaa	I don't know how handy you are, but consider constructing a wooden box with a hinged lid to store your diary.  Add a bottle of ink in a thin glass bottle to the inside of the lid.  Now rig a striker (mouse trap might be easiest) to strike and break the glass when the lid is opened.  Finally, install a hole in which you would push a nail or dowel to prevent the mousetrap from striking the bottle.<br>  <br>  When you open the box, you know you need to add the safety device (nail or dowel) before lifting the lid.  Anyone who doesn't know this will just open the lid, break the ink bottle, and ruin your diary.|`|Oymphw2iaa	I like this question. 5 years ago I found out that my mother was reading all my diaries and I felt so embarrassed and guilty for all the things i wrote in there!

If both parents carry it, then each child has 1 out of 4 chances of being blonde or blue-eyed.<br>  <br>  I find it mildly amusing that you seem to consider one particular genetic result as 'normal.'   I consider 'normal' to be that you have the typical number of fingers and toes and limbs etc.  <br>  <br>  My brother and his wife have jet-black hair, but their only daughter has brilliant red hair.  Her two children by a previous marriage both have very light blonde hair.    <br>  <br>  I think it's wonderful how this kind of variety can pop up.|`|YR78bGIaaa	it doesnt mean when you have blonde mother, you will have blonde hair. if your father also blonde, you must be blonde. but if only one of your parents is blonde while the other one is not, the mixing of genetics trait is the result of you.|`|CBbsulYCaa	Happens a lot. The parents were carrying  recessive blond genes which combine to produce a blond child, but does not show in themselves as they each also have a dominant dark gene.

Those women (if they are even feminists) are hypocrites. Fighting anyone really isn't right, and I don't believe men should throw the first punch. But if a women hits you, she can't be surprised or angry if she gets hit back.<br>  <br>  Women have a right to sex and enjoying their bodies, but I think badly of any person, regardless of gender or age, who would sleep with so many people. I don't think anyone should have sex before 18 and still wait longer if they can, but not necessarily for marriage. Have you ever read Female Chauvinist Pigs by Ariel Levy? She can be really stupid (her latest article in the New Yorker about old separatist communities, for instance) but makes a good case for raunch culture undermining women. I don't see how objectifying ourselves before men do make us equal. But that had more to do with society than feminists. Most old-school feminists are horrified that promiscuity is viewed as women's sexual agency. Women invoke free will as feminism and have confused the platform.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Interesting concept.  Since there are some fundamental biological differences between men and women.  Men are naturally stronger than women in most cases.  So to make things fair, you can hit us back, but kicking you in the nuts (a mans greatest weakness) is no longer considered fighting dirty and is perfectly acceptable. ^_^|`|V1MptCMiaa	I don't in anyway think 15-18 year old CHILDREN should sleep with more than 30 men ever.  And it's disgusting if men sleep with a bunch of women.  But women and men are NOT equally physically strong or built, so already there's no equality in a fight.  Men can do more damage to a woman in a fight because it's already not equal. If it were, a woman could beat the hell out of guy with one hit like a guy can to a woman.  THAT would be equality.

f0JLp4hFaa	Hi Michael,<br>  <br>  At the time, many people found the theory of evolution to be contrary to their interpretation of Biblical (or religious) creation.  This is still true today as some of the answers from anti-scientific religious people demonstrate.  Of course, there were many rational people who didn't think religious creation stories like Genesis made much sense.  Those people embraced Darwin's theory as a revelation of how things really came to be.  And we've seen evolutionary theory grow and "evolve" since Darwin's initial ideas.  With the synthesis with genetics, there is no doubt that evolutionary theory explains how life (including man) evolved from earlier forms.<br>  <br>  Some religious people will deny it, just as some religious people deny that the Earth orbits the Sun, or deny that women and men are equal.  But there's a big difference between "belief" and "fact".  Remember, the definition of "strong faith" is unwavering belief regardless of evidence to the contrary.<br>  <br>  Historically, the "Christianity versus Evolution" debate had its first big  battle in the 1860 Oxford Evolution Debate.  Read the description to get an idea of how evolution and religion interacted back then:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Oxford_evolution_debate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Oxford...</a>|`|EmgiGg17aa	No such thing(evolution)in the eyes of the church.  It twas Adam and Eve having a lot of sex and all carried to full term and natural delivery(over and over and over and over and over and over)   >so that means there was incest but the church won't talk about that end of things<    or there had to be magic involved(again they won't talk about it) but if you think about it - to go from 2 people to 10 -20-or a hundred some "monkeying" around had to happen. <br>     As for Charlie himself, he admitted on his death bed, there must be a creator to have started it.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I'm pretty sure his works were silent on the topic.<br>  <br>  Not every work explicitly addresses religion.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Evolution has no religious views.  Like all of science, it is simply an attempt to explain certain observations (the fossil record, similarities between different species, the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, etc.) in a comprehensive and consistent fashion.<br>  <br>  Science and religion have been in conflict for centuries, and most religions have come to accept scientific discoveries as the supporting evidence becomes overwhelming.  Evolution is accepted as fact by most denominations of the major religions, and the argument against it is driven almost entirely by people who believe it conflicts with the literal interpretation of their holy scriptures.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Azuka:  Where in my answer do I claim to "know" whether or not a supreme being exists?  And what part of my answer represents my "personal beliefs" (as opposed to "personal opinion")?|`|4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	Darwin's TOE was basically a fundamental proposition that God is not necessary.<br>  <br>  Wiiliam Provine <br>  Evolution is the greatest engine of atheism ever invented. <br>  <br>  Naturalistic evolution has clear consequences that Charles Darwin understood perfectly. 1) No gods worth having exist; 2) no life after death exists; 3) no ultimate foundation for ethics exists; 4) no ultimate meaning in life exists; and 5) human free will is nonexistent.    "Evolution: Free will and punishment and meaning in life”  1998  Darwin Day Keynote Address  1  2  <br>  <br>  As the creationists claim, belief in modern evolution makes atheists of people. One can have a religious view that is compatible with evolution only if the religious view is indistinguishable from atheism.    No Free Will  (1999)  p.123 <br>  <a href="http://bevets.com/equotesp5.htm#wprovine" rel="nofollow">http://bevets.com/equotesp5.htm#wprovine</a><br>  <br>  "The modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution is fundamentally inconsistent with any meaningful theism -- with any meaningful God who acts as creator of the world. Now, of course, this isn't necessarily true of all theories of evolution, or of the concept of evolution broadly construed, because a creator could make use of a gradual, long-term process of making one thing out of another just as well as any other process. So there's nothing about the word "evolution" that rules out the creator.<br>  <br>  But the modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, orthodox among today's scientists, insists that evolution is an unplanned, undirected process. It combines elements of chance and necessity or natural law, a combination of random genetic changes or mutations, which accumulate through natural selection. These are impersonal material forces reflecting no preexisting intelligence and no guidance. As the outcome of this process, human beings are essentially unplanned acts of nature."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arn.org/docs/orpages/or161/161main.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.arn.org/docs/orpages/or161/16...</a>|`|XHmz4R99aa	God didn't create humans, animals or any other living thing on earth.<br>  The inhabitants (plans, animal, humans, etc.) of this planet started naturally from a primordial soup and evolved to what it is today.<br>  <br>  In short, God didn't really do what the bible said he did in 7 days.|`|81BTYiWqaa	Its amazing how 2 men who walked around with sheets on their heads now control the minds of half the population of earth!|`|FwuyxxoWaa	The religious views of the theory were mainly to 'dispute' the creationist's view that God made the world in 6 days, and dossed around on the 7th. At the time Darwin was still a Christian, although he did lose his faith eventually. The theory never mentions that 'there is no God', but evolution is used by Atheists as evidence.|`|d2d6d1d2d206350f4858f15ffbfaafa3aa	The first three answers have almost nothing to do with your question.  These answers reflect their personal beliefs.    One of my pet peeves is when a person asks a question and receives an answer to some other question.   (ex. "What time did you get home last night?" - "I was at the movies.")<br>  <br>  I find it amusing that the three answers you've gotten are from people who actually believe the KNOW whether god exists or not and are sure of this knowledge.  In truth, one of the cool things about religious belief in god, is that it is not possible to prove OR disprove god's existence.   I like it this way.<br>  <br>  To answer YOUR question though.  Well,  Darwin's theory of evolution was taken from a scientific perspective and took into account only that which could be seen and measured.  So, the evolution theory was developed without reference to a higher power.     If you look at Darwin's autobiography, you will find out that like most people, his religious beliefs changed over time.   While on the Beagle, he was indeed a christian, but did not allow his personal belief to interfere with his scientific study.<br>  <br>  He never stopped contemplating the meaning of life, and the various religious views held by mankind.  Eventually he became content to live his life as an agnostic.  So, the was not christian at the end, nor was he an atheist.  Instead he was, like many of us, unsure.   Nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  I've heard that faith is a gift.   However, you can't force yourself to have it, and if you have it, you can't force yourself to get rid of it.  Some gift!<br>  <br>  Bottom line - it is good to have an inquiring mind.  Unlike your first three answerers, I believe it is best to not only have a personal theory, but also to be open to the possibility that your theory may be wrong and that you should keep an open mind so that you can tweak, alter, or toss your beliefs.      I think that Darwin and I have this in common.  I have been a Christian, agnostic, atheist, back to Christian, then agnostic and finally a theist, although not Christian.   Will I maintain my current beliefs for the rest of my life?  Who knows?   It's all good.|`|YR78bGIaaa	from view of Islam, it is not true despite human have many similarities with monkey. we cannot conclude that the similarity means monkey is our ancestor, it mean that we came from one god, Allah. thats why His creations share some same traits.

I2cdBxHVaa	I'm going into clinical psychology too. It's the most wonderful career, helping people recover from depression and strokes! <br>  <br>  I studied biology, chemistry, psychology and english lit/lang at college. This meant I could do my first degree in medical neuroscience which was really good because then I had the biological background to understand why psychological disorders happen. This year I am going to do a one year masters course in psychology which will give me the graduate basis for registration (necessary to apply to clinical psychology)<br>  <br>  This pathway is good because clinical psychology is so competative. I was once told that for every 1 place, 20 people apply. The best thing to do is get as much work experience as you can. Write to your local hospital and ask to work on the stroke ward (clinical neuropsychology) Work for Lovaas or another disabled childrens' playscheme (this is so much fun and you get paid to get experience!) work in a local care home for dementia people or in a councelling place for depressed people etc. As much experience in a varied field as you can get. <br>  <br>  I'd also consider doing your first degree in something related as you can use this to your advantage. e.g. I have a neuroscience background so I can understand the biological basis of their stroke and what areas of damage may mean to their psychological health. <br>  <br>  Finally, don't listen to anyone who says psychology isn't a real science. They are uneducated idiots who know nothing. If you are doing a BSc in psychology, it is a science. Make sure any uni course you apply to is accredited by the British Psycological Society and that you will achieve the graduate basis for registration (you can find this out from the uni or on the BPS website) And people who say it isn't a real science will be the stroke victims, or depressed people you will be helping one day! <br>  <br>  A really good book you should get is called "how to become a clinical psychologist" by Alice Knight. - <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Become-Clinical-Psychologist-Getting/dp/1583912428" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Become-Clini...</a> it's a brilliant book
AA10383523	Interesting.  I had a very similar experience a while back.  I was (and still am) very good friend with an attractive girl and thought maybe something was there.  I have known her now for about 10 years and we still get along really well.  I'm actually glad we never slept together since I did with another of my female friends and now she is all weird around me and we aren't as cool as we were.<br>  <br>  Anyway, a lot of girls do date guys that they are not really into and would feel very bad breaking up with them.  If you want to test the water with this girl try joking around with her about this stuff.  For example, (jokingly) act as if you don't know her and are asking her out on a date or to bang or whatnot..."excuse me miss, what's your name?  you're kind of cute, are you married?" then whatever she says, say "cool - what are you doing after you get out of work?"  something like that.  be creative...the key is to do it jokingly but to see her response and go from there.  if she plays along, she is probably thinking what you are thinking. hope that helps.|`|wWcxe0Gpaa	she sounds into you maybe you should get more info on boy <br>  - have they gone out long <br>  -is it serious ...|`|329b61f14c0d934ae2da7015180f71edaa	well if you go out for lunch ask her to come along - if at first there are other people that's fine - takes some pressure off - then go for it and have lunch with her alone - get her to talk about her weekend - that should give you a feel about her boyfriend - find out some places she go - then go there - not to see her but to get a feel for the places she like - that's will give you more in-site about what she likes - let her talk - believe it or not people like to talk about themselves|`|ieTqqgbkaa	Y'all are friends. But honestly, the best relationships come out of friendships, so maybe one of these days if she and her boyfriend aren't together anymore, she'll want you to give her a chance.
CxoogGzxaa	I believe it depends on your age. I recently discussed synesthesia with a friend of mine who is a psychology student, and she told me that synesthesia is caused by extra connections between neurons in your brain, and that it occurs during early childhood. I tried to find out if it can occur later in life, but I couldn't find anything. There are many forms of synesthesia, though it might be that what you are experiencing now is just a form of visually associate certain shapes with certain sounds. <br>  <br>  I have synesthesia myself, I hear otherwise soundless animations. I've had it for as long as I can remember, and I haven't developed any other forms of it later.|`|6GmtcZteaa	hey sweety idk bout this but perhaps you should get yourself checked <br>  x
m7o5A3pDaa	You need to do some backtracking in your head, seriously. Your fascination(I'll just use this euphemism) over rabbits means you have had an event that make you remember rabbits in a rather peculiar or morbid way. Or the rabbits maybe a symbol to your thoughts deep down.<br>  <br>  Try going back, thought series of words and picture memories, to the point where you start having these visions. What was the trigger to this fascination and what were you actually thinking back then. Does anything in a rabbit resemble something you fear?<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, don't try to get the rabbits out of your head, just run right through them and find what breeds all of it in the first place.<br>  <br>  If you find self-taught free association technique futile, seek professional help.

u33x2hqzaa	Liz said it best.  I would just add that comparing yourself to others will never make you happy.  Besides appearances can be deceiving.  Many people who are very active types are driven by an inner dissatisfaction, which isn't not living life to the fullest but it's not necessarily an indication of the level of their happiness either. I've known people who stay busy, travel around the world and have a huge social life because they aren't truly happy in themselves and are scared by the "quiet life."  Filling up your time just to stay busy isn't living life to the fullest in my opinion.  It's running away from yourself and mistaking solitude with loneliness.<br>  <br>  "It's not getting what you want.  It's wanting what you've got."  I think living life to the fullest is about being alive, aware and finding something good about it to appreciate every day.  Different strokes for different folks.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	No, not at all bad, its actually probably good for your blood pressure and stuff like low stress but what i have seen is that most people grow tired of that lifestyle after a while.  all you need to be sure of is that you dont do that to keep yourself 'safe'. do this because you enjoy it and if and when you are sick of this and want to go out and have an adventure do it :) best wishes|`|QjifsTNfaa	If you're happy then that's all that matters. I'm glad that you're life is stable, most twenty five year old girl's lives are so not stable. Just remember, it's not what the general consensus is on "living life to its fullest" that matters. It's what your interpretation of it is. So, if you're content. Be content. If you're not. Go out and explore. There's nothing wrong with being quiet or being adventurous. It all depends on what makes you happy :]|`|AA11832245	No just because you are not sociable with life, that does`nt mean you are not living life to the fullness. Living life to the fullness just means be happy and don`t blow off opportunities. It does`nt matter if you are not like everybody else because that is what makes you unique and different. Life live for yourself, don`t pay attention to what society thinks.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Stop worrying you dont have to be like everyone else to be happy, dont compare your life with others, those with busy and 'full' lives may not necessarily be happy anyway!<br>  <br>  I think its great that you are content...you have realised that happiness is clearly the journey and not the destination.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep on enjoying life x x x
ergI4qQPaa	There is no difference at all, now days the way humans kill each other, abuse and torture others there is no difference left. In fact I think that humans are worse than animals, because they have a more developed brain and all that still they will torture, kill and do things that are beyond imagination.<br>  Did you read that story in the newspapers recently that a daughter got her entire family killed( father, mother, two brothers and their innocent children) just because she was in love with a guy and her family did not approve.Do you think that it is human.<br>  Animals on the other hand are loving, faith full and all the other qualities.<br>  So now you decide|`|AA10835554	I love this question. So take a monkey and place him in the middle of New York. He's not so smart there, but now place him in the jungle, and he becomes super genius. So it depends on where they are. The word human comes from two words, humas meaning earth body, and man meaning spirit. So its the "human" ego saying we are spirits in earth bodies, and the other "animals" are just earth bodies. <br>  <br>  The main difference is that humans have evolved into thought based entities. Animals usually don't think thoughts, and so live in harmony with everything around them. Humans are very strange, because they are in constant resisting to what already is, and this causes stress. If a human is stuck in a traffic jam, they will actually argue that it shouldn't be happening, demanding everything around them to be perfect. An animal would simply accept what is and stay in peace, so you could say they are superior to us in that way. Its funny because if a dog lives with humans long enough, they also start to resist reality and so will become stressed because they can't get off their chain.<br>  <br>  But some humans are actually going beyond thought, or above thought and separating from thought, while only using it when it is needed. They become the watcher of thoughts instead of the thinker of thoughts. On the other hand, many humans go below thought by taking drugs or drinking, and so return to their older primal self. <br>  <br>  So instead of staying lost in thought, and getting our identity from thought, we are moving towards a greater awareness that will bring us out of the dark ages of the mind, and into peace, or heaven on earth as they call it. Sounds good to me.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Human beings can distinguish between right and wrong, we can be selective and choose who we have sex with, we can rationalize, we can be objective and subjective, we can express ourselves through creativity, we can hold a conversation, we can commit, we don't have the need to chew raw hide bones or chew on grass.  We have distinct thought patterns and common sense.|`|WETYSQcfaa	I don't think man and animals are all that different. Evolution made our brains a little bit better and provided us with a thumb and we made use of it. But sadly we are not putting our so called 'superiority' in good use and using it instead for the destruction of our own species. I think we should learn from other animals and try to co-exist with others.|`|rJ1uwS0Yaa	Man is also a social animal.But animals are that creatures of God from where we can learn many important and ideal things from them which are very necessary as well as important for always being a human.|`|TTt51jutaa	Man- has a soul<br>  Animal- doesn't have a soul<br>  <br>  short and simple.|`|NqfUPKiSaa	Human being is also a social animal endowed with discriminating power of brain<br>  It does not seem that he makes use of this function and rather goes egoistic|`|u33x2hqzaa	People have a much greater developed capacity for reason and self-awareness than animals.  Animals have a much greater understanding of their environment and are far more instinctual than people.  Cool question.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Brains.<br>  <br>  Human brains have significantly more specialised areas than animal brains - even large animal brains, like elephants, which allow us more flexibility and more layers of thinking and representations, which lead to language which lead to abstract thought.<br>  <br>  Most animals are also largely "stuck in time, stuck in space" - they don't have autobiographical memories in the same way, they dont perceive/understand past and future. Space is a bit more complicated.<br>  <br>  Animals lack representation of others and empathy. Badgers don't send aid packets to other starving badgers. Animals don't have rules about how to treat each other. Animals do not show mercy, either - if they are prompted to attack they will continue till the threat is gone (the opponant leaves, submitts, etc) or untill the other is dead (well fed greyhound will still tear cats to pieces, well fed cats still hunt). Neither are they as imaginitively nasty as humans, which people tend to idealise, but if we acted like animals, the world would not be better off.<br>  <br>  We are the only immoral animals purely because we are the only animals to create morality.|`|cAbHBCVwaa	"man is just another animal,<br>  sometimes better, more other worse than those that walk on all fours,who because of his "divine spiritual and intellectual development," <br>  has become the most vicious animal of all"|`|uPL3e3tyaa	A human being IS an animal; the only difference between man and beast is the fact that we kill each other over ideology, not for survival or food.|`|ZejwYamhaa	human beings are the only species that has ever lived on the face of this earth that has managed to destroy the world.

Clearly this man triggered some sort of emotional reaction within you, does he resemble someone you know? anything on his face bear some sort of resemblance? it is also possible that this mans imaged was pushed into you long term memory instead of your short term which feels like you've seen him before your unconscious is trying to make sense of it, hence your dreams.

QtCQtXDVaa	I think this man has a fear of commitment. Subconsciously chosen, the long distance relationship means he can postpone serious commitment. By sleeping with others he even more "proves" to himself that "he's not worthy of her". He convinces himself that "if she was the right one, he wouldn't cheat", but fact is, this person has a problem with loving himself enough to share the inside of his heart with anyone. The future is now. Love is not a fairytale. It is a choice and hard work. You get what you give. Find out what makes you feel unworthy of a deep relationship (look at your past, upbringing). Face your fears or you'll be spending the rest of your life wondering why "the right one" never came along...<br>  <br>  Good luck and much love to you|`|5p3m2fdFaa	Hes Obviously Scared Of Commitment Or Hasnt Found The Right One Yet.<br>  If Your In A Relationship, Even If It Is Long Distance, Should You Be Sleeping With Other People?<br>  Or Have I Just Read The Question Wrong :S<br>  xxxxxx|`|cTJa8FZYaa	everyone was born to be with someone. he sounds unhappy.|`|WBgbWmJSaa	huh?|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	Hes obviously just not found the right one|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	He is scared of responsibility

The situation is not the same.  I think the "recession" has been ongoing for 35+ years, but not everyone thinks so.<br>  Anyway, there are many systems in place now that did not exist in '29, but they have not been used very well.  At it's most basic, the situation is the same (idiotic greed cancelling common sense) but the result will be very different because the boom-bust cycle has been muted by modern economic institutions' way of doing things, and the laws that are supposed to guide them away from absolute crazy behavior.<br>  I am hoping for one huge difference: America learning something from this.<br>  The Green Party has spoken.

There is more information encoded on an X chromosome. Therefore, since women have 2 X chromosomes, they are better than men! A woman with XXX syndrome is even more superior than normal women! <br>  Since the information is duplicated by having 2 of the same sex chromosome, having an X and a Y chromosome would bestow even more greatness than ONLY having one X chromosome! Therefore, men are superior to normal women, but not nearly as superior as men with XXY syndrome! The are soooo much better than us guys with ONLY an X and a Y! The epitome of greatness and superiority are the "men" with XXXXY syndrome. They have the superiority of a man, woman, and another half of a woman all combined!!! Oh how I wish I could be at least an XXY male. Oh what fun that would be, being so superior...<cough><br>  Wait a sec! I thought I was "proving" the super-great-superiority of the WOMAN! All bow down to the redundancy of X chromosomes!!!<br>  <br>  You are sort of an embarrassment to all men, no offense. Stop flagellating yourself, men are no worse or better than women.

dd0cf2b4af187b2e42eeec11aa2f45dcaa	It was nice when I was preg but after i had the baby I was sooo tired and ill i wanted everything to go back to normal and to have some time alone with my baby and my own space; i had to check myself out of hospital. It so much nicer now peace and quiet but i still get the odd stranger coming up and touching my baby! we all knew it want going to last anyway!|`|9q2RmVHRaa	Sadly my husband wasn't very attentive.  I work full time and with all three children I worked up to a month before giving birth.  I was tired of being pregnant and yes more people would open doors for you, but I don't miss anything.  I'm happier having the baby than having the attention of being pregnant.  Regardless your exhausted both ways and I don't want to be fussed over, I was happy to be left alone to take care of the baby.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	I don't feel that I received any special attention when I was pregnant,or when my daughter was first born.  I hated being pregnant, I felt fat had to wear these ugly maternity clothes and could hardly bend over.  I was glad to get back to normal after she was born.  I never missed having a new baby, because there was always something new going on with her, learning to walk and talk then starting school.  There is just always something new to keep looking forward to.|`|IwvszgPdaa	that is very true. my eldest was as at school when i had my 2nd baby. i had lots of attention in the school playground when pregnant and even more after the birth. 2 weeks later ??? where were they all ??, not even so much as a hello, just a nod when i passed them. i did like the attention as it makes you feel special at the time but i'm really not that bothered about it - they werent friends to begin with, just other parents at the school so no loss really.|`|oNPlRuSOaa	Once this stops you have time and oumph! to create a special bond with your baby - away from mothers in law etc and their way of bringing up children. Don't forget you will have to re- discover the world through your baby's eyes and help him/her grow in every way. It's a great adventure - enjoy!|`|2COaydcfaa	usually to tired in the months after birth to care.|`|un0C52G8aa	I enjoyed that people were willing to help at first but after a while, I got tired of it.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Not really. I've got the baby and that's way cooler than getting special attention. And if I need help now and then I've got it, so I'm okay.<br>  <br>  Besides, I'm usually too tired to care anyways. lol|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  lol I agree with answers above!<br>  <br>  The special attention you get when pregnant is wonderful, for some a magical time. <br>  <br>  Most find that they find a lot of pride in others then giving that attention to their baby when it arrives as it makes them know that their baby is perfect.<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	No, I suppose mainly because I was too ill during my pregnancies to even notice any "special" attention.  I had morning sickness for nine months, my first husband was only too happy to leave it all up to me, I had tremendous backache, had to work and was too tired and miserable.  <br>  After the baby was born I was probably too involved with the baby to notice much, anyway.  <br>  By the time your baby is old enough, you start making friends with other young mums and so your life goes on.<br>  So I can't say I noticed any special attention.  I would love to have more babies though, because that is wonderful, not the attention from other people.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Honey, I had 3 babies in a 5 year span.   I didn't have TIME to think about it.  Sure, I was pampered during the first pregnancy, because as a couple, we had no other responsibilities.  <br>  <br>  I suppose the answer lies in the individual woman and her temperament.  An introverted person would probably welcome being left alone.  An extroverted person would miss the conversation and feel lonely.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	to be honest i really don't remember ever thinking of myself......once the kids came it was all about them........and is to this day and now with grandchildren the focus is on them........i believe that women who do miss the attention are so-what selfish and self centered and (no scientific proof) but seem to more prone to Postpartum depression....just my observation so don't blow a gasket|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I didn't miss the attention on myself.

The focus goes from "can you believe this" to "can you believe ME". You are being manipulated without knowing it. You don't need to believe a person, what you need is to judge every word you hear at it's basic core. In other words, I don't care if you believe me! Because I lie! Yep, I lie. No, not all the time and I really can't remember the last lie I've told (there's another one lol) but, my focus is trying to get you to see what I see in a certain subject. We all tell fabrications at one time or another. Little white lies, exaggerations, half truths, etc... So the only way to truly have balance is to judge the subject not the person. Now if the person is a constant fabricator, then yeah, it's probably not a good idea to jump at every word as truth.  <br>  <br>  What you are doing is trying to paste a bad character trait of negativity (and that's not a bad trait all the time) to the bad character trait of lying. Both are completely different. I have a person on our creative problem solving team that is the epitome of negativity. Yet we need her! She keeps us from crashing head long at mach 5 into the proverbial brick wall. By slowing down the process we see hurdles that we've missed and would have certainly stumbled over. Negativity is not always a bad thing. Especially if it is being misdiagnosed with the character trait of distrust!|`|bchci2Dkaa	No, I used to have a "friend" who was like that, and I unknowingly formed a codependent friendship with him because that was how he was with everyone.

This is not totally unusual.  Many young and older people get intimidated around strangers or older people.   The easy answer is to just relax.  Try not to say too much, until you feel more comfortable with someone new.  Try to be a better listener.  Then respond to what that person is saying.  Take small steps first.  You may need some help down the line.  Talk to your parents.  I'm sure they will work with you.  God Bless You!|`|AzME6jxNaa	your insecure
AA10835554	Most people make the mistake of measuring success by fame, money, family or health, but true success is finding peace, meaning no mental pain. This is all that really matters, and ultimately what they are trying to find through those things, but never do. As soon as they get what they wanted, something else comes up that makes them unhappy. Take the incident with Chris Brown and Rhianna for example. <br>  <br>  One would think that mental pain is normal, and it is, but that doesn't mean has to be that way. Peace comes from the inner self, not thoughts, or things, but knowing that you are the awareness behind those things, and shifting your identity from form to the formless awareness that you are. Its not religion, but a knowing that takes the place of a reaction.|`|bchci2Dkaa	How smoothly things ran for the successful deed to happen.

Cost, water tables, coal for fuel etc.  all ridiculous and negative comments.  Of cousrse this can be done and the sooner the better.  Im not going to go into why its such a good idea because you already know.

The premise seems to be that having as little impact as possible on the environment makes it 'better.'<br>  <br>  I wouldn't know how to begin to answer this question as there is some impact whether you live above ground or below.     I doubt that living below ground would free up land for agriculture and parks as this would only work if people lived SO FAR below the surface that they would be living underneath fields and parks.   Where would kids play?  How would people get enough exposure to sunlight, the absence of which creates significant health problems.<br>  <br>  The environment just is.  It has no feelings or thought.   The earth has been around for billions of years.  During that time the environment has changed dramatically from age to age.   Ice ages come and go, average temperature rises and drops.  By the way, we are currently in the middle of the most recent ice age.  Ice age is defined as a period in which there are polar ice caps.   <br>  <br>  What I'm getting at is that there is no 'normal' environment on this planet.  There is just what we are accustomed to.  But the environment, just as all the species, is constantly evolving to something else.  It will do so whether we live underground or above-ground.   <br>  <br>  It's in our best interest to keep things reasonably clean.   We've done a remarkable job in cleaning things up over the last 30 years.<br>  <br>  And remember, we are all animal species as well.  WE are PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT.  That's something that a bunch of wackos seem to forget.|`|EmgiGg17aa	I don't think underground is a place to be in a flood(New Orleans).   The trees that built the houses come from above ground.  We are just switching places with the cut down forest.<br>    You will have plenty of time to discover the value of underground living when you are "dead".<br>     If you are underground, why are you looking for daylight?<br>  We would also need vehicles with a digging apparatus in front (for we cannot travel on the surface to the underground supermarket).<br>     Why too would you need to get your laundry white and clean(when it is going to get dirty right away)?

One wall would face south and have a huge window. Its power would be from a combination of wind and solar panels. Obviously I am talking about a hillside residence here. Water would be held in a storage tank, fresh air via ventilation shafts and fans. Waste water would go directly to a reed pond where it would be converted to fresh water.

It would be warm in deep winter and cool in hot summer, so no electricity bills.<br>  I have though of burying some shipping containers, cutting doors and windows in them and putting earth on top. You could park your car on top, it would have only two entrances for security, with a glass house to the south of it you could have very cheap living.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	What about radon gas? Flooding? The environmental impact? <br>  <br>  Building a stick house is relatively green in that the wood can be regrown and upkeep is fairly easy. With an underground dwelling (say dig a pit and pour concrete) you have more stress, more sealing and less green.Adding on would be a major pain.
NYU37jfGaa	I think they do.  I constantly read extraordinary statements on here like 'women weren't allowed to work' 'women weren't taught to read' 'women never did anything except cook and clean' etc etc.<br>  <br>  Part of it seems to be based on a misunderstanding of what 'work' meant for most of history.  The rigid divide between home and workplace that is considered normal now was not normal in the pre-industrial era, when the world of home and work overlapped far more than they do now, and women's role was as vital to the economic survival as the man's was.<br>  <br>  It is also based, it seems to me, on a misunderstanding about what being a housewife consisted of in the pre-industrual era, when women were required to have a multitutde of complex skills that are quite staggering to any modern reader.<br>  <br>  And there were plenty of educated women, and women who managed to achieve positions of power and influence desite the handicap of being female.  That the achievements of these women are routinely dismissed by people who ought to know better is a source of continual surprise to me.<br>  <br>  There are loads of good books on women in history, and really there is no excuse for this widespread ignorance among women who ought to know better.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	I wouldn't say that they deny it, exactly, but I do feel that they misinterpret it.  The problem is that, even though Marxism has been discredited virtually everywhere else, it still exerts a powerful influence on feminism.  Consider how many scholars proudly call themselves "Marxist-feminists," for example.  Viewing the present world, as well as history, through a Marx-tainted lens, they naturally come up with a very distorted picture.<br>  <br>  Obviously, both the oppression of AND the achievements of women are worthy of historical research.  Neither should be omitted.  The goal of everyone who studies the present, or the past, should be to get as close to the truth as possible.  One simply cannot do that while lugging around a heavy, ideological axe to grind.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I answered a question like this here:<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsWMQF8FWm7jnaEkU8EUZ.vty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225065433AA0V7op&show=7#profile-info-jk0rAkEjaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I think that feminism, for a long time, has been seen as a White woman's issue.  I'm pretty sure that Black women were laughing at the middle to upper class White women whining about the right to work, since we'd been working outside the home for decades.  I think that Feminism has been Eurocentric, but things have changed in recent years.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	I find the whole notion of "oppression" to be terribly conspiratorial and flawed in any case. I truly believe the separate spheres in life for men and women arose naturally out of good hearted intentions and what was seen as the best lifestyle for men and women at the time, a time when women did not have contraception, birth control or concrete abortion methods or sanitary products for menstruation. They could not have been comfortably liberated in the eighteenth century. It only transmuted over the centuries so that it became oppression when technologies advanced but people wanted to cling on to an archaic lifestyle that was no longer tenable and then brought women down.But it was never a scornful patriarchy that imposed horrendous things on women which the feminist movement likes to portray.<br>  <br>  I don't think it discredits the achievements of women. I think in actuality it makes their achievement all the more impressive and exceptional. But could you provide some sources for your question? What women? Just out of curiosity?|`|phJfL2wTaa	I don't think it is outright denial.<br>  It appears to be selective history.<br>  <br>  Ignore or deny anything that may contradict what you want to believe,<br>  and promote the slices of history that confirm what you want to believe.<br>  <br>  I think it is human nature to do this to a degree, it has happened though out history (or has it?). Think about the changes in the history book used in schools, they have changed dramatically.  I don't think the history books are more accurate or inaccurate, the difference is what information is considered important and what is left out.<br>  <br>  Because today the average citizen has far more access to information than any time in history, creating selective history is more difficult to achieve and is thus more apparent to the average citizen.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	Women's history is humankind's history. <br>  <br>  But if a separate history for women be needed, that history should certainly not be written by feminists. It should be written by ordinary women.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I believe that most history is BUNKUM. It is centred upon kings and queens not upon ordinary people.|`|L0Jrx5anaa	The feminists do many things that don't help in any way. They made it seem like women couldn't do anything then and now they try to make women entirely equal to the point where they should pay on dates and all of that. None of it was really thought through and personally looking at some of the major feminists that we looked at in sociology it makes me think that some women really do need to stay at home because I don't think they are smart enough to work and not kill the business. But that isn't true for all women.|`|AXNowGPyaa	The problem here is that you are trying to put serious issues into an actual context, rather than cramming them into alignment with an academic ideology of victimization. For contemporary, non-victimized, privileged academic hacks it is essential that the spectre of all those oppressions be treated as existential concerns, pressing hard into the very moment, for this is the only way their really very vapid ideas could gain any institutional power.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	I think your question is valid and ok, it's a new angle, bit different than mine, I accept much of history, but would be more open to Her-story....there is none and we women need to start making some versions of history known from a female point of view.<br>  Something for you to think about ...last paragraph below<br>  <br>  Boy what an Oxymoron this is in more ways than one.....<br>  <br>  The word women's and history ( "his-story") clash.

So by pointing it out, feminists are trying to correct this, rather than collude with it.<br>  <br>  I do not think that a reading of history does undermine the oppression of women, as any powerful or important women are generally the exception rather than the rule.  I also don't believe that there were many female physicians as the rise of the medical industry in the 1800s was accompanied by a rise of women being barred from education and attending medical college.  I believe the first women were admitted around the late 19th century, so they simply wouldn't have been able to be doctors before then.  <br>  <br>  I accept your points that many feminist movements have originated from middle class women - however they also fought for the rights of working class women (right to equal pay) and upper class women (right to vote and stand for election).  It could be said that feminism is focused on the interests of white western women, but then that is true of men's humans rights movements also, which originated mainly amongst middle class white men.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully the idea is that rights for one group of women, evolves into rights for all groups of women, regardless of ethnicity, country or lifestyle.  So whilst black feminism is very interesting as a theory, I still believe that mainstream feminism benefits all women in the rights that it secures.  It may be that non-white, non-middle class, non western women have different concerns, but they're probably still pretty glad of the rights that feminism has secured for them - I've never heard any woman say they don't want the right to vote, pay, etc, regardless of what else they may think about the feminist movement  :-)<br>  <br>  Edit - lichen - I appreciate that there were many females working in the then medicine industries, but to be honest, most 'medicine' prior to the enlightenment was something akin to superstition.  Women have always been midwives, true, but women have always died in childbirth, whereas this is much more rare in modern hospitals.  So I don't deny that women did it, but that they did it to much great accomplishment, I do doubt.  It's not a co-incidence that we get the words 'quacks' from dubious medicinal pre-modern history.  The acclaim of physicians, for me, begins with the rise of the profession as a science, from which women were barred, as I stated, until the late 19th century  :-)|`|uXqDYPNVaa	No, feminists often use famous women in history to bolster their points that oppression of women is senseless, since it's clear that not all of them are as weak and inept as some others would have everyone believe then.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No one can deny history, even women's history; we just look at it differently. Let's say; for example, one woman will say women have been oppressed and look for points to enhance her viewpoint, while the other claims they have not been and looks for viewpoints to enhance her viewpoint.<br>  When in truth people are the greatest culprits of oppression.<br>  We have our wars, starvation, famine, pestilence, racial tension, animal abuse and all other abuses. At times we don't treat each other right.<br>  Well, that's my say.
IpD7Gqieaa	I'd say TV doesn't spoil you because I'd I did, it won't be generalized. I mean who says watch stupid mind numbing programs? Tv is not entirely bad, I say the misuse of it is bad. For example if parents let their children watch cartoons or NICE shows with a limited time they won't be spoiled. But parents that don't even CARE what their children are watching, then that's dangerous. Because see, there's a lot of violence on now be it news, blah, adult shows whatever. <br>  So just control your mind haha that's what I would say. Btw I know some couch potatoes too. I could go on an on.|`|trMsK86jaa	Other than leaving them with an impression that people their age and from their generation are generally amiable people?<br>  <br>  Srsly, it makes you think of everyone as being all chummy and friendly, and then you realise your life is NOT an episode of cheers.|`|VcGnf0WMaa	sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't.|`|2b29b0ccc6132900eac4cce101b3d73daa	Why do you just have one channel .|`|ygbVWNTXaa	Everything we experience, including television, become part of our perception and interpretation of life. Whatever you "feed" your mind on will grow, whether its true or not, your mind simply receives the data as input. Verifiable truth can purify, or clear up false perceptions. Ever wonder why there are so many opinions on any chosen subject? Because everyone's life experience is different, opinions are a reflection of perceptive belief. To define that which is truth, to offer clarity, you'll need to do some reading that will "pay off" in a major way to your life experience. How would you like to know how to create your future? This is reality, the "Laws of Attraction", are God's universal laws, much like the laws of gravity. I will give you that much because its entirely too much to explain. Consider these references: David R Hawkins-Power vs Force and Truth vs Falsehood, Rhonda Byrne-The Secret ( book or movie), or Jerry Hicks-The Law of Attraction. There are many authors on the subject these were the best I've been introduced to. You apparently have an acute awareness, with this information as you have observed, while your friends are wasting their minds you will progress in life. By doing this you will also have the oppurtunity by example, to guide them. Keep in mind, like your computer, whatever you download becomes retreivable data, its in there, much of exposure contains a virus, it downloads quickly, but the mess your stuck with afterwards can take years of reprogramming. Blessings,|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Most definitely it is, see with all these programs comes perception & with perception comes reality now if you can alter that perception & allow the viewer to see only what you choose & pick they see then you can have that person feel or believe how you want them to believe YES it is a mind control device|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	I don't think so.<br>  The majority of us are pretty sane.
E5eZn9rcaa	Sort of. Since I went to college I had no self-esteem after years of never having a boyfriend and having a mom who has a problem with my weight and acne (being too gangly, looking too pale, looking too tired, etc. etc.) to the point where she scolds me and announces that she'll stuff me with oranges and take away our weeks' rations of chocolate or mayonnaise, or something random like that.<br>  <br>  So if a guy actually looks like he's appreciating my image, at least I'd feel better about myself.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	I think most women are flattered when a man checks them out, it is a silent compliment. As long as it does not become aggressive or an obsession with them its ok.  I also think most men are flattered when a woman checks them out too.  Just because you check someone out it does not mean that you want them or are obsessed with them, your just letting them know you like what you see.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	I do because I should. I have spent some time thinking about the decrepit cadaver I will eventually become, rotting away in a grave for eternity so It is nice "to gather ye rosebuds while ye may".

It is human nature and instinct.I would be worried if nobody at all found me attractive. So I think I appreciate it really only in a very nostalgic sense, as though I am looking back at my youth and telling my grandchildren what a "fox" I used to be. Its definitely an experience. I do not like it if it is a lecturer or something as they appear not to be listening to my ideas for my thesis but checking me out which is a real irritant.|`|pus08YEOaa	No. It always angers me.

There are three passions in my life, my music, my family and my farm. If people want to look at me I am not affected negatively or positively because honestly I just don't care. I don’t like playing games, I don’t like being in awkward situations and I don’t like pretending I give two hoots when I don’t. <br>  <br>  I have a great guy, my band, a good job and a wonderful family; if someone wants to look at me they can. But in all honesty it doesn’t mean anything to me.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	What do you mean 'secretly'? - Women enjoy nothing more than this, and it is no secret. What do you think women take the time to put so much effort into their 'assets' for in the first place?|`|C4bxnKDXaa	Well...men enjoy it too!

NmQCYizTaa	Men are more controlled by hormones as they are ALWAYS affected by testosterone (though some more than others) but it is more obvious that women are affected by hormones as we have ups and downs, and different sex hormones (again though, some less than others.)<br>  <br>  It depends on the person, really.<br>  <br>  But I honestly dont think you can argue for one sex's logic over another's, it's just speculation. Women are more emotional, sure, but that is not contrary to logic, most of the time it sidles with it - for example, being negatively affected by cruelty gives more motivation to help deal with it. Being able to dissasociate from emotions makes war and things more possible, which isn't actually a good thing now, is it?! But then obviously, occasionally women can be irrational. So it evens out. Men can be too heartless, women can have too much emotion.|`|pus08YEOaa	Men are easily swayed by testosterone to be angry and horny. Most of them aren't "logical" in a sense greater than women. Men are socially conditioned that it is unacceptable to cry, but plenty do. If men were allowed to express all the emotions they feel, they wouldn't have the highest rates of suicide.<br>  <br>  That being said, we're controlled by hormones differently but to no greater or lesser degree. Humans as individuals have control over hormones. I think women like to use their hormones as an excuse when it's not the case.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your question is flawed.|`|DtILThwAaa	I don't know why some one would say men and women are affected the same way by hormones. Get educated primate.<br>  Women are a lot more emotional, and can be less rational than men in general, and this is after you subtract the extremes not representative of each gender as a whole i.e. everyone in prison etc.<br>  <br>  The person up two forgets to mention that more women attempt suicide than men. And is it that hard to believe many men simply don't need to cry like women do, without making up over analyzed alternate explanations like social conditioning. What about evolutionary conditioning that favored a brain in a man that could kill in war or for food which requires a lack of emotion compared to women. Maybe women are conditioned to be too emotional and don't conform to our norm. It always has to be their way.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Testosterone in a man is pretty constant throughout the month, though fluctuates during the day (and possibly seasonally). Testosterone gives energy and libido (and makes rodents aggressive). <br>  <br>  In contrast, in women estrogen and progesterone (as well as other hormones) fluctuate dramatically over the month, essentially crashing just before menstruation. Many people say this explains PMT and general mood changes in women.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	I think to an extent.  I think that women's hormones fluctuate so much more than men's that it probably does affect women more than men.  I don't think that is a good excuse to use for sever mood swings though.  If a woman is really moody or unhappy there is probably another reason for this.|`|trMsK86jaa	Psychologically, it is possible to override the hormones at some risk to the person's mental security.<br>  <br>  Possible.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	Having never been a mans' body I couldn't possibly say. But my hormones do very much effect me and my mood|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Hormones - male / female or generic such as Insulin control us all equally. <br>  <br>  Men are just as controlled by their hormone levels as woman are!<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|I1w0HfQbaa	It controls women more than it controls men. The ol' Haagen Daz company profit margins will vouch for me on this occasion. Haagen Daz ice cream+women's hormones=five pounds added to your waistline. Why can't you women after a break-up with a man instead of Haagen Daz ice cream just have a nice, spicy hearty Mexican meal? Us men can control our hormones: when testoterone takes over us we just drink a couple o' brews at the Bar and argue insignificant football facts with other guys.|`|wRLidVqkaa	I don’t think hormones control anyone! I believe people have will power and those who prefer not to use it allow their emotions to control them. <br>  <br>  It is fine to let someone know when they are shitting you, or if you have the blues; if you are randy etc…. But once it becomes your driving force it’s controlling you and you are not controlling them. Hormones from both sexes are equally disruptive if people don’t have the motivation to control their primal urges and instead work through them and confront them head on bluntly and logically.<br>  <br>  Edit: John S do you have any idea how we retain most of our natural instincts? There are receptors in our brain that have been hardwired to our environments and natural surroundings. So not every person is going to fit nice and tight in a package all black and white. Not every human being has the same experience although we start with the same pattern.

cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Reality. However, fantasy is necessary! Fantasy allows us to stretch our comfort zones, our boundaries, our sense of adventure! Reality gives us a concrete foundation and fantasy gives us wings to see higher. Most people will tell you fantasy is a bad character experience. And it's been this way for eons! Back in the early sailing days the map makers would sketch demons, sea serpents, evil monsters, at the edges of undiscovered territory. Trying to scare those sailors from stretching their boundaries. It has never changed. We keep hearing "live in the here and now" and stop day dreaming. If we stretch our imagination too far..... well "there be dragons there"!|`|GfNVcq7Naa	To live in reality likes it's a fantasy would be great, but to live in a fantasy likes it's reality is not.|`|d9kMFVgSaa	fantasy....anything can happen an unhappen|`|iAM3gctWaa	Wouldn′t it be great if fantasies (good ones) were realities.|`|iua4sWSsaa	What's best is when fantasy becomes reality.

As far as I'm concerned, you are not considered a human being until you have a functional brain, and in the first three months of pregnancy, there is obviously no functional brain to speak of.  Abortion, at least in the first three months, is about as immoral as having your tonsils or appendix removed.  So you can't just shout "murder!  murder!" because you have absolutely no proof that life begins at conception.|`|NmQCYizTaa	Do you know what pro-choice even means? It doesn't mean pro-abortion, it means we're leaving other people's buisness to themselves (THEIR choice.)

Nothing outside of you can give you peace, so look inward for freedom. <br>  <br>  So take a deep breath, and let everything get really quite. Now wait and listen for a thought to come in, and it will. Listen for any thought like, "This isn't working", or "I don't hear anything". Those are thoughts. Notice that you don't ask for the thoughts, they just come in, and you are the watcher, or the awareness behind the thoughts. The more you practice this, the more you separate from the thoughts, and the more peace you have. Don't try to change or fight the thoughts, but just allow them to be as they are, and watch. Notice how unrealistic they are, or how they are designed to make you feel bad. Separate and you will be free.<br>  <br>  You may also have a chemical imbalance so you may need a temporary prescription to help you. The chemical imbalance isn't what makes you depressed, but its the thoughts that follow the imbalance. Take your thoughts off autoplay, and take back control.<br>  <br>  For more information go to <a href="http://eckharttolle.com" rel="nofollow">http://eckharttolle.com</a><br>  <br>  He had a similar story to yours.|`|ZQlW9Oeiaa	Yeah life does suck sometimes. But maybe if you try new things you'll meet new people who you could end up caring about and be friends with. Try pretending to be happy, sometimes just pretending will change your thought and next thing you know you'll actually be happy. It's worked for me. You should try therapy if you keep having suicidal thoughts. You have to remember that compared to you, other people have much worse problems, like not having a home, no food, no water and be thankful that you have those things. They still pull through the day working hard for like no money. You're lucky compared to them.
AcgDcQG0aa	The government can certainly bail out ordinary people like that for a while.  <br>  <br>  But the money can't be recycled like that indefinitely.  Because the government doesn't have any of its own money.  The government has to either borrow the money from investors who expect to be repaid in full and with interest.  Or the government has to collect the money through taxes.<br>  <br>  People can live on borrowed money only for so long, before it's time to repay.  And repaying debts while paying for present living expenses is more difficult than just paying for present expenses without any debts.<br>  <br>  And for this reason, imprudent borrowing and spending can make the economy much worse than before.|`|ZlU7yIKuaa	I feel the same way you do, but you have to ask your self the one question that no one is asking? If the government gives out the money to each working American, what and how will they pay it back? That’s the big question here you have to think like a business if you loan someone money you want it back with a little more, the country need to adopted this would be willing to pay back the loan and the Interest? Then you would have to ask yourself how would you back the loan? and with what would you be backing the loan with?<br>  <br>  I believe the answer in right in front of our face, but it would take a lot to pull it off and yes the rich would get richer but the middle class and all those willing to work would be better off now and this melt down and this country would be will better off in the long run.   <br>  <br>  Oh yeah my plane gives each working an American $60,000 over the next 15 Years with either $15,000 or $30,000 up front right now and the rest every three year’s for.   I think there’s a way out of this but yes it would leave some people behind, just those people looking for a free ride and willing not to work.|`|4Vchxp32aa	in the short-run, we can just throw money at the problem.  the thing is, the reason we are in a deep recession is because people are pessimistic.  that's the reason.  not the banks or anything like that.  the things may have caused us to be pessimistic.  however, recall the butterfly affect, no one can honestly say a butterfly caused the recession!

I've noticed that short but not Intense eye contact or a double take is the most comfortable. It means They get me or they want me to get them This is usually during an introduction or a hand shake. Long eye contact is usually means a dominant stand and attentive but too long could also mean there's a threat attached to it or predator (in my case). No eye contact means They don't care to acknowledge me. And then there is the three blinks which means lying and then there is the short eye (if at all) contact with lowered and side to side look like a caged animal with nowhere else to turn. I should be very worried about this person because they are not focused on the now, there is something else brewing inside them. <br>  If you mean what you say you should not be afraid to look into there eyes (even just to see for yourself what they really mean).

mVTGl6HGaa	The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), is the statutory body established for proper planning and co-ordinated development of the technical education system in India. It was established in November, 1945. Currently, there are 1,346 engineering colleges in India approved by the All India Council of Technical Education with a seat capacity of 4,40,000.<br>  <br>  All the major Engineering, Pharmacy and MBA colleges are affiliated with AICTE. The prominent exceptions are B. Tech. courses from Indian Institute of Technology (IITs), ICFAI and BITS, Pilani.<br>  <br>  The AICTE has its Headquarters in Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, Indraprastha Estate, New Delhi, which has the offices of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the Member Secretary.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>  [edit] Objectives<br>  <br>  [edit] The AICTE Act of 1987<br>  <br>  AICTE is vested with statutory authority for planning, formulation and maintenance of norms and standards, quality assurance through school accreditation, funding in priority areas, monitoring and evaluation, maintaining parity of certification and awards and ensuring coordinated and integrated development and management of technical education in the country as part of the AICTE Act No. 52 of 1987.<br>  <br>  The AICTE Act, stated verbatim reads:<br>  <br>      To provide for establishment of an All India council for Technical Education with a view to the proper planning and co-ordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country, the promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system and for matters connected therewith.<br>  <br>  [edit] Current Objective<br>  <br>  In order to improve upon the present technical education system, the current objectives is to modify the engineering curriculum as follows:<br>  <br>     1. Greater emphasis on design oriented teaching, teaching of design methodologies, problem solving approach.<br>     2. Greater exposure to industrial and manufacturing processes.<br>     3. Exclusion of outmoded technologies and inclusion of the new appropriate and emerging technologies.<br>     4. Greater input of management education and professional communication skills.<br>  <br>  [edit] AICTE Bureaus<br>  <br>  The AICTE comprises nine Bureaus, namely:<br>  <br>      * Faculty Development (FD) Bureau<br>      * Undergraduate Education (UG) Bureau<br>      * Postgraduate Education and Research (PGER) Bureau<br>      * Quality Assurance (QA) Bureau<br>      * Planning and Co-ordination (PC) Bureau<br>      * Research and Institutional Development (RID) Bureau<br>      * Administration (Admin) Bureau<br>      * Finance (Fin) Bureau<br>      * Academic (Acad) Bureau<br>  <br>  For each Bureau, Adviser is the Bureau Head who is assisted by technical officers and other supporting staff. The multidiscipline technical officer and staff of the Council are on deputation or on contract from various Government Departments, University Grants Commission, academic institutions etc.<br>  <br>  [edit] Controversies<br>  <br>  [edit] ISB<br>  <br>  Although Indian School of Business has been repeatedly rated as one of the best in the world, it has not been recognized by the AICTE. On paper this is because the flagship courses at the institute run for less than a year's time and do not award any official degrees. However Premchand Palety, director of Centre for Forecasting & Research (C-fore), says that this has been intentional on the part of ISB:<br>  <br>      If ISB is not keen on getting AICTE approval, it has a valid reason. It doesn’t want to lose the flexibility in running its programme.[1]<br>  <br>  [edit] CFA Institute<br>  <br>  In May 2007, upon being approached by ICFAI requested AICTE to investigate the nature of the CFA program run by the CFA Institute of USA: whether it is a "technical education" or not. Shortly thereafter AICTE served notice to the CFA Institute to cease its Indian operations. CFA Institute in turn believes that<br>  <br>      High Court order only states that “it is considered appropriate to direct the respondent authorities to examine the veracity of the allegations brought to the notice of this Court.” Thus, the Gauhati High Court has only directed the AICTE to determine whether CFA Institute must seek approval for our CFA Program from the AICTE. [2]<br>  <br>  Numerous other observers question the validity of AICTE's actions in view of<br>  <br>     1. ICFAI's stand off with the CFA Institute [3]<br>     2. CFA Institute's reputation of being a leading provider of education in the field of financial analysis (it was established in 1947)<br>     3. The CFA program not fitting the criteria needed for a foreign institute to require AICTE approval (it does not conduct any classroom programs: it simply provides study materials and conducts examinations)<br>  <br>  [edit] Shri Balwant Institute of Technology<br>  <br>  AICTE has been charged with alleged nepotism in the case of Shri Balwant Institute of Technology, Sonepat. Although there were no allegations of any improper conduct, it was noticed that the expan

What is new is the mortgage backed securities the banks were trading between themselves and counting as part of their reserve requirement which are leveraged at 30-to-1 so a 1% uptick in the number of people who default on their mortgages results in a 30% decrease in the value of these things.<br>  <br>  Banks find themselves a lot poorer then they once were, which means they lend less.  Most businesses rely on banks lending to for their operations (e.g. retailers will take out a short term loan to buy inventory and pay it back when they sell it) so a decrease in the amount of lending sinks a lot of businesses, which makes people poorer which lowers their spending which sinks even more businesses, &c.|`|N9VWMIFxaa	The Mayan Calendar called this perfectly!

There ain't nothin' up there. <br>  <br>  "Lysistrata" was a play written by a Greek man.
