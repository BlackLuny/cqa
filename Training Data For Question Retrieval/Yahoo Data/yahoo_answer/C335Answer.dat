j2yhjBDiaa	The Neverending Story all the way!  I looooved Atreyu & his horse!|`|tLI94qWNaa	The neverending story because I grew up watching that movie and the story is amazing.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Gotta say Neverending Story. There was too much about Legend that just didn't make sense. They had the opportunity to create this entire fantasy world and culture, but they didn't and it just has no depth at all. Although I do like unicorns. But Neverending Story created an actual fantasy world with various cultures. And the Luck Dragon is to this day one of my favorite fantasy characters.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	Neverending Story TOTALLY!!!!! I can watch Neverending Story now and enjoy it. Legend is a bit slow. I never heard of it until a few years ago and maybe I could see it being okay if I watched it when I was younger but it doesn't compare to Neverending Story or even Princess Bride which was another movie I saw back when.<br>  <br>  Neverending Story had that scary wolf G'mork. Great special effects. Great music (i just bought Neverending story song on amazon. lol) I loved the scene at the end with the bullies vs Sebastion and the luck dragon.<br>  <br>  ummmmm, it's funny how the biggest star in Legend doesn't promote that movie nor does really anyone else (sorry Legend fans! =) no offense) but Neverending story is on I love the 80s. ohhhh and that scene where atreyu has got to run through those statues. That was so scary back then (seeing the dead knight's face). And anyway there's a band by his name to.|`|52pZj3WFaa	Damn!! GREAT question!<br>  <br>  On the one hand, Legend has some great themes and is quite sexy. Very romantic, too, with the eternal struggle and all.<br>  <br>  And The Never Ending Story is just FAB!!<br>  <br>  oooh, I'd have to say...Legend. Because of the age old story of good vs evil.|`|iQjS2lJ4aa	The neverending story definitely!<br>  <br>  I watched it when it was on again a couple of weeks ago, I still bawled when Artex sank in the swamps of sadness. (Im 30 now..) :(|`|relafzK4aa	Dam good question! The Neverending Story will always be apart of my childhood. Great characters and even better storyline. <br>  Legend was also a great movie in fact I still own both of them!<br>  Tim Curry's voice for the character Darkness was perfectly executed<br>  especially that evil laugh of his! <br>  One quote was always stuck with me, "Higher, higher burning fire, making music like a choir!"<br>  Hard to pick one, but if I had to I would go with Legend|`|28faeb718c3bfbe0b10b707965bb142baa	definitely NES, Legend is one of those films that everyone has a nostalgic feelings towards, but when you go back and watch it ( i just did last week) it's pretty boring.|`|QGy0fBRJaa	Hmm, tough choice, I would say The Neverending Story.  I remember that movie had more impact on me as a child then Legend did.  However, Tim Currey made a great Devil! hehe|`|cgjbw1jKaa	the neverending story. theres more funky characters in it .|`|Ke9cILe6aa	Legend all the way!
d7ezpKqSaa	Now thats not very nice of you.. I am the one who let all the people here know about it a couple of hours a go..<br>  <br>  anyway I think it is super amazing.. imagin vegeta 'galik gun'ing goku in HD wide screen.. or father son kamehameha with the latest computer effect... OMG!|`|ptPazvB8aa	wow i already no the whole show though so i dont really plan to.....well......watch it|`|4ca70aff6fe9d669e51622d33f67f685aa	that's interesting|`|4535wWzIaa	ARE YOU FREAKIN SERIOUS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!!?!?  THAT LIKE THE BIGGEST NEWS FLASH EVER. MATBE I SHOULDN"T BE SO EXCITED BUT I AM DBZ WAS THE BEST SHOW IN HISTORY.  PLEASE LET THIS BE TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RMDXjSXRaa	AWESOME can't wait 2 c it  ^_^
Uu0ROfuPaa	I haven't heard that but if he is... I'm first in line!<br>  I love her she's hilarious!! Lol|`|ph5Rs5uAaa	Definitely No. She needs to get back with Danity Kane|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	hmm?!<br>  I haven't heard about <br>  this.. But she needs<br>  to go back to danity kane!<br>  =]|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Ugh  I hope not she was definitely not a favorite!!!! she just needs to repent of her ways and get back with DK|`|j7wESGaDaa	no, i'm glad she's not too. she rlly wasn't as good as any of the other girls at all. i think she was just in it for the fame...<br>  <br>  but anyway Dawn is coming out w/ a CD. and Aubrey recently said that she wanted to be back in Danity Kane, but Diddy's not letting her bak in (he's completely done w/ her).

Not a lot, but a fair amount.  One of the very few opening sequences I wouldn't regularly skip was that for Dennou Coil.

jTkzSyzbaa	i hope so :)<br>  i'm a Pisces sun, Cancer moon, Aquarius rising; dated a Leo, a Gemini and two Scorpios.<br>   - the Leo one went down the drain because he was TOO obsessive and possessive. he got jealous in everything i do, every one i met and talked too, its ridiculous. even though i appreciate that how much love he had for me but come on :-/ . <br>   - next was this Gemini guy and i gotta admit that he was adorable and communicative, which attracted my sociable Aqua rising and venus. but my Pisces side yearned for a serious relationship afterall, so it couldnt cope with his playful and flirtatious personality. and i let go.  <br>   - the first Scorpio i dated was blunt and ended shortly lol because i pushed him to bed too fast :p .. he stopped contacting me after that even though i ran into him some times later but i played cool like i never dated him ever, treated him like stranger. i'm kinda thankful for my detached Aquarius traits.<br>  - right now i'm on a long distant relationship with another Scorpio(Cancer moon, Scorpio rising) and i have been doing some astrology research (dont want to make the same mistakes as the first one) to make sure how to make the best out of the relationship with them, and have more faith in them since they are too secretive to tell me everything on their mind. but one thing i know for sure that he's looking at the same direction as me. i wont be seeing him in person for another year or so, it should give us enough time to build trust and communication. <br>  talking about chemistry attraction wow Scorpios sure give me that amazing feeling when i'm around and kiss them :). i played kissing alot back then and got no particular feeling until i kissed a Scorpio. that's why i have high opinions on dating Scorpio.<br>  <br>   <br>  but anyway, congrats on your soulmate :). i hope i can be with mine soon too.|`|plBXp91Daa	My first boyfriend was a Taurus but do some reason we broke up.<br>  <br>  Now i'm married with an Aries guy and we have a good chemistry.|`|xEWVqdwnaa	Im a scorpio<br>  ive dated 3 libras 2capricorns and one taurus<br>  <br>  One libra i really liked him and he was soft nice and shy, but he couldnt just tell me things straight up. He cheated on me, as much as i loved him, i hate him now. I cant believe he cheated.<br>       Me and a capricorn guy got along great and we had so much fun together. I got bored with him after awhile, it was like a plain dull relationship.<br>       I love This taurus guy(: . He was amazing, i saw so much compassion in him. He was interesting, but we stopped talking and it went down the drain.<br>  <br>  I just met another scorpio, and he is extremely wonderful. We aren't dating, but im working on getting somewhere. When we look into each others eyes its like we can talk without words(: . And I feel we have a deep connection. He respects my privacy unlike some of my other friends too. And he is funny like me i admire his sense of humor. I think scorpio is meant to be my match.|`|xUxUwloPaa	My first girlfriend was a Leo (we were 13) and we dated for 6 months, which is pretty long when you're 13.<br>  <br>  My next girlfriend was a Gemini (we were 14) and the filthy skank cheated on me, and i really hope she gets hit by a bus after getting beaten profusely.<br>  <br>  I had a bunch of girls (4 or 5) that i went out with for a week or so that aren't really worth mentioning.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend/friend/who the hell knows? is a Taurus. We have great chemistry but she works and goes to school so she really doesn't have enough time for a boyfriend. I'm winning her heart though.
UnsZKr4saa	They're my favorite Thrash Metal band.  I like the fact that they take a more melodic approach on Thrash.  I already got their latest album (Hordes of Chaos) as well, sounds very good.<br>  <br>  BQ: Violent Revolution<br>  BQ2: Enemy of God|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i actually just recently got into them. i got that new album you speak of (hordes of chaos) because it got a lot of good reviews, so i went out and got it. great album! so i am now a kreator fan. unfortunately its the only music by them ive heard as of right now but i am going to change that as soon as possible.<br>  i think its time for me to get ENEMY OF GOD.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Yep. Fkin Badd@$$. I was lucky enough to come across them back in 1986, I haven't heard a song from them I don't like.<br>  <br>  <br>  Song: Don't Trust<br>  Album: Pleasure To Kill|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Awesome thrash metal band.<br>  BQ: Enemy Of God<br>  BQ2: Enemy Of God or Hordes Of Chaos|`|1eQcq4eZaa	hey, all other factors aside, they are true metal, which is saying alot these days<br>  <br>  they get plenty of points for that alone|`|AbyiijyTaa	Kreator is an amazing band.  They're one of the greats of Thrash Metal.  I like them more than other popular bands, like Anthrax.  <br>  <br>  Song:  Tormentor<br>  Album:  Both Endless Pain, and Pleasure to Kill|`|O02cXOTTaa	Hordes of Chaos is pretty good, but certainly not their best work.<br>  <br>   theyre pretty awesome though i got into them alonggg time ago, havnt been disappointed with them since:)<br>  <br>  BQ: Under the Guillotine<br>  BQ2: Pleasure to Kill|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I like them the Tommy V. days are my favorite I am a huge fan of Tommy especially his work in Coroner.

E2VUH8Q0aa	I'm more silly in person. I'm only serious on here, because people are so stupid and it frustrates my Mercury in Capricorn.<br>  <br>  But IRL, I'm pretty silly. I use disco balls, hand puppets, baby toys, and air horns as training aids...and I teach adults. <br>  <br>  I have different signature hand movements that make people laugh. I make balloon animals, do string and ball magic, and even went to clown school. I own (and frequently use) a giant pair of sunglasses, a giant comb, flyswatter, and a squirting camera. <br>  <br>  Sometimes I snort when I laugh, but it's usually on purpose. And I'm not ashamed of it, either.<br>  <br>  People learn better when they're laughing and engaged so it's all part of a day's work for me.  <br>  <br>  Sun in Capricorn<br>  Moon in Aqua<br>  Mars and Rising in Pisces<br>  <br>  .....BUT I have Midheaven in Sag...so there's the key.<br>  <br>  **guess the stupid people got offended. At least they know who they are...shrug**|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Definitely silly. I don't get along with people that are serious and uptight 24/7. I LOVE being around people that have a great sense of humor and like acting goofy. I actually consider laughing a hobby because I love to do it so much lol. Also, I don't think that there's really a distinction between being mature and being silly. You can definitely be both. Being childlike is admirable and nothing like being childish. I know how to be serious when the times calls for it but when I'm out with friends we enjoy acting like a bunch of Kramers. It doesn't take much to make me laugh either and I love that. If I could befriend every silly person in the world I would because to me you can never be sad around that kind of person :)|`|XEG2ZTJjaa	Well I'm usually a very serious person but I and a big kid and can lighten up at the drop of a hat. I enjoy making people laugh and just having fun but I am serious when I need to be, I have the right mixture of maturity and immaturity  I guess lol<br>  <br>  Virgo Sun<br>  Leo moon<br>  Virgo Mars<br>  Aries Rising|`|xUxUwloPaa	I know everyone is going to say both, but I'm a Libra so i REALLY am both. Sometimes i'm so goofy my friends get freaked out, and other times i am so serious people say i need to lighten up. Go figure.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	It really depends on the situation.All these questions of yours seem to be thinking about how we act always,when in reality everyone reacts differently to different situations.|`|oDdXpghDaa	I'm Pisces... so I'm both - serious sometimes, silly others...  the two fish for sure...|`|AA10197672	I'm more Serious than silly. However, once opened up to the person I can make them laugh till they drop...|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Yes, like the first guy: Pisces as well but balanced with both serious and silliness.|`|vGbTKA2Haa	hmm I would say Im more silly than serious I laugh alot especially when I'm nervous. but I can be serious when the situation calls for it<br>  <br>  Im very chill and laid back and as much as I love cheerful people.... bubbly, hyper people annoy me a bit when I'm around them too much...don't get me wrong I can act very goofy and loud too but Im talking about those people who are just FULL of energy and just LOVE attention, cuz I don't like to attract attention to myself it makes me a tad uncomfortable,, <br>  <br>  it doesn't mean I prefer pessimists either lol its just my closest friends tend to be more like myself|`|c0351b6a4e515538a18ee7d22027f59eaa	Just like most Sagittarius people, seldom feels down, most of the time with a sunny attitude, sometimes a bit childlike, and likes simple fun. Often tells the truth when they shouldn't.|`|inMfHLWoaa	I'm a pices and i am totally menta. I always do random things that may humiliate me just for a laugh. some people think i'm weird but they just care too much about what others think...my friends think im a laugh so who cares right?!|`|pLUItVZ1aa	im a libra but im deffinatley more silly|`|mD7eAAoNaa	I think I am a little bit of both. I am serious when it comes to school work and getting things done on time. I am mature when it comes to arguments, family problems, problems in general, unfortunate situations. I can be silly when with my friends, impersonating Stewie from Family Guy, Cartman from South Park, talking in different accents, making fart jokes, stuff like that. <br>  <br>  Virgo Sun<br>  Cancer Moon<br>  Scorpio Rising<br>  <br>  I really like your astrology discussion questions! =D|`|LDLTjNCraa	I'm more silly, and I definitely have a child like quality. Today someone called me a 'little girl' because I was jumping down the steps we were walking down x)|`|uel6NBOVaa	I'm both. I guess that's the whole Libra balancing act coming to play. As I've said in all of your other questions, it depends on the situation, the people I'm around, and most importantly the mood I'm in. If I'm really tired, especially over tired, I tend to get a bit silly and crazy. If I'm at home or around good friends the childlike side of me tends to show. I don't often show that side of me in public, and in work or school situations I'm always the more quiet and serious one. Other people's personalities often project onto me, so it really does depend on the people and atmosphere I'm in at the time. I don't like to be confined to one personality type. I think I'm so many things, I could never accurately describe myself. <br>  <br>  Libra Sun, Rising, and Mars<br>  Cancer Moon|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am too much scorpio I guess, I can be both but in general I am mature and serious.  I am very hard on myself and am always working on doing everything right or trying to be the best person I can be. <br>  <br>  However, I have a very fun, playful, silly side when I lighted up and I can make people laugh alot. <br>  <br>  The serious side is still the dominate I guess.|`|lOkWLI9Caa	I am definately serious most of the time and it's not because of my age(28). I always have been.  I am also mature and even as a teenager I was serious and mature. <br>  <br>  I can be silly when I am really happy and not worried about anything, which is not that often unfortunately. I do have a dry sense of humor and I can be sarcastic alot of times.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I'm both, Hon.<br>  <br>  I like to be goofy and stuff, but when things are boring and I'm just listening to my iPod, I'm very serious.<br>  <br>  ...unless there is a song that makes me sing or dance! :D<br>  <br>  So I say a bit of both, kinda leaning towards the serious part.<br>  <br>  But when I'm alone I think I'm at my silliest.<br>  <br>  Taurus sun, Virgo moon, Mars in Gemini and Leo rising. <br>  <br>  :)

I can also roll my tonge and whistle through it and I can also twist it... but only clockwise. I wonder why.<br>  <br>  edit: I think it's because I have a big nose and my tongue seems average to me, but maybe I actually have a freakishly long tongue. Hm. Most of the women on my Mom's side can roll their tongues, and I learned to whistle through it as a kid... and my twin sister can't do it!! It sounds kind of like a quiet flute or recorder.

More people can roll their tongue than not, but less people can touch their nose with their tongue than not. The latter requires a long and pointy tongue.. and most people who can roll their tongue can't touch their nose, because their tongue needs to be quite wide to roll it.|`|AaAwnFNJaa	ouch no<br>  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|obvLU0HSaa	no! <br>  <br>  thanks!<br>  i just noticed every one in the room staring at me for trying!|`|Y8byax2paa	No , but can touch a g-spot with it!|`|QC9DNd4Qaa	Personaly mine cant but I do know 2 guys (unrelated) that can stick their tongue inside their nostril.

vDPn7CaUaa	I pronounce it like I'm sayin "Fishin Chips"|`|v8Jw4wRPaa	I've heard that claim before, and it seems to be true. Just as the difference in six as 'sucks' (Kiwi) and 'seeks' (Aussie.)<br>  <br>  Being British, I say 'fish and chips' using the flat 'i' vowel that you might use at the beginning of 'inconsequential' or the first 'i' in 'Philadelphia.' You can look up the exact pronunciation using a phonetic alphabet. If you can't use a phonetic alphabet, there are guides.<br>  <br>  If you go to the website below, it will teach you a basic usage of the phonetic alphabet and on looking up 'fish' or 'chips' will show phonetically how it is pronounced by British people. The same will apply if you look in an Australian, Scottish, etc etc dictionary.|`|dNL4n2oGaa	I say it Fish n' Chips but when my parents are around I say Fish and Chips because they are Chinese(And so am I but they have an accent)|`|av36HJ5Vaa	fish n chips.<br>  <br>  learned it the brittish way, thats just how it is to me now.|`|ybxVDqMwaa	Fish and Fries.<br>  <br>  United States :)|`|3cGgRo42aa	fips;]<br>  fish-chips combined|`|uNV9I68zaa	Who the hell orders fish and chips?|`|4dZu7yxAaa	"fush and chups" - lol that's pretty cool<br>  <br>  I would say fish and chips|`|Ova4dilbaa	I say it<br>  "Fish and chips."<br>  Strange question.<br>  Hahahaa <3|`|AA11609300	I just say fish 'n chips....<br>  <br>  (Pete's is the best!!)|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Fish nd Chips|`|LF7qeNskaa	Fishn Chips :D|`|mxD3vkUQaa	Fish 'nd Chips : )<br>  <br>  X|`|378838a44c6cfeeb4333c3cb60112801aa	fish n chips|`|6gdEKcehaa	fish n chips....dc|`|WkO39sZjaa	fish and chips with a silent h  (fish and cips) i'm from stoke-on-trent england|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Fish n chipps|`|PpWosZsIaa	Fish and Chips|`|GwwcqUCoaa	Not polite to talk with a mouthful of food.

c0351b6a4e515538a18ee7d22027f59eaa	They are either looking at your perfection, or looking for things about you that could be more perfect. Because they are perfectionists. If you find a person who is always neat and tidy in their appearance and the way they conduct their lives is always planned and organised, and belongings are always kept tidy, they will probably be a Virgo.|`|9wSjCIsTaa	how can you tell what their sign is....<br>  oh man i would hate for them to look 30 seconds extra then haha.|`|3WItFAwlaa	They are staring through you not at you.  Their minds are somewhere else entirely.|`|IRQvzk5saa	From two virgo girls that i knew, i kinda got the impression that they stare too.  im only basing this off of the two girls, but i would think its their way of looking for something or trying to give off an impression.  More like an analytical psych thing that the two girls i knew tried to do.  almost like they were trying to calculate my reactions/actions or give off that impression.  Maybe thats what they are doing.  Virgos I assume, are really mental and smart.  the staring thing may be unintentional, but they might be just "analyzing".both girls i knew were testy but smart.  im guessing based on my experience with the two virgo girls that i knew, but wouldnt have a hard time believing virgos did this for analytical mind game reasons? either that or they just have a flat out problem with staring at people.lol|`|XEG2ZTJjaa	Well I think I do actually. I'm usually zoned out so I just look anywhere and sometimes people think I'm staring at them but then I catch myself and look in another direction. SO I'm staring but not really paying attention to what I'm staring at if that makes sense.|`|NV9FoM5Jaa	ewww.... I never realized that until you just pointed it out. To tell you the truth I think they are looking for all your imperfections,because pretty much everyone disgust them,and they think they are better then you in every way shape and form.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I never noticed that|`|evABGdqwaa	really? wow, im a virgo, and im shy. staring at couples is weird, and i wouldnt look at a couple for like more then 10 seconds haha<br>  not that couples are weird or anything, i just dont like staring at people lol|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	They think you're cute and stare because they can't believe you're with that loser.

MoUtk7cUaa	no.  the volume that the file takes up is dependent on the data rate you select during rip, 64, 128, 192, etc<br>  <br>  ps.  pc mag did a test of editors and contibutors to their mag.  they had them bring in their favorite music, had them listen to the cd, a high quality rip (windows lossless 480 i think), a mid quality rip 320 or so, and a lower rip 128 or so.  only 1 of them could make the differentialtion.  so if you're using ordinary headphones on an mp3 player, you can easily get away w/ a low rate on the rip, say 128.  i use 192 for everything i own and lossless for 'borrowed' tunes, incase i wish to make another cd.|`|saJoelMwaa	Nope, same thing.|`|4mRAESAVaa	nope i think its all the same??|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	depends on the size of the mp3 file<br>  it doesn't matter where it is from, if the file size is small then it is small if it's big then it's big|`|gl4MePuDaa	ya if you don't compress them first from cda format<br>  <br>  most ppl choose mp3<br>  <br>  but flac or monkey audio etc are lossless at least|`|Ofh5zBanaa	no man its all the same. unless theres extra stuff on the songs or somethin|`|DC64wxBeaa	It depends how you rip the CD's, quality ranges from 320Kbps to 64Kbps (as far as I know) obviously the higher the quality the more space it would take.  As a music producer myself I can tell you that if you want high quality rip them at 320Kbps (my standards, don't like anything under lol) but 256Kpbs isn't too bad.  <br>  <br>  But if you don't mind too much about quality then I suggest 128Kbps there's no point in anything higher than that up to 256 because the difference is hard to tell. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to mention these are some info for mp3's (same when converted to iTune format) on how much space roughly they can take up for a 3 and a half min song:<br>  <br>  320Kbps = 8.5mb<br>  256Kbps = 6.5mb<br>  224Kbps = 6mb<br>  192Kbps = 5mb<br>  160Kbps = 4mb<br>  128Kbps = 3.5mb<br>  <br>  Just incase you didn't know 1000mb is 1GB<br>  <br>  You might rip them as WAV files which means they an be up to around 2000Kbps+.  But they can take up to 32mb or more, so its not really worth it, even though they are lossless audio files.  Lossless means that the audio sounds exactly like the original on the CD with no loss of quality or sounds. <br>  <br>  On mp3's theres's a little bit of a difference on the higher frequancies like the vocals, some other instruments and stuff.  But you have to have amazing ears to be a able to tell, and like I said before it'll stay the same when you convert them to iTune format :)|`|438f473be46cc5289e5c24b78adac392aa	probably not because they are compacted into a cd r and if you were to use lime wire that would produce more megs.

yqe0I5zpaa	He's an incredible actor. He gave great performances in The Air I Breath, Milk, Alpha Dog and Into The Wild, also he was funny in The Girl Next Door, but he picks films that aren't very commercial, but are well-made films. He is very liked by critics and hopefully one day, he'll get a well-deserved Oscar.|`|y8WBcehmaa	he's not underrated by me!<br>  <br>  I love that guy, he was amazing in milk<br>  <br>  I also secretly love speed racer|`|QGy0fBRJaa	My guess is that he hasn't made enough big movies yet.  I liked him in Lords of Dogtown, Speedracer and Milk but he hasn't had a breakthrough role yet or movies where he is the lead.  Maybe he will get offered more lead roles with his performance in Milk.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Yeah, I've actually thought the same thing, it's rare to find a young actor who is willing to take a few bold choices to get respect as an actor rather than just a face.

However, Librans are born leaders, but unfortunately can never make up their minds before someone else decides that a decision has to be made. He will make the money, you will find guide yourself guiding him on what he 'could' spend the money on, but he will still make that final decision, probably without you being in on the final choice.<br>  A relationship you will have to work on after admitting your strengths and weaknesses. Even though you believe in Astrology, he probably will not.|`|a85f51bc1ebf5d87f5dd0aee9e9e7afbaa	mh! I'm a Taurus Girl, and I'm always thinking on ways to obtain money, but not for the materialistic side... <br>  I feel the necessity to support my partner in that way.<br>  My goal is to have a happy family, romantic loving spouse, peaceful and comfortable life(not necessary luxurious), and give the best that I can to them.<br>  and yeah! I've been in a relationship with a libra, lovely indecisive. =D<br>  <br>  and no, you don't have to worry about having a good job, that's why we worry about it...<br>  <br>  the only thing I've heard that will make a taurus mad is seen u expending money like crazy in stoopid things.<br>  ...and I have to agree =D|`|DLYBNA1paa	Yah honey I'm a Taurus and all i can say is that the money are pretty much like an addiction to us. But you must see ur boyfriend's Asc. That's got a very big influence of him. I've met at least 5 Taurus boys. 2 of them were obsessed with money, 1 was an extremly big egoist , 1 was inlove with himself and the last one was a hater boy ;P So.. as you can see we can't say a thing without having more information ;)
NqlWkqm9aa	Dude I have been trying to do this for ages. His voice is pretty unique. However if you hear him sing with no music his voice sounds pretty bad and a little whiny. But I have noticed his voice has gotten better since say the early blink days. I think you're just gonna have to practice, but singing is just one of those things you either can or can't do. Its very hard to mimic another person if it doesn't already come naturally. Well good luck dude.

yqe0I5zpaa	Milk is incredible, great performances all around by Penn, Hirsch, Brolin and Franco but Slumdog Millionaire is just an amazing film, its a truly unique film, one in a million, you have to see it.|`|D2WLPK0gaa	Ive only seen Slumdog Millionare and I think its GENIUS!<br>  I haven't seen any movie like it.. its kinda complicated & weird but in the same time really amazing. Then it gets sad...
4Kzd0gSlaa	The bottom two will probably be Allison and Matt, although if there was going to be a shocker, it's going to be Kris and Matt on the bottom two. I think Matt is going home, but if we have a shocker it could be Allison.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	I did not vote but if I would have I would have voted for Danny and Chris... They are my Favorites! I think Danny is just wonderful! There is nothing that he cant sing and make it sound wonderful...<br>  <br>  I think in the bottom 2 will be Matt and the girl, I cant think of her name right now...<br>  <br>  I think the girl will go home... And although I dont like him at all... I think Adam will win...|`|wFMhmZCYaa	I voted for Danny about 100 times, plus made my friend vote for him too.<br>  <br>  I think bottom two will be Matt and Allison. I think Matt will be<br>  going home.|`|dwOkMC1qaa	well i cant vote, but if i cud i wud of voted for adam & allison, my favourites at this point..|`|X5f9M0kcaa	i didnt vote but i hope allison stays for at least another week shes really good and no offense but i hope adam or matt go home cause they both suck|`|JGjpc7Itaa	I voted ten times for Danny on my land line with not problems.  I used his second number.<br>  <br>  I think Matt and Allison will be in the bottom two even though I loved both of their performances.  I thought that Kris and Adam (for the first time) had the weakest performances.  i think Matt will go home though I wish it would be Kris.|`|OxxrqzCzaa	I voted for Allison for like an hour straight back-to-back, but I didn't keep track of how many times.  Bottom 2 I HOPE is Matt & Kris...I want them BOTH to go home, so Either One is FINE with me!  I want the finale to be Danny & Allison...Allison FTW!

AA12273031	hasn't shonen jump always cost 4.99? i just looked at all my copies and saw that they always cost 4.99...but if you get a subscription it's would only cost 29.95 for the whole year which means each book cost around 2.50...idk it's always been like that...but shojo beat (for girls) cost 5.99 and yen+ (also for girls) cost 9.99...so i'm quite happy that shonen jump cost 4.99...

Gznvci2baa	No I don't have one and I think that would hurt to have done more than normal ear piercings, and I dont think it looks particularly nice?|`|JhJXKRkOaa	No, I don't.<br>  <br>   I have my ears pierced, but I have one behind the other on the ear lobe, that's pretty. <br>  <br>  Don't get it done, I've herd it hurts alot.|`|wZloBlGlaa	they're  okay|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Every time I had it pierced there, it always got really infected and never healed. But that's just how my body is I think. All my piercings have always taken a long time to heal, it sucks. <br>  <br>  I think it's a fad that is slowly dying out though. That's my thoughts on it. Used to be cool, but I don't know that it is anymore.|`|4YnoykD2aa	I'm 38, and got one on my birthday. I love it. It's a tasteful pink hoop. Overall, I like them on everyone, but too many in general can get skanky looking.|`|0utZQuyeaa	I have one, & I like it. Doesn't look trashy. I have a friend that has 2 piercings like that, & she's the same age as you.<br>  -shrugs-<br>  Get one! :)|`|CArzkDIUaa	depends on who you're piercing|`|128833184801fb3ff90fe4b271c5a6efaa	I like them and have three.  Two are at the top, and one is half way up the ear.<br>  <br>  The one thing I would tell about these piercings is that they take much longer to heal than a lobe piercing.  Some can take up to a year to heal, so don't be in a hurry to change the earring.  Mine tend to get infected more easily than my lobe piercings (of which there are seven), but that could just be my ears.<br>  <br>  If you can, go to a piercer and not the jewelry store or kiosk in your mall.  Getting it done with a gun isn't as good for the ear as getting it done with a needle.  Just remember, either way you get it done, you'll need a parent to okay it.|`|AA10829079	i have one - i got mine when i was about 13 or 14 i think -<br>  <br>      they look good and they're not super crazy like a lip piercing or anything else you wouldn't want for your first big piercing<br>  <br>     my suggestion is get it done with a needle and not a gun - a gun fractures the cartilage - so even though i've had this pierced for like 3 years it still hurts sometimes.|`|1HnJXVSHaa	lol i was thinking of getting one too....but i heard they take a long time to heal. i already have four ear piercings though, and it might be a hassle if i got anymore. i kinda like them, though.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	I have one. but the ring I have in it is a little different than just  a stud.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://secure.techxpress.net/leroi.com/images/uploads/ti_tw.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://secure.techxpress.net/leroi.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Like that, but silver.|`|a2b5549c80fdb444d8075ce8c9c9d17baa	theyre pretty. nope.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	they don't look trashy their nice but make sure you go to a Professional piercer not one in your local mall|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	I like them :)<br>  & no but i'm getting one soon :)|`|It2akeQIaa	I think they look extreamly trashy|`|hxNBgXXaaa	I have one.

v6IOiPumaa	The World Cosplay Summit is where 2 Representatives from different Countries are sent to Japan to compete in their Cosplay against others.<br>  <br>  It's basicly a Cosplay Competition; but against people from other countries. And in Japan.<br>  <br>  -Incase you don't know; Cosplay is 'Costume Play' or dressing up as a specific character -I don't mean a random ghost for Halloween.<br>  <br>  As for participating; if you have nearby conventions/anime conventions; rumage through the home page and cosplay section.<br>  One of them hopefully should somehow mention the World Cosplay Summit.<br>  <br>  What happens is you show off your cosplay that YOU made. (That's right; YOU have to had made it yourself) the judges will judge you on how close you are to acting like your character; how close your outfit is to your character's own and how you made it.<br>  If you won the preliminary round; Congratulations!<br>  Now the judges of your country/area will judge your Cosplay to the other winners and judge it.<br>  <br>  If you won that; congrats! You're representing your country!<br>  Afterwards I think all expenses are paid and you're sent to Japan!<br>  <br>  As for prizes.. I have no idea what you get.

azIA2rmRaa	Actually, I saw Black Tide and Escape The Fate live on Feb. 20th with Zacky V's Sister! We met them and everything, it was great. But they are so talented, they put on a phenomenal show. They are very into what they are doing, and I really admire that about them. And they aren't just stupid kids who don't know anything. It's so cool because before they go on, and after too they just walk around the crowd and people talk to them. That's how I met Steven and Gabriel. The only thing is Black Tide keeps getting ripped off with a bad sound system. The sound guy is like retarded. Compaired to Escape The Fate, who sounds clear as day, Black Tide sounds much heavier and it's harder to understand them. But there's no doubt they put on a wonderful show.<br>  And by the way, Avenged Sevenfold sucks live? Are YOU kidding? Avenged Sevenfold was the best band I've ever seen play a live show. They are so talented it melts my face. They sound so great. Yeah, the older stuff doesn't sound quite the same but the new stuff sounds just like the record. I saw them twice and was blown away both times. And I'm seeing them again 3/19/09. =) A7X!|`|0hXKHyDzaa	yes they are amazing.<br>  i saw them on the 18th.<br>  i think black tide did better on stage than escape the fate but<br>  i love escape the fate. they were great too.|`|qLqYSeqRaa	ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! BLACK TIDE IS INCREDIBLE LIVE!! I saw them less then a week ago, Friday the 20th. It was the best night of my life, I met the guys from Black Tide! Anyway, they put on an amazing show, too, their set list was great, though the sound system could have been better. But, it was a tiny little show, in a small church (yes, a church, haha) so they're obviously not going to sound as clear as if they were playing a big show like Ozzfest. Escape The Fate sounded pretty good, though I'm not a big fan so my opinion's automatically biased a bit. But the tickets were cheap, and it was totally worth it! AHH that night was amazing. So yes, GO! You will not be sorry! Give Black Tide big kissies for me!

wA8Dyhq7aa	None.  In the overwhelming majority of cases (99.99999999% of the time), a record label will either return your unsolicited demo unopened or throw it in the garbage without opening it.  They get them daily, and they toss them daily.<br>  <br>  If you want to start doing more, then expand your gig playing beyond your community.  Try to get an opening spot for a regional act.  Lots of artists have been discovered as being local opening acts.<br>  <br>  And, whatever you do, make sure you're ready to have doors slammed in your face and to be told "no" millions of times before you ever hear a "yes" or even a "maybe."|`|ZqidUxbYaa	try myspace

gp7qmHsMaa	People people people. You have it all wrong. Joanna did not get disqualified due to having a previous recording contact (American Idol rules state that a contestant cannot have a current record deal but can have had one in the past). She got disqualified for having personal connections with two execs from 19 Entertainment, the company that produces American Idol, which is a violation against American Idol rules.|`|wA7kqXfRaa	contestant with a lengthy entertainment resume has been disqualified after reaching the show's top 36.<br>  <br>  In its press released issued Wednesday night announcing the semifinalists, Fox TV said that Joanna Pacitti was "ineligible to continue." No reason was given by Fox.<br>  <br>  But a person familiar with the decision said Thursday that Pacitti was dropped to avoid any appearance of business impropriety. The person, who did not elaborate, spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized by Fox and the show's producers to talk about the dismissal.<br>  <br>  The decision was made because Pacitti had once worked with a person subsequently hired by 19 Entertainment, which produces "American Idol" with FremantleMedia, said another person familiar with the disqualification. Pacitti also knew a second 19 Entertainment employee, the person said.<br>  <br>  Pacitti was dropped from the show to avoid any suggestion of unfairness, said the person, who asked that his or her name not be used because the person was not authorized to talk about the dismissal.<br>  <br>  Felicia Barton of Virginia Beach, Va., replaced Pacitti, a Philadelphia native, in the top 36.|`|AA10962298	She has already had a professional career. They want to keep Idol as an amateur competition to help discover NEW talent.  She also had been acquainted with people who worked for the Idol production company.|`|cQoNzj5Gaa	cause she probably sucked|`|UA6mt9ESaa	idk|`|jRJKDceqaa	ok|`|3V1qNw6Eaa	Pacitti auditioned for the eighth season of American Idol in Louisville, Kentucky, in an episode that aired on January 21, 2009. She passed the audition into the Hollywood round. Pacitti's future accomplishments have stirred debate about whether American Idol contestants should be strictly amateur performers.<br>  <br>  On the February 11 Idol broadcast, she was shown advancing into the Top 36. FOX issued a press release the next morning announcing that Pacitti was "ineligible to continue" and was removed from the competition.[4] According to Star magazine, the reasoning behind this was that Pacitti has "very personal connections" to Michelle Young and Roger Widynowski, two executives that work for American Idol's 19 Entertainment Los Angeles office. In addition to living in the same apartment complex as the 19 Entertainment executives for several years, Pacitti has also allegedly called Young her "manager" and "best friend" and credited Widynowski -- a former RCA Records publicist -- with "helping me get where I am today."[citation needed] She was replaced on the program by Felicia Barton.|`|a766661bb7dbb13127569416a3fd110eaa	She had already had a previous music contract. They got into a lot of trouble for allowing all the ones with previous contracts last season so they decided to stop it and not let anyone with a previous music contract come on the show.|`|t5VkiR05aa	She had a previiously recorded album. Even though the record was not widely known, it is against the American Idol rules to have previously records. She was replaced by another top 24 girl.|`|R5tF14Bbaa	she was in a relationship with someone that works for 'American Idol'|`|jPc81D5iaa	apparently she had a relationship with someone who works for american idol|`|lqqWmCDGaa	because she had a record deal before|`|cVoJA7Xvaa	she knew too much

Except I can't figure out how he swam away from the hole in the ice after freeing Roxy, but then came up somewhere else.  Why show him walk away alive if they were positive he'd be gone for good.  If they replace him with a different actor though, I'd be dissapointed.  I finally started to like him after amy was born and he softened up.|`|7Es1LjvHaa	Funilly enough, YES!<br>  <br>  I  saw a piccie of him I think from the 'Soaplife' magazine. I'm confused as I thought although he wasn't completely killed off, he was supposingly quitting Enders to pursue other projects, would be nice to see him though. Incidentally, this soap once again is falling down the gutter. UP THE CORRIE!! (And Tina McIntyre ;-))|`|9kTejB0uaa	I hope not - he was a one-dimensional actor, like Charlie, with just one expression.   But if things get lean out in the real world (which given his limited abilities it may well do), I guess he might be back.|`|kXCgQoYLaa	The next time we see him will probably be on ' The Bill'  or 'Strictly Come Dancing'-  he'd look hot in uniform  or Latin- American gear...

1CqTmAVXaa	Frankie does have some unique characteristics. She is the ONLY human character(and that even includes Imaginary Friends that look like humans, such as Princey)who does not have round pupils; hers are verticle elipses, like Wilt's. And then, there's that unnaturally red hair, which she's had since she was a baby(note the difference in the shade of red or Frankie's hair, and hair WE normally consider "red", like Louise's, or that nasty little brat who wanted to adopt Bloo and name him "Tiffany"). It does make me wonder if Frankie is not totally "natural" humam. Part of that has to do with the fact that we've NEVER, ever heard any mention of the presumably-deceased MR. Foster, Madame Foster's husband and Frankie's paternal grandfather, and that does seem a bit odd. I can't help but wonder if at some point we won't learn that he was, in fact, an Imaginary Friend himself. We know that Frankie had parents at one point, because she mentions them in "Who Let The Dogs In", AND, unlike all the other Imaginary Friends, Frankie DID have a childhood that began in infancy and progressed at a normal rate to where she is today, so unless she was specifically created by some kid to do that(which would be REALLY odd, given that most kids would either want an IF that remained a perpetual baby, or was more or less the same age, mentally and emotionally, as themselves), that goes against what we know so far about Imaginary Friends. Still, Frankie's memory of her parents could be a "false memory", created by someone telling her about them, or what they wanted her to believe about them. On the surface, she seems like an ordinary 22-23 year-old woman, but there's a definate sense of mystery about her past and her childhood, not to mention why she has eyes that are so different from all the other human characters.|`|eQoj3fYGaa	edwardo

He drove by a car and saw a couple inside with the dome light on. There was a young man in the driver's seat reading a computer magazine and a young lady in the back seat knitting. He stopped to investigate. He walked up to the driver's window and knocked. The young man looked up, cranked the window down, and said, "Yes Officer?"<br>  <br>  "What are you doing?" the policeman asked. "What does it look like?" answered the young man. "I'm reading this magazine." Pointing towards the young lady in the back seat, the officer then asked, "And what is she doing?" The young man looked over his shoulder and replied, "What does it look like? She's knitting."<br>  <br>  "And how old are you?" the officer then asked the young man. "I'm nineteen," he replied. "And how old is she?" asked the officer. The young man looked at his watch and said, "Well, in about twelve minutes she'll be sixteen."|`|odyPIPvRaa	It sounds a little racist but i got it from a favorite movie and i am not one bit racist...<br>  three guys are walkin on a beach- a mexican black guy and white guy<br>  they find a lamp and rub it so that a genie comes out<br>  the genie says he will grant each of them a wish.<br>  so the black guy goes first, he says i wish for me and all my black people to be back in africa. so the genie says poof and his wish is granted.<br>  the mexican goes next and wishes for him and all of his mexican people to be back in mexico. so the genie says poof and his wish is granted.<br>  the white man is all thats left and the genie says ok its ur turn. the white guy says so u mean to tell me all the spics and porch monkeys are gone? the genie says yea. so the white guy says well then i'll have a coke.
AA10314304	i agree, i'm native and ppl would call me pocahontas as if it was their only "knowledge" of native americans, which was historically inaccurate. The cultural stereotypes is bad but I don't think there's anything wrong with fairy tales. They give little kids hope and encourage their imagination. If you want to get rid of those you should go ahead and get rid of all childrens books too.|`|y8WBcehmaa	Anastasia and Prince of Egypt are NOT disney<br>  <br>  Anastasia is 20th Century Fox, and Prince of Egypt is dreamworks, get your facts straight.<br>  <br>  now to answer.<br>  I don't think The Lion King gives negative feelings towards africa, because it only discusses the animals that live there. And they tried to be accurate with them..<br>  <br>  I don't see how 101 Dalmations is ignorant about London, most of it takes place in the countryside. I don't recall any stereotypes in it.<br>  <br>  As for Aladdin, Pocahontas, and Mulan. I don't think they make children ignorant if they understand that they are movies. They are good animated films, though I will concede they can be a bit stereotypical of those cultures.|`|qRErPLqoaa	You forgot Cinderella.... I did a unit in college about Cinderella.

Ow3O7h4caa	Your Venus shows a need for security, and a home-loving, person who likes to cuddle is what your heart desires. You make one feel safe from harm or emotional hurts and expect this in return as well. You seem to want to know and understand the feelings or fears of the one you would flirt with. You can offer emotional support or a shoulder to cry on, and you expect someone who could make one feel "at home.<br>  <br>  Mars in Taurus, on the other hand, puts you in contact with down-to-earth type of males, sensual , yet stable. A man who can cook, cuddle, and care for your comfort interests you and you want a man who isn't afraid to touch and caress you. You're very strong-willed yourself - yet deep down you wouldn't mind being dominated by a strong passionate male. But you won't admit it. <br>  <br>  With Sun ruler in 4th, parents may present obstacles to marriage or, it will be a marriage planned by the parents. They want yo protet their reputation more or less. Gemini in 4th gives frequent changes of residence with the possibility of more than one home later in life. With Sun in 4th, it makes you easily gullible with some inferiority complex, moodiness with many highs and lows. <br>  your parents may be generous and sometimes provide a home for you. This brings up the question of real estate which would be good for you.<br>  The square from Saturn may give you a tendency to procrastinate and personal desires often cause conflict.<br>  <br>  As for your 5th in Gemini and with Venus / Cancer, you may have multiple love affairs, and still provide strong emotional ties to these lovers. You are highly romantic with a strong flair for the dramatic due to Mercury in 5th house ; you love more on a mental level. Venus in Cancer often brinfgs delays in marriage on account of money or occupation; a parent may help or hinder the marriage. With mars in Taurus, I would suspect early love affairs and scandal through attachments. <br>  <br>  The opposition Uranus and Neptune......you can expect abrupt separations regarding love affairs and attachments. Neptune will present you with the ideal partner but you will not be able to hold on to it. Many deceptions, cheating, and clandestine unions. You need to be more realistic and come down from cloud nine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

irSBrZiQaa	Phillip did not fake his death, Alan was behind the whole thing. Basically Phillip started to lose his mind, so Alan felt it was time to take action to protect his company and his grandchildren. Alan did shoot Phillip, but Phillip survived. Alan hid Phillip in a warehouse, where Phillip thought that he was CEO. The warehouse was set up to look like Spaulding, but indeed it was not. Harley was blamed for the shooting, but it came out that Alan was the one who shot him. Alan tried to tell everyone that Phillip was alive, but no one believed him. The people who were taking care of Phillip quit because Alan could no longer pay them as he was in an institution for shooting Phillip. Then Phillip went Missing, until he contacted Rick. Phillip said that he decided to stay away until he got his health back. <br>  <br>  I love that Phillip is back and I hope that he is sane :)

Poor Annie she may be crazy, but certainly far more likable than Ryan..and now this recent revenge on Zack I mean come on that is quite a stretch in logic, even for Ryan..even for a soap opera. I mean how many people is Ryan gonna tell that Zach and Reese slept together when all he saw was a kiss..just like the many kisses exchanged between Him and Greenlee while she was married to Aiden...It just frustrates me to know end that he still has so many friends and supporters on that show..everyone should hate him by now....PS I love Aiden and Annie..they are cute :)|`|Qc3svDzNaa	I use to really like his character and him, but ever since DWTS, I do NOT.  He is over acting and over exposed.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Me! Me! <br>  <br>  He goes a while and he's okay but then he goes crazy. He needs to get a room next to Annie.|`|Zss0O9tjaa	I second that motion.

AA11898755	Yeah...I'm ambivalent about it too. Sad and wierd at once. But....can you blame someone for trying to leave behind a few pennies or wanting not to think they just disappear after they're dead? When Tony Snow (Bush press secy) was terminal he left the admin to do book and lectures to provide for his family after the inevitable. If this somehow gives her a sense of control and of having left a mark, or if it allows her some small estate then its ok by me.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Think her plight has done some good - young women getting smears etc...

I dont mind people earning money... but her kids can't BUY her remaining time back<br>  <br>  I do feel for her... but having lost someone to cancer theres no way I would have wasted one of their last seconds on money making|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	I feel so, so sorry for her.<br>  Even though she was racist, no-one desearves cancer.<br>  The only reason she is doing lots of interviews is because she is raising money for her little boys to have when they are 18.<br>  They wont have a mum :(|`|ZcrqGl5Naa	WHO IS THAT

cy7freI8aa	I certainly wouldn't call it jazz. A lot of folks have a tendency to call any instrumental music with a sax jazz, but I'd call this disco or instrumental pop.<br>  <br>  As far as the name, there's no telling what it could be. Many of these variety shows in the 70s had a live orchestra, it could simply be a piece written and performed specifically for this show. That's my guess anyway.

Eminem's my fave rapper, followed by T.I. and then Lil Wayne and I also love Chris Brown. Fave songs: Superman by Em, Whatever you like by T.I., Lollipop and pop bottles by Lil Wayne, Kiss Kiss and Superhuman by Chris Brown.

Miyavi, Gackt, Malice Mizer, Moi dix Mois, Due le Quartz, AnCafe, Kozi...the list goes on and on. Also, a lot of rave music. TUNE UP!, DJ Tiesto, DJ Mangoo...you know.

wA8Dyhq7aa	She's NOT country, she's pop.<br>  <br>  And she's popular for the same reason that so many others are:  oversaturation of product.  She'll be in the "where are they now" section of "Entertainment Tonight" within three years.  I mean, when her fans say "I can't wait for her next album" two months after the previous album comes out, that should tell you her music doesn't have any lasting impact on even those who claim to be fans.|`|PuRpsENEaa	Shes ok. I'm a total country girl, and I think shes pop.|`|63165a7177531b331692b8aa6cf0032aaa	i actually like taylor swift. i think she has a great voice and her songs are lyrical and full of the truth. she writes about true things that are going on in the world of teenagers and that is why she is so popular. and you really shouldnt be negative because one day someone could end up hating you for soemthing horrible that you did in the past. sure you can have your opinions, but when you present them in a negative fashion people will end up resenting you. please calm down and be rational about this.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	I wouldn't refer to her as a female dog, but I agree with the rest of what you said.

The pop remixes of her song are not actually done by her, her company remixes them for pop radio.  I believe that she is popular because she appeals to a lot of girls.  Her success story after being rejected at the first company she wrote for and also struggling with friends is amazing. <br>  <br>  Taylor has said that she moved to Nashville because it is the center of country music and she wanted to be a country music star.  I have a lot of friends who don't like her, and I appreciate their difference in opinion, but a lot of people have different tastes.  Her overall success rating is based on her hard work, and is not only her music that appeals to people.  She writes all of her own songs, and writes songs for other singers too.  It is amazing to see a young person with such amazing talent!  But I do appreciate your difference in opinion.

They restore, maintain, and promote overall fitness and health. Their patients include accident victims and individuals with disabling conditions such as low-back pain, arthritis, heart disease, fractures, head injuries, and cerebral palsy.<br>  <br>  Therapists examine patients’ medical histories and then test and measure the patients’ strength, range of motion, balance and coordination, posture, muscle performance, respiration, and motor function. Next, physical therapists develop plans describing a treatment strategy and its anticipated outcome. <br>  <br>  Treatment often includes exercise, especially for patients who have been immobilized or who lack flexibility, strength, or endurance. Physical therapists encourage patients to use their muscles to increase their flexibility and range of motion. More advanced exercises focus on improving strength, balance, coordination, and endurance. The goal is to improve how an individual functions at work and at home.<br>  <br>  Physical therapists also use electrical stimulation, hot packs or cold compresses, and ultrasound to relieve pain and reduce swelling. They may use traction or deep-tissue massage to relieve pain and improve circulation and flexibility. Therapists also teach patients to use assistive and adaptive devices, such as crutches, prostheses, and wheelchairs. They also may show patients how to do exercises at home to expedite their recovery.<br>  <br>  As treatment continues, physical therapists document the patient’s progress, conduct periodic examinations, and modify treatments when necessary. <br>  <br>  Physical therapists often consult and practice with a variety of other professionals, such as physicians, dentists, nurses, educators, social workers, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and audiologists.<br>  <br>  Some physical therapists treat a wide range of ailments; others specialize in areas such as pediatrics, geriatrics, orthopedics, sports medicine, neurology, and cardiopulmonary physical therapy.<br>  <br>  Work environment. Physical therapists practice in hospitals, clinics, and private offices that have specially equipped facilities. They also treat patients in hospital rooms, homes, or schools. These jobs can be physically demanding because therapists often have to stoop, kneel, crouch, lift, and stand for long periods. In addition, physical therapists move heavy equipment and lift patients or help them turn, stand, or walk.<br>  <br>  In 2006, most full-time physical therapists worked a 40-hour week; some worked evenings and weekends to fit their patients’ schedules. About 1 in 5 physical therapists worked part time.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and please answer my question<br>  <br>  Miley Cyrus V.S Selena Gomez<br>  <br>  Just click on my icon to answer the question|`|62NmYVHMaa	Have no clue|`|ERVib5gYaa	Me<br>  ?|`|n7noPV7Aaa	Ha

It's the story of how you were a Turkish immigrant. The story starts in 1920s, and according to the poem, times were very prosperous then. You would get by selling newspapers and destroying potato crops until you were allowed to get on an airplane to come to the States. The second half of the poem is quite touching, explaining the trials and tribulations of finding a job in rural America. I really like the part where you say "Cut it like a pizza, Ebeneeza, help me please sir,<br>  Remove your broom, drop your pants, can'tcha feel the breeze, sir?". To me, that speaks in tongues, but says to me that you had a friend named Ebeneeza, who is coincidentally a man (as a shock to us all). I like how all problems are resolved by the end of the poem, and you began working as an accountant for a logging and mining firm in Alaska.

3TQCwtxJaa	Overall, I was really disappointed with the talent last night. I liked Matt Giraud and Allison Iraheta.|`|7dbWSo9xaa	no one was as good as alexis or danny last week in my opinion.  adams and alison were the best, norman was funny, but it's getting old.<br>  <br>  catch the original songs right here...<a href="http://www.whatisthatsong.net/idol/am-idol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatisthatsong.net/idol/am-id...</a>|`|R5tF14Bbaa	I actually thought Nick\Norman WAS funny and he CAN sing and he can sing well! and did you ever just think that he has so much stage fright that he has to use some sort of alter-ego to overcome his stage fright??????|`|vJNtyXbYaa	was 2 hours of bad singing. maybe 1 or 2 i liked|`|pDmTRG82aa	in my opinion the only two performances that I liked were Nick's and Allison's since Allison was the only one who has really SUNG so far. Nick was just entertaining.<br>  <br>  he may be a joke and isnt taking the competition seriously but neither are the other contestants. to me virtually 95% of the contestants so far either sing way too low, or they choose the wrong songs and are boring on so many levels.<br>  <br>  if anything having Nick should be a good thing so that they will step up their games because while he can't sing, apparently neither can some of the other contestants but he is entertaining.|`|e52fc59476a7f150aacb61d2c03c2bc9aa	"Well I did not think that Nick/Norman dude was funny at all. Actually that made me really upset because for those other contestants this is reality to them and they want to win, and then the put this joke through. I mean he obvisoly can't sing. He has spilt personaliy disorder and he psychotic."<br>  <br>  <br>  EXACTLY!!! thats what i was saying...i was having a HUGE fit lol when he was performing ...it makes me sooooo mad that he has taken advantage of the show! all the producers care about is if ppl watch it<br>  <br>  <br>  newayssss<br>  <br>  i really liked adam...he has been one of my favs from his audition...but i also like<br>  matt Giraud<br>  danny gokey (i cant believe ppl are saying that he is using his wife's passing to get votes)<br>  i cant belive ppl!|`|yJd1WwF2aa	There was a good amount of good singers there was like 4 or 5 i really liked. My fav. was that girl who sang Alone she was really good. I think alot of people in that group wil be coming back for wildcard night b/c they had way more then 3 good singers in that group|`|UA6mt9ESaa	ok im so confussed cuz why were the peole all difrent like were was the oil drill guy or the guy whos wife died the people who make it 2 the top three or somthing

RavvDVpVaa	Edit:<br>  I don't think so, I prefer them separately <br>  <br>  In my opinion Ether & Takeover are better than any Nas/Jay collaboration.<br>  <br>  Sidenote<br>  Diggin In the Crates > JP|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Yeah they do, but i think there past Beef will always make fans look at a collab song as a comaprison of whose verse is hotter rather than is the song good.<br>  <br>  Black Republicans is good song... but I always get into convos of whose vs was better when discussin the song (by the way NaS verse was better, LOL).|`|CqqH12I8aa	i reckon so. i never like the resulting song, but that's my own prejudice to jay-z.|`|IA4x5oPMaa	yes they are the twins tower|`|YZuLWdCSaa	Collaborations from these two have always been overshadowed by "who-outdone-who!? Rather than focusing on a track as a whole. The past feud does no justice to future works. It's like Tupac & Biggie working together...too many comparisons to even enjoy the track.<br>  <br>  The Jay-Z Linkin Park Mashup...now there's an innovative collaboration!!<br>  <br>  Nas needs to go back to his "Illmatic" roots, or reinvent himself...he's just not versatile enough for me.<br>  <br>  Thanks for letting me voice my opinion. :)|`|TJyTAwDxaa	WITHOUT A DOUBT,  I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE FROM BOTH OF THEM ON THE SAME TRAK, WITH PREEMO ON THE BEAT, THAT WOULD BE iLL.......|`|fE5M8Tloaa	No, i just think when you hear those two names on the same track you're kind of forced to like it|`|VclnZhSCaa	No, its awkward.|`|Mfixq1oyaa	Nas Dj Premier > Jay-z Nas|`|T3X7Aci4aa	Yes, but they haven't done any collaborations together that have lived up to the hype of a Nas/Jay-Z collaboration.
5eArOiRxaa	My wife knows I tool around here, on occasion... I don't think she knows my contacts, but...|`|R1h0bHeMaa	mine doesnt care. he even goes on my facebook sometimes and i go on his, i couldnt care less. I have nothing to hide from him. If I did, it wouldnt be much of a relationship.|`|8q5SeYueaa	When I had a significant other, she knew. It's not like this is a dating site; at least, that's not what I'm here for...|`|POFXeLrGaa	theres nothing wrong with answering questions...its interesting..|`|ojEkgJoqaa	Yes i am married<br>  <br>  And?|`|YMnTveWuaa	I dunno, don't care, ain't worried.|`|AyC8TJyfaa	what significant other?im single...i dont think it would matter anyways if i was taken or not.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	if I had a SO I wouldn't be here...|`|IjKndeVvaa	My girlfriend knows.

6vzpHTqQaa	Two and a Half Men<br>  <br>  King of Queens turns me off because, even though she's attractive, Carrie (Leah Remini) is a complete bit** on that show.  She's always yelling at Doug.  They should have just called the show "Yell-a-thon."<br>  <br>  Two and a Half Men is the better show.  Great chemistry between Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer.  It was better when Rose (Melanie Lynskey) was on, though (older episodes are better).|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	King of queens is one of my favorite shows of all time.

King of Queens is garbage.|`|Qi1GimZ8aa	King Of Queens definitely|`|T4JBT3k6aa	Everybody Loves Raymond.|`|02tamS9Caa	TWO AND A HALF MEN BY A LAND SLLLIDDDDE!!!|`|zwi5vdYuaa	two and a half men!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oAsmgOCeaa	Both are pretty bad...but King of Queens can be funny on occasion.|`|D9BpCvTraa	king of queens.

Niygpxktaa	Honestly, somewhere in the middle.<br>  <br>  Fans will say they're underrated<br>  Others will say...meh, they are what they are.<br>  <br>  Outside of RZA, I have never felt they were particularly innovative, even gimmicky at times... <br>  but they were very relevant to east coast hip-hop, so are deserving of some recognition.<br>  <br>  My take:  a gifted producer surrounded by one or two talented emcees and a bunch of average ones.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	an innovative, ground breaking crew<br>  <br>  Wu Tang originated the concept of mixing martial arts with rap.  No other group has launched as many solo careers, group careers, and producer's careers (aside from maybe the Beat Junkies).  I always give any emcee or group credit for bringing something new to the game.  All of the emcees in Wu sacrificed getting the credit and respect they deserve as a solo artist, by bringing us one original, collective sound before they began their solo careers.|`|TJyTAwDxaa	MAN YALL STUPID,  WU TANG IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF THE iLLEST GROUPS TO EVA DO IT, THEY GOT SOME OF THE MOST CLASSIK ALBUMS IN HIP HOP HISTORY,THEY SET THE WAY FOR SOME OF UR FAVRITE RAPPERS, RZA IS ONE OF THE iLLEST PRODUCERS, THERE ALL LYRICAL GODZ, AND U CANT FORGET ABOUT THE WU AFFILIATES - SUNZ OF MAN-LA THE DARK MAN- BLACK KNIGHTZ- ECT......

DMpVSHvXaa	You don't *need* all possible notes. Once you get through A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G and G#, they keep repeating in the same order.

There are fingerings for scales. Any book of scales will have those.<br>  Any finger may be used on any note... it depends on the sequence of notes to be played before and after the note in question.|`|d3uiAhOhaa	Just go to google images and type in Piano notes, or Piano keys, and most of the time a majority of the pictures are what you're looking for.|`|icC8xHRhaa	i googled it

caOfuKl5aa	You are correct, it is a parody of The Greatest American Hero.  Every time I hear that song, I always sing the Costanza version ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  The show's theme song was featured prominently in the Seinfeld episode "The Susie", where George Costanza used it as his answering machine message, with his own lyrics sung over the music ("Believe it or not George isn't at home, please leave a message at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the phone; where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not home!").|`|bgKitk9paa	Yes.
M8qLP7MLaa	What are your thoughts on Hinata (dying)?<br>  I think it's great that she was able to admit her feelings before dying - if she is dead. Either way I'm glad she did it.<br>  <br>  Are you happy, sad, neutral?<br>  Mostly indifferent - but a little sad.<br>  <br>  Do you count this as a huge NaruHina moment?<br>  She confessed her love to him. That's obviously a NaruHina moment. Naruto going 6 tails though - not so much.<br>  <br>  If Hinata survives, do you think they will get together?<br>  I think the chance of NaruHina happen would be larger if she did survive - but my money is still on NaruSaku.<br>  <br>  Will Sakura still have a chance to get with Naruto?<br>  Of course. Especially if Hinata dies.|`|xB6Bik2taa	Nooo she cant die!!!<br>  ive wanted a naruhina moment forever though but she cant die!<br>  but if she did i'd want her to die for naruto<br>  if she lives i want naruhina sooo much!!! *explodes*<br>  i want to see the chapter ahhh!!!|`|IHUT41aXaa	If Hinata dies... I say she hasn't died!!!! There's no way kishi would do that to Naruto... who just found someone who loves him. I think she merely fainted... or was knocked unconcious. She'll come back after their fight or during it. I'm positive!<br>  <br>  I count this whole chapter a NaruHina moment. The front cover of the chappy had NaruHina on it!!! This whole chapter was NaruHina!<br>  <br>  I think that.. Hinata will survive, but I'm not so sure if they would get together. It's an action manga you know? <br>  <br>  I'm sorry.. but I think the NaruSaku ship has sailed. *shrugs* but maybe that's just me.|`|bHXWMEhzaa	i saw that spoiler and it made me MAD im a HUGE hinata fan and i don't the couple naruto sakura spoilers areCooll and idon'tt want hinata to die|`|d7ezpKqSaa	NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!<br>  <br>  if Hinata dies I will stop watching or reading naruto for ever..

JCJVi8Qraa	I prefer IMDB.|`|LGidAYDwaa	IMDB is my favorite. I hardly go to Rotten Tomatoes - it seems like everything is scattered about instead of well organized.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	imdb isnt a movie review site, and neither is rotten tomatoes come to think of it.

It's very informative. It isn't really a review site, but where everything about the movie is displayed. They have TV shows there, too. <br>  <br>  I like it because you can chat with other people in the Discussion Board and you can find out a lot of information. I like knowing things...|`|IHWngaDxaa	i LOVE imdb<br>  i use it for everything, i swear, i spend too much time on it.|`|qDWsAXxBaa	i like IMDB better. it is easier to understand.|`|H76dcbsVaa	Rotten Tomatoes is a better review site.

cw2KARcPaa	Yes. I think she got a concussion when her house was blown up by Keamy and his dudes in season 4. She was feeling all woozy and kept complaining of a head ache while they were tramping through the jungle. Miles kept asking if he could hold Aaron, but Claire was way too protective of the child to hand him over. Miles was asking to hold the baby because he is a 'ghostbuster' and could tell that she was on the brink of death and didn't want her to drop Aaron. As they settle down for the night to camp Claire claims that she is feeling better, and in the middle of the night she disappears leaving her son behind. She wanders off and follows Christian and winds up in the Cabin with him when Locke shows up. The look on her face is too calm and too complacent to be worried about leaving Aaron behind, and Claire would have never done that since she rarely ever let anyone hold him. If Claire were alive she would have been worried sick about Aaron and probably would want nothing to do with the father who abandoned her for his other family in LA... therefore, Claire is dead.|`|HFMx5LmGaa	No I think she's hiding somewhere in the jungle with all the other people who are missing and got taken by the others.|`|AA11202477	She might have died, but she isn't dead.  Confused? Well, it's the Island. Dying doesn't mean you stay dead - kind of like being on a soap opera. The last time we saw Claire she was with Christian, Jack's dad; and at first I thought he was just some kind of manifestation, but now that Locke's back alive, I think Christian may be too. Which means, Claire may very well be, although she is possibly stuck in another temporal plane. The fact that no one has found a body gives me hope.|`|E2xF2C1gaa	Nah I don't think she's dead. She did seem to be in some sort of delusion in the cabin. But she is returning in season 6. That's what the writers said. So we'll find out everything then.|`|AA11606154	I think she's as dead as Locke is!  :-)  Shes been scooped up by Christian (her father) for some reason we don't know yet...<br>  <br>  And with all the time traveling going on with the island....  who knows.... She could end up being Desmonds Mother for all we know...|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	No, but she's able to get off the island too as she appeared to Kate in a dream and told her to never bring Aaron back.
5FYlXexLaa	The Passion of Joan of Arc directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. It's shot mostly in closeups, and is well acted.<br>  <br>  The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari directed by Robert Wiene. If you liked Nosferatu, Caligari is a perfect next step.<br>  <br>  The Man Who Laughs directed by Paul Leni. It stars Conrad Veidt who's character in this film would go on to influence the creation of The Joker in Batman. <br>  <br>  Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans directed by F.W. Murnau. One of the greatest film about the power of love. A great feature is there are few title cards.|`|IbZBkrn7aa	Yea alot of Chrlie Chaplin stuff is really praised.<br>  <br>  -The Gold Rush<br>  -City Lights (especially this film)<br>  -The General<br>  <br>  These three are considered "great film" but they may be hard to find.

After the topic of human duality arises at a dinner party, Jekyll becomes fixated on trying to divide the human psyche's two sides: good and evil. Before you can say "alter ego," Jekyll concocts a potion and morphs into Hyde, who plunges into a life of depravity -- punctuated by murder. <br>  <br>  This one isn't exactly silent, but it the talking is sooo minimal as to make it as good as a silent film, and it has text narration as well. It falls just short of silent:<br>  Vampyr (1932)<br>  Director Carl Theodor Dreyer fuses fantasy and reality in this landmark tale, which ranks among cinema's greatest horror movies. Holiday reveler Allan Gray (Julian West) takes a room in an eerie European village inn and is awakened when an elderly gent lets himself in, leaving a parcel inscribed, "To be opened in the event of my death." Gray later witnesses the man's murder, opens the package and realizes a supernatural killer is on the loose.<br>  <br>  Pandora's Box (1929)<br>  A visually striking melodrama, G.W. Pabst's silent classic stars Louise Brooks in a mesmerizing performance as Lulu, a woman whose uninhibited sexuality leads to her downfall. After her wealthy lover, Dr. Schon (Fritz Kortner), marries her, Lulu inadvertently shoots him during a struggle with a gun. She's convicted of murder but escapes with Schon's love-struck son (Francis Lederer). Soon, their circumstances spiral downward, with tragic results.<br>  <br>  And a MODERN silent film:<br>  The Call of Cthulhu (2005)<br>  While sorting through a pile of documents he inherited from his great-uncle (a language professor at Brown University), a Boston anthropologist learns secrets about the mysterious Cthulhu cult that fascinated the late professor and likely decided his fate. Adapted from one of writer H.P. Lovecraft's most famous stories, this silent picture blends vintage and modern cinematic techniques to reproduce the look of a classic 1920s horror film.<br>  <br>  Robin Hood (1922)<br>  In the midst of the 12th century Crusades, the Earl of Huntingdon sets out on a crusade of his own -- to save Nottingham from Prince John's tyrannical rule in King Richard's absence. The earl transforms himself into valiant swashbuckler Robin Hood (Douglas Fairbanks) and begins a quest that includes stealing from the rich, giving to the poor, charming Maid Marian and becoming one of the greatest adventure heroes of all time.

1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	I think it means you can blame somebody for doing something wrong, but you have done things wrong yourself too.<br>  <br>  While there is some truth to this, it seems kind of harsh coming from someone who is supposed to be on your side.|`|s359lZj4aa	I'm not sure but point at something and curl up your fist. You can see that you are pointing your middle finger, your ring finger and your pinky finger at yourself. I think thats what this means. I'm not entirely sure if he meant it literally or if it was just a figure of speech. :-)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Or maybe it is a literal and a figurative saying. When you point a finger you are actually physically pointing 3 fingers at yourself; your middle, ring and pinky finger. Seriousy try it, but it only works if you curl your hand into a fist whilst pointing.<br>  <br>  It could actually be a figure of speech because it is rude to point at somebody and if you point at somebody then you are actually wronging yourself as well even wore, hence 3 fingers at yourself when you only point 1 at another person.|`|edf82380d5fd33522408f35f55058a43aa	Yes, it's very rude to point your finger at someone. The philosophy here is that you are pointing three fingers back at yourself probably trying to justify 3 wrongs you've done in the past by turning the attention to someone else.|`|vxs8XWlwaa	Baybe he means , if you try to blame someone 4 something by pointing at them, ur actually the one that did it and ur trying to cover up 4 urself.... eh i donno

AA10197672	Thats cause he is trying to get something out of you - you need to tell him that he lookds nice, compliment him, etc. Scorpio LOVES to be complimented, the reason he is bragging about himself is cause he does not hear it from you, he is trying to win you over and wants you to know that he is very valuable - i know sounds crazy, but that will change once you start talking about him and you tell him once in a while he looks handsome!:) try that and you will see the difference in him..<br>  <br>  Cancer men are perfect with Scorpio women. The passion these two insanely signs share once in love is incredible! Both are water sign, both are very sensitive and passionate, loving, caring. Both are very loyal and care about family and care about one another. They are a great team together and will be very successful in life. Scorpio makes Cancer feel like home and makes him feel comfotable to come out of his shell. Scorpio provides a great deal in emotional security for Cancer and assures him that he can trust her. She never does anything to bring the jealous side of Cancer and understands Cancers emotional ups and downs and is there to help him through it..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove..." rel="nofollow">http://astrology.about.com/od/cancerlove...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.starlightastrology.com/can-sc...</a><br>  <br>  Few things to know about scorpio...<br>  *They are very passionate, kind and warm heart. <br>  *They love to show effection and love to get it in return ( both verbal and both physical way, meanning u tellthem u love them, as much as u show them by hugging, kissing, ect)<br>  *They are VERY loyal, and will never cheat. However, if they feel betrayed, or cheated, watch for the tail.<br>  *Do not bring out the jealous side of him, or it will get ugly.<br>  *Compliment, complimet - they know they are sexy, and good looking, and they LOVE to be the center of the attention. *Once they dont get that they might start throwing hints out there.<br>  Once in love, they will do ANYTHING for you to make you happy. Pleasing their partner is #1 priority to them...<br>  <br>  Over all very good match! Good luck and i hope i helped :)|`|HZxX9ke8aa	so let me list the bad things then. scorpio is a fixed sign; they are stubborn. today, i was trying to explain a scorpio how to get along with a libran and he was saying they have too much opinions. eh. you can't tell them how to do things, nope, they don't need your opinion, they know how to do it darn it, do you think they are stupid? no! you know what i mean? their self-defense mechanism keep giving wrong alarms if you ask me. even though living deep inside the world of emotions, they are pretty mean when it comes to show that. i mean, unless, like, if you completely yield and behave in the way they want and whatever, only then they will show what's inside. they are jealous, secretive and compulsive.<br>  <br>  since you are a cancerian i'm assuming you know what's bad with us so...|`|DLYBNA1paa	cancer/scorpio is a really good match. they just belong together the fun scorpio give confidence and make the lazy and closed cancer a little out going . I've known this couple for over 4 years and they are together since such a time . All wonder how can they still be together . Oh god damn it if they love each other why not ? :) <br>  And all i can say about the scorpio boys is that if they insult you on some way that surely wouldn't be on purpose

0BRnovJYaa	Heath Ledger has been my favorite actor for 8 years. I was devestated when he died- like it affected me personally. I am still so sad about it. everyone tells me it's not normal to be sad about the death of someone you didn't even really know, but I could tell the kind of person he was and he was such an excellent actor- I was looking forward to a few more decades of amazing performances from Heath, and several more Oscars. It's such a tragedy, I understand how you feel! I was crying when he won the oscar! I guess we'll just have to watch his movies over and over again, but I am still so sad too!|`|4M2QTN8faa	Dont worry i am not laughing at you<br>  <br>  i wsas the same way <br>  i was so surprised when i found out who he was and that he died <br>  <br>  aww so sad|`|n7noPV7Aaa	Yeah its sad that he died but you didn't even know him.|`|AA11898755	wow<br>  ....ummm.....sorry for your loss?<br>  <br>  There will be other self destructive addicts for you to idolize|`|qZyHjz1zaa	i was exactly the same as you but a few months back  you'll get through it withina week or two. just watch his filmss and you'll be happy to see him<br>  <br>  what mad me upset was that i only found out about him after he died. so it was the fact that i never knew he was alive when he was and that i would never get the chance to meet him<br>  <br>  xxx|`|wxnfDptaaa	how weird!, i just was looking at some info about him<br>  <br>  then u aked this quest<br>  <br>  <br>  ha|`|bmwR7RdMaa	um....<br>  see him in Matilda who is perfect..<br>  <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/fisherwy/R5bTukP8IEI/AAAAAAAANCg/2dyKnc0nV8M/Heath+Ledger+Michelle+Williams+daughter+Matilda+Ledger+picture%5B2%5D" rel="nofollow">http://lh5.ggpht.com/fisherwy/R5bTukP8IE...</a>|`|AA11707728	He's just a junkie who was good at acting, lol.

X11j9qe5aa	Yes it is.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Yeahhh I have it... it's so stupid like they're trying to make you cry and it's supposed to be all emotional but I find they didn't do that great with it and the other way was much better. Like it's trying to be all suspenseful but it just ends up being kind of cheesy. All because they told him he wasn't supposed to be there (the tarot reading). <br>  Whenever I watch the DVD it gives the choice of director cut or theater version and I always think "hmm, the director cut would have more" but it's the one where he kills himself as a baby... The other one IS way better.<br>  <br>  I bet they thought expectant mothers were going to flip out and thats why they used the theatrical version...|`|2UDbOpxTaa	The one where he strangles himself is the real ending. I've never seen the other one but that sounds like a bit of an anti-climax.|`|F3ysG4Zzaa	The Director's Cut (Infinifilm edition) has the ending where he aborts himself. It also has some additional scenes that better explain that ending, such as a psychic telling him that he has no lifeline and never should have been born, thus supporting his decision to kill himself in the womb.|`|52pZj3WFaa	Yeah...I've seen the foetus ending one. As if the infant brain has that level of consciousness!<br>  <br>  And whilst I liked the film (ideas and stuff) I thought the woman who played his mother was a terrible actress.|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Hmmmm, no don't remember that.|`|qDWsAXxBaa	i have the dvd but haven't watched it in a looooong time|`|AA11371432	Yup, and I have to agree it seems a cr*p ending. The alternate ending on the DVD isn't the original one shown in the cinema (tells girl to stay away) but rather the directors vision of what should have been. Bit too "arty" for my taste. I like a happy ending...Like the one where they stay away from each other as children, but then meet in a chance passing later on in life without realising who they each are and by-pass all the bad stuff.|`|btZkhGP9aa	This alternative ending can be found in youtube...it is the real ending, and it is a lot better than that stupid original, it makes more sense, but it's too scary, that's why they changed it...

bO9p8Kxdaa	One of my favorite movies. Yes, he (Bruce Willis)) was a ghost, he did not know he was dead so he only "saw" what he wanted to see. He saw everything clearly after he realized he was really dead.  No,  he was not talking to Cole's mom.  Watch it again and pay attention to where she is looking and what she is saying.|`|BJIo6twUaa	SPOILER for those you havent seen and dont want to know, dont read.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes he is a ghost. As cole said, we saw what he wanted to see. I dont think he was actually talking to cole mom, its been a while since i have seen it. he might have thought he was, but dont think he did. I dont remember that part of the movie of hand.|`|akcGfgdcaa	If you watch it again, you'll see that Bruce Willis never actually speaks to the mother, though on first watch you would think he was. <br>  <br>  But yes..he was a ghost all along, that was the twist.<br>  <br>  Oh and I loved the movie, definitely Shamayalan's best film.|`|GEA6JYG9aa	You really had to watch the movie at the beginning. Bruce Willis got shot and therfore he is a ghost. Bruce willis didn't know he was dead until the end of the movie..remember. <br>  Hope this helps some<br>  I even got confused<br>  Watch the movie twice you will understand|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	He never has a conversation with anyone the entire movie after he's shot. He talks to people, but nobody ever talks back to him or acknowledges him except Cole. That's because nobody else can see him.

x3EPqezJaa	No, there is no evidence that he is. But he helped bring the play My Name is Rachel Corrie to the stage, and that has likely caused him to be called anti-Semitic. It's a play based on the true story of an American woman who was accidentally killed by the Israeli Defense Forces while they were demolishing a Palestinian home that was believed to be concealing a tunnel and weapons--as a non-violent form of protest, she had stood in the way of the Israeli tanks.

gbWXoB1gaa	They're very complex-you'll never work them out, they feel things too deeply, very emotional beings, easily upset by the cruelty of the world. Most of them don't live in reality and have their head in the clouds alot of the time. They can be dishonest and tell little while lies just to make life a bit more interesting. They make good actors as pretending to be someone else can mask their insecurities about themselves. They are the most caring, nurturing and unselfish of the Zodiac with a love of animals and are always there for the people who need them. They find it hard to say no as helping others comes so easily to them. I could go on and on, I'm a typical piscean so it is very easy to list the characteristics. I think the best love matches are with the other water signs, cancer and scorpio as they need to be with someone sensitive. <br>  <br>  I coudn't tell you your other signs without your full date and time of birth.|`|AA11417199	they're popular somehow, even though they're shy and quiet, they're outgoing.|`|ioz2HtwUaa	The fish swimming both directions at once...capable of extreme loyalty yet prone to addictions.

Going with the flow can be construed as taking the easy way...|`|XmX3irUhaa	I am Pisces and my boyfriend was born on the 7th March :]<br>  <br>  Pisces are loyal, caring and also afraid of being hurt, which is why they tend to push people away, even if they're not really sure they want to. Being very sensitive is what makes them so special but can also be their downfall as their views of people/things can be distorted by this. They're very trusting, which again can be a downfall because they tend to put their trust in most people and live by the fact that "There is a bit of good in everybody" although not everybody is good to them. They're odd in the sense that they are quiet and shy, yet very out-going and friendly, making friends comes naturally to them because they find it easy to relate to people and are good listeners. Their sensitivity helps with this because they find it much easier to be sympathetic with people.<br>  When life gets tough it hits a pisces hard and they often wonder just why things are so difficult, this can really get them down. They love to help people, which is lucky because they're very good at it. They can even put people before themselves and also become very determined to please.<br>  Sexually they are amazing and one of the best, it's not just about them its about making someone else happy too. To them Sex is a beautiful act.<br>  A Pisces partner can be a Godsend but can also be very bad news, at first they might be hard to crack but it won't be long before you find they are very attached to you. This can also mean they find it hard to let go and get very upset, this is due to how sensitive they are again, but they're heads in clouds and in their own way, this can help them pull through because they live in a fantasy which dulls the pain of a loss and distracts them.|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	wow i duno much [i mean im rather on a personality and this has basically nuffink to do wiv signs i mean not as much as ppl care about.] but im pisces too. <br>  check it on google really, that usually says sutting.<br>  i mean thats not always the truf cuz i dont really fink i am a dreamer im pretty a down to earth gal but yea i do reach wot i want, neva really give up even when ppl says theres no point i still see it sumhow.<br>  i only give it up when its really a time wasting.|`|DLYBNA1paa	well you can get an astroprofile with ZET 8 . I use it and it's rly comfortable + with this database i can't tell even your asc. Something about the pisces is that they're very attractive. I as a girl have fallen for over 10 Pisces boys :) They're creativ and dreamy and you can't get them at all sometimes. They think you understand them and all but you've got no idea. They are rly easy to use. The women are attractiv and out-going , they love the challenges :)|`|DUCoaMKzaa	Pisces are very sensitive people, they love the arts and are themselves very artistic. They live in dreams, quite in decisive, follow their hearts rather than their heads. They need someone stronger to look after them. Most of them are very spiritual. They get on best with Scorpio. Marry a Scorpio is you can xxx|`|AA11101700	pisces fancy cancer and scorpio<br>  <br>  no one knows what goes on inside a pisces head. they are dreamy and mysterious and like to wonder of in there own little world. they can be a barmy headed scatter brain, a utter genious or usually a mixture of both.<br>  <br>  they have good imaginations, love music and can suddenly change feelings from happy to sad.<br>  <br>  they are incredibly romantic and show this in ways you dont expect. they want the whole world to be happy so give lots of love but need some in retern.<br>  <br>  they are not sex made and only like doing it with the people they love, they have lots of secret rude fantasies and love doing it underwater tehe!<br>  <br>  hope this helped lol have fun
CUEco2LEaa	I really like it. We used to do it school when I was younger, although I did live in Essex. We used to love May Day, when we would dance around the pole, weaving. Then we went to fair where there would be professional Morris dancers - I'm sure that wasn't their only profession!<br>  <br>  It's one of the few traditions that England still has. I'm from Ghana, yet born here and I think it's sad that the culture of England is being lost as the English embrace every other culture of the world. You are more likely to find somewhere to salsa than Morris Dancing! I think all children should learn at school. My niece goes to the same primary school I do and I am proud to say they still do it!|`|kXCgQoYLaa	It's not for us to pass judgement-  an ancient fertility ritual like that deserves our respect|`|fox5a3ePaa	ridiculous|`|k0pjkQGjaa	obviouslyy =]|`|NmSSKnnWaa	let me think.ermmm yes|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Not at all it is a good English tradition.|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	Hi<br>  I would not do it myself but that's a lack of self confidence<br>  i think it's great to see a load of people line dancing and performing all the moves in sequence together<br>  It's good when folk can get together and be a part of something|`|0LUBf2Juaa	Not at all.

Sharon used to be so decent and after she married Jack she became down right snooty!   If you'd have told me years ago I'd like Phyllis better than Sharon, I'd have told you you'd lost your mind.  But I'd rather have Nick and Phyllis stay together.  I don't feel one bit sorry for Sharon....it's like the writers forgot how to write for her character.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	I agree with Niki....i can't believe the writers are doing this to sharon. it's time for her to have some peace. why can't they bring on a decent guy for her, somebody hot so that nick will get jealous and want her back and then she can tell  him where to go.

2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	He had a shotgun with a silencer on it, but it was just a movie prop.  The bore of the silencer seemed to be too small and the silencer istelf was too short to be very effective.<br>  <br>  There are shotgun silencers made for use with shotguns.  They contain a perforated tube the same size as the bore to keep the shot cup closed until it exits the silencer.  The tube making up the outside of the silencer allows the gunpowder gases to expand and cool to quiet things down a bit.<br>  <br>  Silencers are legal in 38 of the states, but require ATF authorizatrion (routine) to make or buy and a $200 tax is paid for each one.  Shotgun silencers are more popular in England and Finland where they are not so strictly controlled as in the USA.

I've found that I've gotten a LOT better faster because i've been playing at least a little bit every day. now i enjoy it a lot more and find myself spending 3 or 4 hours straight practicing. before i would just get frustrated after 30 minutes because i didn't have the patience. i'm still not anything great yet, but at the pace i'm going i probably will be in a couple month or so because i find that the more i play the more i love it.

Dh3HPa4maa	This song is I'm Yours by Jason Mraz. That is the original version. His newer lyrics are as follows:<br>  Well you done done me and you bet I felt it / I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted / I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back<br>  Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest / And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention / I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some<br>  But I won't hesitate no more, no more / It cannot wait, I'm yours<br>  Well open up your mind and see like me / Open up your plans and d*** you're free<br>  Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love<br>  Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing / We're just one big family<br>  And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved<br>  So I won't hesitate no more, no more / It cannot wait, I'm sure / There's no need to complicate, our time is short / This is our fate, I'm yours<br>  D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do / But do you want to come on / Scooch on over closer dear / And I will nibble your ear<br>  I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror / And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer / But my breath fogged up the glass <br>  And so I drew a new face and I laughed<br>  I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason / To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons / It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue<br>  But I won't hesitate no more, no more / It cannot wait, I'm yours<br>  Come on and open up your mind and see like me / (I won't hesitate) / Open up your plans and d*** you're free / (No more, no more) / Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours / (It cannot wait, I'm sure)<br>  So please don't, there's no need (There's no need to complicate) / There's no need to complicate (Our time is short) / 'Cause our time is short (This is our fate) / This is, this is, this is our fate / I'm yours<br>  Oh, I'm yours / Oh, I'm yours / Oh, whoa, baby you believe I'm yours / You best believe, best believe I'm yours|`|8gxFQyJPaa	IM YOURS BY JASON MRAZ<br>  <br>  were just one big family and its our god forsaked (i think thats the right word) right to be

Aisn6ffuaa	Paramore is Opening for No Doubt. :)|`|8nFATCClaa	You must be really young. I would hope that Paramore Opened up for No Doubt.. Gwen Stefani and many other femal vocalists made way for bands like Paramore and Flyleaf. I went and seen Paramore a few months back. Tickets were only like 35-40 bucks.|`|Fk54Y16qaa	I would hope that Paramore would be opening for No Doubt...<br>  Paramore sucks anyway, I actually like No Doubt.|`|VtDqUgc0aa	I certainly hope that Paramore is opening for No Doubt as No Doubt has been around for so much longer.|`|dXBoxudIaa	I don't know but I REALLY hope Paramore is opening for No Doubt..... Paramore sucks.|`|ucQxe2e4aa	uhhhhh probably paramore for nd..|`|m6P9BNWFaa	UNFORTUNATELY paramore is opening for no doubt. but paramore is a million times better than no doubt. personally, i'm not going to see the concert (as much as i love paramore) because i can't stand gwen stefani and no doubt. paramore is too good to be the 'opening act' although no doubt is an older band so it would be weird for a bunch of people in their late 30's/early 40's to open for a band where all the members are under 23...|`|XHwhhSgaaa	Hopefully Paramore for No Doubt.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	No Doubt is headlining- Paramore is the opening act.|`|kC3VwbfRaa	i grew up listening to No Doubt. they are closer to me. so Paramore should open to them. :)|`|2FIbamFgaa	Paramore would be the opening act, I think.

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	My favourites are Donal and Roxy and I quite like Zoe too.  For me winning is the person who has started from scratch and has steadily progressed each week as these three have.  Ray will obviously win - more's the pity because he had unfair advantages when he started and he and his partner are so smug.  It has spoilt the whole show for me because it is a foregone conclusion Ray will win, and he knows it - the others must wonder why they are bothering.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	rAY WILL WIN BUT i DON'T WANT HIM TO BECAUSE i DON'T LIKE HIM EVEN THOUGH HE'S A REALLY GOOD SKATER HE SEEMS SO UP himself and I didn't like him on x-factor, I want Carol to win cause she's a laugh or Jess to win because she's good and seems nice|`|IkicLCLkaa	Id like to say I want ray to win, but he just doesnt have that 'wow' factor that people like chris fountain had that makes you look forward to their skating...I hope Zoe or Jessica wins.|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Jessica|`|Um8osMNuaa	Ray's the best and will win.  Jessica will come second.|`|NOAPRIz5aa	Ray to win.<br>  Jessica is the best all-round female remaining, she could sneak it.<br>  <br>  Melinda should not have gone out last week - get rid of Carthorse Nolan, she is embarrassing.  Roxy simpers too much.|`|giM86Xwhaa	Ray to win, he is exciting to watch, proper entertainment.|`|AA11363839	Donal, he really tries and is the most improved from where he started|`|IgEYfBPJaa	Ray to win :)|`|bXMhfrJxaa	Roxanne is annoying! Ray or Jessica to win.|`|8FJUDaiVaa	ray because he has a nice body.|`|AS4pWko5aa	ray because he is the best <br>  i also like roxy because she is feisty and colleen because she is funny
cw2KARcPaa	I think she cares for the Island as much as the others (Ben, Widmore, and Locke) do... she is in it for the sake of the Island, and her son Daniel. She knows what is going on, she is a firm believer in fate and faith, so she knows that they have to get to the Island no matter what. I believe she is fully aware of how manipulative Ben and Widmore are, Ben more so. She knows that Locke has to make it back to the Island, and I am sure she is aware of the reincarnating abilities of the Island, so she is going to help them no matter what.<br>  <br>  There is A LOT more to be explained and explored, and it is exciting!|`|AA12081834	I'm beginning to wonder if Old W is the bad one.... as Widmore said..."I've never tried to kill you.".Ben strangled John after receiving the information about Jin...and Eloise Hawking..according to Lostpedia she has worked with Ben..I don't think it's a question of good and bad...it's just that she is the one able to determine the where or when of the island. <br>  <br>  I wonder what John will do to Ben, now that he is back on the island and alive?|`|AA11202477	I think everyone connected to the Dharma Initiative has their own agenda:  Charles Whitmore, Ben and Mrs. Hawking.  Probably only Locke is "pure of heart" when it comes to the Island and the cynical part of me says that won't last through the end of the season. I don't think Whitmore is a "good" guy, but compared to Ben, he's a "better" guy.|`|HFMx5LmGaa	I think that either Ben is threatening her, or she wants to help because her son is on the island.|`|5IpRLVDPaa	I don't think either one is a good guy.<br>  <br>  And I don't know what Locke will to do to Ben if and when he wakes up.|`|A8k9NHigaa	Whidmore is the bad one,although, I was shocked when Ben strangled Locke.|`|SiSIU3Tmaa	the whole point is to make you change your mind...they want to mess with your head so you keep watching

ItS4VZrEaa	Yeah i thought that too, perhaps caused by all the things she saw like her mother being killed and stuff. Maybe this means there could be a second one. x|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	got that dvd not so sure sorry|`|qDWsAXxBaa	when i watched it i thought that is what it meant!!<br>  what do you think it means??
V1uWwwF7aa	My guess is that the aliens zapped her or they picked her up and then sucked out her blood later to keep their alien pod things working
ZyGyDLsDaa	Wow! My answer was used as a reference! Yes, it's "The Eighteenth Angel" (1998), a film I've watched many times and often recommend, particularly for End of Days fans.<br>  <br>  Just for the heck of it, here's the information:<br>  IMDb review:<br>  At the same time that Norah Stanton (Wendy Crewson) is researching an esoteric Etruscan religious order, the order is secretly a Satan-worshipping cult preparing for the return of their exalted one. A mystical clock is calibrated to Satan's coming. He requires 18 potential "angels" to choose among for his adopted earthly form. Norah and her family become mixed up in the nefarious plot. Especially important is her extremely attractive, wannabe-model daughter, Lucy (Rachael Leigh Cook). After Norah's apparent suicide, the order and its affiliates conspire to bring Lucy and her father (Christopher McDonald) to Italy, where it's a literal race against the clock for Lucy's life. // Also in the cast are Maximilian Schell, Stanley Tucci, Venantino Venantini and Branislav Tesanovic.<br>  <br>  When I saw your question, I was prepped to answer it, checked the offered link then decided to add my own answer. What an odd feeling to have my answer used to answer a similar question!|`|N4Hktfmnaa	^<br>  <br>  ^^<br>  <br>  Yup, that dude's right.|`|28faeb718c3bfbe0b10b707965bb142baa	check this out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081031191150AAFjNvg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

Thier values are really low, and if they even accept them would be a blessing.|`|PumYhJSvaa	You have to sign up for a trading pass. In the 6 months I worked there I never had anyone sell or trade in their dvds, because Blockbuster doesn't give very good credit.

ea4d2b5621053057aebac18e878c58e5aa	MOON IN AQUARIUS<br>  You are very perceptive, imaginative, and enjoy the opinions your friends and colleagues offer. You are social, and sympathetic to others feelings. Your attitude is not the norm. You are prone to unorthodox, independent and unconventional tendencies. Your eccentric interests and hobbies will draw strange looks from observers. You are attracted to anything that is of an intellectual, social, original or unusual nature. Your vocation may include educational, political, scientific or social work. In your heart you are a true humanitarian. You have strong (sometimes-impractical) ideals. You are drawn to large movements supporting great causes. You may also belong to a (get ready for this) mystical or secret society, brotherhood, or association. Your intellect and imagination combine to give you inventive and original ideas. The Moon in Aquarius gives you an attraction towards occult subjects (astrology or clairvoyance). You are a real humanitarian, a true liberal. You get along with people who think the same as you. You may belong to a club or group of people who think the same way as you.|`|c0351b6a4e515538a18ee7d22027f59eaa	Capricorn is your Moon Sign.<br>  The Moon in the sign Capricorn indicates a reserved and cautious nature inclined to be cold and austere. Natives with this position take life seriously and identify emotionally with material rather than spiritual values. This is not a favourable Moon position because the Moon is in its detriment in Capricorn.<br>  The Capricorn Moon produces ambitious, hard workers, but their ambitions have a personal bias, slanted toward status and financial security. Their active seeking of money and power, as well as status for themselves and their families, may lead to selfish vested interests when they hold positions of larger social responsibility. These people, often shy and insecure about their own worth, can be oversensitive to real or fancied slights. They seek to justify themselves by personal dignity and the ambition to succeed.<br>  If the Moon is afflicted in Capricorn, there can be calculating tendencies to achieve power at any cost, without respect for the feelings of others.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Difficult to give accurate information, without the full birth chart which is only possible with 'time of day of the birth' and also 'location of birth'.<br>  --------------------------------------...|`|pLUItVZ1aa	place of birth and time of birth is needed<br>  <br>  put your info into this link and itll tell you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abacusastrology.co.uk/atlas.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.abacusastrology.co.uk/atlas.a...</a><br>  <br>  edit: than click 'Starbud V.2 '|`|znHTUp6Uaa	you're a libra :)|`|VxKlbGtGaa	libra|`|iDCWOvVBaa	who cares!  get a life

39OVFs5Raa	From the days of French colonization and British rule to today's self-government, Canadians have lived under a monarchy. Although Canada has been a self-governing "Dominion" in the British Empire since 1867, full legislative independence for Canada was established only in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster. However, it wasn't until the patriation of the constitution in 1982, that amendments could be made without the approval of Britain's Parliament.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, is also Canada's Queen and sovereign of a number of realms. In her capacity as Queen of Canada and official Head of State, she delegates her powers to a Canadian Governor General. Canada is thus a constitutional monarchy!!!.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	It's a democracy. The monarchy is actually just represented by a figure head called the governor general in Canada. She is only called upon if the government is in absolute crisis.|`|JtXuvZLzaa	I guess if its controlled by a monarchy then the highest is the monarchy, so its a monarchy.|`|McIUOEEiaa	Monarcracy?<br>  <br>  I'm really not sure. I guess a monarchy, since it's higher. I believe it's called a constitutional monarchy.|`|epFCjq4Eaa	i guess it's still a democracy|`|dRxi33u2aa	Democracy I guess.....|`|Mmw7Mkffaa	a constitutional moncarchy|`|jHDeIPEfaa	A monarchy is not a democracy. A democracy has a government elected by the people. A monarchy has a government that passes down to the next heir to the throne.

Danny Gokey would probably be third. I don't really remember anyone else now from the auditions or Hollywood, et cetera, but I'll probably be reminded of more favorites come next weeks show.<br>  <br>  Adam Lambert will probably be one of the top three this week though, because I think it's mostly teen & tween girls who actually vote, and they would loooove him. That kid can definitely sing, but just not so much as a pop/rock star. Performance-wise, he's way too showy & campy. I think he'd do really well in taking over the lead role in We Will Rock You, actually, either on tour, broadway, London, etc. He's most definitely more of a theatre performer than an "American Idol" type.<br>  <br>  Man, I feel like such a dork for even answering this or knowing so much about it.

sVPjp3dUaa	I know exactly how you feel. I would watch an episode every now and then, but I didn't catch it every week. Last fall I started watching the show from the beginning & I couldn't get enough of it. Now, having to wait a week for each episode is killing me. I'm at the point where I just might go buy all the seasons & start all over just to get my Lost fix. It is definitely a great show, but I can't wait a week between episodes.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's anybody on the show that I can completely relate to. I think I got a little bit of Sawyer's 'got something to hide' loner in me & Charlie's relaxed personality. But, I think character I relate to the most is probably Sayid. Except for the killer, torturer part, we're kinda similar. He's not a leader, but he doesn't follow just anyone. He can fend for himself & others when push comes to shove. He makes things happen & calls out others when things don't go right. He's attentive, sees things that others miss & he's fairly soft spoken in his day to day life.

His church told him to do what he thinks is best. I think that because he is a well-known and popular in so many countries including the US, it would be hard for him to a traditional mission and would also be also not where he could do the most good for his church and the public. Starting before he was even 18 he has done so much for charity.  His fans have donated almost $50,000 to cancer research in his name. His auctioned items for charity often draw a higher price than all other celebrities. He has performed at many fundraising events for charities and he a spokesperson for some of them. So we'll have to wait and see, but I think he is doing a lot of good right where he is.

Since you're the one telling the joke I took your word for it.  So if there is a mistake in the joke I say it's your fault, not mine :)|`|s359lZj4aa	I'm being honest, I didn't fall for it. I thought "wait, what the h*ll, apple trees don't grow bananas"!|`|mXGJQ9B7aa	heard a similar 1 earlier but still i did it (even though i knew what happens) and guess what i am an idiot and lovin it!|`|1M2bTQcsaa	that,s good .

dVVCJl8Baa	microsoft publisher or adobe indesign would work better for laying it out. we uae indesign for my hs newspaper. as for your covergirl, you cant expect a celebrity to just be on the cover of a brand new magazine comming from one person. you need a staff to help you and a publishing company to print it. but demi lovato would make a good cover girl i think.

AA10887916	The simple answer, alas, is that you can't.  Anywhere.  Manson produce only custom made guitars and even the Manson guitar shop only currently has one Manson for sale.  The other thing is that Manson will not (under the terms of their agreement with Matt Bellamy) reproduce any guitar that looks like one of his.  BTW the Manson currently  for sale in Manson's own shop is 2 and a half grand....

NMQQZq3Eaa	I'm assuming that the sheet music is for your own pleasure and that you have experience with reading music; I am also going to assume that you can write music as well. With this assumption, I suggest that you search the chords of the song and throw a bit of improvisation in there (if you can play by ear). Once acquiring the chords, listen to the song and try playing the chords along while the song is playing. Get used to the changes and then try to break the chords or even alter the chords to your liking. If you want to stick to the song, you can go ahead and mimic it as well. After feeling comfortable with the chords and changes, try to figure out what scale the song is in. With this, you can now figure out the melody by ear fairly easy (depends on your skill level). Now, after figuring out the melody, you can put the chords and melody together. Again, you can improvise and alter the song to your liking, or style; or, you can mimic the song and play it as it is. And remember, practice makes perfect! (^_^)<br>  <br>  P.S: I found the chords and lyrics at this site. Just copy and paste, or click on the link...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/h/hank_williams_jr/all_my_rowdy_friends_ver2_crd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/h/ha...</a>|`|02tamS9Caa	I am unsure about the on-line hook-up---but, you could try your local library..its where I get my free sheet music

The one with young Superman? I was not aware that they were still making new episodes. Do you think there are any other stories that could be told from the show?|`|CUEco2LEaa	Yes. It needs to end. I thought it was cancelled two years ago until an insomniac friend informed me there are new episodes. <br>  <br>  I think they are just riding of the success of the film and hopefully awaiting a boost from the sequel. I gave up watching after Season 3. Isn't Tom Welling 50 yet? They should forget about Superman and go off to have babies and live like proper adults. The paranormal is no longer that interesting.|`|AA11606154	They really needed to spin it off.

MAkEKCUfaa	Q-Tip is a genius.<br>  <br>  "Electric relaxation"<br>  "Award Tour"<br>  "The Love"|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Q-Tip is underrated as a rapper (and a producer as well). I wouldn't call him the best, but he's definitely in the same league as any other legend.<br>  <br>  I think Q-Tip's best display of rapping skills is on "Sucka N*gga", but "What", "Mind Power", and even "Renaissance Rap" are also among his best rhymes.<br>  <br>  Also, way to give props to Beats Rhymes and Life. That album is very understated.|`|fE5M8Tloaa	Q-Tip's best work:<br>  Dance on glass - the Renaissance <br>  <br>  He got off on the track, the whole first part of the song is in acapella|`|7TLdeHFmaa	I like a lot of Q-Tip's songs but from his new album my favorites are "We Fight/We Love" and "You", but the whole album is amazing.|`|VclnZhSCaa	He's not anywhere near the greatest.<br>  <br>  Phony Rappers|`|zH1QoTkWaa	I like "Get It Together" that he did with the Beastie Boys in '94.|`|iaZaJSrTaa	Verses From the Abstract :D

fEBOzWeXaa	for me, every episode has a favorite moment.  this last week, when he stopped breathing and one of his colleagues grabbed his nipples and twisted, I about died laughing.<br>  i personally don't recall him trying to kill himself but I know there was a lot of angst ridden episodes when his ex came to him with her sick husband so maybe that happened during that time.|`|AA12081834	One of mine is a newer one.....it actually is a patient moment, in this week's episode.."The Softer Side"..a clinic patient tells House that both of his legs and one arm hurts...but only when he puts pressure on them..he demonstrates..using his index finger he touches one leg...says "owwww"...touches the other leg..says "owwww"..touches his arm says "owwww"..House looks at him a second and asks....How about this...Grabs the guys finger and straightens it...he had a broken finger.|`|J3bkEpPDaa	The episode where house electrocutes himself is episode four of season five, "97 Seconds." Every moment is a favorite moment in house for me..I love the recent moment when he showed up at Cuddy's house, kissed her, then walked out. it was very adorable!|`|LgAK1QVMaa	wow that's a good thing to ask and yeah i love the time house meet one of his old college classmates and then the  dude asked house if he ever meet him before and house says "yeah dick right" and the guy says "no!" and then house says "oh the face reminds me of dick"

dpYMlxA4aa	look for what chords are present and where they occur.<br>  if you have a lot of Db and Ab chords then you're probably in Db major. if you have a lot of Bb minor and F chords then you're probably in Bb minor.<br>  if you have cadences on one of these chords that's a definitive sign about which key you're in.<br>  <br>  It will also help to play through it, you can hear the difference between major and minor.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	In addition to what the other two answers said, you can also look for G natural and A nautral.  Most minor music raises the 6th (G) and the 7th (A) during certain situations, but if it's in the major key, you won't commonly see that.|`|kbFty6eVaa	Well oen indicator of the tonic is the dominant (because it precedes and establishes the tonic). The dominant of Db is Ab. The dominant of Bbm is FM. <br>  <br>  An important factor is the leading tone. The leading tone is a half step down from the tonic, in other words the 7th scale degree in major, and the raised 7th scale degree in minor. In Db this is C and in Bbm this is A. <br>  <br>  Take a look at what chords the piece begins [and ends] with. Is the tonic/dominant of Db (Db's, Ab's, not many Bb's) or of Bbm (Bb's, F's, A naturals). The bass line is the most helpful indicator for function.|`|91f9c1a082323a5a5a46fb06dbe20d0daa	you can tell by looking at the triads the notes form. so if the left hand has some form D-F-A Flat, then its D flat major. if it has some form of B flat, D flat, and F, then its b flat minor. also, look at the a. if its canceled out, then its minor.|`|yYAabiSLaa	Look for the raised leading tone ( A natural). If there are a bunch of persisting a naturals, there is a good chance that your piece is in Bb minor. This is the quickest way.

sVPjp3dUaa	John's dad was killed by James Ford (Sawyer). When John was being groomed to lead the Others, Ben told him that he'd have to kill his dad. John couldn't kill him, so Ben left him & his dad at a campsite. Ben told him that he can become leader only after he kills his dad & shows him the body. John ended up tying his dad to a chair in an abandoned ship in the jungle. He then went to find James (Sawyer) to have HIM kill his dad. James refused to kill John's dad, but he went with John anyway & ended up getting locked in the room with John's dad. While John's dad & James are talking, he confesses that he had conned James' mom using the name Tom Sawyer. That's when James realized where he had gotten the nickname 'Sawyer' from & that John's father was also HIS father. Since James & his mom had such a lousy life, he snapped and ended up killing John's father.|`|AA10954273	Tom is partially right.  John Locke and James "Sawyer" Ford are not related.  Locke's father is the con man who conned Sawyer's mom, which led to his father murdering her and then killing himself.  It's also ambiguous whether that was actually Locke's father who was killed - he said he was in a car accident and woke up on the island.  We've seen dead people walking around on the island, so it's possible that what Sawyer killed was some sort of manifestation that simply appeared to be Locke's father.

AA11002791	Mini Biography<br>  <br>  Will Smith was the second of four children of Caroline (school board employee) and Willard C Smith Sr. (owner of a refrigeration company). Smith is of both African American and Native American heritage. He grew up in middle class area in West Philadelphia called Wynnefield. Will attended the Overbrook High School located in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He got the nickname 'Prince' because of the way he could charm his way out of trouble. Bright student Will also signed up with the high-status Julia Reynolds Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School in Philadelphia.<br>  <br>  Pursuing music, he met Jeff Townes at a party and they soon began performing together as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. When the duo took off in popularity, Smith made and spent a lot of money on a house, cars and jewelry; leading to his near bankruptcy in his early twenties.<br>  <br>  Luckily, in 1989, he met Benny Medina, who had an idea for a sitcom based on his life in Beverly Hills. Smith loved the idea as did NBC which put on the "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" (1990). The plot was simple -Will basically played himself; a street-smart West Philly kid transplanted to Beverly Hills. The series lasted 6 years. During that time, he ventured into movies where the critics took note of him in Six Degrees of Separation (1993). With the success that came with the action picture Bad Boys (1995), Will's movie career was set. He had a huge Blockbuster hit with Independence Day (1996) where he plays the alien-battling Marine Corps Captain Steven Hiller.|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...Grannie Smith (of the apple fame) is his grandmother and one of the Smith Brothers (of cough drop fame) is his grandfather...|`|RxNLUCxdaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/C522_TxQh2w&h" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/v/C522_TxQh2w&h</a><br>  <br>  celebrity grandparents video will is one of them

Taylor was walking in the neighborhood and saw her boyfriend walking into a house, which is the girl he was cheating on Taylor with walks out of. Taylor then realizes that what her friend at the restaurant told her was true.|`|04lqPAagaa	Okay I think this is the explanation of "Picture to Burn". It looked like it was the same guy from that video. I think the girl at the restaurant is telling Taylor that her boyfriend is cheating. Maybe he was apologizing for cheating and the girl that came out of the house had to be the other woman.
cIqpL3tGaa	Nice guy, if you are referring to the thing about 3 weeks ago, that was taken out of context, and he has since apologized for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good actor, makes great movies, everyone bursts a bubble once in a while.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	a person like him should know that he's a target and thus should try to refrain from this kind of outburst.  otherwise, take the heat, which it seems he has, and apologized.  however, i believe just because he's the 'star' doesn't give him any right to treat others like sh*t for a mistake.  sure he has to be in character and concentrate to get it right, just like every other person who works for a living.  every time you see out-takes (or almost) it's the actors screwing up, then all the rest of the crew has to do the take again.  what if they started to give him a ration when he makes them do it over?? i have enjoyed his movies tho.<br>  <br>  ps.  how do you take a rant like that out of context? it went on for 5 min.s|`|rqlUvhnpaa	This is for ADVICE not opinions.|`|ERVib5gYaa	I think he's a hot, angry guy.

QWEST CREW DOMINATES|`|tG5PSmwAaa	Quest Crew FTW!!!<br>  <br>  please vote for them :D<br>  <br>  they performed amazingly awesome today. It was an outstanding ovation from judges!|`|kF2TI78kaa	QUEST CREWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!<br>  I think some ppl are voting for beat freaks because it's a girl group.<br>  I think quest brings that WOW factor<br>  <br>  VOTE QUESTT!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT!  -  Hok is also very cute :)|`|RzW3FIbeaa	OMFG Quest Crew just ripped their last two performances on tonight's top 3 finale. <br>  <br>  Fly Khicks got EMBARASSED. Everyone was chanting Quest Crew after their performance and when they were about to announce the winner of the last slot.<br>  <br>  I mean c'mon...one of them was doing a headspin on a piano!<br>  <br>  Beatfreaks are sick too. Best female crew BY FAR. They had the craziest performances especially with the floating ball, but Quest Crew's last performance was just insanity. Their krumping was crazy!<br>  <br>  It's a really close one, but I'm gonna go with Quest Crew.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that Quest Crew already had a fan base with D-Trix and Hok on "So You Think You Can Dance". They made it to the top 10 couples.|`|BJoojnQCaa	That's hard to say right now. I have always liked Quest from day one, but lately Beat  Freaks have been gaining on them. I will wait to after tonight show before I make my final judgment. <br>  <br>  Of course Fly Kicks have got to go tonight. Or I will never watch ABDC again.|`|tjWinaXZaa	LIKE I SAY QUEST IS THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... =D|`|cen8SIssaa	that is really a tough one.....beat freaks and quest crew have always been my fave....and i really hope ur right about FKs b/c they suck super bad!!!!!!!!!!|`|H4VibssIaa	Beat Freakz will win for these reasons 1) First female crew to represent all the styles and possess all the techniques 2) I like Quest Crew also and although their last 2 performances were absolutely SICK, I think Beatbreakz built enough fan base to vote for them to take the title even though they weren't as sick last night, with their consistant amazing performances (the ball & robot routines were the most memorable) 3)  We've seen amazing b-boy stunt crews win it and everyone wants something new and good.    Whomever takes it both are amazing and glad the they were the top two.  Kaba Modern & Fanny Pack should've battled for the tittle the last two seasons, obviously what Jc was talkin about and you already know who the heavy favorite was, this one is a toss up and that's the way it should be.|`|Q6PVv56yaa	QUEST CREW.<br>  <br>  <br>  i mean, DID YOU SEE THEIR LAST TWO PERFORMANCES?  i admit, beat freaks got 'em on some of the other ones but quest crew definetly gave it when it counted the most.  i'm all for female impowerment, but quest crew's tricks and charisma got me.  oh and i hate that most people are gonna vote for beat freaks JUST COZ they're girls.  they're good and everything, but you cannot tell me that they beat out quest crew.  beat freaks were majorly disappointing tonight!|`|3OxRWGXVaa	Ever since the beginning, i've been rooting for quest and beat freaks... And i used to aim a lil more for beat freaks, but 2nite, Quest did SOOO AMAZING!!! I mean, beat freaks are awesome and are the BEST female group so far!!! But i think Quest crew can do more of a variety of dances and can even put out emotion in their dancing thru their "acting"... It's a bit of a toughy, but Im aiming for Quest Crew too =]|`|d43dfcc8365727c0e4deed3f4d41aad8aa	Beat Freaks baby!  I think they've done better these past two performances that Quest Crew.  I'm getting tired of that b-boy mess.|`|jeONpP1yaa	Beat Freaks are going to win because the show is being pegged for only male winnners.|`|jN6OSxnCaa	QUEST CREW ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FarHrhg9aa	beat freaks will WIN! They are the 1st all girl crew to pop, lock, break, and other dance styles as well. quest crew on the other hand have amazing performing skills and their breaking looks alot better than super crew but ill go with beat freaks? and why? because they are the most versatile crew in the whole season that happen to be all females. They rock the stage every week. <br>  Im a guy and im voting for them. They prove that they dont have to expose themselves with slutty looking cloths like fly kicks but rather out perform other crews with real skillz.|`|2p4zUgDnaa	I DEFINITELY want Quest Crew to win!! I love their energy and their creativity. Beat Freaks are an amazing crew too, and I especially wanna give them kudos for being the first girl crew to be incredible without using their body and sexuality to win over the judges (mostly Shane anyways). If Fly Khicks go home tonight (hopefully!!!!), the finale will be finally be a fair fight. Quest Crew FTW!!|`|D1VMdCVNaa	i hope it's quest crew <br>  they rocked tonight's performance. <br>  i didn't think beat freaks were that great tonight<br>  but they were pretty good in the illusion & boys vs. girls episode.<br>  VQTE everybody!!!|`|3c919c56196a4797b15a4e8395fca8c7aa	beat freak's performance wasnt that great tonight.<br>  quest crews definately gonna win !
CQX3TAIoaa	I'm pretty dang sure that it isn't the rasen shuriken. And some of you clearly haven't read the latest chapters of Naruto so stay out of this.<br>  <br>  Now, are you referring to "that jutsu", that Jiraiya said right before Naruto went out on the mission to rescue Garaa? If you are, I have no freaken clue. I want to know so badly though.<br>  <br>  There's also that stuff with the key that Jiraiya had that had to do with the Nine-Tailed Fox. Which could be the same, and it could be different. Someone, I think Jiraiya, said that Minato never did anything without a reason. He was hypothesizing that Minato wanted to allow Naruto to use part of the Nine-Tails' immense chakra. The reasoning being, who in the world would want to put a monster inside of their child.<br>  <br>  Though, I'm kinda fine with not knowing right now, seeing as how the latest chapters have been very interesting :D|`|uKH85DnQaa	The Rasen Shuriken.

But he can't use it. :(|`|oKz6CEjdaa	IS IT JUJITSU? because jujitsu is martial arts... but i dont know what jutsu is|`|n0uMBKtJaa	I assume they were talking about combining the Rasengan with elemental power which Naruto was able to do using multiple shadow clones though it injured him to use it. Now with sage mode he can do it without injury as well as throw it.|`|XmD61yBpaa	No idea mate|`|ptPazvB8aa	they put stuff like that in there so people will keep reading/ watching the show/manga. Thats the kind of thing where it makes you stop and think- "HEY, WHAT JUTSU?"- and then it ends- " WHAT?! OH WELL IM JUST GOING TO HAVE TO READ/SEE THE NEXT EPISODE/ MANGA WHEN IT COMES OUT, *sigh*" see what i mean?|`|PXfUyd5aaa	The Rasen Shuriken. He couldn't use "that jutsu" before because it caused him physical damage. Now that he can throw it, it doesn't have to touch his body and hurting himself isn't a problem anymore.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Which volume?  Can you find an example page?<br>  I'm reading the Japanese version so it may be different; I want to make sure.<br>  I'm too caught up in Sasuke's past in volume 43-44 to think about Naruto right now lol|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	They are talking about the Rasengan.

q4XUy0Duaa	I think forced rhymes are inevitable unless you're willing to do away with a whole bar and lose a dope line.  I think the content is more important than the rhyme though.  I respect lyricists who are more poetic and only use one word that rhymes per line, than one who rhymes three words per line but really isn't saying much.  I think a sequence of events can be a story, but doesn't necessarily have to be.<br>  <br>  This is my favorite story telling track:<br>  J-Live - One For The Griot<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRhSTOFCqDU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRhSTOFCq...</a><br>  It's ill because he switches up the story three times, and all three are well written and told.|`|DOShS8q0aa	The story must be told but your guna have some forced stuff in there. I would site Stan by Eminem cuz it has both but the song is still successful, and one of my favorites by him. I gotta say Scenario by Tribe Called Quest is my favorite rap but i don't know what you'd classify that as|`|L0AoQgj5aa	Truly what's up with a. Battle u scared nikker.

A 10 point score your rhymes r truly a bore. You rap is so wack I did finish reading all of it your lame stop the bull sh it.|`|jvX36ryyaa	forced rhymes dont only ruin songs, they ruin careers.  thats why biggie is the best in my mind, and jigga is number 2, their rhymes sound so natural.  others like htis are az, nas, and lupe.  (these guys are all in my top ten and jump around from 2-10, cuz biggies #1, all the time)<br>  <br>  yeah its defninitely ok as long as you get back on subject or your song is supposed to be going crazy off task<br>  <br>  there is a difference, a story has a message to and and a series of events is a story without the concrete message.  my favorite song that tells a story is dance with the devil by immortal technique. that shyt is deep and it has a message and all.  my favorite sequence is i got a story to tell by biggie.  another favorite that im listening to right now is show me the good life by blu, 1st verse blows my mind everything i hear it<br>  <br>  favorite topic or style of rap is something that is really personall to the artist. they arnt making the song to make a hot song or anything like that (the kind of songs wayne makes), im talking about the kinds of songs where its almost like listening to poetry and you can just feel the emotion from the artist.  some fav songs like this are suicidal thoughts by biggie, no apologies by eminem, its ok by eminem, if i had by eminem, a moment of clarity by jay-z, soo much from nas but cuz i dont wanna just name a thousand songs ill say lifes a b*tch.  i could go on and on but i think i made my point
AA10906922	I wouldn't walk away. Walking away is the easy way out. Part of me would like Cane to be a little mean but having a man playing good on TV is wonderful because finding one in real life is like finding a needle in a haystack. They don't seem to exist. Go Cane kick their butts.|`|r7sgshwKaa	Pretty much. I mean I am like so not with him beating his chest and acting like a neanderthal from hell. Its putting me to sleep. And hitting Billy over this child? Oh yeah he would be a good role model for Cordelia.|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	Move back to Australia and take Sharon with him. Cuz they are both driving me nuts!!!!!!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think Cane is shady and his hiding something..|`|e1s5FQBCaa	I think Cane is getting Annoying he is such a mommas boy|`|wC9XIR43aa	I think for once Cane is finally making people see he is no push over. I really, really want Lily and Cane to become a very happy married couple, but at the same time I could see where Lily would be iffy. I mean, they lost their child, but here is Chloe's child, that Cane is wanting Lily to help him raise. It must be rough having that rubbed in her face all the time, especially now that she knows it wasn't Cane's to begin with. So I can see where Cane wants Cordelia because he became attached to her, but at the same time I can understand Lily not wanting to have it shoved in her face every day. So I don't know what I would do if I was in Lily's position, much less Cane's.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I applaud Cane right now for the way he feels but to be truthful he should run as fast as he can and be happy that he still is the baby's uncle and go and make a life with Lily, he has not had ample time to really bond with the baby since the baby is only what a week old, I also feel the only mistake Billy made was when he returned home he did not mention to any one that he and Chloe once dated, but also she was with his brother and he assumed the baby was Cane's so I can see why he did not mention that, and he asked Chloe several times if the baby was his and she always denied it. It was not until recently that she did tell him by then all he could do was suffer with the truth, like I said I really feel sorry for Cane but that is not his baby and I am glad they did not long wind this story line like Lilly's, Abbey or that Summer is going to be Jack's and in the end the only person they should be mad at is Chloe.so yes I would walk cause in the end he can't win so Walk Cane he did a honorable thing and can be proud of who he is for that. but the hurt he feels he will get over it.and we all can understand. next time bet he won't be drunk.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	As I said earlier, I am glad to see Cane "grow a pair" finally.|`|HK30PzNraa	I am one of the few people on here that applauds Canes character right now.I personally think Cane and Lily should marry and have at least partial custody of Cordelia.Chloe and Billy are immature and deserve each other.I am rooting for Cane.|`|uVwPykXlaa	the fact that he was played before means only one thing.<br>  hes a fool.<br>  move on.....if twas me,i wuld move on and not taking crap from anyone after all this drama.<br>  go back to lily and finally get married and get kids of yo OWN|`|75zggy81aa	I want him to turn evil! Come up with a scheme instead of playing victim to one.|`|4kuWOZowaa	I really hate cane right now.

sVlFl2dbaa	Yes!!|`|nnoMVbLkaa	I would if that's what ,my friend wanted to do. I would not do it without her permission even though she is my friend. That is her choice and not mine, I would support her in whatever she decided to do. With that being said I am not sure if taking him on a talk show would really make him want to step up. He is the only person that can want to be there for his child. Unfortunately there are a lot of men and women out their who choose not to be a part of their children's life. I have watched Maury and Steve Wilkos  and I have seen only a few number of people step up. It is truly sad that someone would want to dis-include themselves from such a wonderful thing, but you know what it is their loss. <br>  <br>  I have a child with a man that wants nothing to do with her and let me tell you it hurts to know that he does not want to be their. I am fortunate enough to have a man that has stepped up and my daughter loves him, that is her dad. I would not have it any other way and that's just my opinion. I know it's hurtful to know he does not want to be their. I wish your friend and her baby the best!|`|o6huBtaGaa	Yes, I would!|`|WyxxDgSeaa	No. I value my privacy and respect others' privacy too. Don't mistake the kind of shows you mentioned as someone wanting to help. They're all about ratings and embarrassment. If you value your friend, stay out of her business.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	No, I would not. Unless, your friend has asked for you for this kind of help...stay out it.
ARGrcebdaa	Daniel P  :  Put a link to your question and people will click and answer it.  (smiling)<br>  <br>  <br>  Both have a level of talent untouched by most musical performers and each in their own way are the best.  I prefer the majority of Michael's music both with and without his less popular siblings.  I remember growing up in Athens, Georgia and singing and dancing to The Jackson 5 and The Temptations.  I listen to a lot of Prince's music but not all of it.  There's nothing Michael has ever done that I won't listen to.<br>  <br>  Michael ... Hands down.|`|cjknXzm9aa	i'm going to say michael jackson. i like because of the variety of music he made but yet he was consistent. when he made billie jean and performed for the first time, people got up and started clapping along with song they'd never heard before. everyone loves that song. i've never been a Prince fan. I only like scandalous by him. only Prince is an icon in his right considering he can play two styles R&B and Rock & Roll equally well. Plz answer my question in this section.|`|A0825FVZaa	Michael Jackson, in his prime, was more popular than Elvis was.Prince was an OK singer but never had the numerous hits that Michael had. Thriller was about the most bought album ever.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	Michael Jackson just because I listened to him way more than prince as a kid. *I wish he hadn't turned into a weirdo*|`|XB4w8SS4aa	Neither do my kind of music but Michael Jackson as strange as he might seem is maybe the most talented musical entertainer ever.Prince is really good but he can't touch Jackson.|`|4BHZxpBUaa	Michael Jackson.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	Micheal Jackson. He could sing, dance, paint, beatbox, moonwalk, watch Disney movies, and produced some good songs. And he wears cool outfits.<br>  <br>  Prince just wears pants with the booty cut out.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Prince is a musical genius who essentially rewrote the book on sound and production back in the 1980s. He is a phenomenal musician and has a discography that has remained at a high quality level for many years. He is to pop music what Miles Davis was to jazz (and they were so close to collaborating together).

ETurhACOaa	I think that is a great idea, she should do whatever it takes to provide for those children cause she was so dead set on having that many, and tax payers shouldn't be responsible for paying for them<br>  <br>  OCTOPUSSY AND THE UNDERWATER TROUSER SNAKE|`|deEWD1k3aa	I'm sure she would! Did you hear she had it all planned out that afterward she would get a tv show like John and Kate plus 8?  She actually thought that it would be an option!!<br>  <br>  Anyways:<br>  Some titles could be...<br>  Eat Me For My Eight<br>  Swallow for the Siblings<br>  Long and Hard, (turkey baster)<br>  <br>  lol that's all i got... :P|`|2zLtIog3aa	NO! that is kind of disturbing. This person is the mother of 8 kids. Can you imagine how humiliating this would be for her kids? I can only imagine the fights in school, also once the kids reach common sense they could judge her for doing so.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	She should, as she will forever be known as the quintessential whore.  There are many folks, probably including her mom, who would consider it her first honest work.<br>  <br>  Title: Eight for Me at Cost to You and Forget the Kids Lives!|`|Qnop8tkjaa	You think that one million dollars is going to support those kids for the rest of their life???<br>  <br>  Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!|`|rEL3BfqCaa	heck no lol<br>  that would be nastayyyy|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	yes everyones mums should|`|KCS862Qaaa	yes. if she has no other way to take care of her kids except food stamps.|`|8HyDZr0Kaa	Octopussy for Eight Men|`|ZRk15H9Caa	No Nanerpuss|`|cxW018C6aa	That's crazy. But having 8 children with no job, no means to support them is MORE crazy.|`|AA10130483	Nope...|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	lls <br>  octopussy<br>  super loose<br>  haha<br>  she better if she wants her kids|`|HLqzrBNmaa	I would love to see some octoc0ck in octopussy (just joking). That women is a ***** and It's embarrassing how you Americans give them money. In Russia the government gives whores no financial support unless they were forced into it.|`|Hr9AfJwYaa	She should. Seeing as how deep she is in debt right now, it would be the wisest things she's done, no matter how disturbing that would be.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Not that I would watch it, but I'd rather see her do that then see my tax money going to her wallet.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	No.

wA8Dyhq7aa	Most of the time, iTunes doesn't.  The record company puts an "explicit lyrics" label on a CD.  The entire album will come up as "explicit" even if there's only one song that "deserves" the warning. <br>  <br>  Case in point:  Jimmy Buffett's "Songs You Know By Heart" comes up with every song being "explicit" even though the "explicit" warning is only for one song ("Why Don't We Get Drunk").

C7umw5Vpaa	I know, right? Adam got a standing ovation from Paula but I didn't notice anything brill. Danny Gokey, because I'm already familiarized and he's obviously good. Danny and Adam both have same style of voice.|`|smCe2RnWaa	i would have to say danny. his version of hero last week was really amazing! its a really close tie though cause i thought that adam's performance last night was one of the best last night! him and danny are def two of the best males right now in the competition!|`|472fd8c2d5c8d3685860a41f0f7b00c3aa	Adam- Danny is cute and good, but so... boring?

Adam Lambert doesn't even belong on the same stage.  Everything I've heard from him so far sounds like musical theater.  He should stick to show tunes and leave the recording to the real talent.|`|EJMlzArraa	DANNY|`|mxUMTsybaa	They are both amazing but I like Adam better he's my favorite.

(Core and Purple)<br>  <br>  The other 3 CD's are all okay but just don't compare to the first 2.  Though the 3rd CD (Tiny Music...) is very very good and I would highly recommend it almost as equally as the first 2.<br>  <br>  I would also highly recommend the STP unplugged...I'm not sure if there is an actual album but you can download most of the songs on the Internet.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	BQ - Ride The Lightining.|`|I17Ui7Tiaa	Purple is a good album.|`|O02cXOTTaa	Core is good<br>  <br>  BQ- Kill 'em all|`|snWybep8aa	I ? Music|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Core and Purple are my favorites and the best in my opinion|`|9RTuRPviaa	I think that Core is my favorite and it seriously is a really good album, i'd probably start with that one.<br>  <br>  bq: Ride the Lightning or ...And Justice For All|`|dyV9MPhDaa	Get their best of album "Thank You", it is awesome.<br>  <br>  BQ: Anything from the 80's. Master of Puppets, Kill 'Em All or Ride The Lightning there are no bad songs on any of the 3.|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	sorry, aint a STP fan, so id be lying if i said one<br>  <br>  ride the lightning|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Core is the best.<br>  <br>  Kill 'Em All|`|7sqjaYx6aa	core or purple. both awesome albums.they're my two favourite STP albums.

NQ37mnWkaa	Personally, I went in chronological order, *but* I didn't get the first two {sorry Perry!} ~ the style of music on those is rather different, and not to my liking. {I only discovered them in 1997, and was choosing from the HMV catelogue, so choice was more limited!}<br>  <br>  So :~<br>  Bloody Kisses [1993]<br>  October Rust [1996] {my personal favourite, especially for 'Wolf Moon'}<br>  World Coming Down [1999]<br>  <br>  "Life Is Killing Me" has a few good tracks, and "Dead Again" is about on a par with "World Coming Down".<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid the two "Best Of" / "Least Worst Of" albums, as they contain edited versions. But, "LWO" does have a couple of great non-album songs, especially '12 Black Rainbows'. <br>  <br>  <br>  You're giving me cravings ~ I know what I'll be listening to in bed tonight!|`|AA10047060	honestly i've heard the songs from the early cd's i don't like them,but OCTOBER RUST...talk about jaw dropping i like that cd too bad i don't own it|`|ef4fdcd84e60e1dac24728288eab23faaa	I actually agree with Andy above me, start with October Rust, that album is a gothic masterpiece,then Bloody Kisses, theres a song on October Rust thats called 'Haunted', my god, wait until you hear how deep Pete Steeles voice goes on it lol, seriously, its a beautiful song, chilling at times and I always used to listen to it when I was working the night shift,helped me to sleep,and I quote from it 'I hate the morning', and do you know what? I DO hate the mornings!<br>  Wolf Moon is my next fave off it. Trust me, choose October Rust, it got album of the month in Terrorizer when it was released in 1996.<br>  <br>  Haunted<br>    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G8uXofE86o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G8uXofE8...</a>|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	October Rust!!!!

IatEdBpvaa	I'm a Dino Jr fan.  A big Dino Jr fan.  But let's face it, after Lou left the band they just became the J Mascis show.  Yeah, live Murph still drummed and Mike Johnson would tour when he was not working on his solo stuff (and later with Mark Lanegan) but J still put the albums together.  They were good, I still really enjoy Green Mind and Where've You Been is one of my favorites by them but it was time to drop the moniker.  When his work with The Fog (and who exactly were they?) came out, I was impressed.  Then again there's not much of J's work that I do not enjoy.  Back Before You Go has the same style of signiature licks that he had been putting out for quite a while beforehand.  But there's not many out there who can play better than him IMO.  Great choice.|`|2i6TPlauaa	Could this possibly destroy Mr. Greenwood?

I don't know... last I left him he was babbling about soap.. have you any idea what he was talking about?<br>  <br>  anyways your song brought a smile to my face, and from what you've witnessed you can tell I've kinda had a rough day... thanks a lot...<br>  <br>  and about your splitting of the atom,.I mean archive....

bvwYVGJOaa	Scorpio guys as far as i know like girls like with assets and fcking beautiful while snubbing the real girls. But they get deeper with someone they are unique or friends, Let him take his time to love you more when you don't call him, they get pissed off often to get least attention, keep yourself busy. Find out what you really want as well as him. he doesn't know what you want. give it about 2/3 wks and come together and talk this through. If he loves you, he'll accept you for who you are and how you are and take on a relationship, if not then it's your choice to stay friends or depart your ways.<br>  <br>  I'm sure this has got nothing to do with you weight, but as a overweighted person myself, you know do something about it ok? I felt the same when my Taurus guy friend who wanted to have sex with me instead of having me as a friend or girlfriend and stilll is confused but hopefully i'll clear away from him as i purely dont know wht he wants from me. But hell i still get attention despite of my weight..it's all about confidence within your own skin|`|C27AHHoiaa	Omg i think all scorpio say that. thats what my crush said too. he lead me on then dont talk to me.. then i told him i would make the 1st move n then he said the same thing. but he calls ... said he like n such. idk!|`|d934139aaff63f1b0ccc2fc31ae2e15faa	He needs his space. Scorpios need space to miss someone. Don't talk to him for a while, act cold and he'll come back running to ya! ;-)|`|I0waERKqaa	Men say a lot of things and in almost every relationship i have ever been in they ALWAYS send you mixed messages, like I love you ,(one minute) i can't stand you, (the next)etc. <br>  <br>  He DOES miss you, however.<br>  <br>  <br>   I guess he had to take a break, and get some air for a little bit.<br>   Don't text him or go back right away, MAKE HIM SUFFER!!! See "the rules", great book. Be a "Rules girl". Even if you are overweight, you can still be a rules girl. Don't make it easy. Overweight women get married all the time, by the way. <br>  He obviously does'nt want to lose you and y'all got history (which is awesome!!) it won't be quite so easy to let you go. <br>  <br>  Show him you need some time to think and be away also.<br>  Don't get too heavy with him, (your getting too emotional, and it's scaring him off) Relax, go back to being friends for awhile. (than get him drunk be lovers, no just kidding)<br>  <br>  Give him some room to breath, now<br>  SCORPIOS:<br>  <br>  This is tough. They can be cruel, but it all comes from an emotional place. scorpios are mean but very intuitive and deep, secretive and complex.<br>  He may have a problem with your weight, (I know a scorpio, aquarius couple that have this issue, the scorpio always makes hurtful comments about the weight, and is trying to get her to go to the gym, etc) but it does not mean he doesn't Love you. Maybe he needs you. Either way, he's there for you, but take it easy. A week or two from now,or maybe a day after tomorrow,  text him back, "I miss you 2", and than, that's it!!<br>  <br>  Ignore him for awhile, take your time when you respond back to him, don't react or respond right away, men and scorpios Love challenges. make him see what it's like to not have you there in your life, and get him to miss you.<br>  <br>  Make him fantasize. <br>  You may be near Aquarius, and Scorpio and Aquarius get along very well together.|`|oRzsljwjaa	Scorpios are difficult to understand i know cuz i ben wit my bf for 3yrs n hes scorpio i still cant figure him out. u should read about ur compabilty with scorpio. that helped me understand a lil bit.|`|e4cZQ367aa	he is second guessing himself.its nothing to do with you,they are just strange confused createres! by that i mean men! i used to date a scorpio.do not over think it and try to figure him out-if he makes you feel bad-even for a second,get out! you dont deserve to be treated that way or messed about because he cant figure out what he wants!<br>  <br>  overweight doesnt mean you're not attractive!|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I would not waste time with him.  He's playing with your feelings and that is the opposite of love and respect. Find someone else.|`|AA10197672	I dont agree with the girly 2 above ^^ you act cold to a Scorpio he wont come back to you. Scorpios should be loves, cared and shown effection to. I am not sure how old the two of you are but seems to be young and he just does not knwo waht he wants. Just see what he says and what he wants from you and go with that. You can not push or force him in to a relationship that he does not want, if you do that you will push him forever! Just play with that he says for a while and see what happenes.....

NO! Hope this helps

Our set when I was growing up was called India on the box & had a beautiful picture of the Taj Mahal in the middle of the board, but it was the same game as Parcheesi.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of a 3-way tie with Backgammon & Monopoly though.  They all have kind of a timeless quality to them.  <br>  <br>  Touring & Flinch were great, too.  They weren't board games, but they came with special sets of cards.  Touring was wild because it was about car trips.  Each player had to collect the required mileage cards, but at the same time,  each player could slap a penalty card on the other player, such as a card for a slower mph or a flat tire or some other dreadful event with a remedy-type card for each, which could be drawn from the deck. There were also Country & City Limits cards, each with its own speed limits.  I don't know if they still sell it.  Flinch seemed more like an intellectual game, but I can't remember much about it....making melds, I suppose.<br>  <br>  We all played a lot of board games & card games when I was a kid, except my older brother, who had a tendency to throw the cards when he was losing.  He liked 52-card Pick-up, or watching me do it.  Gee, & he was supposedly such a popular, outgoing kid.  He was just too competitive for cards & board games & couldn't stand for his little sister to win at anything.

Ow3O7h4caa	The house Moon passes  throughis most important in one's chart.Itgivessomedegree of prominence and importance to affairs governed by the house, and the result will be fortunate or the reverse according to the conditions of that house in the natal chart. If the ephemeris shows that the Moon recevies bad aspect such as opposition of Saturn, the tendency to misfortune will be increased and vice - versa if it receives good aspect from Jupiter.<br>  <br>  This all depends if a house if fortunate or unfortunate at birth and the Moon's transit through it will mark a period tht is good or bad depending.<br>  Note that the Moon is not the only factor that has to be taken into account yet, its unfluence is very inportant.<br>  <br>  In Aries and for people who have a strong Aries Moon, all matters to do with the mental sphere will be prominent during this time. It makes one more assertive and also impulsive, desiring to be at the very head of things, wanting to rule and lead depending of the house this takes place in.<br>  Having said this, Moon will make you more irritable that you usually are and more active and ambitious. You will find yourself prone to make changes, alter existing conditions etc... Your personality will be stronger at this time, and the life force more abundant than usual. Thus, avoid rashness and think twice before acting.|`|VAVJlSykaa	im sad|`|2hNLnSkAaa	Well I'm an Aries Mars + VII in Aries, don't know if there's a connection here -__- anyway, I find myself to be more open and impulsive than usual..!

hk4v0G6faa	She is wrong a lot.  I think Margo is a great character but the writers make her look like a total idiot some times.  It drives me crazy.  Margo is supposed to be this great smart cop, but they never make her look like one.  Her character gets the blunt of bad story telling.  Just to keep a story line going they make her over look so many things- that is until her own son does something and then she doesn't miss a beat and is forced to arrest him.  <br>     I say keep Margo around- she deserves it, but for the love of God the show needs to stop making her look like a total as*.|`|yNfZO1I8aa	Personally, I find Margo to be very good at her job. She has had to put her own son behind bars numerous times, something that no one is prepared for, and has solved numerous crimes. I don't believe she does a bad job at the PD; even though she is wrong a lot, many police officers are. The whole game doesn't depend on a gut-feeling: it depends on evidence. So, I don't believe she should be demoted. Plus, the PD would be nothing without her.|`|e1s5FQBCaa	She should be demoted and Jack should get her job.

Llo3XzGFaa	there are horoscopes that are unisex, not any just for men that I know of. But I do remember reading horoscopes in my hometown paper that had everything unisex.

kXxaUnSUaa	Hey, I just watched a clip of this online - the music playing during the first ballroom dance is an instrumental version of 'Moon River' by Andy Williams. It's not on the Take The Lead soundtrack CD though, but it's a classic song so I'm sure you'll find a version of it somewhere.

AA10887916	As soon as I saw this question I knew there'd be a list of slightly dull answers all choosing Hendrix.  The only valid answer is that neither one could do what the other does - they are totally different guitarists in terms of technique and function int he music they produce.  they simply cannot be compared to each other.|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	It is not much of a debate that Jimi is the more talented of the two, but some would argue about whether Jimi is the most talented of all time.|`|eR7BjZvIaa	Hendrix|`|ZJH2tun5aa	even though U2 is in my top 5 or even 3 all time fave bands and I think Edge is often under rated and gets a unique sound.

When I was younger he was playing at a venue in Brighton and I couldn't go. Some of the older kids did and said he started by making the guitar talk.

A genius.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	Andres Segovia.|`|rgovWVP4aa	jimi hendrix because not only did he play the guitar but who ever saw him were blown away and we will stillbe listening to his stuff for ever plus in those days the music was p-layed different as today alot of stuff is mixed to sound good|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Jimi Hendrix set the standards that only a handful of guitarists have come close to equalling, and the Edge is not among them|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ Jimi Hendrix no doubt...the man was left handed but he always used a right handed giutar just played it upside down....<^><..|`|AA12353869	Hendrix by a million miles.

zTfMdChTaa	yea. it's true that beyonce knows to dance well. But barbadians can dance better. Rihanna doesn't dance9have no idea why) but she can dance extremely well, and i know that. I think she doesn't dance because it'll take more time for the song & video to get to the public because of the practicing. <br>  <br>  Beyonce thinks she's the best, and is sort of over-confident and like a b**ch. <br>  <br>  Rihanna is younger, which more people are into now.<br>  Her songs have lots of meaning  example.

A dislike does not involve irrational avoidance and fear.  There is a reason for a dislike even though someone may not always remember why.  I know someone who hates the taste of watermelon because he has an allergy to it that causes his throat to swell shut when he eats it-but he's not afraid of it.  I know someone else who doesn't like cats because he's allergic to them and they make his nose run and his eyes itch and water but he's not afraid of them.|`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	Yeah, dislike.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Depending on the subject, you could be:<br>  <br>  Hateful<br>  A bigot<br>  Prejudiced<br>  Biased<br>  <br>  It could be also referred to as; Dislike or Aversion.|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	Um.. an aversion.<br>  You have an aversion to cats.|`|AA10458195	Having a phoebia is intense.

If she sees some of them swarming around me, esp. the ones she's friends with, she always gives me the evil eye. Or when I'm wearing a nice outfit, she has this habit of looking at me up and down in a mean way! She does this to all women in the job, not just me. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say they are envious. More like possessive.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	They can be for any reasons for something others have that he/she don't! <br>  <br>  A cancer ex classmate of mine was jealous the fact i had a better grade than him and his face?! you should have been there!<br>  <br>  My sister is a Cancer and despite the fact she got a odd job she gets envious of me how i'm better and says it any a odd way.|`|AA10197672	I can say that you just described any girl these days.

But then again, I am that way too, and I am sure a lot of other signs out there...|`|15d1Ig0Haa	That could be said for ALL women not just Cancers.|`|AA11946996	My wife is a Cancer and I would say no.

tIdMifCzaa	omg! i know the perfect one, i had to do a project on making a comercial in 8th grade and one of the songs i used for it was Getting Better by the beatles its REALLY upbeat sounds comercially, and works for a lot of things, especially the beginning of the song. :]]<br>  <br>  <br>  some other happy and cheery songs could be: Octopus's Garden, Ticket to Ride, Hello Goodbye, Good Day Sunshine!!! Thats actually now that i think about it, that is actually the song that i used, So that is a really good one to use too, and this is the one that has the good intro..... haha sorry. anyways, Got to get you into my life, When im 64 is a good one, happiness is a warm gun, <br>  <br>  <br>  but my main suggestions are Good Day Sunshine, and Getting Better :]] when i did my project used good day sunshine and i ended up getting the best grade in the class :]  so i hope i helped!|`|tc1oaf6taa	Sg.

yQl4fiJAaa	homer, because all peter does is be perverted all the time. its not even funny<br>  <br>  HOMER CAME FIRST!!!|`|KnjfbWdjaa	Peter Griffin.<br>  <br>  Because he is mentally retarded. That is what makes the show so funny.... HIS DECISIONS.|`|0vX8AJ0Kaa	oo tht tough but i'll go with homer cuz even tho hes bit of an idiot but he loves his family n rly funny!!|`|23DiWU58aa	look at my name. what do you think?!|`|hTgnvLOSaa	Homer<br>  <br>  Homer is lazy, impulsive, dumb, and somewhat negligent. However, he always tries to make his family happy and provide for them. He always stands up for what he believes in and he'll put in a lot of effort for something if it's something that's fun.<br>  <br>  Peter's behavior is odd and inconsistent. He's presented almost psychopathic or even autistic. He's self-centered to the point of narcissism and he's sometimes outright racist. He's more of a burdon on his own family than anything else. He doesn't seem to recognize that other people have feelings and he laughs impulsively and immature points of humor.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	Peter Griffin cause he's the biggest animated jerk in the new millenium so far.

For the Russian author, see Nikolai Gogol.<br>  <br>  A googol is the large number 10100, that is, the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeros (in decimal representation). The term was coined in 1938[1] by Milton Sirotta (1929–1980), nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner. Kasner popularized the concept in his book Mathematics and the Imagination (1940).<br>  <br>  Googol is of the same order of magnitude as the factorial of 70 (70! being approximately 1.198 googol, or 10 to the power 100.0784), and its only prime factors are 2 and 5 (100 of each). In binary it would take up 333 bits. A googol has no particular significance in mathematics, but is useful when comparing with other incredibly large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles in the visible universe or the number of possible chess games. Edward Kasner created it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity, and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics.<br>  <br>  A googol can be written in conventional notation as follows:<br>  <br>      1 googol<br>      = 10100<br>      = 10,?000,000,000,?000,000,000,?000,000,00... 000,000,000,?000,000,000,?000,000,000,?0... 000,000,000,?000,000,000<br>  <br>  Its official English number name is ten duotrigintillion on the short scale, ten thousand sexdecillion on the long scale, or ten sexdecilliard on the Peletier long scale.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Googolplex<br>      * 2 Googol and comparable large numbers<br>      * 3 In popular culture<br>      * 4 See also<br>      * 5 References<br>      * 6 External links<br>  <br>  [edit] Googolplex<br>  <br>      Main article: googolplex<br>  <br>  A googolplex is the number one followed by one googol zeroes, or ten raised to the power of one googol:<br>  <br>      10googol = 10(10100).<br>  <br>  In the documentary Cosmos, physicist and broadcas|`|f26Vbwo9aa	1 why|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	7|`|LfXJOk0baa	5|`|8LiiDNQIaa	mmmm let me think <br>  8|`|ugb4LsHWaa	Aprox. 2164284981036537180476271480365278031624... is an under-exaggeration|`|l6PeuLOOaa	like 5 :)|`|Mqhbooqzaa	5|`|vZ6bEf2Jaa	7 !!! :D then again i like being comfortable :)|`|9Wn9cE8Paa	I start off with 4--- they typically relocate sometime during the night<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkRZtgzpfFP1z1sts23jQkbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226143319AAlhaIY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA10571910	1 :)|`|Z4wmiI37aa	3|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	4|`|a3bQQDrFaa	*        <br>  <br>  4|`|W4qguA2saa	lmao.<br>  i have like 10.<br>  its so cumfy.

They enjoy simple pleasures, like wine, cheese, and fruit together for a snack.  One of my favorite music composers is Claude Debussey who wrote in very complex key signatures.

fc1n9vBjaa	I think they seem happy and family orientated. I'd like to be a country person, even though it carries around a stigma for being backwards or out of touch, but stereotypes are stupid.|`|0PFQipk4aa	I'm from TN, so I would have to say that there's a huge difference between "country" and "redneck", as i'm sure you already know (from your avatar name). Love country people, they are dependable, hardworking, trustworthy. Rednecks, on the other hand, get on my LAST NERVE. They are for the most part opinionated, arrogant, and stubborn.|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	They treat you so friendly you feel like you ARE family.

NQ3XZElFaa	They're pop rock.<br>  <br>  Rock music is not synonymous with good music, nor with heavy music, nor rebellious music.<br>  <br>  Erie: There is a lot of great rock music, but rock music does not mean good music.

16d2c815eb66a6fa1a02c49f202e6347aa	Ha! I will never get that scene out of my memory,,,,,,,visual image permanently implanted!  Yeh, I think that was too weird even for Christian,,,,,which is saying a lot!  I think it would be neat to have another doctor for the sicko sex scenes, and give Julian McMahon a break,, don't you think that as an actor, he has got to be tired of that role? I think Christian's illness, and marriage to Liz,,will give us a chance to see the more human side of him,,,,,,,I do hope that he comes up with a "miracle" cure,,,it wouldn't be the same without him,,,,|`|OdqlFHhfaa	The new doc is gone, and I'll never look at nice furniture the same.<br>  <br>  If you missed it it can be watched at <a href="http://www.watchniptuck.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchniptuck.ca</a> if you seen it already maybe you wouldn't want to see it again, kinda strange episode.|`|1YFot6MKaa	hahaha that sofa scene was funny, & that guy is gone. but he came back to **** the surgical table. lol|`|lDcCn69haa	lol that was funny!|`|AA12081834	Um...he's not the new doctor, anymore..I think humping Christian's sofa weirded them out..and did you catch the end when he was with the operating table?|`|HFMx5LmGaa	Because Christian's getting married to Liz, they need another guy to help Sean with the practice. So they were going to hire this guy until they walked in on him and the couch. He has this thing were he believes that you can have sex with inanimate objects so he faces the couch to be like a woman's you know and starts to have sex with it.
yCfu6mc0aa	I agree, Hosea definitely didn't deserve it. I was so mad when they announced him the winner! Stefan should've won it, he'd been consistently good the entire season, unlike Hosea.<br>  <br>  and for my top 3:<br>  Fabio, Stefan, and Jeff|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	No, I don't think Hosea deserved it.  <br>  Stephan was a better chef, if a rather unpleasant individual.  I was really hoping Carla would win.  She never should have listened to Casey.  I guess she just didn't have enough confidence in herself.  <br>  For the final, I wanted Carla, Fabio and Stephan, with Carla as the winner.

DDw6k8JOaa	Because hes a friggin' Taurus.|`|AA10197672	Depends on what your sign is, you two might not be compatible. If you like him back, tell him to take it slow and get to know one another first and then see what wil happen. He sounds like a young Taurus thats scared of a relationship and commitments. Make him feel comfortable and in ease, dont put lot of pressure on him either....|`|bvwYVGJOaa	He might have been hurt so badly in the past to give you hot and cold attitude on you and possibly to hurt you too by maybe having sex with him or do something you both would regret later in life. Ok, you have to get him to sit down and talk to him from the top to middle to the end. <br>  <br>  Ask him what does he want, in life, family, friends and you..Taurus is a earth sign and wants stability and security in everything emotions, mentally and physically. He's insecure that's all. As you're an Aries and likely to be more direct and outspoken, you have to be a little sensitive towards his hurts and let him heal his pain. Just be a support to him!|`|CpotQhwkaa	my fiancee is a taurus. as many people will tell you that horoscopes arent real, but it is something i have actually noticed to be true about many people. taurus are just very independent and stubborn. they don't show emotion. they save all their expression of love for... the bedroom. he probably wont be very good at telling you how he feels about your relationship. he'll probably treat you differently than other boyfriends would, but even if you feel like hes treating you as a friend, he could be completely head over heels for you and you would never know.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mysticalblaze.com/AstrologyTaurus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysticalblaze.com/AstrologyTa...</a><br>  check this out. you might be able to get some more specific answers.|`|d934139aaff63f1b0ccc2fc31ae2e15faa	Taurus is very stubborn.

They are hard to figure out and I think it has nothing to do with his sign, but just him in general.|`|lg7FDex4aa	my bf is a taurus and he's almost perfect. Maybe he's been hurt before?

SmFcDx4waa	hmmmm.....well commercial wise i think it works pretty good...the timing and imagery is good. however...I feel like there needs to be some examples of HOW teens are discriminated against, because personally I can't think of any examples...laws, and rules that are put in place that keep teens from drinking,working, driving, making their own finacial decisions etc. are put there for good reason...(I know I'm gonna sound like a parent here but trust me when I say that stuff that does not seem fair right now will totally make sense once you're older) So the downfall of the commercial is that it is trying to stop something that I think a LOT of people would argue does not exist... (it would be like making a commercial to stop the abuse of beaches, and showing a bunch kids with sandpails crying...but not explaining HOW beaches are being abused) Anyway...thats my opinion It is well made but is calling out a problem that I don't believe exists. So in order to get me on your side - FIRST you have to convince me it really is a problem|`|crZg76Hpaa	Lmao that kicks *** for being 13.<br>  <br>  And i had never even heard of ageism and I go to Uni.

Ow3O7h4caa	A Cancer Sun type are cautious and reserved and rarely show their whole nature on the surface. Home life and domestic issues are important and they are very sensitive when it comes to family. These people love memories of the past, antiquities, and inclined to be romantic, They are economical and quite persistence and tend to cling and never let go , once they hold on to something. <br>  <br>  The Moon/Libra type  hate to be restricted and usually have many friends and acquaintances.  The emotional side is quite active actually but too easy-going and indifferent at times. This type loves ease and pleasure, arts and social gatherings. They have good powers of imitation and perception, and love of comparison. The Moon/Libra type needs to be even-tempered, and try to keep a balance and shouldn't carry comparisons too far.<br>  <br>  As far as compatibility, others factors need to be taken into account. Cancer loves to hold on to people but a Libran Moon needs space to move. This could hurt the Cancer person because a Libran Moon can be indifferent to others and his partner. These two are better as friends unless other aspects can offset the detach nature of Moon/Libra or the clingness of Cancer.

1lh7oQsPaa	I used to think it helped because it made me feel more comfortable on stage.  <br>  <br>  However, when I started recording, I noticed that even a beer or two impairs my judgment just enough to slightly throw off my pitch & timing.   I FEEL like I sing better, but the recordings tell me otherwise.  Also, alcohol dehydrates you, which is bad for the chords.  It tends to make them more easily irritated. <br>  <br>  To loosen up my chords, I do this exercise where I take three deep breaths from the diaphragm, then hold the third & slowly release it while making a very quiet "sshhhhh" sound, sort of like a snake hissing.  Keep it going for as long as you can.  You should be able to do it for at least 30 seconds.   After a couple of these, I do the same thing with a note, near the middle of my range & just try to hold it as even as I can, at low volume, for as long as I can.   I'm ready to go after that.<br>  <br>  I sip watered down (no sugar added) pineapple juice on stage because it soothes my chords & keeps them clean.|`|gVVZQ4ikaa	Just 2 (little) vodka will make you feel well. And right within the concert you might have some glasses of mild warm peppermint tea (if you like it sweet, with LOTS of sugar!!!)

BQ4P30OZaa	No, they just want a girl who likes them for who they are, not how much money and fame they have. =b|`|D2WLPK0gaa	I don't know about your question but I needed to tell you:<br>  Can you please not copy my answers and answer them in different questions?<br>  Thanks..|`|ulBW2m62aa	No.<br>  They just don't like conceited girls who needs someone to do everything for her.<br>  So it won't matter as long as your not a begger and you're sweet and have their mom's apporval.|`|KGj1dxhQaa	that song is supposed to be about kevin's ex girlfriend, if i remember right. kinda a payback song. i know before they were super duper disney famous, joe dated the family friend's daughter (hence the song "mandy") and she's just a normal girl. kevin's current girlfriend isn't a celebrity, but she is pretty. and miley cyrus isn't quiet, yet she and nick have openly talked about dating. same with selena gomez. so i think they're caught up in hollywood, which does have a lot of pretty people, and they're hot, famous, and there's three of them. so i don't think they have standards. it's just how things go.|`|dejqLjaLaa	The Jonas Brothers don't have types, because then they will be missing out on amazing girls out there. Plus, the song doesn't mean they hate girls that are snot up and snooty. The song was about Kevin's ex girlfriend, Zoe. She only dated him because she wanted to be famous.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	no. and in the song their talking about annoying spoiled girls. and maybe cause she's nice and respects him. and learn something about them genius.|`|AwVy8T0Caa	No and the whole hair color thing is just a coincidence!<br>  <br>  They aren't like that, they dont neccesarily have standards!

The Jonas brothers are the nicest celebrities ever! They just dont want snobby girlfriends which is understandable!|`|MsRKofZoaa	thye'ed pretty much like any kind of girl  Nick went out with Miley, she WAY not quite.

How many people do you 'feel' you 'need' to be in touch with?  100's?  1000's?  Millions?  Come on, really.  I've deleted a couple myspace accounts because I too became obsessed with being on the account pretty much all night long... I never felt sad about deleting them, nor regretful.  Gone... good.  Also, on one account I had over 5K friends... who cares?  97% of them I didn't even know.  Facebook?  Much the same...|`|AA10783888	I felt relieved.

QZtRVdRtaa	Wow, t his is the crappiest sceince project ever, because it has nothing to do with science.<br>  <br>  Mutants are organisms or new genetic characters arising from or resulting from an instance of mutation. And mutation is a change to the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of an organism that changes DNA and involves the creation of a new characteristic or trait not found in the original organism. This is a fancy way of saying a mutant is an organism that goes through some change in their DNA and is therefore different that the original organism. Many different factors can lead to mutations, and every living thing can be a mutant<br>  <br>  You make it sound like Mutants = Zombies. 'Mutant' is a broad term, so in essence they do exist, but not in any way/shape/form as 'attacking' you so you need to get clean water from a purification system or putting anything around the building. Mutants include viruses, bacteria, plants, animals, humans, fish, bugs, birds and so on, so it sounds like your confusing mutants with zombies or monsters. Or maybe the X Men, who are mutants because a gene in their DNA is different which gives them superpowers, an extreme case of mutation. (Usually a mutation isn't noticable or may have a small effect, and no mutation so far has given anyone super powers. So a mutant may have say an extra thumb or an exta bone in its wing or a different color on its shell. Most, if not all mutations don't effect the mental state of an organism so mutants wouldn't attack you at all, ever)|`|4qVWj3UHaa	maybe(idk)they cant have holywater sprayed on them.|`|5EtiRi2yaa	wow no clue.

"Just hold on for a bit longer, I've got to focus a little," said the photographer. <br>  <br>  Yet again, "WHAT DID HE SAY?"<br>  <br>  "HE SAYS HE'S GONNA FOCUS!"<br>  <br>  With a big grin the deaf twin shouted out, "OH MY - BOTH OF US?"|`|DTPERfnBaa	The sky was dark<br>  The moon was high<br>  <br>  All alone just she and i<br>  <br>  Her hair was soft<br>  Her eyes were blue<br>  <br>  I knew just what<br>  She wanted to do<br>  <br>  Her skin so soft<br>  Her legs so fine<br>  <br>  I ran my fingers<br>  Down her spine<br>  <br>  I didn't know how<br>  But I tried my best<br>  <br>  I started by placing<br>  My hands on her breast<br>  <br>  I remember my fear<br>  My fast beating heart<br>  <br>  But slowly she spread<br>  Her legs apart<br>  <br>  And when I did it<br>  I felt no shame<br>  <br>  All at once<br>  The white stuff came<br>  <br>  At last it's finished<br>  It's all over now<br>  <br>  My first time ever<br>  <br>  At milking a "COW"|`|pwlgAnb3aa	a blonde is listening to the radio when she hears, "two Brazilians just died in a car crash"<br>  and she says OMG!

12z40bZ3aa	I loved it. I feel like Josh spent the last two years writing an album just for me. It's different from the last one, but I think a carbon copy of what's been done would have been a waste of time. I think the boys knew that too, that's why they didn't put out a new album six months after the last one.<br>  <br>  You can really tell that Marianas Trench has spent the last two years working hard on every note and every lyric. I don't know how anyone can call all that hard work selling out. After hearing 'Beside You' if you didn't fall in love with these guys again you obviously weren't much of a fan in the first place.<br>  <br>  It was great to hear Josh working his voice in different ways than what the style of 'Fix Me' allowed him to in songs like 'Good to You' and 'Lover Dearest'.<br>  <br>  Probably the most ambitious part of this Album is the Masterpiece I, II, and III. It's a bit surprising that a label would let a band do something like that on their sophomore album - but once you listen through the album a few times it becomes obvious why they did that. It ties everything together, like a tribute to the band's career so far.<br>  <br>  Masterpiece III is beautifully done. I read that it took them 3 weeks to get it perfect and every note and word of that song is a testament to that. Excellent work. Once they go on Tour I'm going to the show no matter what.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i think they sold out. they're just another fall out boy kind of band now. i'll stick with the first album|`|Fk54Y16qaa	I met Marianas Trench two years ago. They were such nice layed back guys.<br>  I was disappointed at the new single, Cross My Heart and Hope to Die, it really sounds like the new album will be a sell out.<br>  If I ever do listen to it, I'll be cringing.<br>  <br>  First album was great tho.

The whole King of New York thing translated into greatest so......<br>  <br>  I think the weight had something to do with it, to be able to sustain concerts and all - also junior mafia was better than outlaws.<br>  <br>  My eyes, big was better than pac, greatest? perhaps lyrically|`|w4MvA4Rgaa	Because he is the King of New York and since New York is where Hip-Hop Started and where the best emcee's are at.<br>  <br>  I can understand you not thinking he's #1 Personally I think he was the Greatest and I got a few facts to support my opinon But it varies how you look at Hip-Hop.<br>  <br>  But 2pac Biggie and Eazy-E do bother me in 1 way they get WAYYY too much regonition idc how good each one I mean the other dead emcee's deserve more respect.<br>  <br>  I mean ask the Average Hip-Hop Fan the Day Big L Died.<br>  <br>  Then Ask em what day 2pac Died.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Wow, I could write an essay on why Biggie shouldn't be considered the greatest rapper ever, but trying to argue this on the basis that he wasn't popular enough or didn't make enough hits is probably the most retarded thing you could have said.<br>  <br>  He was one of, if not THE most popular rapper in the world during his short career. I don't believe that necessarily means greatness, but you're completely wrong with your information.|`|v7hTlEkCaa	Album sales are irrelevant to a rappers skill. Biggie was really that good of a rapper, and lyrically, he was better than 2Pac. 2Pac probably sold more albums because he was easier to understand than Biggie, and he showed more emotion in his songs.

RKLFYS2Naa	Well this is a great topic--<br>  <br>  You see, I have had a huge crush on that biggie poppa guy for years. And when the news broke that he was all shot up and died, I was devastated.  I understand how it is to be completed  infatuated w/ a singer/celebrity. Once, I even sat outside his home for 21 hours, until FINALLY he came outside, and didn't even wave to me. :( infact, he didn't even wanna give me his autograph! : (<br>  <br>  I think that juaquin (however you spell his friggin 1st name) is going threw menopause. He deeply believes that he is a black person I suppose.  He wants to BE just like my dearest, beloved idol, Big Poppa!! I believe that once Juaquin unites w/ his gang and begins his new career in  rapping, he will then be all shot up and join the Notorious B.I.G. in heaven! And- then they can rap happily ever after together.<br>  <br>  Let's face it...sometimes wiggers wanna be like blackies...it's okay...just move on like I did to another singer/celebrity of choice--Such as Will Smith, Tom Cruise, or maybe go lesbo and choose Jennifer Aniston!!<br>  <br>  But, Whoever you choose to obsess w/ next, make sure you sit in front of their home and stock them 24/7, they are bound to give you an autograph sometime!!<br>  <br>  Don't cry...Juaquin will soon realize he a piece of crap whitey who can't rap just like Britney's ex Kevin, what a disaster...<br>  <br>  what an embarrassment....
NQ3eETlYaa	I thought it was definitely interesting, and had a good plot because mirrors are extremely common. This scares the audience even more because it's horrifying to look at your reflection after watching the movie.<br>  <br>  **** SPOILER ****<br>  <br>  I think the demon grandma part was a bit extreme, but, hey, it certainly added uniqueness!

That part was totally awesome. :)|`|XCVFEAC8aa	i thought it was awesome!<br>  i loved it!|`|dtmdsQMFaa	I saw it, and it was pretty good! I was surprised at how cinematic is was!

4qVWj3UHaa	Fuchia : Safari Zone, Pokemon Center, Gym, Warden's house, and Fisherman's house. The Safari Zone is required stop, since you need to get both Surf and the Gold Teeth from it to move further in the game. The warden's house is where you will trade the Gold Teeth for the HM for Strength (HM 04), and the Fisherman's house (Both the Wardens's house and the fisherman's house is next to each other in the lower right part of Fuchia), is home to the Super Rod, the best of all 3 of the rods.<br>  In the Safari Zone over on the upper left side of it is a house where you get Surf. I think the teeth are near a different house on the right upper part ( use item finder).<br>  To get the Warden's Golden Teeth and the HM for surf, from the beginning, go right, and up until you see a enterance to another area. From the next area, go right until you see a opening, up, and right until you see a ladder to a platform. From there, go left, down, left, up, right up the platform, right, down, right, up, left, down, and right. From the third area, go left to the second platform, up left, down left, up, right, up, lrft, and down to area 4. In area for, go straight until you get the Gold Teeth, and from there, go right and up to the surf house to get the HM for surf.<br>  happy hunting<br>  <br>  <(*_*)>|`|hzH75VDXaa	In Fuschia city there is a secret house at the end of the safari zone.

The man should be here soon.' <br>  <br>  Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby <br>  photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. <br>  <br>  'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...' <br>  <br>  'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've <br>  been expecting you.' <br>  <br>  'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. <br>  <br>  Did you know babies are my specialty?' <br>  <br>  'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and <br>  have a seat'. <br>  <br>  After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?' <br>  <br>  'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on <br>  the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the <br>  living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.' <br>  <br>  'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry <br>  and me!' <br>  <br>  'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But <br>  if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven <br>  angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.' <br>  <br>  'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith <br>  <br>  'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to <br>  be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed <br>  with that.' <br>  <br>  'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly <br>  <br>  The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of <br>  his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said . <br>  <br>  'Oh, my word!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat. <br>  'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider <br>  their mother was so difficult to work with.' <br>  <br>  'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith . <br>  <br>  'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get <br>  the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep<br>  to get a good look' <br>  <br>  'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith , her eyes wide with amazement. <br>  <br>  'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, <br>  too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could <br>  hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my<br>  shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, <br>  I just had to pack it all in.' <br>  <br>  Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on <br>  your, uh...equipment?' <br>  <br>  'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my <br>  tripod and we can get to work right away.' <br>  <br>  'Tripod?' <br>  <br>  'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's <br>  much too big to be held in the hand very long.' <br>  <br>  Mrs. Smith fainted.|`|Xar3YgiRaa	if quizes are quizzical then what are tests.....<br>  <br>  Did you get it XD|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Who's This Guy<br>  <br>  After a long night of making love, the young guy rolled over, pulled out a cigarette from his jeans and searched for his lighter. <br>  <br>  Unable to find it, he asked the girl if she had one at hand.<br>  <br>  "There might be some matches in the top drawer," she replied.<br>  <br>  He opened the drawer of the bedside table and found a box of matches sitting neatly on top of a framed picture of another man. <br>  <br>  Naturally, the guy began to worry.<br>  <br>  "Is this your husband?" he inquired nervously.<br>  <br>  "No, silly," she replied, snuggling up to him.<br>  <br>  "Your boyfriend then?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "No, not at all," she said, nibbling away at his ear.<br>  <br>  "Well, who is he then?" demanded the bewildered guy.<br>  <br>  Calmly, the girl replied, "That's me before the operation."|`|G26O8ecfaa	Only in America..Ever Wonder?<br>  <br>  Only in America .......do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.<br>  <br>  Only in America .....do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a diet coke.<br>  <br>  Only in America .....do banks leave both doors open and then chain the pens to the counters.<br>  <br>  Only in America ......do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.<br>  <br>  Only in America ......do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille letterin<br>  <br>  EVER WONDER ... <br>  <br>  Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens <br>  our skin?<br>  <br>  Why don't you ever see the headline 'Psychic Wins Lottery'<br>  <br>  Why is it that doctors call what they do 'practice<br>  <br>  Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons?<br>  <br>  You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes?

e7KoyoWsaa	What I would do is download karaoke songs using torrents.  If your not familiar with how to do this follow some tutorials.  Then, I would download and install Audacity. This is a free sound editing program that supports multitracking.  Multitracking is the ability to record one track while playing another.  Then it's a matter of mixing the two together and saving it as an MP3.<br>  <br>  This may sound a little complicated, but there are tutorials to do it all.  I don't know of any websites that would do it for you, in fact I think it would not be possible to record stuff real time on the internet with any decent quality - although i may be wrong.
DfbR2Traaa	that totally went over my head|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I've had that theory for a while, so I'm not surprised. I don't know why she did it, but I felt that Vanessa might've been covering for her. I SO wish it had been Vanessa though!|`|AA12336927	Aww, I missed the very end, but in the beginning I brought up that possibility asking what if Vanessa was really protecting Lola. It makes sense, if she had really come to love Lola and not wanting her to be in trouble for it along with getting Ray out of the way and keeping all his money|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I do think the writer's have lost it. Why couldn't they leave Vanessa as the murderer? No one likes her. I think they are trying to keep her character on OLTL so they switched plans to make Vanessa the killer and made Lola the killer instead. It stinks to high He**.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I haven't seen the show yet but I heard a rumor a while ago that Lola was the killer.|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	I heard it too.  It really doesn't make sense.  How could she have believed her father did it all this time if she knew she did?  Makes no sense.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I'm not surprised but I was hoping that Vanessa was the guilty one.|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I couldn't believe I was hearing it!  Why would Lola kill her own mother?<br>  <br>  Even though it seems that Vanessa is covering for Lola, I still don't like Vanessa & am glad she's in jail & away from Christian. <br>  <br>  I don't know where the writers got the idea for this story, but it is pretty stupid!|`|012f12e232d8e79e847320dd32943a10aa	I heard what she said at the end of the show.<br>  I think if it is her that killed her mom, it's because she saw her in bed with someone else...remember Ray said his wife was having an affair so maybe Lola killed her mom after she & Ray argued about the affair.|`|jqKBebDdaa	I don't know but I Have a feeling that lola is going to UCLA with markko. they are gonna get married or something so she don't have to go back to columbia.

pTERJdzQaa	Thats sad :[ that someone with that much talent would be turned down solely because of her age, most likely comic and/or manga publishing companys and producers have a certain age limit to who they accept and they are most likely critical about age, so since she is 12 they deny her on the spot, and that S*** is not fair, but I guess life isnt fair. They really should have given her a chance.<br>  They are to blind to see that Age is just a number, it doesnt define our talents.|`|dY61VnW2aa	well i do think she is a little too young for a comic artist....even tho she got the talent nobody accepted her...cuz of her age...there is nothing we can do about it..we r not the publishers...<br>  but tell her dont give up tho if shes got the talent eventually she will be accepted! ^^ i do strongly believe!|`|rNxK7cY8aa	Well Tokyo Pop has the Rising Stars of Manga. If she really wants to try and get her idea out there right now and the editors are that caught up on her being mature for her age, see if she'll tone down the maturity a little. And then try sending it to that contest or another editor.<br>  And even if she doesn't win/get published in the next year or two, she is only twelve. She has quite a few years ahead of her before its too late. And the world of comics and manga is a tough place, if she gets suicidal after getting turned down a time or two she doesn't need to try it (I'm sorry that sounds harsh for a 12 year old, but its true). She just has to keep trying, and eventually someone will accept her if she's this amazing. Look at Stephen King for instance (even though he's not a manga artist). He had to publish his early stories in porno mags and stuff like the national inquirer  for years before a big publisher accepted him. (I'm definitely not saying your cousin should do this, but I'm using him as an example of someone who had to work a hard and long time to get where he is.) But he kept trying. And now everything he writes makes the best sellers list.<br>  She just can't let everyone that turns her down get to her like that. She has to be able get up and try again and again and again if she really wants this.|`|mc3rO1Gyaa	she is a little to young to get it out there but i would say if she does it again good job.

w5d0kET5aa	They don't know that lister is the last human being alive, but he was in suspended animation for 3 million years.  As Rimmer points out, the Cat race evolved from Frankenstein in 3 million years.  Any descendants of humanity would no longer be human.  You never do find out what happened to the other ark.

Its REAL hip hop but instead of making the youth think its cool to be a gangster they should motivate them to do better.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	That people use the effects of hip-hop to portray how hard they are and how deal crack. When kids are listening to this stuff and going about them being there idols when there doing stuff like dealing drugs, killing, and about how hard they are as kids reflect some of there idols. You could really extend that and show how it is one of the most negative things. There are a lot more positives to me then negatives.|`|Zi725CfIaa	rap music is just as poetic as any other genre, but some rappers sing about not-so great things. you know what i mean. and sometimes this puts an idea into kids' heads that it's alright to do the things that their favorite rapper does. I have nothing against rap music, but theres a negative effect to everything, right?|`|Xop4uVHXaa	I think rap is more aggressive and hardcore about street life and gangs and killing <br>  <br>  hip hop got a really nice beat and a big dance like the booty shake and 2step and all that stuff in the club. hip hop is about living in a rich world( throw em up) (get crunk) (get hyphie) different parts everywhere has different styles <br>  <br>   when rap is mostly about poverty ghettos and drugs and dealing and gang life <br>  <br>  But their is also different rap out their they are not all the same  especially far from the kind we listen to on the radio as a majority

XDrudPeAaa	Hey, I'm going today too! From what I've heard, the House of Blues in Boston just got renovated, so it should be pretty big (I went to it a couple years ago before it was renovated, and it was quite small). As for how long it will last, I saw concerts usually last anywhere from 2-3 hours, but that's just a guess for me.
akGha9mqaa	take band. i m asian too . i quit band in my junior year which is this year but it looks bad on ur college transcript if u only did somethin 4 two years. do all 4 years and u dont really need after school math n science. just study on ur own or wit a group of friends. remember if ur asian math n science should be natural.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Do it boy/girl.  <br>  Hell yea<br>  Could get a music scholarship if your dirt(awesome at it).<br>  Haha azn's work hard (do you work hard)<br>  Well anyways. <br>  Just stick through it.<br>  Have mad fun<br>  Cause after high school and college: when are you going to play.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	Follow your heart!  Do whatever you want!  Why do I care?!|`|mIj2EtY5aa	take band all four years. it looks good on a college application, <br>  plus, it's a good class to just kinda relax a bit.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	yes elevate your mind too new things.

I regret not taking band.. Football lasts a few years but, the knowledge of music lasts a lifetime.|`|uff3kOoFaa	i think u should stay in band. if you like it, whats the point in quitting?|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Well, what matters to you more? Band, or the things you want to do in the time that band consumes? You don't need to do band/choir/etc to get into college, unless you're hoping for some sort of band scholarship (not sure if they have those or not). I was a Freshman last year, and it was a difficult decision to drop Choir. But it took up too much time, and I have other things I'd rather be doing. The math and science clubs, on one hand, can definitely help with a scholarship. Just imagine, a year down the road, what you'd be happier doing. I'm sure you'll make the right choice.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I only took band for one year because it was keeping me from going to my other clubs, and I got into six colleges.  They liked the diversity I had because I was able to go to more clubs without band, and yet, I still knew how to play an instrument.  I took band again when I was in college.|`|x7CmpR6baa	Stick with it, you've probably got some good talent, don't let it go to waste, trust me if you don't stick with it, you'll regret it later in life.|`|xL6McXTfaa	you should take band.  Because if you don't you will regret it for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  what do you play? just out of curiosity.|`|JWDfOTX2aa	Colleges like band students. Plus, band teaches you so many things like discipline and responsibility(:|`|8955f4d866b69f97b83ea516833b5a93aa	Yes! Band is the greatest! And it gets even better in high school! <br>  <br>  And Colleges love band kids. I remember it's what helped me get accepted into college!|`|uOihCBDHaa	yes, take band. music is the way.|`|5CkOAyrraa	You could always take a different elective at school and audition for some bands in your area (like near me we have all district band and flute choirs and stuff).  That way you can decide when you have time for it and when you don't.  You could continue private lessons too (assuming you already take them. Cuz i mean, you really don't have to give up the instrument, but if there is something on like your elective sheet that you really wish you had room for....<br>  <br>  <br>  i wouldnt call you a quitter if you decided not to do band! (not that I know you...) but i take band right now too, (cept im in 8th grade) and I'm not taking it next year just cuz i do it for fun, I don't think it will help me in life.  (it might help u if u wanna play professionally but yea.)|`|6MLqrB3faa	All three look good on a college application. However,  if you do not have enough time to stay after for all three then figure out which on you can do more of on your free time at home. Good luck!|`|GZZyJJfZaa	follow your heat retard<br>  <br>  do whatever you want know ones cares<br>  <br>  why the hell would i care if your in ******* band of not?

966c4e8864b6a9310adef66899b02203aa	It is quite a bit shorter. This is the only season that they haven't had the live audition show and the finale isn't set up the way it was before. Before there was a show, the episode before the finale, that was used for the two final crews to battle and nothing else. This time they didn't do that, they just worked it out so their final dances were used for them to go head to head. <br>  <br>  Sadly, I have a feeling this might be the final season of ABDC...But I hope I'm wrong on that.|`|Ia7nddGhaa	I agree.

ngRZGMckaa	What the eff happened to Paris's last BFF Brittany, anyway? Guess it just didn't work out, and Paris was like, "TTYN!" and then she flew to London. And then she realized that British people are pretty crackin', and maybe she could find a new BFF there? After all, the accents are soooo fierce and Paris would have a really good excuse to adopt her own faux accent. Anyway, what we're saying here is that season 2 of Paris Hilton's My New BFF is about to kick off, and you can see all episodes (as they happen) online at watch.muchmusic.com. Then you can get a fake accent too, and annoy your own BFFs.

mlihk1Nbaa	Deffinelty better than a lot of people. The song very much suited your voice however some parts were slightly flat (slightly lower than the correct note). Not bad though. I would like to hear you sing songs that showcase your range more. I love your husky/rock tone. Also your vibrato!<br>  Try a couple techniques to exorsise your diaphram to belt higher notes.<br>   <br>  1. Deep breath through diaphram (your stomach should enlarge not your shoulders and chest.)<br>  <br>  2. Do re me fa so.... From the use of fluttering your lips. (avoid blowing fluent air, flutter lips only!)<br>  <br>  3. Ya Ha Ha Ha Ya Ha Ha Ha (say that and get higher each verse)<br>   <br>  Keep singing!|`|iAEPYfcPaa	much better than others that i have heard.<br>  pitchy in some parts.<br>  i don't specialize in singing, so i don't know what to catagorize you as. sorry.. =p

2k8TEiRtaa	I admire your courage and determination. I don't what the employment laws are in the UK, but here working after school at McDonald's or sweeping parking lots will get extra money. Wash cars etc.|`|fpnvzqICaa	babysitting?|`|zdRTozVxaa	Your best bet would be finding a local paper route and/or post flyers to be a baby-sitter. Sorry if that sounds cliche but at your age that's the best option. <br>  <br>  Also check your local grocery to see if they hire baggers at your age. Here in the states, I know that Kroger Co will hire 15 year olds as baggers but I don't know the employment age over there.<br>  <br>  Out of what I just said, a paper route would be your best bet. There's usually a lower age limit for that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

12QJ9QMRaa	Actually... it annoys me when ANY guitarist (or drummer or pbassist, etc) is called the "Bestest Ever".<br>  <br>  Really?  And how did we determine that?<br>  <br>  I am a firm believer that someone may be ONE OF THE BEST, but with all the differences in techniques, genres, lifetimes, etc...just how do we determine if ANYONE is the best?  What is the objective standard that they can all be neatly judged by?<br>  <br>  I understand people have favorites, and that People feel a need to rate everything, and that there certainly ARE people who stand head and shoulders aove the rest, but it is simply impossible to categorically claim ANYONE is the best at what they do (even Wolverine).<br>  <br>  So those Questions do annoy me.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	There are too many to enjoy to say who is best. We also have to consider different time periods.<br>  <br>  Before rock and roll, Les Paul and Charley Christian had people's jaws dropping with their jazz guitar prowess. Another who quietly mastered just about every style was Chet Atkins. At one point it seemed like he worked with everyone including Mark Knopler of Dire Straits.<br>  <br>  I've always enjoyed Little Steven Van Zandt's approach to playing: "I'm there to serve the song. Any solo over 20 seconds and I'm bored." Then we have Argentinian rock guitarist Skay Beilinson who can solo with the best but prefers to lay down mosaics of small chords for interesting underscores to his songs.<br>  <br>  So who or what is best? Whatever we like at the moment.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	I agree with Shred, Killer Peaches, and A.G.<br>  <br>  Instead of putting OMG OMG ERIC CLAPTON IS A GUITAR GAWD AND IS THE BESTEST EVER!!!!!!!111111111, people should say, "In my opinion, ______ is the best guitarist ever."|`|KEk728Gsaa	I agree. "Best" isn't a synonym for "most well known"|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Hey Leah.<br>  <br>  I think Peaches nailed it, there really isn't much I could say otherwise.<br>  <br>  I will add this.  I honestly don't think people answer those questions honestly and unbiased.  I think when those questions get asked most of the answers are that person's favorite.  We all have a favorite guitarist, and we all think they are the "best", that is what makes us fans.  I could list pages of reasons why I think Brian May is the best guitarist, but I could also do it for Clapton, Hendrix, Page, SRV, Eddie Van Halen, etc.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Only time I hear that is on here, in my world as off of  R&P, I don't hear it as much. As we all know there are great guitar players, and some not to great. as one best over all the others noway, there are so many styles, that we can't come to an answer for that question. And another thing a lot of people on here like myself, don't or fall into that category of not so great a guitar player as myself, falls into not a great player, but ones who gets by. One thing for sure, there are a lot of great players, out there in all fields of music.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|NC67WVlEaa	I see what you mean. There are so many factors to consider when thinking about a guitarist. Technique, skill, originality, etc. etc. I can hardly see how anyone could chose just one as "the best" or even a top 10, for that matter. Yes, it does annoy me a bit.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	yes, its impossible to choose one because there are different styles and people choose because thay like their music. some are fast, skilled, or innovators, and some are simply JIMMY PAGE. <br>  <br>  btw, this relates to the Qs about slash, isn′t it??|`|3ZH3BUSYaa	I agree, there are many to pick as THE BEST.<br>  Also, many different people have many different opinions on which guitarists are the best of ALL.|`|wgYMHW9Naa	YES, like Slash and all of the ones you named.  I'm sick of hearing it!  I gotta include Jimmy Page too.  Or Angus Young.  OMG.  I hate him|`|Catsy82Caa	they're usually (read: always) wrong. the top three is always page/hendrix/van halen or something like that|`|16t0eV0Uaa	There is no such thing as the best... you can be the fastest sweep picking, most clean and precise Neo Classical guitarist, and still people would prefer someone like say Slash because they will say he gives more "feeling" and "emotion" into his solos, no its a matter of opinion and perspective.  We human beings are silly creatures, we can never all agree on one thing ever.  So maybe a guy who has been playing guitar for 20 year's pick for best guitarist may be more credible then a 13 year old who has no experience in music at all, but still, the 13 year old will stand by his pick because that is what he truly think is the best.<br>  <br>  Now, when you ask... say a Basketball fan who the best Basketball player is, its a lot less about opinion and more about facts.. usually people end up picking Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlin or in some cases... Oscar Robertson.  They base these upon how many points they scored, rebounds they had, how many championships they won, how many assist and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Now.. since there is NOTHING we can base a guitarist as being the best upon by nothing but technicality, there is no standard in which we are able to judge who the best guitarist is.  The best guitarist I suppose is who you think is the best... but that does not make them the best, it just means you favor him more.<br>  So in essence a "best" guitarist does not exist... people may think malmsteem is the best, then someone else would say Jason Becker is more talented than malmsteem and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  That is the beauty about art, you can perceive it any way you want it, and the beauty of humans is... we don't have to all like the same exact thing... still I find "the best guitarist ever" list amusing, because NO ONE is going to agree with the list completely except the person who wrote it and how boring would it be if we all agreed on the list and had nothing to argue about?|`|2FIbamFgaa	Yah. Favorites are fine. Bests can't really be labeled accurately at all cause it's all opinion. (Not to mention, it just asks for trolls)<br>  But again, favorites are just fine with me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And about the Hendrix/Edge question, I think comparisons are fine because those are understood to be opinion. But again, I agree: The question should have been who do you like better, not who is the most talented.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I try to tag "imo" at the ends of all my answers to "best" questions because thats all it is, my opinion.|`|gxYKJiCYaa	I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT when people say Hammett is the best. Sure he's decent, but C'MON! NO he's not the best! He's not even close! <br>  <br>  To be completely honest though, I think it's ridiculous to compare guitarists, sure, some are better than others, that's obvious, but to compare a great to another great... well... it's ridiculous to say the least. Each guitarist has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own genre they play.|`|01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	We all have our favorites.<br>  <br>       Guitar Player magazine once did an article on the late, great Danny Gatton, calling him the "World's Greatest Unknown Guitarist."<br>  ( there's a few videos on Youtube)<br>  <br>       I'm a big fan of Gatton, and he could play it all..jazz, rockabilly, country, rock, blues, and eventhough I appreciate the technique of Gatton, I can't say he's my favorite.<br>  <br>       Gatton often played a mile a minute, as if he was trying to fit as many notes as possible in before his too short life ended.<br>  <br>       Fast is fine, but I prefer a bit of space once in a while.  You have to know when to lay back.<br>  <br>       Besides Gatton, some of my personal favorites are Nokie Edwards (The Ventures), Jimi, of course, Stephen Stills, Mike Bloomfield, and 3 studio musicians who call themselves The Hellecasters...phenominal playing!<br>  <br>       But are any of these the best?  No..as others have said...there's Robert Johnson, Chet atkins, Segovia, D'Jango Reinhart, Joe Pass, and a never ending list of fine players.|`|XB4w8SS4aa	Robert Johnson said to be the father of the delta blues as well as rock only recorded a few songs in 1936&37 in a hotel room.He is rated as the No.5 best ever. Kieth Richards after hearing his music for the first time insisted there were two guitar players, not so just Robert.The recordings are crude but worth the time of anyone who loves the guitar.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	yeah.with any instrument actually.  one that really pisses me off is people calling travis barker the best drummer ever. travis sucks compared to buddy rich, john bonham, jojo mayer etc. it's too difficult to decide on one since there's so many different styles and stuff.|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	It's annoys me when anyone is listed as the "best" We all have our favorites and prefer them first but that doesn't make them the best. They all came up learning the same fundamentals and it just comes down to some being more talented than others.|`|PJ3Fcpbpaa	Absolutely|`|7sqpiGgoaa	good point... it is all art.. there is no winner in art, just great art|`|AA10368587	theirs too many styles to label one person as the best guitarist.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I am in that area of mindset as Peaches. It used to drive me insane when people would say for example "Jimmy Page is THE BEST"<br>  <br>  Its a form of arrogance in itself. Its just arrogant especially when a lot of people do it in ignorance. I am saying that without prejudice and hate meaning its not stupidity but just flat a lack of knowledge of many other very talented players. <br>  <br>  There is no BEST EVER guitarist. I don't have time to get into why i am tired of it many have seen my written point and complaint and I have had a lot of people agree. It doesn't bother me much anymore its never going to change. When people say "Jimmy Page is my favorite therefor I think hes the best IN MY OPINION" that's more than acceptable to me.|`|JSryPP8faa	As everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so am I. I just choose not to judge or be annoyed. Many of my favorite guitar player's are in the background, not the lead. Thank's for the question and hello Leah.
CEEQDSCFaa	like that other person said, caps are independent so you dont really fix a capricorn rather they fix themselves but its always nice to have someone around in those times<br>  <br>  caps ussualy get over these things but having cheated on makes him think about his self worth, his self esteem is really fragile right now, its cool that your being sensitive on the matter.<br>  <br>  once in a blue moon will a cap look for emotional support, the fact that he opened up to you in a situation like this, he trusts that whatever he feels you wouldnt make it worst, so just keep at what your doing and be a good friend. he'll be fine.|`|xUxUwloPaa	Damn. Just listen. I've been in the same situation that your friend is in and it's the worst. Listening to what he has to say and (by ego stroking i'm assuming you mean telling him "you can get a better girlfriend", "you were too good for her anyway", etc.) continuing emotional reinforcement you are being a great friend.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	capricorns are a depressing sign. <br>  they are hard to do so. <br>  they bring me down because of their depressive nature. <br>  goodluck. <br>  give them noney...heard they like that.|`|0tJl0L5Raa	you should make out with him.|`|UajHxo3Daa	It doesn't matter what sign that they are. Every person is different and act differently in any given situation. Me for example my friend likes to sit in a dark room and watch sad movies and eat a gallon of ice cream while I like to forget about it and go do something fun like go the water park or the amusement park and we are the same sign.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	capri never thinks about past.. <br>  once if ex is out of his life then he doesn't even care if he was her 5 th ot 50th boyfriend..<br>  <br>  i am surprised ur capricorn is doing that to you... they are just one liners.. how much they are hurt they say everything in a line and then sulk all by them selves for a while...btw i am not  a capri|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Get him involved in a project where he helps people it will make him feel better about himself.  Maybe you have a "honey do" project he could help you with.  Think of something you need his help for.|`|spjDVZgzaa	Ask him this question:<br>  If a unicorn has one horn, then how many horns does a capricorn have?|`|AA11209233	Don't fix a capricorn, just be there for him.  They are independent for starters, and if you try to force them to move their life forward or be happy they will be stubborn and resist.  Also, capricorns don't always show their emotions, so you can't assume one is down just because he isn't up--they often appear to be unemotional no matter what is going on in their heads.  <br>  <br>  Just be there for him.  If you want to make him happy, don't help him through this.  Distract him from it.  He'll work it out on his own or he'll ask for an ear to whine at or some help with his problems if he needs it.|`|cVVvHNXSaa	Keep doing what you're doing, its helping a lot. A bit of encouragement always help.

5yaNeOcSaa	I think that there is not enough planetary alignment to keep it going.  You need stronger ties to keep it alive.  There are many planets  in many houses that determine what kind of girl you are and what kind of guy he is.  If one day you have extra time run  a SYNASTRY chart between the two of you at www.astro.com and see what I mean.  You should have the birth dates for this and preferably the birth times.|`|AsLTO8CTaa	i like to play hard to get also so i know what u mean. but im also a taurus and i know how long we can take to show someone how we feel. my suggestion is if u want him make a move other wise you will be waiting on him and that could take forever.

ufU0VNLUaa	The Brazilian Carnival, properly spelled Carnaval, is an annual festival in Brazil held four days before Ash Wednesday, the day of fasting and repentance that marks the beginning of Lent. On certain days of Lent, Roman Catholics and some other Christians traditionally abstained from the consumption of meat and poultry -- hence the term "carnival," from carnelevare, "to remove (literally, "raise") meat."Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the pagan festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to certain pleasures of the flesh in a season of religious discipline to practice repentance and prepare for Christ's death and resurrection.<br>  <br>  Brazilian Carnival exhibits some differences from its European counterparts, having mixed African, Native and Euro elements. Furthermore, rhythm, participation, and costume vary from one region of Brazil to another. For example, in the southeastern cities of Rio de Janeiro and S?o Paulo, organized parades led by samba schools vie for prizes on the "sambodromo" open stage. Only samba-school affiliates participate in the shows. Smaller cities often have no public events but promote balls in recreational clubs.<br>  <br>  <br>  The northeastern cities of Salvador, Porto Seguro and Recife have organized groups parading through streets, but watchers are also welcome to dance. They follow the "trio elétrico" floats through the city streets.<br>  <br>  Modern Brazilian Carnival originated in Rio de Janeiro in 1641, when the city's bourgeoisie imported the practice of holding balls and masquerade parties from Paris. It originally mimicked the European form of the festival, later absorbing and creolizing elements derived from Native American and African cultures.<br>  <br>  In the late 19th century, the cord?es (literally laces or strings in Portuguese) were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocos (blocks), consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special t-shirts with themes and/or logos. Blocos are generally associated with particular neighborhoods; they include both a percussion or music group and an entourage of revellers.<br>  <br>  Bloc parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase each year. Blocos can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a distinct title that mocks an issue or celebrity. They may also note their neighborhood or social status. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade in sections of the city, often near the beach. Some blocos never leave one street and have a particular place, such as a bar, to attract viewers. Bloc parades start in January, and may last until Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday).<br>  <br>  "Blocos" parade in Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Lagoa, Jardim Botanico, and in downtown Rio. Organizers often compose their own music themes that are added to the performance and singing of classic "marchinhas" and samba popular songs. "Cord?o do bola preta" ("Black Ball Bloc"), that goes through the heart of Rio's historical center, and "Suvaco do Cristo" (Christ's statue armpit), near the Botanical Garden, are some of the most famous groups. Monobloco has become so famous that it plays all year round at parties and small concerts.<br>  <br>  Samba schools are very large groups of performers, financed by respected organizations (as well as suspect ones), who work year round in preparation for Carnival. Samba Schools perform in the Sambadrome, which runs four entire nights. They are part of an official competition, divided into seven divisions, in which a single school is declared the winner, according to costume, flow, theme, and band music quality and performance. Some samba schools also hold street parties in their neighborhoods, through which they parade along with their followers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ok yeah, if you don't want to read all that just follow this link lol: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_C...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

PhCGFouvaa	The Phoenix would win!<br>  The Phoenix's power is on the level comparable with the Cosmic Entities of the Marvel Universe while Apocalypse maybe powerful but he's still only a mutant.<br>  Like the "User" stated both of them are immortal but the Phoenix is way to powerful that she can just vaporized the entire body of Apocalypse until it disintegrates completely!!<br>  As for Magneto vs Apocalypse as the "User" explained Apocalypse would win! Apocalypse may have metallic armor but it is half Organic that is the same with Mr. Sinister. Magneto would not be able to control them with that element in it.<br>  As for hyperstorm/franklin richards/scarlet vs. apocalypse, Apocalypse would against both Hyperstorm and Scarlet Witch but it might end up in a tie with Franklin Richards since his Psionic abilities is as powerful as X-Man himself!!|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Apocalypse controls every molecule of his body.  Magneto would not be able to effect him directly.  In fact, Magneto wouldn't be able to fight him alone for more than a few seconds.  Apocalypse is just to versatile, impervious to harm and strong.  <br>  Phoenix, on the other hand, would probably be able to take him.  She is also immortal as she will rise from seeming death.  She lacks his physical abilities but it would be a mental ability, power, and molecule manipulating fight.  In any case, it would be bad if it occurred on Earth or even in our universe.  We would surely perish.

I say it deserved every single one of those 8 oscars.

It makes you horny but most guys get coke dick and either can't get hard or can't ***.

Vd92Vlsfaa	The five-episode season was supposed to air Monday - Friday at 9pm on BBC One, but recently BBC America have said that they are going to air Torchwood season three simultaneously with the UK because it's their most popular show and they said they would air it in June, so it looks like a June airdate for the UK.  <br>  The entire season is five episodes and will run on five consecutive nights and will be called The Children of Earth, involving a deal made by aliens and the government decades before that affects every child on Earth.

ecL0ZbfCaa	All three are very different and equally brilliant in their own way.<br>  <br>  I would probably rank them as:<br>  <br>  1  'Blood On The Tracks' - This is my favourite because it is so honest and at times painful to listen to, you almost feel you are intruding. Written while he was splitting up with his wife.<br>  2  'Blonde On Blonde' - This is probably the peak of his 60's career and is such a strong selection of songs.  I love the subtlety of the musicianship on this one, recorded in Nashville.  The perfect 3am album.<br>  3  'Highway 61 Revisited' - What can I say, one the most perfect rock albums ever recorded, it never lets up,  never tire of listening to this one.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think anyone can equal Dyan as a lyricist.|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Highway 61 Revisited<br>  <br>  Leonard Cohen<br>  Neil Young<br>  Johnny Cash<br>  Wille Nelson|`|DnWsMhwLaa	blonde on blonde<br>  <br>  on par with dylan? not many if any... maybe leonard cohen... gil scott heron, paul simon...|`|npWHktB2aa	Blonde on Blonde<br>  <br>  Neil Young|`|1iqeWBisaa	Blonde on Blonde would be my choice.<br>  <br>  Lennon would be similar<br>  Brian Wilson at least on Pet Sounds|`|LkN5nr6faa	Highway 61 Revisited for Like a Rolling Stone, Tombstone Blues, Desolation Row, and H 61 Rev.<br>  <br>  Lyrically, Neil Young and I'll give a nod to Lou Reed.

Ypu could re0nt a limo to pick you up from school, and have it stocked with food, drinks, maybe a tv and some music, go to a resturaunt, then drop your friends off at their houses.

The mountains really make it great, if you can get a nice vista.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Everything all boils down to the physics of driving.<br>  <br>  I am from MD and I cannot, cannot stand the morons in this state. Va is bad too...I hate when people ride on your bumper. They are in a hurry to just sit at a red light. It's pointless. All I do is stop really fast and make them scared. I hate people who feel the need to go so fast in back of me.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also hate people that don't know how to handle their vehicle properly during a turn or hill. You do not need to brake every 3 seconds when on a hill. There is absolutely no reason. In fact, during a curve, especially if going up hill, you should be speeding up..not slowing down...there is no reason for stopping every second. The morons don't realize that their car will not tip over!<br>  <br>  Another thing is when people feel the need to go really slowly on train tracks. A science class seriously should be added to the driving ed program. Your car will rock even more if you go slowly over bumps and tracks. Obviously you won't feel the bump as much if you are at a good speed.<br>  <br>  The acceleration produced by a net force on an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, is the same direction as the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object. In other words, net force divided by mass is equal to acceleration. If you have a net force that is greater and the mass is the same, the object's acceleration will be higher. If the mass is greater and the net force is the same, the acceleration of the object will be lower.<br>  <br>  Newton's Second Law uses these three formulas: F=ma, A=f/m, M=f/a. The F, M and A stand for these things: F=force, m=mass of object, a=acceleration. The standard units for acceleration are m/s2. The standard units for mass is kg. When we calculate force, we use the unit Newton(N) or kg times m/s2.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	The best from my experiences is Oregon and the worst is New Mexico|`|AA11865684	Colorado....the Rocky Mountains are awesome!<br>  <br>  Arizona......I just don't like deserts,they look dead to me.|`|2bUIDeefaa	oklahoma, kansas and texas are horrid<br>  <br>  alaska is the prettiest :)<br>  and oregon<br>  and colorado|`|128833184801fb3ff90fe4b271c5a6efaa	Worst hands down is Kansas.

I didn't know a place could be so flat (and I was born in the Midwest!), and if you see a tree, take a picture because that's your scenery!<br>  Runner Up - Delaware<br>  <br>  Best - That's a toss up.  Colorado is mostly gorgeous.  All of New England is amazing.  Yes, upstate NY is also beautiful.  If you get off the freakin' Turnpike and go west, parts of NJ are quite pretty.

bXL9937haa	I am a Virgo and I see what you are talking about. Most Virgo's that I know are givers. The only time I would see a Virgo doing that is if they do a lot and don't get anything back. In other words, they are tying to let you know that you should put in as much effort as they do when it comes to giving. Hint, hint. That drives Virgo's crazy. When they keep giving and perfecting and the other person never shows their gratitude and tries to reciprocate. It makes them feel taken advantage of and emotional scarred. This is just my opinion.|`|MtANnIlfaa	Wtf I have a gemini cousin that is exactly what you described and it annoys the crap out of me, I feel like smacking her in the face. I'll ask "Hey can you give me so and so's number?" and she'll sigh and say "OMG I already did you a favor i told you where the remote was!!" and complain on and on to everyone.

They want to feel appreciated maybe?|`|6NZeItMAaa	The sense of feeling and touch is very accu-rate in these people, and by practice and drilling they quickly develop rare psy-chometric gifts. With proper training, these Virgo people may grow into the most powerful spiritual physicians. When entirely on the intellectual plane, they are crucial in their criticisms, and often become arbitrary and selfish, expecting perfection.|`|lOkWLI9Caa	Why do Virgos do this and why do Virgos do that? etc......

I think the worry of being accused of that may be what stops there being hip hop standards. <br>  <br>  Jean Grae did a great reworking of Jay's Threats. Jay did a great one of Ice-T's 99 Problems. But to directly cover a rap song is something I don't think would go down too well in the rap community. <br>  <br>  Rap lyrics tend to be so personal that I think it would be pretty difficult to do. <br>  <br>  Unless you count A Millie.<br>  <br>  edit @ Tam- very good point. I forgot about that one. I actually kinda like the Everlast cover. He sings it rather than raps it - which he's better at anway.|`|bribxhsdaa	Hmm.. This is a really good question. Although I doubt a lot of people will know what is meant by "standard"<br>  <br>  Considering the concept of a musical standard is closely intune with the musical theory of that genre and hip hop isn't gonna be associated with musical theory any time soon., It's hard to pinpoint one/many for hip hop. <br>  <br>  I Can name you dozens of hip hop anthems...But standards, not so much.

zZ3Uxllfaa	they will grow up just fine they seem lovely little boys and with the right guidance from their dad become great adults too<br>  <br>  they will never forget their mum i read that she has written cards for each of their future birthdays and words of advice for when they get older,I think thats nice thats she's able to do that so many people don't get the chance to say what they want or feel  .Whatever people think of Jade she has always had their best interests at heart  at the end of the day she is a normal person trying her best .There are hard times ahead for all of them my thoughts are with them|`|FcHplZtQaa	Their gonna live with their dad, who most likely will meet someone else and have other children so they'll grow up in a typical family environment.<br>  <br>  It's been stated by Jeff Brazier that Jack won't be getting any access, and Jacky Jades mum will be getting limited access, so ultimately the majority of the childcare will be Jeff and his family!|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I hope they grow up in privacy and left out of the limelight..Their father is to have them but their will be plenty of love surrounding them and at least they are old enough to be able to recall memories of their mum..............|`|aZjZyccsaa	I think the best thing for Jades sons is to grow up out of the public eye, hopefully Jeff will be able to make this happen.....|`|fYcYPyR3aa	To be honest they probably won't remember her a lot because they are so young, of course they will remember how she looks and have a few memories of her but time does take that away from you, especially if they of when you are 4/5. That's why I think it's great she's doing the RTV show on living and the wedding, so they'll have something to watch at and see how strong she was and what kind of person she was and how her voice sounds, I know I wish I had something like that of my mum who died when I was 13, but then I do actually remember a lot about her, I just am worried I won't when I'm older so videos following her life if only a bit of it would have been great. My friend's dad died when she was five, she doesn't remember him a lot but she remembers how he smelt and what his face was like. I don't know who they're staying but whoever it is (maybe their dad or Jack Tweed?) I hope they bring them up well and keep her in their minds.|`|kyiUpgrwaa	i think they will be find there both still young so they will adapt to life they still have Jeff,Jack and Jackie to look out for them and the money Jade had made to put away for there futures.<br>  <br>  also look at prince William and Harry they lost there mother at a young age and there doing alright.<br>  <br>  i feel really sorry for the boys to have to grow up without jade but they have loads of reminders of her from all the TV stuff she has done and magazines that they can watch and read when they are older and will be able to see how much she loves them which alot of children who lose there parents at an early age don't have.|`|8FJUDaiVaa	i feel soo sorry for jade and her family. <br>  it must be so hard to know ur going to die, but even worse to know you will never see your kids grow up. <br>  <br>  I am sure her kids will be fine, they will have a good education, and the personality of jade :)|`|GaYPGIMNaa	I don't believe you like Jade and you ask these pointless questions which have nothing to do with RTV to attract the trolls out from under their stones to spew their poison.

I'm sure their  dad will bring them up as Jade would have wanted - they will be fine !|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Of course they will miss her Hotlips but she will be watching over them  after she has gone make no mistake about that.  She has given them a good grounding in life - lots of love etc. and they will have a good education thanks to the money in trust for them  and a proper childhood, something she never had.  Jeff seems quite level headed and I think he will raise them to be good decent lads bless them.
ciquDqIcaa	Hey! I've been learning piano and I am currently on grade 6 of the 8, in juts three years. I have done this with only using a piano for practice a few times a year - I have a small room so could only have a keyboard!<br>  <br>  The keyboard is smaller than the piano but to make up for this you can change octaves on a keyboard, so if the note you need to play is especially high or low you can edit the settings to make up for this.<br>  <br>  You can also use a different voice to add a feel to the piece, and this is a benefit of it :D<br>  <br>  You can buy a plug in pedal quite cheaply and this is not as good as the real thing but it gives you a feel for how the sustain and sostenuto pedals should sound. Of course a keyboard may also give these effects.<br>  <br>  You have to remember that a keyboard is basically an electronic piano. The keys are lighter so if you are going up for an exam you will need to have a few trial runs of your pieces on a real piano to get the feel for it. However, if you are teaching yourself you just need to be able to identify the notes - something you can do yourself on either a keyboard or piano!<br>  <br>  There is some excellent sheet music out there if you just google it and of course remember that you can get piano lessons and say you are practising on a piano and just use a keyboard. They are fine for learning the pieces, and when you go to play at wherever you are learning you will get the feel for it that way.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions I'll be happy to answer them for you, just send me a message :D|`|Jvk8RnL7aa	They do have keyboards out there that have pedals, although I'm not sure whether or not you can call it a keyboard. Otherwise i suggest looking at the nearest academic or recreational center. they're bound to have pianos either for free or for a fee|`|rPKEiwQcaa	go for it|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	To be a good pianist you must get a piano, it is totally different in touch than Keyboards, otherwise you'll lose your time.|`|YupMCYHlaa	You could practice with a keyboard and that would help.  But you can get keyboards with 'weighted' keys that feel more like a real piano.  This is important for playing the piano because you need to build up strength in your fingers.  Organs are actually much easier to play.  There are relatively cheap electronic 'pianos' with weighted keyboards that even come with pedals.<br>  <br>  But if you learned to play keyboard pretty well, you could 'transition' to a piano without much trouble, once you got a piano or reasonable electronic substitution.|`|83uzgBqTaa	the difference between a keyboard and a piano is the feel of piano and the sound. piano is obviously more natural and has a more real feel to it. the keyboard is more fake sounding of a piano but has the same physical features. you can learn how to play piano on a keyboard perfectly fine. the dynamics won't be the same but you'll still learn. My friend used play on a keyboard when he took piano lessons and now he's amazing at piano.<br>  <br>  if you wanna just learn how to play keyboard is fine but if your looking to learn the dynamics and feeling of playing the piano is the right way to go|`|64jTtN0jaa	You can buy a pedal for your keyboard. They cost around $20 and have a 1/4 inch jack that you plug into the back of your keyboard. If you can't afford a piano have you tried renting one? They rent pianos and digital pianos. But I really dislike keyboards because the keys are smaller in width than a real piano and they aren't properly weighted. With a real piano you have total control of how soft/hard you want to play to create different dynamics. I don't think keyboards can register that kinda stuff cause its basically 1 key gives 1 sound, and the only way you can control your dynamics is with the nifty volume knob :)! Plus keyboards totally suck in bringing out emotions in a piece... because again... the terrible sound.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	You can start out on a keyboard and just buy a sustain pedal for it.  Those are fairly inexpensive.  That being said, if you want to become very good at playing, you will eventually reach a point where you will need to purchase either a piano or at least a good digital one.  Otherwise, your development will be slowed significantly and you will develop bad habits.|`|xMnN99T8aa	Keyboard works OK. Some have pedals.

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A man traveling on a new modern plane was in urgent need of using<br>  the restroom. Each time he tried to use it, it was occupied.<br>  The flight attendant, aware of his predicament, suggested he use<br>  the ladies room but she cautioned him against pressing any of the<br>  buttons.<br>  The man agreed and rushed into the restroom to relieve himself.<br>  He noticed four buttons marked "WW", "WA", "PP" and "ATR". Making<br>  a fateful mistake many men make in disregarding what a woman<br>  says, the man allowed his curiosity to get the best of him and<br>  decided to try to the buttons anyway.<br>  He carefully pressed the first button, marked "WW", and<br>  immediately warm water sprayed his entire bottom.<br>  He thought," Golly, the gals really got it made".<br>  Still curious, he pressed the second button, marked "WA", and<br>  warm air dried his bottom off gently and quickly. He thought that<br>  was out of this world.<br>  The button marked "PP" caused a large powder puff to powder his<br>  bottom with a sweet smelling silky powder.<br>  Well naturally he couldn't resist pressing the last button marked<br>  "ATR".<br>  When he woke up in the hospital, he panicked and buzzed the<br>  nurse. When she appeared, he cried out,<br>  "What happened? The last thing I remember I was in the ladies<br>  room aboard a plane.<br>  The nurse replied "Yes, and you were having a great time until<br>  you pressed the "ATR" button"<br>  "What the hell does "ATR" stand for?" asked the man.<br>  "Automatic Tampon Remover. Your penis is under your pillow."|`|2GMdTj3aaa	You totally ruined the end with by titling this "Blonde Breathalizer Test."

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A man seeing flashing red and blue lights in his rear view mirror pulls to the side of the road.<br>  A minute or so after coming to a stop, a police officer approaches the car.<br>  The man says, "What's the problem officer?"<br>  Officer: "You were going 75 miles an hour in a 55 mile an hour zone. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ticket you."<br>  Man: No sir, I was going a little over 60.<br>  Wife: Oh, Harry. You were going at least 80! (The man gives wife dirty look.)<br>  Officer: I'm also going to give you a ticket for your broken tail light.<br>  Man: Broken tail light? I didn't know about a broken tail light!<br>  Wife: Oh Harry, you've known about that tail light for weeks! (The man gives his wife another a dirty look.)<br>  Officer: I'm also going to give you a citation for not wearing your seat belt.<br>  Man: Oh, I just took it off when you were walking up to the car.<br>  Wife: Oh, Harry, you never wear your seat belt!<br>  The Man turns to his wife and yells, "For cryin' out loud, can't you just shut up?!"<br>  The officer turns to the woman and asks, "Ma'am, Does your husband talk to you this way all the time?"<br>  Wife says, "No officer, Only when he's drunk."|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	funny one!!

tcFGLlS3aa	The Rain Song, by Led Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  Listen to it, its awesome.<br>  Its a good song for just chillin' to.|`|LkN5nr6faa	San Tropez by Pink Floyd is one of my favorites. I'll also add Over the Hills and Far Away by Led Zeppelin, which isn't fully acoustic, but Jimmy Page created one of the best acoustic riffs of all time as far as I'm concerned in that song.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Goodbye (I'm Sorry)- Jamestown Story.<br>  <br>  It's such an emotional song. It helped me get through a tough time in my life. It's like they were using reverse psychology when they wrote it. I love the line "No one will cry over me. I'm not worth any tears."<br>  It has to be my favorite song lyric :]|`|SIqFa1mzaa	Favorite: Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd<br>  <br>  It's hard to choose just one; I also like these:<br>  Layla (acoustic version also by Clapton)<br>  Mrs. Robinson by Simon and Garfunkel<br>  Wonderwall by Oasis|`|4Z0G5x52aa	"Hey There Delilah" - Plain White T's<br>  <br>  Go ahead everyone and make fun of me.

qHCtBq07aa	I am an all out Jillian/Black Team fan but I agree. <br>  But now that the Blue team has voted Dane off, their is no competition. <br>  I know that they are trying to play the game but that was a mistake that is going to cost them dearly. <br>  Ron needs to be sent home, he has been there long enough to know what to do at home but he needs other help, that the ranch cannot provide for him. He needs to take care of his knee and doing that at the ranch and loosing 5 pounds a week, isn't helping the Blue team any.|`|BZixouYIaa	i didn't want dane to leave|`|BJoojnQCaa	I was so pissed at the Blue Team. Ron really needs to go, he can't keep up. I am so tired of him begging to stay when he can't do what is required to stay. How does the Blue Team think they can win weigh ins when they voted off one of the people who loses the most each week. They are going down big time. <br>  <br>  I am all for the black team.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	Yes I was sad to see Dane go I really think that Ron should have gone home! Yeah he needs to loose weight and he says he needs to be there but he cant do all the things that everyone else is doing! Plus he is barely losing the weight! <br>  Dane looks good since he has gotten voted off he is doing great!|`|2nOC6OZHaa	I am -so- depressed that Dane went home. He can do it, but if they don't want to make themselves loose weigh ins, they needed to keep him and send Ron home.|`|RN7NzeCsaa	haven't seen it but you girls sure seem real sad!<br>  you ever need someone to talk to i'm right here lol|`|tVvQpftHaa	I was SUPER sorry to see Dane go.

I would say U2.|`|ExZ5tLF9aa	Neither really LOL but boyzone do it for me.......U2 are one of the most overrated bands in the music industry right now.|`|70j0Bmzdaa	the pogues<br>  and sorry bubbles but flogging molly are from L.A but they do rock|`|qBRF5YJeaa	Boyzone are better than U2!|`|tlj3c50Haa	Umm...

16rD9k32aa	I have an aunt and uncle who I despise.<br>  When my grandmother died, we were stationed in Hawaii with the USMC. We had spent the last of the savings flying Mom home a year before when Grandmother had a stroke. One of my uncles (a good one) went to Grandmother's house and took down a crystal chandelier and sold it, to get money for Mom to come home for the funeral. The bad uncle (a scum sucking, shyster lawyer) took Mom aside at the funeral and forced her to sign a contract stating that she would pay the estate back for the chandelier, with interest. AT THE FLIPPING FUNERAL!!!!!  He was just damned lucky that my Dad wasn't there. He would ripped his F-ing head off. <br>  Several years later, at the wedding of the good uncle's daughter, my aunt came up to me and said "Oh Sweetie, it's so nice to see you smiling for once." That was the first time I had seen her about 14 years! The last time was when I was 7 years old.

bankzwwYaa	actually.. only half a chicken...<br>  <br>  Those "tenders" are the innermost strip of meat that traverses the "ribs" you run across in a piece of fried chicken. Fist is the outer " shell" which comprises about 75% to 90% of the actual meat weight of a chicken breast...<br>  <br>  BUT... inside that "shield" tucked against the triangle shaped piece of cartiledge..is the "tender" part of the breast. That is what you see at the grocery stores are $5.00+ a pound...|`|AEmgc6IRaa	I'm sure it's chicken but they're probably using other parts of the chicken not just the ribs.|`|AA11939795	You have way too much time on your hands don't ya?!

KcHjIkQVaa	i think slash was amazing back in the day, AWESOME <br>  and ppl now dont know the difference between jonAss brothers and a band like GNR <br>  sadly !|`|2FIbamFgaa	I'd like to think so =)<br>  As you can see, I think Slash is freaking awesome.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree with you Leah, he IS over hyped.<br>  Mostly by guitar hero children.|`|AA11124885	I am a little old.  why do you say he is disliked as a person.  Who cares what some people think.  He rips it up on guitar.|`|O02cXOTTaa	no i think slash really inst very good.<br>  he is fine yes, great? no lol<br>  <br>  ive played the guitar, bass, drums, and been the vocalist in various bands for years and yearrrrss and i can tell you GN'R isnt a challange<br>  <br>  im not saying he doesnt have some talent at all, he just isnt amazing.<br>  like i just said in another Slash question, give anyone a big stack of amps and crank the distortion and they can sound like that too, its not difficult to do. i am seeing more and more kids however think that Slash is an absolute GOD because of Guitar Hero, and its getting prettty old|`|1vCoaf08aa	They see that GNR is overrated.<br>  <br>  Slash is good, but annoyingly over hyped.<br>  <br>  Lil Slash: That's right, guitar hero has ruined the names of countless musicians.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Actually it is the legion of unrelenting Slash Fangirls who keep trying to convince the world that he is the bestest ever that cause most people to be negative to Slach.<br>  <br>  The guy is a really goood player, great even (and sometimes people don't give pure Rock guitsrists enough credit, and that is what Slash is), but hee also is NOT the best ever.<br>  <br>  I love his solos.  I love his leads.  I liked Velvet Revolver too.  But I am also an unbiased realist.<br>  <br>  **Hey Warm Lettuce, before you show YOUR ignorance...why not go and play some of John Entwistle's Solos, or Cliff Burtons or Steve Harris' tripletts and see how "Easy" Bass is.<br>  <br>  Bashing someone for making an ignorant statement, then including one yourself doesn't help.  Especially since a lot of real MUSICIANS don't limit themsleves to a single instrument.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	Slash is a great guitarist, but one of the most overrated. Guitar Hero has sort of ruined his reputation. Still, GNR is one of my favorite bands.<br>  <br>  Edit: Bass is easy, you say? BASS? Is EASY? Where did you get that nugget of "information"? The Egotistical Garbage Guitarists of America Association? I don't play bass, but even I know it isn't a very easy instrument.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	I agree, he is an awesome guitarrist....yes, he had his crazy years, so what!? besides guitar he has a great style.<br>  <br>  ex: one of my friends hates GN′R just because he says slash sells drugs to little kidz.....I tell him he is clean now, but he is too stubborn to change his mind and admit his mistake....|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Slash isn't really that disliked compared to most rock stars.|`|FX2gTnORaa	hes pretty good but def not the best eva. he is a bit overrated

Immortality would be good IF there is more and more healthy living in society.|`|NOhaRLNFaa	The benefits of living forever are obvious. You get to see what happens in the future, you'd be famous for being the oldest person alive and living forever, and you'd never have to die, which is the one thing that nobody knows what it's like, because nobody can come back and tell us how it goes.<br>  On the other hand, you would have to see all your closest friends and family die while you go on living. Sure, you can make new friends and keep in touch with your descendants, but they'd eventually die, too. That's a lot of pain to go through. And if you're injured in what should be a fatal accident, you'd go through a lot of pain, then heal really slowly, just to possibly repeat the process. Also, your body would most likely continue aging, so you'd eventually be so decrepit that you couldn't even move, and you'd need help with everything you do. You'd eventually be so miserable with your failing body that you would WANT to die. Not to mention, I wouldn't want to be blasted off into outer space after some nuclear blast or when the sun turns into a red giant and engulfs half of the planets, especially if i needed help just to pee and roll over and eat.<br>  Just my thoughts...<br>  <br>  *smile4me* :)|`|mkshF2Pfaa	Most people are severely afraid of not existing anymore. That's one of the many reasons people latch on to religions; it grants them blissful immortality. I don't much have a preference either way, but there is something to be said for having a bit of extra time to accomplish what I'd like to...|`|Y63Q4bnOaa	Sometimes I think I'd like to live forever, because death is a scary thought.

I mean everyone always says no you wouldn't want to see all your friends and family dying and the world coming to an end. But to be frank, I am so scared of death I would rather go through that instead. Also if I knew I was gonna live forever then I would probably be a bit more carefree.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	Nah, i wanna see what else is out there after this world!|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	strange thing is ' i look forward to sleeping for ever .|`|067d68c8e201d0b655ca546bb8264fabaa	no, because all my family and friends would be gone & I couldn't deal with that|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	yes :)|`|eKOgRHa6aa	Yes :( But NO we die.

It is a ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Copper is rather supple in its pure state and (when fresh) has a pinkish or peachy color, which (besides gold) is unusual for metals, which are usually silvery or grayish. It is used as a thermal conductor, an electrical conductor, a building material, and a constituent of various metal alloys.<br>  <br>  Copper is an essential trace nutrient to all high plant and animal life. In animals, including humans, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a co-factor in various enzymes and in copper-based pigments. However, in sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous and even fatal to organisms.<br>  <br>  Copper has played a significant part in the history of mankind, which has used the easily accessible uncompounded metal for thousands of years. Evidence has been preserved from several early civilizations of the use of copper. In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, hence the origin of the name of the metal as Cyprium, "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to Cuprum.<br>  <br>  A number of countries, such as Chile and the United States, still have sizable reserves of the metal which are extracted through large open pit mines. However, like tin, there may be insufficient reserves to sustain current rates of consumption.[1] High demand relative to supply caused a price spike in the 2000s.[2]<br>  <br>  Copper has a significant presence in decorative art. It can also be used as an anti-germ surface that can add to the anti-bacterial and antimicrobial features of buildings such as hospitals.[3]

Z15TM1VQaa	Rurouni Kenshin<br>  Ten years after the start of the Meiji Era, a wanderer roams into Tokyo to find a new life with new friends. Vowing never to kill, he tries to escape his past as the Hitokiri Battousai, the greatest killer of the Bakumatsu. However, an old menace, in the form of Shishio Makoto, the successor to the Hitokiri Battousai, threatens the peace of the new Meiji Era. Shishio and his Juppon Gatana are ready to start a new revolution to correct the evils of Western influence.<br>  <br>  Hellsing<br>  In present day England, a war is being fought. The average citizen does not notice, but vampires are running rampant among the populace, and it's up to the Hellsing organization to contain the bloodsucker threat, using even their own weapons against them. Alucard, a vampire himself, is the best agent the organization has to offer, answering only to Integra Hellsing herself. No one knows much about this mysterious figure fighting against the occult, but things starts to change after he “recruits” a new agent to the establishment... <br>  <br>  Chrono Crusade<br>  It is the early 1920s, and New York City has a problem of evil proportions -- demons. With devil worshipping on the rise, foul spirits and monsters have begun to surface, causing fear and panic. Now, it is up to two members of Magdala Monastery's professional exorcist squad to help bring peace to the city, and destroy the demons with God's power (and bullets!). Join Chrno, a young demon, and Sister Rosette, his contractor, as they try to keep the city clean, while confronting the demons (no pun intended) of their past.<br>  <br>  Blood+<br>  In world where flesh-eating monsters roam the streets, only one organization has the means to save civilization from annihilation: Red Shield, a specially-organized unit designed to fight these monsters, and the only weapon that can destroy them: Saya. Awakened from a 30-year sleep, Saya is thrust into a modern world which she has no memories of, and is troubled by a past filled only with bloodshed and sadness. With the undying love and support of her family and friends, she struggles to gain the strength to move forward and regain the pieces of her shattered memories.<br>  <br>  Elfen Lied<br>  For Kouta and Yuka, finding the bloody naked young girl on the beach would change their lives forever, for better or for worse. Unable to speak or function as a normal human being, she is named Nyuu by the duo, and taken into their home in an effort to save her. But what neither teenager knows is that this innocent young girl is actually a killing machine -- an experiment gone terribly wrong -- and it is only a matter of time before the murderer in her awakens again...<br>  <br>  Devil May Cry<br>  Dante works as a demon hunter for the office of Devil May Cry, and as he is always in debt he doesn't have the luxury to turn down jobs as long as they pay well. His latest assignment is to be a bodyguard for the young Patty Lowe while she receives her inheritance. During the mission he was able to defeat the demons that got in his way and deliver Patty safely, but upon completion of the mission Dante discovers that Patty will be staying with him – indefinitely! Now, Dante must not only hunt demons and coexist peacefully with other hunters, but also handle the responsibility of taking care of a little girl! <br>  <br>  Claymore<br>  In times of olde, humans live in constant fear of demons known as yoma. These vicious creatures can take the appearance and memories of humans they have devoured, thus blending into society as they freely feast on human flesh. The key to stopping the yoma lies with the tolerated yet feared Claymores - women who are half-demon, half-human, and fully fated to become the demons that they hunt. Meanwhile, in a village, the young Raki has been banished; his only crime was losing his family to the yoma. Raki is drawn to a Claymore named Clare, and together their journey begins. While Clare fights the yoma plaguing the land, can Raki help her in her struggle to retain her humanity?<br>  <br>  Yu Yu Hakusho<br>  Yusuke Urameshi is a street fighter with a tough guy approach to everything, but no one ever expected a sudden act of heroism on his part: dieing, from trying to save a little boy from a speeding car. When he arrived in the afterlife, he is informed that no one was expecting him to die that way, and were not prepared for his arrival. Yusuke is eventually revived, and is assigned to work for the Spirit Realm as a Spirit Detective in the human world. No one knows what this idiot will do but most times it seems like he ends up winning just by a little luck (or a cheap shot).|`|05mJnGdmaa	try hellsing a sorta gunslinger anime

JH8Afnf4aa	Yes. I think that abortions are just as bad as murdering children but it's legal. Although, if the person is disabled and will not SURVIVE through the pregnancy then I think that that's fine.<br>  <br>  Every woman has a choice whether I agree with it or not.|`|mns5yLmRaa	I don't thumbs down answer one - I give them a thumbs up actually.<br>  <br>  If you were raped, would you want to be constantly reminded of that?? I most certainly wouldn't want to be reminded every single day of the day I was raped... I mean, it's something you would NEVER EVER forget of course. I know it's not the childs fault you were raped but personally I wouldn't keep it.<br>  <br>  But, if it was your own stupid fault for not using protection, then yes, I agree that it's murder and very wrong.

It's wrong that pro-lifers are vehemently for capital punishment.|`|BIqXrr9kaa	well yeah murder is wrong right...and abortion is murder no matter how you look at it...its taking the life of someone....and thats wrong|`|568ac9941468bad6571c214f5eba0fa7aa	no...if you know you can't take care of the baby, then why keep it?|`|KXs6Y0APaa	I think it is okay if the fetus is under 4 months and doesn't have hair or nails.|`|v8ZQjYQ5aa	Yes, because even a mother doesn't have the right to kill her own child. Just because the child is 'unborn' i.e. not outside of the mother's womb does not make it not a living human being. Since when does not being 'outside' of the mother make a baby not alive?? It's alive and thriving and growing off the mother before it is born, so it should be treated just as a human being who has already been born. People who agree with abortions and killing their unborn children are no better than murderers. <br>  <br>  And for those people who say that a girl who finds out she is pregnant should be able to abort the child because she can't take it of it.. Well she shouldn't have slept with a guy and had her fun like that if she wasn't prepared for the consequences of her actions! It's called taking responsibility for what you do. Killing another being doesn't justify ones own inability to take responsibility for ones actions. <br>  And even if a girl was raped and got pregnant as a result, she still doesn't have the right to kill another human being just because she doesn't want to be 'reminded' of what happened to her. Give the baby up for adoption or something, but don't kill it. Murdering an innocent baby is no better than rape. <br>  <br>  help w/ my q pls! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226150905AAKHfAe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|og6BDTISaa	i think they're necessary in some cases like if a teenager is pregnant. cuz most times the teen cant handle the baby and the baby and the teen suffer. but in other cases like when they just dont want to have the baby i think its wrong and horrible. it's like killing someone.|`|kH2ZLnnuaa	All murder is wrong.|`|eFo0Zih6aa	it depends on the reason for the abortion...|`|ok4DPpHlaa	nope=]|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes i do, its just like killing someone, thats my opinion anyway!!!!!!!!!!!|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	yes,its evil.  people that would have an abortion wouldnt let you kill a convicted murderer<br>  who could kill a baby?|`|NxAFTzsYaa	No, I don't think abortions are wrong.

Xpiflt1Kaa	You know to be honest I think it is totally the medias fault. OK yes it is there job to broadcast and give us info and the goss on celebs but they over dramatise every thing. I mean why should they have any right to criticise others, famous or not. Thats like someone you know telling their friend your sister looks fat. <br>  And yes we all have bitching sessions but it is as if they purpously go out of their way to make the celebs feel bad. And to make it fifty times worse we teenage girls especially look up to the various celebrities like Mischa, Paris and Nicole. We see them under pressure from the media to lose weight and we instantly want to look like them.<br>  <br>  I don't know what it is but we want to be them even when they look like stick insects. In my opinion it is the media trying to sell their magazines etc by making catchy slogans that happen to be really unfair and hurtful. <br>  Yeah so thats my opinion!

6fvR8J9Kaa	1.you are definitely not a wimp or gay<br>  2. i think it is really sweet, i like it when guys show that they have emotions and there is nothing wrong about it, a lot of people do it including me -  i get tears in my eyes whenever i hear a song that reminds me of something or someone.<br>  <br>  also that song that makes you cry is very emotional so no wonder it makes you upset, it makes me sad too<br>  <br>  im really sorry that your nana died (may her soul rest in peace) and its only been a year so your still upset....<br>  <br>  (i never really had a nan... my mum's mum died before i was born and my dad's mum died a few years ago as well as my grandad so i know how you feel)|`|2k8TEiRtaa	No, it's not gay or wimpy. it is your expression of grief. it is sweet. It shows you really loved your Nana. Sorry for your grief.|`|v811KD7raa	i dont like the song but theres nothing wrong with feeling tearful about your nan<br>  <br>  one time i was pouring a cup of tea and for some random reason it reminded me of my nan pouring tea in her kitchen and i felt a bit teary.  feeling teary about important people who have passed away is a healthy sign - youd be weird if you didnt feel teary about them|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	it is understanable that you will be crying. my great grapm died just over 2 years ago and i still cry alot as io miss him so dw it is normal and i am here for you if you need me|`|48E8gRHAaa	no i don't think so. it shows u have an emotional side and i find that sweet =]<br>  btw sorry for ur loss <3|`|RcBkUBsfaa	sorry for your loss..|`|olcqtrqsaa	I sorry to hear of your lose.I don't think your a wimp it is a natural process when it's someone close to you.<br>  I was close to my godmother and the song they brought her coffin in to the church with was played at her wedding when she walk down the isle although I was only 5 at her wedding I can still remember the song a whiter shade of pale by procol harum.She died 15yrs ago now but that song still makes me cry(an I a 43yr old Bloke)<br>  As time goes by you will find it easier to deal with.|`|JwNBbXMDaa	sorry for ur loss and i think its sweet
I0waERKqaa	OMG, GIRLFRIEND!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm a Cancer and I LOOOVE Capricorn men. <br>  <br>  But....<br>  <br>  <br>  They are dangerous for you, however. <br>  <br>  You see Capricorn is one of the most difficult, and hard to get to, sign in the zodiac, and you being a Cancer your like the most Loving and vulnerable sign in the whole zodiac. <br>  <br>  The attraction is strong, but he may consider you weak. <br>  <br>  There is a great dynamic, however, because Capricorn is masculine and represents the father figure, and work, and Cancer is ultra Femminin and represents the Mother figure and home. <br>  <br>  totally sexy, awesome, erotic attraction, perfect.<br>   <br>  <br>  However, inevitably, they will hurt you, and they are better off alone, really. <br>  They get along with Sagitarius better, and Taurus, is a rocky relationship, but cancer, is a strong SEXUAL attraction, because you guys are opposites on the zodiac wheel, so hey. <br>  <br>  I had a daughter with a Capricorn man, who screwed me over, but the sex was awesome!!!<br>  <br>  Capricorn is arrogant and shallow, but a strong sign. They don't get along with anybody, they think they are too D#$% good, to be frank.<br>  They have the hardest lives and they are very serious, and disciplined.<br>   I have total respect and admiration for them, and how hard they work. It's not easy being depressed constantly, and that's how they are. <br>  <br>  You see they are not very sympathetic. They are kinda cold, and they restrict themselves and their emotions. undoubtedly from a difficult childhood.<br>  <br>  Cancer is nurturing, and loving, and the dams of their emotions are NOT RESTRICTED at all. They have no problem Loving and expressing Love, however Capricorn, DOES. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm consistently meeting Capricorns and am drawn to them in spite of myself.<br>  Now that I don't want anything to do with them, and I've been there, done that, I still, annoyingly end up attracting to one or other <br>  <br>  so go figure!!<br>  <br>  They can make great parents, by the way.|`|e4cZQ367aa	big time,i love capricorn men!<br>  <br>  good team<br>  <br>  cancer :)|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Yes going off sun signs this is considered a good match. Cancer and Capricorn fall in each others house of marriage. They are also seen as the parents of the zodiac. Cancers are the fathers (yes that's right the FATHERS) of the Zodiac and Capricorn is seen as the mothers. <br>  Most people would think its the other way around, but I have sources that say otherwise. <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, yes this is a good match just going off sun signs. As far as parenting skills that's really up to the individual, I know some terrible Cancer parents and I know some wonderful ones too it just depends.

q4XUy0Duaa	Lil Wayne doesn't deserve his own genre.  His music still falls under the category of rap.  He is a below average rapper at best, and he doesn't even write his own lyrics.  I'm an oldhead, and I've seen all of these little teenage girls go crazy over artists just like Wayne and then forget about him a year later.  Trust me, this won't last long.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	NO MATTER what you say, Wayne is whack|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Yes, he is sick. You call it "different." I call it "mentally challenged."|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I decided to not say anything bad about Wayne anymore, i find it to be a weak demonstration of my character... Wayne's verse on Wyclef's song "Sweetest Girl" is not bad.

He is in it for the dinero and not the music.|`|LyauFqaaaa	teenie boppers and media can do wonders for some artists. lil wayne is a pure example. any male that is over 16 listening to wayne must have special needs.|`|oVDjMzlMaa	UH.........................................

He does have good songs...it's just that nowadays he changed a lot and the sizzurp got to him. lol. I don't see why people say he's the worst rapper alive, that's doing to much. Soulja boy is wack though, there's no doubt about that. It's like everybody hears the commercial side of Lil Wayne and judge him from songs on the radio. Songs like Pxssy Money Weed, I'm Me, I Feel Like Dying, and many other ones show that he is far from a wack rapper. His old music is better though. Just kuz he's doing something different doesn't mean he's wack..And I don't think he's the best rapper. But that's just what I think...

Not all theaters in my area have matinee pricing though.  Some theaters have student discounts (w/ a student ID of course).

Eventually there will be one.  Most likely it's 3 years away at a minimum.|`|BJIo6twUaa	Last i read about it, its on hold due to money issues.<br>  <br>  BSDNC - I dont think that is a real official video because it list names of people that voiced the game and from what i can see on the internet, the one person i looked up, never acted in any live action movies/tv shows. It was all voice.

tlj3c50Haa	Erm yes. Very. Well, in England anyway. About a year ago they were on the radio and TV ALL the time, in shops on those music things, and nearly everyone had them on their iPod/phone. <br>  It was really annoying for me, because I don't like them. Lol. But it's good to find someone who isn't going to go "what, they're mainstream now?! I hate them!" :)|`|hkzGYQD4aa	I've heard of them, but I don't think I would call them mainstream.<br>  <br>  =]|`|NC67WVlEaa	I think they may be considered more mainstream in England than the states.

uctxzjIIaa	We've seen characters have multiple variations to their bankai (like Byakuya's millions of flower petals [amped up shikai] as well as the 1,000 blades dome), so I see no reason why Ichigo couldn't have something like that as well. However, it seems unlikely that he'd pull it off now for three reasons:<br>  1) He's not a strategist or tactician. When he fights, he does so by just going full bore straight ahead.<br>  2) Bankai is still extremely new to him, so he probably doesn't have the skill to start messing with it.<br>  3) The concept of his bankai doesn't really lend itself to much of anything else except being able to move so fast it apears there are multiple copies of himself, which is just too derivative of Shadow Clone Jutsu for Kubo to write in.|`|C8u2jBu7aa	Honestly i don't know. I don't think so. After all, the vaizard are shinigami who have gained the abilities of hollow. Perhaps, Ichigo will learn to use Cero and add it to Getsuga Tenshou for some ultra-kill stuff.|`|0g2fDpUbaa	Bankai is the last release.  I suspect what will happen is Ichigo will find out how to push his power even more than it is now.  If you remember in the past, his soul power was called relatively limitless and it just seemed he was not able to use all of it.  It seemed to ramp up based on the threat level faced, thus he was able to defeat Kenpachi with just his Bankai form while Kenpachi can defeat the vasto lords that Ichigo was having problems with.  What may happen is that Ichigo figures out that his form is simply a shape for his spirit powers and therefore, as long as he has not exhausted his spirit powers, he really cannot be hurt.<br>  If you notice, Ichigo still doesn't use the ability to use the sword's chain to magnify the attacks like his dark side can.  There are still techniques that he has not trained himself to use that may appear.|`|SB4N01OOaa	I think Hichigo's either gonna come out, or Ichigo is going to discover some special Vaizard power. Back when Shinji was fighting Grimmjow, wasn't he about to release something like a cero? Theoretically, if he can do that, Ichigo should be able to also.|`|SZUzatcJaa	Nope. Whats gonna happen is right when ichigo is getting his butt kicked ichigo is gonna have a life changing moment like always and start to fight back two times harder and then bam three weeks later ichigo will finally kill him.|`|A57lGcQ1aa	nope

GomZ9oYHaa	NO|`|C1y4sOfFaa	No, she shouldn't. Nadya Suleman is an irrational, egocentric woman and a burden to both taxpayers and the media (She sees them as her meal ticket). All of her children should be placed in foster care.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	No...Hope she goes to a woman's shelter and gets therapy before her mother turns her back on her...If she doesn't get help, I hope DSS or the Feds get involved and put her a*s in place...Its called Tax Fraud...or Defrauding the Government...<br>  <br>  Suleman is either a complete moron or a selfish little b*tch...I'm thinking both...She is an attention-starved idiot who obviously is milking the system and the media by having so many kids KNOWING FULL WELL she can't AFFORD them...<br>  <br>  The sad thing is I heard, according to her attorney, that her website has generated $2-$3 Million from people wanting to help her...I'd like to know who the heck is supporting her...Those people should be locked up with her...|`|kg6H6HDuaa	No I don't think she should keep them not only because I am a taxpayer but because they deserve a loving family who has the means to take care of them not just someone milking the system.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	I would rather her keep them than have them separated and go to homes that only god knows would be good ones. <br>  <br>  Either way, were paying for them so it really doesn't matter.|`|TLNQZ63baa	Okay is the question do we think she SHOULD keep her kids?  Or are you asking if she WILL keep her kids?  You did not specify.<br>  <br>  Should?  Perhaps... yes<br>  Will?  Perhaps, no.|`|urmhRHwxaa	No.  <br>  <br>  1) She does not have the financial means to support the children.  Although she has been offered money and babysitting services by several charitable organizations, are they still going to be volunteering to watch the kids when they are, say, seven or eight years old?  Even though Suleman claims she is going to get her Master's degree, her salary will not be ample enough to support these children on her own.<br>  <br>  2) She obviously has mental issues.  Not only is she obsessed with having as many children as possible with little regard to her health (or the children's), her financial situation, or the future, but there is also evidence that she has an unhealthy fixation on actress Angelina Jolie, including using her benefit money for plastic surgery and/or filling agents such as collagen or Restylane.  The difference is that Jolie is a millionaire movie star paired with another star of equal or greater fame and riches; hence, they can afford a large family.<br>  <br>  3) It's obvious that she is cynically using the public's emotional attachment to any newborn for her own hunger for money and publicity.  She has established a website asking people for donations for the children (the website does not mention her previous six children), going so far as to accept major credit cards.  She also encouraged a bidding war with the networks before giving interviews to the press.  She is obviously a lonely, mentally disturbed woman who will stop at nothing to become, at least temporarily, famous.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i know c.p.s. won't do sh@t. so sadly for those kids yes.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Absolutely not , did you hear she is going to do a porno movie for a million dollars ?|`|RkNIs0rSaa	Yes,  either way we are gonna pay to raise them though|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	sadly yes|`|CApnEZ83aa	Yes.|`|j4PwaY5Jaa	wow only one other girl answered with a yes or no lol <br>  <br>  <br>  yes

Vd92Vlsfaa	It was because they wanted to air the show with their new sci-fi show "Dollhouse" which began on Friday 12 February.  Fridays are a weak night for American television networks.  They wanted to put their sci-fi action programming to try and get viewers so they put "Dollhouse" and "TSCC" together.<br>  <br>  PS: TSCC is likely to be cancelled after it's second season due to very low ratings.|`|AA11404443	I'm not sure but my best guess would be because the network did not order as many shows for an average season. I believe they cut the number they ordered so to fill up the whole season they stretched it with a big gap in the middle.  Hopefully they will get more viewers on Friday night so they are not canceled next season.|`|964c75addb18800c47dcf2ebe39d4d2faa	They started to air The Sarah Connor Chronicles with Dollhouse which is more than likely the reason for the break.  I love The Sarah Connor Chronicles too.  I'm hoping it doesn't get canceled; that would suck.|`|5RF3qNByaa	:)|`|ba52jQHyaa	Because Fox does a terrible job with their programing. Some times it seams like they are trying to loose viewers. IMHO
4zscfvvoaa	I hope that your brothers band is a self contained unit.  There will be no PA, no equipment on site.  The amp heads, run the amps.  It is like the power horse to the speakers.

One of the girl finds out she is being talked about and goes crazy on one of the other girls... the girl she has gone crazy on tells her tht it wasnt just "me" she talked about you to so on so on... ... than everyone goes crazy on eachother and theres one girl pulling one girls hair the other girl crying running the opposite direction on the sandy beach... one girl taking pictures... one girl fishing for dinner and the others are laying out for a nice tan.......

When the network brought back Family Guy the episode was scrapped because they thought the character would be easier to write for if they just left it up in the air.  After all, they figured ,he's only a one year old anyway.  He was bowled over by the Swanson's baby girl *but by the end of the episode he said he was over her and in love with Brian Adams.  The next new episode is called "Family Gay" but it's about Peter turning gay after a medical experiment.

EPaYoJaiaa	they're not ridiculing his music the days when he was amazing and the King of Pop. They're ridiculing the pedophile plastic crazy alienish thing that he's become. There's a difference.<br>  Yes his songs WERE amazing but what has he come out with recently? besides his #1's album and court dates? nothin. Sometimes I feel bad for Michael, he didn't have a great childhood, but then I feel disgusted there's a point where his actions stop being blamed on his bad childhood and start being blamed on him. Plus with the exception of Latoya Jackson I don't see any of his other siblings going nutzo. I could be wrong. <br>  That being said NOBODY should be ridiculed whether he's the former King of Pop or some bum on the street. Instead he should be held accountable for his actions and that's it.|`|SEzMrFrbaa	i love his songs and himself 2 and im 22|`|YhuH2k4Caa	you dont get much respect if you look like some ghoulish creature that fancies little boys and dangle your baby out of a hotel window.......that is inexcusable behavior if you ask me. lol he isnt the king of pop anymore...hes the king of creepiness.|`|ee5MawLdaa	His songs might be great and all but is he a great person??? heck no!!

Y1aAGPURaa	That was Hilarious!!!    Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  One day a little boy woke up and sat down at the table expecting breakfast. However, his mother says, "You don't get any breakfast until you do your chores."<br>  <br>  A little pissed off, the boy goes out to do his chores. When he goes to milk the cow, he kicks it. When he goes to get eggs he kicks a chicken, and when he goes to feed the pigs, he kicks a pig.<br>  <br>  When the little boy sits down his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal. "Where is the bacon, eggs and milk?" asks the little boy. His mother replies, "I saw you kick the cow, so you don't get any milk; I saw you kick a chicken so you don't get eggs; and I saw you kick a pig so you don't get any bacon!"<br>  <br>  Just as she finishes saying this, the boy's father comes down the stairs and kicks the cat. The little boy looks up at his mother and asks, "Do you want to tell him, or should I?"|`|fAA3rjTbaa	HAHA|`|TjWA37kuaa	hahaha|`|g2CZi00Uaa	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL what an idiot haha xD|`|YOfRm3U5aa	THAT IS SOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ocw4wxlmaa	lmao that's hilarious!|`|qlRivgdnaa	I love this joke!

yB3Jek85aa	One of the worst child abuse cases in California's history came to an end on March 5, 1973 when Dave Pelzer entered foster care. Dave begins his incredible story as an abused child with his rescue in part one of a series, A Child Called "It". Calling this book a "page turner" doesn't give it justice. Easy to read, but difficult to comprehend how any mother could treat her child this way.<br>  Horrific Abuse <br>  Besides being horribly beaten, Dave was forced to eat his own vomit, swallow soap, ammonia, and Clorox. This was just the beginning of his mother's "games." Dave's childhood wasn't always a nightmare. There were the "good years" in the beginning and Dave devotes a chapter describing the feelings of warmth and safety provided by his mother. By the age of 4 these feelings were replaced with fear, starvation and lowliness.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	twilight series|`|t9H3fQPoaa	Terry Pratchett books are great,<br>  im not a big reader but they always have me hooked.|`|9fe2ad1e4012b0da774059d5d7c39405aa	thomas the tank engine|`|AV1AnRxkaa	Try the Twilight Saga.<br>  The books are:<br>  Twilight <br>  New Moon<br>  Eclipse<br>  Breaking Dawn|`|VTSwvtJOaa	Try For Whom the Bell Tolls by ernest hemingway

And its discovery may mean the end of all humanity. When a terrorist bomb destroys a building in Dallas, Texas, FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy surpassing anything they've ever encountered. With the dubious assistance of a paranoid doctor, Mulder and Scully risk their careers and their lives to hunt down a deadly virus which may be extraterrestrial in origin - and could destroy all life on earth. Their pursuit of the truth pits them against the mysterious Syndicate, powerful men who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe, leading the agents from a cave in Texas, to the halls of the FBI, and finally to a secret installation in Antarctica which holds the greatest secret of all.|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	Maybe the X-Files movie?|`|e0Zdjrgwaa	I don't know the movie, However if you would like to check this website out they have almost every movie, T.V show<br>   and music that you can download.<br>  <br>  <br>   Good luck!

I don't think they exist as a band anymore, but one of their albums ( and I think it might be the only one) is self titled and probably available somewhere.

cVbpywZpaa	i  thought it was ok, but it aint on a par with all the horror greats like the shining, halloween, etc, i think a movie can deliver real shock value but not if it rams it down your throat, i found the directors blatent attempts to shock childish and the animal cruelty was totally uncalled for, i mean i have nothing against grotesque movies but not if the whole point of the movie  is how disgusting can we be.|`|tLI94qWNaa	The animal slaughterings in the movie were real!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  I am a big animal lover so of course I think that movie is terrible.  This movie has gained the title of the most notorious movie of all-time, and is often claimed to be banned in over 50 countries worldwide. If true, it would easily hold the world record for the most heavily banned film. <br>  <br>  It is famous because of the time it came out in and just the horror that is in this movie.  He was very twisted.  I like twisted but when animals are involved that is when I draw the line.|`|waGFlfRUaa	Well, I just saw "Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals" and Laura Gemser was hot in that movie and I just received  'Mountain of the Cannibal God" and "Jungle Holocaust". I have "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Cannibal Holocaust: The Beginning" (remake of Cannibal Holocaust) on order... <br>  <br>  These films were shocking during the 1970's, and many were and some are still banned in some countries. Many were so heavily edited, as well, and have only in the past few years been released on DVD in various uncut/restored versions... But only in limited releases... But, compared to todays films like "SAW" and "Hostel", the 1970's films are pretty tame...|`|3cGgRo42aa	I absolutely despised it. The gore was so real (which was a plus) but than I found that they DID use real animals for some of the killing scenes and I was absolutely disgusted. The rape scenes did no good for me either. And I agree w/ you, psychological horror movies are more of my preference.|`|stWGfFeTaa	i never heard of that movie but, i agree most "influential and inspirational" films , are just over rated, ur probably right about the graphicness being ledgendary|`|852aaa8d960b3819716c4ab3df937afaaa	I saw this on some "Most Disturbed" list and decided to watch it along with some others such as Irreversible and The Audition.  The dead turtle scene made my heart drop into my stomach.  It was so unnecessary and awful.  I mean, did they really need to kill all those animals?  I know that animals die everyday in the wild but not for some film that needs to fulfill some director's God complex so he can be considered "creative".  It was such a graphic movie, and I agree the rape was too much, it looked real as well.  Maybe there are worse, more gruesome films out there but this one was ahead of its time and not in a good way.  I honestly can't believe I watched it until the very end, I guess my human curiosity kicked in.

QkhUkd97aa	yes, he, unlike much of the "talent" (a word i use begrudgingly) of today, actually has some. His vocal range expands beyond three notes and i for one applaud him. The music they play is also deep with a lot of passion, not merely a poppy mess strewn together to amuse fans. The last statement being a direct attack on any and all fans of the jonas's, the untalented spawn of billy ray, and that god awful disasterpeice known as high school musical. Their music takes me back to an era of music that i am frankly too young to remember, but cherish none the less.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	It's tough to say exactly. I'm on a good shuffle run in itunes at the moment so I'm going to pass on the clips, hope you don't mind, but I've heard 2 songs and the vocals were very different stylistically. One of them was All Sparks which I thought was great and I thought his vocal style was a big part of it. The other tune I heard had a more generic sort of euro modern alt rock style that I wasn't so taken with (sorry, can't remember the name, but it reminded me of Bloc Party or something like that). Either way he's definitely talented, and if he sings like he does on All Sparks more frequently then I dig it.|`|ExZ5tLF9aa	I think he's an untalented ****

E2VUH8Q0aa	No offense, but I know they're not all like that. I've been married to a randy Cap for 10 years and he can be a jerk, totally self serving and a jackass, but he's not dumb enough to give up someone who treats him good...but I I'm sorry you got an asshole. <br>  <br>  You deserve better. And he's really going kick himself in the *** when he realizes how good you were and what he lost. And he will. And you'll be with someone who's treating you right. Because good women don't stay lonely long. <br>  <br>  Bad Caps are users. It's the bad side of practical...how to use what you've got when you've got it...unfortunately he took that to mean the people who loved him, too. But Saturn rules KARMA and Capricorn...Saturn doesn't let Caps off easy, so don't think for a second the universe isn't going to make him pay for it. <br>  <br>  You go off and be happy. You don't need that crap.|`|AA10976951	It's amazing that you are not willing to believe that this is a trait of all African American men but you are willing to believe that it is a trait of all Capricorn men...odd don't ya think?|`|C27AHHoiaa	i think they all are like that.<br>  My mom was telling me about her new boyfriend. how weird n different he is,  and i ask her what sign he is. she said cap.<br>  =/|`|mAzgILpfaa	cap has a whole lot to offer if they see ur worth their while.

It doesn't matter who you think you are and what you're capable of JUST because you're so proud of indicating "Scorpio" at the bottom of every one of your ridiculously ignorant answers. Hope you got the message.<br>  ------------------<br>  <br>  I know how you feel. And I'm pretty sure, having been through something similar, that the only way you'll forget about it and move on with your life is if you simply meet someone new and accomplish something for yourself. Cap men are indeed selfish, and they can MAKE you believe that they're loyal and solid and all that stuff, but the reasons for being that way is usually for THEIR ultimate benefit, IF it's not because they actually love you. But seriously, he's not worth your heartache, simply. Go out and accomplish something you've been eyeing to accomplish for a long time and make yourself feel good.<br>  And when the time is right of course, you get your revenge.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and You Can Get Over It!!

1lh7oQsPaa	With a good instructor, your voice should improve after just a few weeks, if you practice & concentrate on technique.  I'd suggest starting with at least six weeks, though, if you'veneve rhad lessons before.  That shoud give you all the basics to help you practice without ruining your voice.<br>  <br>  When you'll be GOOD depends on where you are now, your goals, and what you define as good. <br>  <br>  Most of the singers I know (including me) never reach a point where they feel they can do everything they'd like to do with their voice.   We all have good qualities & most of us have some things we don't like, even after a lot of training.  With experience, you learn to find songs that complement your best qualities & you learn to work around your weaknesses.  That process goes on for the rest of your life, as far as I can tell.  I've been singing a lot of years & I'm still learning.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Yes you need the rights to screen the film and what is more you need a license to screen a film period. The film is not public domain. You need the production company's release to show the film and what is more you are liable if anyone who watches the film complains that it abused them in any way. I knew some people who tried to watch movies they purchased on a small network of their own but news of this got out and the screenings were stopped because they had no license to show movies and someone complained that some of the films were offensive. The same could happen to you. Try asking the production company for a release to show the film as an educational presentation and it should be okayed. Of course, you will have yet another problem, the school board has to approve your screening as well.|`|DEK6CQQQaa	Like a theater screening or DVD?

Klb4ZYcVaa	There were so many negative stuff about the movie, YOU be the judge. RACISM. IGNORANCE. <br>  <br>  The only positive thing about the movie is that everyone got what they needed in the end. Sandra Bullock's character fell down the stairs, looks as if she was paralyzed. Matt Dillon's character saved the lady he molested under a burning flipped car. Ludacris' character saved the Asians apparently gang asians bought for slavery. The only bad thing in the end was they found that guy dead. But watch the movie yourself.|`|FJ1cVfVRaa	I guess my take on it was that not ANYONE is completely bad or completely good. Ryan Phillipe's character, for example, was supposed to be good per say. He shot and killed the other kid though because he assumed he was pulling a gun on him. Matt Dillion's character is supposed to be bad per say, but he risks his own life to save a woman who he couldn't even show basic respect for the day before and so on and so forth.|`|hfRREP5Caa	im gonna try and help you out here. I think your teachers means how do everyone in that movie clash with each other negativly and positivly. some scenes made sense, but when u seen another scene that had an effect on the previous one, you were probably like whoa. so im thinking the questions is how did each character in each scene compliment another character and scene negativily and positivily.<br> <br> I might be wrong but hopefully this helped :)
4zscfvvoaa	It greatly depends on the type of music you play or want to play.  If you want to play acoustical pieces, an electric acoustic (or pre-amped) is a good way to go.  If you are real serious about the acoustic and want a really good one, you can always put a pick up into an acoustic.  This is an older style thing though.  Acoustics can always be mic-ed as well.<br>  <br>  Don't focus on what is the best purchase.  Focus on what is best for you to play.  What do you want to play?  Where will you be playing?  If you want to play for people through an amp, you can do so with a pre-amped acoustic very easy.  An electric will give you a world of sound options.  You can purchase effect pedals later, and play with distortion.<br>  <br>  Different sounds.  Buy a guitar that suits what you play.  The best all around option is the pre-amped acoustic, but limits you from playing quite a few things.

Here is his file (according to Starfleet records) on <a href="http://www.startrek.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.startrek.com</a><br>  <br>  Spock<br>  Played by Leonard Nimoy<br>  Episode: TOS 034 - Amok Time<br>  <br>  Starfleet Career Summary <br>  2252 – As cadet, assigned under Capt. Christopher Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise <br>  <br>  2253 – Commissioned as ensign, still aboard Enterprise under Pike <br>  <br>  2265 – As lieutenant commander, named first officer and science officer under Capt. James T.

Enterprise to Kirk for rescue of Project Genesis team <br>  <br>  2286 – Though uncharged, stands with Kirk and shipmates for theft of Enterprise charges <br>  <br>  2287 – Accompanies Kirk aboard U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-A for Nimbus III mission <br>  <br>  2293 – Envoy to UFP-Klingon peace accords, spurred by explosion of Klingon moon Praxis <br>  <br>  Spock's mother, Amanda Grayson, was a human schoolteacher from Earth and his father, Sarek, was a respected diplomat. For most of his life, Spock was torn between his emotional human side and the stern discipline of his Vulcan half until his experience with the V'Ger machine-entity in 2271 and his later death and rebirth in 2286 broadened his perspective. As of 2267 he had earned the Vulcanian Scientific Legion of Honor, had been twice decorated by Starfleet Command and held an A7 computer expert classification. <br>  <br>  As a child, Spock had a pet sehlat, which is a cuddly Vulcan bear-like animal with claws and fangs. His older half-brother, Sybok, who was ostracized from Vulcan because he rejected the way of pure logic, was killed in 2292 after battling an alien entity at the galaxy's center that claimed to be 'God.' <br>  <br>  At age seven, Spock was telepathically bonded with a young Vulcan girl named T'Pring. The telepathic touch would draw the two together when the time was right after both came of age: once every 7 years all Vulcan males experiences pon farr, a powerful Vulcan mating drive which demands that they mate or die. In 2267, however, T'Pring chose Stonn, a Vulcan, over Spock, and the Vulcan returned to the U.S.S. Enterprise unwed. He did eventually marry in a ceremony attended by Lt. Jean-Luc Picard. <br>  <br>  Because the young Vulcan chose to join Starfleet, he and Sarek opened an 18-year rift over Sarek's hope his son would attend the Vulcan Science Academy. Spock was the first Vulcan to enlist in the Federation Starfleet, serving aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise under Captain Christopher Pike as a lieutenant, and later for James T. Kirk. <br>  <br>  After the conclusion of the U.S.S. Enterprise's five-year mission, Spock retired from Starfleet and returned to Vulcan to pursue the emotion-purging of the kohlinar discipline from the Vulcan Masters. Although he completed the training, Spock failed to achieve kohlinar because his emotions were stirred by the V'Ger entity in 2271. He then reentered Starfleet and was eventually promoted to U.S.S. Enterprise captain when that ship was assigned as a training vessel at Starfleet Academy. <br>  <br>  Spock sacrificed himself in 2285 to repair plasma conduits that allowed the U.S.S. Enterprise and its crew to escape from the detonation of the Genesis Device by Khan Noonien Singh; his radiation-wracked body was consigned to space but landed on the newly formed Genesis Planet and began regeneration. Prior to his death, Spock had mind-melded with McCoy to transfer his katra, apparently intending for his longtime friend and sparring partner to return it to Vulcan and perhaps be fully regenerated in the fal-tor-pan or refusion process, conducted for the first time in generations. <br>  <br>  In later years, Spock's work became more diplomatic than scientific, initially remaining a part of Starfleet. In 2293, he served as Federation special envoy to the Klingon government, paving the way for the Khitomer peace accords with Chancellor Azetbur. That peace came about with great difficulty and personal turmoil for Spock, in that a conspiracy to sabotage the talks through the assassination of Azetbur's father, Chancellor Gorkon, and the subsequent framing of Kirk and McCoy, involved his own Vulcan protégé, Lt. Valeris. <br>  <br>  After decades as a civilian, in 2368, Spock secretly traveled to Romulus on a personal mission to further the cause of Romulan/Vulcan reunification — a mission which shook up the Federation so that Captain Jean-Luc Picard was sent undercover to determine his motives. On the same trip he was saddened to hear of the death of his father, Sarek, but Picard's presence allowed Spock a final last solace thanks to an earlier Picard-Sarek mind meld. Spock remained to work with the Romulan underground and in 2369, helped arrange the defection of Romulan vice-proconsul M'Ret to the Federation to p|`|ba52jQHyaa	Spock does have another Vulcan name, but it was never said.<br>  <br>  From the episode "This Side of Paradise":<br>  "You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock."-Leila<br>  "You couldn't pronounce it." -Spock<br>  <br>  In "Journey to Babel" Spock's mother says of Vulcan names:<br>  "I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name."-Amanda Gayson<br>  "Can you?"-Kirk<br>  "After a fashion, and after many years of practice."-Amanda Gayson|`|vCidaEbCaa	it has never "officially" been revealed but fan sites have heard of a deleted script scene from 1966 referring to him as ralph... just kidding.. it was V'nek|`|6jkj9crSaa	Vulcans only have one name-in any of the series that I have seen (not just TOS like another reviewer said).

5o66SNZoaa	It is easier to sing im falsetto if you are an alto. Some guys are having problems with their falsetto because of their puberty. If you have a deep voice, it will probably make your falsetto last shorter or crack. Try singing using falsetto everyday and you will be used to it and after some time, you can sing it more efficiently.

lpyWVR2oaa	Both Oppositions represent some challenges and obstacles but of the 2, Pisces Sun- Virgo Moon is a stronger and more harmonious match inherently because the Sun and Moon are natural polarities themselves and the opposite signs will find it easier to blend and locate a middle ground where the masculine yang and feminine yin energies are concerned.<br>  <br>  Pisces Sun - Virgo Sun represents a conflict of innate goals and inner drives and this could sabotage the mutual trust and respect otherwise present in a harmonious Sun-Sun combination.|`|I0waERKqaa	they are both powerful and awesome. <br>  <br>  One will destroy the other.<br>  <br>  Dodge is not big enough for both y'all!!!!!

This is the closest you can get.|`|0G1fOjpWaa	That's too vague, synastry is what you should be looking into, it compares the natal charts of two people and aspects the planets in one chart make to the planets of the others persons chart. From what I know, if one partners moon aspects the others sun and vice versa then you have great compatibility and some astrologers have researched this and found that these aspects often show up in the charts of married couples.....the next most important points would be the vertex and the nodes and rising and descendant points compared in both charts.....then mars and venus...the outer planets don't matter so much unless the aspects are within a very tight orb.

Thats a hell of a lot of water in a chart......|`|AA10197672	This site tells you all that you need to know about your birth date and chart...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astro-software.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal?member=&recalc=&name=Rebecca&sex=f&d1day=3&d1month=11&d1year=1981&d1hour=10&d1min=0&city=Tehran&lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://astro-software.com/cgi-bin/astro/...</a>|`|I0waERKqaa	your vulnerable and you get hurt easy, but your very phychic and smart. <br>  <br>  you have no control over your emotions,|`|mj1dBJEOaa	That is ALOT of water in 3 very important areas of your chart... wow.... must say i like, iv got a soft spot for my fellow watery friends. <br>  <br>  Anyway, sun in scorp (like me!) means:-<br>  There’s a simmering depth to those born with the Sun in Scorpio that can be intimidating. Often you just know they’re intuitively taking in everything around them and revealing very little. And don’t expect instant friendship here, as it takes time to win the trust of the wary Scorpio.<br>  <br>  An outer mask of cool control belies a vast and often turbulent psychic interior from which they draw on. In a word, the Scorpio is intense, and works best in a crucible of pressure and uphill challenges. Without a sense of purpose, the darker emotions can take hold and lead them down the paths of obsession, jealousy and worse.<br>  <br>  The Sun in Scorpio has the drive to succeed, and often has extracurricular activities that take it up a notch. They’re great competitors because of their built-in radar for the weaknesses of the opponent. They’ll remain calm until the exact right moment when a targeted sting will do the most damage. That’s why in relationships of any kind they are a formidable enemy if betrayed.<br>  <br>  The Scorpio often goes into psychological territory that others fear to tread, and emerges both wiser and transformed. They’re the deep-sea divers of the Zodiac, experiencing every situation on many levels, much of it in the unconscious realms. Many Scorpios are drawn to the mysterious and otherworldly, since so much of their nature lies hidden in subterranean waters.<br>  <br>  In a relationship with a Scorpio, you’ve got to be strong-willed to keep from being controlled by their undertow. And never try to hide anything from them, because they’ll quickly “read” it on your face. They’ve earned a reputation for being highly sexual, and need an amorous outlet for all that emotional intensity. To those few they allow into their private worlds, they are fiercely loyal and have an enveloping sensuality that makes all the drama worth it.<br>  <br>  Cancer moon:-<br>  The Scorpio Sun/Cancer Moon combination produces an individual whose feelings are deep and emotionally supercharged. Here, there is a blending of the emotional aggressiveness and/or intensity of feeling and determination associated with Scorpio, coupled with the emotional sensitivity, tenacity of feeling and possessiveness inherent in Cancer. These natives are proud and aloof with a tendency to rely upon themselves more than they rely on others...but, it is difficult for them to say no and stick with that decision when they are approached with an emotional appeal. Not necessarily of an outgoing personality, subjects of this Sun/Moon combination are unlikely to go out of their way for others and are prone to expect friends and acquaintances to come to them instead. These are souls who may be reached courtesy of emotional requests far more easily than by logic or even good sense. Scorpio Sun/Cancer Moon individuals are magnetic with a tremendous amount of self-confidence. Their emotions are exceedingly powerful...their intuitions are keen...and they have an abundance of respect for their hunches. Possessed of suspicious, shrewd and defensive character, natives of this combination are usually very sensitive and jealous in affairs of the heart. Major dangers for these subjects include the tendency to be too receptive, too impressionable and too easily influenced courtesy of feelings and sensations. There is never anything wishy-washy about the attitudes and opinions of these individuals and they are liable to cling tenaciously to their ideals, loves, hates and dreams. Although strongly opinionated and capable of defending a position via argument, natives of this Sun/Moon combination rarely use logic as a weapon. Their arguments twist and turn...frustrating any opponent who would attack their position with pure reason.<br>  <br>  Pisces ascendant:-<br>  If you have Pisces rising, others will see you as generous, sympathetic to those less fortunate, and very sensitive and sentimental. You are the essence of feeling and imagination.<br>  <br>  People may often see Pisces rising as someone they can easily take advantage of because of your capacity for unconditional love and compassion. And in no area is this more true than love. You are the classic candidate for the codependent relationship.<br>  <br>  In matters of love, sex and dating the need to be needed is strong. You must be aware of setting boundaries in relationships otherwise you could be taken advantage of. A Pisces Ascendant must learn to give love without losing the self. If you’re in a good love match however, your dreamy imagination can take love and sex to a whole new dimension.|`|e4cZQ367aa	oh my god you must be sooo sensitive!!! lol<br>  <br>  cancer sun,moon taurus virgo acs
QyQ6XoLbaa	Yes, it is fixable.  And it shouldn't cost much at all if you needed a professional to do it.  The part you are describing is the winding.  It comes is silver/gold wire, solid black plastic, and other types of synthetic ribbon. It is wrapped around the stick of the bow, close to the bottom where you hold it, which is called the "frog."<br>  <br>  Also, if you unscrew the tension screw at the end of the stick, you can take the frog off of the stick.  Just don't twist is around or anything, or you'll tangle the hairs.  If you need to get something back on the stick, you could slide it on without the frog being on.

J30kfJpQaa	Yes, Rebekah has a good point about celebrities focusing on their careers. It is also because egos are involved and each wants to believe they're the best. Plus, they work with so many beautiful people and affairs are bound to happen.|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I'd say! Its because their main focus is their careers, not their significant other...
RKLFYS2Naa	Plot introduction..GOOD LUCK : )<br>  <br>  <br>  The book is about a young Englishman, Robert Lomax, who has just decided to pursue a new career as an artist. He visits Hong Kong in search of inspiration for his paintings where he checks into the Nam Kok Hotel, not realizing, at first, that it is an unofficial brothel catering mainly to British and American sailors. However, the discovery of that fact only makes the hotel more charming in Lomax's opinion and a better source of subject matter for his paintings. He quickly befriends most of the hotel's bargirls but is most fascinated by the archetypal "hooker with a heart of gold", Suzie Wong, who had previously introduced herself to him as Wong Mee-ling, a rich virgin whose father had five houses and more cars than she could count, and initially pretended not to recognize him at the hotel. Lomax had originally decided that he would not sleep with any of the bargirls at the hotel because he would be living with them for a long time and did not want to put a strain on their relationships. However, it soon emerges that Suzie Wong is interested in him, not as a customer but as a serious boyfriend. Although Suzie Wong becomes the kept woman of two other men and Robert Lomax becomes attracted to a young female British nurse, Lomax and Wong are eventually reunited and the novel ends happily.

srtoPxN2aa	I really never cared for the terms 'Math Rock', or 'Mathcore'...Lol.<br>  Though one of the best known, and one of my favorite 'Math Rock' bands from the 90's/00's is 'Don Caballero'. They employ the use of odd time signatures, additive and divisive rhythms, consonant and dissonant chord structures, and irregular-meter experiments like 11/4, and 9/8 time (hence the term 'Math Rock'). Similar in many ways to several of the progressive rock and fusion bands of the 70's that had previously traveled that road, like King Crimson, Gentle Giant, and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Though the more recent 'Math Rock' bands tend to be a little noisier, and don't play with nearly with the same skill or virtuosity in my opinion. With most 'Math Rock' bands, the influence of late 80's early 90's bands such as 'Primus' and 'The Jesus Lizard' can also be heard in their music.<br>  I have a few Don Caballero albums, and most of their stuff Is pretty cool. My favorite albums being 'Don Caballero 2', 'What Burns Never Returns', 'World Class Listening Problem', and 'American Don'.<br>  <br>  Mmmmm Acting, I Love Me Some Good Acting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqSpcPeNwU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqSpcPeN...</a><br>  Sure We Had Knives Around;<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFyJAzFZeBk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFyJAzFZe...</a><br>  I Agree...

Most bands focus on insanely complex time signatures and usually use a lot of dissonance and/or unorthodox chord progressions. Mathcore is the same idea, just in a metal vein.<br>  <br>  The Dillinger Escape Plan is one of the leading math-rock bands around.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Progressive and or technical metalcore that is the official breakdown in the metal community. <br>  <br>  its chaos is what it is lol. In a good way of course.<br>  <br>  Dillinger Escape Plan <br>  The Number 12 Looks Like You <br>  Psyopus<br>  Meshuggah has some elements<br>  If Lucy Fell <br>  <br>  are some good bands in that genre|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Mathcore is like Metalcore but with more complex time signatures and variations of time signatures more often<br>  <br>  very much like progressive|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Yeah, they're all right.<br>  <br>  Math rock has some really crazy time signatures and lots of stops and starts and really complex rhythms.<br>  <br>  Mathcore is basically the same thing but is more influenced by metalcore and other metal genres and is a lot more extreme.<br>  <br>  And yes it is really progressive.<br>  <br>  Don Caballero is a math rock band from around Pittsburgh.<br>  The Fall of Troy<br>  Norma Jean is considered Mathcore<br>  Owls<br>  This Town Needs Guns<br>  Between the Buried and Me<br>  Botch<br>  Protest the Hero<br>  The Number Twelve Looks Like You<br>  The Dillinger Escape Plan|`|oOSNI3wbaa	oh jeez....here we go with more "genre titles".<br>  thats all we need.<br>  i say we just add the word "core" to every word in the dictionary.<br>  hard-core<br>  metal-core<br>  math-core<br>  mall-core<br>  kick your mom in the teeth-core<br>  blowing bubbles-core<br>  otter-core<br>  toilet paper-core<br>  corn on the cob-core<br>  ............ugh.....enough already......|`|KEk728Gsaa	I'm pretty sure mathcore is post-hardcore but with progressive elements. The Fall of Troy, for example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XRME-BIvs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-XRME-BI...</a><br>  <br>  I actually think it is pretty decent music|`|LkN5nr6faa	It's prog-rock on crack. It's basically prog-rock with more tempo changes than thought possible. It also mixes varieties of hardcore influences into the music.

I live in a house that shares the kitchen and washroom..  I only rent one room, and in that room I keep my belongings and my bed and my tv.<br>  If I lived in a place with more than one room, and I was married, I would have my wife have a tv in our bedroom, maybe two tvs.  One for her, and one for me. <br>  If you fall asleep with the tv on, I would not recommend having one in the bedroom.  :)|`|q8wM9A54aa	yes, but it doesnt work :))<br>  we need to fix the antenna, and we dont have time, so we put the tv in the bedroom, and we watch DVDs on it.<br>  but as soon as we fix it, we will put it back in the living room.|`|g1vwbhavaa	i have one in my room...and its always turned on...so if i want to study, i have to go to some other room...or watch tv and study simultaneously...|`|IxOP4qbYaa	No.<br>  I can't imagine ever getting one either.<br>  <br>  Answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AutbD1ZWXWDFgvtz6wibF1Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225092439AArd12v">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|16m5xm2Faa	yes <br>  because we dont have a tv in our living room & we all just watch tv in our rooms or in someone elses room I love laying in my bed & watching tv <br>  & not really|`|UMzd6FHWaa	I have. <br>  Because we find it romantic to cuddle up in peace and watch a movie.<br>   <br>  You have a very distorted imagination there.

I had one but I failed a piece of cw and my dad took it out :(|`|RNnqh8f4aa	LOOL!!!!<br>  <br>  Of course i have one! I think having a computer with internet acces is worser than having a TV in your room. The TV hardly distracts me cause it doesn't have cable....|`|7wGwdwH4aa	NO BUT MY KIDS DO|`|ScIMRB6Eaa	yupp|`|rFXt8ygGaa	no tv in my room|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	yeah but it broke a few weeks ago.....|`|uJLmbINyaa	yes but i dont watch it much|`|Z51fjE2Raa	No. I'm not even allowed a radio in there. :S|`|lDi8nbKKaa	Yes!,i like my space sometimes.|`|PKe37L24aa	Yes i do but i don't really watch it.|`|3onySMD6aa	yes but i let my sister have it|`|FDt7cC8haa	What?

Sometimes you have to raise the bedroom TV to the highest volume so that neighbors don't here the "commotion" ;)<br>  <br>  Also, I fall asleep sooner than my husband and he enjoys watching TV until he falls asleep so I don't mind it.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll have one when you are married|`|8698ad788d29eb3bfd4384d7ea145f3faa	yes, I DO have a TV in my Bedroom.  I've worked hard all my life, and as an Empty-Nesting Retiree, this is one little 'luxury' that I could actually afford to get for myself.  I do watch some DVDs (classics) as I wind down the day, and yes, it is for my relaxation.|`|8916532c2ff3a2ef7f5a443265ce3b2eaa	Haha .. are you kiddin' me? There's a TV in every room of the house. Our bedroom is our escape .. when we want to have alone time and get away from our teenagers. I don't see how a TV would cause 'disruptions' since you can turn it off. :)|`|BLEYaodFaa	I've been married for 13 years, and yes I have one in my bedroom.  I always have.  No, it doesn't cause disruptions, because we turn it off at times.|`|KVzBqWhvaa	Yes.

tGkhYbM2aa	There are lots of girls out there that would love to have you pay attention to their feet.  Some girls find it a turn on.  Right?|`|naI5hGjHaa	everyday, the same questions.<br>  <br>  i think you should mention it on your 360 page or google online and you can find girls that share that same fetish with you.|`|86acf988bd253bcd1586d895b2e5a43aaa	Find a girl who wears nylons and heels to make your fantasy come true. Good luck!
c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	Wow..have you gotten some VERY varied answers!  I don't even see a pattern....<br>  I get along great with either, but gravitate and seem to get along best with guys...I am more relaxed and feel myself with them.<br>  I grew-up with a brother and all boy cousins...<br>  I am a 50 year old, straight, married female (no natural children).|`|z9hRuFDiaa	Both, but I seem to get along with men a little bit better. As far as the women in my home growing up, there was my mother, my older sister, my younger sister and myself. The men in my home were my father and my older brother. <br>  <br>  Good luck in your research.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	lets see....boyz *love my buddies of all sexs*<br>  im in a house with 3 guys and 4 girls.............<br>  lets just say a rather spend a night in the woods<br>  then be in the house with any of them lol|`|Le53Bggxaa	I get along with both, but somehow I feel more comfortable with guys since they don't give me odd looks and probably wont talk behind my back.<br>  <br>  I could also feel I could act more goofy towards them where a girl might most likely overthink my behavior or something. Ah girls rule, huh?|`|VU97XJzfaa	It's hard for me to make friends with anyone equally. I am an only child.|`|G4zzGaZ9aa	both but its a little easier for me to talk to guys idk why<br>  <br>  i grew up with a mom, dad, younger sister, and a cat|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	I make friends with anyone who wants to be friends.  <br>  I grew up with two older brothers.|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Usually with other blokes, Have alot more In common e.g. (Football and Beer) :P<br>  <br>  Grew up with a younger brother, Have two sisters but I left before they were born|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	I'm a female but for some reason i seem to make better friends with guys.

I have 3 really close girl best friends and 4 really close guy best friends. <br>  <br>  I think it all really depends on the person. There are some guys that I just don't like and there are some girls that I just don't like.<br>  <br>  I have a brother? Lol.|`|DdEzv3NCaa	Neither really. I'd only make friends with people who like me(otherwise it's not fair on them).  I do have to admit I have more girl friends than boy friends. But boys hardly really put effort into meeting and making friends with a girl, not all boys but some.<br>  <br>  Most boys are amazing and sweet. Some are just too lazy to see girls for who they are.|`|N4JUrdbsaa	I'm still growing up in my home, but as of now it's two girls (my mom and sister), and no boys (excluding myself).<br>  <br>  I make friends easier with those of my own gender, actually, as I can relate to them more.|`|TmKZk7Joaa	equally, but still find it easier to bond with boys 'cuz i'm quite a tomboy. plus, most girls can get catty when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  no brothers but loads of male friends. 2 sisters.|`|9fAHd15Caa	dude DEFINETLY guys, girls are soooo dramatic about everything<br>  <br>  my mom, two older sisters, one younger sister and one younger brother|`|CULqCWvXaa	i grew up with five other siblings.

I grew up with four girls and two boys. x|`|UM9LlPWDaa	opposite for me. I had a bad experience with a girl friend in high school and since then haven't been able to make friends with girls...|`|I5AkYjUcaa	.Opposite|`|naI5hGjHaa	both.<br>  <br>  i was never that uncomfortable around either gender|`|4YB5Em78aa	i make friends with guys better because females are just stuck up and some have bad attitudes. guys are much more fun to hang out with anyway.|`|NDbI6Gxeaa	I think its easier for same sex, but them are also easier to lose.<br>  and just my mom and dad|`|ntef2sPMaa	boys. and i grew up with 1 brother and 2 sisters|`|wDCjzuPraa	3 bros 1 sis|`|uoV5JYzfaa	i get along better with guys<br>  <br>  i have one sister<br>  and my mom and dad<br>  growing up!|`|dU0jFx4taa	opposite gender, all the best friends I've ever had have been guys<br>  <br>  mum, dad, brother...|`|AA11969873	my own gender<br>  <br>  2 boy<br>  3 girl|`|cnyThvcMaa	both :)<br>  <br>  i get on with everyone to be honest|`|vur2faQ4aa	both. i try to get along with everyone|`|ScIMRB6Eaa	yeah I do<br>  <br>  Excluding my mom and dad, I grew up with my brother|`|79F1VhEJaa	i think the opposite sex...<br>  i have 1 dad, 1 mom, and 1 brother at my house...<br>  :)|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	I maker friends much easier with males.

SWxnbKyyaa	The point is like everyone said, if you know that the guy is a liar you will follow the opposite to what he says and if he is truthful you follow the same<br>  <br>  But the problem is that you dont know who the liar is and who the truthful guy is,isnt?<br>  So I would start to ask one guard<br>  "Can you say whether the door behind me leads to lion or paradise and also the color of the door behind me"?<br>  <br>  since he lies he will say the wrong color,if he saying the truth he will say the correct color, which I can use it to infer what he is saying is true or false|`|emKXU1QFaa	Ask what is my name.  You already know the answer if they are correct you go through, if not go the other way.|`|Ks4YN4iHaa	This is a complicated answer to explain but easy to find out the door to paradise. All you have to do is ask one of the guards what door the other guard would say is the door to paradise. <br>  What ever the guard says go to get to paradise the opposite door is actually the door to paradise. <br>  Lets say you ask the truth guard what the other guard would say since the other guard will lie he would point to the door of doom and that is the door the truth teller would point to. <br>  if you asked the liar what the other guard would say is the door to freedom he would know which door the truth guard would point to and and since he lies he would point to the other door which leads to doom. <br>  so in the end ask the guard what door the other guard would say is the door to freedom and go to the opposite door|`|IfQr8V4daa	You ask either "which would the other say is the door to paradise?" and go through the opposite or "which would the other say is the door to the lion?" and go through that one.<br>  <br>  The liar will lie about the other ones answer (the other one being the truth teller).  If you ask "which would the other say is the door to paradise?" the liar will tell you the door to the lion since the other one would honestly tell you the door to paradise.  If you ask "which would the other say is the door to the lion?" the liar will tell you the door to paradise since the other would honestly tell you the door to the lion.<br>  <br>  The honest one will truthfully tell you what the other says (the other being the liar).  If you ask the honest one "which would the other say is the door to paradise?" he will tell you the door to the lion since the other would lie and say the door to the lion.   If you ask "which would the other say is the door to the lion?" he will tell you the door to paradise since the other would lie and say the door to paradise.|`|9e3u1iyPaa	i know this joke its sopposed to be a bomb and a million dollars <br>  <br>  start punching them which one says stop tells the truth <br>  <br>  ask him where is the paradise and your home free|`|RXeuiz95aa	Exactly what Jason said.<br>  <br>  Ask "which would the other one say is the door to paradise?"<br>  <br>  [:|`|q13fpGy4aa	The Answer is "If I asked the other guard (guy), which path would he indicate is paradise?"

rseD4OG2aa	A few times, and it really sucks. There have been a few times on the bench press, right at the end of my workout, where I'll get to the last rep before my maximum and it'll fall on my chest. It pisses me off more than it hurts.<br>  Another time, and this isn't really dropping weights, I was doing sit ups. I had my ipod on loud and I was totally zoned into what I was doing. The gym in my house is in the basement and I'd left the door open slightly. The next thing I know my dog (he's a golden retriever) walks in and is standing right over my face, about two inches away. I couldn't stop laughing.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* Oh, that sucks. When that happens I'm always pissed because I didn't get it up and then its on my chest and I have to roll it down to my hips so I can sit up. Its always awkward and I end up leaving big red marks on my stomach. Brutal.|`|7Ce2oC9Yaa	dropped a 20 pound weight on my foot|`|V29AonY7aa	I just wasn't paying attention.

Music theory is important. Then find some people who can do the same and make sure that you get along, have a similar and not the same taste in music. Make sure that your singer can actually sing. Either start to write your own music or learn some covers to get the ball rolling.Find a place to practice and practice a lot. Preferable a place where your neighbors won't get mad or your parents and you won't get the cops called on you. Have your family and friends not in the band listen to you and get there honest opinion. If they don't like the way you sound chances are its gonna be a lot harder for others to like you.  If your an original band make sure you have at least 35 to 40 minutes of original material before you play a show. Same if your a cover band. Practice stage presence don't just stand still while on stage. People go to shows to be entertained. Don't form a band just to try to get famous have more fun with it. This is just a start of what to do.

s2JBY0ewaa	well In the beggining of the show, it shows that Veronica was raped at a party because she was drugged with GHB and shes been traumatized because of it. ...when her and Logan begin dating, she later finds out that Logan was the one who supplied the GHB at the party.. resulting in her rape that night.<br>  <br>  She suspects of him being her rapist. But she discovers it aint him. They get back together and then she finds cameras in his room. Basically for recording the action that goes on in his room. So i guess they brake up. Oh and she also starts to think Logan killed her friend Lilly. <br>  <br>  Turn out the cameras where set up by Logans dad and his dad turns out to be the killer. They get back together... but brakeup again because Logan getting in lots of trouble and she does it to hopefully realize he's gonna loose more if he keeps heading down the wrong road.<br>  <br>  <br>  They get back together again after he rescues her from being raped from someone at their college. somewhere in between.... the series endes with Logan and Veronica leaving their relationship unresolved|`|yUInFtXyaa	After his arrest and subsequent acquittal for Felix's death, Logan became a target of the P.C.H. Biker gang. He didn't help the situation by getting his friends involved, and actively pursuing revenge. I think Veronica was definitely shaken after the shotgun blast incident. Veronica was worried about him, and felt that he was making the situation worse. She wanted him to stop, but he wouldn't listen, so she decided to break up with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Veronica: I kept thinking that if I just stuck by you, that you'd get past this- this phase and you'd be you again.<br>  Logan: Are you breaking up with me?<br>  Veronica: I can't stay with you. Not with you and your toadies cruising around at night and hatching plans, refusing to let everything get back to normal. Someone's gonna get killed, Logan.<br>  Logan: Someone already has, did you forget that already? And most of the people in this town think I did it. Those people you call "toadies" are my friends; they've got my back.<br>  Veronica: It's not about protection, Logan. It's about pride. And the thing that I can't stand is that…I'm pretty sure there's a part of you that's having fun with all of this.

They only bring a couple of things so the brunette brought a mini-fridge that runs on batteries. The red head goes, "Why did you bring a fridge?" She answers back, "So we have things to store food in. Why do you have a gun in your hand?" Red-head answers, "Just in case we run out of food." They both turn to the blonde who is carrying a car door. They both go, "Why are you carrying a car door?"

"Show me." <br>  The redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream. <br>  The doctor said, "You're not really a redhead, are you? <br>  "Well, no" she said, "I'm actually a blonde." <br>  "I thought so," the doctor said. "Your finger is broken."<br>  <br>  A blonde decided to take up ice fishing for a hobby. She went to the library and bought every book they had on that subject. So, after a couple weeks of studying, she got all packed up and ready to go. When she got to the ice, she started to cut a hole when all of a sudden there was a voice that shouted "THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THIS ICE!"  the blonde continues, thinking that the voice is just in her head. the voice sais again "THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THIS ICE!!!!" the blonde looks up and sais "God is that you?" The voice sais again "NO, THIS IS THE ICE RINK MANAGER!!!"<br>  <br>  Three blondes were walking through the forest when they came upon a set of tracks.<br>  <br>  The first blonde said, "Those are deer tracks."<br>  The second blonde said, "No, those are elk tracks."<br>  The third blonde said, "You're both wrong, those are moose tracks."<br>  The blondes were still arguing when the train hit them<br>  <br>  Two blondes walk into a bar... you would think one of them would of seen it|`|Y2AK1Ysvaa	I'll list a few:<br>  <br>  1) How do you kill a dumb blond?<br>  <br>  answers: Drop a magazine perfume scratcher in a pool or Drop a purse off a sky scraper.<br>  <br>  2)  Okay, so a blonde walks into a barber shop listening to her iPod.  The barber says you should probably take the head phones out of your ears if you'd like a good haircut.  She doesn't say anything.  The barber again says, I'm warning you, take out the head phones if you want a good hair cut!  The dumb blond yet again doesn't say or do anything.  The barber then figures that she probbaly can't here because the volume is to loud.  The barber takes off the head phones and says "Alright, that's better, now to begin."  The barber then realizes a few moment later that the blonde is dead. The barber puts the head phones in her ears and hears, "Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in, Breathe out."<br>  <br>  3)  A blonde, a brunete, and a red haired person are stuck on an island.  They suddenly get 1 wish each.  The brunete wishes to be rescued by her parents.  The red haired person wishes to get rescued by someone famous.  Then, the blonde girl wishes, "I wish my friends where here."<br>  <br>  4) (This one isn't a dumb blond joke, but very funny)  Okay so someone walks up to a Genie lamp and kicks it.  A magical Genie comes and says "You get 3 wishes, but since you kicked the lamp your enemy gets x2 what ever you wish for."  So first he wishes for $1,000,000 dollars, so his enemy gets $2,000,000.  Then she wishes for a mansion.  So his enemy gets 2 mansions.  Then the person says to the Genie, "Well, I've always wanted to donate a kidney."|`|eroEFDmfaa	A blonde is riding the bus home.

To her surprise the music was still playing....she had been listening to her Ipod the whole time!|`|Cq2CVuhcaa	how do you drown a blonde? put a scratch and sniff sticker at the bottom of the pool. <br>  <br>  <br>  i can tell you're a blonde, you can't spell.|`|qlRivgdnaa	Two Blondes are lying in a field in Arkansas.

You can kiss goodbye to your career if that happens, particularly as you are studying Law as you need to be squeeky clean in that profession.  Only you can decide.<br>  <br>  PS you can always sign the contract and then pull out at the last minute when you have thought about it for longer.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	How could spending a few weeks being watched behaving like a moron in a house full of morons be your biggest ambition in life?  Surely you have more self-respect than that?  You are an intelligent person to be able to study Law.  Try valuing yourself for that, rather than sinking to the low level of the people you may have to defend if you are called to the Bar or become a solicitor!|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	go for it you don't get many  chances like that in life, that is if you really want it  ,if you feel half hearted i wouldn't bother but hey ho better to try  or you'll always be thinking  if only...<br>  <br>  good luck anyway whatever you decide to do|`|AA11280073	What is more important to you? Being on the show and losing a year out of your education or being respected lawyer? Sounds like a no-brainer to me.|`|aKhZNd7daa	As an RTV REG - I can't say any more than Bluebell !!|`|akcGfgdcaa	Sign the contract if being on Big Brother is what you really want, you can pull out at any time before or during your time in the house should you happen to be picked. So if they do happen to choose you, you still have options.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think 15mins of fame is worth missing out on your long-term future and career. Plus, would people respect you as a lawyer/solicitor when all they know you for is as a BB contestant?!|`|HvOJ182qaa	do it man! (Big brother)<br>   it'll be a once in a life time oppertunity, thousands of people audition and they are considering you Amongst ALL those people, so you must have something special thats caught their eye!<br>  <br>  Say they pick you and you do go in, just be yourself, have as much fun as possible and just enjoy the experience!<br>  Just don't do anything to make you hated (like Charley and Grace did)<br>  <br>  You obviousley wanted to go in, otherwise you wouldn't have applied/auditioned.<br>  <br>  Go for it!<br>  This time next year you could be famous and have a S...h,,,It load of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck:)|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Screw Big Brother! I love the show but do you really want to be portrayed like that? I mean they make everyone look bad! Do not put your degree on hold for a reality show. I promise, you will look back on that and be disgusted with yourself. Passing on BB is not going to bring more regret than putting your life on hold to be made out to look bad on national television. Just think of how it could possibly affect your professional life if you did get on the show and were made a fool of (not saying that you will, but it is definitely possible). Ultimately you need to decide which is more important, but if it were me...career would be my choice!|`|ACLIVzy7aa	I'd say it's a huge risk. Do you really want to work in the field you have chosen? Are you 100% sure law is your passion? The question you have to ask yourself is this: Can fifteen minutes of fame on a reality show equal 3 years of hard work? Will Big Brother do anything for you? Remember BB is not taken seriously and most people think the contestants are life's losers and nut jobs. First impressions count and it's hard to change people's minds when something is portrayed in a certain way. Will you be taken seriously as a lawyer after being on BB? Not likely. It's a mistake. Don't do it.|`|XZi4UJgGaa	Don't go on Big Brother. You could seriously hurt your career. If they make you look bad, people will remember you. Some future employer might recgonize you from tv. Think about clients and co-workers who might recgonize you from tv. Not the best idea. People will talk about you over the web. Your pictures will be on the internet. This stuff doesn't go away. A few years from now, there will still be stuff about you on the internet if you decide to go on Big Brother. Too risky.<br>  <br>  If you have nothing to lose, then go for it. But in my opinion, I wouldn't risk a law degree over Big Brother.|`|tHwXESv1aa	The more experiences you have in life, the wiser you are. Some of your friends might be laughing at you if you join BB and leave your studies for awhile. But this experience does not come every day. So I'd say go for it, learn from it, know different personalities, and enjoy. Then come back to your studies.No pressure.Life is about learning.Don't hurry things up.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Well congrats in getting so far! If it's one of your ambitions you should go for it, just if you get in there don't be nasty or anything so they don't have any way to portray you badly, be yourself but if you start getting angry or wanting to hit out at someone, walk away. Don't act like Katraya and be over the top happy annoying or Darnell/Alex and be aggressive and threatening. If you really have changed your mind though and don't want to do it, don't. Make sure you read the contract 100% before you sign and you feel happy doing the stuff it wants you to. The thing is if you are portrayed well like a nice, funny person but not annoying (like Kat and Rachel BB9) then it could help your career but if portrayed badly like argumentaive, bullying ect then it could ruin it. It is actually a big risk.|`|qHwI9ev8aa	If you wish to be a professional person then I don't think it would be great for your career to be seen on one of those reality TV shows. Think of how people on those shows are portrayed! If you end up being cast in an unfavorable light, it could hurt you in the future.<br>  <br>  I don't think appearing on a reality TV show is a big life ambition, but if your ambition to be on TV for 15 minutes is bigger than that of being a lawyer (which you have spent years preparing for) then maybe you should reconsider your career choice.|`|VJiWuikpaa	go to big brother give it a shot youll have a brilliant experience from it and when you come out resume your last year do it do it<br>  <br>  ill vote for ya to stay in|`|czHjKjULaa	Well I mean I hate to say it but I personally would go with the law degree over big brother. Like you said if BB goes horribly wrong, then you've just wasted your chance to get a degree in law! Choose wisely!|`|HVQvj72taa	Go on it and i will vote 4 u to win|`|CUEco2LEaa	Don't do it! Very few people watch Big Brother anymore but there is always the faithful tabloids. They will dig up dirt on you and your family. You could say something in the house completely innocently, but be vilified for it. You are particularly vulnerable given your law career. Concentrate on your career. At least you can say you auditioned. <br>  <br>  You don't want to up like Chanelle or Chantelle, where your future success will be measured in terms of how dark your fake tan is, how big your fake boobs are or who you are dating. <br>  <br>  Think of the long run. You have come so far and done really well to get into law. I know lots of people who wanted to and couldn't. Don't throw it all away on BB!
