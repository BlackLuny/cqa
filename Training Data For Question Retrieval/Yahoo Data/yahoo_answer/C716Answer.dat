o3RDPOgqaa	bb4...be back for _____ ? idk, its not even on urban dictionary XD
wbXp71i4aa	I know exactly what you are going through, well from his perspective. My girlfriend, who loves me very much, was getting a lot of texts and phone calls from this other dude that she just met. At first she didn't think anything of it so she just treated him like a friend, which is im guessing how you see this guy. But the constant phone calls and texts really bothered me so I talked to her about it and she immediately called the guy and told him to back off a little bit. I didn't expect her to do this, but she said she would rather him not call or text than lose me so I didn't argue about it. I have a feeling this is the only way that you are going to gain his trust back. You need to sit your boyfriend down and let him listen to you call the dude and tell him to stop calling so much. This doesn't mean you still can't be friends with him, but your boyfriend should be the priority in this situation.|`|4DrPFCXnaa	Never talk to the other guy again (the sister's friend) if you want to still be with your bf. Apologize to your bf, and make him some mac and cheese.
b96c933904a41f16f89d25d42ccf0c38aa	Do you like him back? And it depends weather you care what they are saying about you.  If you don't like what they are saying, and it is not true that you like him or don't want anyone to think that your with him.  You should stand up for yourself.|`|0HXzYOmMaa	Well, if your shy to stand up for yourself and just tell people that he's your friend, I get the impression that you have some feelings for this guy. But if you don't, just tell everyone that he is your friend. Just tell them that that's just your guy-friend, not your boyfriend.
z8cTKQswaa	Sounds Like a bad situation! Someone will get hurt and most likely it will be the caller.|`|KuNM2j9caa	This depends on the situation in its entirety.  If he was married to his ex and they, possibly, have children together, then I would say, "Yes, he still has feelings for her."  That does not mean that he would betray his current wife.  I don't think I would tell her to stop calling completely either.  I would make sure she understood not to call unless it was to discuss an issue that she was certain I would be genuinely concerned with.  If you haven't talked to him about the way you feel, then you should.  The only other advice I can offer is don't approach him with your questioning his integrity of fidelity.
LRpHEUSbaa	Ob nun platonische Beziehung oder platonische Ehe, ich verstehe das folgenderma?en: Zwei Menschen (egal welchen Geschlechts, Mann zu Frau oder Frau zu Frau oder Mann zu Mann) fühlen sich rein Menschlich voneinander so angezogen, dass sich eine tiefe Freundschaft oder sogar Liebe entwickelt. Diese beiden Menschen merken irgendwann, dass sie sich gegenseitig so bereichern, dass sie dann auch den Alltag miteinander teilen m?chten und gehen eine tiefere Bindung zueinander ein, was auch in einer Ehe oder festen Beziehung münden kann. Nach einer Zeit merken sie vielleicht, dass sie zwar vom Intellekt und vom emotionalen her absolut auf einer Wellenl?nge sind, aber sich k?rperlich gar nicht anziehend finden, auf die Beziehung oder Ehe aber auf keinen Fall verzichten wollen. Daraus entstehen dann oftmals Vereinbarungen, aus denen dann mit beider Einverst?ndniss au?ereheliche geschlechtliche Beziehungen mit jeweils anderen Partnern resultieren. Wenn das auf einer fairen Absprache beruht, also der "Fremdgeh-Faktor" aus dem Weg ger?umt wurde, ist das sicherlich eine Art ein Paar, dass sich ansonsten im Leben so viel zu geben hat, zusammen zu halten. Meine Art solch ein "Problem" zu l?sen, w?re es nicht, da ich von Promiskuit?t nicht viel halte.|`|meKrqoglaa	Viele M?nner sind aus gesundheitlichen Gründen (z.B.Diabetis)<br>  impotent!<br>  Frauen haben Probleme mit ihrer Libido!<br>  Aber deshalb mu? eine Beziehung nicht schlecht sein!<br>  Sex ist nicht alles!<br>  Für mich w?r das allerdings nichts, solange ich gesund bin!|`|nSxwBvZjaa	Ein Leben ohne Sex gibt es nicht....also es gibt zwei M?glichkeiten:<br>  1. es ist ist eine Zweckehe...jeder amcht seins...<br>  2. es ist gelogen<br>  <br>  <br>  Mal im ernst..welcher Mann kann schon stillhalten, wenn ne hübsche Frau aus dem Bad kommt oder welche Frau..wenn da gerade ein Knackarsch am Kühlschrank blinzelt?<br>  <br>  <br>  Vielleicht nicht gleich aber mit der Zeit?.....|`|rv9pdAqmaa	Ich wei? nicht ob ich das k?nnte - aber für m?glich halte ich das durchaus. Sagt man nicht auch, das Freundschaft in einer Ehe das Wichtigste ist? Aber ob es wirklich so ganz ohne Knistern geht?|`|JCHEJqzNaa	Doch, das gibt es. Ich habe eine Bekannte, die per Zeitungsannonce einen Partner fand. Diese Ehe h?lt schon seit über 15 Jahren. Der Mann ist seit einem schwerem Unfall impotent und sie will einfach keine k?rperliche Liebe. Beide gehen sehr liebevoll miteinander um. Ich bin sogar überzeugt, dass sie sich lieben.|`|ODFXuQY6aa	Gibt es das denn, Schatz? von Anfang an??<br>  Hmmm, na ja es gibt nichts was es nichts gibt<br>  Zweckehen...<br>  einfach gute Freunde, die heiraten aus finanziellen Gründen oder damit sich die Nachbarn nett die M?uler zerreisse...<br>  oder 1 Partei ist homo. So einen Fall kenne ich, aber das kam erst im Laufe der Ehe heraus, haben auch Kinder, sind zusammen geblieben, sind es immer noch, platonisch weiter gemacht..sie hat manchmal einen Freund gehabt (ok, er wahrscheinlich auch) :)

El9Tga1iaa	I think that if he would take the time to stand there, and wait, he would want you to say something. So next time you see him, or talk to him, tell him how you feel. It could result into a very worthwhile relationship. Do it soon, before it's too late, or you won't know what it would be like to spend many hours with him. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes, <br>  <br>  PeterBliss
1d7aafb3494cb6934ee78c563cc11076aa	If he has you labeled only as a slut than maybe he not right for you. Like me there are some guys that despite what a girl has done in the past  we don't judge and give her a chance. He must respect you. Just be yourself he aught to be sweet and nice to you. Just test him before you make your decision. Now 14 and sex twice already? I'm not say your bad or telling you how to live your life, but your very young be Careful OK. Whatever happens Good Luck!|`|7380babc880c58c93f5ba5eb5a92c198aa	You cant he already thinks youz hoe. If youz gonna let him rip why try to front.|`|GJMBGuYqaa	He thinks you are a $lut because your past partners seemed to have talked to him and your belief that "appearring sweet and nice" means that you don't have sex.  You can date someone and not have sex.  That is what a relationship is about is getting to know each other, enjoying spending time with each other, and caring for each other whether you are wearing your clothes or not.<br>  <br>  I may be wrong, but from your brief description, he is only interested in you because he knows that you are willing to have sex, and you only seem validated if guys want to have sex with you.  Try a new approach.  Keep your clothes on and date a boy for once.  Flirt, kiss, touch, but don't take your clothes off and don't have sex for a while.  If the guy is really interested in you, he will still be with you six, nine, twelve months later.  Otherwise, as soon as he has had sex with you, he will start looking for his next conquest, and keep having sex with you until he nails the next one.

El9Tga1iaa	First Question: <br>  No, age doesn't matter in this situation. My parents are twelve years apart. Not that you need to be dating anybody twelve years older than you, but you are the same age right now. <br>  <br>  Second Question: <br>  Just wait it out and see what happens. Be friends, he will never know if you actually will be a good couple again if he doesn't know what's going on in your life. <br>  <br>  Third Question:<br>  There is no way to do it without trying to. Unless of course you wait for him to come to you. <br>  <br>  Note: You are thirteen (going on fourteen), you need to calm down on this. You don't need to start freaking out about relationships until you decide you want to step up another level in intamacy. But tell him you still have feeling for him. It is that simple.
NgAl7LjDaa	ok well since you dont like him...then u just say "i had no idea you were feeling this way about me, but i just thought of us as great friends, i'm sorry..i hope we can still be friends." or something like tht, dont show a sign of anger  tht he did what he did, just say calmy...and it would be better if u did it to his face and not over aim. just hope this helps. =)

If you two are meant to be together again, it will happen, don't force it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
TBcGAWAxaa	Those people you talk to do remember you, so just talk to them. You don't have to be all crazy for someone to remember you. Chill, Relax, Be Social. Talk to one person at a time. If you are not positive have a least an 3 min. conversation about anything, and then when you see that person again, don't get scared, talk and see if you guys can hang. Have Fun! You have to show that you are an approachable person. Smile and laugh at jokes. That's the only way to overcome. But you gotta take it one step at a time.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps.....|`|LjJ5SGagaa	hmmm....get involved in community activities,school activities,something to get u noticed! i was painfully shy until last year when my best friend talked me into joining the school drama team. now im so crazy and outgoing they can't get me to shut up! lol|`|deNUYkHLaa	You're not alone. I went through the EXACT SAME thing. Only I was like 8. Anyway, just try to start something. "Hey, how ya doin?" is a good start. Be out there.

QriyGNq8aa	ja ehrlich, wenn es  nur einmal gewesen w?re.....mhh, ok.....aber so oft?? und dann will sie über die ereignisse auch nicht reden? ich an deiner stelle k?nnte ihr auch ncht mehr vertrauen...is ja v?llig verst?ndlich. und bei jedem mann mit dem sie sich unterh?lt würde ich auch einen liebhaber oder so vermuten...<br>  so hart es klingt, ich würde  mich von ihr trennen...auch wenn es weh tut, der schmerz geht vorbei irgendwann...aber wenn si emit dir alt werden will und du nicht hat es auch keinen sinn mit ihr zusammenzubleiben, besonders unter den umst?nden....|`|ANuej58maa	Schick sie zum Teufel,aber schnell. Das h?rt sich an als ob sie mit Dir machen k?nnte was sie will und mit Dir spielt. Du kannst was viel besseres haben.<br>  <br>  Es tut zwar weh,aber glaub mir,nach einigen Wochen schon wirst Du erleichter sein,denn es tut viel mehr weh immer zu spüren dass was nicht stimmt als einfach mal einen Schlussstrich zu ziehen. Lenke Dich ab,gehe weg und lerne andere Frauen kennen. <br>  <br>  Auf keinen FAll würde ich mich wenn ich ein Mann w?re so wie einen Waschlappen behandeln lassen,und genau das benützt sie,Deine Gutmütigkeit!!

Gibt es andere Ursachen?<br>  Das wird Dich wohl eine weile besch?ftigen.<br>  Und auch wenns unter Moralisten, religi?sen Fanatikern  und Monogamen je de Menge Widerstand gibt, man kann trotzdem wunderbar zusammenleben!! Nur muss immer eine gemeinsame Basis vorhanden sein.....<br>  Toleranz kann anfangs weh tun aber dann gut tun...nur jeder ist nicht dazu in der Lage und das ist nichts negatives..es ist halt so.<br>  <br>  hier mal ein interessanter Artikel:<br>  <a href="http://www.aufrecht.net/utu/promiskuitaet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aufrecht.net/utu/promiskuitae...</a>|`|qGfjyH1Oaa	Du glaubst wirklich noch ans Gute im Menschen.

Was ist das den für ein Quatsch fremdgehen mit "da gab es noch was abzuschlie?en" oder ich war "verliebt" zu begründen? Wie kann sie sich in jemand anderen verlieben wenn sie dich doch liebt?

Und trotzdem wird sie mit 3 anderen Intime? Und bei dem einem ist es auch noch ne Verliebtheit? Meiner Meinung nach solltest du dir Gedanken machen ob es eine Frau wert ist sich so verletzen zu lassen! Natürlich tut eine Trennung weh, aber das geht vorbei, aber wei?t du ob sie dir jetzt Treu ist, oder ob sie dir noch mehr weh tut?|`|e4xAamxlaa	Der richtige Schritt ist ,einen zurüch und einen Tritt in den Hintern|`|fjCyZDMCaa	Zuerst würde ich dir raten,erstmal  mit ihr darüber ordentlich zu  diskutieren warum sie das gemacht hat?Und fragen,ob sie vielleicht mit euer Beziehung unzufrieden war,deswegen sie dich betrogen hat?oder war das aus reiner lust?oder hatte sie jemanden verführt?Egal wie du es fragen willst,finde den Grund heraus.<br>  Dann kannst du immer noch sehen,ob es überhaupt ein Wert hat euer Beziehung weiterzuführen.Ich denke kaum das das Vertrauen zwischen euch so schnell wieder kommt.Da einfach der Schmerz zur Zeit zu gross ist für dich.Falls du ihr eine Chance gibts,dann solle sie dir beweisen,dass du ihr wieder vertrauen kannst.Mit Gefühlen andere soll man nicht spielen.<br>  Es ist schon mutig von ihr dir zu beichten,dass sie dich betrogen hat,aber du würdest auch einen sehr grossen Mut zeigen, wenn du ihr verzeihst.Deswegen,rate ich dir mal mit ihr offen und ehrlich darüber zu reden,wie schmerzlich das ist  für dich und wie es mit euch weitergehen soll.Falls du ihr eine 2. Chance geben wirst, mache ihr ganz deutlich klar, wenn sie dir nochmal wehtut,dass es mit euch endgültig vorbei ist!Auch wenn dir das nicht leicht fallen wird,falls es nochmal passieren sollte,glaub mir der Schmerz wird vorbei gehen!Da,es dir offensichtlich viel an ihr liegt,schlaf darüber nach und diskutiere mit ihr alle plus und minus Punkte in euer Beziehung und sagt ihr,dass wenn sie eine 2.Chance bekommt,dass dir viel an Treue liegt in der Beziehung.<br>  P.S.Bloss keine Vergeltung!|`|j8Lf00Unaa	Das vertrauen ist auf jeden Fall hin und ich glaube nicht, das ihr eine gemeinsame, sorglose Zukunft habt, denn jede Versp?tung oder unerreichbarkeit ihrerseits wird dein misstrauen wieder wecken,zu recht, denn mal ganz im ernst, 3mal, das passiert nie und nimmer wenn man glücklich ist und seinen Partner liebt, vor allen Dingen nicht in einer Beziehung,die erst 11/2 Jahre dauert. Da müsste sie normalerweise noch nur Augen für dich haben. Du solltest dich trennen, auch um dir die n?chste Entt?uschung mit ihr zu ersparen, denn die kommt gewiss.|`|mtZQqoO8aa	Einmal ist gearde mal noch zu verzeihen. Beim zweiten Mal gibt es kein Bertrauen mehr. Aber beim dritten mal hat es einfach keinen Sinn mehr. Du hast was besseres verdient. Trenne dich von ihr und schlie?e mit der Sache ab. Wenn du mit ihr zusammenbleibst,rei?en die alten Wunden immer wieder auf. Sie will mit dir alt werden ,wenn alles genauso bleibt wie es ist. Das hei?t, fremd gehen,fremd gehen und wieder fremd gehen. Abenteuer erleben,aber trotzdem eine Sicherheit haben ,wenn sie nach Hause kommt,nicht alleine zu sein.Wenn sie dich wirklich von ganzen Herzen dich lieben würde,dann würde sie dir nicht so derma?en weh tun. Du findest bestimmt was besseres.|`|wLMYbPocaa	Da gibt es nur einen Schritt: schlu?machen. Es ist nuhr eine Frage der Zeit bis sie dich wieder betrügt weil einer besser ist als du. Oder gerade greifbar war. La? dich von ihr nicht so verarschen. Such dir eine die dich will und verdient hat. <br>  Ich wei? aus eigener Erfahrung wie weh das tut. Ich bin aber verheiratet und komme deswegen nicht ganz so einfach da raus. Aber ich bin schwer entt?uscht und verletzt von meinem Mann der mir mal ewige Treue geschworen hatte. Er hat eine Aff?re die schon l?nger geht sie ist jetzt sogar schwanger von ihm. Von ihm gewollt sagt sie. Und da? es ihm nicht nuhr um Sex geht bei ihr. Egal das geh?rt nicht hier her. Für mich ist das Thema Ehe erledicht.<br>  La? dich nicht verarschen. Gieb ihr einen Tritt und such dir eine die dich verdient.|`|4436eb68c3b0ec7f9575cd1f3ca679b9aa	Dir ist Treue wichtig und Du kannst ihr nicht mehr vertrauen..<br>  Das tut mir echt leid, das ist echt übel. Du bist "besser" , als die anderen? Es war nicht mal nur Sex, sondern kuscheln ? Das ist alles echt sehr schlimm. <br>  Versuchst Du, Dir Deine Würde zu erhalten, in dem Du "besser" warst? Im Kuscheln? <br>  Ganz ehrlich: Ich kenne es, wenn man seine gesamte Würde und Ehre, seinen Stolz und Respekt vor sich selber einfach in die Tonne tritt, um die Liebe zu halten. Aber wo soll das hinführen? Und sie will nicht mal jetzt mit Dir darüber reden. Ich denke, da hat sie sich zu viel geleistet und das wird nie wieder gut. Die Frage ist, wie es weiter gehen sollte. Du liebst sie und sie wird Dich wieder betrügen. Eine Trennung w?re der richtige Schritt, weil er sicher auf jeden Fall kommen wird. Aber das kannst Du Dir nicht gefallen lassen, so winzig kann Deine Selbstliebe nicht sein.<br>  Ich wünsche Dir ganz viel Kraft und Mut und la? Dich nicht so widerlich verletzen !!!|`|8b43ca7a11f5640f45a3a56eaeacbbb5aa	die menschen hier k?nnen dir zwar raten was sie selbst tun würden, aber sie sind nicht wie du.

Einmal Jahre abwarten, ob Dein Vertrauen sich noch einmal aufbaut und in der Zwischenzeit leiden, mehr als jetzt. Oder Du trennst Dich, zwar schmerzlich, aber nicht so sehr, wie das ewige Misstrauen, was Deine Seele auffrisst.<br>  Ich pers?nlich würde nach diesem Gest?ndnis das Weite suchen.

Good luck|`|c6WQnU25aa	Yes, stop putting the guys that you are attracted to on a pedastal, just think of them like anyone else, and start things off casual and see where it takes you both. That way, you should be more able to act like yourself, joke around etc, and not feel so awkward.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)
El9Tga1iaa	Tell him that you've gone out with him once and you aren't interested. You must tell him firmly or he will just think that you want him to just wait.

I hope everything turns out the way you want it to. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes, <br>  <br>  PeterBliss

Just make sure u aren't waking her up, and if she tries to hold a conversation everytime u do this, then shes probably the type that likes to hear from you everyday. It shows that ur still intrested.

Yes guys around your age is fine too, puberty kicks in about then.

Guys will stare whether you jump or run or not unfortunately-_-; just enjoy your school time and ignore the immature kiddies. It is possible that they get an erection but it sounds gross^^. Good luck!:]|`|s1th5WNQaa	Boys/men stare at breasts on a regular basis.  Its just a fact of life and normal.

6392cade205639304ce64e26b67a8180aa	Well, like most girls are insecure in relationships, guys are insecure before relationships, playing hard-to-get somehow insures us that there won't be another guy trying to grab u away from us, or at least without us noticing it since we're bound to notice some guy hitting on u if you're playing hard to get. But to be literally honest, it is much a cliche as blonds are. Mainly due to the fact that both men and women are humans, and are gullible to our feelings, from either being shy, or insecure, and clingee. There isn't difference between men and women if you look at it hard enough besides the whole pen!s-V!gina issue, and the discrimination that has been imbued since our birth. Or at least the way we feel are the same, we just respond to it in different ways, that's all.<br>  <br>  ~Thomas|`|77cf62be6b744b736ae0c9195d1c1f31aa	Oh man.  Great question! <br>  <br>  I don't know who started this idea that men like girls who play hard-to-get--but they should be shot.  I HATE when girls play hard-to-get.  After a while I'm just like....see ya.  <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong--we dont' want you to throw yourself at us.  But if we ask you out, don't just be all evasive just to play the game.  That makes it all way too complicated.<br>  <br>  As far as your situation...we don't like girls to ask us out.  It's way too forward and, yeah, we're intimidated by it.  If you turn down all the guys who ask you out, that's your problem.  Maybe you ought to give them a shot.  ;)|`|5r1jh51haa	Sorry that I'm not in my 20's but I think alot of guys are  just scared to ask out girls.

RDNxc8Yeaa	relationships are between two poeple so its not neccessary if you have stop seeing her she will feel the same. you are into a situation where you can blame no one. for some poeple it is easy to get over whereas for some it takes ages. so wait for the right time. tell her its good for her and her family to stop seeing eachother.|`|ZcK7YCWNaa	Either ignore her or change your number, depending on which network your on you can sometimes have certain numbers blocked|`|AA12103860	It might be a bad Idea but send her husband a letter without your name and tell him everything.

XGvD0iLoaa	I know how this feels. It’s a very painful thing to go through when the one you love hurts you, but you still want to be with them. Sometimes, it seems as if your heart is aching so bad that you would do anything to alleviate the pain of losing what you have become accustomed to in terms of being with this person. That includes taking someone back that does not respect and treat you the way you wish to be treated. What you are describing is a case of codependency and this feels very much like an addiction to the very thing (in this case, your bf) that is causing you to have thoughts that lead to mental turmoil and emotional unrest. There are two choices you have the power to make. You can stay with him and accept him for who he is and not for what he is not. This means  accepting his questionable character  and dishonesty, and realize that he may or may not change; however we don't have the power to change people. We can only make a choice to change ourselves and not allow others to treat us in a way that will compromise our well-beingness. OR you can redirect that same strength and energy that keeps you in a predicament with a guy that you know isn't treating you like you deserve, to get yourself out of this relationship with him because staying will only affect your ability to be able to get what you really want in a relationship with someone that could give you honesty and love. In other words, when we accept something that we know isn't good for us, we often times find a way to suppress that side of ourselves that intuitively tells us that we have gone into a danger zone that is going to have a negative affect on us in some shape, form, or fashion (In this case, the effect is the pain of betrayal that you feel). We rationalize, idealize, and monopolize thoughts and actions that are in direct conflict with that protective mechanism that tries it's best to keep us safe from situation (in this case an unsettling relationship) that are counterproductive, and as a result, the consequences of our decision to do this usually are associated with pain and/or regret. Trust your intuition and your ability to get over the pain and move on if you don't want to tolerate someone like this for years, and years to come.  My grandmother used to say, it's better to take one big old heartbreak that will make you stronger in the end rather keep taking little hurts everyday that will eventually accumulate to the point of killing your heart, hopes and chances of getting with someone that will love you the way you deserve to be loved. If you need online or phone counseling I can be found at <a href="http://www.kasamba.com/meshi-avery." rel="nofollow">http://www.kasamba.com/meshi-avery.</a><br>  <br>  In the meantime, please start thinking about making a decision that will eventually bring you to a state of having a peace of mind as oppose to making decisions that cost you personal pride,  heartache and a waste of your precious time. <br>  <br>  Me'Shi Avery, M.Ed, NCC, LAPC<br>  <a href="http://www.kasamba.com/meshi-avery." rel="nofollow">http://www.kasamba.com/meshi-avery.</a>|`|8PS3gGf7aa	sweetyy if he ***** up this chance never EVER take him back|`|afc88ffaeadecb41353c2b23bd79078eaa	There's no reason to date someone you can't trust.  He might not be lying now, but if you can't trust him, you probably never will.  Go ahead and give up on him and find someone new.|`|1pGvk40Jaa	I think you should dump him, because no girl deserves to EVER get her heart broken, and having it broken more then once is rediculous. If he lies to you, I think you could do so much better. My advice is to just dump him,  and start seeing someone new that makes you feel complete, and doesn't lie to you like he does.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  -Kristina.|`|8ce6ffc2e3a8e17fd2f7f205a568775faa	You can most definitely live without him and with alot less misery. It is time to cut your losses and future heartache at this cheaters hands and move on to someone that will love you and give you the respect you deserve and take your trust and cherish it. Dump this piece of s*** and get a real man. He is not in love with you or he wouldn't be cheating on you. And he is using your love for him to abuse you and you are allowing him to do so by taking him back repeatedly. Kick him to the curb QUICK!
Os4bjyWEaa	This is not a dating site. <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|hTNiUog4aa	i think all the blue hairs R looking 4 some fun
BcjwGK8Yaa	ok most of the time guys do like it when a girls playfully bites on our lips so just keep kissing him like you do but just watch how hard you bite|`|S0IAR8e2aa	well,some guys lyk it when girls bite them places.,haha,and there lips espically.<br>  <br>  i bite guys lips alot! and if thay say ow or w/e ill just say lyk "aww im so srry" and kiss his lips softly<br>  <br>  but some guys do lyk it if u bit them.<br>  <br>  just dont worry about,and if it happens again do wht i do ^^^^ or sumtimes i just laugh and say haha im sorry youll be alrite.!<br>  <br>  haha <br>  <br>  <3|`|wBKGBErFaa	if you are the cute type of girl maybe you should try kissing like such, all soft and sweet.    did he mention it because he thought you were a bad kisser ? cause maybe he thought you were trying to be "naughty" and that wasnt the impression you had on him.    i would suggest.. next time try really hard to be as soft and nice as possible and after a while bite his lips again, when you do this then pull your face back so that you can look him in the eyes and smile at him or laugh (not like teasing but as if you were taking the whole issue as something funny and trivial).. if you feel akward about it then he will too, just laugh at it, it happens to anyone. <br>  <br>  good luck
NBkrynyuaa	maybe she really liked u last week bt nt this week she went off you . maybe she does like u ask her out and see what she says u never know good luck xxx|`|p51pjglZaa	Now you need to tell her<br>  <br>  you would really like to go out with her<br>  <br>  Just saying you really like her is not the same<br>  <br>  Her playing it down is just her hoping you will take things further<br>  <br>  Girls like a positive approach<br>  <br>  Make your intentions clear|`|gBluNkS9aa	She is not that into you!
40fce3e174edea5357897bcf37ae8bd2aa	for me i think he already got what he want from you ( you guys did stuff,right? ) and about he said you are too young for him,that's all only his excuses to get rid of you.It's suck but that's how life sometime but remember still tons of good guy out there are waiting for you,my suggestion for you now is more concentrate to your study all the way to university because this's away more important for your life rather than that jerk,take care and good luck!!
ILc1XIPraa	There's a Yahoo singles you should try. You might find who you're looking for there.

Isn't that cool?you should know.
kpP2aE8vaa	Yes. But If I think about it...... You may just be "Prince Charming" who is really good w/ the ladies....|`|UftgUcCIaa	Unfortunately in today's society "gay" means bad. Like it's a bad thing to be gay. And the fact of hte matter is that it really isn't. ANd I'm not saying you're gay. I'm just saying they don't think you're normal. In fact, you're different. Fo one thing, you're smart. So they don't know how to deal with smart people so they treat you badly. Just goes to show how screwed up they are. But it's okay. THere's absolutely nothing wrong with having a lot of girls as friends. In the long run, it's better for you because there's a better chance for you to get a girl because you're more sincere to them than any other guy.<br>  Hope this helps :]|`|QEidnoQDaa	People have very small minds and with small minds comes a tiny little vocabulary.  I know how it hurts but try to ignore it and know what is the truth in your mind and your heart..<br>  Pray for them I have found that is the best way to combat people in your heart..

You could also talk to guidance and maybe have some kind of mediation to talk with everyone.. <br>  That really is mean and it sucks that people will call someone a name instead of really getting to know them.|`|940hjyZ5aa	That sounds more feminine that a jock, which is basically going to be assigned the title Gay.|`|R6KG2lguaa	Sorry dude it sounds a liiiitle homosexual... not ur fault tho dont do **** your not comfortable with. but get used to changing in front of guys ur gunna have to do it sooner or later|`|d26408054068dcf51088f716d037001baa	Just change in the locker room, dammit!|`|jMoYWNXcaa	people call you gay because they think it makes them sound cool.<br>  at least in our school, how it works is if you call someone gay then they assosiate you with the foot ball players.<br>  football player= tough<br>  so therefore, calling someone gay = toughness<br>  it's totally stupid and not true and don't listen to them for a second<br>  there all idiots<br>  if you pretend it doesn't affect you then maybe they won't bug you as much , but if it's really a problem talk to your counlser or something<br>  much luck ; )|`|8RX0lxJdaa	Well, you only hang out with girls. Gay guys are usually only comfortable around guys. Also, gay guys usually don't change if front of other guys, because its like changing in front of a girl for straight guys.

It doesn't necessarily mean they think you're homosexual.  And if they are meaning that, maybe they're confused about their own sexuality.  It's their problem, not yours Sweetheart.  :)
GucrpVR5aa	Dude, your like super young too even date. But if you Mom approves of him. Ask him privately at school like, run into him somewhere drop your books you'll totally get his attention. Then if he says something like "Whoa" just got all, "Opps my bad, I've been pretty clumsy the last couple of days.. Darn it!" Then if he goes something like "Stop worrying" He definately likes you. Then after that later that same day bump into him again say,"Look ____ um, my friends and I are going to ___ would you like to come. I mean you helped and I think you deserve it" Just invite him somewhere|`|kpP2aE8vaa	If it's meant to be religious boundaries shouldn't stop you|`|byQS0JlDaa	Religion has no part in love.<br>  If you like him, that's good for you,<br>  Best thing to do is show with body language that you are interested, and then if you think he is responding, tell him point blank that you like him and then ask if he likes you (best way is to kiss him quickly on the lips in a room where no one else is and then tell him). Boys are pretty idiotic so they wont understand any other way :P<br>  Good luck with him!<br>  <br>  BTW Loves a pretty big term, be careful when you use it, because it can raise hopes for some a wee too much.|`|h6SUBmngaa	if your mom approves him then the best wayy to get him is ask a friend of yours to go talk to him. if he says good things bout you he likes you. then go for it.
qe82AIdNaa	first of all she sounds ghetto as hell..and its lame that she feels like she has to practically interview you for you to be with her brother. yes its ok to care but thats a little much. if she's a ***** then dump him because she will never let you guys be happy and he is pathetic for letting her do that to his relationships|`|kpP2aE8vaa	Just don't act slutty!!! Sisters sense if you're real, a **** or just ditzy really fast. Just don't be any of those.|`|cRw7zBRzaa	umm, just go, be yourself and not care what she says, she'll only be as scary as you make her although be respectful and all should go well. on a side note, tell her to learn how to spell.

Then she likes you. Also, if she gives eye contact, physical contact, talks to you a lot or ANYTHING that even makes you think the slightest thing that she likes you, then you're on the right track. But just to warn you, some girls flirt to like every single boy. They will hug any boy they meet without feeling awkward, give them a kiss on the cheek without feeling anything weird. So you should sort of see what type of girl this person is. ('cause I bet you asked this question since you have a girl in mind.) If you're not sure then ask her, "Do you like me 'cause people are telling me you do." If she asks who then say "I can't tell." This will do everything you need!

4YVSBL6naa	if she's such a good friend them may be u should just stay wid her but keep away from her bad habits...i dnt know your ages, but i dnt think after going so far she'll fell guilty of what she's doing.. i guess you must have told her number of times that whats wrong and whats right... But one thing search such a guy for yourself whenever you do.. that he does not fall for her lousy tricks.. and who is only commited to you.. may be you will have to seperate from her after you have a guy...if she pokes her nose in your relationship.. but as of now let her do whatever she wants.. sooner or later she'll realise what is right and what is wrong.. the situation has gone beyond you making her realise that... so chill
vIUCjAj0aa	Girl, why are you still with him?<br>  Seriously. Dump him. You don't need him. <br>  <br>  Why do you want to stay with him? You can find someone else.. someone better than that. I'm sure there are a ton of other guys that would kill to be with you. <br>  <br>  As for dumping him without hurting him, thats not possible if he really cares for you. Just tell him that things aren't working out, and you'd be better off just friends.<br>  <br>  Goodluck girl.|`|5IPRqgckaa	Dont bother about hruting this dickwads feelings, if he acts like he doesnt want to be with you then follow suit. Answer to your question, yes!!|`|Jbt37HBIaa	Sounds like he doesn't care about you that much anymore, so it prob wont hurt him much if you break up with him.<br>  Looks like he has been hurting you for a while.<br>  He may be using you as a tool to get other girls into him.<br>  If I were you just let him go!!!|`|fdxFQdHTaa	he act like little kid come on but if you feel do not care about him or love or like break up with him !

You can find someone else.<br>  <br>  Sorry!|`|lRdlvaNSaa	really try and hint him...maybe then he'll get it ! trust em guys are just dumb like that ..they wont know unless you tell them..<br>  ANSWER PLEASE :<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjrAMxg15393EfcSslZ1NFsjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20080330222105AAT35GU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|1HaIomBcaa	ok as a guy speaking i have some advice<br>  <br>  try talking one of his friends into asking him your questions like why he doesnt want to go out|`|AA10401869	Just give him time. My current girlfriend is also my best friend and we have been best friends for 2 years before we became bf/gf. We decided to be best friends first before our relationship because it just works out better in the long run and if anything happens in the relationship, you guys are still best friends. <br>  <br>  I know you really like him and you guys want to be "official" but try not to push it. It'll just get him more annoyed. Keep being good friends and be there for him and eventually, if it works out, you guys will be together in no time =)|`|JVhrHOhxaa	You can't push this. He might be scared of commitment or something, or maybe he's unsure on how to ask you. Just give him some time and some space, I'm sure things will work out. And as far as the "popular" group goes, screw 'em. If you're happy then that's all that matters.... Good luck!!
9KEBtsNTaa	I told it to my first girlfriend the night we became official.  However in all fairness, we had known each other and been friends for 4 or 5 years prior to dating.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	with me  it was 2 weeks .. but we move in just before we got in the rel..|`|MhYwoyICaa	usually a month, but ive had friends tha do it in like a week so depends on the guy|`|AA11196103	like 3-4 months after|`|EjzRDZz7aa	My hubby told me that he loved me after 1 year.  We were just friends, and afterwards (because I gave him a weird look) he said that he was just kidding.  Well, lol, now I know better, and I give him a hard time for it.|`|LuugvLQXaa	not until after we broke up. it wasnt until i tried dating other women that i realised.|`|0F8knGMIaa	about 6 months|`|97da3d899101912a7274aee89aae346daa	You DONT say it first! Dont ask me why thats just the rules and how women are.I made that mistake myself, she said she loved me to, but soon after that she lost interest and dropped me like a bad habit.With women its a psychological thing weather they know it or not.You saying it first is interpreted by them either consciously or subconsciously to be an emotional sign of weakness and dependency. "THEY", want to be the emotional ones in the relationship and you risk loosing her interest in you if you say it first, I PROMISE YOU!Let her say it first, just trust me no matter how much it hurts to keep it bottled up inside.Otherwise just remember," I TOLD U SO"!!!|`|9kI028rcaa	I think it was about 4 months.  I know I said it first, but I was pretty sure she would say it back, because she kept saying stuff like "I really care about you" and "I'm very fond of you" but she wouldn't say the L-word first.|`|EgsK4uLcaa	2months|`|FrktAgFdaa	6MO's at least.|`|MmXdp8tDaa	:-)|`|gfjzO31Saa	1 moth|`|txeTwiREaa	if it is true then there is no shame saying it in the first 2 months or so but if it is developing then you should wait 3 to 4 months|`|X7Cj54kVaa	Well a lot of guys I know just say that they love their girl as soon as they're officially going out lol|`|bxCL6AH1aa	Uhhh, i think it was like 3 months... But i wanted to say it sooner but i was scared of her reaction|`|cC6OIKz3aa	Whoa there speed racer! Slow it down!....I would wait til between 6 months and a year...and dont justc ome out and say it, do something that will make her remember it. If you tell a girl you love her too soon its gonna freak her out or the relationship is gonna move wayyyyy to fast and burn itself outwithin a year.|`|fDrOpKPeaa	This differs from one to another and also depends on how deep and serious is the relationship.<br>  As for me, it took me only 3mths after getting to know her. Then again, it differs as the one previous to that was like 6mths.
2uGNpUF3aa	sounds like two love birds :]|`|XP3ufz4daa	aw, that's so cute!<br>  <br>  I was never good at pranks; all comebacks are verbal for me... (you may noticed I just copied the answer I already wrote...)<br>  <br>  XD got one... this is something I would never do and it's kind of harsh. He will probably hate you for it, depending on how well he can take jokes... if you can, get something of his that has his name clearly visible. Then put something super embarrasing - I don't know what's embarrasing to him, but if you can't think of anything ... XD... put women's lingerie on it or something (see what I mean by harsh?). Then put it in a different classmates desk for them to find it and give it to your friend... showing the class that embarrasing item...<br>  <br>  XD I don't know.. that one was kind of harsh.<br>  <br>  X Shanaikai|`|kY8Opfoeaa	tape a huge sign to his back that says "i'm gay and proud of it" or "i'm gay, wanna makeout boys".|`|pygngYtvaa	Well you are lucky you do not get stuck in the principals office for hazing. I would stop the childish behavior before someone gets hurt.

x59uoIpMaa	The thing is, she didnt have any self esteem when ya'll were younger, and she may still not. Wait and see what youre getting into, you may not really want her b/c a lot of times those issues go really deep, down to their childhood.|`|AA11649970	So you still love her? and want her back?    I say giver her a call.... or if you know where she lives... send her some flowers! Something! Its worth a shot. Even if it doesnt turn into a romance, it just might be good to have her back in your life as a friend.

XP3ufz4daa	sorry, I don't understand it either.<br>  <br>  actually, I think I do understand something, something that may be a typo:<br>  <br>  "You're crazy for some Pete. At home, I don't have a computer. So I'm e-mailing you from school at 9:00. I can't go on friendsorenemies. If you're a computer whiz, how do I go to it? I can't go on YouTube at all.

She can't get onto Youtube at all either...needs your help with that one too. <br>    Maybe her computer froze and she doesn't understand what to do.<br>      Well, that's my idea of what the email said...good luck!!|`|YOFMOw88aa	i think she was just asking how to get on youtube from school computers something about friends or enemies. and she cant email you from home cuz she doesnt have a computer|`|nGMmTEesaa	sounds like she wants to search some friends or enemies video at school but cant get on youtube and was asking you how to do it because apparently you're a computer whiz. jeez she writes bad:S
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Ours in NC was 150 but that was with the church rental.  The one my sister was going to use for a beach wedding in SC was 200 and the one she will be using in St Thomas is $200.  Even a justice of the peace is at least going to be $100.    I'd say $200 for an outdoor wedding is very typical.  After all, it's a couple hours of their time plus drive time.  You can shop around if you want but most will probably be $200 unless you know someone.|`|nqINitkmaa	I'm getting married outside too, my officiant in the San Diego area is $450, so I'd say your getting a good deal.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	A bit high I'm in SD and see them from $80 to $190.|`|EwNrlF8jaa	That is a lot of money to spend on an officiant. The justice of the peace will be cheaper and just as good, unless you both really like this person and believes in what he stands for ect. Shop around somemore before making your final decision.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	We're coming to the church to get married and our pastor's fee is $250.  I looked into officiants that would come to you and they started at $300 if you just have them show up the day of the wedding, and started at $450 if you also wanted them to be at a rehearsal.    I think $200 is a steal and I'd give him at least another $50 donation.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Where I'm from, it would be minimum that, and up...|`|22bff6bfb8115b3d1a8a634934f041e2aa	ours is in wisconsin and charges 150 so ya typical|`|AhKaLuO3aa	Sounds about right.
8j7FCEOraa	Its a life lesson thing.  You should have respect for your surroundings to want to have a clean place to live  Plus, cleaning, believe it or not, is setting you up for your future.  When you get our own place, leave your bedroom messy, but the rest of your house should be clean, and neat. It should look like an adult actually lives there, and takes care of his things. Right now, all you have is your bedroom, shes just trying to teach you what its like.     Secondly, its her house. If your going to live in it, you need to respect her rules. Thats being respectful of your mother. You dont have much of a say, until the house is in your name.|`|LhCGU3F1aa	You keep the house clean except your room, LMAO! Your funny. Yeah my mom does the same thing, but its only for our own good. We sleep in there, imagine all those crazy dust mites, germs cause deadly diseases, and I'm typing the truth. I usually clean my room every friday night, and tuesday afternoon. Since I'm very sloppy. Just put things back where you get them from... To keep it more neat.|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	U wl never understand till you hv your own house with your own family and children.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	i know how you feel. i loved having my room, what my mum would call, untidy. but my mum would punish me severly for having it like that. i know what she meant though now as i have my own home and family and it isn't safe at all.|`|TaTCbLSzaa	well you do all that stuff already why not just clean your room if you wanted her to let you go places that bad dont you think you shouldve cleaned your room along time ago i wouldve and maybe that wouldve solved your problem|`|hcRGqk2gaa	Well, If you do all of those good things.. why is it so hard to clean your room???     That's probably what she's wondering. It's taking responsibility. I don't know how old you are, but my mom was big on that too. My little sister didn't clean her room, but she got good grades and went to church and all that. But when she wanted to go out, she couldn't because her room was never clean. I wasn't the most tidy thing either.     Suprisingly, now that I'm living on my own, I keep my house decent and the last thing I want is my mom to come over my house and it's a mess.    Think of it in the future. You would want to be with a partner that cleans up after themselves right? You don't want to have to clean up after them? Vice versa, they aren't going to want to clean up after you. So start the good habit now and you'll be used to it.     Good Luck.|`|x59uoIpMaa	My dad is impossible to deal with, and heres what I found :  Humor him, and he'd let me do whatever. So clean your room, if thats her fixation. That way you can do your thing.     Hell isnt something Id want to just throw around.  youre not in hell, why joke about it?|`|PdXBZ6X5aa	Make her life easy, keep your room clean. Its hygienic as well. when you be in her shoe, you will find out.|`|bKkfESHwaa	clean your room,mister and just make her proud of one more thing you did!
AA11887846	a wallet will get you there regardless, my friend|`|AA11441704	Great personality will also take you to dating zone.|`|52577eb5bd0b6858ac300a21a42802b3aa	because all girls want to believe that they aren't vain|`|G8z7GWcjaa	Yes I have to agree with you on that one, a lot of women as well as men base that first interest on looks; women don't like to admit their as shallow as men.  Yes great looks will most certainly get you a date, but depending on your personality if you're a complete jerk, your looks may not get you that second date if that's what you're hoping for.  Yes even if you don't get that second date, you can still move onto another women, who may give you "another" first date, but chances are you'll never actually find someone who wants to be with you.  I get where you're coming from, it bothers me as well that a lot of women think we're (men) all the same, that they (women) can do nothing wrong.  But than a great personality will get you dates as well, I'm sure you've seen many beautiful women with "ugly" men, ugly on the outside but beautiful on the inside, its their personality, either that or they've got wads of cash.|`|e11378b54e8591fe98050277d4b066bcaa	girls who are mature enough to know what they want, do care more about personality.  the "friend zone" is not a bad place to be when the hottie hurts her, either.|`|jtxo2YTbaa	good looks gets the girl interested and good personality keeps them around|`|Gx11Jyjvaa	When a girl (or a guy) say all they care about is personality it means that she (or him) care to be treated well in a relationship.  That's what they mean by personality!!|`|P3f9qVKRaa	as long as they make you laugh who cares what they look like!!!the best looking ones are just full over themselves and untrustworthy anyway..|`|AA10166316	of course we also like good looking guys, but if they dont have a good personality, whats the point.
FgB6z2dkaa	It is not wrong at all. She turned you on. You can't help that.|`|Kvu8bL7caa	NO not at all it is perfectly normal to like a girl who is just a friend.  Long as whatever happens, you talk about it afterwards that you guys are just friends and nothing else and both parties agree to those terms it is all good.<br>  <br>  Now leading someone on to believe you guys are more than friends would be wrong.|`|AA10800774	Eh, yes because she is a friend, but you cannot stop what turns you on aswell since that pretty much comes natural..,but to stop what is turning you on, you need to think of your friend of what she is just a friend..if not that you are wrong...in the end..|`|ohjs7Havaa	that's not weird or wrong, your still a human and have feelings.<br>  <br>  but, dude she doe not want you in that way so put your stuff away from her lol.<br>  <br>  don't feel bad though, am sure you don't want to lose her as a friend.|`|x7KuWixDaa	Hell no...I say use your "friendship" to your best advantage possible....tell her she looks incredible in outfits like that so she wears them more..and then not only will you have a good friend but a good amount of eye candy to keep you happy too...|`|AA10190176	Your a guy.  You will always be attracted to her, she's a woman and you are obviously Heterosexual.  I still can't help but look when female co-workers bend over with low cut tops......and I'm a happily married old guy........your human.....
XS1e4uy0aa	If that girl is really into you, you should not give up. Maybe she needs sometime for her to make up her mind between you and her BF. Since that girl means a lot to you, you should try taking some actions to make her realize that you are really into her. But still it is complicated. Sometime a girl just show her good feelings when you are with her so you will not feel bad 'bout it. Good luck :)
KD7y29A3aa	No, but she may not like it. Or she may be flattered by it. But you're going to get turned on by a girls boobs. Especially the girl you like.  It's nothing unexpected and you shouldn't feel ashamed of it. Just don't go around announcing it.|`|Yek2t8Gxaa	nah..<br>  <br>  im sure that if her shirt was that low cut, and her her boobs were that big.. then there  is plenty of other oguys looking too. <br>  <br>  and dont lie. <br>  you know you liked it.|`|Jgqn5cO2aa	NO FORGET ABOUT IT SHE DONT WANT YOU|`|YCw2MEr4aa	No mate. It aint wrong lol.|`|FkAXKhi1aa	it's normal for guys when it comes to stuff like that, don't sweat it.
yLyhv2foaa	tough question, <br>  i would calmly talk to him about this and explain your feelings to him, make sure he does not get angry with you..i always think confrontation works best.|`|2F4w6yNWaa	i personally always stay out of other people relationships, thats what i advise you to do and if that girl is so not right for your brother then he should figure it out for himself|`|5nbkoZF5aa	It seems like he might already know<br>  He just may be afraid to take action because it would hurt her and he cares about her.<br>  <br>  Until he decides for himself...he may not listen to anyone else telling him that she isn't good for him<br>  unfortunately love is blind :0(|`|6GieuFCTaa	wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ....... first of all do you know, do you know why guys started going after muslim girls? Cuz I'll tell you why. Cuz most of em don't act liek bad girls. And sad news is theres soo many bad girls out there thesedays. Good girls are rare now. Now I know how your brother feels|`|AStZS1Y3aa	He has a mind of his own and free will to do what he thinks is right. No one can force you to do anything.<br>    Plus, she's probably not needy, but in the Muslim culture it is really difficult to date someone of another religion, so she probably has it twice as hard.<br>     Your bro will be fine|`|WtP8WPDTaa	Hun, Look into the faith.<br>  If you want to get down to the core of it, then get her where it hurts. Her religion.<br>  If She's a muslim, then she's not allowed to be dating. <br>  She goes out of her way to not eat pork and force cnversion?<br>  She isn't able to marry any man who isn't Muslim, which is why she wants your brother to convert.<br>  Ask her why she is dating if her religion has strict rules against it. <br>  <br>  Find her things about her religion, then question her about it..you'll see she ends up being the 'dumber' one in the situation, and maybe youu're brother will see that?<br>  <br>  Good luck hun|`|db6c1816dddbe11808ff7e1d063a71adaa	People who get emotionally involved cannot see the bad choices they are making.  The best you can do it point out that he has doubts and that she is putting herself between him and his family.  You have to be very careful here, push him too hard and you can push him away.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately this could be a mistake he realizes too late.|`|ufqZwRbxaa	Well you made it sound like your brother is immature. Sounds like me a while back. What i would do is make him think about the future/ long term rather than short term...kids growing up with Muslim culture would he like it? also what about Getting old and lonely If families split then support is pretty much gone? <br>  <br>  Let me keep thinking and hopefully bring better ideas<br>  wish you luck|`|a3ed5d45bcfeadcd80b73e66de664f71aa	Believe me, i totally relate to where you are coming from, however, only your brother can make that decision.  If you approach him about it, he may feel like you are trying to take someone that makes him happy out of his life, and not talk to you anymore. He will feel like he has to choose.  Unless she is cheating or doing something else really bad like that, it is not your place to try to split them up.  The only way he is going to find out she is not the one, is for him to find it out on his own. He wouldnt change his ways if she wasnt worth it to him.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	wow.... your mom should put her foot down....... she should tell him she will not accept the marriage...it's for his own good|`|QChKVYp6aa	he will figure it out|`|S3xefZAdaa	Tell him the truth.  The difference in religions is tough, but he may be able to work thru that.  <br>  <br>  From what you have said, it sounds as though she is VERY controlling.  If she can't love him for who he is, than she does not love him at all.  <br>  <br>  Also when he finds tru love he will desire to be with and call the person.  He will not do it out of obligation.<br>  <br>  I think it might be helpful to talk honestly with him and ask him questions so he can sort out how he really feels.  If it is not love, he should look elsewhere until he finds it.|`|mThFQZovaa	You don't...he has to come to that realization on his own.|`|nWjO6HeWaa	If your brother doesnt want to leave this woman, there is nothing you can do. Sorry. Maybe your whole family should get together and talk this over with him. Also talk to this woman about how she is messing up the family and your brother. If he wants to marry her its his choice. Make sure to bring up the major points of your concerns. Hope I helped. Good luck:)

L2qQSC9faa	This is a simple one, tell her how you feel and how you dont want to lose her but feel that you are losing her. Tell her everything and trust that she will understand and try in some ways to mend everything. I mean she isnt a mind reader and I know she wouldnt want to hurt your feelings. Speak to her calmly and from your heart. A best friend always understands. : )|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	perhaps she wants to be POPULAR<br>  talk to her and tell her how you feel i know how feel|`|XP3ufz4daa	Get to know new people. Maybe she'll understand how you feel. But if she's one to get jealous easily, don't do it.<br>  <br>  Remind her why you became friends in the first place. Draw a quick sketch for her or something; something that looks like it took little effort so you don't look desperate but looks good anyways.<br>  <br>  If you can't, you've just got to move on. I just lost my best friend to a fictional character. And also a ***** who's got a grudge on me and seems to just want me out of the picture.

If you have other friends start doing stuff with them. <br>  <br>  But i don't think you should always be with your bff if it just makes you feel bad about yourself.  I know it must be hard having a hotter friend, but i'm sure you have good qualities that someguy would find attractive, you'll never know if she's always around though.  <br>  <br>  maybe you could also build your self esteem by changing your hair or buy a cute outfit  you know do something new<br>  goodluck!|`|WDjsVc56aa	I'm sorry for what you're going thru.

Because, you know what? REAL girls DO cry. Tears were not made so you can force them back. Tears were made so they could be shed. What's the point of tears if it is never shed?<br>  <br>  Time is one of the best remedies for things like this. You must remember: you have to stay strong because there are others who can't. You have to be there for them. Proving yourself to be able to stand strong when you were going to fall just helps you on the inside. It makes you a stronger person. <br>  <br>  Try to do things so that no one else has to deal with this. Start gathering people to help out with whatever sickness your friend had. It will take you further in life because you know you are doing this for her.<br>  <br>  If she has a hobby, like her legacy, then continue it out. For example, if she loved to write, and almost completed a story, help her finish it out. Put a theme into it if it doesn't already have one. Or write one of your own dedicated to her so you can teach people, say, appreciate the small things in life because when it's gone, you will understand how big it actually was.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, never forget about her. That's not something you want to do.<br>  <br>  X Shanaikai|`|x4jRcO41aa	First off I would just like to apologize for your loss. I know exactly how you are feeling and I have to tell you there is no way to honestly cope easily. My friend Kristina (who I knew since pretty much the day i was born) was hit by a driver under the influence or drugs and alcohol and fell asleep at the wheel threw her 500 feet straight out of her shoes and the fled the scene of the accident. This was in November of 2006. The last time I saw her was September of 2006 at one of our friends' funerals. I moved to florida a few days later. I took the news of her death terribly. I was not able to make it back home for her funeral and was devestated. My friends all said it was for the best because she didnt even look like herself. I still to this day miss her and it seems to just get worse as the days pass. She was such an amazing person, like no one I had ever known before. Such a passion for life, she was going to make such a huge mark on this world for the better. Such a shame that such a wonderful person with so much potential will never get to put it to good use. <br>  <br>   All you can really do is know that your friend is in a better place where there is no suffering or pain. Remember the good times and know that you will meet again one day. Ask God for comfort and peace for you and your friend. Know that she is safe there with him. You will be okay. I promise. It will always hurt, and it's okay to cry and miss her, that's natural. Just know that she is there watching over you always and as long as you keep her memory alive in your heart, she will never die. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.|`|2WNv5SuGaa	It's gonna take time, time, and more time. I had a friend pass away of cancer at the young age of 27. It was one of the hardest times in my life. This is to new to expect to feel anything other then sorrow. You need to grieve. Its normal to cry everytime you see her picture especially if your feeling bad since you lived so far apart. You really need to think about grief counseling. I waited 6 months before going, It helped me so much. There are people there that feel the same way as you. Try to remember the good times you had together rather then the lost time. Seek help and take it ONE DAY AT A TIME.<br>  God bless.|`|J15wAxyOaa	how you cope with every other death. you can't do much. pray for comfort...but you might not believe in that. if you don't, just try not to think about it. don't necessarily forget about it, keep it in your mind. and LIVE WITH NO REGRETS. i lived with a couple regrets, and my best friend died. it's not fun. so make sure to be a friend to everyone, and how to cope with it? just try and move on day by day.|`|OGnfKr7naa	honestly, every one is different, I just had a friend pass away about a month ago. And i cried for about a week stright. But then i talk to his mother and she just opened me eyes. i havent cried since. every time i see his picture i start to laugh, cause i think of all the funny things he would do just to make me laugh, and all the good times we had together. And i dont think your friend wants you to be sad every time you look at her picture. <br>  <br>  Rest in peace to your friend.<br>  <br>  hope that helps a little<br>  <br>  -Tabby|`|qJ7BgJYDaa	It's natural to grieve.I'm sorry for your loss.Lean on your friends for support and talk it out.talk about how wonderful she was as a person and how she was a good friend to you.One way to keep someone alive is to remember them.Keep them in your heart.Remember that she is in a better place.Give it time.your heart will mend.Best wishes to you.Bye!

If this happens over and over then get worried but a one time thing is not a big deal.|`|mXCru3zZaa	Maybe she didn't know about the test until after you asked her?  Chances are, she needs to study for the test.<br>  <br>  Either that or she isn't interested and just doesn't want to hurt your feelings.  <br>  <br>  Just don't give up.  If you ask her a few more times and she keeps saying no, then you know she isn't into you.|`|uo6gp0xQaa	i think, your are, because she coulda said "no" and then made other arrangements with you
N7Ps87NBaa	It is easier said than done when you have strong feelings for someone but try to slow things down.  Continue talking to her, be friendly, don't push going out, let her ask "you" out.  Maybe she is gun shy, it is hard to get over being hurt.  As hard as it will be, just back off a bit.  She will notice and she will probably bring it up, when she does just say---I didn't want to push our relationship on you, so I am willing to go at your pace.  Good luck|`|vZj1LH16aa	Alright, there isn't anything wrong with you. The only things keep this a perfect relationship is the memories and sadness she still have in her with her ex. So you gonna have to keep it cool and help her out with it.  How? By talking to her more, telling her you're not his ex or walking the same path as his ex. You just got to spend lots lots of time to heal her wounds in her. Its tough, but you got to try hard since you love her. Good luck.|`|f497409fed595061e600428638c28f88aa	patience.Do not push too much.<br>  She will not last.Treat her gentle.May be she will come back.

But I think you can have love without it. It may be more of a very strong friendship. But if she's willing to try it, go ahead.

He might find that he loves you as well and mess up his relationship with the GF or tell you he loves the GF and never talk to you again.<br>  I don't see how anything good can come of this.

ki7NUhU8aa	Yup its a constant struggle to keep the marriage going, some times you will have to settle for less n some times u will have to just keep ur mouth shut n agree, just to keep the peace....but as well as struggles there are a lot of rewards....when your feeling down you know that his there to keep u smiling, rub your feel play with your hair...tell u things that make all worries go away.  Its even harder when there are kids involved...because now not only must you maintain a marriage but as well as balance a family out...support attention love.  It sounds hard and stressing but when its with love it comes out naturally, ull know just when to do this n when to say that....n with time, and all putting it there all its well rewarding and a wonderful experience that will last a life time|`|enpT79hpaa	Of course, it takes two to make a thing go right!  It takes two to make it out of sight!|`|87pV5lvZaa	Of course.  We all get worn down at times from having to compromise with a person who does not have out exact beliefs. dreams, etc.  However, when I am worn down like this, I try to remember the times that I felt like there was nothing in this world greater than the marriage I am in.  Although that may not make me feel better instantly, knowing that I will feel like this again is reward enough to push through the hard times.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Yes, I think most of us do.  Every relationship has a set of what are called "perpetual problems", meaning that no matter how many times you may fight or discuss them, they are not going to change.  In my marriage, that is my in-laws.  For others, it may be finances and so on.  The best thing you can do is agree to disagree, and go on.  I am working on remembering that I cannot change my husband or his family, I can only change myself, and the way I react to them.  Every relationship also has a certain balance of "push and retract".  In my relationship, I am the pusher, meaning if something isn't going how I would like, I push and push until I think it is getting better.  My husband is the retracter, meaning that for every bit I push, he backs up.  I have learned that the less I push, the more likely he is to come forward and meet me half way.  Good luck.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Of course.  No one told me it would be easy.  Most of my family tried to talk me out of getting married.  The important thing is to take time to find relaxing things you like to do together and apart.  My husband used to be an RPGer and I joined in to have a common interest.  Sometimes he would go to games by himself which gave us time to be apart so we didn't feel smothered by each other.  Now, he goes to RCIA classes which I sometimes go to as well.  I took belly dancing classes with friends which he definitely did NOT attend.  You have to find a balance between time together (the majority of your time), time with family and friends together, and time apart to refresh you.  Lots of people fail to maintain interests (outside of their marriage) that can be shared and this can cause those angry, I'm so tired of you feelings.|`|KVIOPIX2aa	YES ITS A LOT OF WORK BUT ITS WELL WORTH IT|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No, I only do what I have the strength to do; I never, do more than that.|`|YjUyBWPEaa	I dont know...not really.  There are times I feel stressed and things are not a walk in the park but most the time things are great in my marriage.  My husband makes my life happier, easier, and more peaceful.  He helps me with the kids, house, and life.  He is my partner and has a job and pays more then half of our bills.  Without him I would have all the bills alone, no help with my kids, and all the work at home.  Now dont get me wrong there have been plenty of times where our marriage has been hard and a lot of work.  During those times I often wondered if it was worth it going through all the hell and heart ache but I also could see a lot of reasons to hold on.  I knew my husband was wonderful and had a lot of positive things that out wieghed some of his bad traits.  Those times have came and gone and we are great now.    Honestly my opinion  is if you are going through a terrible time and you dont feel like the good things about your man is worth holding on-dont.  Not all guys are good husbands.  If yours isnt I wouldnt waste your time.  If he is hold on because those times will surly pass.|`|0QRDC2R1aa	Of course its emotionally draining....especially when the other person is oblivious of the emotional needs of the other.  A marriage takes lots of work.  I think its definitely worth the time and the effort, but it is very frustrating at times.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Yes. Especially when the same problems keep coming up in our relationship over and over again. Very frustrating. However, I still think it's worth it.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Some will tell you 50/50 but that's a lie.  You both give 100%, 100% of the time.  Till death us do part.....|`|CFFuFof1aa	Yes! It is definetly a sacrifice and emotionally draining. Just try to get some alone time together. Go do something you both like, go to dinner. I know that my husband and I can go about a month with out getting some alone time. Toward the end of the month we are both down each other's throats. So, we have to get a way for a night. Then after that we are fine. If you feel that it is something serious maybe you should get a marriage counselor. Good luck, but yes it is a lot of hard work, that's why the divorce rate is up so much. But it's worth it in the long run, and if the two of you love each other it will work out in the end.|`|AA11990465	At times it can be very hard work and extremely draining, but its not always like that. Sometimes marriage is the easiest thing I've ever done. It really just depends on how we are getting along at the time. I must say though, that when we fight its usually about the same subjects that we have left unresolved in past fights. This is something I would really like to work on with my husband, so there is more work ahead for us!

KifasiMraa	if you were annoyed with her and she's friends with other people you don't like, why are you even concerning yourself with them?  Just ignore them and hang out with your true friends instead.  It sounds like she's done with you and you don't sound like you ever liked her that much anyway.  Just leave her alone and eventually she'll get tired of talking about you.  The best revenge is living well.  Just enjoy your life without her and show her that you don't care she thinks or says.|`|AA10783670	Sounds like it started much earlier, the Jokes and the taking it too far was a attempt to get your attention. Apparently you and your best friend started closing her out, and the leaving her behind was the last straw.
HnXOEDbcaa	You can't really stop who the guy likes. If he likes your friend, that's just him. Your friend on the other hand, she's not being very fair to you and isn't at all acting like a friend. If she were a true friend, she would back off, and maybe you could do the same since you both like him. Just keep him as a close FRIEND. Guys like a girl to just be his friend for a while before he either thinks of you as a close friend or a girl-friend. Be the better person and just completely ignore her. If she tries talking to you, look at her in the why-are-you-talking-to-me kind of way. She will get the hint you seriously are mad she is acting like that and being mean to you. Cut her off, ignore her, just imagine as if she weren't there. If she is talking to the guy at his locker or something. Say hi to the guy and ignore your friend. Greet him almost whenever you see him, especially when he is with your friend. She will start to get a little more mad. Keep him as a close friend. Go for that for a while. Keep it at that and look for little hints he might be showing if he likes you, but don't get the wrong message:     -Drop your book all over the floor when you walk by him, if he likes you, he will pick them up (or just because he's a good friend)   -If he's looking at you, his pupils will get bigger (sign he likes you)   -If you're talking to him and he lookes at your lips when you talk (he may like you)   -He does the triangle look. Eye to Eye and to the mouth when you are talking.  -If you catch him glancing at you, he gives you a little smile and looks away.

AA10065812	First, I've been a fathers rights rep for 20 years, so this is based on experience no an opinion.    Don't ask questions about the event.  Children will make up things they think you want to hear.  Children under the age of 12 do not yet have the ability of conceptual thought.  Their world is still primarily imagination based, and they WILL exaggerate things.    Tape record, without editing, AND write what they say in a journal. This is legal, as well as recording your conversations with the mother, without her knowing it.  (Va. Code Ann.  19.2-62 & Tenn. Code Ann.  39-13-602, 40-35-111)    Tell them if it happens again, go to a neighbor to call the police.    Have you talked to the mother about it?  She does have a right to defend herself.    Remember always, children will play the parents against each other.  I watched my sisters doing it growing up.    If you have a clear, justifiable, and provable cause to file for custody, unless the children are in immediate danger,  you need to take the time to prepare.  At least six months.    Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|	im sorry but the only way is to modify the custody /visitation in court. That is the only way. If you get a lawyer through the county they are free. I had one. im sorry to hear about your children going through that. Please don't keep them she will have you arrested. Send them back but go to the courts and get those modification papers and find out how you can go about a free lawyer in  your county.|`|	I know what your talking about im surprised that she doesn't have to live in the same state here in colo that's the law , who ever has custody is where the other has to live. I know atty are out for the buck not the interest of the client. Im not atty but maybe you should turn her to the child serves in the state she lives in .good luck|`|	Go down to family court and file for an emergency custody order.  You will probably have to wait until Monday to request that, which means the kids have to go home until then.  If you can get one, great!  The kids would stay with you until an investigation can be done.  Of course, nobody can guarantee how it would turn out.  Your daughter should be able to have a say , but all states are different concerning a child's age when something like this happens.  The most important thing is the safety of your children.|`|	The ones you listed are the only ones who can legally help you. Have you thought of just calling the mother and asking if they kids can stay with you for a while? If she's locking them out, they are probably a burden in her mind anyway. Just ask, then if she says no I'd get legally involved. And teach your kids how to handle being locked out of the house. If she does that, tell them to go to a neighbors and call the police. All that will be on record when it does come time to fight in court.

Look at this as a bless one that regardless whether his part of or not your having taking care of and no matter what the circumstances of conceiving her were whether a mistake or not u will consider the baby a joy which you will enjoy for the rest of your life.|`|g6n3OnmSaa	What a selfish jackass.  You're the one carrying the child and he thinks he gets to be mad about the inconvenience.  He is a moron not to understand that you can get pregnant on the pill.  He was having sex, he should have understood that this was a possibility unless he had had a vasectomy.      Do you really want to marry him?  I can imagine what a jerk he's going to be if you have a difficult pregnancy.  I would take this time to consider what life would be like without him.        Also, I agree with the others- great letter, it's true, but don't send it.  He's not going to get it.        And your very last sentence scares me.  Does he make you happy?|`|UNLrYNeUaa	he is the father, right?|`|rcut6bhoaa	Should have waited until after you were married...........it was only 2 weeks away.

Tough situation.      I believe everything you said is true.  But if you haven't sent that letter DON'T SEND IT.  The guy was totally in the wrong but you are attacking him in a way that will just make things worse.      Did you plan to eventually have children?  Was that something you two discussed?  If so, why did he react so strongly?      Be objective for a moment and recognize that he had some reason to think that a baby name might mean you planned this.  I would give him a day or two to cool off and then see what happens.|`|W5wCArLqaa	I think it sounds better. I am so sorry that it is happening to you. But you showed strength in this letter which tells me that you are someone who can take care of you and your baby without anyone's help. My prayers are with you. The guy who can leave you in this situation is no use. He showed that how irresponsible he is.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	well first of all, if you guys didn't want to get pregnant, you should have WAITED after the career was finished and have a more blissful setting for the baby, meaning money saved in the bank and being prepared for a baby. it really didn't matter that you were on birth control, because all that does is REDUCE your chances of getting pregnant, so knowing that, you both were willing risk that chance....you got pregnant.    he needs to wake up and realize that he is at fault too. women don't make babies by themselves, if that were the case, then men would not be needed at all. when he walked out that door....actually when men like to bail out every time a woman is pregnant, that lets you know that he just walked out and abandoned his own flesh and blood.    i think the letter is real eye-opener, but for someone like him who proved to be REALLY selfish, i doubt it would do anything. i would not even bother. i would get on with my life and raise the baby, put him or her through school, ENJOY the memories and time you have with him or him, watching your kid come home with pictures he or she drew for you, i mean babies are a BIG blessing and he...he'll just miss all of it. so i would not even bother with the letter. he is SOOOO not worth it.|`|AA11990465	I think it's good that you're not getting married. It doesn't sound like he even loves you and if he lies to you he isn't worth anything anyway. You don't need him, trust me.     You can raise a child alone so don't worry about marrying this guy. Just wait until your child is born and file for child support. He may not be a daddy, but he is still going to have to pay for his child and if he is in the  military, they will garnish his wages to be sure you get the money.|`|t81MEJ82aa	You were about to get married and you will be a mom soon it's time to grow up. What would be the purpose of this letter...to not reconcile?    It was probably an emotional reaction by him. Finding out that you are about to be a parent is stressful, EVEN FOR FATHERS. Many women do not do back flips when they first find out they are pregnant but then hold it against men for having the same reaction. Going into naming the baby and just finding out you were pregnant may have been overwhelming. Not saying that he was thinking these things but just offering a different perspective. But the way you are handling the situation is only going to make it worse, and is quite juvenile.     Do not listen to these bitter women. He may or may not come around but do not base the rest of your life because he blew up last night. They already have you raising this kid by yourself. Take a calmer approach.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	nothing. either he will come back by himself, maybe it was a  sudden shock for him and he needs a short time to swallow it,  or, in case he does not come back, it is good riddance. he  never would have been a good and reliable partner.  if he does not come back, get advice and help, which is  available for single mothers in most places.    do not run after him.|`|yy45iAbtaa	why write him a letter he proved to you he was no good yu said he lied to you before.why bring a child into a world were the dad does not want it and ruin your whole life and not his i think you should have an abortion if you think you are going to keep this man by having his child you are wrong he is going to run as fast as he can away from you.by sending that letter you are only making yourself look pathetic.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	""First of all, why the hell would I get pregnant on purpose?

fmNEhf3Qaa	Yeah it is too much to ask from "realistic" people, even fathers, who don't even dare to dream that fantasies and dreams can actually be applied to the real world. They will be the one who will tell you to shun from anything that's "too good to be true".  But usually that realistic aspect only apply to people other than themselves. Is that selfishness? Not really. Your mum doesn' t have to sacrifice her cravings of what that seems like frivolous things for your education.  But anyway, you should just depend on yourself for everything, especially when your parents disappoint you.|`|NdrO7u79aa	You have a right to be upset, but don't let it cloud your judgment on college. First of all, be proud of your accomplishments thus far. Talk to your guidance counselor and look into all of the scholarships and grants available to you. There are tons of them out there for good students like you.    Getting your degree is first and foremost. Don't put so much importance on the school that it comes from. Staying active in college, maintaining good grades and doing things like internships and fellowships will help you land the job you're looking for some day. You're at the point now where you are responsible for your own life, so being mad at your parents will only hold you back.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Go talk to your guidance counselor and see what grants and scholarships you can still apply for.  Find out how you could take out student loans and see if you can get a job while at school, many will allow you to work for the school in order to pay.  You can still get into a great college, but you are going to have to rely on you and not them.  Find out how much they are willing to give you, how much they were going to pay for the other college and ask them to pay that to the good college and then try and figure out how you can pay for the rest.|`|xoMtYuFLaa	ok think of it like this your parents payed for every thing when you were a baby and a child so......don't be mad|`|1pgObdMeaa	they should be telling u to reach for the stars... i am from Australia so we dont really do the college thing like you guys do but still if my parents told me to settle for second best i wouldnt be happy at all..|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Sorry to hear about that. I know quite a bit about families who are unwilling to support you. At the same time, what makes the school you're going to "really crappy"? As someone who will be over 50k in debt by the time I graduate next May, let me tell you a secret:    The less you can spend while getting a degree, the more of an advantage you have starting off than the rest of us.     And if you really have your hopes set on the other school? Spend a year or two at the one you got accepted to. Get your basics out of the way (because they're pretty much the same everywhere), WORK and make some money, and then transfer. If you're worried about aid, you can separate yourself from your parents and make it so they don't claim you as a dependent. Then you can apply for aid by yourself.     Just try to remember that you are very lucky to be able to get a college education. Many, many people never get that chance. So don't knock the school you got into - I'm sure there are hundreds of kids who went straight from high school to one of the local factories because they couldn't afford anything else who would be very willing to take your place.|`|eb51db6616f7c8199ef567345fea8d15aa	You have every right to be angry. This is your life, no one else's.  It's not too much to ask to be supported.
TPTpwarwaa	Maybe he really is tired, but that doesn't mean you can't get him in the mood...when he comes home surprise him with you being naked in the bedroom, or right at the door surprise him with a BJ (first give him a red bull for some energy, lol thats what i do sometimes). My boyfriend loves both of those :)  Maybe start trying new tricks..Be more kinky....food? handcuffs? Check out a local sex store, get an outfit that is in his fantasies (if you dont know, ask him!)   Get a sex book with different positions, and get in some kinky positions on top    Oh and sending him dirty texts always does the trick (i forgot to wear panties today and i cannot wait to see you later! is an example lol), give him a long hot kiss before he leaves for work (with some hands traveling down south), hide (either in the car or briefcase) something he loves like a candy bar, a sexy/cute/dirty little note and your hottest panties that he loves somewhere, once he finds it he'll go crazy|`|GMNKQxPraa	I wish you where my girlfriend ;) dunno he sounds gay|`|haWw3B8aaa	Maybe he  "  watches  " a lot of porn.|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	maybe he is just tired. maybe you guys could try to arrange a weekend vacation or something, even just a stay at a fancy hotel near you, in order to relax and jumpstart the passion again.|`|RHlM6jgoaa	When he gets home from work, make him a really nice dinner, light candles (i know it's cliche but hey.. ), put on a slinky tight dress, or buy a new one, do your makeup and your hair and clean the bedroom, after the main course, tell him that you have dessert for him, and when he asks what it is, tell him that it's upstairs. Obviously that should set things rolling, lol. More sex should follow after that, because he should see what he's missing. :) Good luck!  Emily.|`|fvN18yvGaa	Outside of something physically not working...there isnt a man on the planet that is ever...EVER 2 tired for sex...time to put ur detective hat on...hes 20..at that age i was doing as much in one day as I could...|`|DiUx1HzIaa	maybe you just need to spice things up.  try different things to get him going,  and then once you do, use some different techniques.  try this website.  http://www.sexinfo101.com/  its a tad graphic,  but hey, hope it works.|`|e5cbcb4ac6c942012d08df3df6d9915baa	Start by giving him head to get him started ... then get on top so he doesn't have to do much. Once he is horny he wont be too tired. When guys are horny they are rarely too tired for sex.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	When I was young, I would come home from work and my wife would see me at my worst~~exhausted, frustrated, angry...the commute, and the job were exacting a high price on the solemnity of our union.  I did not know then, but the key is to have him go into his room when he comes home and close the door.  Let him be for about an hour or so.  Having rid myself of my monkey suit and all it represented, I emerged feeling more attractive, alive, and real.  It took me a long time to see that her nurturing and pampering of me was not chauvinistic, but was her way of showing her love for me.    Hopefully he knows how much your want him and how you dream about his bodacious attributes day and night.  You say all you want to do is get laid~~let him make love to you as well.|`|MqoQiLcuaa	Start with out him or jump him... maybe he'll get the idea... if not maybe wanna stock up on batteries.|`|ACVqH0sGaa	lol invest in a vibrator|`|VHlQXxlFaa	Dont give up, try little things with sexual feelings ti try to excite him.  maybe when he comes home at night, meet him at the door in just an apron, or with nothing, do a candle light dinner to get him in the mood.  but by all means dont give up keep trying|`|MHQVnqaXaa	slip him some viagra. then get him all hot and bothered and watch the sparks fly.|`|4uYAkBtEaa	Maybe he needs a vacation from working ?  His life is maybe getting too repetitive.|`|DsCydW7qaa	before he comes home, phone him and tell him to phone you back when he's about 15mins away from ariving home, then make everything romantic, candels light, you know the lot. put some seductive music in the background. when he's standing outside your door, make sure that you are wearing seducing lingerie, black, and nothing else apart from make-up, that'll really turn him on. drag him straight into the bedroom, make sur curtains are closed, then take all his clothes off of him and gently push him ont the bed, then slowly strip tease and take off all your clothes but take your time as he needs to get into the mood. then go for it. start off with caressing his **** and kiss him ALL OVER. then you should lay him down on his back and start sex. oh n don't forget to let his kiss, caress and suck your breasts, he'll love it and he will instantly start asking for more.use condoms if you don't want to get preg|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Learn how to relax him so he won't be so tired.  Message, rubs, use your fingers and a lot stuff called foreplay.  He will get the hint soon enough.  Don't tell him your after sex, let that be a surprise.|`|838VJJGvaa	Take a long weekend and invest in some adult items.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Don't give him an option.  Jump on him and "rape" him.  He'll love it!|`|9c2inRKaaa	Why don't you go out and buy some hot lingerine or something and get something interesting to try out...maybe like a vibrator, or a Trojan Vibrating Ring, or maybe some KJ His and Hers Lubricant...      sometimes things get boring if it's just the same routine...try something new!|`|yqI6Nfpfaa	You guys are REALLY young.

Nothing's the problem, except for the fact that you guys are too young and do it way too much!!
07fhLLr8aa	well when i was scared to death. i called my 2 best friends. and they talked to me. and calmed me down. then they said you can come over to our house. and so i ran and they met me. and i cried and cried.   also  when one of us needs help we help. we all know that no matter how mad we get. we will still be the best of friends.|`|w5DAHDeSaa	ah ya|`|yOnPEbcIaa	everything|`|RMZ21EUuaa	We fought like a married couple, now I think we are growing apart.

r4nBWJwLaa	i think he just needs to be a bit more comfortable around you. get him talking about something he likes (hobbies, interests)or something hes passionate about. if your stuck of thinks to talk about just say a really random sentence! that what i do! say something like ''im cold'' and usually it starts a conversation that leads to something else and so o and so on.  if he doesn't start being more affectionate, talk to him about it. im sure when he understands how you feel he will become less awkward.|`|LWVWvvmJaa	give him some Valium :)|`|piZhjtf1aa	Make him a sandwich, he is angry because you do not spend enough time in the kitchen.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Why are you dating him if it's awkward? Why are you in a relationship...Usually when a guy asks you to be his girlfriend you can't stop talking about things together because that's chemistry. No offence here but maybe you rushed into the relationship. If you knew a lot about eachother you wouldn't run out of things to say.|`|RHlM6jgoaa	Ask yourself a few questions (and answer truthfully)    - Does he make you laugh?  - Can you tell him everything?  - Is he your best friend aswell?  - Do you feel sexually attracted to him?  - Are you happy in this relationship?  - Are you more like friends rather than boyfriend or girlfriend?    And once you look at your answers, you'll see whether there's really any point in you two going out.  Emily.|`|KjlxISEXaa	t1ts or GTFO
m2ARO4ZIaa	Well you could go outside for some random task and have her come with you, and right before your coming back in you can grab her arm and do it. Definitely when you 2 are alone though.
cie3oBcXaa	It could be it had that effect on me. When I was on the pill I felt tearful and irritable and had mood swings all the time. When I came off it, I went back to normal. It may be worth having a chat with your doc to maybe try an alternative method of contraception. Good luck :)|`|30297a1ffd97acd6f8c549f566fa288eaa	Birth control usually makes sex better because the fear of pregnancy is lifted.  I can only answer from the biological standpoint that the pill is unlikely to cause these feelings.  There are other issues involved here. You will need counseling to find out what. Do not depend on the the internet to solve this problem|`|Umsj08pnaa	Why don't you try switching to a different brand of birth control, perhaps a patch with a lower dosage.
qRuXJI2jaa	Good job on writing. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders. No matter where you go or what you do people are going to judge you. The way you look, talk, act, work ect., Just always have respect for yourself and those around you and you won't have problems there. The family is the hard part. You've been to rehab so you know a little about different organizations that can help. Get with family crisis organizations. They can probably help you the most. Hang in and don't give up. The church can help also. Find a good one and go as much as you can. Being around the right people will help you deal with hard problems. I'll also give you my email so you can have someone to talk to. acewrks@gmail.com|`|AA10166553	Ok, you didn't say how old you are, but, you need to just set out to make a plan. Figure out what you need to do to make your life better, and do it. Finish your education, get a job, save your money, move out and worry about yourself. If the rest of the family doesn't want to make their lives better, then, leave them behind and go on with your own life.Get into counseling and just show everyone that you can make a better life for yourself if you Truly want to. good luck.|`|e5cbcb4ac6c942012d08df3df6d9915baa	First of all, I am proud of you for checking into rehab and making the decision to get clean! That is the hardest choice of all to make. As far as what you can do... go see a counselor if you can. If you are back in school there should be a counselor there. Just talking out your problems can help so much. If you can't see a counselor you can email me at wagner.becki@gmail.com and we can chat.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Dear heart, there are several red flags here regarding this man.  you do not want to bring a child into this.  Your man has no regard for you, and treats you like a thing at his dispolal.  That is not love.  He will make a lousy father, and treat you much worse if he thinks you are trapped into being with him by virtue of the pregnancy.  Don't tell him your going to have a baby.  It's time to step up and get rid of him-for your sake, and for the coming child if your own life doesn't mean enough to you.  Please read the link.  Do what is right-be happy.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Well its up to you if you think that will make him be less violent around you.

The child would be better without him in her life. Just like you would be. If you tell him he can use the child as a chain to tie to you.     He will get visitation and you will constantly worry about the well being of your child, such as him driving drunk and who knows what kind of people he will associate himself with.     I wish I would have left my abusive child's father and never told him I was pregnant.|`|ZD4NOw2eaa	Well i think you have anwsered the question your self "i don't want him to be a father to my child" if you dont want him to be the father of your child you obvously dont trust him or love him as much as you would to get married to him. And the sounds of your marriage , he doesnt do any choirs and he throws things at you and abuses you any woman deserves better than that. I say talk to him one more time if it gets any worse get out of the relationship before it gets worse and you will really get hurt.|`|HEQc83d9aa	I am so sorry for you!  Hun, let me tell you a very important thing; you only live once. When you die you will never come back again. So, would you like to live in a happy place or be treated like a servant? do you not deserve some respect?   you said you don't want him to be the father of your un born,but yet he is! you have to face up to reality, he is the father and if its not what you want, then there is an option.  There is always a choice in life in no matter what situation your in.  Leave or stay. Your so young, you should be out dating and meeting friends for lunch, not writing on yahoo answer's a question you would expect from someone in  their 40's. Me, I would leave and think carefully about the pregnancy. Its your future no one else's! xx   E-mail me if you like, I have been divorced.|`|cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	What you are dealing with is emotional abuse, which is escalating into physical abuse.  GET OUT NOW.  I know what you are probably frightened, and being pregnant has you at your wit's end, but there are services available in every state--as well as in many countries--that can help you get the assistance you need to leave.  I don't know if you have your high school or college diploma; if not, get them.  Also, look into public assistance; I know that this decision may be difficult, but realize that assistance is there for you.  Also, realize that name-calling ("whore" is horrible!) is part of the abuse, and that you are worth more than this situation.  Look into women's services, and realize that you are not alone.  Take care and God bless.|`|nr1G4uPyaa	If I were you I'd let him know about being pregnant & then I'd get a divorce.  That is abuse & I lived in that for most of my life cause I had low self-esteem.  I stayed in the relationship why I don't really know.  I prayed a lot & after 6 months I was able to sell my stuff & move to MO from TX,were I lived for 22 years.  Now  I'm with a wonderful kind, loving ,man that I adore & he loves me too.  We are able to talk things out that bother us. You & your baby will be a lot happier.  To Thy Own Self Be True!!|`|97045927b14acdd86cc1158f63518afdaa	your in a very bad and maybe dangerous relationship . i wouldnt want my child to live with this violent and unconsiderate man...you already tryed to talk to him and look what happened....get out while your ahead.|`|BtxQogSzaa	I would get out of the relationship. it sounds to me if hes thrown a glass which only just missed you then its the start of violence. which believe me is no place to bring up a child.  I know its eaier said than done, but leave him, and do it soon. If once you have gone he knows about the baby, and wants you to come home, then you need to talk things about how he has to be. but he needs to realise he can't treat you like this, and if you have to walk out to show him how serius you are then it'll have to be done. its all good you saying you will leave him but if he knows he is the stronger person and he wont believe you.     You also need to talk, if there is no communication in the marriage theres no point being in the marriage.  Also you 24, you deserve to be happy, your too young to be in a misserble marriage! which is meant to be you happy place with a loving husband, and happy children.    good luck
DUPOEk1daa	Wow!!!  Sounds like a great wedding!  But I don't have any suggesstions for the wording.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	instead of "joy of our wedding" you could say "Invite you to share the joining of their hearts."    sounds good though! good luck and congrats!|`|OMKjo5plaa	Invite you to share in a celebration of their love.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Put the specific date of your wedding, not the dates of the cruise.  Use an additional piece of paper to put supplemental information such as your web site, the dates of the cruise, etc.      ??-I didn't think you could get legally married on cruises anymore since they are international waters?  That changed a few years ago, are you sure the wedding will be legal?  I was told it had to be performed on land not on the cruise anymore.  Just wondering.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi Nicole:    Here is what I think....take it for what it is....only a suggestion.    I do understand that your cruise will be five nights, but I would still word the invitation for the EXACT DATE that you will be married.  Obviously, those invited will know that it's a five night cruise.  And, as an experienced cruiser, I know that you will most likely be married BEFORE the ship sails (or in a port at one of your destinations.)    Here is my suggested wording (fictitious names, obviously).    Together with our parents  Nicole Marie Anderson  and  Greg Michael Johnson  invite you to share our joy  as we are united in marriage  aboard the Carnival Cruise Ship Fantasy  Monday, the twelfth of October  Two thousand and nine  at four thirty in the afternoon  Port Everglades, Florida|`|RKsn5dD4aa	invite you to share   our matrimonial moment

It normally works. don't do something dramatic but slowly do things.|`|clu2Ia4paa	make friends with nice outgoing pushy people  my best friend is outgoing( im not) she keeps taking me to her friends making me hang out with them (worked a little untill i met a girl that is a lot like me and is also talkative and outgoing) which made me be like them.....i'm still shy but around certain people am not. when i get used to a person(meet them about 4 5 times then i m not shy around them anymore)  hope i helped. good luck :)|`|poC9j0Diaa	Well I am sorry to say that there is no pill to take to magicly get over your shyness. What you need to do is join some club or sports team at school. If you think that you can't do that get a friend to do it with you and then talk to people. You have to change it yourself.|`|UtzALxfjaa	Meet someone that will inspire you. I met this girl named Katie. She was outgoing; I was shy. I pretended I was her. I acted like her, dressed like her for a couple of days, and boom! I was outgoing.

Say hi every once in a while, make small talk. And then after a while if your friendly you can start hanging out with people more regularly.|`|eSDNSq4zaa	look hot and socialize.|`|dOsqhNJ5aa	you just have to stop caring about what other people think...i mean why should you care, you only live once... :P|`|znxbqEv1aa	just do things that you normally wouldnt do!   dont care what others think about you, cuz life is way to short for that!  have fun!|`|DK3wRkkwaa	socialize, express your interests with others, go out more with friends and family, join school clubs, extracurricular activities, or sports, just to name a few =]
RzIiywZ6aa	Well, I think you should tell her the truth.  All of this lying and going behind her back is eventually going to come out. Why is it so bad to tell her that she wasn't invited to the sleepover because you thought that she already had plans, and then when she asked, your friends mom had already told you guys that only you three could sleep over. It might hurt her feelings a little, but she'll get over it pretty fast when you explain the situation to her.|`|mdtkor2Paa	dont tell her anything|`|XL5sB7PKaa	ok you should tell her, cause its not good when you keep a secret from your best friend and then she finds out. Tell her that since she is going to the bar mitzvah that you guys are having the sleep, but don't tell her that cathryns mom sayed only you guys can go, cause some things are better left unsaid. and she will probably be ok with it, but tell her your sorry for wats going on. hoped i helped bye
FcNOkHquaa	It doesn't mean anything.  He just thinks perverted stuff is funny.

(cough cough first answerer)    I would say he's like any other teenage guy. If it bugs you talk to him, if not, let it go.|`|F0sQ18MKaa	It means he's horny|`|EYPY87woaa	every single guy i know does this.  it's just how they try to be funny.|`|I199P9yMaa	It means he's an 18 year old guy|`|znxbqEv1aa	hes a pervert!|`|v02ZYVcvaa	He's flirting with you. He wants to be with you.|`|6eSRjnx4aa	It means he wants to bang you but he's not sure if you're down so he's watching your reaction to his dirty little sex jokes to see if you're turned on or if you give any approving gestures.|`|ycaloVnkaa	He prob just wants to get in ur pants like wut most kinds wants from women.|`|31ac49d076f2ee3dc76ae11e48a42a12aa	it's normal, they're inmature, and that new world they're discovering sounds funny for them|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	It means that he wants to touch you in your pants.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	Think of guys like animals, or maybe babies.  If they get a positive response, they repeat the behavior.  You are encouraging the behavior.  If you want it to stop, stop laughing or smiling when he makes these jokes.|`|yJROr3Iraa	it means he's a teenager  are you hoping for someone to say 'it means he's interested in you' because that may be true but honestly, everyone makes sex jokes, my TEachers make sex jokes.|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	lol, he is still a high school kid. Well at least he just make jokes, not directly and purposely disturbs you. I mean if you can't stand the way he talks like that, tell him in a positive manner way. I hope he will understand. But if u r o.k with that than O.K.  Well, does he talk to others like that too? you have to find out, but i mean he just say like that, like joking, make fun, and you can tell that he's not disturbing you, than it's just his personality.  But well, my friends (guys) in school sometime joke like that too ...nothing directly, for example, somebody says banana or something and they just make jokes about it.|`|4M7ELAp4aa	Just an 18 year old dude. I havent met one guy that doesnt do that. Every second of the day. But....it could mean that he wants you cuz he sits with u like all his persiods and stuff.  Lol, ask him out?|`|gO9tl2uhaa	Means he's comfortable with his sexuality.    Plus, your reply (I don't like snakes as animals) was pretty much the punch of the joke. So, you're doing it too. Does it mean you're attracted to him?    PS: if so, you got weird ways to flirt, girl...|`|tSZ7A1NPaa	You guys are talking bout it because you guys are feeling horny..soon those jokes will lead to sex together|`|rY2pmHxJaa	why dont u **** him relli hard|`|9kKSIfX7aa	sex is bad|`|O0iInu0Naa	invite him home for sex, your too lold to be messing around wasting time|`|GbPnXvlZaa	He either wants the snake in the hole or he's just a really good friend who tells funny jokes.

You need to find your way.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Means nothing.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	It means he likes being perverted|`|tc8nbxmyaa	Thats what guys do. If he acts physically, you should tell someone. Sometimes "jokes" aren't jokes anymore.|`|v7HC2MGXaa	means he's horny and wants you|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i totally agree with the first answer.....hes just a horny boy.... i find it appalling and rude to discuss things in that fashion. its not something to joke about. if you are ok with it then thats you but if you arent then speak up and tell him its bothering you.|`|Tbhmsrlsaa	It could mean one of several things.    1. He likes you in that way and you should problly watch out for him.  2. He is kinda perverted and thinks about that ALL the time.  3. He likes you and doesn't know how to say it....   4. He's treating you like "one of the guys" (like he would a guy friend)  5. He has lost his mind. (hopefully its not this one) Kidding    good luck|`|RC2aQBkgaa	He's just immature. Most guys my age do that too. Boys are pigs, they always will be. Grown men are like that, believe it or not. My real dad is like that and my mom divorced him. Ha, his loss.
l2BjWA5Baa	If you're going to tell her, I agree with grove4life on how to do it (playing up that the guy is being superficial - as you've said, she's really nice, but a guy who doesn't know her obviously has no way to know that), but part of it may be that she was the one asking him out.  Most guys have an inherent drive to pursue, so when a girl runs straight up to him, the fun of the chase is gone (please, everyone, try to understand what I'm saying here and don't jump down my throat).  Definitely start working out with her, and hope you get to know some nice guys at the gym!|`|DZB0WCmmaa	Oh... so, judging by your "edit", she must realise that she has a problem. She should unerstand that herself. If she doesn't, they only you can do by telling her the truth is insulting her.|`|bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	Don't mention her weight because she may be offended. Maybe you should set a program with her, be her nutritionist. Summertime is coming up and in 5 months she could lose 130 pounds if she eat less and exercise more. Help her if you want the best for her.|`|ksFBK7Gbaa	Um yes because 300 pounds is HUGE|`|6BwCwuHwaa	Never tell your friend she too fat or she over weight or whatever just keep encouraging her to find guys who are interested in her type .. or you sure it's or weight and not her looks..??|`|ueAv14FJaa	NEVER tell your friend shes realy fat because theres a 75% chance she might turn anorexic anyways, try saying it kinda funky you know like    "wow look at me i have to lose some weight how about me and you go to the gym everyday and work out how does that sound?"  hope i helped|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	Buy her a treadmill.|`|KZfYzhZRaa	tell her the truth but do it in a nice way just say umm guys can be really superficial it might be your Weight and then if she wants you can go to the gym with her and help:)|`|F1QjqqxRaa	hmmmm its seems to me she needs to exersise a bit Tell her to do it and come and do it with her ( a little exersise wont hurt no one ;) )   And make sure u do it with her. Help her eat good heatly foods and help her with well overwait problems.But dont get disurgaged, you are doing a great job, by telling her to not give up is giving her hope and that is what she needs so dont be afraid to give it to her. However, dont make her wait problesm seem HUGE and obseve over them, just kindly suggest tti exersise with her say uhh 4 times a week for 40 mins. If u obbseve over it she will feel uncomtroble and may even avoid u   Hope this helps :)
w3feYgkCaa	I'm not sure, he completely likes you. He's probably just being nice. But if he starts, flirting with you, like touching your arm or hand or something, and picking you up or something like that then he probably likes you. But right now yall are on the friend level, so start flirting with him, but don't go over the top.  Just compliments then work your way up :D|`|24fjUKaVaa	Possibly. Try and get to know him better.

When i first see the question i thought you meant something else ;)|`|v398Qalyaa	i'm dairy intolerant so i hate it too, and my bowel does!|`|WAEDIWz8aa	loooooooooooolll @ 'is my girlfriend just a weirdo?' loooll      oh my oh my. i mean everyone had milk  in someway or an other in their lives. lol    dunno why she doesnt like it.     its a bit weird lol|`|Hzzdalavaa	Milk is nice.|`|LbGRsCTKaa	Sounds like you don't have enough to do today.   Is your homework done?|`|vwoqIUR6aa	maybe she's allergic or got sick drinking milk once that now she doesn't like it|`|vrfuO9Asaa	maybe she just doesnt like it|`|e9vcseLlaa	sooo whats the question??

It's nothing to do with the milk obviously, and yeah its absolutely revolting when perhaps she was expecting more than an urge for ****** Milk. You are the weirdo one.
B0aa0cL4aa	idk. im having the same problem now. maybe he's suppossed to be there=]]|`|CDpY5if2aa	i think you must not try to get him out of your head, you must try harder to get his attention. if he likes you, something will happen and you will get relaxed and your mind will be open. Go for it, don't try to back away.|`|838VJJGvaa	There are many ways of going about this.  Read a book.  Watch cartoons.  Go to the mall, but stay out of the romance book sections.  Or you could hit yourself in the head.  I don't advise hitting yourself in the head though.  It could lead to a lot of problems.|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	lol, i've got the same situation right now, and i too want him to get out of my head for we probably do not have future at this point. the way i deal with it is: i set my mind to think of  someone or something else, and it does work for some time, you should focus on something that will distract YOU from him.|`|Gj47yTKvaa	you would like your head to be normal? are your hideously disfigured or two headed like?|`|M3CsxF2jaa	sorry nothing you can do .. ive have tried it all im going through the same thing|`|UtzALxfjaa	Unless you get your memory erased, there is no way to forget someone. Unless you replace them.|`|dOnQuOtyaa	Tell, him, and express your feelings toward him!|`|eSDNSq4zaa	tell him u like him.|`|73GZMpzlaa	well if you think he likes you, then there is the possibility of a relationship.     Perhaps you should pursue it further.     If you'd like to "forget about him", only time can do that.|`|OyLoKcFsaa	you can either tell him you like him - if not you can always write your feelings out for him on paper and rip it up afterwards. it actually helps release some thoughts     or do something that will distract you like watching a movie, listening to music (but not romantic songs).|`|znxbqEv1aa	ahahaha! there is no way! you just need to tell him how you feel and hope for the best!|`|g9DWi0DKaa	if u tell him the worst he can say is no then at least you know if he likes you and it can put your mind at rest|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Tell him tell him tell him that you love him.....................  Tell him tell him tell him that you love him  Tell him tell him tell him right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,|`|DK3wRkkwaa	ahh i'm in the same situation! it sucks, doesn't it? i try not to think about him by talking to other people and getting caught in the moment but it usually doesn't last that long. look at other guys is the obvious answer. but talk to him more and find out if he's crazy about you too. unfortunately, if he's not, get ready for some heartbreak. but if he does like you, maybe he's supposed to be in your head & it would be normal to have him there! good luckk =]|`|wZMq5jqyaa	talk to him. obviously ur thinking about him for a reason. and if you really wanted to get him off your mind, you could.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	ah just don't mess it upp . cuz when you do you feel pathetic. and you won't forget him till ike 6 months after this little connection started. it sucks. soo ask him out.. go for it.|`|uFjoPqJwaa	Spend more time with him, txt him, IM him, face book him. Be more flirty so he knows you're interested Good Luck!|`|6LoQsJdxaa	-go running/jogging  -eat chocolate :PP  -watch tv  -listen to music  -hang out with friends  -talk to your friends  -read a book &&or magazine  -go shopping  -text/call someone  HOPE i helped!|`|7VY5LcX8aa	Ooh this sounds familiar hehe :)  I'm in the same situation.  Ring up your girl mates and get a   night out organised or stay in with  some mates and watch an amazingly good  movie, with chocolate, poopcorn etc.  It will get him off your mind for a while. I find it really works  and during the day, keep yourself really occupied by going and doing sports, swimming etc. It helps me so should help you!    Hope this helps :) .x.
w3feYgkCaa	Omg i hate that. I just resend the message, because sometimes they don't recieve it and sometime's they're busy.|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	maybe he just didn't know what to say to reply...  or he was too busy to reply.|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	don't take this the wrong way, but school is boring.  talk about movies books music friends etcetra.|`|rwC45oq0aa	a lot of guys don't have the attention span to text continually.|`|AZB4BV64aa	most guys think texting usually is for the emergency situation where there is something going on which makes you and him stop talking and also a way to get girls to ask this question and worry about them and think about them. period.|`|cmFU81rQaa	Eh, the conversation ran itself out and he was just done talking.    Guys are concise, direct, and simple.  Not derivitive.|`|MHQVnqaXaa	maybe they're busy.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	maybe he doesn't like you.. talking about school is boring. or maybe he had to go do something.|`|dqeOFL4oaa	i get that all the time. guys are jerks and does not care bout how a girl feels|`|JjJj69xiaa	Depending on what the things were that you needed to talk about is why he left. Or maybe he just needed to go somewhere.if this is some guy you are interested in, you might want to talk about something of interest, and not school.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	kids these days don't know how to have a conversation if there isn't a computer in front of them|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	oh if only i knew|`|AA10503158	Maybe, he thought the conversation was over?  Jeez don't stress over that stuff haha.|`|MhW3pLhLaa	I don't know! I was txting my guy friend the other night and we were talking about a basketball game and then he just stopped talking to me.|`|G0U2ExOSaa	not always.  maybe his mom took his phone.  it hapens to me  or he's a dick|`|poC9j0Diaa	Well I am not 100% sure of anything that guys do. But maybe he likes you. I mean when I am texting someone that I like and they say something that does not need a response I don't text back.I think that I do it because I don't want him to think that I am desperate or something and that I have to talk to him. But who knows. Maybe he was busy or he had to go.|`|zrARzUTPaa	idk i think its just textin. cuz girls do it too|`|eSDNSq4zaa	cause there jerks who think there cool.
LiOOF1Plaa	Nope. Tell her you don't appreciate her cutting off internet. Pay nothing to her.
AA10166553	Doesn't really seem fair, but, Im sure you parents have their reasons.|`|e5cbcb4ac6c942012d08df3df6d9915baa	Wow, that isn't fair at all. Try making a list of why you should get a phone and explain it to them in a mature way.    I'm sorry & good luck =)|`|z18AfZ19aa	i dont understand this method bt maybe they think ur brother may want to get to ur standard bt it seems since hes holdin u back frm a phone he might not even try harder bt maybe if he saw u with a phone that would make him try that bit harder so i dont understand bt they are ur parents and i suppose they know best....
4v0XDwtkaa	Hey, you sound just like me. I am 15 and I just got a new boyfriend. I was nervous to go to his house though because his family is loaded. My tip for you is to just relax. It makes everything better!|`|MKHd10MYaa	If you think you're ready to be committed to someone, go for it. If not, then you're not ready.    Age doesn't signify when you're ready to date. Being ready to be committed is what signifies it.

xZBroXsQaa	No, not if you are respectful in the ways you turn them down. If you don't think you could handle that responsibility of her kids, you have every right to say no. Especially in the choosing of a life partner, you need to do what feels right for you.|`|rSXRBEaCaa	you are being selfish becuz you want her all to yourself... and if that doesnt quit, then what happens if you have kids... your going to want your wife or whatever all to yourself... and that is being judgmental becuz what if someone reazlly likes you, and you blow them off cuz they have kids? what if shes the one for you? what if shes the most beautiful girl youve ever seen and she has kids? it might not happen for you...let loose.    and good luck!! :)|`|qgDqasBWaa	No i dont think that you are being cruel. You may not want to get involved with a woman who has kids and have to take on the responsibility of that. I wouldn't not talk to a woman because of that though...just don't start a relationship if your comfortable with that.|`|fZfVM1unaa	Women with children also carry a lot of inevitable emotional baggage.  This doesn't make them any less lovable or worthwhile, but the effort involved in that kind of relationship can be daunting.|`|zOlQwUdraa	Thats fine. Your probably doing them a favor.|`|tCI4GV29aa	Your not wrong for having your own personal opinion. If you don't want to talk to a woman  with kids you have that right. Your not shallow judgmental that is your personal choice. Although it really is hard most women have kids. I understand I only deal with men who have older children to avoid the babies mama drama. That maybe because I dont have  kids.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Do you talk to your mother?|`|EdidZdtlaa	i dont think your wrong but i think your being judgemental towards them.|`|RoR3o6iQaa	no it just shows your more responsible then them you use a condom!! lol|`|5cDVQED5aa	yeah sound selfish to me. if u like someone and i mean truly like someone u will take on her and her children without even thinkin about it, maybe u just aint found that some one yet|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Nope! I don't get involved with guys that have kids either. Too much aggravation. Personal preference babe! If I wanted kids, I would have had some, I don't and I didn't. Watch all the women with kids thumb me now...lol|`|tsdHndRhaa	hey your not no denzel washington buddy, so you need to take what you can get. stop being a shallow man and give women a chance, some situations are not as they seem, some women really are trying to do good by there kids and not look for a man to mooch off of.|`|y9RKDwvdaa	thats just being shallow.|`|dROrlLvhaa	Not at all, its your life your not ready to be with someone who is ready (or already) to have children.
nr1G4uPyaa	No you just have the right person, or you're happy enough with yourself that you don't want a permanent relationship.  So don't feel bad some people don't want to be married.

8kdjvWAxaa	The registry goes in the Bridal shower invitation. I think you shouldn't say that you have a registry just maybe state cards and money will be accepted.|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	You should never insert registry info with an invitation to a wedding. They are included in shower invitations.  You definately can not ask for cash in lieu of gifts.  Let your closest bridemaid and your parents know your wishes and let them spread it by word of mouth.|`|dVgqFDpIaa	would you like to come to our wedding?|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	You can't word that, you NEVER put that in an invitation.  Your family and friends should tell people word of mouth where you are registered and you should register somewhere because like it or not, people will prefer to buy you a gift.  You can register at AAA or something but you cannot put that in your invitation, it is against etiquette.  Whoever is throwing your shower can insert that because you have no control over that but don't be rude.|`|1rpWknAOaa	People do many things that are considered in extremely poor taste and this happens to be one of those things.  You're invitations should NEVER mention gifts in any shape, form or fashion.  To tell guests that not only do you expect a gift but to tell them what to give you is the height of rude.  I know that many brides do this and feel that it's alright but it really isn't.  Yes, when you're invited to a wedding you give a gift and it's always nice to know what to give the couple but if a person really has no idea where the couple is registered or what they would like then it's up to the guest to contact the couple, a family member of the couple or a close friend of the couple to find out what would be an appropriate gift.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	You don't.|`|pNrfE7fHaa	Set up a honeymoon registry and add an insert directing them to the site.   A lot of those site will let you put like your story and a note to your guest and what-not.  Good luck!
vO1dtPQHaa	You shouldent let someone make you feel like this, shes just another person, if she makes you feel bad (don't be mean) but do something to make her feel the same way you do.
6ZZAvyHNaa	Girls love to play ''hard to get''.... to make guys go insane ;)  Maybe tell this lovely girl that you need to go to the mall, to buy something for your mother's birthday *wink wink* and you need a girl's opinion. thats a good excuse to get her out.    But maybe try not telling her about that ''mothers gift'' lie until way way later on...    Girls are just as shy as guy... some girls wait for the guy to do the first move and if not, she thinks that he's just not into her.    Hope this helps, good luck!!

Hopefully this doesn't end up like War of the Roses. Next time she abuses you, have her arrested. That will certainly look good for you and bad for her when you go to court and will also help you to get custody of your daughter.|`|AA12190953	Go see an attorney. They are going to have the best ways to solve this based on the state u live in. Until then dont leave and especially dont leave without the child. The state i live in the law is that when a child is 14yrs old they can choose what parent they live with. As for the house usually both people have to move out and u sell the house but there is always the option of u or her buying the other person out if one of u decide u want to keep it.   So get an appointment first thing Monday morning so you can get some piece of mind.   Care and Bless|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Get an attorney and file for divorce|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	bring her!!!|`|WItKOQh7aa	It is much more difficult in matters of domestic violence to have a woman arrested, when she is the perpetrator.  If you call the police, and you do not have any visible wounds, (and I mean visible, red marks or slight scratches won't suffice) they will not arrest her, and if she is hysterical, or requests it, you will probably be told to leave the premises.  What's WORSE is if she has any marks on her, even if they are not as visible, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.    Now, if she is prone to threatening you during these altercations, what you can do, is secretly tape record it. (I know that's not exactly easy, but it will be concrete evidence if you can get it) If you can get her on tape threatening you, you can have HER arrested.    Is she abusive to your daughter as well?     Either way, you should take your daughter and leave.  No house is worth the misery of being abused and emasculated.  I'm not advocating losing your home and investment.  I'm just saying that you should leave in the interim, to preserve your safety and sanity.      I would then exhaust every possible means of taking back every penny I ever spent to make her comfortable.    People do not realize that men are also victims of abuse and violence.
c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	You're still young, you have plenty of time to deciede what you want to do in life!  To find out what you're interested in, stop doing things that everyone else is doing and try lots of new things, and if you don't like doing something or if you don't feel like doing it, then don't!  Join new clubs at school and take different classes than what you usually take.  You can also meet new people this way.  As for the friends part, the best way to make a friend is to be a friend.  Don't look for all the bad things in others, because you wouldn't want your friends doing that to you.  Try being nice to everyone, and you will probably find people being nice back to you.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	you always find what your looking for when you stop looking  sounds odd but thats life for you|`|bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	You're young and you have plenty of time to think about your career. Don't copy anyone, they're already taken. Before anyone can like you, you have to like yourself first. Find your interests or special talents you have. Then you can find friends that you have in common with. perhaps you need to be sociable and confident. Always introduce yourself when you meet new people, if they're not interested then find other people|`|AA12160073	How about volunteering in the community?  You would surprised at whom you would meet say at a hospital or animal shelter.  By doing for others, you help yourself grow.  Godloveya, honey.|`|Z9Xeoq7Xaa	The worst thing you can do is not be yourself.  Are you doing another things because that is what is 'cool'? That's the wrong turn to take. Don't play "follow the leader", if you know what I'm saying. You MUST have something you like to do after school or for a hobby, what you find is fun. Get aquainted with others kids that like to do that too.  It can take a little while to find friends, but can take forever to get used to and have fun with them
OKjYOr0xaa	well take this summer to make up credts. if your trully are worried then you will make an effort...      about the army, seriously if u got the potential go for it dont just go becase u feel dumb at school ...     yes go to college.. community college is always the answer
kccXcgVaaa	Tell them when your 18. Tell them you are now legally not a child anymore and you can do what you want.    Move out if they say "Well, you are still under my roof" or something weird like that.    Lol.  [:    Yeaaaa![:|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Well, if your parents don't want you having sex, then maybe you should not be having sex. It would definitely be better to tell your parents. I mean they can't tell you who to date in 4 1/2 months anyways...it's just better for them to know. Your relationship with them will suffer with all the lies making it up. They will trust you more and be more understanding about the relationship if you would come clean about it.|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	I was in the same situation when I was 16 and my boyfriend was 22 you don't need to worrier about it because you are aloud to leave 6 months before your 18th b-day don't let him talk you into telling your mom and dad because it well just make them more mad at you and he knows it then you won't be aloud to see him anymore.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	When I was 16, I wanted to meet a guy from online who worked at our local pool. He was 21. i asked my parents, they said no because of his age.     About a month later, I talked to another different guy online and I met him. He was 21. About a month later I set it up so that we can actually go out on a date and my parents to meet him. I told my parents he was 18. It wasn't until a couple months down the road (after my parents fell in love with him) when I told them his real age. They weren't mad at his real age, they were mad because I lied. I only lied because I knew they wouldn't let me meet him.     As it turns out, 11yrs later I am married to that man. :-) So you see, everything worked out great. My parents still love him and his parents love me. I am glad I went behind my parents back to meet my husband.    And yes, there was alot of sex involved.|`|MX1shAbcaa	Go ahead and tell them, if they don't understand then w/e, but just be honest.  If you are having sex with this man... yes your parent deserve to know that.....  If i were your parents and knew you were having sex with a 21 year old for a while and you haven't told me, yes i'd be very mad.  Best of luck ~ William|`|hqoUs9OXaa	If you two can wait I would. If your parents are not happy they might call the cops on him.
UCKAiLN1aa	Maybe it's just not time for you to date yet. Just have fun with your girl friends and guy friends. Don't stress about this.    If you really really want to date just tell yourself that good things come to those who take chances. You just gotta take the plunge sometime.|`|VPJJdYCNaa	umm thats tough for anyone but maybe if you got their number and texted them mebbe it would be easier that way. if not you could try just asking them if they like you first, then ask them out. have confidence in yourself! good luck :)|`|Y6mghMloaa	its not that hard just get the guts and do it|`|OyLoKcFsaa	if you've never done it before then of course it will be hard the first time because you don't know what to expect. sometimes it could be that fact that you are scared to get rejected. i think you should just get to know them well enough before asking them out.|`|tX2giFynaa	Hey Mouse,  You can not be a mouse, you are a male. Then why are you feeling shy. Tell her for date. Bring awesome pocket gift and some flowers. Call her for date at move to restaurant or silent place.  Be careful do not push her for sex.    GOOD LUCK    ;)|`|e9vcseLlaa	Just go and ask her. If your not botherd about being rejected then ask her in a more public place. If its the opposit then ask where you and her are alone. Try sitting next to her in lessons and talking to her. Shes most likely to say yes anyway. DO it with pride and confidence then you will seem less botherd if she dosent want to. Try to feel good while you are aswell. Good luck X    Ps. If its your first time, i dont blame you to be nervous!|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Just be easy, and ask her straight up. You don't have to formally ask her out and take her to a five star. Just say, hey you want to go grab some coffee/food/smoothie/drink/whatever.... sometime, its my treat! She'll say yes or she'll make up a bunch of excuses and the excuses mean she's too busy (don't waste your time chasing) or she's not interested. Whether she says yes or no, ask a few girls out, so you can have a few dates. Just treat it casually and it will turn into something on its own. Girls love charm, so turn up the charm. Don't over compliment but give her one or two good ones.|`|dOsqhNJ5aa	"I am kinda shy but plenty of people hang out with me and like me because I'm always pretty fun to hang out with, "    Dont brag too much about yourself!|`|4KMSKrxQaa	grow some balls and just do it. they will most likely say yes anyways|`|QVsxjEo5aa	Just do it and not till you do you'll be more confident  good luck|`|y9RKDwvdaa	be creative. if she has a car, write a note asking her and stick it under he windshield wiper blade thing.   or something like that.  good luck!|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Well, maybe you aren't ready for that type of thing yet. Or, why don't you go out with a group of friends and a date? Then, it would be less awkward. Just ask who ever it is if she wants to do something. You just need to think what's the worst thing that could happen?|`|8ZI62IHkaa	well maybe you should ease yourself into it. Dont think of it as a date. Think of it as just asking a friend to hang out. And if you can't do a one on one right away do more of a double date kind of thing.    There is nothing to be shy about. Don't even ask. Say that you were going to such and such place and tell her she should come.    If you ask her you're giving her the chance to say no. But when she thinks you'll be going there with or without her... she be more inclined to say yes. Because its showing that your not being needy and will be fine either way.|`|XL5sB7PKaa	my advise would be to just hang out with everybody and do the same thing you've been doing, but if you find someone you really really really like then get up the courage and ask her out, you never know she might yes :)|`|dcJome8raa	Just be yourself! Talk to her like you'd talk with your friends and if your "pretty fun to hang out with" I'm sure you'll be fine. If you find it too hard to ask her in person, stick a cute note in her locker. Anything cute or corny usually wins a girl's heart.     Good Luck!|`|z9Ard2Daaa	Just do it. Be confident and don't be scared. The worst thing that would happen is that she would say no... But don't let that get you down. There a plenty of girls that will say yes. Just get to know then first.|`|w8KQzxa1aa	ignore the rude comments like answer  1.  just play it cool and take it slowly.  next time u r out with a bunch of friends especially at the movies, sit near her, then just say it was a good movie and u had a nice time.   then next time, dont invite the others   idk if this will work, but it is worth a try    good luck!!!!|`|L2phA2qXaa	I have the same problem. Here's what I've found easiest:    Don't ever use the word date. If you don't put pressure on yourself about it, then she won't feel pressured either. Using the word "date" is just putting pressure on it. Just ask to her hang out: Go see a movie, go to a unique little place you know (cereal bar in my hometown), etc. Then flirt and when you get done say something like- "I had a great time with you. I'd like to hang out again soon." She'll prob give you a positive response if you played your cards right. And also, this eliminates rejection (sort of). If she doesn't really view it as a date, then you can always say it never was a date because all it ever was to you was just friends hanging out. Here's a line you can use:    "Hey, I know this great little cereal bar/karaoke joint/whatever you want to put here. Come check it out with me. You'll have fun. I promise. "    See what she says. You'd be surprised.|`|JZFB6A5Baa	Wow people leave some mean advices! but hey everyone gets little tense when they are around the people they like! I am a girl and I am super talkative! I can start a conversation with anyone and continue it as long as possible. But whenever I see my crush my tongue just disappears. I don't know why. But you are a guy! When it comes to asking girls out, some girls just wait until the guy asks them. And more of us read or get advices from people who just simply say "he is not that into you!" So if you like a girl, please just go and ask her out before it is too late.    Wish you all the best!|`|WB028eTDaa	I guess you either need to just ask her out or get over it. She's going to move on pretty quickly, and there's no way she can tell if you like her if you don't do anything about it. The worst thing that could happen is that she'll say no to you, and if she does, shrug it off. Those people that hang out with you, like you mentioned, should be there for you, so no worries.|`|0HYG8PlNaa	Just ask if they would like to go get a cup of coffee or tea. That way you or her are obligated to spend alot of time together if it doesn't seem to be going right. And just take a deep breath and get out with it.|`|Da1bmBQnaa	i dont no hust keep telling u self u have 2 do it or else it will never happen|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	shy is hot lol just go for it|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You are affraid of the rejection and that every one will laugh at you.  Start by inviting a girl to a group thing, so if she says no it doesn't look like a date, no shame.|`|s1NS1sqvaa	if everybody thinks your nice and sweat then you should not have a problem getting this girl to go with you. now if she says no she wont care cause ur a nice guy, so she wont have any hard feelings. Dude it took me 4 months to ask a girl out last year. it was the hardest thing ever. But once i did it, it wasnt so bad well i got rejected but whatever. Just go for it man=)!!!!!!!!!|`|RdMpPhhPaa	jst ask her nd be confident

pNqjsJn7aa	well..if they are so hell bent in loosing weight...u can try and give them better ideas like joining a gym or some dance classes..this way....ur friends as well as ur problem will get solved....;)|`|YIZXYKDxaa	When your friends say that they think they are fat ignore that and change the subject joking, and laughing about it makes them feel like they will get attention from it! So far it seems that you have been doing what you should be doing and if it does become a habit then tell someone, and also you are able to comfort them tell them that your still growing and it will slim out! Its like growing into their skin! You know how kittens have a lot of extra skin when they are little well they grow into it and they become lean and skinny well even though they aren't fat, they see themselves as fat so tell them these things to comfort them! If worst comes to worst give them a reality check show them that your not afraid to get mad and frustrated with them when they do those things, let them know how mad you get. And if they are really your friends they will realize how mad and depressed it makes you and no friend likes seeing their other friend sad!
jp9OzuXoaa	I didn't read all of that, but she seems pretty rude. Friends shouldn't be rude towards you. :)|`|akngjKE6aa	i'm sorry but it doesn't sound like any of these girls are your true friends.  i used to be like you... i'm a senior now. but, i just wanted a friend so i started hanging out with people just to feel like i had someone. i soon found out that those people wern't my friends by the way they treated me. early last year, i started making new friends and now, i have the best friends anyone could ever ask for. they love me for me and i love them for them. that's what friendship is, loving them even when they're unlovable and understanding the reason behind their rash emotions. it sounds like you need to first learn how to be a friend before you seek them out.  good luck.
m1AL7SwWaa	Wow lol.  Some parents do that. It feels awkward doesn't it? Getting to go with you and your wife on your honeymoon and in one deluxe suite is like fuel for them to get in the honeymoon mood i think that's what they intent to do.  And you have the right to say something. Tell your mom it's not funny and it doesn't sound at all appetizing if that is what she's thinking. In one deluxe suite is just awkward but for them i'm sure it not. It's like they make it their honeymoon lol, no offence.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Don't do it.  You MUST, absolutely MUST be alone and on your own with you spouse during your honeymoon.  It's important that you and your new spouse form a new nucleus.    Some parents have a hard time with the separation that must occur when their children get married.  You're going to have to put your foot down and say no.|`|tgtsbxpBaa	Well - unless you can afford to pay for, and go on, a seperate honeymoon yourself, you're pretty much out of luck.  I didn't even get any sort of honeymoon because we couldn't afford it.  Feel lucky!
GuA9zI3haa	Sweetheart... MOVE ON!! I went through the same exact thing with this guy i dated...and i let it go on for over a year and a half before i realized that we just weren't right for each other. We would get into the same fight over and over again and he would never admit he was wrong. Do yourself a favor and get out of the relationship while you can. Just end it and don't talk to him for a while, so you have time to learn that you did the best thing for you, and ultimately for him.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	if he wont say anything back when you apologize and thinks he is always right, even with friends, i wouldnt stick around.    He obviously has a superior attitude   and how long do you want to live with that ?    if you truly want to know how he is feeling, stop the apologizing and wait and see what happens.  if he does and says nothing, he can care less about you.  you have told him what you think /feel.  i would start to distance myself from him and see how he reacts.   good luck
AA10859291	Then, you have your answer!   It is all about how YOU feel about this topic (and all other topics). If you take some quiet time to think about your question.........you will probably have a "gut feeling".    p.s.  Why don't you write down how you feel about a few key things (gay marriage, abortion, death penalty, etc)   and date that piece of paper and put it in a sealed envelope today!)............A few years from now...open it and read it.  Did you "stand firm" on this or that...and tweak this or that belief............and maybe think totally differently about something..?    Enjoy yourself.  Learn to really, really like you.     btw~~ I am gay :)|`|xGshAiXOaa	I think that the fact that they are not allowed to marry is a disgusting misrepresentation of one of the basic principles of this country.  Anyone remember that there is supposed to be a separation of church and state?  What the Bible has to say should have no effect on our laws or on our government.  Taking the fact that the Bible says it's wrong out of the picture, why should they not be allowed to marry?  Because to some heterosexual individuals it's not natural, it's disturbing?  The last time I checked that wasn't quite enough to make something illegal.  Just because a woman loves a woman does not mean she loves any less than a woman that loves a man.  They (should) have every right to be happy with one another, and to be married to one another.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	It should be allowed. I think the bible should be BANNED though. A lot of hatred spewing out of that thing.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I think it should be allowed. If you love someone, then marry them. It doesn't matter what sex you are and what sex you love.|`|w3tNq8npaa	Let me start off by saying that i am straight.I think gays should be allowed to get married.Gays have feelings and sometimes they can't control them.Just like straight people.We are people,they are people.Why shouldn't they be able to get married?Some people say  "The bible says God made Adam and Eve,not Adam and Steve."But honestly,I don't care what the bible says.It was written over a million yrs ago so...yeah.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Nope!|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	I don't think it should be aloud. I think I will go with what the bible says:)|`|E6x6fYn5aa	people get hung up about the many meanings of marriage.  It means different things to different people in different religions.  To make matters worse we created a legal goverment defined union and gave it the exact same name -marriage.    Legal marriage should be redefined to not include sexuality and not be called marriage, save that term for religions.  Two siblings with no sexual interest in each other (hopefully) should be able to have a civil union where they agree to take care of each other, and pool their resources for the greater stability and security of both.  Why do people have to have sex in order to legally commit to take care of each other.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	I dont think it really matters.  There are much more important current events to waste time wondering if someone wants to marry the same sex.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	nobody has the say in who people should or shouldn't be with. they are people too. if this really is a free country, then let them get married. why is it anyone's business?|`|PDJjy0bPaa	I guess it could be "aloud" but it should certainly be allowed.  You love who you love.  I'm straight, but gay people are no different than straight.    Plus, not everyone is a Christian, so your views are not the only ones that count.|`|agTCqkLDaa	There's nowhere in the Bible that says that.    People who use that argument should read the Bible more closely AND read the parts about "not wearing mixed fibers" meaning if you have on a pair of jeans, Hello Satan or if you have on a pair of polyester pants and a cotton shirt, get your handbag ready and head down to the land of fire IF you are going to persecute a group of people and use scripture as your defense, you should follow the Bible to a tee.    If the Bible is NOT your argument and you just disagree with it then I believe it should be compromised such as Civil Unions with the same benefits and recognition or going to a church that accepts it.  That way, you get your union and tax breaks and people who disagree with gay marriage (not necessarily homophobic) can be at ease.    And it's not JUST Christians who are against gay marriage (actually, most Christians I know are totally for it), there are several Jews against it, don't even get me started on militant Islamists, etc.  Once again, not ALL, but it's not JUST the Christians.  I wish people would get off of that.      And I'm pretty sure that Britney Spears and her first brief marriage is not "upholding the sanctity of marriage" despite being heterosexual.|`|INkafu0uaa	well yes it should people are closed minded ! so of course they would think that! hey along time ago they didn't even want african americans to get married and look where were at now! so i do believe they should be aloud to get married no matter what closed minded people say! why should we care who they decide to marry! i mean do you  care if the guy down the street sister got married no! so why be concerned if homosexual do? and if they say the bible say this the bible says that then say the bible also say if your children are disobedient they should be beaten and if the wife is not a virgin when she Merry's the she shall be token to her father house and stoned to death! so maybe we should start doing all of this too! gay people should be aloud to get married!|`|444pPdy5aa	NO|`|aDL7xmt6aa	No, it should not be "aloud".  The question is, should it be "allowed".  And the answer is still no.  Stay in school.  It's your only hope.|`|claW4UUcaa	yes i believe it should. i see nothing wrong with it. i know a lesbian couple who have been together for 25 years one is injured and had to quit her job she can't get on her partners insurance because they aren't married. i think gay people who love each other should have marriage rights. why would straight miserable couples have a right and not the gays? i could ramble on about this forever. watch the gay marriage episode of family guy :)

ycNt74yyaa	I Want My Ex Back :  Rekindling His Love :  8 ways to get him to beg you to take him back    1.NEVER EVER cry to your ex and tell him that you want him back. it will only make you look pathetic. you should not beg..make HIM beg!  2. guys always want what they can't have! don't be too available,be mysterious and provocative.  3. when you do see him,LOOK YOUR BEST..always always look your best!make him realize what he had lost.  4. be sweet and friendly,but not just to him..but to everyone else too (friendly,NOT flirty!).but don't blab too much.  5. smile a lot,but don't be too cheesy. show him (or just pretend) how "content" your life is with or without him.  6. don't act stupid.be smart,be polite and don't overreact. treat him like he's any of your guy friend.  7. now that you're single..enjoy being one!go out with your friends!get a new hobby!be daring!talk to other guys (who knows..)!have fun!your ex will realize that you're really having fun only if you're not faking it.  8. once again..always look your best,be respectful and love yourself. people would only respect you and want to be a part of your life only if you took good care of yourself.|`|Y8MakQ2laa	Rastalove,    Right now your ex boyfriend knows he can have you whenever he wants.  There is a natural human tendency to take people for granted when you know they are totally available.... and your boyfriend is no different.  It's not that he is being cold or uncaring, it's just human nature to react this way.    It sounds like you're the one that is really pushing to get back together.  Back of and take a break for a bit.  I know this is hard because you're really anxious to get him back, but it's exactly these anxious feelings that may cause you to do things that are out of character for you.    if you come across as too needy, desperate of pushy, it will kill your chances of  getting back together.    Let him know you care and are open to getting back together, but don't throw yourself at him or chase after him.  Take a break and allow him some time to miss  you.  By backing off and making yourself somewhat unavailable, you make he worry that he may lose you forever... and this can work in your favor for sure.    There is definitely a right way and a very wrong way to go about this.  I posted a link to an excellent blog that goes into this in more detail.    I hope this helps.  Stay strong and I wish you the best!    Matt

I'm guessing he's still having the affair, or is having another one. Tell him it's time for counseling and to act like a married couple, or move out. He'll probably move.|`|	The only reason I slept on the couch was because I sawed the house down snoring!  But she went to 3rd shift and it didn't matter where I slept because we rarely, if ever, slept together anymore.     The thing about affairs is that the cheater looks for ways to shed the blame. Not acceptable!  Most will "lay low" and hope that they can eventually return to "Normal".  Not acceptable!  Weather you realize it or not you have the power in this situation.  If he is not living up to your expectations of rebuilding the marriage, send him packing.  You cant do this alone, go to counseling talk to him and if he still refuses to abide then get an attorney and end it.      Reality is that it will never be the same as it was. You and your H must work together to make it something new.  In the end, its totally up to you from here on.  He lost his vote when he stepped out on you.

ZKsSnT64aa	PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN WOMAN    IM A GUY AND I WITH A SON AND IM ENGAGED TO SOMEONE WHOS NOT HIS MOTHER AND SHE HAS TWO KIDS FROM A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE.    I WOULD NEVER TOLERATE MY SON OR HER KIDS TRYING TO PLAY ONE AGAINST THE OTHER. SHE WOULD NOT TOLERATE IT EITHER|`|7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	Yet another example of why people with young children shouldn't marry...    Here's what I would do... I would talk to the kids and the dad as a group.  I would say that from now on, if they have something to say, they should be willing to say it to you and your husband all at once.  This nit picky crap has to stop.  All they are doing is stirring things up, and they are probably doing it on purpose.  But you know that already.    Your husband is falling for their drama, plain and simple.  He's going to take their side... they are his kids, after all.  The easiest thing to do is to say that there will be no more sneaking behind your back.  If they think you've abused your daughter, that's the kind of thing that you bring out, not hide.  If you didn't say hi to them and they feel slighted, then they need to "man" up and say something in your presence.  Your husbands got to stop "feeding" them, you know?  His reactions are what they are after... but if he "mans" up and states that he won't hear accusations without you there to hear them... that will curtail all the drama.  Or at least, it'll make it less fun for them..    Good luck... God bless|`|mGKQY6OPaa	i think u should give them bastards to day care..straighten those ******* out..they **** with u you **** with them!|`|bO2rzfISaa	This is a copy of how I responded to Joseph's question:    My husband has two daughters, 9 and 13. Any time there is a conflict between me and the children he backs me up 100% and he gives the children NO latitude to cause problems in our marriage. I have children of a similar age and I am well-experienced at dealing with the behavior of girls that age. He trusts me to do the right thing and be the adult in the situation. It is a great gift that he gives to me in our marriage.    Why are you CONFRONTING your wife about conflicts with the children? Don't you trust that your wife is able to conduct herself as an adult with your children?    Your children's complaints sound childish, maybe because they are children|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You're right, as long as you don't do this in front of the children.  But if he's not open to your opinion, you're possibly wasting your time.      I think one of the most difficult aspects of remarriage is dealing with the children of prior marriages, especially when you bring your own children into it.  It isn't for anyone but the very stoutest.  Be strong and try to put your marriage on a pedestal in front of all of the children.  Perhaps your husband will take notice.|`|a4V2FjMQaa	Talk directly with the kids, with your husband at your side...ahve him and you voice your EQUAL concerns over this. this way they will see that you both agree it is out of hand.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	When they tell him something like that, he needs to say "Wait, let's ALL sit down together and discuss it." Most likely, it's real easy to lie behind your back, but real hard to do it to your face.

Rsww6L5qaa	Girls have a very hypnotizing effect on men, especially if they are naked.  Almost every time a guy sees a girl naked, it will drop his jaw.  This is true for guys across the board.  Guys usually don't think about how beautiful a girl might be though.  Because of their hypnotizing effect, guys usually try to figure out how to gain pleasure from the girl's image.    Yes, I do like to see naked girls, but I think that mystery and modesty is better.  If I am attracted to a girl for reasons beyond her looks, I will normally grow feelings of respect for her.|`|TKNPveHDaa	I love them.  Naked girls everywhere!  All naked and stuff!
	just forget about them u should not give a crap about what they think this is about u and your husband and if this does not work you should ask them y they r doing this to u. hope it works.
bDxFH1jyaa	ur not weak. those people who mock you just dont understand you... ignore them! i used to be a lot like you... but i learned that I was the one who needed to break down the walls, not other people. as soon as you have done that, people will be able to see you for the kind person you really are.

No one is going to approach a stone wall with a hammer and try to break it down, so you need to start chiseling your way out and meet people part way.  The sooner you do this the sooner the wall will come down. You have made a good start by saying that you have a problem, and now you need to fix the problem .|`|yuOuoCfDaa	It's not about them getting pass the walls.....it's about you letting those walls down, to someone at some point.|`|x5f6AqDBaa	same feeling here i would like many friends around the world u can contact me via mail and become my new friend :)|`|NnPJI27jaa	How can someone befriend you if they can't get through to you.  You need to tear down your 'walls'.  I know you have them for protection but they just make you appear aloof and uncaring.  You have to make the first move and buying a classic car won't help.    Go ahead take a chance, let yourself be vulnerable and soon you will reap the rewards.
niYixDU4aa	i don't know much about abuse...but it sounds like some sort of abuse.  that's really sad.  i don't know what to tell you other than, thank you.  i will never feel sorry for myself again for not being able to buy new clothes.|`|6T4SvlMOaa	you really gotta tell someone. mention it to you'r aunt again any that she wont buy you clothes. and evrything at school. and your dad as well.. maby ask HIM to take u both shopping? cause it sounds like he cares abit more *im not saying ur mum dont but she dusnt seem to asmuch*    u gotta tell them everything :S|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Tell her that you are going to talk to the school counselor and see what she thinks about it as it may amount to child abuse or neglect|`|EQPE72hpaa	Whatever you do, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, consult your counseler.

Hide it from your pathetic "mom" if you have to.|`|XR2BCYOSaa	tell your counselor  they can lose custody of you for that.  stupid people shouldn't breed.|`|BdDRkt7eaa	The question seems to me to be a little exaggerated, but that could just be me. No offense. I've never really experienced anything like this in my life, so it's hard for me to realise that it's real.    Like most of the others said, talk to your counselor. They should be able to provide some sound advice. Your aunt also seems like a good person to talk to. Explain your feelings to her and make her listen to your side of the situation. Tell her everything that's going on. This isn't some small mistake that can be put aside until later.    A horrible (but possible) thing to do would be to wear your mother's clothes (if you are the same size or close). It would be complete retribution, and she would should realise then that the only way to stop you wearing her clothes would be to get you some of your own.    The last thing that you could try doing would be to buy your own clothes with your own money. You could find a job and use your salary to buy clothes of your own. Since you aren't interested in the designer crap (good on you, by the way!), you should be able to get quite a lot from what you earn. And besides, no one knows your taste in clothes better than yourself, right?

Really, I'll tell you that in two weeks you will barely remember all of this.|`|I29W1pcwaa	I don't really know what to say - I've never had something like that happen. But maybe you could try looking at things from her perspective? That might help you see what you need to do. It's not an easy thing to do, but sometimes it's the best plan. From reading that email, I think your friend is feeling kinda resentful. Please don't take this badly, but to be perfectly honest I think she feels that you think you're better than her. Maybe you should talk it over with her, and if you need to say sorry don't be ashamed to. People make mistakes... I hope this didn't hurt your feelings, but I guess on here you can be perfectly honest. I do hope you can solve your problem, though! Best of luck!
af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	First, I think she is very irresponsible. It seems her only goal on life is to have kids without a job or father for the kids.     Second, I think we all need to be concerned with that fact that A single parent CAN"T properly raise a child not matter how hard they try. After all, how can she teach these kids any discipline and how can she teach these kids any respect for themselves (in the baby girls case) and respect for women (in the baby boys case). Fathers play a big role in the upbringing of a child, when they are absent most child end up being very rebellious and violent, some of them join gangs and/or commit crimes later in life.    Third, the cost this "woman" is unmarried has no job and lives with her parents (her mother disapproves of what she has done), this WILL cost California residents lots of money that the state doesn't have. Everyone. needs to know the average cost of a one child from time they are born until the age of 18 is 1 million dollars.    Forth, Is the issue of how much is a family this big gonna consume over a long period of time. And can others be able to properly raise their families if huge families keep "hogging" all the resources (over the life spam of these kids, this issue will be of greater concern).|`|PtACBQNgaa	ouuuch|`|LyZhJB1Baa	I bet she's Hispanic.

My only thought.... how will she manage to breastfeed 8 kids....|`|gX7KThhoaa	god bless her|`|dEIyGq1yaa	theres no way to predict of your going to have octuplets. maybe she never wanted 8 more children. just 1. or they made a mistake...|`|GahpE5U2aa	I am against it. This was not a natural birth. She went through fertility treatment.    She lives with her parents. She already has six kids who share 2 or 3 bedrooms. And now she has 8 more?    It's child abuse, is what it is. How will these children be looked after? I feel so bad for the grandparents too.|`|okXexAbIaa	I think it's going to be a huge drain on the taxpayers.  She clearly has a screw loose.  She is having kids with no father in the picture and I'm certain she expects the government to provide for her and the kids....it's all very sad indeed!|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I think that that woman and her doctors are a shame to our society. What doctor in their right mind would allow this young, poor, single woman already with SIX kids to have EIGHT more!!!!     She is just trying to sell her story and be like Jon and Kate plus Eight and the Duggars, except those people are actually somewhat nomal and don't get government assistance.|`|vjvx4k9Uaa	I heard the same thing on the radio. I she probably didn't even want to have 8 more kids. She probably needs her family for money support of course. I think It's fine as long as her family is okay with it.   I hope she's ok though... I mean 14 kids?  there's already one with 17!|`|TcuRYwiwaa	She's single, lives with her mother, and already has six children. Not only that it was artificial insemination. I think the whole thing is ridiculous. Now if she had a husband/boyfriend and financial stability I wouldn't care, but seeing as how she has none of those concerns me. How will she pay for 14 children? And I'm pretty sure not many men would want to be with a woman that has that many children.|`|Mx33cku8aa	the thing is, her family no longer wants to support her. not that i'm an advocate for marriage in order to "properly raise" children. but there's a lot to be said for providing a broad and stable support system to yourself as a parent and especially for your children. granted she wanted all of the kids, which is a great start that some children never have. yet there just seems to be a certain element of responsibility that isn't being acknowledged by the mother.|`|iCLGHUdQaa	What disturbs me about this octuplet story is that this woman had invitro for every single pregnancy.  And the fact that there is no "partner" (man or woman, I don't care) and she and her herd of children live with her parents.    This is VERY different than the Duggars.  I just have this feeling that something is going to come up later, something that makes this story even more odd than it already is.|`|ZArYUIMcaa	i thinks ita a gift from god  thats so great to me|`|LWwGW48Daa	Crazy *&^%$|`|Bt3857hxaa	I think there crazy!...By the time they get rid of the last child.

If something were to happen to the mother then who could care for 14 children? That is certainly a lot to handle. I don't know what I'd do. How could anyone support them all? If you have seen the TV show Jon and Kate + 8 then you know that their lives are extremely hectic. Although, I think with the right mother and the right dosage of love they will all be just fine!|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	I would love to have octuplets as well!

However, she has made history with this birth and I hope it turns lucrative for her.  The "sperm donor" is married to another woman.      Ms. 6+8 is gonna need the money from any book, movie, or scientific research that comes of this.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I don't think much of her. She is only 33. She already has six kids aged 2 through 7. Her mom said she disapproved of here getting inseminated. Her mom said she has been obsessed with having kids since she's a teenager. She lives with her parents. Her mom should have told her that if you keeps having kids you better find somewhere else to live. The house is so tiny. At least the Duggars have a big home and can afford all those kids. It is different when you are married. How is this woman going to take care of 14 kids. How could she possibly afford that? It isn't a miracle. It's fertility. Humans aren't meant to have litters.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	shes a moron, gonna be using tax payers money for the rest of her life to support them, she should of stopped at 3|`|V1MptCMiaa	I think she's an idiot, and she better not be asking the state or country or whatever for money to help her.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I think theres to many people in this damn world as it is and theyre adding to the problem.

	keep in mind people with ptsd cant feel love cause they dont love themselves half the time,  It is also a low selfesteem problem.  You need to fix u then u will see your wife truely loves u and u lover her.  I know from experience ptsd is not fun, i to have it and used to blame my hubby for my unhappiness but slowly i am healing and becoming more relaxed.  Go out right now and get some self help books or do counseling.  Exercise is good to.  Look up some info on the internet that will help your spouse deal with what your going thru.  I did and it seemed to help my hubby understand.  Stick with your wife , shes is just scared .|`|	Counseling, and make her aware of your problem.|`|	Tell her the truth. It can't hurt more than it is hurting you both now.|`|	Nothing wrong with that.     You may be delighted to know that you are not REQUIRED to automatically have feelings (of love or desire) for anyone.    If a woman can't INSPIRE you to have feelings for her ... is it really YOUR problem?    If you pay close attention, you will notice that women do very little to inspire men to have feelings for them. But they have no problem EXPECTING you to have feelings for them - automatically.    When a woman is not prepared to make an EFFORT to be loveable - how is that YOUR problem?    FACT: You don't owe women personal happiness.    You only owe that to -->> YOURSELF.|`|	You also cant use this condition for an excuse for everything.

AA11618874	I have never seen the movie and I'm not going to watch it on www.watch-movies.com and get back to you as soon as I'm done with an accurate answer to this question. So far there really is only one way to "finger" a woman. BRB in a couple hours. I'm curious!     After finally finding a way to watch the movie without having to rent it I saw what you meant. Annabelle might not have been "fingering simone but merely rubbing simone's clitoris and general vaginal region. The movie filmed it in such a way that we are meant to let our own imagination take over. Essentially the screenwriter wanted the viewer to see that they were "sensual" without having to go into the fine detail by detail coreography of it. From what I could tell, Simone was on bottom kissing Annabelle and stroking her thighs while Annabelle was touching Simone's vaginal region and there was def. some mutual raw nude breast clashing going on.     That's what I could see. I hope this was the answer you needed. The screenwriter purposefully made it like that to make you know that they were touching eachother sensually.
AA10471068	Okay, here's my thoughts. I work with drug addicts, alcoholics and men  & women with PTSD. There is one thing most alcoholics and addicts have in common. Trying to get over!! Right now she's trying to get over on you. I think it's great that you have taken on the responsibility of going ahead and raising your children like a real man.  I don't know how  young you were when you got married but, it seems to me that she's trying to recapture her youth. Sometimes doing the right thing for all the  wrong reasons has a way of biting you in the ***. Addicts and alkies  both have severe mood swings and being dx as bipolar she can really   have you twisted.  Look, count your loses and cut the chain of dependency.  Good luck with the kids.|`|mKCiofUFaa	I am so sorry to hear that you are experiencing this but on the other hand a bit relief that I am not alone. You see, I dated a man who is bipolar. He did the same thing as your wife did, except, he was upfront and honest about it. Yes, he's always the one to mess around and then make it sound like I am the one he has problems to trust.     The problem with this illness is real, it has taken lives and ruined lives. If the individual doesn't want to get help, there is nothing you can do for them. In your case, it's hard because you have kids together.     She will change her mind back and forth and it won't change unless she is dedicated to taking medications, seeing a psychiatrist, a counselor and doing meditations. It's a rough battle and it requires all her energy just focusing on herself. They cannot afford more energy in taking care of your kids or you or anything else.     Sad to say, if you love her, you will let her go. Let her find her sanity back because she won't be able to find it if she has her previous responsibilities. She is no longer able to be your wife now.     The good thing is, by setting her free, you are also freeing up yourself for a better future. A better future for you and your kids. My heart goes out to them. I hope they are dealing with this okay. After all, they are the most vulnerable in this situation.    Some bipolars can't even hold down a job...some took their lives, some...did worse thing. Just be thankful that things are not already worse than they are.    You must find strength...meditation will help, if you find it hard, just do it once a day. Try and keep still and breathe for 1 minute. Focus on the breathe and clear your mind. 1 minute a day..slowly increasing to 1 more minute the next day.    Once you are still, you will find answers. Best wishes to you.|`|EoPZnFZlaa	Equally important, do YOU want to remain married? She definitely needs some help if even half of what you say is true.  Perhaps she felt you weren't there for her emotionally and that brought on the loss of trust. At any rate, it's a shame for your children, and I can totally relate due to a very similar situation in  my own life. My step-son's mother is bi-polar and fast and loose with her meds (I call her my wife-in-law) and its a constant roller-coaster of stress which is hardest on EJ. The most important things are the kids. If living together is turbulent, with a lot of fighting the best thing for them would be to stay apart.  I know a lot of kids who were glad their parents divorced and they got a more peaceful environment.  Ask yourself: what can I live with?  What can I no longer tolerate? and most importantly; Are the kids better off with me alone?  And answer them honestly, unselfishly, and thoughtfully.  Good luck to you and yours, May Goddess bless you|`|RjpPzbBJaa	BiPolar is no joke, its a serious mental illness. My husband is BiPolar and it can wreck havoc on a marriage.  If she is not willing to get treatment, from a psychiatrist, then there is nothing you can do for her. BiPolars are often addicted to drugs or alcohol and sexually promiscuous. They also deny their illness until the usually hit rock botton and realize they need help.  I would at very least separate from her. Make sure you get full custody and allow her supervised visitation. IF she decides to get help, then you two can attend marital counceling from there, but if she refuses help, it will be a constant up & down because that is what BiPolar causes.|`|8tJPK69iaa	She didn't really want counseling. Why she told you that you may never know. For the sake of your sanity and your children's, move on. She is out for a good time and does not want the responsibility of being a spouse or parent.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Her behavior does sound like classic bipolar. One of my late aunts was bipolar and did nearly the very same things that you are describing about your wife. Until she gets help she really can't help her behavior right now. Since you are still legally her husband it is possible that you could go to court and have a judge declare her incompetent into a hospital where she can be put on medication that will help bring her back down to where she might could be a little more reasonable. Once you divorce her the ball will no longer be in your court.  I don't know what the laws governing this are in Pennsylvania but this is how it goes in good ole Arkie. My mother and aunt always had to do this when my aunt went off of her meds or just her meds needed to be changed. This could very well be the in sickness and in health part of marriage vows. You are within your rights as well to go on and divorce her because she is so chemically imbalanced right now you need to protect your children.|`|AA11085356	People who are bipolar can go from one extreme (counseling) to the next (divorce) in a matter of minutes. Until she seeks medical help, you probably wont be able to tell what it is that she really wants. If I were you I would stick with the divorce. Try talking her into getting the help she needs. Once she is on the proper medication, she will be able to function properly and live a normal life again. Once she's at that point you can discuss her having time with the children. Hang in there, it's probably not going to be easy. But you have to look out for you and your children, they come first. She needs to work on taking care of herself.    I hope this helps, and good luck to you!|`|KbZIsj7Caa	OK J...she is Bipolar, that explains alot, but if you wish to continue going through the same thing over and over again,, get the help, but it's not going to work, it hasn't for 18 months. You really need to think about the children now and move on and let her go, and you're right, she does need help and medication. ok think about this..lets say you try again with her, and a few months everything is fine, but out of the blue, shes gone and left you and the kids  again, and you will feel that pain all over again and so will the kids. why put the kids through that. ok here's another one, why would you want her back knowing of all the men she's been with. she's done things with those men that she hasn't done with you. OK one more for the road..knowing that she's bipolar, she could one day snap and hurt you or the children physically. Is that what you want? I know you're still in love with her, but its time to let go and really move on. Please make the right decision for your kids sake, they deserve to grow up safe and happy.|`|8nGZV6ufaa	She is bi-polar, and it sounds like she is far from "treated".  One thing they do when they go so far out, is try to shift the blame so to speak...So hence, she stirs up the blame game and the "I've lost trust in YOU."   Gets your head stirring, even when you KNOW you've been a good guy.  Its possible she will shift her thoughts again, that is about the only certainty you ever have with a person like this.  You have tried, and now are slowly gaining the ability to move forward, (stick w/ that plan)...They kind of start to wig out when the person they were with really starts showing that they don't NEED them anymore.  Its a hard phase of this mess to get through...But stand your ground.  This is your life, not hers...she doesn't make YOUR rules.  Live life like you know that.  Take care, and wish you well.|`|H5NVYoNOaa	dude just move on and hope for the best when she comes to see the kids.|`|Jwzq6NAZaa	I would go to therapy. Even though you didn't do anything and she has been all over the board, knowing that you are willing to work on the marriage may be the sign she needs, may be she just wants to play the victim.     Go to therapy. If nothing else, you can walk away from the craziness knowing that you did everything in your power to save your marriage. BTW-you may be willing to move on but what about your kids. There will definitley be issues with the kids, therapy may help them through this situation as well.|`|f220e96318031247c325d10ca20ba587aa	I think that you should just let her go...I don't think its right to get treated that way and well for the kids..you can do it yourself...on the Other hand maybe going to counseling will help her with her problems and if you really can't trust her anymore than do it for the kids you know?Look to tell you the truth kids go through a lot when  parents aren't together especially if the mother is away..if you really want her to let go than forget her and draw your attention to your kids...
hgPmwYAfaa	it's something simple sweet one rose....with a card and all the reasons you married her...a small foil wrapped chocolate heart...that is in a special place...that has a note...i love you!..it's not about money or schedules.. it the thought that counts.... and she may just be flat tired and need to rest...|`|01GbQLZwaa	take a fake vacation. whether you get a hotel room the next town over or just stay at home and turn off all phones. You need to reset your relationship. Think of things you could do together like cook dinner together. Cook something new that you will need a recipe for so it calls for everyone to show interest and then after dinner play a card game or a board game. I also use boredom questions....what was you favorite hiding place as a kid. who was you first friend. and don't stress to much together about the financial issue the economy sucks and everyone is feeling it. One couple worrying constantly about how to fix it will just cause stress. Working as a team and finding ways to get around it will bring you guys closer together and take away some of the stress. And to work through the loss of common interest you simply need something you guys can do together that will help you spend time together. Movie nights work good. or cheap outings like showing up on her break time with a cup cake and some coffee. don't forget your 1 year old. spending time as a family will help bring you guys together now so these issues wont appear at another time in your baby's life...good luck|`|cDubFtwlaa	whipped cream cherrys and a paddle in bed|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	Bring her home some flowers and take her to the most romantic restaurant.

When you're there give her a dozen red roses and take her out for a nice dinner and give her nice lingerie.|`|WA8feS8taa	Well valentines day is coming up so why don't you take her out to dinner or something? A dinner with her favorite foods or take her to her favorite restaurant. Just plan a really special evening for her, she'll love it.|`|44mmJ14Caa	I KNOW THAT ALL I NEED WHEN I FEEL LIKE THAT IS FOR MY MAN TO LAY DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH ME AND HOLD ME REALLY TIGHT AND KISS MY HEAD AND TELL ME HOW MUCH HE LOVES ME AND FOR ME TO BE IN HIS ARMS....JUST AN EVENING OF NOTHING BUT U AND HER TIME TALK, WATCH A MOVIE, HOLD EACH OTHER, FALL IN LOVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITS THE BEST FEELING EVER|`|bwZPqoYhaa	You need alone time ( I don't mean just sex). Make her feel special.  Once kids come, its all about kids, husband, house, finance.  You have to look back before all of that when you were dating.  What kind of fun, exciting things did you do then.  Recreate them now.|`|RzZBU8elaa	well hang on to each other. and dont make love to her. ask how she is feeling|`|Jgh0h5Odaa	First, clean the house.  Or at least help out if you don't normally.  Find a new common interest or try something that she enjoys.  Be sure to get a babysitter at least one night a month and take her out.  Just be sweet and be sure that she knows she is appreciated.  Say thank you. Rub her feet.  When she looks like hell, bad hair, baby spit, etc., tell her how hot she is.|`|8tJPK69iaa	I would be extremely WOWed if my husband cleaned the house and made dinner. The sex would be great.|`|Leda2ha0aa	Do those simple things gentlemen use to do when they were dating their now wives.  Open the door to the car, tell her how pretty she looks, just give her a nice smile when you are across the room from her and you catch her eye.  Those little things mean a heck of a lot more than buying her something.  My husband use to do them when we were dating and once in a while he may remember, and it brings back old feelings of dating each other.    If you need to buy her something, take her on a weekend to a place with a spa.  I use to laugh when people would say they just wanted to go to a spa - I now understand what they mean.  It's nice to be pampered when all you think about is your husband and kids.    Nice that you want to "wow" her!|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Clean the house from top to bottom, make her dinner and do all the laundry.  If you have kids, take them out for a day and let her relax and have the house to herself.
K6JSNQJQaa	Well Jason, I guess it depends on what type of problems you're having.  Space and time to think things trough are always good.  It gives you time to reflect on the problem and time to calm down before you say something you might regret later on.   Also making sure you understand the "root" of the problem will help you figure things out too.  Sometimes we let other issues interfere with the problem at hand.  The ability to communicate with your partner will makes easier to work through those issues.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	what's best is to keep communicating or you will never really fix the problem.|`|QCmRRbABaa	Depend on the problem, a temporal separation could help to put ideas in order,...|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I'm not married but my boyfriend of three and a half years are planning to. Not sure if this could help. But everytime we have a huge fall out, we would go into this mode where we don't call or message or speak to or see eachother for a week or two. It seemed to work well for the first few times because you start to miss eachother and more importantly, forget that you were totally in rage.    But, after a while, it seemed like I was always the one who calls him back first. It's really not fun at all. And the same problem happens again and again and again...     I guess if you need to calm down, being away from eachother is a good way to do that. But just make sure you take turns calling the other person back first. And make sure you actually discuss and solve the problem after both of you have calm down.    Being away from eachother is only good to calm down without saying or doing things that you will regret later. But it's certainly not the way to solve problems. It's only a temporary escape.
nz8o3lLSaa	Its a part of evolution.  Men want to pass their genes on.  Women want a man that will stick around and protect their family.  Society has attempted to switch this around and make the male feel guilty for adultery and the woman more open to sleeping around (as there are many benefits to this).    And the one circumstance I can think of where it is okay to cheat is if the man is in prison.  He needs protection in jail.|`|upk2Hzeeaa	I think it's because they learn what little they know about being a real man from porn and rap stars.  Part of taking care of your girlfriend/wife is loving her wholeheartedly and that means you don't care about any other girls!    I'm probably older than most of the other people here but I have to point out that I know way more women who have cheated on their husbands than men who have cheated on their wives.|`|bc6MlMyoaa	It could be because because they like the thrill of doing something that's viewed as wrong.    Another possibility is that they are comfortable with the idea of being polyamorous, but do not know how to express that feeling with their girlfriend / wife.    Western society, at least, has been pushing for monogamous relationships as the norm for centuries, despite evidence that humans might not be naturally monogamous.  This leads to the concept of 'cheating,'  the idea that once you're in a relationship, the other person should be the sole focus of your emotional and sexual attention.  This places undue stress on individuals to please their partners, when in reality, both sides can still remain 'significant others' while having multiple sexual partners.|`|mXwO9xmCaa	I sure dont!!|`|AA10913583	it could be because they are not satisfied enough with their current relationship and think they could get away with it.|`|feUMAvgLaa	I don't think its okay to cheat, only jerks cheat!|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	dont judge all guys because of a few cases.    im a guy an i dont think its ok to cheat at all. no one i know does either. people make mistakes    if a guy thinks its ok to cheat then they should be alone for the rest of their lives =/|`|rIFqv8nvaa	dont want rude answers yet you ask a rude, inceribly biased question.

They do it because they need to be reaffirmed.|`|TMfXrnQFaa	i have to say from personal experience that cheating only happens when the love has gone or was never strong or true from the beginning,when you are head over heels in love with your girl belive me there is not another person on the planet who comes close.The notion that guys think its ok to cheat is not really true,but we think its ok when the feelings are no longer there.|`|ptgng2RFaa	if i know i can get away with it then i will, but its not that im not happy, its just being with someone different and being able to do things that your girlfriend wont do, woman do it to,  no strings fun,,|`|Jevw5cbqaa	Because guys only want sex.

Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	well its either he doesn't care oh you're turning kinda gay and he was already gay that is why you cant stop|`|iNC2Yimlaa	I think it's perfectly normal to enjoy tickling someone and (at times) fantasize about tickling a friend or acquaintance. There's nothing wrong with you. You're just one of the millions of people (like myself) who enjoy tickling. There have been occasions in my life when I've seen a young lady barefoot and thought about what it would be like to give her soles a good tickling. I wouldn't worry too much about your thoughts of tickling your friend. It's not something that your probably going to be able to get rid of. Besides why would you? You're not hurting anyone. Just accept it. You'll be better off. Trust me. You may want to try actually tickling your friend. If you find that you both enjoy it then the two of you will have something new do engage in. Good luck to you.|`|6Z91jdchaa	Well  , ask him if he minds it . If your close it shouldn't be that bad|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	It's not the easiest thing in the world to stop oneself from wanting things.  Within the context of a penchant for tickling it's probably normal enough.  Some people crave tickling only in a particular context.  If you happen to be a Friend Tickler and only a Friend Tickler, it may be difficult to stop craving a prime opportunity.  One thing you might do is to see if you can incorporate tickling into your dating life and see if you like that better.  That's the only thing that comes to mind at the moment.  Then again, if both you and your friend are enjoying getting a good laugh out of it, then just keep having fun.|`|xhDdYnHTaa	I think it's normal to tickle your friends, especially when you know they're really ticklish!  How can someone resist??  :-)|`|LuqtCMCoaa	well, if you guys are close and he doesn't mind, why stop?|`|B2WyO7gjaa	lol..    it depends on how he will take it    my bf is very ticklish but hates being tickled
78ed5d71dd73eb5414eaaf0f5e5cb89aaa	Me and my husband both do it, either together or alone. We feel no guilt or shame about this because we view it as a normal activity. It's not a disrespect to your partner and it doesn't mean something is lacking in your sex life.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Try it with your partner, it will feel good for both of you getting each other off or mutual masturbation as it's referred to.|`|SzQi9N7daa	**** away!!       Been married 15 years and we both have our private moments!|`|AA11825142	LOL, we both still do!  I think its healthy and wouldn't worry unless you prefer doing you and forget about her!|`|cdc7657df2e84910de282c72779d833eaa	Yes, married people still masturbate.  Though intimacy between married people is a wonderful way to emotionally connect, as humans we are sexual creatures.  Even without the partner, we still have needs and desires (to be rude, "need to scratch an itch").  Masturbating is a way to do that without the emotional and physical issues of cheating.  During the fantasy phase of masturbation, it is a way to indulge in trying on different sexual ideas without trying them physically, as well as a way to relieve the sexual tension.  It is documented that men tend to masturbate more than women (due to higher amounts of certain hormones), but women are discovering masturbation without shame as well.  You may want to broach the subject of mutual masturbation during sex to "liven things up", and also realize that, for women, if things are not okay OUTSIDE the bedroom, it tends to show in the bedroom in lower sexual contact and intimacy.  However, if masturbation begins to take the place of actual physical intimacy in the relationship, there may be a problem that needs to be addressed.  Take care and God bless.|`|21TogLbJaa	yes still human after we get married|`|Rjx4KwaYaa	yes its completely natural      answer mine please|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	I do and he does. Sometimes we watch eachother.|`|444pPdy5aa	Prob more often.    Every married man is deperate|`|gfHutvEFaa	married people still masturbate. We do it together usually. Sometimes just for something a little different. Fun!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Yes it's good that's why.|`|x02jsjg6aa	Married people still masturbate- men and women.  Masturbation is a part of life, not even necessarily a substitute for sex.  I enjoy masturbation, I also enjoy sex.  Yes I "prefer" a live partner but it's lots of fun to be by myself, too.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Anyone who says no is lying
DTUOvJm0aa	lol im sorry but this made me laugh.    we (or at least i ) don't care if you take a glance randomly. but if we're having a conversation and you're looking at the girls instead of my eyes for long periods of time, then yes. we tend to get irritated.    and sometimes we can't avoid walking around if our nipples get hard. a lot of the time, we don't notice unless we have goosebumps. i know i usually don't.     And yes, sometimes it's flattering if a guy takes glances at our breasts. Usually though if it's our boyfriend though. Anyone else, it's a bit creepy. But we also know you are just being guys when you look. just don't make it a staring contest.|`|E9TqDn5maa	Do girls ever look down there? How does that make you feel? It depends on who it is. When the guy I liked did it to me I liked being noticed but when other guys do it it's creepy.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	To me, it's no offensive...boobs are attention getters.  Heck even straight women glance at each others boobs all the time.|`|Izv6Qj4caa	i have big chest and its really funny when boys stare when im talking to them or when they notice my cleavage..i only get offended when they try  to touch..esp..if im not feeling them like that..  its embarassing when my nipples or on hard..lol so i try to hide that if they ever are..so no, i dont walk around..hoping that sum guy would notice that..  but its ok to look!!..my opinion|`|KifasiMraa	Girls do notice and they will always remember you as the guy who was blatantly glancing down at their breasts while they were talking to you.  If you're talking to a girl and you're interested in what she's saying, it shouldn't be that hard to keep your eyes straight ahead.  Focus on her face.  Quit being a douche.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	You can bet that when you meet a girl that is walking around with nipples sticking out that   Number 1 -  she knows it and  Number two she wants you to look and   Number three - you will look there first if those nipples are sticking out , you just can't help it some women even look  an  number 4 - she knows you will probably never even notice any flaws she thinks she has .|`|cxVmq2kraa	We ALWAYS notice if someone is looking at our boobs.  Sure sometimes but a lot of the time we want to punk you.

I mean, I've seen women who show a lot of cleavage, but not all their breasts. So where are you when you're glancing at their breasts? Are you at home with them at your house? Or do you look at your neighbors with binoculars?
AA11784965	Good Luck with you venture; I hope it works out well for you, Robert!
OUIAspBUaa	Break it off with him. You obviously don't feel the same way about him. Why be with someone you don't want? Yes, it will hurt him. You just have to do what is best for you. He wants things his way and that just isn't how a relationship works. He sounds very jealous and obsessive. If he can't handle remaining friends then too bad for him. You deserve to be happy in a relationship. It goes both ways, not just his.|`|gypWPBvLaa	well... its kinda hard to say i would rather not get dumped on my b-day so mabey say you cant go to it and then break up with him tomorrow cause if you do it on his b-day it might scar him badly and that is true i am still scared from being dumped by a girl i thought i loved on my b-day|`|hnQdOJDqaa	Okay,don't tell him today.I mean,today's his b-day.Tell him maybe tomorrow or so.Tell him exactly how you feel.If you two can't work it out from there I think it's best you break up with him.*|`|GRXEvvCTaa	i would cause when other guys want something fron u they just want to take adventege of u sooo when u break up with him make sure ur not alone cause he might attack u trust me! or u can do wat he says but if i were u i would brake up cause if ur going to have a bf u have to love him and he has to love u and not get mad 4 no reason!|`|mhtGDBhVaa	Let it go for about a week or too, or just until you cannot take it anymore. But definitely do NOT break his heart today. You will ruin his birthday, and he'll never forget it. Sometimes the butterflies aren't needed in a relationship. Butterflies are just the WOW in a relationship, and it shows that you know him more and that's why you don't feel a spark any longer.|`|SvIBu4yRaa	you don't like him so you need to end things before he takes it too seriously and you end up hurting more. but don't do it tonight because it's his birthday and that would just be straigh up wrong. go to the party but dont do anything that will lead him on. then tomorrow morning let him know how you feel and dont be an a** about it.|`|SRJ5HH1Yaa	Definitely break up with him girl!

But not on his b-day. it may be cruel to play him today, but just wait until tomarrow. give him one more happy day, and a b-day should be a happy day anyways.    I had a bf who skipped my b-day, and technicly could consider that we broke up that day, at least mentally.  And now, when i think of my b-day, I just remeber the hurt.|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	You should break up with him now. but on his birthday could be little too harsh.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	Well long story short 2 points.|`|XP36zr63aa	if you dont feel a connection with him and if hes annoying to you then you should break up with him, but do it sooner rather than later because that will only make things harder for him.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	If you really had to ask this question, yes, break up with him. It's not fair that he's in a relationship with someone who doesn't share mutual feelings. Plus, he's clingy and a little controlling. That gets old fast.     However, don't break up with him tonight. It would just ruin his birthday, so try doing it tomorrow. And if you REALLY don't want to go to his party, just make up an excuse.

fL8CIA2Xaa	move on, she did...No sloppy 2nds,|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	"she dumped because i always insulted her "--and she should have.  You don't mistreat the people you are supposed to care about regardless of how old you are.    If you don't learn to respect the females you choose to be with then you will either wind up dumped an awful lot or you'll wind up with women who will mistreat and use you the way you mistreat and use them.    Don't worry about your ex.  I don't think she's a whore but I do think she's got serious issues and you don't need to be messed up with her.  (she's a 19 year old woman dating an immature 17 year old child and now she's chasing daddy in a 39 year old lover---chick is seriously messed up and has issues.)|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Get over yourself, and move on!|`|AA11825142	She is your ex who cares!

She's obviously more mature than you.|`|AA11969451	Don't worry about what she is doing, she is your ex...move on, she has.   When a young man sleeps around he is a hero and when a young woman does the same she is a whore. NOT FAIR!!!|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	You said it yourself.    You're 17. Still in the eyes of society a child. Not ready to take on the responsibilities of the world.    Kick her to the curb and move on with your life. She doesn't deserve you. You can do better.    Just be glad she isn't pregnant.|`|21TogLbJaa	dont worry about she is your ex get my meaning your ex she can do whats she likes you are only 17 to young to be worrying about ex girls go get a new one to worry about
DcVoq5Tuaa	just about anything I bring home will be gone within a matter of hours. Ihave 3 boys and they eat everything in sight. I bought about 25.00 worth of grapes/apples and oranges this past Monday and they were gone by 9 pm Monday night. They do the same if I buy any chips, crackers or other snack food. No matter how much I tell them to spread it out and not eat it all at once, it would last longer, but they don't care, So I make it where I will only buy things 1 time a month and when it's gone, they have to wait until the next month. I can't keep buying food for all of us if it's gone in a matter of hours. My only daughter says "Mom, the brother's are pigs".|`|AA10240238	Ice Cream Sandwiches, if my son comes over.|`|RBQrgByeaa	My wife literally drinks two 2-ltrs of Diet Pepsi a day!
AA11425983	Just make that first step before you even think about it. If you wait until you are thinking about whether you should or shouldn't, then you're more likely not to.

HcdxxFlZaa	just listen to your heart and make the right decision.your parents should meet him as soon as possible,who knows,they might start to like him.if you're really in love with him,let your parents know how you feel about him and show them that he's the right guy for you.also,let your parents know how much you love them,that you won't disappoint them,but in the same time you feel hurt if they don't accept him and your feelings towards him.your happiness is all that really counts.sooner or later they will have to understand and accept this.best wishes and good luck! :)|`|yuwjQjKqaa	How do you know if the would not approve?

B) You THINK you are in love. You most likely are not...  C) They have been there and done that.     They know more than you do about this stuff. Listen to them.
SovaFpN8aa	Don't worry about getting married. You are putting the horse in front of the  cart when you are worrying about having children. Too many people confuse sex with love. They should be related, but you cannot substitute sex for love. You need to work on figuring out your plan for your future. Don't stress out about finding a girl to marry. Stay true to your beliefs and associate with fellow Christians. Some day, when you are not looking for her, you will run into the right girl. Get to know her. Date her. Learn to love her and value her for who she is and what she believes. You will grow and you will come to a time that you know it is right to marry her. This might take years. Once you have found the right girl, and you have built a strong relationship on faith and love, and you are married, then the sex will be the most satisfying thing you have ever experienced. Every time you have sex, you are giving a little piece of heart to that person, and she to you. This is why people who sleep around end up unsatisfied, they have given up parts of themselves to people who do not love them, and eventually promiscuity will kill a person's joy for life. Take your time, do it right, your joy will last a lifetime!|`|b26NgqOFaa	I think your problem is that you have not found the right person. You are very young.  You don't have any business even wanting to be married right now IMO.  But I would guess this is the reason for your feelings toward marriage. I think your real question is how to be a Christian and "walk the walk" and still have sex before marriage because you're probably not willing to wait until you find the right person- which most people aren't.    You have to be true to yourself and you have to be careful.  You may eventually meet the woman you want to be your wife.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	truly religious people remain celibate and adopt if they want kids but not marriage.    If you don't understand something about why your faith says to do something a certain way then ASK.  If you want to know something ASK.  Have your youth minister tell you why marriage is so special and WHY you should wait for sex in marriage.  (in general, most religions view marriage as a sacrament and sex is how you worship God through your spouse)    You don't sound like you like females all that much, that's fine.  don't date.  Figure out what you want in life, don't put any pressure on yourself to have certain things by a certain timeline.  Figure out what you want and who you are and if your religion speaks to you or not.  you sound like you have some spiritual growing to do and relationships may just be in your way right now and a distraction to that growth.   Good Luck.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Study the Bible on marriage..Ephesians Chapter 5..start there..and ask the Youth Pastor if you can have a group Bible study on the importance of marriage and how it works..|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You could adopt... I guess. You aren't supposed to have SEX outside of marriage. Nobody said anything about kids.   In your case, stay single, and stay a virgin if you really want to honor God. That's what they tell us at church, anyway. If you don't want to be married or devote your life to God by becoming a clergy member, you stay single and celibate. You could do something that involves working around kids or with them if you want. Why would you want kids but no marriage or girlfriend? It's hard to live like that... I've been there.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	It is written in John 3:6 That you must be born again. I have noticed that many people have churchianity and not true Christianity. If you are walking in the flesh, the Bible and anything it says will be very hard to understand as it is also written, let those who have eyes see and those who have ears hear, meaning that the Bible is the word of God for believers and that once you are born again you will understand it. Until then, you will never understand the whole marriage part from a biblical viewpoint. The Lord can change you if you let Him.    For years I was not a true believer. I was a feminist with an attitude. Since I have been born again (saved) the Lord has changed me in ways I never thought of. Now I am a married woman who lets my husband run the household.|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	No one said you had to get married but I personally believe: no marriage, no kids. Kids need both a mother & a father, why would you go out of your way to deprive them of that?    For me, the only exception to this would be if I were to adopt or foster a child.    Granted that many marriages end in divorce, which I'm sure traumatizes the children, but I think most people today jump into marriage without really considering how suitable /compatible their husband / wife is  and without realizing that a good marriage takes work, it does not just happen magically. These days it iseems like it is all about self-gratification, and an attitude like that is dangerous in a marriage.    The church should spend more time devising a Bible-based approach to teaching young people how to pick a life partner and how to make a marriage work.|`|WL61ZzYhaa	I am 21 too, and I am a christian.  I am also married (coming up on 2 1/2 years).  I met my wife in middle school, and we "dated" until we were actually old enough to be in a relationship.  I don't look at her a my wife all the time, but when i have any time to do what i want, I want to spend time with her.  She is my best friend, not a piece of meat that is a pain to be around.  As far as having kids without being married, there is alternatives like adoption or foster care, but i think it is unfair to the child to be without one parent or the other.  Marriage and raising a family go hand in hand.  I wouldn't have one without the other.|`|8p31dENPaa	I'm 25 years old and a Catholic. While I wasn't brought up in a strict Catholic household, the value of marriage and waiting until you were in love to have sex was impressed upon me. I was also told, that sex is an important part of your relationship. My mom said, "Don't wait until your wedding night to have sex." Now many people feel this was inappropriate for a mother to tell her daugther, but she also taught me to value myself and not hop into bed with the first guy. I waited until I was in love, 7 months into our relationship. I don't regret waiting until I was 25, we don't regret waiting 7 months, and we don't regret making love. I've been with my boyfriend (who is turning 30) for almost a year now. We waited until we were in love and in a committed relationship before making love. I know it goes against the Bible to have premarital sex, but we love each other, we have trust, honesty, communication and love in our relationship. It was a decision that we made together to have sex.
ngbFVluiaa	everyone has many friendships growing up, some will last and some won't.  as a friend you will look worse if you are needy and demand that kodi is better friends with you.  maybe you could be less reliant on her and find other people to speak to.  not only will this give you a wider set of friends, but it will raise your social standing, and most likely make your friend kodi want to spend more time with you again.|`|vLRrmVXMaa	both you and brooklynn can be friends with kodi. no one "owns" her. sometimes we just have to accept that new people come along and join our group of friends. if kodi starts to be rude to you though, and brooklynn is involved, maybe you need some new friends.

Now I know why your treated like a 5 year old... grow up a little and your Mom will give your more freedom.|`|SOjMYsVnaa	to protect u?|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	shes a little to protected..|`|ZSDEFSRBaa	ya i think she is a lil too protective|`|XadcGNGnaa	You have to remember that you mum carried you inside her and brought you up. She won't want to let go of the little girl that you used to be. Maybe you ought to talk to her about going to bed a bit later and the boyfriend thing but your mum won't want to let you go. And if your 13, you can't do what you want when you want, that's the wrong attitude tbh.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You are only 13!|`|DD8bQxaYaa	try hitting her.|`|3r3xWRwPaa	Im not being mean, but you sound like youre a young and hormonal teenager, nowhere near a woman.

BIG TEENAGE MISTAKE: That the world revolves around you and only you.|`|yLUqNgqsaa	First of all, 13 years old is not a grown-up woman. Teens still need supervision and guidance. But if you really think she's controlling a little too much, sit down with her and discuss what you think. Try to give her reasons to let you have more freedoms instead of just demanding them or screaming at her, that will just make her more determined. Hope this helped ;)|`|lmG4qKDyaa	ohkay, so i was in a similar situation.  you just have to sit down and talk to her about it.  she is just trying to protect you and do what is best fer you, but she is going a little bit over the top.  i`m 16 now and my mom is still protective of me.  dont lie to her and tell her the truth, and get her to trust you alot and maybe that`ll help.
VWvcSOwGaa	just give it time - it doesn't sound like you've known each other very long yet. she wants to get to know you better before going out, don't keep bugging her about it though, otherwise she'll think you're desperate (and girls don't want to go out with guys they feel sorry for) she knows you're interested already and will go out with you when she's ready =)|`|61ekaZLaaa	take time to build up your friendship with her before asking her out again, get to know her, spend as much time as you can with her, she will realise that you are making an effort to be with her. And find out if you really love her, or if she loves you. And just take it from there  All the best.

You need to be the person you are and don't let anyone change you. But you can't stay alone always. Find a friend or two to have fun once in a while.

W1MgefrWaa	Lust leads to love.  The physical attraction that the two strangers felt, will cause a guy to fall in love with u someday.  The thing is, the love will lead to self control, that will keep him from acting that way with anyone else.  Love is the best high there is. Don't give up on it.|`|ed5269fe07c3cf54be9273e05df681f7aa	My sister met this guy at work and they hadn't really even said more than passing hellos but she would come home and talk about him and be like "I think he likes me but I don't know why he hasn't done anything yet."  I told her if he or she finally got the nerve to talk to each other that she'd probably end up marrying him.  He did end up asking her out and they got married last year.  They're really great for each other and I'm really happy for them.  Don't lose hope; it's possible for people to have good relationships.  Now if only I can get one myself. LOL.
vjvx4k9Uaa	Ya she'll think it's sweet   add a funny birthday card/note to show that you're just friends  I mean I'D love flowers ANY day  don't make them pink or red  happy colors like yellow, white, purple etc.  SOunds sweet|`|4aa5ec2b493db915bb99fb24d191aa9baa	Of course, girls always like to get flowers, they don't even need to cost much, we just love to get them !!!!, Flowers are never wrong|`|KZfYzhZRaa	i think that would be really sweet|`|3KD1wCs5aa	It's a great idea!  You could go with something kind of tropically and fun instead of the normal roses.    Something along the same lines that would be a little more permanent would be potted flowers.  There are hibiscus' or daisies and it's something she could put in her room or desk!  You would be amazed how much flowers will brighten a room :)    http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...  or  http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvie...    are cute examples!|`|tEhB0J6caa	Nah get her some flowers! everyone loves a gift. or maybe a gift certificate to a restaurant or the movies would be more appropriate.|`|DJ2yBWjvaa	Well of course!!  every girl likes flowers even if they arent from a bf and just a friend.  so yeah y not!!|`|KAp8tSN9aa	It depends what kind of close friend you are! If you are a close friend who wishes she would be a girlfriend, flowers are good! You could do roses or lilies! If you are strictly just "friends" and don't wish to be more than that, I would stick with some carnations or stay away from flowers. Me being a girl, if a close guy friend gave me flowers for my birthday, I may take it that he's interested in me more than a friend. Good gifts from a guy friend who really just wants to be a friend would be like movie tickets, go out and eat or favorite store gift cards!!! Hope this helps!|`|7YWaao6Raa	flowers might mean u like her..  if u like her..and want her..go for it!  but if ur just friends and planning on staying that  then get her something..less romantic  :D|`|UspK4SQBaa	I'm sure she'll love anything you give her, but since she's a close friend, you would know better than we what she would like.

sknTCvnzaa	Please ... forget selling things, forget wishing wells and dollar dances.  If you cannot afford a honeymoon if you have a wedding please cancel the reception and get married in a way you can afford.    All of the above ideas are just as tacky as selling tickets to your reception.  Begging money at a wedding is classless in and considered very bad taste in most all cultures.      Just don't embarrass yourselves in that way.  If people want to buy you a toaster or help fund your honeymoon they know where their checkbook is with no begging on your part.  Just don't.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I don't want to say it but i think it is a horrible idea.  Have a dollar dance or garter auction if you need to raise $|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can't be serious. You actually expect your guests to pay for your honeymoon and other expenses? Why not just charge admission at the door? Your guests are not obligated to pay for your expensive dreams. If you can't afford a lavish honeymoon, you either wait until you can or scale back to what you can afford out of your own pocket.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	I think you'll get more money from the dollar dance than that.     If you were doing it as a wedding favor that's fine, but honeymoon fund? Why don't you rent an ATM and place it next to the Wishing Well?|`|AA11104372	That is a hideous idea.  I hate money grubbing at weddings.  Dollar dances, wishing wells, etc.  It's all the same.  If you want to give the CDs as favors, that's great, but DO NOT accept donations.  People will spend money money to attend your wedding, and most likely give you a wedding gift, and possibly a shower gift.  Please don't try to hit them up for more.  If you are having trouble covering the cost of the wedding, scale back.|`|MLFBsZnUaa	That kinda seems rude, honestly. Dollar dances are very fun and can be very profitable. My brother n sis in law did dollar dances and ended up with like $300 extra for their honeymoon. Another cute thing they did was my sis in law's brother "kidnapped" her so to say n locked her in his truck for fun then made my brother run back into the hall saying he needed everyones help...everyone had to donate $1 so he could get his new bride back. Everyone thought it was very fun n very cute...tho most people ended up giving more than a dollar...but that has to be their own decision. Having your friends n family come up with n do stuff like that is a lot more tasteful than asking for it yourselves.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	Asking for money, whether it be for a honeymoon, charity, etc. at a wedding, is ALWAYS in bad taste!  Enough said.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	i think it is a bad idea... i wouldn't buy the cd at your wedding... i wouldn't expect my guests to even bring any extra cash to purchase things.  that's what the wishing well or bird cage is for.... set it up and if people give they do|`|KSsLV2thaa	Forgive me, because I don't mean this to sound rude. In my opinion, that is a bit tacky. I will tell you what I have seen done at a wedding I attended. There was a bird cage with a photo of the honeymoon destination next to it. Someone put some cash in it to start things off so that people would know what it was for. Several guests put cash gifts inside the cage, as well as good wish cards. Good luck, and have a happy marriage!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	That will make you sound and seem really greedy for money, do a dollar dance, or a fun way to do it without saying they need to pay for anything is to have a money tree and before everyone gets there tie a dollar to it so they know what its for, that way they don't feel obligated to give you any money as some people might just give you money instead of a gift.|`|76db084b0636ae593b0b3c0e95cb3838aa	Id be really offended and Im not offended easily, its jut not done to ask for money when people have probably already spent money coming to the wedding.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	It's illegal to provide CDs as favors.  And it's tacky to try to hawk them to raise money for yourselves, who taught you manners!|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Not to be rude, but this is an absolutely horrible idea. It is the height of tackiness. A wedding/reception is a celebration of a couple's love for one another, not a fundraiser. Guests MAY bring a gift, but are not required to do so.     If you want people to donate to your honeymoon, then go to a destination that allows you to "register" for things at the resort that guests can purchase as wedding gifts: massages, day trips, champagne, etc. Some places also have registries where guests can just donate an amount to be used on the honeymoon. I still think this is tantamount to begging for money, but at least it's not putting up a collection box at the reception like someone needing a kidney transplant at the local convenience store.     I also think dollar dances are ridiculous. People have already traveled to your wedding, hotels, showers, gifts, etc. and now here you are hitting them up for cash.

5Wr9Mlwoaa	This entire subject is deeply sickening.    Just accept the facts.    All women today, women in the USA society per se, through media, essentially are brainwashed that any man that is unattractive is garbage.    Oh and the one lady that said she was shallow in her twenties but now has "reformed". What a freaking joke that is.    If any woman came up to me today and wanted to be "friendly", I'd just as soon go tell them to piss off.    Where the hell were you at when I needed you most, when I sickeningly alone!    I'm not a mean person, this is a troubling subject like I said. I now the truth. Rest of you are ffffen blind.    Oh and DON'T get me started on the so called Christian lady being shallow. You don't want to know what I think about modern day "Christians".|`|0ylm04PWaa	We all do things to help our appearance, well most of us. I see nothing wrong with that. I would never say a young guy is an old man because of having no hair. I love hair on guys, but I'd rather run fingers over a bare scalp than through a toupee.     Professor, hypothetically speaking if I came up to you to talk, you would just flip your chin up and look the other way? That's not exactly convincing that you have an amicable personality. In fact, if you told me to piss off I'd probably show the bird in your face lol|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	Yes, as much as a woman has to accommodate a man.|`|OtuqLvJwaa	Women change their appearance for men, so why not?      I mean, there's a big difference between having to change your entire look to please a girl, and just taking basic steps to "groom" your appearance.  These basic things, like hairstyle, shaving, at least looking in the mirror when you get dressed, going to the gym every once and awhile, wearing a nice pair of shoes when you go out, and...um.... tidying up down there are not so much things just to please women, but can overall improve your self esteem in many parts of your life.|`|uXdx9vuBaa	i have to say that as a woman, i was very shallow indeed when i was in my twenties.  I wanted a good looking guy and would of never dated a guy who was balding or didnt have it going on.  I also looked at his physique and income.  Young women think this way b/c they want to get married one day and have kids. So...its like the animal kingdom..you try to find a partner who has it all and will take care of your children.  Subconsiously.  But as you get older, Im now almost 42, ive changed alot.  Im no longer this way.  I appreciate a man now for his sense of integrity and kindness.  Looks are still important to me but i dont care so much if he's balding or isnt fit like he used to be. Im more into how he treats me and that he is stable with himself and financially.  That is because i have a good career too and dont want to be with someone below me in that sense.      So young girls/women are very shallow b/c of the inexperience and inablity to appreciate the small things that are often looked over due to raging hormones.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	Everybody likes beautiful. Ask yourself this. Do you like hot women with a pretty face and hot body? People might say they don't care about the looks. But if you are given the choice of being with a beautiful and fit woman, or a fat ugly unmaintained woman, I'm sure the choice is universal. We're all shallow on what we see. But a friend once told me, there are no ugly people. There are only LAZY people. Too lazy to take care of their appearance. So don't worry if you're going bald. Bald can be sexy too with the right accessories. There are always ways to work with what you have. I'm not saying looks are everything. But it is a part of the package.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	A lot of women are shallow about men's appearance, and I feel that's sad. Appearance is such a minor part of a relationship. If girls would concentrate harder on what a man is inside, there would be less separations and divorce. I don't care who you are, beauty is only skin deep and it will fade in time. So..men, I hope you'll concentrate more on who you are inside and not what you look like.|`|4POGapREaa	"modern females"?  Are you serious?  Would you be happy with a girl that was fat, didn't wear any makeup, walked around in sweatpants all day, couldn't be bothered to shave, and had a nasty looking bush down there?  Having pride in yourself relates to all aspects of your life, your motivation & your ambition, not just the physical issue.  If you just want to be a dumpy slob & be accepted for that, then good luck!  I wouldn't date you.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Don't we want them to look good? Why is it shallow to be attracted to beauty? Is it less shallow to be attracted to his income or bank account? Why would a sense of humor be less shallow than great looks?    It is true though for women that looks aren't as important. Who you are and how you act are more likely deal breakers than looks. Confidence is a much more important trait to display than a good head of hair, but the hair doesn't hurt.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I'm an older woman who can be really shallow about a man's appearance.  AND, I find this question coming from a man absolutely, breathtakingly hilarious.      But to answer:  Beauty is still only skin deep, and when it comes to a man, confidence is to the bone.  I prefer thin men with full heads of hair.  My ex husband was bald and had a beer gut.  I didn't divorce him over the bald and beer gut, but the beer had a lot to do with it.    Just have accomplishments you're proud of, be a man of integrity and carry yourself well and you'll find the one for you (maybe not a harem and if you're looking for that, you deserve what you get lol).|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Actually, physical appearance will never ever add much to a long-term relationship.      Focusing on appearance instead of who a person actually 'is' is idiotic as is focusing on that instead of developing as a person yourself.
ZKo2M8qOaa	Well, sorry to say that it just sounds like your typical guy to me. Is there any ulterior motive you can think of as to him speaking about both of you with the other? Most guys are able and willing to date multiple girls unfortunately. I don't understand why he would bring you up to her and vice versa unless he is getting a kick out of making you two jealous which in turn would make him feel special. Sounds like he has some psychological issues that need to be addressed. Good luck with him. Me personally though, I would look for someone else who is capable of treating you with respect and dignity. No one deserves to be with someone like the guy you described.

AjFA8qIxaa	If something makes you feel bad you wont do it again, right? So she keeps making you feel bad, then why do you let her? You don't need "friends" like that. Stop hanging out with her, she's not good for you. I don't know if she's just jealous, plain mean or maybe even actually believes shes looking out for you but either way she doesnt seem to care how it makes you feel. So go and cut your losses. If she asks , yeah, go ahead and tell her why you wont be hanging out with her anymore but no matter what she says,stick with it.|`|TZeKta4haa	no she is not your friend she is jelous of you and wants to bring you down to make her feel like she is better. you should not tell her that your leveing her just do not talk to her|`|ZlWhnobDaa	she isnt your friend. a good friend wouldnt make you feel like that|`|6zzte15caa	Tell her shes acting in a very dislikeable manner.

Ask her if she loves you then why she is saying things that hurts you deeply. Most people I know who do that to friend tend no to be happy with themselves. I think something inside of her is missing, that's why she is confused. have a serious discussion with her and if she doesn't listen or think she has not done anything wrong then leave her. you wouldn't regret it.|`|AA11706291	She doesn't sound like much of a friend, you could try telling her that she has got it wrong and that you aren't flirting and she shouldn't be saying those things in front of people as it makes you look like someone you aren't.    If she denies doing anything wrong and carries on doing it then maybe you should distance youself and have little or nothing to do with her.|`|vOb9BMmWaa	you should call 724 654 7109 he will tell you his name is gavin he helped me with a alot of things|`|GSTcqG4Raa	Okay we all friends like this in our life time.

Hope you Feel Better .    =P|`|ngbFVluiaa	in my experience women friendships with other women are very complex.  women are seemingly not very competitive when it comes to sports or games, but when it comes to social status and guys they are very competitive.  i would think that if she is trying to undermine you then she is either jealous of you, or making fun of you to try and raise her own social status.  or finally, if she is trying to eliminate you as competition in front of guys she likes.  either way, it is simplistic to say that displaying this behaviour means she is not your friend - it just means she has some nasty areas to her character - like everyone really.  i would suggest she isnt a friend that you should trust a lot though.|`|MpHpidScaa	Dear buddy. Let me tell you that no relation is 100% perfect. it is just like a new plant, you will have to give all your attention and care, sometimes even after doing all this, the plant may die, then you should move on thinking that this too shall pass...thats life!  Coming back to your problem, I would suggest that you openly tell her that you feel hurt when she makes negative remarks about you in front of others. Listen to what she has to say. You can judge from the answer that she gives. If she really likes you, then she would not repeat the same mistake again. Give her one more chance, if it works, good for both of you, and if not, then ignore her. Time will heal everything. Wish you all the best, there are many new friends around the world dear, just open your eyes and look around.|`|78aBwPooaa	I had a friend like that once. Anyway a friend is someone who you can trust, feel comfortable with and basically can have a laugh with. If she makes you feel sad then shes not worth being friends with! Talk to her but just let her go gradually. Or just tell her how you feel about how she has been treating you. Don't get too worried about this! If she really wants to be friends with you, she would obviously treat you with a bit more respect. Actions speak louder than words. If she says she loves you and actually treats you with love then, well its completely up to you.   Hope I helped!  :]|`|nTRIyLS3aa	You guys were good friends in highschool but some people change for a number of different reasons... You should confront her and ask why she is behaving this way and if she gives you crap then dont waste your time around people who make you feel bad.
EYLSyeajaa	looks like youre the one whos going to have to make a move.     ask him to study with you, its not a date. youre friends. && it might make him feel more comfortable with you. as you said he only greets you when youre alone. id say stage 5 shy guy.    i think, with what you said, hes interested. give him time. take a risk. do you think hes worth it ? asking him out would mean hes a decent enough guy to deal with the rejection. but he might say yes..    && as for the very odd slow walking.. maybe he got hard? && he was too embarassed the 2nd time.. hes a guy. sry to sound rude. ive got too many guyfriends! haha    best of luck !|`|V2IGDBHIaa	I think its really cute the thing you two have going on here. I would say that this guy likes you. If you think he is more shy than you and you want to try it out, you are probably going to have to be the one who asks him or give him some signal or chance to ask you. I think he likes you. Probably nervous and scared that you won't like him staring at you or that you would get scared of him. Go for it if you like him :)|`|0ec3ff8a6cac8b59459899dbb6e9852caa	i say you ask him out. Maybe he is just really shy and does;t know how to ask you out. YOu should be the bigger person and ask him you never want to be stuck with the question what if I asked him out at the end?|`|JmtLuueHaa	Who knows, not all guys are the same. Ask him directly. Lol, seriously, since I'm sure he likes you. The best way to do it is to just ask him, cause he won't really have a choice but to answer. Make sure you're not with a lot of people though.|`|TMhVClBgaa	you need to get the guy to tell you how he feels or how you feel.|`|Hs19BCy9aa	I think he doesn't talk to you with your friends because hes scared of being judged by them and I think he likes you if I were you I would talk to his friends.|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	take a chance ask him out what's the worst that can happen
CEKAqtB1aa	Not really wouldnt they make a move if they liked you by now?|`|ouIZdXdaaa	just because you like someone doesn't mean they are going to like you too.|`|AA11899313	The answer depends upon your mentality.    If this person were not your sort = just ''Not fanciable'' to you, then could you?    As long as he is not throwing rocks at your head, trying to push you down stairs, or shouting obscenities at you and calling you LOUDLY aggressive names, then my guess is that he doest NOT dislike you.     As to whether could possibly fancy you!      As a guy, there are a whole heap of female celebrities ~ actresses, singers etc who may be classed as 'Attractive', but ~ l really could not feel attracted to even if the individual were to announce she found me attractive.    Sorry, but things don't always work out how you think they might or ought to.    Life is like that.  Sash.|`|kiJUCYMcaa	Well, i am a girl but i hope so....well i have this crush on a boy and i hope he likes me back|`|cmFU81rQaa	Sometimes, yes.  Usually what happens is if they like you you think about them more.  And that sometimes leads to you liking them back.  Sometimes not so much, but sometimes yes.|`|bKzuw0IMaa	Well it depends. The one who likes you might be pretty so you like her for her physical appearance, sometimes for personality. But usually you can like them cos you like the attention and the idea that someone likes you and so you become more attached to that kind of emotion|`|ssozOulnaa	no i dont
bvwYVGJOaa	I'd try and call up the number anonymously and check who it is, if he/she is quiest and dont say nothing then i'd ignore it, if it carries on like that then i'd call the police.    you dont if some psycho is doing that or not|`|7THgBSvfaa	Umm.. That is weird.. Maybe it was the wrong number..
EZKe92TTaa	Please tell your parents to help you. I'm not kidding. Never mind that you're not 18 but she is 13, and she might decide to get you in a heap of trouble if you don't give her what she wants. Your parents need to know her intentions. Maybe they can speak to her parents. Stay away from her, don't be alone with her, and talk to someone about it. This girl sounds like trouble to me.|`|BqxYa9tEaa	Just don't do it.    It sounds immoral to do it with a 13yr old when you are 17.    But then again you aren't even an adult and you are both teenagers, BUT it sounds like a bad situation. I'd understand if she was 15 or 16, but 13......she's pretty bold to even ask you that.|`|VZOisk2saa	o wow maybe you should tell your parents and let them handle it  really she is 13 does she really even know what sex is all about  your right to have the fear  of getting yourself in trouble  that could make alot of trouble  really be big trouble once you turn 18   ~PD|`|VLj0lb3jaa	Well if you tell her parents they might assue that you're trying to turn it around and make it see as though she wants you when you really want her or some crazy thing like that.  Parents are quick to jump to denial.    And all she has to say is that you were the one coming on to her and everyone will take her word over your's, as sad as that is.    I would ignore it and if it still continues talk to your parents about it and maybe they'll stop her from coming around or something.    I hope that helps.
3203c9731cb9bf893f22dac9386a7f85aa	1)Tell her she is beautiful   2)Leave her voice messages to wake up to.   3)Write her notes or call her just to say hi   4)Make her laugh (you should know the ways)   5)Every guy should give their girl 3 things: a stuffed animal (shell hug it every time she goes to sleep), jewelry (shell treasure it forever), and one of her t-shirts (shell most likely wear it to bed) or sweatshirts sprayed with her cologne!! and flowers or something occasionally.     6)If your listening to music, let her listen too.   7)Always call her when you say you will, it may not seem like it, but it does hurt her and makes her think you dont care so call even if you can only talk for a minute. Girls dont necessarily have to have hour long conversations every night but its nice for us to hear your voice even for a quick hello.   8)Give her wat she wants   9)Recognize the small things  they usually mean the most.   10)Hang out with her whenever you are free and u should be free to hang wit your girl friend all the time   11)If you care about her, then TELL HER|`|y9RKDwvdaa	i like the one about buying her food...if a guy bought me food he'd have my heart instantly. =)|`|bYFS7xBCaa	bring the calendar and see all the upcoming major dates,and prepare a surprise at each.     something she doesn't expect at all.

It doesn't really matter, because you will find the right person someday, just don;t rush into it. Good luck.
78ed5d71dd73eb5414eaaf0f5e5cb89aaa	I have noticed this so many times on Y/A. Someone posts a question about dating a separated person and they get lots of answers saying ' they are still married, keep out of it' etc. The general advice is don't go near anyone until the ink is dry on the divorce papers. So what if you ex is deliberately being difficult and dragging their feet on the divorce. Are you realistically supposed to wait forever? You have to judge the situation for yourself. If you know with 100% that your marriage(or your partners marriage) is over then I don't see why you should be lonely just to please people around you who may not approve.|`|YyMUz1naaa	I *JUST* posted a question relating to a situation that I'm in dating a separated man. *sigh*, I completely expect to be ripped apart for it. :/|`|XxPhbwNfaa	Because of the whole "until death do us part" vow.  Marriage is still looked upon as whole, as an institution, and divorce is still looked upon as a cop out.  My mom divorced in the 1960s, and we as a family were all looked upon as outcasts for many years.  When she dated, she was called a loose lady, even after the divorce.    Things have changed some, but the stigma still remains.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Some people will look at it through the eyes of 'religious tenet", and some will just be looking at the situation from a practical perspective.  From a practical point of view...unless you've been separated for YEARS...you haven't given yourself enough time to untangle yourself from the emotional/financial/legal ties of the marriage.  Too much can happen before the ink is dry on the paperwork.  And from a religious point of view...you still ARE married in the eyes of the church.|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	Its not over until its over!

Not due to possibly reconciliation, due to unresolved issues relating to the divorce and causes of it.    I dated too soon, so my opinion is based on my own experience.  It's a very vulnerable place to be...    I was in Virginia which required a year wait due to our child.  About 7 months into the year wait, he hired an attorney to have our Separation Agreement set aside (and he wasn't keeping it anyway lol).  This caused another delay of over a year--time elapsed from separation to divorce?  Nearly 2 years.  I get what you're saying.    It's a very shaky foundation if you plan to marry this man.|`|tkctDsi3aa	well i know its over she had me arrested|`|eWtqPufZaa	When my sister was going through her divorce our whole family was against her dating because she was heart broken still and we felt she was being taken advantage of. How can you feel and see clearly during that time is the question? (I wouldn't know ha vent been there myself, but it's the big question we have) until the dust settles and you have time to sort it all out, how can you make the right choices? I think it's also fair to you and whoever you date, that you be free and clear of all the prior drama and issues. Have a clean fresh start with a huge smile on your face!!    No judgment passing... We only raised cane because we care about her. (she was only 21 at the time also) Not because we wanted a hobby of judging people like a lot of people actually do...just for the sake of being mean! good luck to you :)|`|44mmJ14Caa	ITS NOT THE NEWS FAULT HE JUST KINDA GOT PUT IN THE MIDDLE...MY HUSBAND AND I SEPARATED AND ANOTHER GIRL WAS STAYING WITH HIM AND IT CRUSHED ME I MEAN IF YOUR MARRIED UR MARRIED U CAN BE SINGLE AND UR NOT TILL U GET A DIVORCE...ITS STILL ADULTERY|`|21TogLbJaa	as long as there is no kids to get hurt go for it|`|AA10941788	Because even though your separated you still married in God's eyes|`|AA10392041	Because it is what it is.

KrJghHZIaa	The amount of stress your under does sound reasonable. You need to explain to your husband about your problems, if he loves you he'll stand by you no matter what. As for your daughter, you have to talk to her about her choices, without forcing her to do what you want. As for the jobs, if your pregnant it may be hard to find work as it won't be long before you need maturnity leave, so focous on looking after your family and working out the problems at home.|`|w29tsXLUaa	It sounds to me that you care 'too' much for others and not enough for yourself.  Anyone can drop a baby. She could have been slow at reading and writing anyway. She is young and you may be surprised later one when she starts understanding things better. All children are different in the way they learn, even a Quad.  A 17 year old can be advised so far, then they do exactly what they want. You have to tell your husband about the 17 year old being pregnant though.    You chose to become a surrogate for your sister in law. I hope all goes well with that. That is indeed a gift of the highest rank.    Forget going back to work for the moment. You push yourself too hard.    You are not a terrible parent and useless wife. You are wonderful. Take care of yourself.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	You need therapy and you are trying to do too much and you are not going back to work with all of this stress|`|ZB524v05aa	Wait:  you have a 17 year old who is pregnant, a 4 year old with a disability, and you are now pregnant? What is your reasoning for wanting to go back to work?  You already feel as if you are ignoring your husband and children and now you want to go back to work also?     i'm not saying you are a bad wife or mother, but if its not for financial reasons that you are going back to work, then yeah, I do think you need to spend a little more time focusing on your family.|`|riGWQUA9aa	You really need to talk to some one!!  So your daughter is pregnant! You got to tell your husband.  As for your four year old, 4 year olds are just learning to read and write, some children develop their skills in time. Ok you dropped her when she was two, Is the medical experts telling you its your fault?  Not alot of people could do what you are doing, becoming a surrogate for your brother.  As for the job......you need to do something as it seems to me you are taking all your families concerns on on your own.  I think once you have your own head sorted out everything else will do so too.  good luck|`|wxZxLVGkaa	-your daughter being pregnant was a decision and a risk she took and made. never stop being a mother, guide and help her when she needs it and its understandable the pain and the confusion she'll go through you don't want her to have to go through but it'll be necessary for her to do to deal with any future situations.  But never forget to love and be there regardless!    -with your 4 yr old, understand things happen, as strange as some may seem they happen for a reason but same with your daughter love and help her unconditionally it may a little more time and patience and it will get frustrating but remember its all to better her and yourself!    -being a surrogate, that's when the helping should turn into a little more thinking, you wanted to help them in whatever situation they were in where they weren't able to have children but at the same time was that something you were ready to take on? Would you say you put yourself aside for the wants of others?     -and going back to work, with everything going on do you really feel you would be able to work at your best? is it financial reasons why you want to go back to work? is it boredom? if so spending more time with your kids and taking that special time out for yourself enjoying a hobby may be whats necessary!    *HOPE I CAN HELP!!*|`|BQXg09m9aa	Okay, I will NOT say that you are a terrible parent, and a useless wife, but I WILL say that you are not thinking straight!!    Okay, if you think that it's wrong that you haven't told your husband your daughter is preg, than you should! If there is a reasonable reason for why you haven't then maybe you shouldn't!    If your four year old daughter is struggling to read and write, doesn't point fingers, just try to make it better!    If you feel as though you are a surrogate for your brother and sister in law , then fix what you got yourself into, and whilst,t teach your four year older how to read, and maybe confess to your husband!    Tell your kids about the interview if that's something that's going to bug you THAT much. I don't see the problem.    There are such easy solutions to your problems, just use that brain that God gave you to your best advantage!!
i4cGy4W7aa	Drive fast and take chances.|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	NO  enjoy yourself to the extreme!|`|eLwZ5GD3aa	Nah u shouldn't feel bad about hanging out with her ex since she HAS a boyfriend already if she says anything about it she's just selfiss and should be happy for you
JX0I6x1paa	I did my own wedding stationery and there was no way I was going to spoil it by handwriting my envelopes (my handwriting is terrible too).  It looked professional and it all tied in.  I didn't get one complaint.  In fact many people told me what a great job I'd done.    Go ahead and print your envelopes.  There's no reason not to.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You are going to have some sticklers tell you that wedding invitations should always be hand-addressed.    As a wedding guest many times over, I'm going to be honest - no one cares. The first thing I do with the invitation is write the details on my calendar and then throw the envelope away! As long as the invitation makes it to my mailbox, I don't care if you use alphabet stamps.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I'd print um up|`|FVFxE6owaa	The envelope is so the post office knows where to deliver the mail.  If your handwriting is unreadable, print the addresses.  The post office needs to be able to read it.  It's not about aesthetics.
t0MiDBMEaa	The fact that you have to ask this question should be your answer.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes Its quite normal for this to happen. I suggest you do your best to find yourself a girl friend or use other distractions  and don't act on your feelings.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Don't avoid it! DO HER!!! lol    It may be taboo, but you're not blood related.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	o damn dude  u are lucky  but yea.. 1st of all.. she to old for u  look some other girl that is better than her|`|lQmGDPIoaa	Kill her lol. HAHAHA I dont thinks it wierd shes not related to through genes so I guess its sorta alright.  I dont know how to avoid it though.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	not much as boys your age are growing and will admire any female that pays attention to them or is around them   It's a faze and will pass when you become more able to interact with girls your own age|`|XR2BCYOSaa	Yeah its wrong, sick.  and find someone your own age who isn't a relative.  God kid you're gross.|`|oubC3TCOaa	Move to the South and marry her.|`|eE7Np0n6aa	Don't avoid the feelings, what's the worst that could happen.|`|WXO67wNDaa	well...she's not blood family..so it is normal enough...its not your fault|`|3m8JgWj1aa	being that there is no blood relation it isn't wrong but i little weird. with the age difference there is also the look but don't touch type thing, just don't try to pursue anything and you will be fine, and if you really need to get over it just tell yourself that she is your sister and that should really help|`|b5xJqC5oaa	She isn't technically a part of your immediate family, so there is no need to feel ashamed.  Many famous people have married into their own family.  Even Albert Einstein married his own cousin!    ........|...  ........|..........2 points ........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|eoZJO3J8aa	i think it normal..   at longest you are not blood relative.  is she your step sister like if your parents verly met and got together  or is she your  half sister cuz your dad had a previous relationship or your mother had a relationship and didnt work out?|`|9hSSocD0aa	Theres nothing you can do to help it.  but your going to have to find someone  else your age. Just tell her how you feel  but if you do that shes going to act different  around you. so just think before you say  anything to her.  -XD|`|DlBeFoKcaa	go beat off....then get over her|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	If you are in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, or Tennessee, I am sure you can marry her (with your parents' permission at 15 or without at 18).    Not really.  Run.  Far.  Run.  Fast.|`|kAsfXZzVaa	talk with her and notice some gross or weird things and then u wont feel that way|`|UpvzJGAYaa	It would be kinda wrong if both of your parents have been together for a LONG time. Like 10+ years.    Because I'm your age and my stepbrother is 16 and he's like a real brother too me because our parents have been together since I was 4.    But, since you guys aren't related what so ever, I say it's okay.  It would be kind of weird if you acted on anything though.|`|JxmJg37Iaa	shoot yourself, well not literally obviously, but get your but out and get a girlfriends of your own age thats not related to you in any way shape or form.|`|T9rYxZRgaa	woahh.. haha.    well... yeah, its normal.    you're a guy, she's cute. do the math. :)    but since now she's your stepsister, i would try to stop those feelings from happening.|`|4m5cgyzxaa	its a hard one, its up to u dont think its illegal, but she is older. dont worry ur not geneticaly related so its fine|`|bej0DcS8aa	get yourself a girlfriend and spend more time with your girlfriend and then you wont have time 2 even think about your stepsister anymore!|`|2DRWQxP3aa	Don't act on these feelings. You like her but your related now. If you can't get rid of the feelings mask them.|`|31sPPNpTaa	Is this Yahoo Answers, or the Penthouse forums?  Don't worry, it's normal to be attracted to your step sister.  I'm attracted to your step sister, too.  Best thing to do, though, is to get her drunk.|`|k7XAymUDaa	remember she's family! And fight hard! You may also remember that she would never be with you, not insulting you, but you're too young for her. Try to look for someone more your age.... You must have willpower, I'm afraid there's no other way than using this willpower!|`|fyKydb6Iaa	Your a 15 year old male, just keep telling yourself she is your sister, and don't do things for her just to turn yourself on, you should respect her more.|`|1BlHwhjHaa	Stop being a nasty pervert is my suggestion. God said you're going to hell.|`|KhVyci6kaa	don't even try.  she'll probably think you're a freak and get your parents divorced.|`|wAnK7clsaa	dude if  you like her only for sex then simple idea to have sex with her it to get a nude video nude photoes of her some way and ask her to have sex for the video and after some days start blackmaling her for the photoes.    2nd idea for having sex    get her drugged and after she is out **** her to your  ultimate strenght    3rd idea               when you are alone with her ask her to have sex with you  if she refuses then force her to have it  4th idea         tell her that you will pay some money say 100$ or 400$ for having sex with her        and dude if you want to marry her       then make her to fall in love with you .sit with your parenta and her them that you want to marry her when you are 18.  and i dont think she is too big for you|`|DqJeSFWWaa	dont worry yo its normal   unless yalls parents been together for a long time
fhzHiBMyaa	Hm, excuses such as "I'm busy" doesn't cut it. If this has been happening maybe for more than 2 weeks, then hate to say it, but she is ignoring you. It was a nice thing for her to ask if you were ok. And I applaud you for telling her like it is "Hell no" good for you! No, in my opinion, she isn't a true friend. Usually my friends and I hate the same people. Like why would she be friends with your enemies. Nope, hate to break it to you, but I would consider making more friends, cause this girl, isn't worth it.|`|TTjzHPcgaa	NO way is she your best friend.  best friends should always be together and always talking and hanging out and if she can't even bother to do that she doesn't deserve being called a "bff"  sorry sweety she's not.|`|EhQyJE14aa	No.    Anyone who's mean doesn't deserve to be anyone's BFF.    Tell her.
weaFl9mVaa	your fine... if he kissed you back then he is ok with your crush. However, believe and respect the fact that he says he is gay. To tell someone that they are gay is prob one of the hardest things anyone gay will ever do in their life. Be supportive. His parents and family may want to disown him, or worse "fix" him. He's lucky to have a friend like you.|`|8V39PymEaa	no|`|KFJJzLmTaa	no that isnt wrong. he was probably joking around. if u dont think so then just ask him. "are u really gay??" if he kisses u back that proves he's not gay.|`|9z9BW10daa	No, it's not wrong.  Some guys are really flambouyant and obvious, but with others, you would never know.  He could be bi-sexual, maybe?  Or he may just be confused.  I can't say for sure; I'm not him.  But if I were you, I would just sit down and just talk about it with him.  That's the easiest way in my opinion.    Good luck!|`|HcBp3cFDaa	i don't think it's wrong.  i think its kinda weird.  was it like a kiss on the cheek?  or on lips.  if it was on the cheek- it's just friendly  on the lips- thenn uhh idk?  i think it sounds like he is bi.  you should talk to him about that cus that is not normal.|`|dp2oNqa0aa	no i dont think it was wrong you cant control what your heart wants.but i dont know how he took it maybe since he's gay he took it in a friendly way or maybe he's bi and took it as a more than a friend thing. does he know that you like him?? well if he doesnt you should tell him .|`|ibR6jJgHaa	w..t..f    are u sure he isn't bi?|`|TB9lKVj1aa	maybe he had some feelings for you and i still think he does. just ask him if he likes you or hes gay and say u dont want this 2 affect ur friendship :]]|`|wmfJJLiDaa	two of my friends are gay, and just like you, i had developed a crush on both of them. you just have to realize that its his decision and move on. try to be as supportive as possible!!
OQsj0Am3aa	You should have lied and said you found it in the garden !    Then asked what it was for.|`|upk2Hzeeaa	Your mom and uncle are right.  Condoms aren't fail safe and you're too young to be having sex anyway.  Your mom must be a crappy parent anyway that she doesn't know you well enough that this all happened in the first place but that's another matter.
HOl6N45iaa	People only do that if 1-their lonely 2- if their desperate 3-they just want a boyfriend Or 4-they realize they actually do like him|`|LboE9e4paa	i think its just that it makes u feel really nice about yourself for a while. and maybe right when they tell u then u begin to like them a little. i think thats what happens to me soemtimes, but it never turns into a huge crush, just for lilke a couple days and ten its over. oddd|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	because just knowing tht someome WANTS YOU and LIKES YOU makes u feel good about ur self...even if sometimes u dont like them in that way|`|Wm6LdJeRaa	to me that kinda happens they tell me they like you and you get confidence that someone likes u for u and you kinda like them 2|`|65879eecb0be58b339997b05c0d5c69faa	Many people would begin to look at them more favorably because the person's ego responds to those who like them.|`|KvKaMhXvaa	I think you are flattered by them telling you that they like you.  I don't think that feeling is going to last very long.  Nothing says you can't go out and get to know this person a little better to see how you really feel.|`|uOwkl5KWaa	1st u should start by stopping not liking them, and 2nd start lookin 4 the good things in them. I think u'll eventually like them.|`|Dd5YdYFFaa	It depends on what type of person you are. If your the type that hasn't been in a relationship in a while, then you most likely will feel that way, mostly because you have the security of knowing that someone cares about you. But that's not necessarily true for all people.|`|F8sYQsB5aa	idk|`|diiHN0KGaa	I hate that. That happens because maybe you want a bf/gf. Or you just didnt really know that you did care about them
JX0I6x1paa	Your wife is right.  What makes you think you are so special they are still hung up over you?  They've moved on.  It's time you did too.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Your wife is naive.  Why on earth would you still be friends with these people?  Most couples never get to the point of "friendship" no matter what you say during the breakup.  Most of the time one of the parties is still thinking they need to prove we are happier than you are.      You rejected both of these people (in the first paragraph you said you rejected her but in the second she rejected you) so they both feel YOU think you are superior.  To counter act that they have to prove they are.  Either way this is never going to be a friendship.  Tell your wife to let it go and make real friends.  She is being optimistically naive.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	You sound like a nut. Your wife sounds rational. Do you actually think these people have invited you to visit solely for the purpose of getting one over on you? Maybe they're just a happy couple who wants to get together with old friends. Maybe that's how they remember you. Maybe they're so happy together they don't even recall that they wanted to go out with either of you. Get a grip.
dalNxu8zaa	not at all...|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Not a bit of it! Just saying hi or hello is being friendly.|`|BYHRjUa6aa	i don't think so. just be nice and polite. go ahead and make your move!      sincerly,    a girl|`|9N6sW6KAaa	nope but try saying hey whats up or soemthing cause then when you say hi she says hi then you get stuck but hey whats up then she smiles and you have your convo right there hopefully everything goes well for you|`|Y77wbUZxaa	well not really....if you like her then try to start a conversation with her..that way you guys can get to now each other..|`|tO8ey3o8aa	no go for it!!  but make sure that shes actually smiling at u and not the person behind u lol|`|nyXkOZddaa	lol no, not at all just tell her how you feel and i'm certain she likes you back|`|AAQrhKg6aa	no its not creepy but try to act more cool about it .. walk by and just say hey whats up acting casual and confident is key|`|2QS8j9aOaa	No, its smart because you will never become anything to this girl if you don't put action into your situation. Walk over, say Hi and then talk to her and have lunch with her. A month later your are boyfriends if you play it smart and put action into that smiling back to the girl you like.|`|kPwHlu45aa	No, its not creepy at all...girls like that!|`|toKpvuGSaa	Ofcourse not your just being friendly and trying to start convo you'll never get anywhere by just smiling at each other|`|G6letrTBaa	well...i'm a girl and i'd be sort of embarrassed if a guy did that...    if she's with her friends it might be kind of embarrassing. so try to talk to her when she's not with a big group of people
kG6VWsGvaa	No, we like flimsy little boys.|`|Tf19RETiaa	yeaa|`|7yrdcqY1aa	i like a lil muscle however i don't like the huge muscle guys and i hate the buff but chubby guys i like em' tone and a lil bulge.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	Some, but not HUGE ones, that's just inhuman|`|5A7RmIH6aa	money is better than muscles..|`|Vg0diLbNaa	Yes.  But not like, crazy bodybuilder muscles.|`|KXYqCgWxaa	yeah but not like a lot a little is good enough|`|XXlAs7QCaa	yeah!
urJIlSBQaa	NO i wouldnt dump him for that.  I'd let him massage my feet every nite!  =D|`|Am0xRpEjaa	you shouldnt dump him cause of that thats mean he obviously trusts you and likes you enough to tell you this|`|zGi9Wag3aa	A foot fetish is never harmless. it's a gateway fetish. next thing you know he's having sex with you in a fursuit.|`|SvIBu4yRaa	i think its cute. just dont be all gross about it. lol girls dont like feet so whatever you do try and make it sexy|`|PdNJCcK3aa	Kissing your toes is ok.. but going as far as licking them.. ok now that's a little weird|`|7lJpHeYSaa	In all honesty I'd would have no problem with it, but most girls would think it was erm.. unconventional and weird.
mKIA6V4Saa	Dance a jig
47b20e60745f3c0a32438dc5f1f733c5aa	Casual, it doesn't have to be a big deal, but something she wants to hear from you. Approach her when there is no one around and ask her "guess who asked me out today?" If she wouldn't object to it then this should help make her exited for you. Best of luck.
NkYQXP8Oaa	Just be natural, smile and say hello.  You'll be OK:)|`|QEUSXBgaaa	uhhh.....no. :/  you're too young to be goign through puberty.    and you're just shy, thats all.  try to be more outgoing :]|`|DbMCubDuaa	Think about how you would talk to your friends or just guys in general. Talk about about interests both of you share.    Good Luck!|`|AA11515948	Just nerves - you'll grow out of it :)|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	breathe and tell yourself that they are human beings and when you feel confident, you look even better.  good luck hun!|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	You're probably going through puberty|`|0OSeBeLaaa	its ok- just remember that girls are just like you, but have different bodies to you!!!!    now go and get them!!!|`|Tp4R14rlaa	nope guys usually start puberty at 11. maybe ur early....|`|CNIplNpjaa	Yeah, it's just puberty. You're just getting nervous. But once your balls drop, you'll have no trouble talking to girls at all.|`|gG5VyXOFaa	its all in ur head  itll go away eventually  :)|`|2F4vkfnxaa	you are supposed to be 13 to be on Y!A .|`|ExftbSP7aa	haha aww your so cute.  it's usually just because your nervous !  just relax, buddy.  you'll grow used to it.  :]|`|n06pIHFhaa	You're the 'nervous around girls' type?  Hey I thought those guys were pretty cute,  Lots of Luffs|`|nf45Bxpkaa	it just means your starting to see beauty in woman now.... your hormones are starting to kick in. puberty has obviously started early in you (mentally anyways)|`|JjJj69xiaa	Just be yourself, chill, and and make conversation. Don't stress it too much. You're only ten dude.|`|2k2bnvJ4aa	aw i say thats cute! its normal. im a girl and it happened to me. girls think its cute actually! =)  hope this helps buddy|`|shb1309caa	First- you're too young to be on here.  Second- You're too young to be going through puberty.  Third- You shouldn't be worrying about girls at this age.  Fourth- get on with your life, be friends with girls. We're not that scary.|`|Rjx4KwaYaa	ur growing up kiddo.  ur seeing girls into a new light|`|TTxhFymwaa	welll duh  ur too young  and u feel like ur 15 or older but ur not  ur just normally shy i ustu get shy aroun boys but i got over it|`|ub6lxGPIaa	It kind of means that you're nervous... It's kind of natural for most guys...  But you're kind of young, so u will probably grow out of it.    To talk to girls, just act natural, talk to them like they're just one of the guys. U don't have to treat them that much differently! Just compliment them! Just act natural and try not to act stalkish or act fake!|`|yte0BzXKaa	The more the talk to girls the more confidence you will gain and the less nervous you will get.  Talk to them and try and picture in your head that they like you back, even if they don't, this will probably make you relax around them.    Try and make them laugh, compliment them.  But not all in one, it will look desperate.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	don't worry it doesn't matter if you cant talk to girls i dint get a girlfriend until i was 13 so it will go away and you will be able to talk to girls and get a girlfriend    or maybe you might not be able to talk to girls but guys instead and you might get a boyfriend     you never know|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	The early stirrings of puberty, yes. You have suddenly realise that girls are different.    Here's something to think about - girls experience similar. Really!     When you feel yourself freezing up, take 3 big deep breaths and think 'unfreeze'. Pinch yourself. Remember to smile and say hello.     You'll be fine, pet.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	just be yourself. say hi thats all you have to do.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	you are way to young|`|M3CsxF2jaa	puberty is happening enjoy it|`|faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	hahaha. UM prolly not you are just aware of girls. Haven't you ever seen cute little pics of 3 year olds kissing??     Sry i think you might have to wait a few more years haha.
	You should probably not tell her right now because it will add stress that is unneeded but if the right time comes around then you should tell her that you were hurt since you went so far as to quit your job. You must love her and be real close if you gave up a job.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I would politely and calmly tell her she hurt my feelings. She needs to be aware.
MX1shAbcaa	Plan time in advance to go out oh yeah, and you could study with him.  Good luck ~ William.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	How well do you know him? Has he done this before. If he's taking his studies seriously, then its understandable. So what if other people make more time for fun things? They may not care about their grades as much as your BF.     If this is something he doesn't normally do then definitely sit down and talk with him about whats going on. Tell him you miss him and are jealous of the fact that other couples can still get together, but you two can't.|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	help him study that way he does what he needs to and you get your special time|`|fxnb8STvaa	Hmmm i'm kinda in the same situation  maybe he is just really decicated to his coursework etc so he feels like he wants to put effort into it and then have fun when it's all done.    all you need to do is have a simple chat with him, telling him that you miss him/you two having fun and being toegther and that he should consider having some fun as well as working as it's possible to juggle both. tell him you understand coursework is important, but so are girlfriends!    hopefully, he'll understand :)
jgEvnYNlaa	Charliee's Angel- He digs ya baby!
Q3CmBRKSaa	hi wanda   this person really worries me he shows a very violent and nasty side yes he may be very good with kids but quite often people arnt really what they seem to be on the surface an he seems to be hiding something very major.  And for him to mock your beliefs just goes to show he has no respect for you not everyone has to believe with you or share the same beliefs but they have no need to mock what you believe in im sorry but that was really wrong.    Wanda ppl like him know how to find the vulnerable ones they can see it a mile away sit down an think of exactly what it is about him that you like is it just that you love to watch him play with your son or is it more than that but also think of all the things that you question that dont seem right that just dont add up.  Im sorry wanda but he seems like a pathological liar an he does seem highly dangerous he may have some good points about him but in the long run is it just going to be a life of him coming around to use you for his own selfish needs or could it be somethin that you mutally together get somethin from in other words a healthy relationship.  Just remember we all deserve better than to be treated like a piece of meat we deserve respect loyalty and to be treated the same way we would treat others dont allow anyone to treat you less than that dont let ppl drag you down stay positive remember the good things an focus on them and enjoy life.  Good Luck|`|MhpccWpmaa	My personal opinion? Forget about him.  It seems to me that he is just using you like you said for sex and only comes around when it suits him. Hearing him arguing about seeing women with a woman in his house is a clue that he might be and probably is seeing other women.  At the very least if you don't stop seeing him, stop having sex with him.  Tell him you want to take it slower and don't feel comfortable doing that anymore until there is a committment.  This could result in one of two things: one-you find out he really does like you and is committed because he sticks around or two-you find out that he really is a jerk because he refuses to see you if he can't sleep with you.  Whatever happens and whatever you choose to do I wish you the best of luck and hope I helped|`|upk2Hzeeaa	I'm sorry that was way too long to read but he seems like a shifty guy to me who is trying to hide something from you.

Also tell her that just because you have a new girlfriend it doesn't mean you will spend less time with her and more time with your gf.

Your girlfriend and my girlfriend proves what I've always known. Age and maturity have nothing to do with each other. My girlfriend is young but very mature and responsible (when she needs to be) and I dont experience any of the hardships that you appear to be facing. She does sometimes let the kid in her out but she can control and harness it. She has a sense of when its appropriate to be playful and when to be serious.  I could dump her and hook up with someone closer to my age and end up with a miserable immature loser like the one you got.     If you love your woman, accept her as she is .... including her flaws. You cant change people. What you see is what you get.  If you dont like your woman, it might be time to consider upgrading. I could recommend a great dating agency that works miracles but you problably dont live in my locality anways.|`|qq159sWMaa	Tell her how you feel about all of this.  Sit down and have a chat about the expectations when it comes to chores and household things find out what hers are and let her know yours-- see if you can find some middle ground.|`|AA11447210	Perhaps you two simply aren't a good match as a couple. You might suggest she get counseling if she wants to mature and be more independent and assertive, but that's also asking her to change who she is. If she's not willing to change or grow up to meet your desires then you have to accept her as she is, or move on romantically.     Sometimes we meet people who we like and are attracted to on many levels, but bottom line is we aren't a good match romantically.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	If you don't match up with someone, then you don't match up. Nothing much you can do. I say end the romantic/sexual part of this relationship, try to salvage the friendship, and find someone with whom you are more evenly paired. This girl just isn't the one for you.|`|AA10711210	I hate to say this, but I think things can only get worse. You might save it by sitting her down and going through what you put in your question and give the ultimatum: start growing up or you will walk. The hard thing is, if she can't/won't after, say, a month or two, then you have to walk!|`|DlaEYOC5aa	Just sit her down and talk to her.  she might not even realise that she has been hurting you in some of her ways.  i bet she will understand and change if she loves you as much as you do.

jxpa713daa	he may of liked you a month ago but from what im getting from you - you made it clear you didnt like him  and even if you do like him he took it that you didnt because of the lack of comunication    if you like the guy go ask for his phone number next time you see a chance and call him some times, everyone likes to be called, and just talk    if he liked you before, but he hit a "down" patch then this will bring him back up to liking you    if you dont like him then why does it matter?    So id say, he did like you, but hes thinking that you guys are too diffrent and hes out of your league  weather this is true or not im not sure|`|eAp6l4rXaa	Hi chocolate, I think he does like you, but you can test him somehow, I am sure you know how without making it too obvious.|`|RcCVL00Laa	its kind of an unsure thing at the moment. but if u feel he does just take a chance and ask him out.  the worst thing he can do is say no.  good luck hon.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	go talk to him, i find that if a women comes up to me, i know shes diggin......|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yeah he likes you|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i think he likes you. go for it if you like him! hope this helps!|`|DbMCubDuaa	It seems that he likes you. You really can't be that sure. Your going to have to start talking to him again, and i think you should start flirting with him after that. Hopefully that will help you determine his feelings and also be aware of anything he does that can be considered flirting. When you're ready you should ask him out, this will make it a lot more likely of you 2 going out together.

Download a free version of Avira Antivir, it will clean it up...But, Antivir updates every day (fortunately, it's fast), that makes it annoying when you're trying to do something else, but it's also what makes it effective...At least once a day when Antivir updates, it will give you an ad to buy the full version, just click it out...Or you could completely remove the Antivir after it clears up your current problem.    My husband is a computer geek...We have 5 computers...He has put this on all of them...I turn it off when I play my MMORPG so the updates don't kick me off my server:  http://www.free-av.com/|`|DB7UMkGCaa	I swear by a freebie software called Avast. Its free and thorough.    http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    Be forewarned, when I used avast, it found so many of my files infected, many of which were important windows software that was needed to run the computer. The Avast software gave me the option of deleting or not deleting that infected software. I chose delete on all of them.    It took several hours for Avast to go through my system and it was finding infected file after infected file. Avast would give me the options of deleting, repairing, "moving to chest", etc each and every infected file it found. After a long while of individually choosing to delete the first few infected files one by one, I realized that this would take forever, so I finally chose "delete all" on one of them, and as a result of that, the Avast software stopped giving me those above mentioned options and went ahead on its own and deleted each and every infected file it found. ALOT of these files that were infected were indeed very important Windows software files that I needed to run the OS. So, after several hours, when the Avast software had finished deleting all those infected files, and the computer restarted I couldnt get my "Windows" back.     The computer would start up, it would give me that logon thing where you have to enter your user name and password. Since I never entered a password for the computer, I just clicked on "Ok" to enter windows. I would get the background on my computer screen, but no Windows icons, no taskbar, etc. And in only a second after the computer started up, the computer would restart itself again. It was clear that the Avast software had gotten rid of ALOT of major Windows software that was necessary to run the computer properly.     So I did a Windows reinstall using the reinstall CD, and that did the trick. I got my windows back AND thanks to avast, I got my computer back, virus free.     Malwarebytes is an ok anti-virus software, but it would find only a mere handfull of infected files. And I would think I got the problem licked, only to have the virus come back. Avast found infected files that malwarebytes failed to identify.     My opinion: Get malwarebytes (free) and use that to somewhat clean out your system. (You will need to do that in order to install avast because some viruses tries to prevent you from installing and running anti-virus software. Malware bytes will help keep that virus down temporarilly while you are installing avast)    THEN go over to avast, and download and install and run that. THEN be prepared to reinstall your windows software (you should have a windows reinstallation CD) because, like I said before, you just might be forced by avast to get rid of alot of important windows files so obviously you will need to reinstall them again.

cwmcALJyaa	I'm short and I have no trouble making friends. I don't think height matters  its personality. Height may matter on the dating scene--people may be more particular about their match but for people just making friends it shouldn't matter and if it does then who really wants a judgmental ignorant person for a friend.|`|GtVJpgnUaa	I guess I haven't come upon this yet? Where I am, people don't really care on other people due to HEIGHT. i have loads of friends {not close but still friends} (guys & girls) who are shorter than me [ i'm pretty tall or average ] but if that IS true, which I have not stumbled upon yet but may do in the future, I'm with you if you find it stupid. as a girl, i am not really into boyfriends if that's what you meant by "girls warming up". but if you meant just as friends, i don't really judge people with heights. i mean i remember making friends with this guy for a day who was shorter than me. ;] it was pretty fun comparing his height to others but we just had fun with it. if that's true then i really don't know. "new fad?" that sounds a bit stupid but you never know ;] when i stumble upon it i'll tell ya, hopefully. but i'm with you if that's true|`|EhQyJE14aa	So not true - I'm short (I prefer, petite) and all my friends are tall.

Of course, there's no problem with meeting new people and what I think your problem is that you're just not used to other people and therefore it makes you uncomfortable to be around them.  It'll take a few more times being around them for you to feel more comfortable; it's not necessarily that you're not "fitting in".     But if you keep talking to them and still don't feel comfortable after awhile, realize that having bunches of friends is over-rated.  In my mind, having tons of friends is more of a hassle than anything.    Maybe you should talk to more people that share your interests.  For example, I'm on the cross country team and most of my close friends are also.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Well if they wont try and start a converation or include you in a converation they are not very  nice. i dont think you should hang about with them if they dont inclued you in anything.

dGL5xCrqaa	It's always nice to fall in love again, everyone needs someone. If you're worried about your daughters, they would understand, but definitely talk with them to keep them in the loop. If my dad ever found love I would want him to tell me so that I could say, "I'm really happy for you and I support anything that makes you happy and fulfilled."  If you love this woman, go for it. You only live once, and you want it to be a good one.    Best of luck and congratulations on falling in love.|`|Bnj2ftpzaa	I would talk to your daughters first. make sure they approve of this new addition to their lives and then if they are keen on it, make the move!|`|mxrlZEweaa	It's good that you found someone. It's only been 3 months it might be to soon to say "I love You " unless you know she feels the same way. Have you guys talked about how serious you two are, or is this just a casual thing. You guys should be on the same page. Talk to her. Don't just blurt it out and surprise her with it.|`|AA10941788	I would take things slow. Date her a little bit longer. Don't go to fast and I would wait until you are sure with this woman on meeting your girls. I would talk to your girls too before making any move because it does affect their lives too. You have to make sure you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman. You need to be careful  Talk to her and see how she feels too. That will tell you more where you stand with her    I am happy for you and I wish you the best    EDIT: Jessalynn, You are so wrong and have no clue what your talking about. That is so untrue. My ex remarried and the woman he married has treated my daughter fine. There will always be trials. That's the way it is. Hun, Get your facts straight|`|LMtvmRh6aa	I think you should tell her you love her.Maybe she loves you back.Good luck and i hoped i helped.|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	My advice, concentrate on raising your daughters. Blended families are almost always a nightmare. Your daughters maybe like her now but will not like a new wife in the picture. Your new wife will probably be driven crazy by the girls.    The 37 year old needs to find a guy without kids. Either stay single or get back together with your ex.|`|ObmQoa6eaa	ask her first and talk to your daughters too.|`|IsMkhAJ5aa	im sure ur daughters will understand. if she makes u happy they should support u unless they r mad about the divorce. but even if they dont support u u should still tell her how u feel. if u love her tell her. love is something that u dont come across often and if u have that chemistry u should chase it. talk to ur girls and ask how they feel about her. if they like her then ur a very lucky guy. i hope it goes well =]|`|0nX92Fesaa	Its good to feel Love again, and what important is to learn from your past experience. Please don't rush things up... study more of her personality and what she likes or doesn't....Ask her questions about her preferences and what she likes in a man and what she is up to... whats her personal experience and why she is single too?    In your situation you should focus more in forming a healthy relationship that will last forever without any downfall or traps....    In my personal sight, I would recommend to take it slow  with her.... and don't forget to have your daughter's point of view on this.....    For the very first stages, you need to go out with her,you name it :  movies, restaurants....picnics.....anywhere just give it an ear and listen up ....      Because going into a relationship without knowing your daughter/s will only put you into trouble....      I hope you find this soothing|`|cQn9ZqUgaa	Tell her the truth. maybe she loves you to and wants the relationship to go a little further, but she waiting you to ask her. Guys don't get that some girls are to shy to them out or say any real feelings to the guy they love. But ask your daughters about it first. Parents are another thing they don't ask there children about it they just think it's ok because there the boss but it's not, because they might not like her and they may like her. But i don't think you don't want your children to be unhappy about your decision, and the future there life will be miserable because you didn't ask them if they would mind if your go out with her. Also i think you wait a little bit a time for the children to use to the divorced. And maybe the girl you love is waiting a little longer until it's the right time for you guys to go out.
ETV7yvNbaa	Yes, it's too much. Here is something to think about...."Would I still like him without the physical stuff?" or "What would our relationship be like without the sex?" Seems to me that you guys have built a bad foundation. You need to be getting to know each other in other ways. Relationships like that don't last...the thrill will leave, and you will be left barely knowing why you got with him.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	It is unusual but it is your norm. But I would think both you and he would get very sore.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Five times a day? Wow. That is a lot .... but then it's normal to be all over each other early in a relationship, this will ease off over time, and if you stay together long enough, it will be down to once or twice a week. Quality over quantity every day, hon!|`|K5uoaetaaa	Seriously abnormal - 5 times a year is about right.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	yes|`|PSsVYQTmaa	5 times in one day? lol wow that is kinda a lot, but it just means u guys are really attracted to eachother! Its good, just don't let ur realtionship turn into only physical|`|yTGhMW4Uaa	I have sex pretty much every night but with a different girl and its amazing  so yes its normal in my book|`|FsQez6wGaa	i'd do it that much, so i dont think so.|`|v9ihmSoNaa	u guys are really attrcted hey?|`|dROrlLvhaa	yea thats fine, just as long as your not in any pain, and your seeing the gyno once a year for checkup (dont forget protection)|`|HRUZ8HhFaa	ummmmm you need serious help, i recommend Maury Povish.|`|2mXedU1eaa	are you kidding me? sex is ****** awesome!!!!!! You can never have to much sex!!!!!!! thats like asking "is smoking weed 5 times a day too much" and i say NO way sex and weed are the best things on the planet!!! also, grape juice is pretty good.|`|egBR6eY7aa	Well if u both ve jus started seeing each other then its perfectly ok. These r the initial stages of a relationship where u cant keep ur hands of each other. Its fun. But if its been awhile like 2 yrs or 3 yrs and still going onn then ur blessed :) Have fun.
aZywR0j1aa	Of course, your friend is grieving terribly (I'm a widow myself, I do know) and it may seem as if the husband's family are being harsh and unreasonable. However, bear in mind that they too have just lost a close relative and are, no doubt, in shock and distress and probably not thinking straight. If she doesn't want to or can't afford to help mother in law then I suggest she says so. However perhaps she should consider that in-laws can sometimes be a help as well as a pain.|`|V1dNF1vCaa	I don't see why they can't remain friends, but don't you think her hubby might not want her to less involved with his family just because he died. That said, she shouldn't do anything she wouldn't have if he was alive.     Think of it from thier side though. They have lost a son and now they fear losing a special relationship with a daughter-in-law too. That's probably why they're being over-zealous about the marriage thing. She may well be the only thing in this life that connects them to thier son, assuming they didn't have children.|`|8b0564e4f294954027d36b00630751e6aa	It is very insensitive to ask anyone that is in bereavement to contribute money to anything; but she is still family just because their was a death of a spouse should not make her any less than family. What if the shoe was on the other foot; what if your friend needed to be near here in-laws for solace?    As for the money that is a conscience decision, if she does not have the money due to the expenses of her spouse funeral, if they are asking for a reimbursement because they helped with the immediate expenses to bury her husband, than she should pay them back.     As for the getting married statement form the in-laws her not hearing those word was her blessing from God, so that they don't haunt her for the rest of her life. Grief and death although have appropriate manners you can not hold dumb statement against the in-laws or at least shouldn't.|`|8d9219ccd2ad58a22a44c4a8dc45cb48aa	no.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	she was only related to them by marriage, so they should not expect her to pay their medical bills|`|96zZlJVYaa	only if she wanted to stay part of her husband family. she is not responsible to paid for in law hospital bills, nor wanted to join any of the family matters (problems, outings, family dinner, etc). she have the rights to move on when she is good and ready.|`|65879eecb0be58b339997b05c0d5c69faa	Somebody tell them that she has no financial obligations and whether or not she considers marrying again, ever, is not their concern.
CeyuSMT9aa	he is jesus|`|3OUMXsPbaa	for old women...he's dead yo.
AA10098448	hmm. well my boyfriend brought me to Wendy's and we had a feast there, and then he asked me out! we've been together for 2 (almost 3!) years.     it doesn't really matter what you do. just have fun. he'll enjoy it, and he'll know he's special because you chose to hang out with him on valentines day, out of all people!
K3gQHPy4aa	Well, im 14 too, and its funny my mom just talked to me the other day about money problems. All you have 2 do is just not spend as much, and just be careful of your money. Don't worry your parents will figure everything out so just try to be helpful and do the take shorter showers and turn off your lights stuff. It really does make a difference.|`|GbzrIwNdaa	yes, it can affect ur family as a whole so take ur parents into consideration and dont spend too much|`|0129b3a590a07a620eed88b2ae922b50aa	you actually really should, just don't get too worried, just hold back, get a job, earn and save your own money etc.|`|GHoGzxSOaa	yeah if you are 14 maybe u could get an afterschool paying job!
Bx6xTLRbaa	How's your personality??? Yes, guys just like girls care about looks to an extent but also, guys just like girls, can't stand to be around someone that just doesn't click with them.|`|JxDE5C85aa	It depends on the guy, some look for the personality and some look for a girl's beauty and then there are some who look for both.|`|9w8EW24daa	it will be different for all guys|`|SCff9vNBaa	yeah im sure he will. i mean, what more could a guy want?|`|VXPmIENCaa	you bet
36424029c639f9b8c3d1657f05d77994aa	I love them!  You did a great job!  They look professional. Did it take a long time?  Did you just design them on the computer and print them on a regular printer?  I want to do my own but it seems like A LOT of work!    BTW, I saw the dress pics and it's beautiful!|`|4POGapREaa	Wow, they're awesome.  I wasn't expecting that.  Fantastic job.  The only thing that threw me off a little was the font because I couldn't really make out what the bottom one even said on the right.  But, I do like them.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	VERY NICE!|`|pNrfE7fHaa	Wow, they look great!!!  The only think that I would change is the 'a' in and between your names should not be capitalized.  But that is just a minor nit-picky thing.  They look amazing!  Good job!|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Yeah they are very nice. Well i was recently inivited to a wedding and the bride made her own inviation and on the front card she put a picture of her when she was a child and and a picture of the groom when he was a child it was really cute looking. Thougth i would just let you know. Hope i helped. Hope u have a wonderful wedding.!|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I think they are beautiful.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Absolutely perfect!|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Ok, either do all black or all navy writing, the black and blue don't match. Second, I had no idea that was a cherry blossom, it looks like a man's manhood with hair.  Get something else on there in the navy that will actually look like what it's supposed to.  I love the folders though, the rest of it is cute.|`|5kfOepKSaa	There are really nice. The blue and silver is very classy.   Don't fuss about the small details of your wedding. People will come to your wedding if they care about you. It is Truly not about the invitation.
rAsjVItUaa	Its beautiful x x|`|4POGapREaa	I'm not seeing the bigger hips thing.  You seem to be pretty much proportionate.  The only thing I would suggest (please don't be mad) is that since you're not very toned in the arms & chest, you might want to go with more of a halter style on top.  The straight across strapless really pronounces that area & makes it one lump of flesh above the dress.  If you had something that went around the neck it would cut that area giving your shoulders a much nicer line.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	I thinks it's good.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Go for it! The dress fits your figure well!|`|di6p10Ifaa	Ohh girl you have got to get it!!! It looks amazing on you, by the way you have such a gorgeous figure! I think this is definately the gown for you! This gown is so incredible and very romantic! I hope you have a great wedding day and a happily ever after!    By the way you are beautifully toned. I think you have got a gorgeous body. You are not too toned to were you look like a bony stick but you are not plump. I think you are a happy medium. Don't let anyone bring you down, you look amazing in this dress and you know it! ;)|`|8kdjvWAxaa	I really like it!|`|MLFBsZnUaa	I think its a gorgeous dress and looks gorgeous on you. The only suggestion I could make (and I say this because I have a very similar figure...bigger in hip area, busty, and not super skinny or chubby, but conent with my weight)...is maybe have a halter added. It makes for a much more comfortable fit. I dont really agree with a previous comment made saying that it would be necessary for the look...I say it for your own comfort. Gives much better support. I opted for a halter so I wouldnt be tugging at my dress to pull it up all night, as I had already been doing it just at the dress shop. However, if the dress fits perfectly comfortable and you dont foresee that issue, then go for it right as it is. Hope that helped! again...looks gorgeous n very flattering!|`|5sCpMpbWaa	This is a really nice dress..|`|xde0uuuBaa	i think its pretty!!|`|5A7RmIH6aa	need to  lose 20 lbs..|`|eOBYBAG6aa	aww , my honest opinion is that its really really really beautiful !  seroiusly the dress is gorgeous and it flatter your figure , and as long as you love it , its perfect   goodluck & best wishes :) xxx|`|5f0bf3f6468576e3356dd41d60baca43aa	honestly? I think the dress is nice, but you need to tone up...|`|76db084b0636ae593b0b3c0e95cb3838aa	I think that the dress actually compliments your figure as it hugs in the right places and makes your hips look curvy in a good way, you have a really nice fuller figure and the dress works well with that.|`|qfbDMVKKaa	You look radiant in the dress.  And importantly, it felt right.  If you choose a veil I would wear a shoulder tip length.      And don't listen to rude people, not everyone in the world is a size 0.    Congrats|`|ZOt9DTEJaa	personally i really like the dress  and on you it looks perfect!  and if you had 'the moment' lol  thats the most important thing  making sure YOU feel its the right dress  =]  have fun at ur wedding!
8XKmMBU7aa	I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Sounds like he likes you and is way jealous of your bf. Probably thinks you're a tease.  Boys are stupid sometimes.|`|EzgodvQOaa	Guys always act different when there with there friends.. =|  but i think he likes you.. hes probably more confident when his friends are there because hes a boy and they show off allot.  but it seems like he likes you.. but hes just jealous of your boyfriend he also probably thinks you would say no if he asks you out so hes trying to keep distant from you  hope that helped.   take care.  x|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	umm cuz he likes u and is jealous|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Seems like hes hurt cuz you got a boyfriend|`|s4zxGI4naa	I think his denying it to himself that he loves you and keep saying that your just friends that's why he keeps answering your friends question that your just friends and nothing at all. He's afraid to confess that he likes you maybe because that something might change.|`|XfYqGLFSaa	hes just jealous of ur boyfriend when their jealous they don't talk to u that much nd ignore u that has happen to me before
VEEgoDkFaa	It means they are infested with pubic lice.  You can get rid of it by shaving all the pubic hair or by getting medication from the pharmacy. Trust. ';-()|`|AA11447210	Crabs are pubic lice...an STD people can get from sexual activity with someone else who has them. Read the source link for more information.     Perhaps they have crabs, or are being sarcastic and saying they don't desire to have sex with whomever they are speaking with (by trying to repel them).|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Having crabs means you have this certain STD.|`|LnwzW5h5aa	maybe they have pet crabs?  jk  lol if your bf told that RUN FAR AWAY|`|8uCuoLvdaa	Means he's inviting you out for a seafood dinner!  lol...
OUIAspBUaa	It means he could care less about what you think and how you feel. Why want someone that is only going to treat you like crap anyway?|`|IUlIixJLaa	Because some guys are so immature that they are confused and don't know how to act|`|KifasiMraa	It means he's a jerk and he's an idiot.  Even if he has a crush on you, do you really want a guy who shows his affection by being mean?  He doesn't seem like he respects women (or anyone really) very much. We teach people how to treat us.  Ignore him and this will show him that you demand respect and kindness and you are strong enough not to put up his bull**it.  You deserve a guy whose actually NICE to the girl he likes...|`|tO8ey3o8aa	hmm he mite like u  flirt|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Seems like he might like youuu|`|AA11635143	You are witnessing the development of an abuser.  He has an ego problem that makes him think he is superior to women and, therefore, has the right to abuse them.    You need to keep your distance from this guy and find someone who is loving, gentle, and kind.  Forget this loser.|`|TBhjp3DXaa	sounds like he might like you, but his tactics are all wrong!|`|ZUCkh7dmaa	This usually means he thinks by being awful to you, you will try as best as you can to please him. :) Don't fall for it.
meQ3jP3zaa	Guys are clueless so he might not realise u took is Q that way but he mit be into just ask were if ur invited for a coffee u shud just be friends but if u got invited to a fancy restraunt that means HE DIGS U!!|`|kBek6QCLaa	;}     I think you know|`|NEH7JWNMaa	mkay I'm not a rocket scientist or in the 9th grade or anything. but I think it means he'd like to go out with you.

We were soo soaking wet, surprised cause we didn't get sick the next day.  & soo much more.  my friends and i are random, aha|`|laL0bqSsaa	The funnest is to get in old cars and go in the mountains.  Find a hill that is really steep and go about 90 to fly off of it.  Its dangerous but fun.  Walk around WalMart at late hours.  Take millions of pictures.  Sneak behind the city lake at midnight or later.  Getting the cops called on us.  Go to the late movies.  Hang up giant underwear in the principles office, on the ceiling.  Fill teachers rooms with a million blown up balloons.  Just simply have fun.  |`|EJKhLW2Baa	go to nightclubs/cinema shopping. normal every day stuff|`|oCaf3238aa	i am a teenager.  mall  tee-peeing  ding dong ditching  movies  skating  walk around in walmart  crash your ex boyfriends party =D -my fave-  prank calling
mKCiofUFaa	Start to love yourself and not have to rely on some "rebound" guy to do it for you. Once you rebuilt your strength from your breakup, you will be able to find true love.|`|qwveESAFaa	Use it as a life lesson, and move on.|`|AA11401294	he probably faked his death
pW9KhTFvaa	Unfortunately it is difficult for many people to sleep with someone and not have some feelings whether it be love, guilt, jealousy, or others.  He probably lied because he felt guilty for sleeping with someone else.  It's a natural reaction and we aren't trained as children to manage "unconventional relationships" such as the one that the two of you maintain.  He is probably just trying to figure out the rules, if you will, for the situation.  Give him another chance but don't let him off the hook for lying to you.|`|Maw87YWdaa	Im be upset too.  I would just walk away from him.|`|BK0yADLCaa	well i think that you have a reason to be pissed because he did lie to you! i say talk to him and figure it all out|`|Bydye6Muaa	yeah, he lied|`|RTUCzzixaa	I hate liars more than anything else!|`|p2Wh2HoJaa	This is a very hard scenario. I think that you have the right to be pissed at him especially since you just got out of a relationship not long ago. He has no right to lie to you about liking you and sleeping with only you. You may want to talk to him about it and pay special attention to what his excuse may be and how he says it. Might help you figure out whether he's lying.
M1UiYHi5aa	yes you don't want to teach your son that married life and love is all about fighting and screaming. my parents arent together and i have a very happy life!! i love my step parents. and if me and my husband never got a long i would leave him so it doesnt affectmy son in the wrong way|`|dzyJw0cvaa	If you and your ex fought all the time, then you difinitely did the right thing.  It took me 6 years to figure out that it was better for me to be a single mom than to fight with my husband in front of the kids the whole time thinking that we were a family unit and divorce would mess up the kids. It is quite the opposite.  Children who grow up in a happy healthy one parent home are far better off than children who grow up in a dysfunctional two parent home.  I also prefer to have both parents involved.  Children need a mother and a father.  but if mother and father just are not happy together, it is far more damaging than having just one parent ever could be.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	yes you did. why make him go though all the fighting. as long as you and your ex to be try and get along the best you can for his sake he will be just fine.   try and work thing out with visitations that best fits him.  workout what is best for your son.  see him as much as you can. you can go for more than one day a week for visitation and you get 6 weeks out of the summer.|`|58H53s8maa	i think you just have to do whats best for you ...having a child in a bad enviornment like that all the time is not good.  you obviosly dont want to be with her anymore and i dont think you should have stayed to put yourself through that anymore..and its not like you wont ever get to see your son. it will be better for him seeing you guys calm and not fighting everytime hes around you. just dont let your divorce get in the way and have nasty fights about things with that becuase then it can be worse.  My parents split up about three years ago now and i think its so much better. and yes its wierd at first but i got over it and i enjoy them so much more not fighting all the time|`|Bc5v99Zfaa	YES!|`|Enr7zACMaa	Yes you did the right thing because my parents  got a divorce but they held it off for awhile. They didn't do the right thing becasue when I heard them fight it made me cry everynight. Your child is better off having 2 houses and friendly parents than 1 house and fighting parents that make you sad.My parents got divorced when I was 6 and I told myself that it would be easier if my parents got divorced when I was younger because I wouldn't know then as well as a couple so the divorce would of been easier.|`|9P0TiiX4aa	You did do the right thing, my parents have gotten seperated and back together twice. I overheard them talking about how the reason they got back together was because of me and how once I go to college my dad will move out again. I miss them being seperated, it was much better to just see each of them seperately than have to live seeing them miserable with eachother. I hope this helped|`|AXr4Sx5raa	Yes . But you must keep in contact with your son. Don't fight in front of them.
oLTUn51Uaa	maybe u don't make urself open enough to date|`|AA10579644	Maybe your playing ""hard to get"".

jV99kgWbaa	It's never too late to try to regain a friend, but you need to be prepared for the consequences. Your friend may never get over what happened and may not want to rekindle a friendship with you -- ever.    If you believe you can handle permanent rejection, and you are sure you don't just want to be friends again in order to get to the brother, you could seek your friend's forgiveness -- but I doubt that is going to happen if you make another play for her brother so soon.    You're confused about what to do, so perhaps you are not "madly in love" as much as madly in love with the idea of getting back with the brother.    The best thing to do in these kind of circumstances is the right thing.  But that's also the most difficult thing when emotions are strong.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH!...    Sucks to be you|`|onAEy5jTaa	uh...... I speak English.

If you don't say anything, nothing can be resolved. Good Luck.|`|L48jgZuRaa	I think you should forget her brother!      I think so for that matter because I think that friendship is more important than a guy!|`|yC7jXmK1aa	You should still try. If you don't, you'll always wonder "what if..." Tell her that you were pressured into it. That you would take it all back if you could and you have grown a lot from the experience. And losing her as a friend wasn't worth it. If she still doesn't budge, then I say go to her brother and talk to him about it. He might be able to help you get her back as a friend and he might realize how caring you are and he might start to like you! =]|`|HSsBhRRyaa	Opening old wounds is never a good idea. There are plenty of other men in the world. Sit down and think about what you want in a man (without thinking about your friends brother) and seek out something new and interesting, maybe along the way mend things up with your friend. Guys come and go, Friends stay forever.|`|DlaEYOC5aa	Dont really understand your question , but i suggest you speak to him and tell him everything before he finds out from someone else.  If he forgives you, great if not, at least you will know that you tried.  Good luck|`|l5IjG90oaa	You are not madly in love, it's called fatuation. That's why you ****** him.|`|t65TF492aa	forget what people are telling you,  but i think u should try to forget also about the guy, and if your friend was really your friend she would have understood what u did and stop acting like that and talk to u, and build that friendship that yall had again. but eventually she just doesnt fit into ur life, try to forget about her and him, and move on to better people. and probably better friends. Think about it.|`|YNyFDwupaa	try to talk to them. Ask them if you can explain what happened. If they say no give them some space. if they say yes explain it all to them. You should at least try to explain to them how you were pressured into it. Try to make them understand. Make sure they know how much they mean to you. Good Luck! I hope everything works out!|`|e8ocUrV5aa	Relax!! There is still all the time in the world left for you to get your side of the story out there. You have to realize that even though it may have been a "drunken night", and some people made some mistakes, doesn't mean it's entirely your fault. So, go out there and tell them what you feel is right and put some confidence in yourself that you won't let the same mistakes happen again. Good Luck in all you do!!|`|Q89HRy3Yaa	well that's a hard one i mean if you really love him you have to go for it, but she's also your best friend and you don't want to loose her but this is your life and if you love him you need to tell him and let him decide and after you talk to him talk to your friend DO NOT KEEP IT A SECRET!    but i think you need to go for it.
Kp6JYaMAaa	FIND HER and ask for her number :)
cdQryr7paa	My guess is he has something to hide.  Like a wife or gf that could hear him on the phone.  He keeps the calls short so that they don't draw attention on the bill.  If he is thousands of miles away, what makes you think you can actually know him very well, or think you will ever be able to meet him face to face?  He is telling you all he feels, but if you start saying you feel the same way, he doesn't want to take the chance that you want to find a way to come visit him, or ask him to come to you.  He is hiding you from someone.  Just stop talking to him, and find someone you can talk to and get to know face to face without computers or phones.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	why not just call him and ask him or meet some place half way between you both and talk face to face|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Trust that idea that's in your head right now. If he really cared for you and he put off a phone call already just imagine when things get tough.  Needles to say he wants you there, think of his motives and reasons if you did.Put that idea of of your head, at least for now!  Long distance can work, but after reading what you said I wouldn't risk getting involved and then hurt|`|qwveESAFaa	Follow your gut on this one.  You will probably be sorry later if you don't.  He might even be married (which accounts for the short calls).   Find a real person locally if you can.  There is nothing like the real thing, baby.|`|b5UV15gCaa	ok first of all you have never met the guy. Don't trust him. Never meet him without someone with you. My neighbor is this fat balding guy who hits on girls online. He says nice things to them and makes them feel special. and posts pics of some really hot guy on the internet. so the girls think he is someone he is not. One girl finally asked him to take a picture of himself holding a red sucker. he didn't so she was smart and quit talking to him. Beware, people are not what they seem on the internet... don't get me wrong there are some really nice people on here but don't trust people you don't really KNOW!
WvOvoxLxaa	Give it time and see what comes out of talking. You also have to remember why you and him broke up all those years ago. You are older now so hopefully wiser also.  Ask yourself why you haven't had a boyfriend for all those years, are you hiding from the world.|`|dZ1efw1Paa	If he has a girlfriend now then don't do anything.  Even if he's single, I'd start by becoming close to him again and then going for it. If you just ask him out now it might scare him away.|`|xd2JuXyEaa	Yes go for it. You wouldn't know unless you tried. I don;t know if you are looking for a relationship  or just to be friends. you will just have to start talking with him and see how he responds and then you will know where you stand .|`|NCNYmOPCaa	Do what you want i dont care

He is way to old for you at your age (20/23 y/o is a different story), and telling you he doesn't want a girlfriend involved in a sport is ridiculous and controlling. Please don't waste your time on being obsessed with a boy who will tell you what you can/can not do-like waiting for him until his b-day, as well-you are to young! I know you probably just blow this answer off, and at your age you REALLY want a boyfriend, but it is something you can and should wait for, and the biggest reason would be to wait for a boy who wants you exactly the way you are!

But, with time and the help of your really close friends and family you heart will heal. Being hurt by someone is never easy. But, it is something we all go through.

Don't give up on love.|`|AXr4Sx5raa	Yes you will. in time . you need a good friend who will be there for you.  you need to get out and find something to fill the void|`|21TogLbJaa	the pain will ease my friend in time|`|44mmJ14Caa	IM SURE HES GOT A BEST FRIEND FIND HIM HANG OUT WITH HIM MAKE THE BASTARD MISS U FOR REAL SHOW HIM HOW IT FEELS AND THEN IT WILL BE EASY TO MOVE ON|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Although it seems like it now, you will get over him. It's always hard when a bf leaves you, but it seems 10X worse when it's you first AND it was for another girl. Hold your head up sweetie and realize he wasn't worth your time and you're better off without him. It will most likely happen to her also because that's the type of guy he is. You were and are too good for him and someone else out there will be more compatable for you. Cheer up sweetie,it's all a part of growing up and this will only make you stronger with life's situations.
5oJYzjotaa	There's not much you can do. It's on him to make a good impression.|`|ygimTNzoaa	My parents and older sister are very judgmental. I say dont talk unless youre spoken to and smile. Be polite and manors! My god parents love manors lol. Dont be too cheesy, but shake their hand and eye contact when first meeting is good. Just sit there and shut up. But dont be afraid to sit close to you or hold your hand, your parents want to know he cares for you. Yea thats all I got, good luck. ALWAYS be honest, because nothings worse then getting caught up in a lie. And if you must lie, reherse the lie before so you both know the story lol.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Relax. We all go through this.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Just tell him ahead of  time what to be warned for.

My niece hated it at first but now she knows we did it all in fun and to make she the guy wasn't a creep. Don't worry about it and just remember to be respectful since it is your parents.

He's so shy so he just sat and talked with them for a little bit till i said we were gonna go in my room to watch a movie.  As long as he acts like a nice guy they should like him.  At first i was really nervous cuz my bf is 20 (I'm 17) and has a tattoo and piercings but luckily my parents didn't mind.|`|bj9Y4z16aa	the only thing you can do is be yourself and your bf.  hope it's all gone ok as it's nearly 8.00 so he is all ready been and probably gone?|`|sV0fKe6jaa	being nervous just makes it worse.

BE POLITE,LOOK INTO THE EYES OF YOUR PARENTS WHEN SPEAKING TO THEM....    DO NOT KISS INFRONT OF YOUR PARENTS..WHEN HE LEAVES JUST A HUG,(if parents are not looking,kiss him)    MAKE SURE YOU GET FEEDBACK FROM YOUR PARENTS IF THEY LIKED HIM OR NOT,that way you know what he needs to improve...but dont tell your boyfriend what they did not like,it may make him feel bad....just kinda make the conversation flow into what hw should do different....         this happened to me 3 years ago with my boyfriend,which is now my faince,and my parents love him....

If it is true and you can get on the computer and ask questions about your husband you can call for help or  call a shelter or 911. If this is true please for your sake get yourself out of this situation immediately.    You deserve the love and respect and care that you need.    If you need help google a local shelter in your area or call the police before he hurts you or your unborn child.    I wish the very best for you.

Now if she hates housework she should of gave you jaw dropping sex and maybe you the man would of overlooked her slovenly ways....|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I do agree, she is not being the supportive wife that you need. It does take a lot to be a military wife (speaking from experience) however if you're not cut out for it, then you have to be honest and make a decision. Expecting you to do your job, then come home and do hers is wrong.  One thing to know, if you send the papers while you're overseas and she contests you'll have to wait until you get home to finish the divorce because you will need a lawyer.  Be safe and thank you for serving.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	If you send divorce papers to her while you are deployed it is not in your & your children's best interest. Right now you are feeling pain, and anger because you are lacking support and love, so no wonder you want to take action that is aggressive. Honor your feelings, but don't allow them to run your life. Instead take this time to figure out why you got invovled with her, and then look at the relationship and find the patterns that have repeated themselves, Once you define what has happened you can begin to understand, take responsibility for your part in reacting and all your own actions, and forgive yourself. This will lift you to a greater awareness. Then you can begin to understand a little about your wife, and forgive her.   In doing this you are releasing all the emotions and ways of being that have held you back from getting the love you really want and really deserve. Be kind and supportive to her, because regardless, you picked her to be the mother of your children. If you are kind to her you will help her be good to the kids, Then when you get home, have a discussion about your future. By the time you get home you will have had a chance to figure out what is best. Remember that if you just serve divorce papers she will get primary custody of the children and you will be paying her spousal support and for child support for the children, and because you are not home you can't talk to your children or help them through a difficult time. Consider waiting so if you can't pull it together you can at least separate fairly, tell the children together, and be a father to them.   When she gets nasty cut her off...you never have to take abuse.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	yes it would be wrong you should face your problem head on|`|FtyLwqR5aa	not at all.

Good Luck and be safe!!!|`|AA10289805	The only question you need to ask yourself is this: Are you happy with this woman being in your life? If the answer is 'No," I'd first recommend counseling. If that's not an option, then I think divorce would be a good thing. The problem would be the kids, and that she might be the vindictive type.    Good luck, man. I wish you well.|`|dfhmx7a9aa	I think you are in a very difficult situation. I also am a military wife who is going through a divorce. My husband has cheated on me our entire 8 year marriage and now sent me divorce papers so I know. With all that said maybe now is not the time to make such a life changing decision for you and your children. Maybe she is just so lonely like a lot of military spouses, just maybe things could change? You may not think you want that right now being millions of miles away but just maybe things could change. Marriage really should be forever through better and especially through worse!!|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Thank you for your service and keeping us all safe.  Those of you in the military do not get enough credit for what you do for all of us.  Thank you really doesn't quite cover it.    I see no reason to stay married to her.    My only concern is for your children - how will they take it without you there to talk to them about it?  Something to consider.  As a mother I really worry about them.|`|rJ9Zkx35aa	You are in another country fighting for her Freedoms! Do what you feel is best.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	You have alot riding on your mind, and it should not be that way. Keep your head up and think straight, If the bad has out weighed the good, it's time to make Changes, What ever you decide it might be ,It has to be with you and your children.  You are not a stupid person you know what the hell is going on.  Good luck to you! And Finally, Thank you for your protection. USA loves you all! peace my friend.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	That is really such a shame Tony...I agree with you on the issue of taking care of the kids being a "motherly" thing. It was unfair for her to say that to you about your children.  As far as being your wife, she needs to take care of you!  You take care of her for goodness sake!  If it means anything at all Tony....I respect what you do for me and this country everyday and I want to thank you for all you're doing.  It must be really lonely being deployed out of the country and your wife not sending you any mail or anything.  Personally I think she takes you for granted.  If you're not happy with her and don't feel like you can talk to her about it then I can't blame you for wanting a divorce.  You do deserve better in a wife and companion.  I wish you well in your dilemma whether or not to divorce her.  If you need a "pen pal" I'd be happy to be yours.  Good Luck!

Guy did that to me once, it was hilarious :P Well to me. Thing is though... some girls are good with people touching their hair, other girls would be pissed at you for doing that. Prissy girls are the ones who would have a problem with it. Laid back casual girls probably wouldn't.    "That sweater looks great on you"... do not say "You look great in that sweater" Think about it this way, the first was more saying she always looks great, and that the sweater looks great ON her. The SECOND one is saying that she only looks great wearing that sweater. Think about it that way, you want her to know she's always great, not that she's great at a specific time.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	"You look like a doll!"  "You're gorgeous"  "Cute."

LC3TGSr3aa	Well I'll skip to the why I'm waiting.   Because obviously I'm going to call the person I am so desperately in love with.   Though there's one problem,   He left. Literally left. Not like saying I want to see other people he just up and said he's moving and I haven't seen him in a total of two months. And because I was stubborn and angry I threw his phone number away and I honestly have no idea what it is.     Just goes to show you should say everything you need to when you have the chance.|`|Bf4amjuBaa	My family and friends i would say i love you goodbye and ask christ into my heart again just to make sure.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Everyone I knew and say lets have a party and celebrate my life.|`|vGHExDOzaa	Um i would call my mom first then call my bff because if i died she would bring me back and kill me herself if i didn't call her before i died we are waiting because the fact that death is very very depressing so we try not to think about it at all|`|oCaf3238aa	id call the guys i like and tell them|`|7tibLPi2aa	I would call...My mom if i could only call 1 person but if I could call 2 I would call my mom and my sister. And then I would ask Jesus to forgive my sins one final time.|`|v011fxgraa	If I was going to die, I would call my dad, because he is the only parent left for me. My mom dies already when I was 5. What I would have said to my dad is that "I am sorry for whatever i have done wrong, and hope you can forgive me. I love you. Hope you have a wonderful future. also say hello and my love to everyone i know."
t0MiDBMEaa	It's a different world now than the time when she was your age.  She is being protective of you because she doesn't want anything to happen to her daughter.  Why don't you join some sports so you can have fun and get more friends outside of school. Also, try telling her your frustration about having no life and maybe she will work with you.  But, remember if she does loosen the chain don't take advantage of it and make back decisions.  Good Luck.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Please don't use gay as a derogative word. She has your best interests at heart. They may seem restricting now however.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	That is insane, but she can't keep you from dating after you are 18. She can't do anything after you are an adult, age 18.|`|7YWaao6Raa	just dont tell ur parents about ur bf!  secretcy|`|CdTe8MO4aa	you know how you can really scare her say you know mommy i love you so much im going to live with you till im 40  lol|`|EVpsVgokaa	Shes Just playing|`|ddf488e8aadc005298da52c8383e091faa	Well,you are in 8th grade. Im only in 6th and my mom says i cant date until 7th grade. But she doesn't let me go out with my friends either. But yea,your in 8th grade. Your mom is being stupid...|`|jtjISk6qaa	totally|`|1s6mQJqOaa	My dad will not let me date until I am like in my 20s so I feel your pain about the friend thing I think she is being very controlling, maybe you should talk to her about it, as lame as that sounds, it can help! GOOD LUCK! :)|`|ycRwO0kWaa	u r dumb don't call u mama stupid|`|ceE9aNg2aa	Umm...How interesting. Are you sure she wasn't joking?|`|aXqi9lYJaa	This usually would be bad advice, but just date and not tell her.    Yes she's being stupid.|`|hhrMwnMAaa	i think she is just saying this! she probably doesnt want to let you go out in take that step! but she will come around eventually   Best Wishes|`|lIfeAsb3aa	Wow your mom's a douche, I mean the dating could wait til high school, but no friends? That's totally gay.       Well at least once you are 18 you can have your own great life with friends an guys and show your mom up and rub it in her face. :]|`|U5AXg5Ghaa	shes just being sarcastic.     duhh.|`|AB5erhhUaa	Wow that's gay, I'm 13 and I've been on tons of dates and I makeout and all that. That's not right.|`|p2JAB5Z0aa	STAB HER...|`|dROrlLvhaa	She is probably joking! But I'm sure you'll date in high school, it's part of growing up!|`|aTMpCe32aa	that would get annoyingg.    she wants u 2 be safe.    she may have had a experiences with dating.|`|ayPAKhngaa	first of all gay means homosexueal, not stupid.    my mom is exactly the same, she won't let me sleepover go to the mall or movies. i know she's just worrying about me, but it's still annoying. i feel ur pain.|`|xWGKB0NZaa	Either your mom was joking, or she's crazy. Sounds like my Mom... you might have to do a lot of rebelling to get her to loosen up.|`|xQAcYIB9aa	My Mom used to say I couldn't have sex until I was 30 years old. Mom's don't want to imagine their children growing up. Of course you can do what you want, but Mom's have a tendency to make you think otherwise. (She doesn't want to tell you you can date now and then find out because she allowed it to happen, you are having a baby at 16. It's true, they really think this way.)|`|b8a3a3de3ff9b2402cfe47da112e1149aa	dude im in 9th grade and i have the same problem. except  my dad says i can never date. hes trying to get me to become a nun. uh! yes she is being gay|`|RyYWzEZcaa	Sounds like typical mom stuff...my dad said I couldn't get married until I was 30 and here I am 26 with husband and 3 kids!  Really, though, you are in the 8th grade...what's the hurry?  The purpose of dating is to find a future mate and I am betting you aren't ready to be married just yet!  Have fun just hanging with friends and enjoying being young with minimal responsibility.  And, as far as the future goes, once you're of legal age you can do whatever anyway!  You won't be denied the change of a happy life if you fight hard enough for it

Prepare some nice valentines cookie recipe in the shape of heart and I'm sure your partner will love it.     Romantic long drive and a candle light dinner is a fabulous idea.

I know she likes the piece (Bella's Lullaby from Twilight) so maybe you could do something like this or similar.    Try and make it personal, like you say, chocolates doesn't really show love or effort, just shows you went to a shop! Maybe paint something if you can (I know I can't) or a homemade card?

Did a friend do it as a joke, or was it someone you don't like trying to actually hurt you?  Was it a girl?  You have to give a bit more information for a decent answer.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	try to not hit the floor and pass out lol okey dokey|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Keep a distance from that person.

Good luck!|`|7bKDz2C9aa	I know how you feel. The same thing goes on with me, but you should tell your best friend and ask them to ask him who he likes. If it's not you then personally I wouldn't ask him but you are you and you know your best interests|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	well that's difficult. First i think u should get to know him and being popular and not popular doesn't have to do anything with love|`|KT0UTX8taa	Gather up the courage and go talk to him! I know it sounds scary and difficult, but if you really like him that much, and you let him, go, you will not be able to forgive yourself for the rest of your life!

qd5TkTEraa	Do you know anything about this girl, what she likes, etc. How old is she?    If she is your age ask her to do something that you think people your age would like to do or just ask her out for some hot chocolate on a cold day. No one can resist hot chocolate. Be yourself and sincere and you will be just fine. Don't try to do anything big or fancy just something simple. Just remember she will probably be a little nervous as well so the the most simple things to start usually work out better!    Best of luck to you  : )|`|4swYFtsSaa	"my friend wants to know would you meet me "|`|xUW1hTJOaa	just talk to her and compliment her and then just be like want to hangout sometime|`|EzgodvQOaa	' if i asked you out what would you say ?' thats what all the guys say =|  you should say something like ''i really like you..Would you go out with me ?''

PqfDgJubaa	Definately sounds like he is into you. If you really like this guy ask him out yourself. Guys like it when girls ask them out! If you dont know him that well and arent comfortable asking him face to face just try using msn and ask him to meet up with you.|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	yes he is interested!|`|Frji3qbwaa	ignor your friend belive what you belive|`|TRn53Ihfaa	maybe hes just teasing you|`|wBxXGASgaa	dependsd if ur rushing the gun but be friends first then decide|`|15dHhJtwaa	he definitely likes you, but i cant tell if he likes you more than a really good friend.  He might seriously not know you well enough, so ask him to hang out but invite other people so it doesn't look like your coming on too strong.  The heart definitely says he's interested...but doesn't know yet. wait til the i love yous. (spelled out) then you know he does. Good Luck! :)
9YjXBYSAaa	Well, some people just don't take things like that seriously, and maybe that's all she's doing.  It could also possibly be that since the other girls aren't your friends and they don't like you very much she is feeling pressured to jump on the bandwagon and act as if she doesn't like you either.  Hopefully that's not the case but I would say just give it a little time and if she keeps backing off and not spending time with you then the best thing to do would just be to accept it.  It's unfortunate but if that's how she is going to be then there is nothing you can do.|`|8q4RhpZWaa	HAHAHHAHAHHAHAAHAH  HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH  AHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA  AHAHHAHAHAHAHHA  AHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAA|`|7laNYydNaa	ok I honestly DON'T care where they have me but for your situation..get her alone and talk to her,tell her how you feel about her having you last or sometimes not at all|`|SprMF8Lnaa	wtf...  tell me your joking.  heros? wow. lame.  your friends shouldnt be your heros, get a real role model.|`|2hF4zUE6aa	No i don`t care

Cheating is a symptom of a bigger problem.|`|HunSyQaSaa	take their clothes and see what happens while you are getting your camera.Then deal with the emotions.|`|gZMNQF4oaa	it depends.  leave him most definately.  if i was mad enough cut off his dick|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	break up with him probably.  & i'm really scared if i'm with  a cheater right now, so I basically  don't ever know what he's doing because  he lives far away from me.      ):|`|Am0xRpEjaa	dump him|`|K6gA2A0caa	i'll kill them both|`|K3FV1xZNaa	flip out. o.o and then dump their sorry ayss|`|UuNx2TR3aa	pimp slap her  and then beat the s h i t out of him|`|F8sYQsB5aa	If u really liked them, give em a second chance    if you've met better DUMP THE LOSER|`|O6TC4CgRaa	if i caught my man in bed with a girl, OMG...I WOULD GO CRAZYYYYY!!!!!

At first I would probably bounce between anger and sadness. But then when I calmed down, I would think about the reason he/she could be cheating. Did I hold up my end of the commitment. Did I give that person what they were looking for, when they decided to find it in someone else? Or am I just dating a pig? In the end, while cheating is the ultimate no no, if you are in an adult relationship then there are reasons why people cheat. I have been the cheater and the cheater. When I cheated, it was because I was obliviously looking for something that I wasn't getting from my partner, half the time I didn't even know that I was looking for it in someone else and the cheating sort of happened. When I got cheated on, I realized that I could be hot and cold to my lovers. I rejected affection a lot and while I am sure I was lover by this "cheater" I wasn't giving what my partner needed. I would never cheat again, and I do not condone cheating. But this is an opportunity to take a look at yourself and the person you're with. get some counseling. Or if you are just dating a jerk off then leave.|`|AA10941788	I would say ....SEE YA!!!!  Once a cheater always a cheater  The move on!!!!  Why be with someone who cheats on you?|`|pdBU1kNcaa	Break up with them and try to move on  once a cheater always a cheater and you cant ever take back what you do to hurt a person|`|zGi9Wag3aa	Stay with her for political reasons|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Break up with him, and kick him where it hurts.   Hey, I have to cause him some pain after all.|`|BkucBPwjaa	break up he would obviously not love me enough to not cheat|`|E9TqDn5maa	It depends on he details...but no one who is happy would risk it to be with someone else. I would see it as a serious betrayal. I would part ways with that person.|`|dKhOd0vtaa	i'd dump them right on the spot. The person your with  should care for you enough to only WANT to be with you and you only. IF there with somebody else then they don't care enough for me obviously. If that's the case then i dont need someone like that. If you were cheated on im really sorrry thats must stink. but theres better people in the world than a cheater. good luck hun!|`|2mla6m51aa	Ask them how was last night and if they lie smack them upside the head and run!|`|Dhaxcs6gaa	i would laugh while crying...cuz guys r so stupid|`|d6b9e60a9a066faf84377642d1aa2824aa	Forgive them & Forget them.|`|ibR6jJgHaa	Slap the dumbass  and be on my way!!  Never going to look back over my shoulder again, no seconed chances  I know I could do better?|`|8kpcRyCnaa	It depends on a lot of factors.  How long have you been seeing each other?  Had you already agreed on only seeing each other?  Either this can be a defining moment in your relationship or it can be the end.  If he was doing wrong and knew he was doing wrong, then the only way to continue on is to have punishment; now I'm not saying vindication or revenge, simply saying that for a healthy relationship to survive, the one who did wrong, must know that they did wrong and feel that their are consequences for doing wrong.    More than likely though, the best thing to do, is recognize your own value, see that you are worth more than being used, abused and taken Advantage of.  And politely and maturely part ways.  Who knows, he may grow up and meet you again some day.|`|qiLJlMWUaa	I would feel bad and wonder why did he cheat on me, and yes I would break up with him|`|emJ79qagaa	dump him|`|KZN5wzyRaa	it really depends on the situation as in....    who they cheated with??  did they just cheat once??  are they truly sorry??  how far did they go??  how i found out??  were they honest when i found out??    etc etc!!      no one can say once a cheater always a cheater because it depends on all the above and more everyone makes a mistake it just depends on if you love strong enough to deal with it!!    however if they  do decide to stay together take your time because it will take allot of work and allot of time to gain that trust again and some people cant at all!!    Aoife x.x.x|`|WcYRd9DLaa	id leave, but iwant to say cut it off!!!!|`|PdNJCcK3aa	LEAVE HIM/HER!! There is no excuse to cheat.. It's wrong and disgusting|`|91OtiijBaa	partner? i would prolly never trust her/him ever again.|`|0kWfGqQSaa	I would be heartbroken and run away crying. But then I'd sleep on it, and realize that I need to do something, and walk up to him and b!tch slap him so hard, his mom wouldn't even be able to recognize him!|`|awRjB9Axaa	I would stay very calm while I whacked them repeatedly with a wiffle ball bat then I would tell them to get the hell out of my house and that they could damn well expect a divorce filing and that they better get a good lawyer.|`|1RApUQM9aa	if i caught my partner cheating, i would be a little angry depending on what he did or what i saw him do because breaking up and not listening to their side of the story doesnt solve anything even if you think whatever they have to say isnt worth it. && if they came up with a retarded answer like "i didn't mean to", then i would definantly break up and move on with my life|`|0ec3ff8a6cac8b59459899dbb6e9852caa	Break up and walk away. Probably cry a little but you can't over react because if you use violence you run the risk of going to jail and paying a sentence for a worthless partner.
RzIiywZ6aa	Same thing happened to me.  We talked about it, agreed that we wouldnt let it get in the way of our friendship, and let the guy decide.  They've been together for about 6 months now and i'm perfectly fine with it, because I like seeing my friends happy.  So just talk about it and if your friendship is storng enough, one of you will be able to date him without breaking up your friendship|`|MEr99qKraa	FACE IT IF NE THING HAPPENS 1 OF U IS GOING TO GET HURT..NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT UNLESS 1 OF U STOPS LIKING HIM.....OR U CUD BOTH SHARE HIM ..THATS IT I'M AFRAID|`|AA10941788	A friendship is strong than being with a guy    I say both of you should forget about him. He isn't worth losing a friendship for|`|TKf6z1vHaa	The best way to really solve the problem and have no hurt feelings is to both of you give up on this guy and each look for someone else. The second option you would have is just try a date with him, each of you. See which one of you has the best chemistry with him and let that girl have him. Personally speaking as a girl, if me and my friend both like the same boy he's history because you do need your girlfriends and you may both be liking him because he's hot and you have no idea what his personality is like. Best of luck!|`|lEY4zGM7aa	See this is a tricky answer... The only way to solve it is you have to get another friend to go ask him i which one he likes more... I guess you know where Im going with this and then you got your answer just make sure he's not lying because the one he said is going to look like an idiot if they asked him out... The other friend he doesn't like just has to find the right one... But if one of you go out with him nd he's still flirtin with both of you dump him... Cuz he isn't right for any of you.  Goodluck:)

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Why Florida if she doesn't want a beach wedding?    Disney?  Key West?  A cruise ship?    All inclusives are in the Caribbean like Sandals, Beaches, Dreams and would just about definitely be a beach wedding though I'm sure you could do it like in a gazebo off the beach.    Otherwise just do it like everyone else.  Rent a reception hall in a city and a church.  Get married in the church and go to the hall for the reception.  Have a caterer.  St Pete or St Augustine would be nice.      If you don't live anywhere in Florida I'd hire a wedding planner to meet with vendors.  That way she can help you find a florist, a cake baker and all that so the bride won't be so stressed.|`|Unz3W0EEaa	check this out. they seem to have pretty good ideas.|`|YzpJxYBOaa	I don't know how close you are to Jacksonville, but there is a church there where she can have an absolutely FREE wedding AND reception.  Check out the details here:    http://www.freechurchweddings.com/    If I lived in or near Jacksonville and had a small budget, I would definitely look into this.    Now one catch, it would have to be on Valentine's Day.  Other than that - no catches, just a few requirements that are explained on the site.    Good luck!!

bO2rzfISaa	My husband has two daughters, 9 and 13. Any time there is a conflict between me and the children he backs me up 100% and he gives the children NO latitude to cause problems in our marriage. I have children of a similar age and I am well-experienced at dealing with the behavior of girls that age. He trusts me to do the right thing and be the adult in the situation. It is a great gift that he gives to me in our marriage.    Why are you CONFRONTING your wife about conflicts with the children? Don't you trust that your wife is able to conduct herself as an adult with your children?    Your children's complaints sound childish, maybe because they are children.|`|wpi36XBAaa	You should read JANSKY's question which is about nine below yours in this posting. It appears your wife has posted about this situation too.  "I am in constant defense to my husbands children from a previous marriage. should he put a stop to this?" JANSKY.  She says that your children falsely accuse her and you always take their side against her.   You say she freaks out every time you talk privately to her, about what the children have told you.   While you should "...respect my children and take their concerns into consideration and their feelings as well..." are you equally willing to offer your wife the same? Or do your children rate more highly than your new wife? Is that how SHE feels?  Perhaps you two should have set some boundaries in your lives together before you two got hitched? Its not too late to start an honest dialogue now.|`|sALtvyIvaa	Well what are your childs concerns? It matters what they are for me to answer, i mean it could just be that she clogs the toilet every night or that she hits your child.|`|AA11401294	find a different approach!|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	What are the kids complaining about    Sounds like she is having a hard time dealing with the fact that you have kids from a previous marriage? She should go to counseling.|`|x02jsjg6aa	Maybe it's the way you say it, in an almost accusation.  I generally think it's best to give the adult the benefit of the doubt even though the children are your blood- remember, they are not grown yet.  When you "confront" her you are acting as though your children are adults, and she is a kid who needs to be disciplined.  Grown women don't like to be treated like children.  Give her the benefit of the doubt, and ask her in a respectable way.    If your wife tells them to do their homework, they cry, and then you are angry at your wife for making them cry, you've just allowed children to run the house and belittled your wife.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Depends what their concerns are.  Are the valid?  If they are just causing trouble then she has a right to be annoyed.|`|AA11825142	Well how often is this happening? If this is a daily ritual then maybe she is freaking out for a good reason....Is it important things the kids are coming to you for or are they just being "kids"?  If its unimportant stuff keep it to yourself and tell the kids to respect your wife, you don't want her feeling like she isn't part of the family do you?  I have three children and am remarried and its hard bringing a new person into the picture for the kids... but its also hard on the new spouse trying to feel part of it you know? As long as you know your wife isn't out to get them.. which I am sure she isn't or you wouldn't have married her.|`|d92d9e4d19ffb819be90e8ef2b343f22aa	The blended family is a misnomer.  Your children seem not to trust in speaking with your new wife about their concerns.  However, 'confronting' your new wife about things that happen might also not be the way to deal with your new wife and how she handles conflict.    What you could need is a moderator an outside person, who you can all air your issues with.  You need to open a dialog with everyone present, and not be accusatory, be loving in your concerns with both your wife and the children.    Your new wife might feel the children are trying to cause issues with your marriage or is taking advantage of the situations.
lNGGCEYtaa	I'll do it, if you're too chicken! She sounds HOT!!!!!
AygQshkcaa	He's a player, so you shouldn't be worrying "what should I say to him at school?". If I were you, I would ignore him. He's not going to have any good future if he's busy flirting with girls. And he is a jerk! Jerks aren't worth it  By the way, players are liars. So he probably didn't mean that he just liked you for you. He actually meant "I'm going to wait 'till you open your heart to me so I can have sex with you".
	i know this sounds typical, but talk to her and tell her about it. When i was thirteen, my mom did the exact same thing. She would ground me if i gota c for a month. She just wants you to be prepared for the future, but is in consequence suffocating u. make a compromise with her. Tell her you'll study for ------------hrs per week, if u can do w/e. That way, you get some independency, while she is satifised you are keeping ur nose to the grindstone.|`|	HEY GUESS WHAT? SANTA CLAUS ISN'T REAL.|`|	How old are you?|`|	Have you tried talking to her about how you feel?   Or maybe going to a school counselor and talking about it will help.  If she's hitting you, you really need to take action. She needs to know that its not necessary.|`|	i understand totally where your coming from(except i dont make c's) but maybe your mom knows your potential and thinks you can do better! just sit down and talk to her calmy and you all can work this out!   Best Wishes|`|	My mother is like this, this may be diffiucult for you to understand, but she only wants the best for you and wants you to be the best you can be, try going to a youth club and explain to your mum that you can only be the best you can be if you have independence.|`|	how old are you anyway. just do what your mom says.|`|	Your Mom should never hit you. She seems to be far too strict, and it is inversely making you want to be more independent. It sounds like she needs some parental counseling. (But don't tell he that-- she doesn't want to hear it from you.) Maybe if there is someone else you can confide in within your family, they can direct your Mom. I know my Grandmother was always there for me when my Mom wasn't being a "good" parent.|`|	if shes abusive then turn her in! but if she isnt then the reason she is so hard on you is either because of personal experiences or she just wants you to suceed|`|	same here i get hit because i get B's or watever if not a perfect grade     im 13 i feel ur pain|`|	talk to your principal at school or a school counselor
b2c81caae4939ed512f305fd888babf0aa	im not in a similar situation but i dont know him or how things are between u and him so i'll give u both sides to the situation. bad first  1. he may be lying and is actually married to this woman he calls his ex and therefore keeping you a secret from them.  2. The fact that he's not with his "ex" who has kids for him may speak alot about him. as i said i dont know him. it may be for good reasons like she has aids or something and it may be that she's the one who doesnt want him but if she doesnt want him he wont have to worry about her being upset by you. so the fact that he's not with this woman shows that he's inappreciative of such wonderful aspects of life such as kids and that he has a problem with commitment. thats horrible. if he left her for you, thats even worse. so watch out about that.  3. I know that love blinds but remember that you have a child to care for too, you cant let your love for this guy affect you and him cause he depends on you. you being with him (as his "girlfriend") is not a good example for your child. You need a stable and uncomplicated home for your child. you need a husband who would care for you and your child as well, who isnt being childish and keeping secrets. If he loves you truly he'll marry you. if you give your self to him physically and he's not willing to marry you... i think you know the answer to that. just remember its not about just you anymore, your child is now involved  On the other hand,   1. he may be trying to protect you from the ex and his kids because they may be really mean and hurtful towards you but then again why would she be angry with him unless he broke up with her when she really needed him.i hope i helped
fEUFuEW2aa	No it isnt. She like her bf, and nt will happen between u two if u do. As long as the crush state doesnt grow, then u'll be fine. If it does, just hang out with her les,, but htere isnt anything wrong with ppl hanging out|`|VZOisk2saa	from what i think im reading is you like someone else girlfriend and want to go spend time with her without him  yeah i would say that is wrong  you should find someone who is single   ~pd|`|Ga2dMpB7aa	No, it's not wrong. Her boyfriend is too jealous, and he may not trust her around you, which either means she likes you more than you think she does or her boyfriend is massively paranoid. He's either going to have to get over it or find another girl.
9N6sW6KAaa	shutup good looking, well dressed fatty|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	i suppose that would be pretty fun, but there would have to be a good personality behind the laughter as well :)|`|7yrdcqY1aa	well if your always joking about yourself then i would worry about confidence and self esteem but if im getting the wrong impression then yeah im glad you can laugh at things.|`|SRd1UmcDaa	That seems like a lot of fun during teen years, but as adults, people who do things like that are seen as insecure.
19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Keep reporting his ex-wife and the other guy to CPS and to his chain of command.  Also if the baby she is carrying by the other guy was conceived while she was still married to your brother the other Marine can be charged w/ adultry.  Which is illegal under the UCMJ.  Tell your brother to get a lawyer and appeal the custody decision.  Also he needs to get a family care plan in order.  Do what ever he has to prove her an unfit mother and show that even w/ his military career he is the better parent.  Obviously the first judge was an unpatriotic bias bastard.  He also needs to get into counseling to help deal w/ the trama of being over there.  I hate stupid b-tch wives who can't keep there pants on when their soldier is deployed.  The other marine is an embarrasment to the military.  Tell him that this Army wife says not to give up.  Good Luck.|`|Jugy7mH0aa	Unfortunately, this is the way it usually goes with a spouse in the military, due to the fact that Marines/Soldiers/etc are more likely to deploy and leave their kids. I would have your brother go back to the courts and try to fight to have them back - sole physical custody. Right now he should set up a rock solid Family Care Plan (that's what the army calls a plan incase of deployment - someone to provide for kids), and try to show that the child will be well taken care of in case of future deployments. Also, call CPS again. If your brother sees the children occasionaly he should inspect the children for rashes, bruises and such, as soon as he gets them and take pictures and take notes of possible abuse. Take these to CPS and show them if there is enough an investigation should follow!    Good luck. No one deserves this!|`|AA10941788	If I were him I would fight for the kids again. That is flat out wrong. I feel very sorry for your brother    Lord be with him
5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	first real love or not, as you get older you will find lifes to short to be with a person that does not make you happy. forget the so called connection and move on with someone you will be happy with, regardless of what you both do and say its not worth the aggravation.hitting is never good and that will get worse and if he has so much funnnnnn with his so called friends let him hang with them while you go find someone else to have fun with.|`|AA11558033	if he hangs out with his friends.... so should u.... call up your friends and hang out with them. guys usually need their space|`|SRd1UmcDaa	Take a break from each other. Absence makes the tart, I mean heart grow fonder.|`|KYoJ7wiiaa	If he treats you like this then maybe he doesn't care about you the same way you care about him. It may be hard to come to terms with but it's better to leave than to stay in a relationship with nonstop fighting. It's not good for your mental well-being to stay in a relationship like that. It is hard to leave someone you really care about but in the long run its better than letting the arguements and fights continue. If it's physical now in terms with hitting it will only  get worse trust me. And at one point he may get too physical and hurt you, even though he may not want that. And if he would rather spend time with his friends than you, then is he really in a relationship to be with you or to just "get" with you??
7kJFmyxdaa	Supervised visitation is where someone else is in the room with you at all times. If the court grants him visitations then yes you can be there but someone else will be with you in the room the whole time. They will not leave and there will be rules and guidelines you must follow. I would not get my hopes up with visitation being granted if indeed the person you are wanting to visit with a newborn is in jail for raping a three year old child.    Hope this helps.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Why'd you have a baby with a pedophile?|`|44mmJ14Caa	IF HE WENT TO PRISON FOR THAT SICK **** THEN THEY WONT GIVE HIM VISITATION AT ALL I WOULDN'T THINK BUT NO HE WONT BE ALLOWED TO BE ALONE WITH HER

ViFCEb7Paa	I would say "Mr or Mr. & Mrs." I don't think it would be "Firefighter Joe", only because when addressing someone you don't normally mention them by their job title, for example "Soldier Tom". There are some exceptions like "Dr. So So" or "Judge Judy".|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.

AA10916001	Do not....I repeat DO NOT get into a relationship with anyone you work with ever, ever, ever, ever, again.      That being said: She is trying to tell you she does NOT want to go out with you and she is trying to do it in a way that will let you down easy. She wants to see other people.      Take the high road and  be a gentleman...just let it go and try to be an adult about it.      Since the two of you insisted on being a couple even though you work together, you now have to be a responsible EMPLOYEE and not let it effect your work.    If you cannot do that, you need to find another place of employment.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Were you guys every even dating?  If not, then maybe u guys shouldn't have had sex.  She sounds really slutty too.  Idk, tell her to let down her guard and give u a chance.  Tell her that u love her and that she means so much to u (if that's true, which I'm assuming it is).  Tell her to wait, and see if things work out, and if they don't, then they don't.|`|AA10531094	She's either unstable or is waiting for someone else or both.    I can't stand people who don't know what they want from the beginning but pursue you anyway.  Forget her and move on. Good Luck!|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	It's over.

There isn't really much you can do.  When you see her be nice but not overbearing so she's not afraid to be friends with you.  Be her friend and maybe she'll get over her little panic and decide she wants you again, but don't sit around waiting for her.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Move on, she has. When it's over it's over.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	she probs has someone else shes gonig out with too|`|1Sdacs28aa	Sorry to hear about your situation.    I can see two reasons she is avoiding you:  1] You guys had sex. She has conquered the Promised Land and no longer has any desire to have anything to do with you. I know this behavior is more common in men but women do it too.  2] She really is scared and feeling rushed about the relationship and is trying to let you down gently by saying you deserve someone better.    Since she is pretty much avoiding you, that means basically that she doesn't want to see you anymore. Girls don't usually avoid someone unless we absolutely don't want to see them at all. If she still wanted to be with you, she would be trying hard to talk with you and figure out what's going on.    The fact that she's saying she's scared and that you deserve someone better pretty much cements it that she doesn't want to see you anymore and is trying to be nice about it.    Sorry to say but I think this relationship is a no-go. Take it as a life lesson and move on. I hope you find a new love and good luck. ^_^|`|01GbQLZwaa	sounds like she doesn't want to put the effort into a new relationship that could be long term. Also kind of sounds like she is sleeping around with a few guys and probably doing the same thing to them. Stay away from this girl bc it sound truly screwed up.|`|5YUhFzJ6aa	come on man you had fun thats all.now shes not interested in you thats all or she is bored.|`|rNi5MGtoaa	get to know her more.      she will begin to like u more.....      and then u will get some thing rewarding from her wen she is in love with u|`|GUq7IozLaa	Wow :/  She is being completely slutty.|`|9mpqViXSaa	I would get rid of her. Find someone else. Because obvisouly she is cheating on you.|`|pLZiKPFgaa	Shes scared of getting into anything serious maybe because she just got out of a bad relationship. be nice talk to if you can if not dont let it show that it bothers you. just let her know that if she needs a friend you'll be there for here.|`|5wARwhe9aa	It sounds like she isn't ready to commit by her yours and 'only' yours comment. Or that she is worried about being unfaithful.    I'd do a little test to see if she'd answer her phone. Either have a friend call or block your number just to see if she picks up to satisfy your own curiosity.. then you have a reason to be pissed [lies].    I think it's pretty lame she'd pull the hit it and quit it number. It could be that she feels like she got too close and needs to pull out. You either have to break through that (assuming that's the issue) or move on to someone who isn't going to come with emotional baggage.    Good luck, either way you go! :[|`|AA10929980	forget about it all. There could be someone new or she could really be scared of something new.   but honestly, by her saying "thinks i deserve a better girl that will be mine and only mine, and she thinks im truly special" it sounds like she is into someone else so forget about her. there are sooo many other girls out there. move on. I mean listen to what she said 'you deserve a better girl that will be yours and only yours'. that sounds like she isn't only yours she is with somebody else too.|`|Wt62GmgRaa	she pretty much used you! Avoid her, she isn't interested in you. think about, when have you ever heard a women say, "you deserve a better girl" the only time a guy hear's that is when they break up with you!!! If she really meant what she said, than she wouldn't avoid you, she would just understand and move on...   This is just my opinion so don't take what i think seriously however i highly recommend talking to her face to face!|`|4ecab2e64798528994aaade6190980e0aa	Why don't you try send her a Flower, Given a note with her, tell her to meet you somewhere, and talk. See if she just wanted to be friends. She needs to tell you if she don't want to be with you, But atleast she can't say you didn't came back for her.     You know that thing, Women goes away, but want a men go after her. Do something Romoa sweet, not just sex.|`|hGUUeXLhaa	move on.she isnt into u any longer.  hey my sis is a chic.  blue eyes,brown hair,a body shaped like an fashion model.  everything u might like.  and she is not dating anyone.
afcLu9YMaa	Yes it will and he can get his name on the birth certificate as his father, get access and you can get maintenance. Unless he is a good father, who pays for his son, attends regular access, then he will have little automatic rights and will have to get your agreement or fight through the court.   You are your sons primary carer and the fact he disputes paternity and doesn't pay for his numerous other children i don't think you need to worry......................something tells me he won't bother seeing him nor pay and fight in court for rights.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	If the test comes back 99.9% positive then he will have rights.  But he'd have to take you to court to FORCE you to allow visitation and he's not going to do that because it costs money!  What makes you think he will step forward for this baby and not the others?  I know. Because it's yours.  Rest easy Mom, he's got a track record that lets you know he won't bother the two of you.  The thought of paying child support will scare the crap out of him.  Good Luck|`|5HqZkJixaa	Yes.  And let it be a lesson to be choosy with whom you lay down, he just may father your child!|`|JUEkTETAaa	yes he does UNLESS u can prove that he should not hav right of him|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Probably, but as he has never bothered his *** with his other children l would'nt worry about it. My childrens father was the same, except to my knowledge he only had them with me. I raised them with some brilliant male role models, as well as some not so brilliant (life ain't perfect) and they are great young adults now, l'm proud of all 3 of them.
B95XLZSWaa	Personally I'd be more concerned with the fact that she's recently divorced.  Alot of excess baggage comes with divorce.  Even the strongest of women can find themselves struggling mentally and emotionally after getting divorced.  Most experts say that a person shouldn't date for approximately one year after the divorce was finalized.  From my own personal experience I'd say 9 months at the very least.|`|40xAVBblaa	just keep it professional at work   i'd try it out an see what happens   true love comes when you least expect it|`|oH2a7Fnsaa	nothing wrong, but, keep it discreet, and be a thorough professional at work.    Many people have found love at the work place. So, you could be the lucky one too.
AAQrhKg6aa	i know how you feel one of the same things happened to me before you just need to make sure you feel comfortable enough with him before you go any farther with him the more comfortable you feel the more better of a time you will have with hime... remember your still very young and you have all the time in the world so don't feel like you have to do something or feel rushed to do it .. everything comes in its own time no need to rush it|`|oWd9YGM5aa	just tell him how you feel and tell him to go easy on you|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Please be very careful.    It wouldn't take much for those your age to get caught up in emotions and hormones and go further than "making out" (what ever that means this year).    You have many years ahead of you before you marry.  Don't jeopardize what will be a great relationship in a few years with what seems to feel good today.    Stop and think:  if things start to get beyond where you want to go, how will you stop it?  If you become pregnant, who will support you and your child.  Your parents have raised their kids; it's not right to expect them to raise one of yours, is it?    In short, it isn't fair to you , your parents, or your future husband to be fooling around with the "boyfriend".    There are other ways for you two to show your feelings for each other.|`|fhH1sqkcaa	Maybe you should take it slow  or just move up to that level  maybe ask him to  practice making out  so you wont be as nervous|`|pLZiKPFgaa	just tell him you want to but please tell him to take it slow
GHgptLAsaa	Girl, you dont deserve that! A relationship is when two people are in love and get along well not insulting each other! I know yall have been together for a while and you dont wanna think about moving on but I think thats truly what you need!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	If he don't care about you than he don't like you. Just DUMB HIM ASAP! You can find someone who cares!!!!|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	i think he's an ***!|`|HCWkdk4naa	you are a manipulative brat.  stop trying to suck this guy into your problems.  the only man you should be seeing is a psychiatrist.  if you are cutting, get off of y!a and seek help, please.|`|x6TEqf1yaa	this really doesnt sound like a healthy relationship at all.  I thinkk you should find a better guy near you that can be with you when you feel so bad. Your bf cant hold you or physically, and it doesnt even sound like he really wants to.  try to find a good guy that is near you, so you can be with him, and so he can physically help you when you need it.       good luck!
8tJPK69iaa	If she files for divorce she'll get less money than you are giving her now.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	This is what they call a 'circle jerk'.  I think your wife is manipulating the system...and you.  If she filed for divorce, it would be mandatory that a 'fair and equitable' agreement be made between the two of you.   Basically...she wouldn't be able to call the shots anymore.  You said yourself that when the money train stopped running, she changed.  Up until then, she was violating her own restraining order as long as it suited her.      Let this go.  First of all...stop shelling out all this money and make her file a court order...trust me...she doesn't want to do this because she KNOWS she's getting something for nothing right now...and the court will be far less generous to her than you're being.  Secondly...beat her at her own game, and file for divorce YOURSELF.  This is no marriage anyway...it's just a succession of mind games and bullying.  Maintain your sobriety for YOURSELF and YOUR life...not HER.|`|rH33ty23aa	I think that you did a wrong thing when you hit her, but if your honest in everything you wrote i think you have tried very hard to show her how stupid it was and to work on this marriage. Shes using you, if she files for a divorce then she will either have to get a job or work more hours. Maybe she cant support herself withour that $400 a week. I think that you need to tell her we work this out seriously or im filing a divorce, i wouldnt give her any more money either.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	That's too bad that the situation is still escalating. I feel she's hanging onto you because you are helping her out financially. She wants the money without you being around. I think you should file for the divorce. It's apparently over and as long as she continues to say the things she is about you, your life will continually be in turmoil. You need to stay strong in your rehabilitation and go forward. Stay away from her and do legally what you should do. Good luck to you and I wish you a better life.|`|g0j5Vstgaa	Look, it happened, you're getting help, you're on your way...she's going to accept your money and pray on your guilt for as long as you let her.  She wasn't there for you when you lost your job-we've all been there lately.  Sounds like you two need to go to a councilor and work this out, or you file for divorce.  She's going to keep spending your hard earned money.  You can recreate yourself in your community. Go to a different mass schedule, or another church.  Get your life together and  stop letting her remind you of your mistakes. She sounds like she is seriously pulling you down.  That way you'll always be a disappointment like she's used to.  $400 a week is very high-I'd let the courts, based on your income now, pick a fair amount.  And no offense, but that's a really dumb reason to hit a woman.  Any reason would be.  Glad you're changing for the better.
xZOHlSXsaa	He may simply not realise that it is annoying you.     His excuse of having no more minutes is fair enough - maybe msn will do? I know that the fact he's meant to be your boyfriend and he's texting other girls is annoying you - does he know?     I wouldn't beat him up about it but let him know that you're a bit "insert word here" about him doing that.    If he won't listen and/or stop then it might not be worth sticking with him.    If he listens and keeps that to a minimum then that's great!    I think you're right with the "go with the flow" stuff. It's much more sensible as it 1. will feel better at the time and 2. He has no right what so ever to kiss you if you don't want him to.    If you're getting the feeling that he doesn't care about you then make sure he knows how you feel and see if he changes.     If he makes an effort then he's obviously still interested and you should let it be but if he ignores you on something as important as this then... well it's your choice whether you stay or not but it sounds like he's wasting your time.    Hope this helps=)|`|hKlApSxAaa	You could always tell him that the fire extinguisher gives you more attention. He could help you to punctuate, he could introduce you to the poetry of William Carlos Williams. You could buy a scratched Spacemen 3 album from a car boot sale on a dreary February Sunday morning, mud all over your trainers and the hems of your jeans.

It would be much worse if you wanted to call him that and he didn't.  You can say his nickname in playful manners... Such as when you want to catch his attention...|`|R5d4cGATaa	Call him by his real name.  He secretly likes it.  You are special for being the only one that calls him by his real name.|`|FBvfX4Lwaa	i think you should see what he likes, and call him that. or you could always call him both every now and then.|`|VcTTSUI7aa	I would just tell him that you like calling him by his real name because it is different what everyone else calls him.|`|pz3LaTITaa	for me.. no.. just do as he want this is for your relationship..

There also seems to be quite a few women who think the whole idea is a turn off. If you want your man to wear panties you could get him a pair you like (either one of yours or a pair you bought just for him) and tell him how sexy you think it would be if he wore them for you.

You can try dating sites, but be very careful, it is full of scammers.  Good luck.|`|RCJqaWQYaa	Sorry, to hear that.  Get, a babysitter or a close friend to babysit for you.  Socialise.  Go out!

4b05658f9b80d400cfc53e2ea5ecf209aa	That is a long way to travel and it sounds like you are, currently, busted.  RSVP and send your regrets.....tell him that you simply can't swing it.    But do make sure you remember the baby before or when he/she is born.  Sounds like this cousin and you are close and it is good etiquette to send a gift!|`|jdVxsK4yaa	u should go..it is family  how would u feel if thy didnt show up??|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Just tell him the truth that is all that matters.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	I wouldn't.|`|yXbazL5iaa	go, and explain your situation about not getting anything for them

rywgn8HLaa	I can understand why you would be upset with him for not telling you about the call, but it seems to me like he just wanted to make peace and get closure with the whole situation. It was probably something that had been bothering him for a while. Maybe he had the reaction that he did because he felt ashamed about the past and just didn't want to talk about it anymore. I wouldn't be to angry with him though - unless he calls her again I would just take it as him closing the door to his past. No worries...|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Why would she suddenly feel the need to tell him now? why has she still got contact & knows your number? Was there any point in making him feel bad & need to ring back to apologize at this late stage?  It is your business, you are a team  & should work things out together, I would feel the same as you, it is a natural reaction that any woman would feel. Try to get over it & heal the rift between you.|`|8tJPK69iaa	He now has closure, let it be.|`|cdQryr7paa	He just called her to apologize.  It's not like he is going to get back together with her.  Do you inform him of all your phone calls and who they are to?  Does he know EVERYTHING about you and your past?  Just drop it, it's over, move on.  There are plenty of other things in a marriage to worry about.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	he should have let you answer and that would have been enough to deal with it she would know he has a woman and you would know he loves you|`|W1MgefrWaa	You have the right to be mad but move on.  Yeah him calling without asking u if he could first, may have not been wise. But sometimes it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.   Move on, unless u want to drive him to her.|`|024Pu2XRaa	If you are married, then things like this are YOUR BUSINESS. You have every right to be mad.|`|mKCiofUFaa	No, you are not in the wrong. However, it would be good to hear that he is making peace with his past. For if he didn't, he would feel guilty and bad and cannot be completely present with you either.     The best way to deal with this is to love him no matter what and be understanding. If it is too hard for you, then you need to understand, pushing the issue will only push him away from you to her.    Good luck! Marriages or relationships are tough. I understand.|`|WokwBBGIaa	thats bang out of order on his part and i suggest you nip it now. its will fastly become out of control and may turn in to a emotional affair I went though the EXACT same thing during christmas. im so sorry for you. you need to tell him that it hurts your feeling and if he says it doesnt matter then leave him. becuase this is only what to expect from him the the future|`|AA11678629	YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE MAD.

85tAhnM9aa	Unless you really want to go back to him I wouldn't. It sounds like he may be using you and could hurt you again.|`|ina2jZ5Saa	the only thing to do now is wait....don't throw yourself at him. Perhaps you should try to stop talking to him, stop texting him or whatever...and see if he comes back to you. if he does, it means he has feelings for you. if he doesn't, then you know he is using you...but the fact that he sent you an ecard and remembered your b-day means that you were on his mind. The saying holds true..."if its love, let it go, if its true love, it'll come right back." if he shows feelings for you, then go for it. Also, if you really want to just end this, discuss how you feel with him so you'll know once and for all where he stands.   good luck hun =)

Good luck and have fun!|`|losGznxMaa	DOnt try to pop them with your nails. If you feel the urge to destroy them, use a sterile needle (use rubbing alchehol or hot water to do this) or, if your face scabs easy after popping them, dont pop them, it'll only make the makeup clump. When covering them up, dont pile on the coverup b/c it'll draw a bunch of attention to the area. Just dab it on a little at a time. You may even want to mix in lotion (with the liquid coverup) to make it more thin. BUt if all else fails, remember everyone has zits, and it wont matter in a few days... good luck! :)|`|XfXRFCtcaa	for the future use dove soap.    yeah, use cover up|`|VFhcCZgFaa	back in the days theres this hot *** looking mexican girl with pretty much acne.... but she wears makeup but it is noticible that her acne is visible.     i try to hit on her.... but jus talk with few words...... shes in the field during fitness hour.    boys dont care if girls have acne. jus care if they hot. if u really want to get rid of acne.... dont mess with it by pinchhing it itll get worse. jus wash your face with speciallize acne control soup like clearsell. wash face every often with it.|`|QuokZhuqaa	Well it's only two zits so I wouldn't worry I mean you can probably cover them up with some makeup but I suggest to clean your face first, and put on a cream with benzoyl peroxide to treat your zits, then if that doesn't work try so tea tree oil to treat it. Then cover the zits with a bit of conceler then blend it out with some foundation.    (:     good luckk!!|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	Omg, it's just ance, and only 2. Well use powder or shade powder to make it fade. And trust me, he won't break up with you just because of those ance, you r beautiful how u beautiful, or u can watch this vid if need to|`|K32Kpbjeaa	wow. fake preppy *****.   He's not going to care if you have TWO ******* zits on your face, two is NOt breaking out, if you saw me you would puke then. I have facial acne. Grow up.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	This has always worked for me: pop them, wash them, then cover them with toothpaste for ten minutes. They'll dry right up.|`|lmG4qKDyaa	put toothpaste on them until its time to hang out with him, the toothpaste dries it out  then use cover upppp !|`|uV9Jvbr8aa	Clean and Clear Morning Burst works super fast. I use the green kind, but I'm sure they all work.|`|Dl1uS5CLaa	oh i hate when that happens   ok well you SCRUB. but not to much.  then after put some ice so it doesn't look REALLY red.  then if u have any green make up put a TINY bit of that on it because it suppose to cancel it out but if u dont skip that.  but a lighter tone on it then blend with regular foundation  hope i helped :)|`|tjEG8dxwaa	I would use coverup. the same thing happend to me and thats what I had to do.|`|W8RqiKbVaa	well nothing can cure acne right away so for make up tips dont rub in ur cover up.  (make sure its your color though)  Just pat on the cover up until its not noticeable.  if it still is and they are on your forhead and you just happen to have side bangs let them falll down and hide them in ur hair.  (that sounds weird but it works most of the time)    good luck with ur "date" oh and what ever you do do not pop them!    hope i could hep a bit. just try it. ?|`|FjTEI1Dhaa	Coverup, use your skin color. if you don't have coverup then try to distract the zits with mascara or blush,or eyeshadow, but not a lot. Any coverup will work though|`|ZpEEwzZCaa	okay. well don't scratch or rub the zits. they will just become more noticable. you can put some concealer over them. but if you would like more coverage, try this: first, put some face primer on. then, put foundation and concealer on. putting foundation directly over zits makes them more noticable. the primer will help conceal them better. if you do not own these products, dont sweat it. the guy probably wont care or even notice them. hope i helped! (:|`|G7fqgUo3aa	Definitely stop squeezing it. Clean it good, but don't apply too much pressure (don't make it more red). I've always read that you need to apply a dab of toothpaste to the pimple. Then leave it. Normally people put it on overnite, Put it on now and leave it til you need to get ready. Ice can help with redness or puffiness, if you've squeezed it. Moisturize once you remove the toothpaste. Put a dab of concealer on the pimple, let it dry a little, before you put your foundation...this way it won't just smudge off while rubbing your foundation on. You will probably want to add a touch of concealer to the pimple after foundation. Then add your powder to seal it all in.|`|O6nXUnx2aa	For makeup I would use coverup or a concealer stick  I heard that if you put toothpaste on them the redness will go away and they will shrink.   I found some sites that might help:  http://www.grannymed.com/meds/acne.aspx    http://www.ayurvediccure.com/homeremedie...|`|YPsIljtQaa	okay, you could try Neutrogena's new Rapid Clear Fight & Fade 2-in-1Gel. It usually works pretty fast for me. You're are supposed to see a difference in 8 hours. I doubt that will remove the pimple entirely. Try some Maybelline Mineral Concealer. Its light so that it doesn't clog your pores, but covers your spot. You don't have to use a lot to see a difference. Put a on a really cute lip gloss, and smile a lot. He'll be so focused on your smile and lips, they he'll probably go for a kiss and forget those punk zits. Have fun tonight!
4YpllKR2aa	I know exactly what you are saying, that is actually how i found your question, I was trying to find an answer to the same question. So far what i have found is to just be the upper hand while you are fighting. So like act as if you were the parent. Be the on to stay calm and when they are done say something to the effect that "I will not listen to you when you are being immature and shouting at me, I'll talk to you later when you have calmed down". This would be the best option if you don't what to to be able to get in trouble. They can't punish you for being calm and not shouting, can they? This way i think will work the best. I have also found out that you can just do what you're told but over. This will make them pissed because they can't repay you. This seems like too much work for my taste though so i suggest doing the first way listed.    One way i have also found though is that some times it is better to just get on the computer and clear your head and not think about your own problems, but to think about others. Maybe come on the computer and answer some of the questions on here. That often clears my head and then I try to just forget about it. This isn't my favorite way of cheering myself up. I still prefer pissing my parents off more.    Ultimately for the most self satisfaction, act like the bigger person. Technically you aren't being the bigger person since you are doing it to upset the bitche(s)/bastard(s) but I think it is the best way of describing it.    Happy Upsetting your parents!!!
StJGeiFyaa	my bf always told me that watching me do housework was hot lol|`|PqfDgJubaa	Every guy is different so some guys will find something sexy that another guy wont. Personally i think it is sexy when girls wear very little make-up and you can actually see their natural beauty (mascara and lip gloss is sexy though!). It is sexy when a girl touchs your hand/arm when talking to you too. Also for every guy there is a particular part of the female body that they are really into e.g. breasts, ***, legs etc. I am an ***-man! If you think any of these features look particularly good then show them off e.g. if you have a nice *** wear tight jeans, if you have nice legs wear a skirt. Believe me if you show it off guys will notice. dont show too much though, guys like a bit of mystery.
AA11319441	The irs doesn't get involved with any of this.  Their stance is "First one in, wins."   You need to get something on paper to change this.  Although he can be audited for past exemptions and tax years and he would have to show why he claimed the child.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	First of all find out if you have been missing out on a tax credit by not claiming this yourself. Second, you need to make him aware that he is doing something illegal since this could be just a lack of knowledge and he can report the mistake without getting into trouble. If you have known about this, and it was laid out in the parenting plan, why now are you thinking of getting him in trouble? If it isn't signed he has probably assumed you consented. Why don't you? Think to yourself, "Okay he annoys me, but will it be in my children's best interest if I create a situation over something that was assumed? Am I doing this to hurt my ex,, the father of my children?" Always, for the sake of the children, be a good role model and communicate with politeness and good intent.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	talk to an attorney about this parenting plan that says he can claim the child and see if it is valid.  If it is then he can claim the child, if it isn't then you can claim the child and report him to the IRS for fraud.    but get it sorted out so you know what is right because eventually it will catch up with you and both of you will be audited and the one in the wrong will have to pay.  You want to make sure you aren't in the wrong.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	You need to file in family court to have a court order that directly states you can claim the  children on your tax return, if he would do it after that, he would get into trouble with the IRS. It is the only way to settle this issue because people do this kind of thing all the time, without any legal documentation otherwise, nothing will get done on your behalf.|`|OQsj0Am3aa	Be truthful in your return.  If it comes back to haunt you put them right onto him for lying.
AA11826328	This is really confusing for me to follow but, I will try to stay on track here okay...  Okay first of all there is no such thing as being over someone right away just because you are not with as girlfriend/boyfriend the heart wants who the heart wants at times and sometimes the heart wants what/who it can't have but, in order to save a friendship sometimes you have to give it time you are still young and still finding yourself so it's going to be hard but you will get over him and maybe still save the friendship....good luck   Lil Angel|`|0HnMe6p4aa	Just tell your bestfriend how you feel about him. Maybe, just maybe, he can feel the same way. But if he doesnt, then atleast he KNOWS how you feel. And obviously, he cares for you. How he never screwed you over or never stopped being his friend.    (:
AA12260828	It may be that she's got other things on her mind and she's just too stressed, or it may be a sign that she's pulling away from you. Have you asked her why?    If she's a little vague with her reason or gets angry she may be pulling away from you for some reason. Be understanding and calm to get to the heart of the matter. Maybe she's suddenly self-conscious for some reason.|`|M63kq3AYaa	It is if you ask a reason and she doesn't give a real reason or gets angry that you asked.|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Maybe she's on her period?  Maybe you did something to make her un-happy?  Whatever it is, talk to her about it, and ask her whatsup. If she usually is willing to have sex, and she has suddenly changed then this is something you should be concerned about.

QhgvziIRaa	First, you are going to want to ask yourself four vital questions. These are really important questions when it comes to figuring out how to get your ex boyfriend back.    - Is the matter that caused the breakup actually important enough to warrant the attention it is getting?    - Is it even really appropriate to argue about this matter right now?    - Can anything be changed or made different by prevailing in the argument or is it more worthwhile to just nip the argument in the bud and move on?    - Is the issue even worth arguing about in the first place?    If you answer no to any of the aforementioned questions, then stop pressing the matter and let it slide. Many break ups can be prevented or quickly rekindled if a large argument is settled. Surprisingly enough, many breakup inducing argument are really completely unnecessary, and could be cast aside if only the parties involved could let the tension slide and move on.    The next step to learning how to get your ex boyfriend back is to stop fretting so hard about how you are being perceived. It really does not matter if people think you are funny or too serious, fat or too thin, stupid or intelligent. You want to let go on these concerns so that you can finally be yourself and let your behavior flow. This way, people like your ex boyfriend will perceive you for who you actually are, rather than who you are trying to be.    Emotionally and mentally distancing yourself from your ex is an important step in learning how to get your ex boyfriend back. While this may seem counterintuitive, it is actually important to take yourself out of the situation mentally, removing the stress associated with the break up. When you are feeling more calmed and relaxed, and he is feeling the same, this is when true resolution can finally become a part of the dialogue between the two of you. A little bit of distance never hurt anyone. It's important to stay in contact and maintain positive conversation and communication, but take the emotions out of the situation if you want to survive the conversation.     Once your head is clear, and his head is clear, this is when the situation can be truly analyzed for what it is. When you and your ex are no longer feeling so hot headed about the issue that led to the breakup, this is when you can sit down together and communicate through a solution.     Most breakups can be easily undone if you and your ex boyfriend can simply find the patience and civility to talk things through, so this should be your primary goal if you want to rekindle the flame with an ex significant other that you care significantly for.|`|JNUWzHGzaa	Okay iv been there done that and i still kinda like my ex now. DO NOT tell him u want him back and loadsa mushy stuff, he will just get annoyed.  Leave him alone for a bit, and then he will end up missing you because ur not in his life. But for this to work, you need to not be in his life for a while, if he asks u to come out or meet him or watever jus say ur busy. Not every time because he is a boy and he will take it the wrong way, just enough times to make him wonder what your busy doing and who your busy with? And if he really likes you HE WILL come back. Its like a proven fact. x|`|AA10721433	u cant force anyone to love you back the way you do.|`|8njrMiwYaa	Well tell him how you feel, and tell him you Do Care about him|`|jazKtgENaa	I'm in the situation as you.....if only I knew|`|4oBCEkheaa	Flirt till u drop! lol|`|qwVruoJ8aa	And why would you want to go back to him things never meet to be|`|59GGw0WAaa	Chop off your fingers and send one at a time until he gives in.

Act busy and restrict time with him.  The last thing you want to do is beg and plead for him to come back to you - it just makes you seem desperate and obsessive.    This is the hardest thing to do, and I know, I have been there, but, eventually he may come back to you.  If he Truly likes you he will come crawling back.    Hang in there and be strong.|`|uxUV7B5jaa	ignore him, guys want what they can't have|`|W3nCHPUtaa	whoa you have some drama in your life. but you kinda have to face the truth. If he doesnt have the same feelings for you, maybe you guys wouldnt be the best together. I suggest to look for someone else.He broke up with you and i wouldn't try to get him back.|`|UtwMxaPzaa	sweetie, if he broke up with you, there's nothing you can do. He knows you love him, but he broke up with you anyway. You can TRY to remind him why he fell in love with you in the first place. But, indirectly. Don't talk to him, just make sure he sees you. But if nothing changes within, say, a month, you MUST move on.|`|c7ZSVByfaa	firstly y would you want him back??and secondly door mat comes to mind.|`|Ga5MIkzRaa	Dont if he wonts to be an *** you dont need him|`|FU07SiQEaa	ACT ACT ACT like your letting go, and TRUST ME if he really loves or likes you HE WILL COME BACK!!!!!    If he doesnt, then its not meant to be.     But trust me, hes not going to go back to you if he sees how desprate you are and hes going to see he has you wrapped around his finger.    Dont call or text him, act like you dont see him  and FLIRT!!!!!!     If  he texts you, take long to text back or dont text back at all.  If he calls you, miss a call and call him back....|`|l3UZMwOcaa	if he thinks you don't care, ignoring him WONT WORK. those other idiots who have answered your question already don't ******* know. you must regain his trust. show him how you care.

6iUvbQDOaa	I worked (for 2 years) at a privately owned jewelry store and we were never like "sharks" towards our customers.  Sadly, I moved to a different city and got a job at a "chain" jewelry store (for 3 weeks...i quit because the company wanted me to lie to customers about the quality of their jewelry and I was told by my boss "Do what you have to do, and say whatever you have to say, to get people to buy, buy, buy"). I'm not saying that all jewelry stores in the mall or "chain" jewelry stores are bad; but understand that the employees have to meet their "numbers" every week and the managers typically are not GIA, EGL, or IGA certified. If you want to purchase a quality piece and get your $'s worth, then you need to buy from a store where its employees, or managers, are GIA, EGL, and/or IGA certified.     Engagement/Bridal jewelry should have its own section in the store. First, you need to know if your girlfriend prefers yellow gold, white gold, or platinum. (Here's a secret... platinum really isn't all that great...and it's gonna cost you a lot more $$$ now and in the end.) Platinum pits very easily, and it also is prone to getting a patina on it. A patina on platinum is like tarnish on silver. Once it gets a patina, the only way to bring back its luster is to re-rhodium the entire piece (which you will have to do 4 or more times per year and it will cost you $$$). Rhodium is a liquid metal that only adheres to metal. All white gold pieces and platinum pieces have a rhodium finish on them (it's what gives the pieces that "shiny white" look.) White gold pieces only need to be re-rhodiumed about once every 3 years.    Once you've decided on the metal, you need to decide on a cut (round, princess, emerald, oval, pear, marquee, radiant, heart, trillian). The round and the radiant cuts have the most facets. A round is a circle and a radiant is a square/rectangle with cushiond points. A princess is a square cut stone with a lot of facets. An emerald cut is a rectangle w/ the LEAST amount of facets. A pear is shaped like a tear drop and a marquee is shaped like a surf board. A trillian is a triangle, and hopefully you know what an oval and a heart look like.    Next comes clarity and color. Without me going into MAJOR details, just know this: don't go lower then an "H" in color or a "SI-1" in clarity.  The stores you go to should have loose stones for you to look at, and the employees "favorite" vendor catalogs. The employees should educate you on every aspect of cut, color, clarity, metal, cost, settings, carat weight/measurements, mountings, etc. because so far, the only thing I've covered...is the center stone...good luck...|`|MdhRRPHjaa	you can buy online  1.Select your alternative  2.Compare price  3.How there ship  4.Their testimonial  5. check their warranty  6.any optional..|`|4lL34wJnaa	I would HIGHLY suggest doing your research before shopping a jewelry store!    My fiance told me his horror stories of finding my amazing ring.  He went to many shops all over New England and had salespeople at a few different shops tell him that it was "ok to buy a low quality diamond because she'd never know the difference..."  I thought that was TERRIBLE!  I am pretty sure these jewelry salespeople just wanted a sale.  My fiance knew I had done my research and he knew I knew the difference (it's all in the sparkle) between a good, high quality diamond and one of lesser quality.  One thing Tiffany& Co taught me was that if you take a diamond out of direct light and it still sparkles like crazy, it's a good stone!  My fiance went to a small jewelry shop about a 2 hour drive away and special ordered a .75 carat heart-shaped diamond that was of higher quality than anything Tiffany & Co showed me.  He had it set in a simple 5 prong yellow gold setting.  It is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen!    One place that is good to start is to learn about the 4C's.  You can also read about girdle, culet, facets, fluorescence, certifications etc.  Each one of these can be researched and more!    Amazon.com actually has some pretty good information.  They even have a section where you can build your own ring for purchase.  I caution you about buying a ring/setting with sidestones because often the diamond side stones are of much less quality.  Amazon is also great because as you go through the build your own ring section, the information about the 4C's has a link on the left of the screen.  Once you select a diamond, you can click on any of the other aspects of it to learn more about them as well! http://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Engagement...    Also, if you want a diamond that was not a "blood diamond," like those in the movie also named "Blood Diamond."  I would suggest using http://www.brilliantearth.com/.  Brilliant Earth has beautiful rings that are made from recycled metals and have diamonds that are mined in conflict-free Canada!  If your girl is in to the whole "going green" thing, it may be a smart move to look there.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	What if I said, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! Or I will LOVE YOU TO DEATH|`|rZXQvA75aa	Just remember, you may be uncomfortable in the first place (What guy isn't, it's a very nerve wracking experience!) so if you go into the store and the sale people are pressuring you to buy something that you can't afford or making you feel uncomfortable in any way then feel free to walk away and go to another store. You'll find your right fit. My husband told me that he went to 8 different jewelry stores before he found the right one.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Do you have a sister or mother? ask them to tag along.  If not just do your research- have a price in mind (and stick to it) a cut of the diamond id recommend the princess cut, what type of metal yellow or white? what size you want- no smaller than a 1/2 is my advice. know her ring size as well .  they have there own sections but if you want something like a gemstone ring they'll likely be where the gemstones are.    http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/ring...|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Could you get one of your friends (or their gf or wife? women have a LOT of diamond/jewelry buying knowledge) that has been through the experience to go with you? It's a lot better to take someone with you that knows the ropes than to go it alone. Good luck and congratulations!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	My advice would be, before going into the store, think about how much you want to spend. When you get into the store look around, when approached by a sales person, tell them what your looking for , and tell them a couple hundred under what you are willing to pay at least, this way you can low ball them, and it will give you some breathing room if you do like something a bit more.|`|FvZQv7Euaa	Just go to a nice jewelry store where the people are friendly, because then you'll be able to tell whether or not they will be helpful.  If you go and they aren't very friendly go to a different place.  Usually you can find a nice salesperson that actually wants to really help.  Just tell them what type of style she likes (if you know) or what kind of girl she is, and answer any questions they have.  They should be more than willing to help.  It might be a little helpful to do a little reasearch online before you go just so you know general price ranges for what kind of rings, or what styles you really like or prefer more than others.  Good luck!!    =]|`|s1oDY9Tfaa	After having worked in a jewellery (I'm Canadian, pardon the spelling!), you don't need to worry about the salespeople being pushy, at least I wasn't. They really like to help the guys that seem confused. And yes, there is a special section for engagement jewellery. Some jewellery stores even have custom designed engagement rings, so if that interests you, ask one of the salespeople and they'll probably refer you to their goldsmith/gemologist/custom jewellery designer. I would go into the jewellery store knowing the 4 C's of a diamond: colour, cut, carat and clarity. This will help you understand the pricing of diamonds. Second, you should know if your soon-to-be fiance wears white or yellow jewellery. White and yellow gold are great for engagement rings, and platinum tends to cost more.    Hope this helps, and congratulations!|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	I would look into the 4C's first (color, cut, clarity, ct. weight). Get some basic knowledge before going in there. Most sales people are good, but there are some that are out to get you to buy anything - they have quotas, and in this economy they may not be selling as much as usual. A good site to get basic info on diamonds is:    http://www.nefj.com/4cs_of_buying_diamon...    Google some more to get some other sites. It's always nice to know the info as a frame of reference.     Also, I personally would stay away from mall jewelers. They tend to have higher mark-ups (200-500%) than free standing stores. Do some research and ask around about good store that are willing to legitimately assist you.     Remember the prices are always negotiable. Plus, you are in a better place for negotiations if you have knowledge regarding diamonds before looking. Always look through a loop to see the stone up close, and make sure the stone has a certification with it.     You'll find something. Just don't let them talk you into the credit cards or going over your budget. Stick to your guns and read up on diamond information and you'll be all set (and stay away from the overprices, and lower quality mall jewelers!).     Good Luck!!

Sorry I can't be of any help though.|`|71VRvldJaa	If you've been with him for over two years and you're not comfortable enough or trust him enough to be naked in front of him, you shouldn't be together.  I think you need to work on building your self esteem and self image.  Anyone who is a size 4 and can't handle looking at themself in the mirror needs some professional help!|`|fDuCamMraa	I have a personal training class. After a few sessions with me you will have self confidence and as a bonus you will learn how to teach him how to satisfy your needs. You will also lose your timidity about being naked. Write me for details.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	kay well think of it this way. your boyfriend wants to have sex with you. he knows what your body looks like, if he says your not fat, then your not. guys dont lie about that becuz they dont want to sleep with fat girls. so your golden! but if your really that self conscious about your body i would wait another month of two and do some yoga or something. get some abbs and a lil leg muscle. it looks really good in te end becuz your legs wont jiggle much ( not saying they do) and your stomac will be harder and flatter. i also suggest black lingier ( i totally forgot how to spell that word) black and lacy underwear from victoria secret there! just remember he likes your body.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Non-judgmental answer: Leave the lights off - maybe get a night light you can leave on.   A couple drinks before hand will help lower your inhibitions as well.   Don't get sloppy drunk - you want to remember your first time.  Plus vomiting will surely ruin the experience.     But check out your B/F's goods first - pre-turning of the lights.     You know to make sure he doesn't have any herpes sores - better safe then sorry.  The chance of contracting herpes while using a condom and with no sores present is low. Better safe then sorry.    I think it is great that you waited until you were an adult. :)  I see NOTHING wrong with taking the relationship to the next level.    You didn't ask for reassurance but keep in mind that he is going to be so excited he wouldn't notice any of the flaws you think you see with your body- you could have a bum covered in pimples, he wouldn't even notice that.    In general men are not as shallow as society tends to portray them. Women spend for more energy criticizing each other then men do women.|`|NaRecWBYaa	party  get drunk  f**k  he won't remember in the morning what you looked like just how good it was|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	You should talk to him about why you don't want to do it. He will probably help you feel more secure about your body image.|`|LWwGW48Daa	YOu sound fine to me! How aboout a sexy nightie?|`|HWkXDSqkaa	Your at a perfect weight.  And i bet your body is amazing.  Just do it.    He obviously loves you and isn't gonna judge you.|`|VZPvTKZOaa	I don't think your fat. Your 5'5 and you weigh 130lbs..that means your healthy. Your not 5'0 and weighing 130lbs that would be a different story.|`|cVSwO3Uzaa	hey, if he loves you he will accept you they way you are, plus you are not fat and if you look good with clothes, now naked... you are fine dint worry about it too much|`|VEEgoDkFaa	A size four is far, far, far from fat.  You might not actually exercise the motions of having an eating disorder but mentally you are there.  You need to get over it because it's not healthy.  If you need to talk to someone then I suggest counseling before something happens to push you closer to actually having some sort of eating disorder.  Trust. ';-()|`|lJhl3wLAaa	You have to love yourself. You should love and accept your body. Things only get worse over time. The older you get the slower your metabolism, the harder it is to keep fit. You will look at yourself in 10 years, 20 years and say "OMG, what was I complaining about?"     If you don't love yourself now you never will. It has been my life long struggle.     Try reading "You Can Heal Your Life" by Louise Hay.  or "I Can Do it" by Louise Hay. Very good at helping you get on the right track in your mind.|`|LNkXcxlfaa	if you are that uncomfortable then try running. it will shape your body nicely and you will feel more confident. i'm sure your boyfriend loves you for you and will love the way you look naked. if you don't feel comfortable being totally naked the first time you have sex maybe you should get a sexy bra that you could leave on that will make you look and feel sexy|`|bT0WNmkraa	Go spend the morning watching people at Burger King. You'll feel sexy in not time!|`|fHgJdJGwaa	Wow you sound EXACTLY like me. Only I'm like a size 7. Everything else though, height,weight,etc sounds the same. I wish I was a four. But I have more hips. ha ha. I hate it as well. But I've been told i'm not fat. ((although I wish I was like a four or five like you)) anyways, if you really want to have sex you should totally do it. I know your body concious but you shouldn't worry so much about it alright?     I was the same way too. and My boyfriend would get annoyed or not want to have sex because I would be distant with him as far as sex goes. so I just gave in. I wanted to do it of coarse. But I just tried to put all my self conciousness away just for him. and I did. I stopped saying I was fat to him and things were a lot better. even though time to time I wish I did have a better body. But the thing is your boyfriend prob. wants you to be confident in yourself. ands trong. :) I know my boyfriend does. I'm still weak at times but I know he wants me to be happy with myself as well.    So just hang in there. Stick your head up high. and figure out things you like about yourself. :)|`|Izv6Qj4caa	im 5'5..130 lbs..and 17..im very self-conscious about getting naked..but hey, i deal with it..i dont think im fat..i just dont like the thought of being butt naked for my guy...  so i wear cute camisoles and tank tops..and i always keep my bra on..  as far as panties..not trying to be "graphic" or anything..but i take them off..tell him your not comfortable with your body at the moment and im sure he will understand..tell him to just push your panties to the side if u dont want to be all the way naked..lol..dont kno if this is what u were looking for but hope it helped..eventually u will feel comfortable with your body chica..|`|K2QwEM4raa	You are whoring about nothing if he has been with you for two years he must really love you. Look around the next time you are out and really look at all the people and their different shapes and sizes, not just the ones that you think are better looking. Most of them are having sex. So it doesn't matter what you look like. He sounds like a great guy who accepts you as you are. The best kind of guy to have. Lucky you. I have one to.|`|O57Ky6D0aa	I can't believe he's waited over 2 years! That's quite a man! Size 4 isn't that a size 8 in britain(I'm English). That's very thin indeed! Maybe you should get some counseling to help you deal with this. It's a lack of self confidence and self esteem I've never liked my body out of clothes either, in clothes is fine lol! Your boyfriend loves you so much and he wants to share this emotional thing with you. Sex does connect two people. I think your sensible waiting till your 18, that's an achievement I think. I lost mine at 15 and now I'm staying abstinent till I'm married. No judgment whatsoever you do what feels best for you but I do commend you on waiting two years!|`|8P6MmLv0aa	If you are that self conscious then why not plan it the way you would like it, plan a romantic evening and set up your bedroom take the bulbs out if necessary just put 1 or 2 candles about so you have a bit of light spray a bit of sent about then when you are ready just go in there get into bed and call him in, you don't have to see what you are doing and this can be fun just give it a chance.  I would Always let the woman turn the light out if she wishes as not everyone is that confident.  good luck.|`|AA11447210	You need to work on loving yourself (emotionally). You're an average size at 130 for your height, and wearing a size 4 sounds like you may be muscular (as I'm only 1" taller than you and look too thin if I get under 135).    Trust me, guys have far less issue with how women look than women do. We're our own worst critics. If he weren't attracted to you, he wouldn't be with you. If you feel more comfy initially in low light, or leaving some clothes on (like your shirt or a long nightshirt that could be pulled up for 'access') then do that initially...when you are ready to have sex.    Don't do anything until you are ready. Regarding sex the bigger things to fear are unwanted pregnancy and STD transmission...not 'he's going to see me naked'. Honestly.|`|USxxSS7qaa	Your boyfriends clearly loves you for the way you are. You'll forget all about your image when you having sex...trust me.|`|Gxv4SX5taa	First of all, you're NOT fat, those are perfect stats.      If you and your boyfriend love each other, that is all that matters.|`|k1REVuYNaa	dont have sex till your married. and dont sin too much|`|AA10882162	guys really dont care if ur fat if they love u they wont say anything|`|3653KNYDaa	tell him to close his eyes  or well your riding him, tell him that theres two of you on him :)  with his eyes closed, he will NEVER know.|`|826IxsmMaa	You should talk to him about it, honestly.. after 2 years, he would probably understand. You have to be confident with your body in order for him to find you sexy.   Also, you could always have sex with the light off if you're ready|`|qifVnERIaa	if you love him and he love you your body do not matter|`|MbdjBUXWaa	Go to a doctor quick, talk to friends about it. You do not want to end up dead.|`|XVDZAiiVaa	i have the same problem i hate my body , im not fat but im not good looking naked (haha), i know how u feel so if u think of it is a dark room under the covers ..then maybe u will be fine ?, plus if he loves you he will not mind.|`|qTm7WV6Taa	If you feel bad about yourself work out.Tell your boyfriend the truth im sure he'll understand|`|devDlDiJaa	Aww, your body type sounds normal, you are not fat at all. You should not feel bad of yourself. You also should wait until you really are comfortable with yourself before having sex.|`|DwZiiQmkaa	Well if you like him he wouldnt judge you on your looks (He doesnt care on your looks he  cares about you)|`|fxsX0t7Naa	you need to see psychiatrist. 1. for telling all of your personal business on the net. 2. for calling yourself fat. 3. for saying you are not looking for attention when you obviously are.    btw, it's gonna hurt really bad and you may start bleeding.|`|5IferJ9Haa	go to fredericks.com and buy a piece of sexy lingerie that is lacy see though or even satin and wear it... you can take off the panties but leave the top on and he'll think it's sexy too... some people say whats the point of buying it it ends up on the floor anyway, but it doesn't have to be that way... i keep it on b/c of the same reasons as you and every now and then it comes off, but only in the dark and he still wants it just as much... sometimes elegant sexy is sexier than nakedness.|`|j9p3wivfaa	aww, dont worry a sure he already knows what size you are, and hes still with you. it helps to turn the lights off or low when your naked. and get naked when in bed not walkin around...|`|JCFLE9mGaa	OMG!!!

Your boyfriend probably wont care because he loves you :]  But if your REALLY self conscious,  Then do what i did and get a gym membership.. i work out 4 times a week, and ive been dieting for a while now  Ive lost a lot of weight and i feel soooooooo much better about my Weight and body!  Don't over due it though  Because it sounds like your at a healthy weight already.    Good luck!  Hope i could help|`|Sz05dOdUaa	maybe you should talk to him about it. i was in the same situation like a month ago. and then i thought about it.  my boyfriend loves me. he doesnt care about my flaws. he loves me for who and what i am. and he thinks im perfect just the way i am.  your boyfriend should feel the same way about you. i know its hard but he loves you and doesnt care what you look like. my boyfriend thinks i lok cute in anything. i remmember one tim ei was wearing his pajama bottoms and no make up and my hair was a mess. he just looked at me and smiled and told me that i dont need to lok perfect all the time. he loves me for who i am.  good luck with  everything :)|`|a4da5109c8bdb18661f94827b55902d5aa	i think you should take your time with it and talk with your boyfriend about why you don't want to have sex, tell him how you feel and he should understand, or you could try starting with turning the lights off. good luck and i bet you have nothing to worry about x|`|IkItAVizaa	i feel really bad that you feel this way because it sounds like you have a near "perfect" body!  own what you got, girl!  obviously your boyfriend thinks you're beautiful, among other things, if he's been with you for over two years.  and anyway, you don't want someone who is going to judge you for your body, anyway.  :)  guys aren't as judgmental as you might think and are just as insecure about their body!  maybe just take it slow.  you don't always have to be completely naked to enjoy sex.  do what -you're- comfortable with not what your guy WANTS you to be comfortable with.|`|L2xa4gvYaa	im not being judgemental..but just make sure that ur losing it to the right person, because seriously u will regret it no matter what if they turn out to be a manwhore or a cheater and cheat on u with 8 girls like my ex did..but otherwise, girl you are lucky that you are 130 and at 18 i would give anything to be that weight, im 5"2 and im 18 and im 174 pounds i feel so uncomfortable looking at my boobs sagging and strethmarks on my legs or my sides.if u dont have those u should have nothing to worry about, show off yourself to the world..lol jk..but if he doesnt mind your body, you shouldnt..because he loves u the way you are obviously...i need to learn the same with my bf..but goodluck and u dont have anything to worry about|`|TtWqeSF4aa	Just go for it my girlfriend is the same way but it really doesn't matter if you want to you should  just have it with him because if its lasted for two years it means the size doesn't bother him so there Absolutely no reason to be self conscious.  good luck|`|GfyovDF5aa	If your boyfriend has been with you for two years, then he obviously loves you for who you are.  I'm sure he thinks you are beautiful.     I think you should tell him all this.  Then he can understand why you are hesitant.  Most likely he will tell you that you look amazing and reassure you that you are beautiful! I feel the same way most of the time.  I am very insecure about my body, even though I am at a normal weight (as are you).  But I know the feeling.  My boyfriend tells me that I am the only one that thinks badly about myself, everyone else doesn't see what I see.  I think it is the same thing for you.  You are your worst enemy and biggest critic.      Do you exercise?  I found that even if I don't loose weight, I feel better and less self concious after exercising.  Maybe you can find some lingerie to wear for your first time.  Lingerie is VERY slimming and sexy.  This way you won't feel as self concious since you won't be naked but you can still have sex and your boyfriend will think you look AMAZING!     Hope this helps you.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	It is easy to decide whether you are fat or not in an objective manner.   You are 164 cm tall and weigh 59 kilograms, which means your body mass index is 22. BMI of 19-25 is "normal weight", you should not weigh less or more. Which means, you are not fat.       Secondly, if there is anything specific about your body that disturbs you, you can either work on it (abs or boobs or whatnot), but I'm not sure an 18-year old normal weight girl who has a loving boyfriend can really be worried about her body.     Thirdly, two years? Don't you think that it's time to admit that he loves you not some wanking material that weighs 12 kilos off the gloss magazine pages? If you feel insecure about this, it might hurt him - why would you want to hide anything. So.     Go with the flow.|`|H5oWHQDHaa	Talk to him about it, I'm sure he will put your mind at rest. He's in the position of wanting to have sex with you because he finds you and your body attractive, so trust that if anything. Maybe you should take it in steps? Just get comfortable hanging around in just a t-shirt or in your underwear just cuddling etc.? I don't think you have to plan to go the whole way...right a way and once you see his reaction when he sees you wearing less clothing, you'll be reassured.   Last but not least, unless you wear really baggy clothes, he'll have a good idea of what you'll look like naked anyway.  I hope this helps...Good Luck!|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Don't worry about weight or body features.    Would wait until 18 though as it is not good for you or society in general.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	If you want to keep him then you should really not worry about yourself...it will distract him|`|Is3pmbbKaa	if he loves you he won't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet.    ........|...  ........|..........2 points ........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|OsHjXzxUaa	ur boyfriend is OBVIOUSLY already attracted to u. and with guys, as soon as they like a girl, they like EVERYTHING about her, especially her body lol so dont be self conscious with him. but if u want to feel better about urself. for the next 2 weeks go running for an hour everyday, ur body will tone right up and while ur running u can think about everything and tell urself how great ur gonna feel after this. ull b having sex in no time lol :) well hope this helped! and good luck! :)|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	You're clearly very beautiful and special if this boy has stuck with you for 2 years :). Remember a number like how much you weigh doesnt matter at all. Some of the victoria secret models weigh more than you do! 130 pounds isnt a lot. Besides you could weigh 150-60 pounds but if you look good thats all that matters. If I see a beautiful girl with nice curves and a face to kill for is my first question going to be "how much do you weigh?" OF COURSE NOT. I would walk up to her and begin chatting her up immediately and if it turned out she weighed 170+ pounds I wouldnt care. Girls with more muscles naturally weigh more because muscle is heavier than fat, you probably have a nicely toned strong body.|`|MLgknFlVaa	Maybe if you toned up you would feel better. You can be slim and still have a poor body image if you are not toned and tight. Especially with all the anorexic models out there and celebrities that have millions of dollars to look good. If that does not help I think you have deeper issues at hand and it probably has nothing to do with the way you look. Your sub conscience might be holding on to that for an excuse to avoid the fear of being Intimate with anyone. At the same time maybe you just really need to find some one you truly trust to lose your virginity to. Either way maybe you should try talking to some one about it. good luck

Have a honest talk with yourself, your parents, and most important, with God. He is the one who will always be there for you. Have faith in Him.   For me, I plan on staying a virgin until my wedding night. It will be so much more special that way.  It's your decision but I honestly hope and pray that you make the right decision for you.|`|wVfqXHFraa	I was 19    We ended up dating for a while and we had good fun together so I'm happy with my choice    BUT it is good to wait as sex makes everything more complicated!

gC8xO53Oaa	I'm not exactly like your situation, but close. I lived 2000 miles from the man I married, and we never saw each other from the time we started talking on phone until 1 yr. later. Now before you think something is wrong with me, let me tell you who he is. He was my high school sweetheart and we hadn't seen each other for 25 yrs. We started talking after we received the invitation for our class reunion and the rest is history. I was in Louisiana and he was in Calif. I think the time we had conversing on phone allowed us to get to know one another deeply and there were no other distractions if you know what I mean.Ha! When we saw each other for first time, it was like we'd never been apart because we had the opportunity to learn about our lives before this reunion. We've been married almost 18 yrs . now and It's no different a marriage  than if we'd been together through the whole courtship. You two can make it if you really want it. It's not how far the miles that matters, it's the closeness of the heart. I wish you both the best.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Before I got married I would want to get into a living situation where we could see each other every day or most days of the week.  Not saying you have to live together, just that you need to know what it is like to be together A LOT.      If you love someone 1 day a week you will likely love them 7 days a week.
XTy7mLAkaa	Aren't girls grand!?  We give you all kinds of mixed signals don't we?  Don't fret young lad.  She likes you and is trying to find ways (other than with her mouth) to tell you.  Hang in there sweetie.  She'll come around.      You may also want to get her a card that mentions becoming more than friends.  Give it to her and go away.  Don't wait for her to read it.  Let her come back to you later to give you her thoughts.  Don't let the card drip with L-O-V-E though cuz that may be too much.  Be subtle and aware that she's shy and she'll open up to you even moreso.      Good luck!|`|1VDrq2bzaa	sounds like she does like you    but just be careful so you dont get mislead.|`|5g0gJFvcaa	she definitely likes you but like you said she is shy so i say   potential lover    ps. answer my problem plz!|`|tjBLEQ8waa	DUDE! She definitly likes you and its sounds like u 2 should definitly go out. I had a girl do that to me but then she started to like jump on me or something so she got way too slutty and i broke up with her. Hope it works out for your HOTTY!
WK5s7VSaaa	from what you're saying it seems like she's kind of playing the whole "hard to get" thing around your friends. but if you've been in the relationship for awhile she shouldn't b playing those kind of games anymore. she could also feel uncomfortable showing affection around other people. Irregardless, you should definitely tell her that her behavior is bothering you, otherwise she'll never know. i personally think it's quite rude if she's your girlfriend and kind of just puts you on the backburner when you're around other people. maybe she doesn't realize she is, but just talk to her. oh and thought i'd add twilight is incredible =] good luck =]|`|aL0uWmSLaa	well what i say is u let her know u are pissed off in a subtle way and let her know that u don't like putting up with that kind of stuff just let her know how much it bothered u     Hope i could help :)|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	Talk to her and ask her why she acted like that  Ask her if that she's embarrassed to be with you?|`|0bjQfb01aa	Maybe she's mad at you or is trying to get back at you by ignoring you. Try to talk to her and ask her what is wrong. She could have just been nervous around your friends and is mad at you for making her hang out with them. Just talk to her and buy her some flowers or do something special for her- also maybe schedule some alone time where it's just the two of you. A surprise romantic candlelight dinner would work.|`|eJJwALuZaa	***** slap her ***|`|1McGOu5daa	talk to her.

7f7cb849a34bb56cf8aab71d599736a8aa	WOW. It seems that only insensitive guys are the ones who can actually get a girlfriend and decent guys can't. There are some guys that are real jerks but there are also plenty of guys who are not insensitive. SO if the problem you're having is finding a guy who isn't a jerk then I'll tell you not all guys are insensitive jerks BELIEVE IT OR NOT. I consider myself a decent guy and have seen insensitive guys who treats girls not that great and the girls just seem to not care or keep their feelings locked up inside. But not all guys are insensitive so just keep looking and REMEMBER we're not all the same. Personally it irritates me when guys who think they own or don't care how their girlfriend feels, and they just go on as if nothing is wrong. I just graduated high school and have seen and know what you are talking about but just know we're not all the same. Just hang out at places you might both enjoy and get to know each other better before becoming official or getting too attached. I hoped this helped even though i kind of just rambled on and on.<br>  <br>  |`|CuiWaH3Yaa	It isn't just men who have this problem and can't see what is right in front of there face, I know quite a few women who have also wished they had there exes back,because what they thought was on the other side wasn't what they thought in the first place.|`|YMrF3tWkaa	It is all about strange. |`|ckaJA9Exaa	some men, like som women are unable to see what a great thing they have no, its not always greener

9yFdxmHwaa	He makes you happy, smile, laugh......    Only thing you have not explained is, do you guys talk? If he doesn't know that you exist, it'd be tough. Tough for you, that is. Doable, but still tough.     1. He knows you - He has broken up with his girlfriend, right? If you were friends before, now you flirt with him. Spend more time with him. Then tell him that you would like to be his date for the dance. If you are shy, then do it over the phone. Say hi, (reaction :hi), what's up (reaction: nothing much/whatever) and then "would you...."    2. You are a bat and he is an outdoors guy ( He doesn't know you ) - Smile at him, say hi or wave whenever you see him. Stop being self conscious. Try to talk to him. It doesn't have to be politics, anything would do. If he moves in groups, like in groups of 2 or 3 guys, start talking to the guy next to him then ask him for his input. Then you talk to him alone. Get familiar with him. Then follow the step 1.    Only problem is the time frame here. I am thinking, 2 would take at least 1 or 2 weeks. Do you have that much time?    Good luck for your dance!!!|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Aww that's so cute! You should ask him if he wants to hang out then one time when you go somewhere together just say "Do you want to go to the dance with me?"

lJq4cbnBaa	wow ! I feel for you. You are getting mixed signals from her . I would say be her friend first and give her time to recover from the ex first. If you use your friend ship to build a foundation on you could end up with her or just a really good friend . here applies the saying if you love some one set them free if they come back to you they are yours . But don't stop being her friend . yes I do believe in love at first site or at lest lust. you like her heart that is a start of realness of the bonds of love to think of them first as to what is best for them speaks of love too. I loved my best friend and let him walk away. it took thirty years for us to find each other again and this time it is great and we are getting together so super happy I still had to spell it out for him . he needed to know how much I still cared for him and how important he is to me . stay in touch  give her time maybe it will not take you both so long to figure it out. best wishes

People like that think they are secure but they really aren't because they are always looking for approval from others to make themselves feel good.

If she don't and talks about you, tell her only whores were a ton of make up to look pretty and that's why you can't keep a real man. She sounds like she has issues though cuz no older sister should be like that.

c2dbcb9d4cabe528a87b05b4fc95a676aa	Aww...! That's reallt sweet... But maybe you need to give her some time.. We dun usually give our heart out just like that. It takes some time and a lot of trust cos once we give our heart out, it might end up getting broken.. Like mine.. But not cos of the guy, cos of parents interfering. Anyway the guy was somewhat like you. Exactly what you wrote, he did.. But it wasnt 5 years.. only 3.. And funny thing, i was like her.. Just give her some time..I wish you both all the best :)|`|13d04618cfbff4362800afb490aef9e3aa	hey step it up the female feels the same way u do tell her how u feel, and tell her that ur friends will never be broken, she waiting 4 to step up|`|a4e9260f81f23da3665dac0e77e65039aa	Ok.  I think you should sit down with her and just flat out ask.  If rejection is what scares you, think of it this way.  You are not the first and certainly won't be the last to be rejected.  Also, there are plenty of fish in the sea if she does reject you.  Keep your head up though cause you just may be surprised by her response but definatly ask her!!  Good Luck!!|`|AA12383944	well time.. thats all or u know ask her out!!!|`|AA11313208	She likes you so much!I think it is very awkward if the girl try to do the first to talk about her feelings!You got her feelings already and she falls for you!Go on propose a relationship to her and goodluck!|`|326d87a2fb18c39a47a79888651f55aeaa	You both seem to be into each other, you just need to make the move.

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	Not really sure what the best course of action is but have dealt with similar. This peron is just plain ungreatful and probably has a chip on their shoulder that implies that the world owes them something so they do not feel they should have to show gratitude for what they deserve anyway. You can either stop doing these things for this person and let them see how much it sucks to not have what they lost and maybe they will change OR you can confront this person, which usually does not work except to make matters worse.  The Godly way is to forgive the person and love them despite their flaws. Sometimes you just have to let go and move on. At times, that can be more traumatic for that person and is sometimes the catalist that wakes them up and paves the way for them to change on their own. Not sure what else I can say. My ex-best friend of 22 years was like this and I finally had to let her go. I was her only friend and we have not communicated in almost 2 years. I am still very sad but sometimes you do what yo have to. Hope this helped!|`|AA11722750	she has self esteem  problems
AA12063466	I dont think the White men who like Black women approach them enough. They seem so sure that they will be turned down.

Give me a break....let them get married.|`|9c923d3c5614654eb4e28b4b2ebf8bc5aa	I see your point, but there are many issues and even more people out there that are concerned about them.  In China, babies that are born female are killed by their parents or given up for adoption because the parent's want a boy to carry on the family name.  In Mexico, there are kids on the street sniffing glue and rotting their brains because of it.  These kids are homeless, starving, and nobody, not even their government, cares about them.  In some Asian countries, children are sold into prostitution by one family member, and then killed by another family member that finds out they are prostitutes.    The people who are opposed to gay marriage feel very strongly about why they don't want it.  Laws, debates, issues, politics...everything that comes up seems to have people on both sides willing to give their opinions and stand up for what they think is right.  To answer your question, each person has to choose what it is (if anything at all) they want to be concerned about.  In other words, some people don't have anything bigger to worry about.   Everyone is different, so we'll all find different things to be concerned about, right?|`|AA12377184	Bible thumpers.  The world is going to hell in a hand-basket, and we got bible thumpers still (and always will) worried about banning gay unions - it's because these thumpers are brain-washed.

People are the way they are. I for one am for gay marriage. We have other issues to worry about in this world.|`|AA10331591	I so agree.  Why dont people spend the time that they worry about gay marriage on world hunger, poverty, the war etc..|`|4edc836c72e2b4a3dcd2128629566f74aa	because some people think it is a sin and just not right|`|059eeee3f63499110e2b3a8c02597c97aa	Well, yes and no. I do agree that everyone has a right to make their own decisions. However, the Bible does state that homosexuality is wrong...and people that claim to be Christians and live that particular lifestyle are liars and hypocrites....then again so are all the others who claim to be Christians and still purposefully live a sinful life.
NowyO5dBaa	It IS a problem if:<br>  <br>  You neglect responsibilities to have sex instead.<br>  <br>  You're using sex to keep your relationship together.<br>  <br>  You're using sex to avoid handling conflicts.<br>  <br>  Sex is blinding you to your lover's faults.<br>  <br>  The only thing you love doing with your partner is.... your partner.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're already in a committed relationship, are eachother's best friends, know eachother inside and out, and can effectively handle conflicts and other difficulties, and have open communication, then go for it, have all the sex you want.

Jejeje, es mi opinion|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mi querida amiga: la mayoria de los hombres (si no es que todos) creemos que el tama?o del pene es significativo para probar nuestra virilidad y no hay nada mas falso que esto. Yo creo que esta tendencia se da debido a nuestro pasado cultural y social que desde siempre ha tendido a "competir" entre los hombres por conseguir a sus "hembras" (perdon por la expresion pero esoy tratando de ser lo mas explicito posible), entonces la unica forma que la mente diminuta de los hombres ha encontrado es comparar sus "herramientas" para la procreacion.    Hay algo muy importante que la gran mayoria de los hombres no sabe y esto es que el 90% de las terminaciones nerviosas de la vagina se encuentra en el primer tercio de esta, que al tener una penetracion demasiada profunda llega a ser incluso dolorosa en lugar de ser satisfactoria, por ende podemos entender que no es necesario tener un pene enorme para poder satisfacer a una dama. Es muy cierto que a muchas mujeres les gustan grandes, pero a mi parecer esto puede ser porque ya han caido en el juego de los hombres: "entre mas grande mejor". Respeto TODAS las opiniones, puntos de vista, gustos, preferencias y demas de toda la gente, unicamente trato de expresar mi muy humilde punto de vista.    Saludos.|`|8aa66d8446342ced82b200cfadf1e277aa	Por mas que digan que no, asi es, un pene mas grueso o mas largo es mejor. O se van a conformar con 7 cm? , aparte al hombre le ayuda que su miembro sea mas grande puesto que mejora su autoestima y asi su desempe?o sexual no se ve afectado por cuestiones mentales, aunque tenemos claro que no solo eso es la base de una relacin, porque al momento de hacer el amor se incluyen los sentimientos y los lazos afectivos que hay en la pareja, en los momentos en que la pasin se desborda una mujer pide todo lo que puedas dar, tanto sentimental como fsicamente y si ests favorecido en esto ltimo la experiencia es casi mstica.

87f936b151812275e32957d6ade75d79aa	Even though you broke up, he is probably very possesive of you still. He is actually doing it to see if you have started dating again, so he can get all pissed and feel sorry for himself. He is basically looking for attention. So, next time he call and asks "whats up" tell him that your boyfriend is coming over and you will be going to catch a movie or something.........that'll get on his nerves, and he may actually tell you why he is calling.  Good Luck!|`|1d6d272d31ba2a264285fff44884da0aaa	He is having regrets, and doesn't respect you.|`|AA11798687	He is trying to get some ex-sex.

cP9MoCc6aa	I think it means he does.  But when you said he said "yeh, i looove her" that kinda put me off a little  I still think he liked you with the blushing, looking down, and looking out the window because that's what happens when i guy get either nervous or embarrassed, but he probably said the last part to ease the tension inside the car.

So yes, it seems he does like you=]|`|zUCYj26Paa	This means he likes you a lot some guys are just too scared to let the girl know so this could be the same thing just talk with him and let him know how you feel and see if he feels the same.
3ctchU2faa	If you go to a joke shop, they usually have these coupon books for Valentine's Day.  The coupons are usually for a different position, shower sex, sexy phone call, etc. If you don't want to be that forward, make him a coupon book with all his favorite things in it. For example, one coupon can be for a free back rub, one afternoon playing his favorite video game, dinner and a movie and on you, or a batch of his favorite cookies.

She stole my pants, but they didn't fit her, fat whore.

So when you have looks that society rejects and you know that everyone is going to look down on you for it and hate you no matter what you do (based on something you can't control none the less), you stop giving a **** about what people think.

Your attitude that you want pure sex, and no "relationship" if you are dating  only the "nice" girls.  And, Honey that's why you're still a virgin!

If you want hot and steamy sex without any relationship, then you'll have to go ( past "nice girl" )  to another kind of girl, that  as I said, wants the sex, but no relationship.    They are few and far between.  I suggest that you try hitting on the girls that are rich, and want only a bad boy.  Try college debs, on the weekend.

Second of all since hot steamy sex is all you want, thats probably how your searching.  Just like one of the others said, even if a girl may be a freak who gonna want to have a one night stand, they'll rarely admit it.  No girl wants to feel like a hoe, even if she's doing hoeish activities.  Im not gonna say try to act like u wanna relationship either and then break the female heart cuz dat aint cool either.  Just stop searchin for it.  I know u all hot and horny and stuff but its when ur not lookin dat what u want comes..AND DONT GET NO DAMN PROSTITUTE!!! it is way too many deadly *** diseases now a days, hell u cant even trust your spouse now a days so please just take your time and if you happen to be a virgin til your married..itll be safer and worth it...GOOD LUCK!
xMCuUvd4aa	 A lot of people try to simplify this issue.  We are rational beings, therefore, cheating is a rationale choice. the animal discussion is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  We as people made a rational decision to create an institution called marriage.  There were lot's of reasons for this, but it works pretty well.  It inherently involves sacrifices by both parties.<br>  <br>  Many of the traditions of marriage across cultures are misogynistic and give men the upper hand.  This is a reflection of the male dominated societies where the institution came from.<br>  <br>  In the old days, women got the lesser of the deal.  They pretty much got what they got and sucked it up if they were unhappy.<br>  <br>  Those days are mostly gone in the US.  <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, Women aren't quite willing to suck it up and sacrifice an important part of their existence any longer, men, to some extent, have always been this way.<br>  <br>  Cheating is the manifestation of a person putting their own needs ahead of the marriage itself.  At some point, the mutual vow is deemed to be of lesser value for whatever reason.  He or she reneged for whatever reason, so therefore I am justified.  It is a reasoning step that is taken to rationalize it.  Cheating is not just a sex issue, it is a companionship issue, it is a respect issue, it is a hell of a lot of issues...<br>  <br>  It isn't discipine or lack thereof, or animal instinct, although, our sex drives are a critical factor, it is a conversation that a person has with themselves about the value of their marriage, their own unhappiness, their partners commitment to them, the way the want their lives to be, and how they are going to deal with it. Once a person is at a point where this discussion is going on in their head, thoughts of cheating arise. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't even presume that all cheating is the same.  Some may start with an intellectual attraction, and lead to sexual attraction, some may be just raw sexual attraction.  there are too many things that drive people in different ways.<br>  <br>  Eventually, if the marriage is over, the spouse is told, whether there is a new couple to ride off into the sunset or not.  These things usually don't happen with out some hard conversations in the lead up to the break-up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this answered your question.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|TBsVYf8Daa	i think it happens when people suddenly meet the better ones (in terms of not only physical, but also personality). at first they might deny it and try to think more clearly. but the more they think, the more they imagine the chance to maybe be adored that much, appreciated, needed, and respected once again. one time the temptation comes, one may reject it, but if it comes time and again, or maybe it is surround him/her, it might be thought of a destiny? the way this someone new treats them may feel like he/she is actually "the one" and they have been with the wrong person this whole time. <br>  <br>  i don't know, i can't really blame people who fall in love at the wrong time and place, as well as with the wrong person maybe. but i've experienced a feeling of love so strong that it has the power to wreck, ruin, and break anything, only to allow one feels and has it freely. but to me, it wouldn't be fair to cheat on someone we have loved. if people find love in someone now, at least have the decency to tell the s/o. i won't say it's easy, as a matter of fact it would probably be one of the hardest conversations people would ever make, but they owe their s/o at least that much. <br>  <br>  no matter what, so sad to watch good love go bad.....|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I HAVE to tell myself that, anyway it builds character. I have looked in the other direction once and told my husband and I could see myself shrinking in his eyes.

For everyone to have come common decency and respect for one another and keep it in their pants until they got out the door?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that is NOT how todays society works.  Instead of risking someone else's heart, they prefer to see if they can get away with it or hoping not to get caught while they see if the grass really IS greener on the other side.  Sick, yep!  <br>  <br>  Never done it myself, never would.  Wouldn't want it to happen to me... so I wouldn't do it to anyone else.  Karma.... <br>  <br>  Almost forgot... I understand that the reason most people cheat is only because they found someone that will do for them the things their partner at home is not doing.|`|scMMpPciaa	Not not really. People have deep emotional needs and if their partner does not step up and participate that how can you expect them to just ignore their needs.  To be wanted as a Woman, to me was one of the most over powering emotions I have ever known. To be desired makes you feel alive and free. A marriage is also suppose to provide that but most marriages cages you and hold you down. If married couples would learn to take care of their partners needs as well as their own their would be less failed marriages but people are very selfish in marriages which lead to divorce and affairs.|`|ad9AssJZaa	I hate it when people chuck it up to "human nature" because "we are all animals afterall" but we have certain things that animals DON'T like, oh, I don't know, emotion, morals, common sense. So I don't take any of that "human/animal" nature crap seriously. Oh yeah, guys cheat because they want to reproduce and have MANY offspring, then why the **** do they use condoms?? I know that isn't what people are really saying, this is how they compare human men to animals. Animals act on INSTINCT, we don't have much instinct and are gifted with REASONING and RATIONALE, so that's what makes us different from animals!! For Christ's sake, when most animals have sex, the male is essentially RAPING the female, so should we excuse rapists because it is animal nature and we are just animals, afterall! I know I didn't answer your question, but now I will. People cheat because they can't control themselves, they do it because they want to. I didn't want to eat that cake today, I want to lose ten pounds!! Did I eat the cake anyway? Yes, you know why? Because it was so darn sexy I couldn't resist!!!|`|wI3AAkIoaa	With my first ex, it was the lack of sexual desire with him.  I needed to know if I was still normal!  Bad excuse, but the truth.  I saw someone else, then asked for a divorce.  With my last ex, he had his girlfriend living with us for over 5 years!  He told me I would be killed if I left... so I did what I needed to feel good.  And later left when life was not worth it if I had to be with him... needless to say I am still alive and now happy.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I think both men and women who cheat are the type of people who live in the moment. They don't think about how their actions may hurt others involved. A lot of times they use excuses "oh I was drunk" or something lame like that. There really is not excuse for cheating except that you are a very self centered person.|`|ggnYryDoaa	I read an article once that said 90% of men who cheat - cheat because they don't have an emotional connection with their spouse where as 75% of women who cheat do it because they don't feel a sexual connection anymore.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds sexist (?) but I always thought it would be the other way around. Ya know?|`|1z7N3C9faa	I think it is lack of respect for our partner.  <br>  <br>  What makes them cheat is either a lack of respect from the get go (some people never respect their partner) or a loss of respect.  |`|6fd4e1a5aa0206bfc6a1ce509a0f2507aa	People are generally selfish.<br>  |`|72MtoWxRaa	I agree with both of your other 2 answers so far. I agree that men are selfish and want their cake and eat it to. if they have invested years and children into a marriage and they meet a new woman, why immediately leave the wife for the new one when they dont know if its a fling, if its something that will not last. Why lose a family over not knowing what you have. Sometimee men get bored with the same routine day in and day out and want to switch it up. Instead of asking their wife to switch, thy go out and do it themselves. Younever know with anyone.|`|4LJnYm1Waa	People cheat because it's in human nature, especially in men.  Humans, like other animals are wired for reproduction.  More partners means more chances for reproduction.  Men are more likely because one man can hypothetically have thousands of offspring, women can only have a dozen.  People also cheat because they don't love each other anymore, or the passion is gone, etc.|`|YN5cZsXNaa	i would never cheat is nothing but still  not got n opportunity to do so!! every1 hs some minuses and every1 hs some xtra-pleasures!|`|VBJOR4YRaa	Ignorance.|`|HktofDYNaa	now wheres the fun in that?|`|zMREMMO3aa	it doesn't go that way... try doing that and you might end up with a slap on your face. |`|3652865bf75234629480db3292c40bc6aa	My wife cheated on me approx 35 yrs ago, approx 7 yrs into the marriage. It was the early 1970's age of "Free Love." It was a one time f**k. She was at a party while I had to work. The spirit of the times, and the party, overtoook her. There was a considerable amount of tequila involved (which has always been an aphrodesiac for her). I would never known if she hadn't told me. But she did tell me. We went to counseling. Put our marriage back together stronger than it was before. I have never mentioned the incedent since. And she stays away from tequila if I am not around. lol|`|tOdjjeAmaa	i think some guys need the security of a family so if the fling doesn't work out they will have something to go back to. i think that's why a lot of men cheat and their wives never know, and why they eventually go back to their wives.

9bf7611ea4f1890cbd887c2f75406d32aa	In relationships, there's never really a right or wrong. But people believe that there's a certain way that the girlfriend should be treated and not be treated. Viewing the situation, I can only say that he seems to have over-reacted, especially after you apologized. Seeing that you had a sore throat, he should've been more considerate to your condition though.<br>  <br>  However, there's always more than the eye can see. It could be that he's in a bad mood, or something happened that made him upset earlier in the day. I think the only reason he could be mad is because you were inconsiderate. Maybe he's sensitive to those things. Or maybe, he just needs alone time.<br>  <br>  I can't say much about it because I don't know him personally, but in a relationship, compromise and forgiveness are staples to making it work. If you manage to get to talk to him later, try to figure out why he's mad and don't lose your temper while doing that. Getting mad never makes any situation better.<br>  <br>  Wish you the best of luck!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	No one deserves to be treat like that, for a bottle of water!<br>  You forgot, and took a drink, it's hardly a crime.<br>  <br>  I bet he has done things, which you have instinctively forgiven.<br>  <br>  Dump him, tell him that he can buy water very cheaply and that you are "so sorry" that you took a drink!    It's not like you sat cackling, conspiring against him to make him ill by licking around his water bottle is it?<br>  |`|Z0VvcKCraa	It was just a water....he shouldn't of made you feel that way or blown things out of proportion. If the water meant that much to him, then I'm sure you would've bought him another one or something. If he blows up for inanimate objects like that and makes you feel bad for something that can be replaced, I feel you need more communication and understanding. You need to tell him that it isn't right for him to react for something that can be replaced, like i mean he can be upset but not to the point that he goes "mental." The water can always be replaced but the time he wasted being that mad is gone.|`|PyC1MIkXaa	Wow... I don't know why your boyfriend would get so bad like that. Because I know that with my boyfriend, he wouldn't care if I got him sick. But um, I don't know. I guess I could understand that he didn't want to get sick from you. So, maybe you could just say that you were Sorry, and that it was a mistake, and maybe he'll just calm down.|`|s9yItMt5aa	Both of you were wrong because you have reacted the same way he did.

If yes... your lack of sibling tollerance is the issue.... if no.... either a hidden problem or his time of the month is to blame (I am serious about the time of the month thing... whilst men dont bleed.. they suffer surges and drops in testosterone which can lead to mood swings)|`|sYRBS6cTaa	if you guys kiss or hold hands or do anything close like that... he is going to get sick, I don't see what the big deal is about sharing some water... sheesh.

It also might be that something else is really bothering him and what you did just triggered his built up anger/stress/guilt.He might also be just wanting someone to blame.You should talk to him about it and try and see whats really wrong. Hope I helped!|`|LB0paiwjaa	That's not a good sign.  If he's going to get angry over accidentally sharing a few germs... imagine if you make a mistake that actually matters.  It was an accident and you apologized.  That should have been the end of it.  It sounds like he has a real temper.  Be careful.|`|c36ea85c97bd1a60d907b44ea9c5e6d3aa	its tricky he shouldn't do that to you, but I would go talk to him and see why he was like that and explain why you did it, hope you sort things out :)|`|Gm27Cpwoaa	sounds like he was really overreacting! He shouldn't have gotten mad over something so stupid! its only water!|`|SCVVTZPGaa	no one is wrong bec thats jst the way it is dont judge|`|whRBSWJhaa	lol... that is pretty stupid!! u said sorry...its him - he doesnt sound nice at all!!!
b3FkhOicaa	No, i would think it was sweet that you thought i was joking!
mBe9sb3Xaa	No, both do not need to know. I divorced my ex husband without knowing where he even was. I had to place an ad in the paper in the last location I knew him to be in. He had a certain amount of time to respond. He never responded and I had to appear in court, on my own. However, being one is in another country the process might be a bit different. You both do not need to sign anything. |`|H8WqMK1eaa	I don't think so...unless the person is in a persistant vegetative state or comatose (I'm not trying to give any ideas here!!!)|`|9iOjhq9eaa	In some places a person can get a divorce based on the fact the other person abandoned the marriage. The court will try to contact the other person, but a lack of signature will not hold u back|`|B1sT1t44aa	Hold up here because believe it or not it happened to me. My ex husband was so busy dating another woman that when the courts sent him our court date he missed it because he never even opened the letter. I went to court that day with my lawyer and the judge could not believe that a man would not show up after a 25 year marriage and 4 children. He believed me when I told the judge that my ex never paid attention to me and the kids and gave me everything i asked for. After 2 months my ex called me trying to put the fear of God in me that he had a good lawyer and I was going to be sorry. Well... I told him that I was sorry that he couldn't use him because the divorce was already final and he was lost for words.|`|ZsirbIIUaa	Both people need to sign, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  This is why I'm an advocate for marriage licenses that automatically expire after two years and have to be renewed by both people.<br>  <br>  This way, it's easier to divorce (and fairer to guys who ALWAYS end up losing the most after a divorce).|`|ffb42367736232c58e1232280031062aaa	No. 1 person can FILE w/out the other knowing but eventually they get a copy of it. Theres no way 2 people can divorce w/out both knowing. They both have to sign for it...

Para empezar no es lo mismo un orgasmo que una simple satisfaccion sexual, una satisfaccion sexual puede ser autoinflinjida (masturbacion) y un orgasmo, para mi gusto es de dos: de ahi viene la frase: "El orgasmo es de quien lo trabaja" y en una relacin de pareja el orgasmo es del que lo tiene y de quien lo provoco o indujo... asi que si no queda claro con lo que te he mencionado quiere decir, para mi claro, que una de dos:     1.- Que no te han satisfecho sexualmente.  2.- Que no tienes una pareja sexual y no sabes realmente de que hablas.     Quiero que te quede claro que no trato de ser ofensivo ni mucho menos, simplemente que debes de ver bien dentro de ti antes de poder solicitar alguna opinion, te reitero no quiero ser brusco ni mucho menos y si por desgracia lo fui, te ofrezco una disculpa.     Recuerda algo muy importante, no es unicamente tu gozo personal, sino tambien el de la persona que te esta ayudando a tenerlo.
VUR8hhiTaa	I met my boyfriend on http://wwwsinglesnet.info  It took about a month, and he showed interest in me. I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|yg5P4mBlaa	Online dating does work. But people keep on forgetting that there are problems posed by meeting someone you don't know in real life. Try to follow some of the tips for safety: http://blog.vintaku.com/2009/02/03/onlin...|`|m6xvhlJqaa	yes and no....u could cheat and he owuld never know....that could be bad for one and good for the other..|`|DK6kYxmGaa	For some people it does, and for others it doesn't. So far it hasn't really worked well for me. So, I kind of gave up on it---and I had a couple of different dates with different guys from online---they were either too lazy, my parents didn't like them, or they didn't like me for some reason. :(    Good luck. :)|`|eKGwK6rKaa	well it did for me I meet my bf on myspace and after talking for a while we meet and now i live with him and were engaged.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Sure it can work. I'm in the online dating / Internet business. It pays for my lifestyle.... so it definitely "works".    But whether or not it "works OUT" --->> is going to be up to YOU. And not up to any website.    Imagine . . . . I get to type in "under 25, brunette, slim, sane, employed, within 50 miles of my area" , click "search" and BANG!!!!      . . . . look at all the "soulmates" I wouldn't normally meet in every day situations.    But whether or not she is worth meeting, dating, or getting into a relationship with - isn't up to the website. It's up to HER.    It's great. Have fun. Enjoy.|`|AA11313486	yeah, if u take ur time to get to know each other|`|yuh7OsHDaa	ahah somewhat  u gotta be lucky  i met my guy on a dating site  ( plenty of fish ) aha!  and i was on there for jokes,  and now we r kinda serious lol|`|bgi0AtiFaa	For those doing it for the right reasons it does work. It's really safe way to meet people as opposed to bars or clubs. With online dating you get to see a little about who the person is before choosing wether or not to meet them. Best thing to do is always be safe. Always meet in a very public place.|`|TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,Sara Cullen.  How are ya?  Is there a reason for your question?  You met someone,Didn't you?  Now,I'd say that online dating works as well as long-distance relationships.  But then again,If you believe in your heart that he's the right guy for you.  And he feels the same for you.  I'd say go for it.  Sara,In order for this relationship to work,You must be honest with this bf of your's.  And he must be strictly honest with you.  No lies,No cheating,No deceptions.  Next what you should do is to purchase a webcam so he can see how beautiful you are.  He should have one too.  If you care to,I'd exchange addresses so you can write to him.  It can work out for the both of you.  Well,That's if you want it to.  You know,Valentine's Day is coming up.  Mail him a valentine.  I'm sorry if I sound too awkward,Too bizarre.  I'm just excited for you.  Sara,I'm gonna get rolling along.  You have yourself a goodnight tonight.  Bye for now.

AA10297617	its 2 hard 2 explain but actually it depends on how d parents brought up their children.    i grew up in a very close family ties. my parents always treated d 3 of us fairly that's y no sibling rivalry ever occurred.     she gave us almost everything we want & she took care of us with tender loving care.. my dad was @ this tym abroad working so it was my mom who did all d parental care..    she moulded us 2b gud individuals, never 2b jealous or envy abt other people's success, 2b contented w/wat we have, 2b helpful & giving & so many more..    if u grew up in this kind of environment, i think u'll pass d tradition & that feeling of love throughout ur next generation...|`|AA10696192	Communication. A close-knit family talks often, involves every family member in decisions, they support each other and help is given without having to ask for it.  For example, when we moved into our new house, everybody volunteered to help with decorating, moving furniture, doing small repair works, we were never alone and all went very smoothly.|`|AA12169898	Well in my Family when we leave each others house (even if we live together) we always say something like "Alright love, we'll see you later" Thank you, bye"  even when there really isn't anything to thank them for.  We always say be careful, or just small things when we leave or arrive. I think this matters so much and is over looked so often.|`|AA11163561	The secret of a close-knit family is "sacrifice" and "love".  If one person wants something the other might have to sacrifice it once in a while if you love the other person.Also, the other person should respect your feeling of sacrifice and should return it with love. If this is the way, the family will definitely be close-knit!|`|53c8e76004a58fda73f41bf44a2fdcb9aa	There are few words to be practiced in ur life. Love, Patient hearing, Respect to each other (whatever be the age), Sacrifice and above all spend few time with all family members on daily basis with some of the topic. Go around here and there often with full family.  Realisation power is not same for all the people. but in family if we step down for some reason it is not our defeat. After all we r all in same boat brother.
8ndZqbtAaa	Punch her dad to death!|`|5gNPWNwCaa	Im not sure where you live, here in the UK we have childline, and its a free confidential advice line where the people on the other end are qualified to deal with this type of situation. This is a very sensitive issue and as a mum of 3 children i don't know what the hell i would do to my husband if i found out he was beating any of them, id probably be in prison for murder. Please speak to a teacher or close relative who would know how to help your friend. I really do wish i could do something to help, it makes my blood run cold to know a child is being hurt in anyway. My prayers are with your friend, and you must remember you are a very special person to be standing at her side through it all, my prayers go to you too xxx|`|jzazkrAQaa	That's a horrible situation to be in and I sympathise for your friend.<br>  I understand how she feels about her father earning the money for such a large family (and in such an economic crisis) but abuse is wrong no matter what the situation. It doesn't just go away, it gets worse if anything. I'm not certain how your friend feels but I'm sure she wouldn't stand for it if her father beat one of her brothers or sisters.<br>  I would tell her to tell the school, a teacher (one she trusts), they have to do something. No family should have to live in fear like that.<br>  I hope everything turns out all right.|`|0UdJx1SWaa	ask ur mum if she can move in with u or report the dad to police and the family can be supported by money given from the government ''depends wat county ur in''

And anyways, if he called u and u guys hang out and stuff, why would he resent u?? Just call him!!!|`|ba2d632a3ae826f6a7d5385da46ed5efaa	I think you should  call him but don't call him everyday because you'll look (and sound) like a stalker and you might scare him away. But I do think you should call him, you never know... and if he is annoyed he'll propably make excuses like "I can't talk right now" or "I am busy" and he'll say it most of the times you call.|`|AA11190264	baby girl, calling him once a week is fine. if he has the problem with that. then you should think that he has more than you to think about.

AA12241224	I think the bottle of water represents your feelings for him. And when he says "oh did you want this" he is referring to weather or not you want him to have feelings for you in return. I think your dream may be telling you that he is taking more from you than he is giving to you emotionally. The mutual ignoring in the beginning is telling you  that you need to have more open communication with each other, this is necessary if there is to be any kind of relationship in the future. Then again just like any advice take this with a grain of salt. What do you think it means? Let him know how you feel, you will know when the time is right. Don`t seam to eager, but try not to come off like well it really dosen`t matter to me one way or the other. One more thing in your dream your mother gave you something that distracted you, this might be a sign that your mom might be getting in the way somehow and keeping you from fullfilling your desires. You have all the answers inside, hope this helped.|`|AA12360662	Let me analyze this dream for you.    this dream basically is about relationship    Family bbq = family gathering event  crush = your love one  mom = your love one  Kitchen = plece for necessarities.  water = necessarity      In your dream, bascially it is telling you that you do not really trust the guy you love.  It is in lack of communication between him and your family.  I projected him as part of your family member because he was invited in the bbq event.  However, he is taking over the main role in your dream.  He can do anything he wants in your dream.  You on the ohter hand try to find something you need - water and yet took it away.      Something we have to notice.  This guy is a free will person in your dream which you do not want him to.  He can take anything from your house because he was invited.  However, subconsciously you are telling me that you are trying to stop from what he is doing.  You want your freedom and yet he is taking away from you.  Because of that, you do not trust him.    In conclusion, you may not fully trust your crush even your family has no protilem with thim.  You may be parnoia and fear that he is taking over your position as a family member.  A little of jealousy I may say.  This may be due to lack of sense of security and trust to him in your part.  You don't take him seriously, and that is you have that dream    I could be wrong, but ths is how I see from the dream|`|b52a21f69a160e212fa0f0b8dad1d118aa	You have given this guy a piece of you.|`|4c22247028c88cb77ba83922437878afaa	oic. you like him but you cannot have him. he seems to be taking with your vitality (water), the important things in your life, maybe you are pre-occupied with your infatuation and you cannot get you things strait, his is too much in your head and you cannot function normally  in your life. maybe that's it. make a move or die trying!!|`|4ff32397b50513bfb18781fa0e988fd4aa	i think by ure mom being there it repersents,to u that she gives good advice,cause u say the boy was there n ur mom was having u do things,i think the water repersents something good is going to happen to u n your boy friend,cause his mentioned n ure dream a couple of times about the water.if u hav not told him u have a crush on him,ask ur mom if u should tell him.hope u have a really nice day.|`|AA11883844	try this site...  http://members.tripod.com/mindseye32/dre...  you can tell them ur dream & they'll interpret it 4 u...might have 2 answer a couple other questions, but u'll get it interpreted...lol...  good luck...

165e6652a58dd5b4e96ffab092bedbc5aa	To legally disown someone you need to go to court which means you either need a lawyer or petition the court yourself. However, you do not need to do all that to just disown them in so much as to just not claim them as being any part of your life. Depends on the neccessity of your situation. I disowned an entire section of my family in only as much as I refuse to acknowledge them as any family of mine and I make it no secret that I take this position! I have not spoken to any of them in over 10 years and will not! Ever! Get on with your own life and simply leave those you do not claim behind. That is the best way to disown someone. The drama of a court thing is really not neccessary.|`|c44f9c1eef49aed7e8aa4a2573590d1faa	I am not 2 sure!|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Legally? I guess it would depend on the relationship.

No matter what family will always be there for you so dont do anything that you will regret later.|`|844e7149e3bd9a1064a01b0c65da6442aa	do u mean lik.. disown them from ur family?? well..i wonder what they did...lol i bet they came out to u and u went crazy lol....    jk ha|`|5a34a3e0e0d4323ce12c9550434d6de8aa	I'm pretty sure there is no legal way to disown a child, parent, or other family member. It is more of a personal statement or decision to publicly deny that person is your child, parent, etc.
AA11475133	It's called being trusting.And I agree it's stupid.|`|AA11427901	Oh really, do you look at yourself when you're trying to impress a girl? You're just as pathetic as we are.|`|AA12048646	.  .    Should they first believe that you are a liar?  If they did that, my friend, you'd never get a date.    A woman should TRUST that you are all that you say you are.  If you later prove yourself to be a deceiver, then it is your fault that she believed in you, and you let her down.    The only one that is pathetic is a liar.    stw|`|AA10727617	i knew you were lying to me!    you are so dumped!|`|d9f6c13f6da37d1684ffdce18339d0e3aa	As a female.............I'd say that the only women you've been exposed to are too trusting.  Don't categorize women that way.  We're not all overdramatic pansies.|`|2d41a17d1eee3b822a70e62b7874dcf0aa	dont play around and confuse us..yell us e are getting outta hanqd wealways want the truth even if it hurts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12102221	Please use the spell check and the nearest English book available.|`|AA10368751	It's the hormone.|`|AA11038959	Hehe!!

I am compared to him all the time in appearance and it gets me attention.|`|AA11725936	a bit scary...  i'd stay away...|`|AA10372773	Is his wallet in proportion to his size? That definitely helps the  cuteness factor.|`|AA12289063	He is good looking in his own way. Not my type, to many muscles, and he looks sorta intimidating.|`|AA12116802	i think stone cold is not only cute but sexy too he is my all time favorite wrestler and i just love him to death how any one can think he is ugly or scary is beyond me those muscles are what makes him sexy or at least a part and the way he can down a beer is just a complete turn on|`|aedbd6e0245ab9fe4013fc3f886e9e1caa	Yes, even better in person. I would do him anytime love the body. Why do you think that you look like him if so mail me at shel_must@yahoo.com|`|4f437854ffed52663b23c58565277f3aaa	not only am i more handsome, but i can whup yo @ss you wife beatin, steriod shootin, fake fightin ugly@ss f@g        I LOVE YOU BRITNEY>>>>>PLEASE LET ME COME HOME!!!!|`|AA11583927	I dont.

u4FGBKi4aa	It does not matter.....|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	text him a short msg, and wait only a short time for his reply!  he's probably chasing a girl with lower morals+standards than yours!  don't change to accomidate his over-active hormones!|`|9wwhKkWeaa	He's probably asking the same question as you, but to himself.  If he doesn't call/text 1 or 2 hours before you both are meant to meet up then do it yourself.|`|L14jkonXaa	it depends on what day you guys have had. Since he is probably nervous, text him with a simple "hey" or "are you stoked for later today?" That should do the trick|`|tD0nI64xaa	Usually its the guy?  But sometimes girls need to make the first move|`|vxhQWwaHaa	a guy should always text you first-they like to chase  but sometimes(sumtimes) yeah sure go ahead text him
WW2JKr0Yaa	I think that you have anxiety and are worried about not knowing how things are going to be once everything is said and done. You have been used to things the same way for so long, that you can't litterally imagine the change|`|6PbyKpHzaa	i understand what you are saying im just as scared for when my brother goes off to college next year. Of course you might lose a little bit of closeness but if you guys make sure you talk on the phone, email or what ever i think you guys will still be close and of course visiting each other every time chance you get |`|BCRIQ8c8aa	My sister got married a couple of years ago and we were very close. her husband and i were close too. i thought i was going to lose mine and my sisters good friendship. But actually I have got another really good friendship! My sister and i still have our sister-sister time and there is times that i want to talk to my brother-in-law without my sister! everything is going to go great! The marriage will make yours and your brothers relationship even closer!! |`|ndsnmSjoaa	<br>  Think of it this way, you are not losing a brother, but gaining a sister.  Seeing as you are close to both of them I don't think you will lose him.  They might even invite you over for a weekend or two.
ce0659a5a00543395c7ccef4628b44e6aa	ask him a question about whatever class his teaches, and maybe you guys will start talking. just be comfortable around him and dont act like your nervous.|`|a2aa2d36aad551aaee8e80c291a33efbaa	Try talking to him more, and to flirt while talking keep eye contact and if he says something funny GENTLY hit his arm or touch his arm when he says something.   When you see him ask him how's he's doing, where he's going. Give him a compliment ask where he got his shirt. Don't be shy! Smile and act confident, Guys like that kind of thing!     Good luck, Girlie! :]]|`|9jddst2gaa	All you have to do is after he says hey you say hi what did you get on the math test or ask him something about his life.  Then after he answers you start talking about yourself and maybe say do you think this shirt looks good on me and depending on what he says next you will know how he feels about you|`|YOdupDCHaa	first DONT TALK ABOUT UR SELF!! ask him what he teachs and if you no ask him to help u with ur home work or some thing like that. oh do it like my girlfriend did it before we started dating every time i had to leave she would give me jesters not to leave and id stay longer. make him feel like u wat him around u all the time. it worked on me so try it!|`|1UOIoOzKaa	Talk to him on your way out of class, ask him how his weekend was, be chatty!|`|yIHlvPFfaa	I agree with sophie on this one, stop him as he passes by to say hi and introduce yourself and ask if you guys can see again tomorrow, just be yourself and stay calm and casual it should come smoothly.|`|Xprsabo9aa	Just be your self|`|R65Owmebaa	You just have to be brave and go for it. Get over those butterflies! its ok if you are nervous he most likely will think its cute. Just ask him if he wants to go out for  a movie sometime or hang out just talk to him..You don't want to wonder later....what if i talked to him what if? ....|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	Talk to him like you would any of your friends. Just go up to him, ask about him, show interest in him.|`|uI6fG9MQaa	Go up to him then give him a compliment like "I like your shoes" or "Your shirt looks nice" then he'll probably say "thank you" or somthing. Then after that say "By the the way my name is ......". Then he'll say "Cool" or somthing like that. Then just be yourself and ask him if he wants to hang out sometime or somthing. GOOD LUCK!|`|9aEjKzKCaa	Act normal, talk words:)

YrfjXxlwaa	Give her some money.
AA11731151	Your dad caught you or the rosebush caught you? This question confuses me. Anyway, your dad will eventually start talking to you again, even if it is to tell you that you have to do the dishes and as far as the rosebush goes, it will get over it!!!|`|AA10421757	Wait for him to come to you. I would have beat your asss|`|AA12282385	Just sing to him... 'Hips Dont Lie' by Shakira!|`|AA11767990	hopfully you didn't get any thorns....|`|AA12330513	I'm a Father of 3 girls,this would kill me if I would have caught one of mine doing this.you are very LUCKY he used the water hose.because I would not have let the boy off this easy.    you have hurt your dad A LOT nothing you say is going to help..give him time to heal his broken heart,    he knows this is part of the life cycle but he wasn't ready to think of his little girl was doing this.    I say Little's because to your dad you will always be his little girl.    give it time.don't push it.he will come around.|`|AA11478297	your nasty|`|5d13647aac662a230d8e38d345b01074aa	Talk to ur dad|`|AA11161470	ahahahahahahahahaha....the garden hose.

Have you introduced your boyfriend (the guy you were doing it with) to your dad? Why were you doing it in the garden and not in the bedroom? Answer these questions honestly, then you'd know where your dad is coming from.     One thing is sure here: your dad felt betrayed, and the only way you can regain his confidence in you is talk to him about it and be open and honest with him.|`|AA10988453	ahahhahahahahahahaha
AA12355707	to tell you the truth, i would say he DOES like you.. but you two clearly have some issues to work out with one another!|`|AA11595346	Marry him.  Quick, before he gets away!|`|AA12326388	man you chicks make it hard could it be more obvious whats he gotta do get cupid to snap kick you to the head and plant a round house to your belly. he wants you that way baby|`|AA11594681	Sounds like it, but you need to ask him what his intentions are.  He also sounds a bit moody.  Can you live with this in a long term serious relationship?|`|AA12057220	I would think having an ex he would not be talking about marriage unless he has deep feelings for you.|`|e371900da2d20e1ace7ec0ee80cebf29aa	First of all give it some more time. Also when a guy likes he does'nt forget to call. Just take it slow. It seems that you have a connection and that's good. I n my estimation I would say yes he likes you.|`|AA11832413	You need to get a peice of paper and make two columns Pros and Cons. You put the good thing he does and that you see under pros and the opposites under cons. If you see a lot of dratic changes then wake up some and slow down before you get any farther in the relationship than you need to be. It also sounds like he may be after any money he can get from you. You would just be supporting his other children and putting more into the relationship than he is. What's to ay he won't do the same to you?|`|bbb1b7c4c9d044e30cfcc5d414da1002aa	iono|`|50e4115d8d3ea0212c263af7e8b20127aa	i think he likes you but not as much as he acts like it i think you should break up with him and find someone that likes you fully|`|AA11282088	Well you have to take into consideration that he works aLOT of hours a week and people don't realize that a relationship is also work and also takes time to nurture... So the question is not do he likes you but does he have time for you and the kids|`|49a7876e36acba7210a4271e6d5e55edaa	He likes you. If he's being a gentlemen when with you and is working hard, he's a keeper.|`|AA10147317	Alright, I personally think this guy has feelings for you but, I have been there and you are going to have to give him time. If he truely likes you he will eventually come forth and tell you. The guy I'm with did the same stuff sweetheart, so just give him time.|`|2451b476567333ffa013a56449c569f4aa	It sounds like he is going to great lengths to impress you.  As to whether he likes you, that is harder to answer.  My advice is to enjoy his company and get to know him.  Take your time.  No need to rush to the chapel and get married.  If what he feels is genuine, and you feel the same way, it will only get better by waiting.    You both have ex's which means you've struggled in relationships in the past (haven't we all?)  Maybe spend some time examining what went wrong in those relationships.      Working on those issues together could be a great way to build trust and strength in this relationship.|`|AA11421535	HE LIKES YOU BUT YOU TAKE YOUR TIME BEFORE YOU INVEST ANY MONEY WITH HIM , HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HIM ? WAT ARE YOUR AGES TAKE YUOR TIME HONEY IM 41 YEARSOLD THINK ABOUT IT FIRST I HAVE  HAD GUYS TELL ME THE SAME THING AND I STILL TAKE MY TIME. LISTEN TO THAT WOMANS MIND FIRST .

Roses are for valentine ..don't go there. Is she into writing? Get her a memory notebook. The last resort and the safest is always a picture frame..you can go with very small, fantasy or anything.

AA12162812	That looked more like some sick form of torture to me. The man didn't seem to enjoy himself and his face was all redd.  If a person is excersized it will be ok to stand on his tummy and walk over it, and maybe jump too. but this guy seemd very unfit. And standing on someones chest isn't really healthy.|`|AA12297084	i wouldnt cuz that would seem like it would hurt much.

9edd02463cc9ecb426a5763235046334aa	he likes it the way it is.... if he hasn't proposed in 13 years... the odds are... he probably won't do it any time soon.|`|AA11434798	IT'S BEEN 13 YEARS ALREADY MAYBE HE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED|`|AA12253112	13 yrs and not married yet and hes joking about it?  Hes really joking, hes definitely not ready to settle down.|`|6f951d5ff255f7665b68dfb6fe0e9b14aa	Sounds like Bob never wants to get married, but if you do, you may want to find a new man.|`|AA11462534	sorry you've wasted 13 years when you could have found and married someone great in that time, but please don't waste another second, leave now|`|67fb920650bb04354bfdf5feada5f1a8aa	I really don't know i think that this guy just isn't serious enough for marriage|`|AA12283653	tell him that marraige to you is serious and if he doesnt want to marry you than you need to find someone else cause you want a family and you need a man in the family|`|97b151f8fc2f58bf168eccca0210732daa	I think that "Bob" is not taking you seriously, you should have a sit down talk with him and explain that marriage is very important to you. I fat that point he still feels the same way than maybe it is time for you to cut Bob loose.|`|78dcba0ae50098c309370ed63e9a37caaa	you guys probably live to gether which is bad your not suppose to live with a man if he's not your husband because  he is use to your ways already and theres no point or maybe is afraid of commitment and if after 13 years he doesn't know if your the one then leave him. He is probably cheating alot or something|`|AA10735939	Just tell him you want to get married and you want to know what he thinks.  Tell him he's got a couple of days or a week (your choice) to think about it and at the end of this time you want a serious answer. And if you don't get one it's over!
PMdxyhLwaa	I personally dont think that it's shallow in a way because sometimes reality hits you and you never no when it can happen.. this actually has happened to me too but later i realized we were better off as friends, but in your siuation this may not be the case..   if you really like him and you know for a fact that he likes you, shoot for the stars and ask the guy out!  if you're not sure about it, there is absolutely no need to rush! you never no what may happen and also.... u said that ur not "strikingly beautiful or anything" but maybe thats not what he sees ;)  Good Luck!|`|lbsskdmuaa	idk what do you think|`|1kQLOxpAaa	Not shallow at all. Sometimes it takes another person point out how good something before you realize how lucky you are. Sounds like you really like him, but only as a great friend. Don't pursue him just to keep other girls from having him though. He doens't deserve to be "messed" with that way. You'll hurt him in the end and ruin a great friendship too.
35ICVnYIaa	you could be friends but there is the possibility   that every once in awhile something would arise   creating a really awkward moment between the two of you.  If you find him dating someone else whilst your friends with him you could find yourself hurt as well.    It's really up to whether you think it's all worth it!|`|ibOD8ggDaa	yes soon he will want to be more than  friends because he got to know you for you.|`|Y9hBknBuaa	i think he still has feelings for you. So he could want to be more than friends at some point.|`|j9SP0xLcaa	Well, lemmie see.  He could, but DO NOT! I repeat! DO NOT! Come on too fast! Boys freak out some times. LoL. Don't feel bad about it. He could, might, maybe, wanna be more than friends. Don't get really interested, its hard to let go after a while.|`|qCQJ7t3Oaa	Uh do not be friends with this douchebag. He went out with you for a bet. Even if he feels like a jerk, which he should, that is degrading and disrespectful. No one should use you in that sense. People problably talk crap about you now, if you were a bet in the first place. Im sorry this happened to you, but you need to not talk to him, dont be friends with him, and say I accept your apology but we will never be friends. Tell him he is a joke, and hang up the phone. Dont even look at this guy. If he says something to you at school, tell him He is an as-shole. You cant be friends with someone who only went out with you because he got money. He had no interest in you from the start, dont talk to this loser|`|HDaiuhvuaa	I think its great to be friends. It shows maturity in you both (something me and my exes cant handle lol). Im a believer that if you break up with someone the love or trust has to be gone. If you break up with someone to make a point, then get back together a little later, it tells them that you are not willing to work through problems and it makes the relationship a little less serious. Who told you he dated you for a bet? Guys say that sometimes just to be macho. They dont want to be all sappy and say that they wanted to make you happy.
DLS60sVBaa	Simply ask him. Did you try that? Are you afraid he might reject you? He'll probably not though since he compliments you in that way.
AA11199375	Well they probably dont know that there is better sex out there and just believe that they have made their bed and so must lie in it (pun intended!) Makes no difference to my relationship though. Marriages are founded on a heck of a lot more than just sex.|`|AA11312653	It is a good example of "correlation is NOT causation" is how it affects me. The same people who have a strong belief in abstaining from sex outside marriage (for religious or other reasons) usually also have a strong belief in avoiding divorce.     It's kind of like saying "Women who vacation abroad have 75% less chance of dying of breast cancer." It's not the traveling to foreign countries that decreases the chance of dying of breast cancer, it's the fact that such women tend to have money and hence better health care.    But you will probably succeed in convincing your less than bright listeners that virginity will, of itself, magically prevent divorce.     In my opinion, it is important for EVERYONE to have information about sex and sex safety. Think about teaching your children fire safety. Would you consider "Just don't be in any burning buildings and you won't have anything to worry about" to be an adequate education? Of course not!     Here are some links to information on condoms, birth control, infection, safer sex, alternatives to sex, abstinence, how to talk to your partner about sexual issues ... even a video on how to CORRECTLY apply a condom.  http://www.teenwire.com/  http://www.plannedparenthood.org/|`|AA10414936	i dont really care... and... i dont really care|`|AA11473291	I'm engaged to be married in March of 2007.  I know that if We chose to abstain then it would effect the relationship.  But, to a minimal.  Our relationship was never built on sex.  We built it on other levels first and making sure we put God above everything.  We couldn't be happier.  Hey maybe we should try it.  Thanks for sharing!

AA10240911	I am terribly sorry to hear about this sad situation. It's always hard to lose a parent, but even more so to have them suddenly stolen from you in a hurtful way. I wish you the best in finding justice, and will keep you and your family in my prayers.    Sadly more $$ will likely bring you more information.

I can tell you now mate, i had more respect for you at the beginning of your question than i did by the end of it.

xZOHlSXsaa	Hey, it's nice you care about your friendship so much :)    How about suggesting going out sometime say.. to the cinema or for a drink or shopping?    You could go out with some friends and ask him to come along (invite him to bring some friends) - You'd get to know each other better out of school/work and you can progress from there depending on how it goes.    Alternatively, just ask him out sometime and see how he takes it. You're friends so even if it doesn't go quite as planned, as long as you keep talking afterwards and don't let things get awkward, it shouldn't have any affect on your friendship.    Hope this helps =)|`|4PKuVsSzaa	as him out as a friend first and move on from there
913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	No he can't....you have rights even if the house is not in your name, it is your home. Do not leave, seek legal advice !!!|`|4VrKKOwnaa	lifes hard, and if this situation was reversed every women on here wold be saying " oh yeah, kick him out, mmmMMMmmm dont take him back girl " but he does have the right to kick you out, its his house in his name, if you have no where to go, not his problem|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Technically in the eyes of the law if the house is in the husbands name alone then yes he can ask the woman to leave there and then. Ethically he should have some decency about him and wait until the woman and the kids are adequately housed.  To "throw" a woman and 3 kids out on the street is morally wrong and I cant imagine any man being so deranged that he would expect the children to live on the streets.  Get some legal advice on this, it would make things a lot easier if people said what part of the world they lived in as any advice given could not necessarily relate to another country.|`|5TOp9HhHaa	There are laws against that sort of thing. The wife should call 911 when he tries it.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I think that's kinda wrong|`|AN9PdKmgaa	A court needs to decide this if it is safe for the wife and kids they can stay until he gets a court order|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Positively not  in any state I'm aware of, the house is more than 50% hers as his children need a home to grow in.  It would be illegal & he could be charged with child endangerment as one of the charges if he tried to put them on the street.  Advise her to call the police and contact a lawyer, last thing she wants to do is voluntarily give up residency of the home.|`|ujT5teZgaa	yea he could it's his house|`|xJWZTwFVaa	yes, its his house so yes!|`|U3qTwOOIaa	because she is married he won't have a cat in hells chance of throwing her out.  Also her children are HIS stepchildren and they have the right to live in their home.  She can live their legally until the youngest child is 18 then they can split the proceeds of the house.  The above used to happen in victorian times but thankfully women are better protected now|`|T6nmD3X9aa	nope, can not do it. If she leaves then she is abandoning all rights to that property so I hope she doesnt go. During their marriage, she contributed to the home (financial and otherwise) because marriage is a partnership. She does not have to go. Being married gives both parties the right to share are property until a seperation agreement or divorce is final. She should wait until the divorce is finalized, unless her safety, or that of her children are in jeopardy|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	No one should do that and i think he cant do that for u, for everything there is a solution and this is not the right solution from him, i think he is just saying that and he cant do it.  _K_|`|Z9aEClXnaa	if the house is in his name it is 100% his house. if both your names were there it work be both of yours.       i heard if its in his name and one else he has every right to tell someone that if they live with him.  if she would be homeless i wouldn't ever kick her out if she had no where to go. thats just me though.|`|rDs2e1Nhaa	No he cant put her in the street and make her homeless even though its his house.   He needs to take care because the authorities could ask him to go till housing for everybody is sorted.|`|vgNELAQIaa	I am assuming you are asking this question because it is something that you fear may occur.    The laws regarding this are different in every country and even from state to state (or province to province).    You need to seek competent legal advice for your area and specific circumstances. You should not seek "arm chair lawyers" opinions off the internet. The answers you can receive here will be either correct or totally wrong and misleading.    I say this because in some jurisdictions, yes he can, while in others, no he can not. There are also a number of variables to consider, such as the length of residency, the type of relationship, the level of contributions you have made to the home which can be in the form of monetary or physical (eg. repairs, cleaning, cooking etc..).    See a lawyer or legal adviser.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	She could go to a women's shelter.|`|KrdOKdJcaa	Legally, I believe the owner of the house can do whatever they want to do.

X|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	According to the law here, he cannot kick you out of your own home. No matter if the kids are not his. My ex tried that on me, and he was told that he would have to leave. Not me and my son.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	If she lives in the UK then the house is hers as much as it is his; having it in his name is irrelevant; under UK law it is community property and belongs to both of them (assuming when you say wife you mean legally married spouse and not common law wife). He can't kick her out any more than she can kick him out; if he tries, she could even get an injunction against him for unreasonable behaviour and he may find himself put out. This is not a long term solution however. If they are going to divorce, the house will either have to be sold or one of them will have to buy the other out. Best advice: see a solicitor.|`|yoQEs1KAaa	he cant insist that she leaves, its her house as much as his, shes his wife. and the court will also take the side of a mother and tell him he should be the one that goes. although he can insist that the house be sold to collect his half of the money from the sale.|`|e6MaU7nvaa	No because she is his wife, and it don't matter if her name is not on it. Even if she is no his wife, if the been together in a relationship inside the same house that makes them common law married, so if he tried to make you get out, and called the police for assistance. They will not make you leave because you all are married legally and or commonly married, Unless you were causing disturbance inside the home, but and still you can come back after the situation has maintained itself.     Good Luck|`|IF9OYLx7aa	No he doesn't but there are a few proviso's on this.  Are they legally married?  If so then the answer is no and the wife can claim 50% of the assets of the marital home regardless of whose name the house is in.    If they are living together as partners and the woman and children have lived in the home longer than a specified period of time (I am unsure of the amount of time necessary but any lawyer or Rev Can can tell you) then she also has a 'right' to be in the home.  Unless she is engaging in threatening or abusive behaviour it is not as simple as saying 'get out'.    Possession is 9/10ths of the law, if she leaves the home she may have difficulty returning or claiming marital property.  My advice would be to stay in the home AND if the man becomes abusive or threatening towards her to call the police, he will be removed, no questions asked, and she can get a restraining order against him which will prevent him from returning.  She MUST get a lawyer immediately in order to protect herself and her children's interests.    I wish her luck.|`|2pD0ctnhaa	The wife needs to seek legal advice quickly which is free from citizens advice bureau (UK)|`|YaB5bpv7aa	no they are married and she is entitled to half of everything unless sh signed a prenup|`|3enJVNDdaa	i wouldnt think so if they have a common law marriage|`|GmPIU2MNaa	Yes...

54d43f085882b670493b9dac6f21163caa	Fantastic idea, Mike, your fiancee will love it.  You could say something like this: <br>  <br>  "[Fiancee's name], there is one very small guest you've neglected to say hello to, but if he gets a kiss from the bride now he might let you off" <br>  <br>  then the puppy is brought up to her wearing a little buttonhole flower in his collar.  Maybe he'll even have a wedding card for his new mummy and daddy.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations to you both and I hope you'll always be very happy.  My husband and I were married about 7 weeks ago - I hope your day is as wonderful as ours was.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	I LOVE the puppy gift!!!  You could have one of your grooms men bring her before the wedding a small gift that would be  a cute dog leash or something like that and keep her wondering what the heck that is all about.. I think you have it all planned perfectly, she will be so surprised! |`|qicxk5GMaa	I think she'll absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!   and she'll probably cry her eyes out if she's anything like me.  Sounds very sweet!  congratulations!|`|5OGBneHLaa	You could do that.  Make an announcement that you want to give her a special gift.  Give her a box that looks like it would be for jewelry, etc.  When she opens it, have a little dog collar or toy in it.  Then the signal word could be given and a groomsman could come out and have the puppy with a matching ribbon around its neck.<br>  <br>  The puppy could be an honorary additional member of the bridal party.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|84d2ee0139a6557092dfc2736e3eadb8aa	Great present, but not for the wedding day. Puppys are a LOT of work, so when you get home, on top of all the work you'll have to do with thank you cards, photography proofs, etc., you'll have to train a puppy. Not to mention she'll probably won't want to leave the puppy when you guys go on your honeymoon! It's just too much.<br>  <br>  I would get her something else for the wedding day, and then a puppy for your first Christmas as a married couple. That makes more sense. |`|QmG2v1quaa	I think it's a really sweet idea, but here's the thing....what are you going to do with the puppy for the rest of the night at your reception. I mean it's supposed to be fun for everyone, dancing, eating, mingling with guests, so who's going to be stuck watching the dog?? It's a sweet idea just not very practical for a reception gift. <br>  <br>  On the other hand I had an idea of what you could do. Since you said you're MIL is willing to watch the dog while you're on your honeymoon, then why don't you just give you're wife a small present on the wedding day, and then have you're MIL put the dog in y'alls new house like minutes before you get back from you're honeymoon. That way whenever you're wife walks through the door she will see her brand new puppy. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and congrats on the marriage!!|`|pcQi36h7aa	I like the idea. A lot of people would be like "no, animals aren't gifts!!"yaddayadda(good they care...)... But the fact that you know she wants one is fine. <br>  <br>  What kind you getting her?<br>  <br>  I'm not really into smaller dogs, but my cousin has a maltipom (pomeranian/maltese).<br>  <a href="http://puppydogweb.com/gallery/maltipoms/maltipom_misquez.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://puppydogweb.com/gallery/maltipoms...</a><br>  <br>  Then my Future step MIL has a little maltese. <br>  <a href="http://www.tinypuppy.com/Maltese%20puppies.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tinypuppy.com/Maltese%20puppi...</a><br>  <br>  Pomeranian: <a href="http://www.whitepom.com/albums/userpics/10001/normal_caspar.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitepom.com/albums/userpics/...</a><br>  <br>  I like Boston Terriers...<br>  <a href="http://www.pups4sale.com.au/boston_terrier_pups_03a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pups4sale.com.au/boston_terri...</a><br>  <br>  But the BEST dog I ever had was a sheltie mix.

Tell her you have her a surprise and give her little hints wrapped in gift boxes during the reception and honeymoon. Then when you get back give her the last "present" which will be the puppy. I think she will thank you more for waiting till your guys get back than if you gave it to her on the actual day!|`|0hum2mOCaa	I think it would be a great surprise, and a good way of letting her know that you want to keep your promises! I know personally that I would adore a new puppy, and if you are already making plans for the pup to be taken care of, that means that you have thought all of this through. I think that is a good way of preparing for kids even! Good luck in whatever you do, I'm sure she will LOVE it!|`|qhPQvwzGaa	aww that's a great idea so cute, :)<br>  <br>  i was surprised with my puppy last christmas morning and he's the best present i've ever been given,|`|ALI0KCBIaa	I really really really love the idea of getting a dog. My fiance and I can not wait to get married so we can get two dogs, so I think this is so cute. However if you are not able to get the dog like you planned you could get her this bracelet by Tiffany&Co. This could double as her something "new" for the wedding. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/Shopping/Item.aspx?sku=GRP01707&mcat=148204&cid=288153&search_params=s+5-p+20-c+288153-r+101424820-x+-n+6-ri+-ni+0-t+" rel="nofollow">http://www.tiffany.com/Shopping/Item.asp...</a>|`|AyWWItGpaa	While in theory this sounds like a great idea, You have to consider that the puppy will not be used to large crowds of people and this may be a daunting experience for him/her.<br>  Who would care for the puppy after the unveiling of him/her , and being a puppy he or she will probably not be trained yet so you have to consider the fact there may be accidents.<br>  Also the puppy shouldnt be out and about too much til he/she had had all his/her vacinations.<br>  I think it would probably be best to present her with a large blown up photograph , or if the venur has projection facilities make a little video to project.|`|KmGz9o50aa	Do you have any idea what kind of pup she wants?  If I wanted a puppy, I'd also want to choose it.  Even pups of the same breed have entirely different demeanors.  I adopted my dog at 10 weeks.  She was with her brother, but he was loud and barked at everything.  She was calmer and sweet and remarkably alert and intelligent but very quiet.  She's been the perfect dog for us.  So much better than her brother who would have made me crazy.  It's generally a bad idea to get a pet as a gift.  I'd just take her to choose a pup when you get back from your honeymoon.|`|Opv7giYgaa	I love the idea of giving your fiance a puppy as a present, but not really a wedding present. I think your idea of how you would give it to her is extremely cute though.  I am a future bride-to-be and I think that would prefer my husband and I picking out a puppy together once we are all moved into our new house and home from the honeymoon. -We are  exchanging presents BEFORE the wedding ceremony (he is giving it to one of my bridesmaids and I am giving to one of his groomsmen that morning). You could give her something special before the ceremony and then have the dog at the reception.<br>  <br>  Good luck and whatever you pick will be perfect! Congrats!|`|fwCR1i3Kaa	I think it is a great idea! However, you will be extremely busy that day. My fiance and I are getting married in a couple months and we got our puppy in May, so she is 7 months now and still needs tons of attention. She is going to be 9 months when we get married and she is going to get dog-sat by my in-laws while we are on our honeymoon and I already know we are going to miss her like crazy! You and your fiance might be eager to come home from the honeymoon to see puppy (that's not what you want!) <br>  Those first few weeks are pretty crucial to a puppy too. Especially because you'll want to start house training right away. The puppy will want to stay in it's new home right off the bat for a while. Can you imagine how it will feel being taken from it's Mom and then bounced around at the wedding and then to a strangers house (I'm sure your Mom would be a good dog-sitter) and then finally she/he gets to go home. That's a lot for a little puppy. <br>  I think it would be very romantic to get a little puppy collar and leash (maybe with a stuffed toy puppy) and give it to her at the reception or on the honeymoon. This way, when you get back from your honeymoon you both can read up on what breed suits your new life style and you can puppy proof your house together and buy puppy toys and your puppy bed, etc together!! Aw, I think that will be exciting for her to pick all of that stuff out with you. <br>  Hope this helps! Congrats on the up coming wedding! And have fun with your new pup!|`|lCyHJDeAaa	This is a very sweet idea, but getting a puppy on your wedding day is a HUGE responsibility at a time when you're also making huge adjustments to your life.<br>  <br>  Getting a puppy at this time will probably overwhelm you. They are a lot of work, which you might be better suited for when you're not caught up in the whirlwind of a new marriage.<br>  <br>  Trust me- my mom and her husband got a new puppy after they got married, and it's been an intense and overwhelming experience for both of them. <br>  <br>  I think you can probably figure out something just as sweet to do on your wedding day. Sorry to play devil's advocate, but I really think you should wait- you've got the rest of your lives to get a puppy!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|yFG0NhD4aa	It would be adorable, if you got the photgrapher to know about it, and meet w/ the puppy to get it familiar with you before hand (obviously).<br>    Have an open isle/area & have it bouncing  up to you guys at the end of the open spot.  Make sure he's got a cutie bow around it's neck matching the wedding colors!<br>  ...maybe to bribe it more to come to you, bring puppy treats and hide them in a plant near where you & your bride will be w/ the photographer standing waiting!<br>    And no one is saying you have to give it to her at the very beginning of the reception to worry about potty, etc.  I have had puppies, and I don't think it will care about the crowd, it will care about attention, something a crowd would give it for the last few moments at the reception.<br>    If you are worried about it getting use to your mom's house while you are away, see if you will let mom come to your guys house for a bit, and mom get it familiar w/ where it will sleep, eat, etc, over at your place.<br>    I got married 1 1/2 years ago, and sure ti was stressful, but not stressful enough to make me not want to get a puppy I was in love with, because recovering from the wedding took 2 weeks at the most (at least for me)....  <br>    I am sure you have thought this through and know what color, breed, sex, etc of dog she is looking for...you are listening to her and learning what she likes, you won't get the woman a poodle when she wanted a pug!<br>    Very sweet!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I adore this idea entirely - not only is it cute, but it's a sweet way of remembering what she once mentioned.<br>  <br>  Go for it!  She will be thrilled.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Sure, you might know she wants a puppy, but I still don't think it's a good idea to buy her one without giving her a chance to get to know it and determine she likes its personality first.  (Most reputable shelters and breeders feel the same way, so you might have trouble getting one in advance anyway.)  I say get her a stuffed dog for the reception, and promise the real thing once you get back.|`|PwHWJkcYaa	You are so sweet and adorably romantic, can I marry you?? LoL. She will adore the thought and insight you have given this and I'm sure it will give everyone something sweet to remember, also you will have a constant reminder of your love as the puppy grows. <br>  I really think this is a brilliant, original and memorable idea which your (very lucky) fiance will love.<br>  All the happiness for the future to both of you and best wishes.<br>  x|`|3WXHerN1aa	Definitely a go for!! It'd be cool 2 if u could tie the pillow on the puppy with ur wedding rings tied 2 the pillow, and have him come in with the rings.  That'd be so neato.  U work it out but definitely go for it|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Very thoughtful and very nice idea, but please don't give it to her at the reception it will be a long day for the puppy and will be a hassle for whoever is responsible for it after you give it to her. Plus that first week really is when you bond with it and make all the memories. I'm sure you will want to be there for that rather than just palm it off to the relies.<br>  I would suggest you surprise her with it when you get back from the honeymoon. When you get back it will be like you have an instant family!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I think it's an original idea.  As long as she's not particular about the exact puppy she wants, I can't find a flaw in the idea.   The extra special touch is that she won't be expecting it at all.  (Because of your snake deal.)  <br>  <br>   I got my husband a bass guitar and a really nice case on our wedding day.  It was something he needed/wanted that he had mentioned in the past.  I thought it was more us and less what people normally do.  I hope you enjoy your new puppy and your life with your soon to be wife.
yy45iAbtaa	you can go to the dep of probation and parole and get a letter of were he is residing.and that should cover all your basis.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Not to state the obvious, but you should not be acting as your own attorney in such an important case.      This can be very difficult to prove, and without an attorney, it can be difficult to get taken seriously in court.  Not fair, maybe, but true (depending on the particular judge, the crowding of their docket, the cases that were heard before yours, their own personal schedule, your demeanor and appearance, her demeanor and appearance.  Judges are not God and our system just works the way it works--attorneys are the grease on the wheels of justice).    Have you gotten social services/child protective services involved?  I recommend that you do this.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	besides hiding out and taking pics of him coming and going you can hire a detective who can probably prove where his checks go with his computer so it wont cost an arm and a leg.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Your question is a little disjointed, but I will try to see if I understand.    If you are saying that your ex has custody of your child, and her convicted sex offender of a brother lives with your former mother in law, who provides daycare for your child?    Under Megan's law, convicted sex offenders are required to register whenever they move. If this man lived in California and nowhere else, why would he register in another state, simply because he has family living there?    In the best interest of the child, you ask the Court clerk to provide you with paperwork to bring an emergency motion before the court to hold an immediate hearing regarding the best interests of the child. You may be entitled to have an attorney appointed on behalf of the child, at no charge to you. Once your ex appears in court, since you will have provided the information in the motion, namely that you are looking to have the child with you, due to the fact that the mother has knowledge that a convicted sex offender resides with the daycare provider, putting your child/children in clear and present danger.    The Judge will ask your ex point blank whether or not the brother in law is living with her mother. If she lies, she commits perjury which is a crime. The Court will also be able to subpoena the DMV and have his social security number run through the system, in the event that she does try lying. What you will request from the Judge is his or her assitance to assure that this convicted sex offender returns to California and stays away from children. If her mother has to be licensed to provide daycare, she should have her license revoked for permitting a registered sex offender to live there.
ZKsSnT64aa	Im a guy and no it does not work with me. There are too many beautiful babies out there for me to chase one whos playing games because ( since I dont read minds ) I never know if they are "playing hard to get" or seriously not interested. So I NEVER waste my time.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	there are 3 basic games, easy-to-get, hard-to-get, never-to-get, when i was in the navy we had a new female in our unit, a few guys asked her out with no luck, i figured i couldn't do worse so i tried...and the answer i got was "maybe"....maybe after maybe after maybe after maybe. i eventually gave up and stopped asking her. nobody ever asked her out again
Z4Z0IO7aaa	How many times do you need to ask this question before you take some action?|`|yhcyvBOHaa	Try to send him your love messages with attractive greetings!!|`|AA10333421	get his number from him in a casual setting, maybe after you talk to him in person a little bit. Then you could call him or text him, i kinda prefer when girls text because then you think of something to say without the awkward silence|`|HtfqFgEgaa	Wear a short dress and hand him a copy of the movie DVD "Thirteen". Then ask for his texting number. The rest is up to you.|`|ba64dc73151682548fea27893f352185aa	if you want someone to know something whats on your mind,you should be the one telling them. noone  could ever do the best for you.|`|A93gMkrxaa	SEX|`|F7OFo3nwaa	honestly, i don't think its a good idea to get the number from anyone but directly from that person. I only say that because it can lead to alot of bad results, trust me i been there! I think you should try to talk to him urself and kinda feel him out and see if there is anything there b/f you embarrass yourself.|`|wmfhtvslaa	What is funny is im going through the same thing. So im guessing u should try 2 start a conversation with him. I mean i kno u feel wack when u say certain things. But u kno wat..itz nice 2 just take a chance. That iz what im going to do. I feel the same way u feel and itz ok. Dont rush it can ruin it...but b casual and smooth: tex me bac if u need anything else |`|sxTVB14Aaa	just be ur self! let him know by not letting him know. ,ake him think ur only interested in going to a movie with him and some from friends, and trust me, he'll ask if u think u can drop the friends and make it just u two!XD good luck!|`|w8nq8cITaa	first of dont get his number from his friend. you'll look desperate. just my opinion. start of as friends and see where it goes from there. get to kno each other. nobody just goes from hello to boyfriend
AEZ75dJ7aa	Is this the same girl you talk about in all your questions?  If it is... no matter how many questions you ask and how many answers you get, the situation will be the same!  If she's getting married than just forget about her.  Until you move on with your life and find happiness in yourself you'll never find a woman that can Truly make you happy.  Maybe you should talk to the chaplain and ask him why you're addicted to this destructive girl.       I also want to say to you and all your "brothers" and "sisters" in Iraq-  THANK YOU- thank you for your sacrifice so that I can sleep in a free America tonight.  I pray for your safety daily.|`|jChbnuafaa	i wouldnt interrupt the wedding if i were you.   what is that going to do except bring attention and she would prolly be mad at you because you are ruining her wedding    tell her tomorrow! or the next day! but soon dont wait to long! dont wait till after the wedding either tell her before!    good luck if you have any other questions email me :)   -salsa|`|jyqj59W8aa	NOT AT ALL!!!!!! that is so melodramatic. tell her a day-week before her wedding if you absolutely MUST. otherwise keep it to yourself
UpQVNFYuaa	It seems like they do trust you.  Just ask them, and give them all the details.  You seem mature, because you said that you will accept it if they say no and that's a good thing.    There's no harm in asking, you might be allowed to go!  You never know if you don't ask.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Your parents will need to know, where you are going, who you are going with, how you will get there, what you will be doing when you are there, how much its going to cost, how you will get back, what time you will get back and why you want to go.  If you are prepared to answer all of these questions and more if they think of any, that shows maturity. Give them all the information they want along with phone numbers and the number of the adult person in charge, (there has to be one as its illegal for kids your age to be out on your own so far from home).  Good luck.|`|Ad0C45Ioaa	Well you seems really nice and you accept what your parents say.Which is really good.Maybe you could tell  them that you will txt them every hour to let them know you are safe.That way you wont have to ring in front of your friends.|`|b8b3f0ae3325158ca484ebd34f4ebbe2aa	Just explain who'll be going, they can phone you whenever they want and that you feel you'll be safe, and if they say no then accept it with no fuss and this will show them that you are grown up and maybe the next time they'll let you go,   It's probably not that they don't trust you, just remember your still their lttle girl and it's hard for parents to let go sometimes.   Sounds like they've done a really great job in bringing you up.
rKwpoU7Raa	You will always have feelings for your first love even if you dont want to have them. The reason you are flirting with other guys is because there may be something you are lacking from your boyfriend that you want and need from him. The best thing to do is to ask him how he feels about you if he gives you the answer you want to hear then it's worth working out. If not then it's time to move on. The magic you felt with your first you will probally not find with anyone else that was a special moment in your life when you first fell in love.|`|evmzwbyHaa	Maybe your not in LOVE with your current boyfriend your jUst use to him being around.if your ex hurt yOu why would u want anything to do with him?he might jUst do it again,but true u will always  have something in your heart for your first love,jUst remember how good your current boyfriend treats you,.dOn't leave the one yOu love for the one yOu like bcus then the one yOu like will leave yOu for the one he loves,get it?  And every couple argues but try and reason with him.guys can be extremely hard headed,|`|FKf67HXaaa	Your first love will always have that effect on you because its your first love. like you will always get butterflies in stomach when you see him or are around him, but you will not feel this way when you find the man you want to be with forever.|`|IbbQK960aa	If he was a keeper you would have kept him. Keep looking you will find magic when you least expect it. good luck|`|UtwMxaPzaa	Those are very common pre-breakup symptoms. You have to decide what you want, or you will hurt your bf very much.|`|5akokd0Faa	its normal to feel magic with your first love. maybe you and this guy are just not meant for eachother|`|aL0uWmSLaa	well what i have to say is that don't worry about the arguing because every healthy couple will tell u that arguing is absolutely normal and about your ex since he was the first guy u loved he still has a piece of u with him and what u should do is learn to forget about the guy and try to remember how u and him had that spark and get that spark into your current relationship and i'm sure things will work out great for the two of u    Hope i could help :)
VxW3bAjzaa	Find a non-slob to replace him with.
SmzzXJlRaa	no idea what bubble is...  grinding is easy tho - just stick ur butt out to his dick (haha sorry for that image but its weird to explain) and move ur hips side to side and like forward and backward randomly. the forward and backward thing turns him on more and yea u should be able to feel his dick on ur butt. but then hes gonna put his arms around ur waist kinda and hold ur hands and u hold his hands and like hold them on the side of ur hips right above ur vag hahahaha sorryyy but u asked.
AA10905383	I'm sorry you have to deal with a father like that. There isn't a whole lot you can do, that I know of. You can try to avoid him when he's there. Tell your mom you don't want to spend time with him because he says hurtful things. If talking to him does nothing, then just cut off communication.     If he doesn't want a son, then don't try and act like one.  I'm really sorry you have to deal with that. That's awful.
dGL5xCrqaa	My first boyfriend told me I was quiet. It was his way of trying to break that barrier to attempt to make me more comfortable with him.    I wouldn't take it personally, it's either him teasing like my ex boyfriend did, or he's just Captain Obvious.    If you like him back, and you're sure he likes you, then I wouldn't worry about it.    Good luck.|`|O6TC4CgRaa	well, he was just being honest. He didn't means to hurt your feeling or anything, he's just want you to be comfortable around him.|`|umFYCgtAaa	He probably wants to talk to you more... dont take it the wrong way, if you like him then start talking.|`|IOQMcp2Naa	he probably just wants to talk to you a bit more than what you are at the minute
Tp4jFDWdaa	I'm going through the same thing. No one is there to talk to me, and when they're there, they only pretend to listen and say, "I'm sorry". It bottles up anger that I express through something I love: poetry. It helps that on Y!A, people you don't even KNOW listen to you.   I cope by (like I said before) poetry. Sometimes I cry at night and you know what? I think it's OK to let loose. Go ahead and cry and don't be ashamed about it.   I have 1 single friend that I have that I can talk to, but the parents don't want us to be friends anymore. I cope with that by talking to my other friend that I was really never close to but am close to now.   Sometimes you just have to make the best out of it. There are hotlines you can call toll free regarding this stuff, though I usually don't recommend it.|`|QHx95iZDaa	Yes i feel the same sometimes because every is on your case all the time|`|qwveESAFaa	Everyone feels depressed once in a while.  And everyone feels alone sometimes.  But if this continues, please tell your mom, school guidance counselor, a favorite teacher, or someone you can trust.    You might need to see a doctor for antidepressants if this continues.    But before that, talk to your friends and find out why you think they have abandoned you.  Have you been nice to them?|`|AA11447210	Most people get blue from time to time and may feel alone or lonely. Realize that your life is what you make of it and others aren't there to "make" you happy or provide you with a reason to live or have fun.    Take charge of your life and do things you want to do. Rekindle your friendships or make new ones. Get out and be active...maybe do volunteer work. That might help you feel needed and have a purpose, not to mention give you the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends.    Hang in there...life has its ups and downs. If not for the downs, we'd never appreciate the ups appropriately. ?
ZuRjSHq2aa	Not a turn off but more of "she doesnt like me" most guys will walk away from a girl who shows no interest because theyll seem creepy. If you dont show that your intersted by either staring back or smiling or playing with hair or something they wont know you like them back and they probably wont try to approach you unless theyre deeply infatuated or crazy. Being professional is good but if your off of work and still like that then you might learn to flirt a bit more. |`|EWGHnH4Daa	Probably a turn on. You obviously respect yourself and don't play the stupid games, which everyone likes. Those are also two good qualities for someone who is "girlfriend material." Unfortunately though, guys are idiots and may take this as a sign that you aren't interested. So when/if you find a guy you like you'll probably have to make the first moves. Just tell him how you feel about him, and that you are reserved and not a flirt. He'll like it.|`|uDLHeWgNaa	Some men find it attractive and some not but if someone is flirting with you and you like them you should at least talk to them.|`|XN15iFxqaa	well if you keep to yourself its just alot harder to talk to you,.. <br>  <br>  its not really a turn off or turn on.|`|zA34N6Jwaa	You're fine, we don't care about that. Turn the tables, however, and it's a completely different story. I've been an introverted person ever since I can remember being a conscious being, and because there is this unspoken expectation for men to approach women - dating is hell for me.|`|NVHq2tTeaa	i think it would be a turn off.<br>  If you dont even give them a hint that you like them there gonna stop and move on.|`|a1a739e810bd7bc6b538272fa49d82c5aa	just be urself, guys will follow.|`|1PdUecpYaa	some guys are more attracted to  that type of girls.. don't worry too much.<br>  i'm usually reserved too.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Most will go for the flirts....
8cuPVvYnaa	In a sense. I had a best friend growing up. We were so close. Sometimes we'd hug and tell each other how much we loved each other, and my heart would feel such love. But it was not sexual. I think nowadays there seems to be an increase in bisexual relationships. If I was growing up now I wonder if I would have wondered if I am bi? I think it would be very easy to mistake deep love for someone as an indication of one's sexual orientation. Love is boundless and should have no restrictions. But when it comes to sexuality we should not be quick to let our emotions lead us.|`|7THgBSvfaa	I believe it..|`|XTy7mLAkaa	Nope, sorry.  I believe love is to be between a man and a woman only.  Anything else is just weird and wrong.    But, if it's like brotherly or sisterly love, yeah that's fine but two women and two men in a relationship, having sex and all... nah, that's gross.|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Sounds like the movie The Crying Game to me. I can understand what you mean by that and that particular movie explained that concept pretty well. Still I don't believe it's true. ';-)|`|YawdUnRKaa	I surely do.  I'm not gay, I don't plan on being gay, but I mean, surely no one can believe that love flourishes for everyone between a man and a woman because for them it obviously does not. Love knows no gender, no race, no social status, no distance, no last name, nor religon. Love just is. If love had a preference, there would never be beautiful love stories we hear so much about, forcing love between what you think is right, isn't love. Sorry, accept it, Love has no preference, it falls where it may.|`|xmK56dIXaa	I think it's true. Someone knows what they believe, and what's right for them is what's right for them, it doesn't need to be for everyone else. If it's what makes their life special, then tell me, who are we to criticize what is good or not for them? Yes, that quote is perfectly fine.|`|Kw5T7XEfaa	Yeah..  theres no reason why a guy cannot like a guy.. and theres no reason why a girl cant like a girl.  As long as they are truely in love and are happy   thats all that matters  =)
UMHEAQaGaa	well i had a similar problem and we all liked this guy a lot not to mention he was like one of my best friends .. but anyway i realised that no matter how much you want him to like you, even if he does at some point is he really worth it? you should be with someone who will fully appreciate you...even if it's really hard- you need to try and either move on or talk to your friends and explain how you feel...cause the last thing you'll want is a fight over some guy   hope this helps =]|`|VJlUpfjBaa	Get over it. He's just a boy. You should be focusing on getting through school not guys. Worry about guys after you've got a diploma. This way you're only dealing with boys that you could potentially spend your life with, not wasting your time on flings.
j7SGTA3saa	My opinion is that she's confused as much as u r and that's y she is has not been acting normal since the kiss thing, I don't know where u want things to go from here but    If u want to keep ur friendship, keep it cool, don't mention the kiss subject unless ur friend brings it up but keep ur cool and don't show signs of wanting ur friendship to change. After all u don't wanna make any fast decisions that will hurt ur feelings, ur friends or her boyfriends altogether.    U can also talk to her and go straight to the point saying I really need to know wat's going on so I'm clear. Ask wat her feelings truly are towards u and be ready to hear the truth and to tell her the truth about how u feel. Be clear so ur not confused about were u both stand.|`|7oKBEKAVaa	She's shy and worried that you didn't want it to happen. You might have said you enjoyed it, but she's probably embarrassed. Talk to her about it, more in depth. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact that she kissed someone that wasn't her boyfriend and she's ashamed, too. Ask her why she's changed, if it has anything to do with the circumstances, etc. I've done this sort of thing, too, and I stopped talking because I felt like a horrible person for 1. cheating on my BF and 2. leading another boy on. I'm not her so I don't know what SHE thinks, just talk to her about it and don't let her skirt the issue or change subjects. It might be awkward, but it's awkward to talk now, too, isn't it?|`|cnxHLP41aa	She likes you.. she needs someone like you... but she is committed with her b/f , you have to wait until anything happend ... who can tell... keep going... don't worry.|`|1oGBByMIaa	NO|`|YKbiJADQaa	You gave her an emotion of disgust. So she didn't want to the be the onyl one who did enjoy it. So if you said to her I loved it and want to see her again and talk about it, she would have had a more intriguing thing to say back. She likes you for sure|`|A0r2qWaHaa	Wow, that is random!  Don't worry about it!  She might feel a little embarrassed or nervous so just give her time to start talking to you again.  It was her decision to kiss you so don't worry about it.  Let the chips fall where they may!  She probably has a crush on you!|`|uFfOSIQzaa	she probably feels guilty for cheating on her bf, thats y shes not talking (tbh mate, if theyve been dating for a year i think u need 2 tell the guy that shes cheated.) u shuld have pushed her away when she initiated the kiss!! she sounds like a stuck up person whod kiss any bloke just for a laff, so if it does turn out she likes u, id turn her down, no matter how much u like her. If she can cheat on a guy that shes been going out with for well over a year (so id guess theyre pretty head over heels in love) then think how easily shed cheat on you. nd id say exactly that if i were you. sorry dude, dnt mean 2 be so harsh but this girl sounds like a right *****|`|JQarjZBDaa	she likes u but shes just embarassed becuz she thought u would like her kiss but now she thinks u dont so she thinks u have a problem with it or somthing uhhmmm ya just tell her u liked it or shes a good kisser or somthing
AA11309778	A pervert is someone who looks at you and imagines that you are naked. He can also be described as someone who is single and looks at porn all the time.

Never give him specifics about yourself, your body, your family etc. If he is a pervert he will look for ways to connect with you on a personal level. If he is a pervert he will not be very patient.

Whats normal now a days anyway.|`|AA10704538	breathes|`|a12b64e8c073dca76f0a432c61f1a87aaa	A pervert is the type of person that gives you that creepy hand standing on end nauseated feeling.  There is something about him that rubs you the wrong way.  The way he talks, the way he walks, the way he stares at you like you would go for him in a heartbeat, all the while you know you need to get as far away from him as possible.  You don't need a large chest for him to stare at you there as he slobbers.  You could be 40 pounds over your goal weight, and he would still try to grab your butt. The only way to get rid of him is to get someone you know  to kick him to the curb physically, or to grab his hair, and slam his head into the bar.    Hopefully this kind of info helps.  Here's hoping you don't meet up with this type of guy.|`|AA12377184	Spank his monkey in public|`|AA11457042	Lets define pervert, a pervert, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I like sex (don't we all?) but am not a pervert. My ex-wife is a disgusting **** but, is not a pervert. A real pervert is one who desires and carries out fantasies of unnatural acts, such as bestiality and homosexuality. Neither of these is sex as it was intended but a perverse deviation of the original intention.  Thus the term pervert.|`|AA11724307	Touch other girls sexually, make sexual comments, watch alot of porn and go to alot of strip clubs.|`|AA10364780	ummmmmm ...when he acts like a pervert|`|AA11206105	Enjoys Sodomy|`|AA12273681	touch you in private placecs or touch himself a lot, talk a lot about sex or porn, say random stuff like "im horny"...|`|AA11972404	He makes you feel uncomfortable.

L'homme, toute le temps propre sur lui, galant, dlicat, prsent, fort et attentionn a t tu par les femmes et leurs exigences. Il n'est pas facile d'tre un pre prsent, un amant formidable, un fonceur dans les affaires,  bati comme un Apollon. Alors que la contrepartie est bien mince.|`|AA11055594	Car c'est stupide!|`|3aef73a0773bd7d0600ad39eec2d9941aa	parce qu'une bonne fois pour toute , le prince charmant n'existe pas !!!!!!! c'est une histoire qu'on raconte aux petites filles.  Je pense qu'a la limite l'expression "rencontrer son pre No?l"  serait moins na?ve . si si il en existe , ils roulent souvent en porche , ferrari etc ...   D'une part ?a colle une pression pas possible , tre beau , intelligent , riche et patati et patata. On est donc forcment oblig de vous dcevoir. et d'autre part ?a prouve de votre part une exigence qui est incompatible avec notre demande de simplicit.    Et ?a fait franchement nunuche !|`|848b19819567ebf2859191669d63a2b6aa	Parce que ?a fait nunuche ... tout simplement  Trop romantique...trop moux   c'est pas tres viril !!!|`|c9caec28f05e82b107755487c821d129aa	Parce qu'ils ne sont pas charmant, les filles rvent plus, elles sont plus m?res et on moins peur..|`|79fb44c1beb1afa4cb441f3f187ec45daa	car ?a fait petite fille qui ne pense qu'aux contes de fes. il fo dire rencontrer l'homme idale ?a fait plus femme

Tell her that even though you value the friendship you two have you don't have those kind of feelings for her. How she takes that isn't your fault because you rejected her in the nicest possible way.

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING A LOT SOONER!!!  |`|byjAYzllaa	I was 15 when I started having sex and I see nothing wrong with it. I do not regret the time, however I do regret the man. I have never had any emotional problems from choosing to have sex when I did and I feel i was completely ready for it. However I wish I had been with some one else. Be careful who you choose!|`|EJW0lLvaaa	When i had my first kiss i was in grade 9, so i was about 13... then i started doing a little more and a little more,, i never had sex until i was 17, almost 18... i don't really regret it but the guy is being such a d**k lately that it is almost hard not to regret it but i dont because its what i wanted at the time|`|WSfrBTeJaa	The summer between freshman and sophomore year in high school was my first really sexual relationship. <br>  I never slept with the guy, but we made out...a lot.<br>  And he touched me...a lot.<br>  Anyways, I don't really regret it, but I wish I had done those things with someone I loved more...<br>  :/|`|1HaIomBcaa	I started making out in 9th grade, and moved to feeling around (over clothes) that same year.

aIEkNM0Paa	you should ask her 1 week before so its not weird when you give her a gift on valentine..|`|0utZQuyeaa	Why not do it on valentines day :D?    Or, if you're not comfortable doing that or just would like to wait, see what her response is to the gift you give her on valentines day. If she seems pleased or seems to like you, I'd do it a bit after valentines day. Doesn't matter if its a couple days or even a week.    If she feels that its akward or whatever, maybe the feeling isn't mutual for her. But because you already got her a gift, you must have a vibe that she likes you.    But yeahh, deffies wait 'til after valentines day.    BC if she rejects you (which she probably won't) before valentines day, then you won't be able to give her the lovely gift you've picked out for her.    :]] Good luck. ;D  xo|`|1kQLOxpAaa	As a girl, I would love to be asked the day before V-day, and then get the super swee gift ON V-day. The reason being, most guys try to avoid getting gifts for girls on v-day, so to be asked the day before shows that you're not afraid of big "love" days. Then, she will probably think she's not getting a gift because you just started dating, a card at the most, and then BANG, super sweet gift!! EVERY friend of her's will be so freaking jealous.|`|c5501d7af062f728e28883d70bec4816aa	how about ON valentines day ?? wouldn't that be perfect? :)  answer mine please  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|cHM2US6xaa	Well ON valentines day would be very nice.    Is there any reason you don't want to ?    Well if so, then one day before.

AA11963700	Give him a braslet he will always wear keeping in mind that it will keeping reminding him about you.|`|bBxl1XDraa	I think you should buy him something that every time he looks at it it will remind him of you. Nothing like clothes we give and throw those away along with shoes. Maybe try something from a engravement  store like a pillow or a big throw with your name or words of love engraved on it,you know something from the heart. Nothing 2 expensive because you guys are young and you have not been dating that long.|`|71Flc0Exaa	what is he in to?get him some of his fav music or if hes into sports...get him something in that line.for example...if he likes hockey...get him a jersey or a new hockey stick.if he likes say t-pain...get a t-pain cd or a mix cd.hope this helps.|`|0nV3osTbaa	well if he likes sports get him something of his favorite team.|`|YEJq8GR8aa	instead of getting him something take him somewhere that he likes to go that you don't usually go to, or just ask one of his friends what he was going to get him and get him that same gift before his friend gives it to him : )|`|1Pma0Xgpaa	Ohh<br>  its okay dont panic the best thing to do his ask his mate for advice not his closest one though he might tell him.|`|4dd97ec99931462bd19ac0042819ca17aa	gt him some gaget or sme thing which he likes to use a lot bt is nt with him|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	maybe you can get him a really nice shirt that he might like the material or color on his skin. <br>  <br>  my kids like really soft light materials for their short or long sleeved tees.  or if you know of a band that he likes...get a tee with the band logo or such.|`|e660599bdaf645434b5d8eb381d1129aaa	aww....dat reminded me of my ex....<br>  v r 16 2..<br>  neway, i bot him a wrist watch...<br>  but couldnt gv him since v broke off...so i threw away dat thing...<br>  if he lyks soccer get him smthin related to dat..<br>  or a tie of a nice formal shirt...or a casual 1..
NrbLdZzOaa	You just need practice. Try finding a guy that you connect with either in person or online and talk with him.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	I hate to give you such a dumb answer, but do you honestly think that a 14 or 15 year old boy is comfortable talking to you? At that stage in life, we're all covered in acne, and our voices crack. You're just as afraid of him as he is of you. Talk about a tv show or something, or how stupid mr. teacher looks in that pink shirt... When you two start to make each other laugh, you'll find the words come out much MUCH easier. You just need to relax. It's only life, and you'll never make it out alive anyway.
MRUuRTHeaa	Just say it!  I mean, don't just blurt it out, but maybe if your having a conversation that is on the topic, you could just say, "You know what, you really encourage me, help me out etc.,..and I admire you for that."|`|dO5D1zhkaa	Give her one of those random friendship cards you see at hallmark and send it to her. Good friends appreciate things like that.

fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	No gift basket...to impersonal, thats what you get for a teacher or something! haha Dinner and a movie is nice (make sure its a movie HE wants to see...even if its one you don't want to see). Cooking him a dinner would be a fun thing too...if you own your own place, be wearing something REALLY sexy when he gets there and be cooking him a dinner...he will be in heaven!!|`|yFG0NhD4aa	  I agree w/ him above... the dinner thing would be cool.  If he lives alone & you can get into his place, decorate with candles around, dim lit...dress something attractive to him w/ a fancy apron (is that stupid?!, I'm picturing heels, in the kitchen (don't trip) and  a black lacy apron?).<br>    If you can't get into his place, have him come to your place.  If he plans to go home before he sees you, decorate his door w/ cut out hearts, streamer, ballon and hang some cornie little stuffed animal on his doorknob.<br>    Who knows if you guys will make it to the movie at that point, but, movie in, or out, set pillows and blankets on the floor to snuggle on the floor for movie in.

Find a boy who goes to your school and call it a day with the other guy.  <br>  <br>  Or better yet, be by yourself for a bit, figure out what you really want and what will make you happy in a relationship.  I'd bet it isn't being with a boy that you never get to see.|`|zNqOc8lBaa	YES!|`|li6nGXpKaa	you are to young to be in love little girl. just be a kid and forget all that love stuff....get an education and make LOTS of money so u won't have to relay on any man~!
9xNRMi5taa	I think it takes a lot of guts to be who you are no matter who thinks what, so I think you will make someone really happy.

Xx XD|`|Aky5JKQEaa	sounds like you hurt her feelings,  she is being hard on you cause i think because she don't wanta get hurt.  give her some time and keep being nice and see how it goes.  my belief is people can't shut their feelings off like that they just dont want to get hurt. hope i help good luck to you sweetie.|`|IYwBH1A0aa	thats an obvious sign of break up. communication tells all. so call her and be like, whats up? so talk to her. find out whats runnin threw her mind. but personally, this relationship sounds like its not gonna last very long.|`|5EUO9Nuzaa	not really sure of your point, but to answer your question... no she does not love you.  There are a zillion people on this planet, go find one you get along with and one that doesn't play little silly games.|`|eqyIxmMaaa	in my honest opinion... she found another guy, and u need to move on. forget about her man! hang out with ur friends, and forget about girls for awile.|`|U5pDHlXHaa	um...yeah.|`|nZ6kd1GKaa	i really dont know|`|AA10688082	i think her feeling's fading away. you might want to work hard to get bak to her if not....ur gonna be exchanged|`|fXnvfK4baa	dang dawg she doing you wrong all ova.. she wont even call u star, this my (opinion), i think since you gonna be busy on your college thing, she meeting some one else an doen it on tha low.. because no matta how much a girl hate you, they aint gonna wanna stop callen you tha little sweetheart names an stop being there for you.. as far as the ''love thing'', i think she do but its like maybe 20% she still love you if she doen all that to you.. man love is a m0th@fucka.. but if your willen to keep trying then go for it, BUT KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HER IF U STILL WANT THE RELATIONSHIP!!!!

If you are thinking to KEEPING this woman for marriage then love doesn't seem to fit the equation. You either love her and want to marry her or you don't. If you don't love her with your heart go away and leave her alone.
AA11541125	If you think he is cheating, you need to confront him. Don't waste your time thinking about it. It won't do anything but stress you out.    The sure fire way to know is to pray. Say: Father, I ask that if ________ is doing anything in secret, let it be brought out to the light because you said in your word the whatever is done in the dark will come out into the light. Amen.    I did this prayer on my husband and he didn't get any rest until he told me what he was hiding. By praying this way, it released the urge to try to find out something on my own, and have peace in knowing that if he was doing anything, God would reveal it.    Prayer works!.|`|AA11808963	You should try to talk to him and tell him. If he is a good boyfriend, he will understand and talk to you more. If he is liking and flirting with that other girl just break up with him he's not good enough for you.|`|AA11212357	get out! there is no since in wasting your time if you are unhappy. its fun to be single..until someone else comes along...they always do, its inevitable, the world is huge.|`|b4931459c15dc8631bcb3132775c53c3aa	if he comes home smelling funny or has girls number in his pockets.|`|AA11310229	Confront him about it....|`|a3de37b95dd7946cc08ffc8d7e124630aa	let him know that you are uncomfortable with the extra time spent with her. ask if he is being unfaithful.  let him know that if he is into someone else thered is no use in dragging out this false relationship with eachother.  he shouldn't waste your time and life or his.
p4R1c6fraa	It means there is a level of attraction.How do you not know this?<br>  <br>  Always take things slow and get to know a person.Now go call her.|`|6f4d4b3eec91cb01f82f7fc6f1cca9bdaa	depends how long youve known each other.|`|178e2b995ae3e272fa1715ebb2800842aa	Nope, just like a used car salesman. They say they care about you, try to get you a better deal than the competitor but bring to the tables the same bland garbage that the other used car salesmen can get you. They always want you to call, they give you their number. It only shows desperation for the vehicle (relationship) and they snag you and reel you in for all your worth, hang you up to dry and move on to the next customer (relationship). There are some on the other hand that tend to represent the honest salesman, they get to know you, they talk...not just about the dumbass vehicle but what you want in the vehicle (relationship), they want to get the sale no matter what but are reasonable and understanding of your budget and your lifestyle. Same with a relationship if the girl and you actually got to talking and maybe got to know each other a little bit or the time wasn't right and either you or her were in a rush to talk more and just gave a number to meet another (better) time. Then yeah you have a shot at a great relationship, but you have to take it for a test drive and see how it rides out (relationship).|`|w4l8NajJaa	NO not entirely, i mean its a good sign that she gave you her number but it doesnt mean that she wants to go out with you right away it means that shes interested. I suggest texting her and then work your way from there. Hang out more and see if she's interested then when you feel like its the right time ask her out : )<br>  Good luck!|`|d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	It's always best to be friends because then you have a much stronger relationship if you find that you have common interests.  <br>  <br>  Possibly?  I don't know why don't you just ask her out on a date?  You could get to know more if you don't enough about her as a friend.  I would start off as friends and then see if it goes in that direction first.|`|oRdHPdUFaa	it's not a definate sure sign, but it does mean your chances are really good!|`|z8DpH1vdaa	Sure! A girl wouldn't go through all that effort to talk to you then give you her number if she didn't'  want to go out on a date with you. Call her up, and ask her out what are you waiting for?

I'm a girl looking for my Romeo|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Your 17 years old....... People who are over 30 still cant find their "Romeo or Juliet"|`|AIftgLEGaa	relax, and be yourself. The reason you haven't found her yet is because there is only one special girl for you. You just haven't found her yet. As long as you stay true to yourself and your emotions, she will appear.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Everyone wants that. Good luck, sir!    You are also trying too hard. You can't pick out a girl like you would a pretty flower and be like, "You will be my ideal woman." Maybe a few centuries ago, but not anymore. Oh, sure, things we're much simpler in the days of ye cavemen when all a guy had to do was bash her over the head with a club and drag her back to his cave.    Relax and be yourself and you will be much happier with your relationships. You'll probably have many and if you're looking for marriage material at age 17 that will FREAK chicks out. You think that's what women want b/c of movies and shows like "Sex and the City"?? Those chicks are all in their 30s, not their teens.|`|AA11425983	wow,  wish I knew you too|`|5fjbNeVNaa	First off, you spelled Juliet wrong...see...1 T.     Secondly, you keep looking you will never find that person you are looking for. Stop looking and live life and you will find a girl like that|`|uOPExDRmaa	who are youuuuu  i feel the same exact way.I'm turning 17 and I'm lookin for that romeo too...  so you help me, I don't know what to say to this....|`|xDMNPXE2aa	i believe that love will find you. just keep your eyes open to alll the girls you meet and which ones coplete you and make you feel good about yourself.|`|s1oDY9Tfaa	Be patient, because you will find her eventually. A when you do, she will be the luckiest girl in the world to have such a sweet guy like you! But don't settle for anything less. Wait until it feels perfect. You sound like a really nice guy, so beware of girls taking advantage of you.|`|eZZ2rclaaa	We are in the same boat. I'm looking for my Romeo. I just ended a 7 month relationship because he was not my Romeo. Love is sad and tough but when you find that right girl, you will know. Just keep looking. Keep your head held high even through the toughest times. And remember, your only 17!! You should be out having fun with your friends! Life is too short to be extremely serious. Remember and do these 3 important things of life and there is no doubt you won't have fun- live, laugh, love.|`|PSzZen5Maa	Read     The Game.

Of course, then you take the chance that they will get mad or sad anyway. Just do what you want to do.|`|R7Joj5xzaa	if all 3 of you are best friends then you could have them both come to your house for a party and bring other people along.    other option is to go to one house until half time and then go to the other one for the other part.    another option is to just go to the house of the person that asked you first and tell the other one you are busy that day    last option is that you could just not go to either party and just watch it at home.|`|zfrPmiFtaa	Call them both and tell them that the other asked too.

See who has the bigger television and bigger house. Then ask them to throw one BIG Super Bowl party. That way you're helping one of them out, and everyone's happy.|`|8hv4eHcyaa	go to the one who asked u first|`|8eW46eMqaa	Come to my house (and bring them both with you)!|`|0FKMqJIYaa	My advice is to find out who has the bigger TV or better snacks or whatever.  You can use this as a reason you chose one place over the other when you tell your other friend.  If one friend isn't having a big get together, invite them with you to the other house, but make sure to ask the host first!

DO5VlnRVaa	How about a box of candy and some flowers, nooot!!! (Maybe on the seventh date or something). He should eat there again and talk to her and tell her that he thinks it is really nice of her that she didnt charge him anything and that he wants to invite her for a drink/coffee for that. And then her reaction decides the rest. Of course just if your friend is single, because if not he can just give her a huge tip next time...
Cd35I5Ciaa	What kind of relationship do your bf and his grandmother have?  Is she overbearing to him, controlling, or does she appreciate your relationship with him?  You need to find this out before you agree to this.  I am not saying that it is a bad idea at all, just that if you move in with her, and she spoils him too much, you may get defensive about that.  If you think you could handle that, than you will not have a problem.  If she is the kind of g'mother who can mind her own business and leave you two alone to do your own thing once in awhile, you could have a wonderful experience with her.<br>  Good luck, and I hope everything works out great!!!|`|AA10097049	how is g-maws health as that is the big thing that I see but other than that if there is enough room go for it|`|Po86wnLAaa	yes go for it .the whole economy is struggling and if you have this chance go for it .and its olny 6 months its noit forever .and it well help you save your money and give your relationship a test think of it like that .its an experience and thats how we learn .i would go for it.and hey a grandma can tell u about her grandson cute stories .you can make a bond with her and that would be great foe ur bf to c|`|pdfAPWqIaa	just pay bills?

The end result can't be good in a situation like this, though, there shouldn't be a problem with age, considering that such an age difference is only a couple of years.  There must be other things that are bothering your parents.  Try talking to them calmly this time, and don't put up the defensive immediately.

W840msNTaa	well its seems your really like this girl and she would be the perfect girlfriend and it seems she might like you back. But she's with another guy. If she liked u enough she would drop her bf and get with u. <br>  <br>  I would move on and check out other ppl but still keep this girl in mind. Don't waste your time going after this girl who u can't get with because she a bf. I would go after other girls and try to get another girlfriend and if this girl becomes available go after her again. But don't waste your time trying to get a girl thats already taken. But remember to continue being friends with this girl so it is easier to start a relationship with her later and because it makes u happy to be with her.

How can you say that they are trashy if you're single, but if you're not, it's justified? That makes no sense whatsoever.

LJDiSCCNaa	no. I have a 29 year old sister in law who has literally faked so many abdominal pains, she has gotten on so many pain drugs that her mind is deteriorating and is a total pain in the *** to everyone around her.

Her best tactic tho is putting her on medications that make her sleep all day.
AA12349214	Okay.  Look at it this way.  You are going out with a girl that you really love and in the background is this guy that is sending her flowers and cards and making it known how he feels about her - he is in effect trying to steal her away.    How would you feel?    There's your answer.    You just have to wait until she is free I'm afraid.|`|	Tell her.|`|	give her a card ''as a joke..if it goes wrong!''

Well if i were you i would send an anonymous card, so that she know somebody other than her Boyfriend loves her. She will be curious. Although you might really want to send roses, i wouldnt. It could ruin their relationship. Just send her a card, to give her a heads up. Then when she gets single, lay all the love on her with roses and such.    Hope this helps. :)|`|	Lol, be teh dude that jumps in teh moment theres something wrong with their relationship.|`|	Sorry, but the only thing you can do is walk away.  I've been in the same situation before (more than once), and the only way you can avoid getting hurt is to stop being her friend.  She doesn't love you, she isn't going to leave her boyfriend for you, and anything you do to try so change that is just going to make you look like a stalker!|`|	Hm that's a complicated situation! But hey if she has a BF & isn't giving him up for you...Are you really sure she loves you enough? Me, I'd doubt that. No offense.

Yeah maybe send her flowers or something, it would be really sweet. But just do what feels right. Good luck, hope it goes well......|`|	ok so if you wanna get her anything for valentines it has to be something that doesnt offend her boyfriend becasue right there that could start a fight that could end up with you losing her as a friend.    if you are good friends like you say you are then one day at the right moment (not planned or anything just a normal hang out day) ask her questions about her love life with this other guy. try and dig deep to figure out if she is really happy. girls love when a guy actually cares to ask and make sure that she is happy especially when he is being sincere and doesnt seem like he is trying to get something out of her.     make sure she knows that no matter what, you are a true friend and that you love her and you would do anything to protect her. dont act like mushy or like you WANT her but just be REAL and loving in a good way.   with time she will either see that you are the only guy on this planet for her and she cant be happy with anyone else or..... she will see that you are the truest best friend she could ever have. both places are VERY special in a girls heart. most likely though she will realize its you ( if you are truely being sincere and you truely love her as a friend first)

After not changing my clothes and not bathing for several weeks, it all changed. Instead of smiling, low and behold....they frowned with disapproval.

I used the reason of feeling sorry for the abusers had more than one.

No one can make you feel inferior without your permission!  So dont give him the permission!  Whether or not you trust anyone again is entirely up to your free will.  You can literally choose to trust or not.  Its all down to you and how strong you can be.  Dont take it out on your little sister.  She didnt ask to be born.  She probably loves you and I bet deep down you love her - so protect her, love her and see that she has a good life.  All big brothers should protect their little sisters.  She is no different.  Dont blame your mother either, who knows how any of us would act walking a mile in another persons shoes.  Just acknowledge that you had a horrible childhood and resolve to break the cycle and make the rest of your life upbeat, happy and positive.  No one else can do that for you but you.  Dont sweat the small stuff, let the stuff you cant do anything about go like a balloon up into the air and just get on with your life thankful that the destructive influence is no longer there.

You history is not your destiny, to quote a talk show host.  I think for sure you should find a good counselor who you can tell all of this stuff to. Does your school have a counseling office? Your church?  BTW - we're all selfish **** at times. It's not what you feel, it's how you act. Act now to start feeling better about yourself and your chances to be a great person.  Good luck, friend.|`|d7vyYNLQaa	just forget about it|`|mWWQR2lIaa	you are not him at all.  firstly because you actually care about your mum.  please give your mum a break she has been through alot even though what she done, she is a single parent.  you need sit down and talk to youe mum, explain exactly how feel,   i understand why you are resentful to your sister but she cant help it can she?  also i think a counsellor is a good idea, get some help getting over this.     good luck.|`|g3XVcRJGaa	Sometimes people just need time, but if a long amount of time has passed and you still can't trust people find someone to talk to and go to counseling. It helps, even if it does take a long time.|`|ye9h5jXvaa	The fact that you're aware of this stuff and asking these questions shows that you know he's wrong and that you're not selfish or anything else he said you were. The worst thing you can do is start believing what he said, because it's simply not true. It sounds like you were an easy target for him to blame, which shows what kind of a person he was, but don't believe him. It must have been a horrible experience and sadly nothing can change that, but remember it's over now. That's one positive thing. It will take time to deal with something like this and there's no easy quick fix, I'm afraid. Try not to blame your sister, though. It's not her fault. She didn't ask to be born, after all. If you need to direct your anger or hatred at someone it would be best to lay it on him, since he caused this.    The best way to deal with something like this is to talk about it with someone else. They'll help you see other viewpoints and different ways of looking at things. Right now you can only see it from your own point of view, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Find someone you can trust and explain the situation and tell them how you feel, or if you don't know anyone suitable perhaps arrange to see a doctor or counsellor - someone who will take you seriously and listen to your problems. Dealing with the after-effects of a traumatic experience by yourself isn't a good idea. It's easy to get depressed and become trapped in your ways of thinking. Everything seems much worse than it is if you let it get on top of you like that, so please talk to someone. Remember that however bad things were you've still got the rest of your life ahead of you, and you can make it what you want. Good luck. I hope you'll be okay.
AA12260828	Why did you two break up? You might actually not have feelings for HIM but you might be missing the comfort of being in a relationship. Are you just lonely?     Sit down and sort out your feelings. If you both broke up for a good reason (not compatible, abusive relationship, etc...) you're both better off and you're probably just missing the feeling of being in a relationship and you're lonely.     He seems to have moved on quite quickly, so what does that tell you about how he feels about you?|`|J3iBuHAHaa	First of all, your "friend" is going against all girl codes ever written. I'm posative she knows that deep down inside you're totally not okay with them talking. That was a really B*tchy move of her. You need to tell her strait up that you don't like them seeing eachother, or else it will eat at you and bother you and stress you out;believe me. Honestly the only way you're going to completely get over your ex, is to see and experience other people. I know it is hard, and it will take time for your heart to heal, but if you guys aren't meant to be, then you won't be, and you shouldn't miss out on other oppourtunities and let your old feelings hold you back.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	Nothing.

She definitely won't if you don't ask. Having feelings for your ex is normal, they'll go away eventually.

Is she concerned about how she looks?  She doesn't have to be skinny but has to show that she cares about how she looks.  I personally love a humble, sweet personality.  The girl that acts like a man is a turn-off.  I love femininity, vulnerability, kindness, politeness and all the things that make a woman different from a man.|`|oZdMcksMaa	I always liked girls who are polite, no trash talking, feminine, caring, sweet, and shy. She MUST be smart. I want to carry an intelligent conversation with her.    As for looks..well, ive always liked: Eyes with a stare you can't forget, white skin or naturally colored skin(I HATE the fake hollywood/beach tan thing alot of girls are getting these days. The fake blonde hair and the...orangish skin....UGH)A pretty face, a cute smile, a good body(doesn't have to be fit, but dont want it to be fat either), boobs dont matter much to me, im more of a legs man.

Actually, stop talking to him in general for now. Wait until you're over him before you attempt a friendship. If you must spend time with him, bring other people along. Or go to a public place. Get a hobby/new friend (not a new boyfriend) so you have something to focus on besides this guy.|`|3ctchU2faa	Tell him you either need him to commit to you and try again or you have to move on. Sex with the ex is bad news, cause you usually end up feeling bad afterward.  If he still loves you then he will want to try again. If he doesn't, he will keep you around as a friend and keep using you for sex, like he is right now.|`|EDYETUNCaa	It's simple. You can't be friends with him. You need to end all communication with him. I know it hurts and you still care about him, but you're only hurting yourself in this. You're keeping yourself from moving on and finding someone else. I know that after breaking up we miss that attention and their presence, but sometimes we need to do this. If you can't do that yet, don't hang out with him alone. Hang out with friends or in public places till you've weaned yourself off of him. Apparently you all broke up for a reason.

Please for both your sakes get help.|`|AA11010672	Not unless she asks you to join her.|`|QyfF83Yqaa	my advice is to monitor her a little bit, how she feels in the next 2-3 days or so. but be alerted, if something happens. if she attempted in the past for suicide, then you should be careful if you are close to her,and to don't let her injure herself. try to talk to her, try to calm her down, be there for her. maybe she is like this because she hasn't anyone near her to listen, to talk with, to confess more personal things. if you do care about her, be that person. don't tell anyone about this, let it be between you and her for a while.<br>  <br>  if she rejects you and doesn't let you to become her friend and she refuses help, then you should contact other mature persons. <br>  otherwise, anything could happen.<br>  <br>  be careful and good luck ^__^<br>  <br>  <br>  can u answer mine pls? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081024063917AA9JJTt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

zzUgYFy4aa	maybe you should try and be more romantic with him    like all throughout the day ... flirt and give him little notes of love    maybe he just wants more intimacy and less banging
UaHJyTVvaa	As a guy who considers himself to be kinda shy, i think im well suited to answer this question.  I know when i was younger, and was interested in a girl, i would be shy around her and even try to avoid her (i now realize how stupid that is).  A lot of guys are more likely to approach and talk to girls that they are not attracted to at all b/c they feel less intimidated by them, and since they are approaching your "chubby" friend, i would say they might just be using this friend to get you to notice them.  I think there is a good chance this guy is interested in you, but too nervous to ask you to dance.|`|1pGscoqRaa	yes, guys get intimidated. if ur hotter they probably didn't think they had a chance with you. if your friendly and show them you like them they will dance with you.
CljCJrT1aa	According to your testimony, I believe that you are somehow depressed about something. Maybe something bad has happened to you (such as a boyfriend or girlfriend) and you feel like you aren't worth anything. You must realize that you are worth and try to find yourself and raise your self confidence.|`|1hS1pQz5aa	Oh, u poor thing! I feel so bad for you. Well, do you know why you feel this way? Do you feel they are too nice to you? If it makes you feel better, you should do nice things for them...like small things. If that doesn't work...maybe you should see a therapist. But if that makes you feel uncomfortable, then you don't have to. Get a diary. And in this diary, you should pour all your feelings and thoughts. Make lists of all the nice qualities of your friends and what they've done to help you. And, even thought it may be hard at first, list YOUR good qualities and what YOU'VE done to help your friends and/or others.   Plan days just to have fun with your friends. Like going to the movies, or to the mall, or out to lunch, or go-carting.  Just enjoy your life. Good Luck! :D|`|b5xJqC5oaa	Your current situation has really intrigued me.  You claim that you do not deserve your current friends.  I believe that this is absolutely preposterous (no offence).  friends are there to help you in your darkest hour.  A friend will stand by you thick and thin.  That is what friends are for.  Feel happy about you r friend and your life.  Everybody deserves friends.  They don't expect anything for you to do in return.  eat, drink, and be merry, for your frends and your life will merry , too.  ........|...  ........|..........2 points ........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|hVzT1RlEaa	maybe u should go to a few sessions of therapy.  going to therapy doesn't mean ur crazy, a lot of people do it, it just means that u have some things that u need to sort out.  i'd try talking to a therapist if i were u|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	did you do something disloyal? or haven't you been there to help them when they needed you? if not, then maybe you just need a happy pill. maybe you are just depressed. in general. in your case, you focused on your friends. just try to enjoy.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	have you tried doing nice things for them? like you know small stuff? me and my friends are pretty at ease with each other like if one needs something the other one has they wouldn't think twice before lending it to the other one or if someone wanted somethign but had no money the other one would just buy it and let em pay it back whenever. and also theres small stuff we don't even sweat over either|`|4IbT5ZN1aa	Sounds like low self-esteem.  See a counselor.|`|uHpdP52Naa	I bet u have done something to make u feel guilty. I went through tht stage too and im possitive i didnt do anything. You are just stressed! Calm down and continue to be the best friend u can be. They like u or they wouldnt hang around u so just calm down|`|wtjbiRSbaa	Do you feel this way about other things also? or just your friends? if you feel this with other aspects of your life, and you are constantly saddened, maybe you are becoming depressed. i would write down the times and possible reasons when you feel sad, look them over, and possibly talk to someone in the field of psychology, or a doctor.    but good luck, and im sure your a good person.|`|PBBtIrPDaa	You need to speak with your family doctor.  You may be suffering from a form of depression or another psychological illness.  It is not natural to feel that you do not deserve people's love/friendship (unless you're an axe murderer or something).  I would urge you to see your family physician as soon as you can.  You shouldn't go through this by yourself.  Talk to your parents about how you are/have been feeling, or seek spiritual guidance if you're into that sort of thing, but I think your best bet would be to start with your own doctor or someone in the medical field.  Good Luck.

jsS03HSNaa	Oh god, that sucks.  I think you should email her that you don't know what she's been told by your old classmates, but you value her friendship and that you miss talking with her.  And if she doesn't respond or says something stupid, then it's her loss because you seem like a nice guy.      For future reference, if you don't want someone to find out you like them, then don't tell anyone.  It always backfires.|`|M0JfRNipaa	i would definitely just be friend with this girl because you know now that you can't really trust her  gd luck

Personally and probably all girls would love to receive flowers and a poem or card. Now its hard to find pretty flowers at a good price but surprisingly Stop and Shop has a good selection of flowers and are relatively inexpensive. Also  you should make her a card or writ a poem to go along with it. Write it on nice paper or type it because you want her to be able to hold on to it. Hope that helped!|`|UMHEAQaGaa	deffinately a fluffy teddy =P all girls will adore something soft,cuddly and personalised ... also she can hug it when thinking of you! |`|E9TqDn5maa	Well Valentine is abot romance, candy, and a card. You could manage with $10 but you have to be a little creative. There is a gaint lolly pop at wallgreens for a $1 its really cute if you want be a little oringal than chocolates plus its cheap and big. Then you need to buy a card of your choice and write your poem in there. And if you could find flowers less than $5 that would be great. Jones has them sometimes they are actually pretty. So good luck. Happy Valentine's Day.|`|ajK4OLROaa	y don't u make her some thing to go with the poem

There's your answer.  And don't try to start a casual thing with him because you know you want a relationship and he doesn't. You'll only be making things more painful for you.

Ask like what he does on the weekends, or what he is doing after work one day, and if he makes up an excuse or seems busy you then know he is not into you, and does not want to hang out. if this guy likes you, hell be like " nothing, want to chill after work?" then you will know what 2 expect.

3ctchU2faa	I am suspecting that he is still nervous from his inexperience. This happened with my boyfriend as well, not being able to climax during sex when we first started.  While you are in the middle of foreplay, ask him to instruct you on what feels good to him, with touch and so on. Experiment with different positions until he finds one that he really likes, maybe some sexy music, lingerie, etc.   Sex is complex for both people participating, so it takes time and practice to really be able to get into the swing of things. Just take time to find each others pleasure points, and things will eventually get better.    Have fun and good luck!|`|vl8w7AtDaa	its the nerves. the more you guys do it, the more likely he will climax|`|ZfoBpMxBaa	First, let's assume he can climax on his own in private, if not then he needs to seek some medical advice. But he could have deep seated anxiety about sex. You may need to take an inactive roll and let him do what he'd do by himself in front of you. If he can't get the same results with you with him, then it's anxiety, and he may need to see a therapist. If he does, then I hope you were paying attention because it could be a matter of technique and particularly sensitive spots.|`|Y9hBknBuaa	Maybe he's nervous about the diseases you can get. Or he thinks u do it too much.|`|XlqXfVePaa	It will be easier to climax if he relaxes and is more confident. Compliment him and he'll get more confident. Try oral on him before sex, use your hands as well and then try different positions, be creative. You might find one that works better for yourself as well.|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	go to the doctors with him and ask for viagra. the doctors might think young men are messing them around if they ask, but if you're there to complain as an unsatisfied female partner to the doc, he'll believe you.|`|b952dc4daef7cdac170e8b48c85a490daa	Does he masterbate? If he does maybe he can start without you then you jump in at the end a couple times to get him comfortable in front of you.    If he never has, buy him a porno and give him some privacy to understand the feeling before he's with you again.|`|EDYETUNCaa	I bet it's nerves.     With you being his first sexual encounter and him knowing that you'd had sex before, probably compounds his problem. He probably just over thinks it and wants to please you more than anything (almost like he's afraid you're comparing him to your other experience). I'm pretty sure he's just worried about not performing well and in reality his nerves and his insecurities are making him not climax.|`|AA10278534	Could be nerves, but after an hour and a half, I'd say he's got a problem. Ask him to mention it to his doctor. In the meantime, enjoy your endless stiffy.    Viagra is for erectile dysfunction, so if he's getting it up, he doesn't need it. You don't mention age or any physical conditions, but if he's normal otherwise, I'd suggest the doctor.|`|m5QdbPb3aa	Tease him the first thing in the morning.  Tease him until he can't take it anymore.  Rub and touch him in the special places and then tell him to lay on his back and you get on top.  Stay on top and move your pelvis slowly.  Change the rhythms fast and slow.  Also play with the area behind the testicles if he likes it.  Felacio is a great way too.  Different positions will make a man climax faster than others.  I think when a man has is not "working"  thrusting etc., he tends to be more vulerable because he has no control.  When a woman is on top she has all the control and can therefore control the situation.  You can do it take it slow.  Good luck and use some K-Yjelly as well|`|zrFzbDHUaa	I cannot answer this I don't want to be reported, sorry because before that, I had a great answer for you.|`|a4da5109c8bdb18661f94827b55902d5aa	i don't know, can he get himself to climax? if so ask him the way he does it and maybe that will help, try looking on the web to see if their are any sites to help you out on this one, good luck x|`|yUP05L2Iaa	see if watching porn helps|`|HgRYP3cJaa	yes, nerves.  just let him make the advances when he's ready. set the mood and relax.|`|or0rZ3KPaa	Hmm, this may sound offensive or awkward (and im sorry if it does), but has your boyfriend done any drugs?    The reason i ask is because a friend of mine had a similar problem, and it was because her boyfriend used to do drugs that effected his stimulation process. Other than that, i doubt it would be nerves because even nerves cannot stop stimulation.
Sora8bglaa	Well, In my opinion you should dump him, but if you truly think that you two are in love then go for it.  If he does something again then dump him.  It really comes down to whether you wanna trust your friends or not, because if they tell you he did something with his record I would believe them.  If you think that you have done all you can with the relationship but you know he is going to cheat again then dump him, but I don't want you left with the question "What If?"

Is a guy that would do that to you really the best you deserve? I would say certainly not. In taking him back you rewarded him for bad behavior.

AA12108398	Keep talking to him, get closer. Don't wait until he has to leave for college. Ask him out or something!! Maybe you guys can have a summer romance and see where that leads you.

So, he was delighted when she found a gay dance partner.    Dancing is fun and can be arousing, but a dance is not a show of sexual affection. If it was then you wouldn't see the bride slow dancing with her father at weddings... or her grandfather... or her husband's grandfather.    Is she your girlfriend?? Next time you're doing a walk & talk in passing period in between classes, just reach over and hold her hand. If she smiles and gets all happy then you're a couple. If she pulls away, then you're not. If she pulls away and seems mad or shocked then you're a "good friend" and have absolutely no chance now and probably ever.|`|4PKuVsSzaa	NO|`|vHdSGui8aa	no, you are NOT a couple    in response to previous comment:  haha. a couple of silly little kids : )|`|FrSDLRfyaa	what  no|`|oVz0fde6aa	You want me to say yes, so yes|`|bD1KmZACaa	no|`|pGNyeEhRaa	not really.    if you like her just ask her out.  a girl will not approach a guy unless he approaches her get it?|`|F8AzaUKHaa	nah|`|JBvLMBRzaa	It's hard to tell since it was just a slow song .  Did you to have a conversation while dancing ?  Or did you try talking to her after the dance ?  You need to associate with her , and gradually you'll find hints and clues .|`|m56Ty3zmaa	if she isn't givin you signs and things went back to normal after you finished dancing...then I would say that she isn't all that into you..sorry but from what u said it sounds like she isn't interested...I know that when I don't like a guy...I ignore him as much as possible...|`|Y9hBknBuaa	no u aren't a couple just for that. but i think she likes you,but is shy around you.|`|P8WuDX5Iaa	Naw lmaooooo but try getin at her if she dance wiff yuh she prolly wants to poke yur vain;)  Points please:)|`|pgD455v7aa	NO!!!!|`|l6NYIJQXaa	if she smiled sweetly at you, she thinks that, wait a cupple days|`|7D6817LFaa	no! a dance means nothing|`|MhZvYb8Baa	It absolutely does not mean you guys are a couple. At dances, girls just want to have fun. It means you guys danced,and that's that.|`|u3Md6fsbaa	uh... no. that doesn't mean you're a couple, it means you two danced.    You need to talk to her. Ask her. Guessing games will just give you a headache.|`|0sqRwzcfaa	no not at all but if you like this girl you should ask her out on a date|`|ThQ5BIPJaa	no your not a couple|`|d7QiFzOaaa	probably not because it was just a dance but that might be her sign that she wants to go out with you i say ask  her out on a date and see how it goes good luck|`|gT1sWhgpaa	Well a slow dance does not mean that you are a couple it's what happens after that will determine if you are or not. Girls are shy and if you like her you should make theFIRSTt move to ask her out again or to ask her email or phone number so you can Communicate  with her. Girls are not hard to read...if she accepted to dance with you THAT BECAUSE SHE LIKE YOU so wake up and make a move and enjoy!!!|`|7Ca2Iobuaa	no but if u say something then she might think so so id be clear if u dont or do want her to be wit u|`|9wwhKkWeaa	lol no.  if you're attracted to her, tell her.  lmfao.|`|5o2CbJB7aa	Well, I'm sorry to inform you...

QH6fhKTBaa	shes prob just shy about the situation  i was just wondering if you know what any of her friends think about you coz if they dnt lyk you that cod be why she hasnt decided yet  but if she asked you back i think tat meant she didnt see the question coming and didnt think you lykd her  but you should defiently give her some time, but just dont wait too long still flirt and all to ensure her tat you still lyk her.  gud luck :)|`|m6xvhlJqaa	Thats and idk...it takes gurls a while to figure out things...|`|hVY2AWEbaa	Is just a better way of saying NO and completely shut u down|`|GiRm0r4saa	She means that she isn't into you......|`|y3tPrTtBaa	a sensitive one if you don't want to hurt someones feelings!|`|o1irBbeNaa	yeaaah, my friends say that when they dont know how to turn a guy down without hurting his feelings. try becoming better friends first.|`|xfj1B7YSaa	give her some time. she probably didnt see it coming since the two of you have been friends. so the though about you guys becoming more than friends is foreign to her.    to be honest, the odds of her liking you back is fairly small. but i like how you told her and that makes u a man. if she doesnt realize that, then shes not worth your time and shes an idiot.    so just hang in there. ok? girls can be unpredictable|`|Qo6x1ju1aa	She needs more thought about it... she will get back to u soon no doubt.|`|FrSDLRfyaa	an answer that means she wants to stay friends|`|9wwhKkWeaa	She's confused whether it's just friendship or she's attracted to you.  Or even in the middle. Just wait awhile and hopefully you both will talk about it.|`|9HaNKSRHaa	Well...grow her respect and luv...make her laugh...giggle...flirt...repeat.|`|IGpCFPWsaa	she doesnt like  you she just doesnt know  how to tell you without  hurting your feelings.|`|PKwEKfG7aa	sometimes you just don't know whether you like someone or not. maybe she just needs a little more time with you and her just being friends before taking it further.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Take it slow & don't push it.|`|lFg1EJeGaa	She doesn't know if she thinks of you in that way yet.

2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Honey my husband did this to in our first year of marriage. I think the first year is very tough. Going from single to a married man takes a toll on them I think. My hubby would always go out with the guys too. On his birthday he wanted to go out with them and I was literally a tag along. I ended up leaving and he let me walk downtown to my car alone. Drive home alone and he never came home that night. He ended up staying the night with his cousin a lot. It was almost where I thought we were heading for divorce. Now 4years later its better but we still fight. Those issues you had while dating will still be issues in your marriage. I know its tough. You want to be his number one and you take the back seat to the boys. I feel for you because Ive been there. No he isnt gay! Why on earth would someone say that. Men have a hard time committing. You should be first and he is obviously putting you last. Something is wrong just give it time. Maybe he is in some kind of depression. Maybe he is being a baby because his single buddies are making fun of him for having a ball and chain. Guys are clueless especially single guys. I would try to get couple friends and get him away from those losers. For some reason guys like to be around their buddies more than their sweetie. This will change as your husband sounds a lot like mine. Give it time and just try to do things for you. Work out go out with your friends if you have any. Maybe go to the movies with your mom or something and dont tell him where you are. Play hard to get! You have to in marriage too! He will see how it feels.|`|e5ec786ff8b2ba4d23a8bc87faee6379aa	I have the same problem. Mine wont comut with me either. He told me once that theres not reason to get mad a me cuz it won't do any good. so he just goes about his business. I have found that men will ask us to marry them to shut us up and they think that will make us happy our hole life. Personally, i got that this happens quite a bit and your just now married, guess what you shouldn't have married him.  Theres no comut between you before marriage theres no comut after marriage. You shouldn't have married him hun. Your this unhappy and you though marriage would have made you happy. I am sorry but we are all wrong thinking that. I only got married for the kids now i'm stuck in hell till they are grown cuz i am not putting them threw that. But you never know i may leave if it keeps up.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	You are with a drug addict.    Clean up your addiction to a loser and life will be better for you.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	its not you honey you are with an emotional abuser get away while you can he is all ready eroding your self esteem with his actions towards you.|`|iS1sHYbtaa	um, im sorry, but he has all the signs of being homosexual. you notice that he runs to his buddies and stays gone a long time. he wont tell you whats wrong, but its nothing you've done, he's just dealing with the guilt and maybe denial of being gay. of course he would not wont to share this with you. he feels that he's failed and he doesnt want to hurt you. i may be wrong, but just think about it. im sorry if ive offended you. good luck|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Drag him to counseling.    Or    Tell him if he doesn't start talking to you, you're going to leave.  But you need to really mean it and be prepared to leave.|`|lfQHjp5baa	I'm curious on a few things.  Are his buddies single, and how old are they.  Do you think he was pressure into marriage?  Do they do a lot of drinking?   Also, and not to put things in your head hon, but do his friend have other gals over when he is there.      You may need to put your foot down and give him an ultimatum.  Either go to counseling on how he treats you, his communication skills, unwillingness at spending time with you, abandonment, lack of intimacy, and rudeness to name a few.  The pattern is already totally unacceptable in my book, especially at such an early stage.  If you don't put a stop to it now, it will only get worse.  You don't invest your time and emotions in a relationship that you can clearly see so early on that there may be little or no return on your or investment or effort..  Once you get a family started, it will only get worse and more complicated.  He needs to either choose you or his friends. Not to completely loose his friends, but to choose you OVER them...
5d92d4d47a0206e6c5d7d342e7d48e8eaa	There is a lot of pressure put on young people like you, so that you will feel that you NEED to be in a relationship. And you really don't. Not until your ready to handle it. Flirting may not get you a guy, but it may make other guys think you are a skank and you don't want that. Just try to be friends with a few guys and see what happens.
YeLy2dK4aa	Love is a game that deals with feelings, trusting, emotional feelings of the one you realy love. You don't need to decieved yourself. You like him physically, but you lack emotional feelings on him. And the truth about it is that, you are not mean to be. Stop decieving yourself and look for your right guy. Simple.|`|fgOslhjhaa	let him go- it will hurt for a while.    and then you need to move on, to show your self not to go back to him because you will find some one you like more and so will he. just leave each other alone.|`|Gl4036CWaa	If you have any ounce of love for him you will just leave him alone...you cant make yourself love him...do him a favor and let him be even if he suffers it will only be temporary.|`|63da036794c7cec90e03dd3341fd0a04aa	You need to let him go and let him find someone that can love him the way he deserves to be loved!|`|zhZWm0gNaa	Sorry to say but he deserve someone better than you and from what you have said about him, he is a gem that is rare and some woman someday would be lucky to have him    Spear him the misery and pain. He will move on without you and he will find someone else who will make him happy.    You don't love him so please do not torment him by going back to him. He deserve better and will find someone else eventually.    What you have done is the best for both of you and you have done well to walk away from a relationship that would only deteriorates into bitterness for you and him.|`|sr7jX2wYaa	He  need to  let  him go  & have  a chance  to get over you. Part of  the problem is  you wanted  him to stand up for himself, when you went on your  verbal attacks,instead  he cowed down to you, & this  can be even more infuriating. It shows  caring, but you also  see it as a weakness in his manliness. I know ..  I had someone just like that. You will always  care  about the guy & for as  long as you live  he will always care  about you too. But  you need to let him be & find  a guy  who cares about  you, & loves  you but  will stand up for  himself, & give you a little arguing  back. You need someone  willing  to say he disagrees with you when  does. Not a yes mam, man. & he needs a girl that  is just as  submissive  as he is, who  won't  find  fault  with  him constantly, but  is accepting of  who he is. I think  it  will take a little  time  to get over  each  other, but  it is for the best & the sooner you start the better.*|`|mz7xWOYfaa	Definately move on. You dont like him.|`|Qkjt2GVEaa	if he's as much of a poon as it sounds like you did him a favor -    no self-respecting dude should let a woman treat him in a manner less than he deserves -    do not ever talk to him again and quit acting sappy -    if you really felt bad you wouldn't have done that stuff in the first place -|`|LjCaTM0Naa	Get rid of him and get the one that is smashing your head by the walls, drink and forgets..make children with him so you can grow them up alone , live on social security and think back of this guy. Too late..
8HR1rc0Haa	during this stage in your life you're going through a lot. your hormones are crazy and what you're feeling is confusing. but what you have explained is beautiful. the love that you have explained is quite wonderfull and most people can only DREAM about a love that you are willing to give. that girl just needs some space, you're just throwing too much love at her tooo quickly. she needs time for friends and sports. take a break and if she does not come back realize this: she has lost the most precious thing in her life and she will regret it one day (mark my words) one day she will look back and after she's dated idiots, she'll realize you were the one person who treated her with any caring. let her realize this, if you keep pushing her to come back, or cry, it's going to push her farther away. leave her alone and let her use her own brain for once.     don't cry. love hurts sometimes, but it doesn't have to when you find the right person. find someone who will love you as much as you love them. then it will be beautifull. i know right now you can't dream of anyone else because it's her, it always will be, and you want her soo badly. but you need to calm down and realize (i was once much like you and 15) that time will heal, it may take you 5 years before you are over her or 4 months...who knows!     someone who kisses another person while with some one or even on a break...i think that's just wrong, she technically cheated on you, but she didn't have sex with him and she told you to either a) hurt you or b) she felt really bad about it and wanted to be honest.     forgive her and when she comes back...if she does....you think long and hard, longg and haarddd ...is it what you want? is she truly making you happy?    good luck!|`|Bb0i9RcEaa	Aww, you are so sweet [:  I could tell you really love this girl, so you have to anything and everything in your power to get her back. Call her and tell her how you feel. Tell her everything you just wrote above ^^^^^^^.  Tell her , you are ready for the "break" to be over. SHOW her how you feel. Go to her with a dozen roses and tell her the only person you ever want to be with is her. Don't lose out on this, trust me. I lost my first love. and I regret it everyday.|`|UAHrQOfTaa	start off by being a christian.   God will take care of the rest.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	I am afraid it is over, completely, and she at this point is just making a fool of you.    Sorry.|`|30c385736ad80896e7fc5424882309aaaa	=(   sad...im in my first relationship too, same goes for my boyfriend. Were both a team and work through things together. I hope it wont end. I worry i'll get bored and want more in the end, cuz i havent had other experiences before him. Vice Versa.   But from what it looks like ur girl did end up wanting more and i think its best for you to move on as well. She's young and so are you, there will be many more out there, keep you chin up.    (me and my bf are in our early 20s) *i waited for what i wanted*|`|BnhFwrhCaa	Hey, Dont be all bummed. I'm sorry to hear about that but listen, you are only 15 years old. I remember when i was 15 I was sooo much in love with this guy. He was my first love and the world to me. I had to move thousands of miles away and we were kinda having a long distance relationship. well, that didnt last long. He was falling for another girl so he broke up with me. I thought the world was crashing down on me.   Now Im older I know better than that.  If this girl really cares about you she wouldnt treat you that way. I know its hard to break up with someone that you've been with for so long. But she really is not the world to you. You have your whole life ahead of you and someday you will find someone a thousand times better than this girl.  I would say to hell with her before it's too late. The longer you stay with her the harder it gets. I dated this guy in high school, we were together for 3 years. It was so hard to break up with him. The reason why I did was because he treated me so bad (and he stalked me!).    Dude, Im telling you, this girl is not your world. Dont cry over her, its not worth it. This isnt true love. True love is when you love someone for their flaws. She apparently does not love your flaws. Go and find someone who will treat you better.|`|LxYybxVxaa	maybe you two do need a break. I'm a girl and I know that you can never be sure that your bf/gf is really the one unless you date around. Otherwise, you may always wonder. Try not to be so intuitive about everything that's going on. If she really is the one, things will fall into place. Tell her how you feel. She may realize that you aren't being controlling... just a little bit paranoid. Good luck!|`|ekEnHMncaa	i'm so sorry. those kinds of situatuions can be hard and tough to get through. but u gotta stay strong and sit her down for a personal one on one talk. tell her that u love her, that'd u do anything for her, and why u always want to know where she's at. if u two are only15 keep in mind that a 15 year old girl s not always so stable herself. she probably just wants to date other people. u have to understand that even though u may THINK your in love u may not really be. think of how she's treated u and how you've treated her. do u really derserve one another? are u really herperfect match? what about her to u?  hope i helped!!!!
KJIuVV8jaa	Don't wait because it seems unfair to you. It's seems a little unrealistic for a relationship to be like that but your not really in a relationship. If you do want to wait for him in a way don't get attached to anyone but still play the field. But keep trying to contact him.
AA10494666	It depends.  If your family is strict, and you are just getting to know him, spend some time sitting and talking with him.<br>  <br>  If he wants to do anything that makes you uncomfortable (tends to happen), don't fall for it.  You can stand your ground, but also get closer by talking and hanging out.  Only go further (kissing) if you are really comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  Be careful he doesn't move too fast - guys have insane hormones that make them say and do things best for THEM sometimes.  Just keep checking in with yourself, and make sure you are comfortable at each step.  In this, you can't go wrong.|`|AA11963700	This is a gloden chance to spend quality time with him just check if he feels the same for you and if yes just flow in the boat of emotions and enjoy the night.|`|142kB4M4aa	when the fireworks start <br>  you kiss him<br>  <br>  trust me  something good will happen<br>  lol<br>  but anyway<br>  if he's really shy he just might faint|`|uiq4FQIiaa	avoid your parents.<br>  <br>  i am like 17 and i cant get my head straight if my parents are there. it makes me feel guilty for no reason|`|iuWSO72Kaa	aww omgee perfect idea you can probably just hang around with him watch the fireworks and talk to each other a little than like maybe under the fireworks you could tell him "i love you" and give him a kiss on the cheek like not lips UNLESS he like goes in for the kiss on the lips. but don't do it in front of your families!!!<br>  aw good luck <33333|`|7tvGGTeTaa	I think you should go. Relax and have a good time. What will be will be. I think most guys are more shy then girls. So maybe hold his hand. A little jester to boost your confidence and his.

8JGlNpAeaa	A LOT.<br>  <br>  True love is patient, forgives and is willing to be there for you when you need someone. If someone truly loves you, he'll/she'll pull through for you when you need it, and talk to you about virtually anything, from the small details of everyday life to your problems. <br>  <br>  Lust is merely a physical attraction. While true love loves a person in his/her entirety, Lust only looks at whats on the outside, and flees when trouble arises. <br>  <br>  Sometimes its easy to confuse the two, but stay clear minded and do not confuse the two.<br>  <br>  AND LASTLY:<br>  True love is willing to wait.<br>  Lust isn't.|`|qjsk9Oxlaa	lust is important part of falling in love...lust brings two pple together,its part of the process, the next stage...<br>  <br>  its not about difference more about how much your relationship has progressed...you need lust to maintain the relationship|`|cfc07a5d8ffaa8deb195655fec4ab0fdaa	Lust focuses on gratification of yourself, while love focuses on giving of yourself to another person.|`|RsJHmJKYaa	In Like ...beats it all!!|`|AA11963700	True love is trust,if you both trust each other you feel confidence on each other secure,happy and comfortable.Lust is  desire to have sexual pleasure from your partner for which you can even flirt,bluff and make stories.|`|JnjtseN4aa	lust is more of a sexual desire to be with a person.<br>  a lot of times there is a lot of lust at the begining of a relationship and it is mistaken for love..<br>  <br>  but when you're in love you will know.. it will be different.<br>  loving someone is stronger|`|BqrLJnECaa	lust makes you get all tingly and excited in your pants. <br>  <br>  true love is something that is inexplainable. Its truly an experience that only your heart can tell you what it feels like. You know when you are in love.|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	Lust is instant gratification and love is long term.
RqVUkfgoaa	you need to contact the local women's shelter and get out while you can...things will only get worse and honestly do you want your children growing up thinking that this is how a relationship should be? think about your son and your unborn child you need to get them into a safe environment...i know it's hard to do(i've been in that place myself) but once you make the step and get help from people that care it will make it easier...alot of courts have victim advocates and the local police/sheriff can help you get in contact with the right people...good luck|`|H41u0B8Jaa	You think he "still loves you very much"???  He has a very strange way of showing it.  If you stick around he will end up beating you to death.  For the sake of both you and your son when he is at work leave and either go to relatives or a shelter.  I would also get a restraining order against him as well.    You shouldn't stay with a man who has made you scared for your life...that is not love.|`|AA11785285	Off to a truly bad start... married two years, and plopping out a second child.  Not good for a loving relationship to solidify---you two barely know each other....truly.  <br>  <br>  You gave your marriage no time to develop....Kids are not bonding, sweets, they are divisive, even between loving couples fully prepared to step to the plate and endure the jolt every relationship takes with the arrival of kids.  <br>  <br>  What WAS the rush to have a bunch of bayyyyybeeeeeees????  As long as I have been in this business, I will just never understand this.... BC pills are 99% effective.... damn good.<br>  <br>  Advise:<br>  <br>  Get some counseling... you children deserve it... and hon, life as a single mom of two is goddamn lonely.  No guy will date you except for a booty call---men simply don't wish to raise children of other men.... ain't natural.... get counseling, get back in school, get a job.... then with an education you are in a more secure position to  leave if you so opt. No $$$, no education=poverty.<br>  <br>  Here's the list from my mom.  Get some counseling before you end it<br>  <br>  1.  The most important decision you will ever make is who you marry.  Choose with your head as well as your heart.<br>  2.  Have no children until your bond is strong, and have no more than you yourself can support.  You may just have to<br>  3.  At any and all costs finish your education to qualify for those high paying jobs.  It is likely that you will work sometime during your marriage, probably for decades…. Get paid for it. And remember, your kids and your education are forever…. Husbands, lovers and promises are not!!<br>  4.  Have a stash of cash no one knows about even if you are sure you will never need it.  You absolutely will, and the more the better.|`|31a40b58cede026838639b7e16841669aa	If you're able to say & put in writing that you've been scared for your life several times..why are you willing to put your child (almost children) in that kind of danger? Take your son & go to a family member's house or close close friend & explain the situation. Get a lawyer & divorce the bastard. You don't have to use his money. Ask your family for help. & you can take him to court - you won't lose your son..they don't give custody to abusive people.|`|a8d84474cd0c157fccb3be985125bdf3aa	Do you have a family member nearby that can come get you while he's at work? You need to get out of there - not just for you but for your kids. When he finally understands what he is doing is terrible, hopefully you both can go to counseling and work it out.|`|0HfhltzZaa	You need to leave now before the situation escalates to something that leaves your loved ones devastated. You should go. Think about it, do you really want your son to emulate this person and grow up to be like him. Sorry, but your husband sounds horrible. Your son is taking in everything that is being said and done in your household. I know this sounds harsh but it's the truth. You need to think of your son and unborn baby and give them a chance to be in a household that isn't abusive. Leave! Go to a women's shelter. You can call your local sheriff's department or police department and they will help you go into the right direction.|`|aZV7MJoQaa	This sounds like my life, I just left my husband a week ago while he was at work because he was like this to me. We have a six month old daughter.You do have options! Get a job and save money, or call around for shelters. If he loved you hun he would care about your feelings!!  You can take care of your son just fine, apply for housing and welfare for a little while, it sucks but it helps you get back on your feet. Take your independence and run with it, he knows you can, that is why he tells you that you cant!|`|J93NVj5Waa	you need to get out of this situation for your sake as well as the children's. and I'm sorry to say this, but a person that loves someone very much does not make them fear for their life. he doesn't love you he just wants to control you. this is something I've wondered about people that say a person verbally and physically abuses me but I love them. what is it exactly about him you feel is loving? there is somewhere you can go even temporarily to escape this situation even without money.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Try going to a friend′s or your parents′home. Take your son with you and stay a couple of days in a safe place for a while. He can′t do anything to you for doing that! Then try to deal the situation from wherever you′re staying but not alone with him! Always with someone else there so he can′t have the chance to hurt you, but you need to get out now.|`|AA11963700	Well if this has become his habbit then this is not good for you and your children,you have to talk to him.You say that you also love each other and I think you knw this man ver well just handel him tactfully,talk and I belive that love can bring lot of changes in a person.I know my suggestion is tough but effective for you your hubby and children.|`|kF5qDuLuaa	Find a shelter or go to friends or family.  Do whatever you have to do to get out of the situation.  If you fear for your life it's not fair for you to stay there with the kids.  Take your son and go now.|`|CMo0Fh1Zaa	go to a shelter.  get away from this jerk and then have NO contact with him.|`|RrYXCACEaa	My sister went through the exact same thing. She was also a stay at home mom. Do you have a relative near by who will listen and help? If so, run! And if not, still, run. Since you are married, ? of all your martial assets belong to you even if you do not have a job. (same in every state.) take what you can withdraw and get out of there. Tell the police what he has been doing and they can help you get a lawyer who will make him pay child support. You will have to get a job to support your self, but if you are really serous about what he is doing and you fear for your life and kids lives, this will not bother you much.|`|bBxl1XDraa	I have been in an abusive relationship myself before in the past, I totally understand you and I use to ask myself the same question I don't know why I stayed. there are a number of reasons, you love him even though everything that you have to put up with because I am sure he was not this way in the Beginning and you are thinking to yourself that he is going to change and it will get better and then you look at your situation and how you want to leave but you do not know how to leave and you do not want to go to a shelter with your children. If you have a good family bond with your relatives see if you can live with them for a short period of time until you get on your feet.  You have to start thinking about your children at this point.  You will probably have to leave when he goes to work if he is refusing to let you take your son.  You are going to have to find someone really close that you can trust and confide in to help you out of this situation.|`|ku7KYOX8aa	Firstly if you want to save the marriage then go for counseling, it might help!! If you don't feel the same way for him anymore leave.. go to your familys house and quickly start getting custody of your son!! call the police and let them know what hes doing to you... get a restraining order and just stay with loved ones till you can get back on your feet!!|`|0MeeCqgOaa	You wanted zhe bad guy now you have all the drama you want. You can come look for sympathy all you want but I bet you will do exactly nada because what you have is what you want.<br>  If you wuldnt have wanted all that drama you would have married the guy who was "too nice".|`|D0MxsSjpaa	He abuses you?<br>  and your pregnant and you have a son.<br>  I think you should warn him that the next time you guys ever go through this your out. Hunny that's really bad because your pregnant and what is a baby without a great mother and father?<br>  But as you meantioned your living a " nightmare"<br>  Try one more week with him and be as nice as possibly and maybe talk this over with him and see what this comes out of. If he however gives you the " nightmare, abuse"<br>  again I suggest you pack your bags and go, this can lead to something really violent I don't want you to get hurt.<br>  If you need anything I am here for you<br>  Good Luck Hunny!<br>  <3 xoxoxo|`|ZBjRcwqQaa	Once you are really sick and tired you wouldn't have second thoughts, you'll just leave. If you want to see both of your children grow up then you need to either get help with him (that's if he acknowledge the both of you need help) or you Need to just make a plan to leave. I'm sure you have family out there to help you out until you can get back on your feet, Find out if there's a women's shelter for women with children. TAKE your child with you if he beat on you, what makes you think he wont take it out on your kids if you leave them there? Think of your safely and your children.
cZOIkDXCaa	why do you care about this girl? you have never spoken to her obviously and you're jumpin to the conclusion that she wants to BE with you? why don't you establish a friendship with her first and then take it from there..who knows, maybe she is your type..or maybe she acts her age and is super immature.|`|7BFaYGaXaa	We all have to say no to a girl some day<br>  It's a hard thing to do, especially when it actually happens, when you get really nervous or sad.<br>  <br>  She obviously likes you. That's a given.<br>  So just tell her you need to talk to her, and tell her, as a friend, how you feel. Tell her everything.<br>  Obviously, try to do it nicely. Make sure she knows you want to be friends with her after that. Hey! You never know, you might actually start liking her back.<br>  <br>  Hope this works|`|KsRJwI4caa	You could tell her your flattered, and you would enjoy being her friend. Very used line, but you can't "like" someone unless you get to know them, and she is way too young, and it will become illegal very soon for you!  Once you turn 18, you dont want any young girls!!!
7BFaYGaXaa	It's simple.<br>  We all feel like that sometimes when we do something wrong to someone, and then he/she turns out to be nice or way better than we expected, such like your examples, or when i yelled at my little 8-year-old sister for ruining my tennis racket, and then later on she tells me all sweetly that she'll get all her "pennies" and buy me a new one.<br>  Don't worry about it, just tell him that (he'll love it), and just be careful of what you do next time! ;)|`|26F6C7jyaa	maybe thats becuse there are soo many guys out here that aren't that "he can't be true" guy and so when you find that one you just don't feel right|`|w3wu6JS7aa	its due to lack of self confidence.... you dont believe you are as good as he is, but you probably are dont worry!|`|pHqxR6J1aa	u need self confidence if he loves you than you must deserve him|`|UiW6LSpFaa	because your in love with him. Once i had a boyfriend and i felt that same way but i finally just figured out that i really liked him. Its normal to feel that way so don't be worried i hope i helped. And just except him and be thankful you have him in your life. He sounds like he is really sweet and cares for you more than anything.|`|ZpnpCbqhaa	hun you deffinatly deserve him!!<br>  it's just you think you don't deserve him becuase hes just right for yoou and your going to feel that it's just showing you hes the best you could ever ask for i know what you meen when you say this.<br>  you deffinatly deserve him!<br>  <br>       Taylor<3<br>  <br>  <br>            YOU DERSERVE HIM!!<br>                       hehe<br>  and don't forget it!|`|SwzwK9hdaa	You feel this way because you are a typical girl...that's not good.   We don't want the good guy, we prefer those who will act crazy because for some reason it's a rush....bullshit..stop being stupid and realize that you have something good.  If you can't handle the blessing, I'm sure another girl will enjoy it....OKAY!|`|XhP3MGgYaa	i think your tougher than him and he's just soft and sweet. and im sure you don't like that cuz you don't want him to sit there and take sh** from you. you want him to be a man. but it's okay if he's sweet and kind. that's a good thing. :]|`|l9JkpBMWaa	You probably dont feel that you are as confident that he will like you as much as you like him you may view yourself to be less than him but you shouldnt because in a relationship everyone should be equal.<br>  <br>  help me out <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnHUxk0FOxxG9.UY7uSVMlTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080708165421AAZAbjD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0aP93NmVaa	well its because...your spoiled by him.. and your just not used to it. but just stay with him|`|WRfIBzMfaa	Maybe you feel guilty because he seems to love you more than you love him.  Cut out the drama and stop testing him all the time.  Take it easy and see if you can foster a stronger relationship.|`|UTME7Ip1aa	You just gotta accept it. For about the first 6 or 7 months of my current relationship I felt that way too and was scared that he'd break up with me if I did anything stupid. But when I got more comfortable with him I realized that he does actually love me. It just takes time and a bit of a self confidence boost. It's not an uncommon feeling.

69f4a5ba6dd00d43e18c49f4b14d4a28aa	Hey sweetheart, you sound like a nice girl. I'm very sorry that you are hurting, I know exactly how you feel, and you know how it kills us. To be honest keeping hope alive that he will come back is only going to limit you, and keep you from finding someone good. I'm not saying he wasn't good, I'm just saying that if he truly loved you, he would always make time for you, because that is what us real guys do. Just take some time for yourself to heal. Whatever you do don't rush into a new relationship. There is nothing silly about being optimistic, it's human nature. Just know that there is nothing wrong with you, and it's not your fault. You will find happiness, it just won't happen when you want it. Keep your head up. Don't let life beat you, you beat life. Take care.|`|UVciAbXxaa	the way i see it if its meant to be then he come back to you.. good luck 
rSG2B4LPaa	<br>  Check out this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myregistry.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myregistry.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can register at one site for all different types of things!!! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!! |`|AA11380378	This is ridiculous. You cannot be serious! <br>  <br>  You cannot expect for people to buy you underwear and slips, and worse still, to browse your selection of raunchy undergarments. Modesty and discretion is in order. It's perfectly fine to have a lingerie shower, but a registry is meant for other purposes and not meant for your crotchless panties <br>  <br>  Lady, you earn the Tacky and Unnappropriate Award of the day|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	OK, check with Amazon.com.  They sell just about everything online, and you can start a "wish list" that can be e-mailed to all your shower invitees.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your upcoming wedding!|`|L2jPYlbdaa	That would be ridiculously tacky to register for lingerie.<br>  Don't do it.<br>  <br>  Register for things for your home: pots, pans, dishes, glasses, towels, sheets, blankets, curtains, picture frames, lamps, decorative items, etc.|`|rZXQvA75aa	Fredericks of hollywood has a wish list and registry section|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	I would put make a registry. Just have a Lingerie Themed Bridal Shower.  |`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	Victoria's Secret|`|84d2ee0139a6557092dfc2736e3eadb8aa	Register at Macys. They have everything from make-up and perfume to lingerie. Or really, any department store will have it all. Department stores usually have things in all price ranges as well, so that will make it easier for your guests. You can register for some high-end lingerie, and then some less expensive beauty items or something.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A lot of people are saying that it's  tacky to register for lingerie and stuff. But honestly, if I were invited to a shower and it was a lingerie theme, I would be WAY more comfortable just going and buying something that the bride wants rather than guessing. It's such a personal thing, you know?<br>  <br>  In all honesty, the bridal shower is kind of a tacky thing in and of itself. Everyone knows it's to get gifts, and it's culturally accepted. I really don't have a problem with brides registering for fun things JUST for the shower only, if the shower has such a theme. Like I said, I would rather get them something they want rather than a random thong or loofa they don't want. I've heard of all different themes like make-up and beauty items to lingerie to simply household stuff.|`|qWfqztELaa	I agree with some of the responses - It's very tacky to register for lingerie...a wedding registry is for household necessities, like pots and pans, china, towels, etc., and not for something you will wear for your husband on your honeymoon. How would your family members react when they see the racy little number you requested on your list? Instead, I would save the lingerie for your shower(I personally wouldn't if you're having your grandma and other elderly guests at the shower) and/or your bachelorette party. When you or your MOH send out invitations for those events, add a little note like "please bring something naughty/nice for the bride to wear on her honeymoon."|`|0poGXRqTaa	The Bridal Shower IS for gifts, that's traditional.  What some people don't know is that you do not have to get a bridal shower gift AND a wedding gift.  The bridal shower gift IS the wedding gift.  And it is horribly tacky to register for lingerie!  Try registering for housewares. You will be glad you did.<br>  <br>  I have been to lingerie-themed bachelorette parties before. That's something entirely different.|`|a74343e7ca8aa5c50c845ba22afe0528aa	Do not register for lingerie. <br>  <br>  Register for things you need to set up your home - that what registries are for.|`|FcptPiYraa	<a href="http://yourinfo.daymy.com" rel="nofollow">http://yourinfo.daymy.com</a><br>  you can get much information in this website,If you will check anyone link in website<br>  |`|8aa1b215c8d6eee277d8176d813caf1caa	Try Macys...
gftV8s84aa	Of course not! My husband is shorter than I am, only by an inch or 2, and it's not an issue what-so-ever. If he treats you good, and if your fine with it, then that's all that matters! Look at all the celebrities out there who have shorter men, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon, Verne Troyer and Genevieve Gallen...and there's a ton more! Enjoy him for who he is, and what he has to offer, not how tall he is. Best Wishes!!<br>  |`|fcTRSKucaa	The question is do you like him?<br>  <br>  I'm a tall chick myself and I've dated guys who were shorter than me, you might get a snide remark here and there but trust me, he's not gonna get any crap for dating a tall chick. I think if you like someone height doesn't matter.|`|16c2CbFraa	I dont think its a problem. If you two get on great and have a good relationship then why should it be? If YOU are attracted to him then thats all that matters. I am quite a tall girl too and I know some guys who are shorter than me who are HOT and nice guys! and I wouldnt care what height they were :) Doesn't matter what anyone else thinks my dear :)|`|F2u2r8z4aa	It's relative. Your happiness with him should be all that matters. Just be sure to bring along a phone book in case he needs it and you'll both make out fine.|`|RlDOYFcoaa	of course its not a problem ! :O yu like him and thats, thats ! yu dun have to care wut other thinks ;} and beside i've seen couples like that and i think its cutee ! x3 |`|FYWGxjneaa	Why would that matter? Couples come in all shapes and sizes.|`|ZEOeuRMPaa	just walk on ur knees...........lol joke<br>  no it doesnt im really tall and i went out witha person who was half size of me <br>  but then we broke up coz i threw an apple at him haha|`|8aa1b215c8d6eee277d8176d813caf1caa	No, don't worry about his height...|`|KXKfkg3oaa	No it's not a problem it's just the way you are.|`|wqq8ROFXaa	Absolutely not!  If you like him it doesn't matter.  I think you should go for it!  |`|POHWTDPRaa	It's only a problem if you think it is But he's just a crush, so how could it be?|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is only a problem if you see it as a problem.  For some reason I always like the shorter guys.  The tall ones always seem so awkward to cuddle up to (who wants to look at their belly button).|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Height is not a problem being short. <br>  <br>  It is another body part.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	It's how you feel and not what anybody else thinks, your the one that counts. Remember that.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	honey, if you are fine it, then it's fine!!! =)|`|JCGckRu6aa	If you like him, what does it matter?|`|Y072RbS0aa	How much taller is he? You could always wear flat shoes, but trust me if you love wearing heels, eventually you will start to think about how it will be a little funny when you wear heels and you are next to him, especially if you plan on dancing....<br>  <br>  Overall height is not important. I went out with a guy shorter than me, he was a really great guy, but it ended for good reasons. But I never wore heels with him. I think if you are really okay with his height, don't worry about what other people will think... |`|ec0c9e8415736306f06b43a3b3c74134aa	I don't think it should matter. If you are mature enough to accept the fact that people may stare or say things to both of you. If you give it shot you may be pleasantly surprised. |`|z6DCHxtAaa	I was 5'8 and dated a girl that was 6' in flats, and usually liked to wear heels.

Give her more frequent comments on facebook. However, don't rush, be patient. Find out what she likes but don't be too straightforward. Most importantly, make sure she's single! You don't want to be caught in a love triangle. Then when you feel it's right, ask her out in a group first before going out with only the both of you. Good luck!|`|AG6Kk7ACaa	DO NOT ASK HER OUT!<br>  Im telling you this because she WILL think that of  you as a freak!<br>  Trust me on my Tagged dudes ask me out and it is such a turn off.<br>  <br>  What I would do is this, get your girl friend to mabye get you to more closer but in a slow way.|`|svEGFCdkaa	u noe her from facebook ~ but do u noe her in rl ? are u really like her or ? if yes u should ask her out to saying abt it .. dun b shy ~ |`|xqu5CoYraa	face to face communication is the best|`|9f422c20efa5721ed445fd2f52512cf3aa	talk to her over MSN messenger or sth.. when you've reached the comfortable level ask her out<br>  <br>  for the first date, go for lunch... like 2hrs? <br>  <br>  so she won't feel you being pushy, and lunch it's good for in case it feels strange or better still if lunch was great she will be wanting to go out with u more often.|`|V5Q3FBHBaa	Keep talking to her. Go slowly. You don't want to freak her out. <br>  <br>  Give a few hints about the possibility of hanging out sometime, see how she responds.

6dafd7e57b2f74ca1edb18c99e806a3faa	It means he isn't interested in a serious relationship.  He likes to "hang out" with other girls.  Probably what you call "dating" he calls "hanging out."  What you call "dating" he considers a steady relationship.|`|od6TK7E8aa	it means what it is, he values the time he spends with you, and doesn't want anymore out of it<br>  <br>  guys aren't as complicated as girls think we are|`|YotV0pOCaa	I think he wants to be up front and let you know he, for whatever reason, does not want to be deeply involved, but likes you and has fun with you. He may have religious views that he has not explained. Why don't you ask him for an explanation and stop wondering?

If you don't like the answer, move on.|`|ojIjF06Oaa	your not wrong for feeling the way you do..as you can see its right in your face he still probably wants her..and also its only been 2 months..it will still take time to get over it if he is willing to...try asking him about them.and tell him to remove them shits..shes old news..he need to get over it. and its disrespectful for having them up there |`|a4aed7acbb173a3c044a002dcf84152baa	If they are old pictures, he might have just forgotten about them.<br>  <br>  Or he doesnt think anything of it.<br>  <br>  I guess it is a tad inappropriate......ya you could probly mention something...but dont sound upset about it|`|zcZGRPc2aa	seeing as you've only been with him 2 months, have you considered that maybe he still has memories of her and doesnt want to give those memories up yet? give him time.|`|7h1tFvgDaa	Hes still ******* her, because she probably sucks a better dick than you.|`|liJhjOn7aa	Talk to him, ask him if he can remove them that they make you uncomfortable.|`|07dbecd577f9ea4a7031637996b39fbcaa	Why dont you ask him??<br>  <br>  It wouldnt hurt to just ask if it bother you that much...|`|9qSD385Paa	Obviously there is part of you that is bothered by the fact that he has pictures of the two them together whether or not it is posted on facebook or just on his computer for his own personal means.<br>  <br>  With most guys it boils down to laziness.  I don't think that he keeps them around to make it look like he is still with her or so he can look at the two of them, honestly i think he is just too lazy to either take them down or to untag himself.<br>  <br>  You have to also learn to not be so sensative and threatened.  People have ex's. Just b/c he is with you now doesn't mean that he is obligated to delete anything that reminds him of her b/c you are feeling a little threatened. There are memories whether he keeps the pictures or not. And i don't want to raise suspision in your mind, but i feel like some of the reason you are worried is b/c you could potentially be the re-bound, but i don't know how long they were together or how serious they were.<br>  <br>  If it really bothers you and he is your boyfriend, then you should be able to say something. Or just buy a camera and take pictures of you guys together and make the captions rediculously obvious that he is your boy toy.|`|L6ha3uAiaa	If his profile picture is still them, asking him to change to one that is just him or with his buddies or you. You can also suggest he move the photos of her to different gallery like "Early 2008" instead of "Me and my sweetie-kins. MWAH!"<br>  <br>  Facebook is just as much about the enjoyable times people have had in the past as the ones they are having now. No need to become an overbearing girlfriend now just because there is proof that he dated someone before you!|`|f8rjxcOGaa	i think that it all depends on the guy...you know him better than i do so think about what his reaction would be if you sat him down and talked about this issue. maybe bring it up in a joking way? i think there is a reason why they haven't been taken down though. and i think you should definitely consider all your options for example he didn't think of it as a big deal because he thought you would know he was over her. or maybe that he still kinda has something for her.|`|IXBztKn4aa	It may not be a big deal, my friend has pictures of her and her ex still on facebook and they had a really nasty break up. If it really bothers you talk to him about it but don't be too offendended if he says he doesn't think it's a big deal.|`|1Xjudzg9aa	I know that it is difficult because I would feel the same way.

You need to get over it, it's not a big deal, he has a picture of his ex? Big deal, this doesn't mean that he doesn't want to be with you!  If he didn't love you why would he be with you? Think about it! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! xx|`|yIE6bpCsaa	girl i would ask him about it but wouldn't go up to him in a bad way just calm and collected. and if if gets anger about it i think you should keep your eye on him. but just take it slow you guys have only been together 2 months.|`|pCEDXEoVaa	As long as its not as a profile picture i would not worry about it i have pictures of my ex and i on there just not my profile picture.

4EWCegiRaa	It's decision time:  Either split up or get over your history.  I don't think you can get over your history or else you would have.  I mean, you're staring a breakup in the face and you STILL can't get over the past.  I know it's hard and frustrating but sometimes you just have to break up... that's the way these things go.|`|bbIsS6yaaa	pray to jesus <br>  |`|MZ8IBEvYaa	Getting over the past is really hard what more if you're trying to conquer it? You're not gonna win ever with the past, why? Because you can't do anything about it, it's all over and done. If you really love him, you need to trust him. If you're still mad about everything that he did and if you feel that you can't forgive him there's no sense in staying with the relationship. If you really want to get over it, give your full trust.|`|H6N3IPYmaa	There is only 2 things you can do. 1. Accept it or 2. leave him alone.<br>  If you accept what he has done then that's it. You shouldn't bring it up anymore. If you don't accept it then leave him alone. Love will blind you. If he loved you her wouldn't have hurt you and made you push him away. Good Luck|`|XxPb7zZKaa	talk it out now because if u dont then u ll be saying negative stuff about him and he' ll do the same it better that u guys talk it out no matter what and how bad it might hurt or seem and then try work it out and let go of the past if that dont work then time to move on the more we keep depending on the past the more we missed out on life  peace with love|`|4OTJFrIGaa	If it was possible to get over how he hurt you then you would have already done that.

feDTAydDaa	No, you just have a crush. And us girls can get a little obsessive when we really like someone. Anyone who says otherwise is LYING.<br>  <br>  But next time don't poke fun at him, even if you're joking it will still hurt his ego. Guys are just like that...|`|d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	There is a fine line between stalking and showing interest in some one.<br>  <br>  Wanting to know if some one likes you doesn't make you a stalker.  <br>  <br>  If you get obsessed with a person to the point where it becomes a huge obsession then yes I would question carefully. <br>  <br>  The last thing you want to do is get all crazy over some one who may just like you as a friend.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't know what he personally feels about you but I would be careful in opening up about your feelings right away.<br>  <br>  Get to know him as a friend first and see how that develops and if it develops into a friendship then maybe it could grow into some thing more?<br>  <br>  That all depends on how interested you both are in each other.  Don't give up if all he wants is a friendship because there are always others out there.  :-)
rDe0ZjDeaa	i think when its not reciprocated its more of a being "smitten" with somebody...like you like wat they say, how they act, how they look...but to be in love is to feel that same love in return and feel what the other person is feeling between you...having hard times and situations that don't scare you because you have your constant next to you or to help you or to say, hey i'll be here...how can you be in love with somebody who doesn't feel the same, even when i say it, it just doesn't make sense, enamored maybe, or obsessed to the point where the thought of them makes you euphoric, but keep in mind sumtimes its one particular thing that makes us "in love" w/sumbody who doesn't feel the same...|`|8f6d02015883c88cb46972f6ac5bd5ddaa	love is a one way mirror. its better if its two way, but that is just not always the case.|`|ZbNcfA1laa	Yup [=<br>  you dont have to truely know someone to fall for them.<br>  <br>  people may think its stupid and cant be done<br>  buts it true<br>  x|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	you can be truly in love with a person and want to be with them for ever.

3CLLxK80aa	It's not wrong to look at someone.  You can't make him cheat.  He has to want to cheat.  If he cheats, it's on him.  Ultimately, you can't really make anyone do anything they don't want to do.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you hear about forcing and manipulation, but that's not what you're doing.  That's not even close to what you're doing.  If he's a "very special soul," then he wont cheat.  If he wont cheat, then there isn't a problem.  If you're making him uncomfortable, I'm sure he'll let you know.<br>  <br>  I doubt he finds you annoying, or he would have said something by now.  You said you've been interested in him for a year.  That's a long time to look at someone.  If he didn't like it, he would have confronted you by now.<br>  <br>  If someone looks at me, I'll look at them.  Does it mean I like them?  Not necessarily.  It just means I noticed they're looking at me.  I may be curious as to why they're looking at me.  If they're smiling, I'll probably just assume they like me.  Usually that's a good thing.  If anything, he's probably flattered that you like him.  It usually feels good, to know someone likes you.  I don't know if he likes you back, but he probably likes, that you like him.<br>  <br>  See, you came up with either a positive or a negative, but you ignored the possibility that their is a neutral.  It may be that he does like you, but he may also just have neutral feelings about you.  Part of that may be, because he's seeing someone.  It doesn't sound like he has negative feelings for you, so that's good.<br>  <br>  You aren't doing anything wrong.  Honestly, I suggest you talk to him and befriend him.  I don't mean in some insinceer attempt to steal him away.  I mean, actually get to know him, and allow him to get to know you.  Work on actually becoming friends.  Teenage romances tend to be temporary, and if you really like this guy, then your best bet for dating him, is to get to know him.  Even if you never date, it's always nice to make new friends.  Chances are, if you like him, you may like one of his friends too, so even if he's not an option, perhaps they are.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's odd to be looked at, nor do I think it's annoying, that is, unless they do something else that is annoying.  I would look at anyone, who I notice looking at me.  It's called being observant and being friendly.  It's perfectly fine to have a crush.  Enjoy your crush.<br>  <br>  The fact is, you don't really know him that well.  Get to know him, at least as a friend.  Yeah, that may be awkward, but so what?  You'll do lots of stuff in life that's awkward.  After you get to know him, you'll either like him even more, or you'll figure-out, that he's not the guy you thought he was, but at least you'll know for sure.<br>  <br>  The fact is, I've made friends with women I've found attractive.  I didn't do it souly to date them, I did it, because I wanted to get to know them.  If it leads to dating, because they feel the same way about me, that I do about them, great, but it's also nice to just make new friends.  Having guy friends will give you valuable experience when it comes to communicating with men.  If you're attracted to the guy, the experience is all the more valuable.  You have to learn these skills someplace, so rather than make mistakes in romances, why not practice communicating with friends?  Guy friends are also valuable, because you'll learn what sort of activities guys enjoy.  You'll better understand them, and you'll help learn what type of guys you're really attracted too?  Sure, superficially you like this guy, but it's only superficial, because you don't know him that well yet.  It's always good to find-out what things you like, and what things you don't, and you do that by getting to know a wide range of people.  So, rather than dating tons of guys, make friends with them.|`|092bea1320ac52f2f7cd0e47cb63f9e5aa	stay clear dear! tm... seriously listen to your self.. you are amking yourself feel guilty for the feeling you have... if you make yourself feel guilty then stop... your innerself is telling you something... why does no one ever listen to their innerselves anymore??!|`|LyiRHRAJaa	too long can u just summarise it<br>  <br>  now thats what u call hot!!!!<br>  <a href="http://d.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/ng/sp/empics/20080428/03/1471656224-soccer-barclays-premier-league-birmingham-city-v-liverpool-st-andrew.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://d.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/ng/sp/emp...</a>|`|NTyAGxhjaa	my opinion is look all you want just do any thing else because then that is really wrong but if he breaks up with girlfriend and it's not because of u and u 2 get to gather then it was meant to be|`|gmXvrbhoaa	you can look at the menu,but you can't have the main course!|`|i45nJjWyaa	lets flip this one around, ok this guy is staring at you and......? hmmmm, get the picture? golden rule and all that ****.

It is easier to blame you than look at himself. Don't hold on too tight. It may suprise him if you just let go. <br>  <br>  Talk to him and say "I can't force you to love me. I can't force you to stay. You will do what you want, you always have. If you want to leave then leave but don't expect to come back. My heart can only be broken once.

N2JkgQ4Uaa	You can "Be" with guys, doesn't mean you've slept with any of them<br>  <br>  You can just possibly tell him (if the subject arrises) that you have had boyfriends but nothings happened much which is telling the truth and if he asks why not just say why not, I am assuming it is because you wern't ready for a relationship.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You can just say you haven't had a boyfriend ever<br>  <br>  I think from what you're saying you're not exactly going "YA I'VE SLEPT WITH LOADS OF GUYS" so you're not exactly doomed from your white lie you just need to clear it up (perhaps using my exscuse) then just don't lie again because it can get you in a tricky hole|`|TR69skqaaa	no...you ok....just tell him you been with 3 guys....or tell him the truth..ok|`|4d52hvrZaa	well the earlier u tell him the truth the earlier u wont feel bad every single day|`|c4882b668d1cc93910bb73fdb27671baaa	It doesn't matter. I think you'll find an awful lot of people exaggerate their sexual experience one way or another. Forget it. He won't know unless you tell him.|`|P9inKWOaaa	when chicks havent been with anyone, thats a ******* goldmine. my girl told me she lied and she hadnt been with anyone after telling me she had. i stuffed her on the spot.|`|DkvY8mOaaa	you havent lied  -  but if you feel guilty then just explain the situation! i'm sure he'll be relieved!|`|3fOFbz5Taa	Tell the truth, better in long run !!!!!!!!!!|`|2F8MGbbqaa	in my experience, guys like it when their girl is not very experienced because then they don't have to worry about whether they are better or worse than the other guys and it makes them feel better about themselves. Since you have already said to him that you have had a few guys, say to him that you haven't had that many guys but it never really got that far, but that wasn't your choice. <br>  I used to think that i had to lie about 'how far' id got but i just think its silly now really and i tell them the truth. They dont care if you havent done that much, honestly. It would probably boost their confidence and make them feel good about themselves if they know there hasn't been that many guys and he's one of them !<br>  <br>  Good luck and only do what you feel comfortable doing, don't let him pressure you into anything. Have fun :D|`|k48kgIFQaa	I know how you feel, everybody I know believes I am not a virgin =/<br>  It's a little worrying, yes, but he wont know unless you tell them.<br>  <br>  I don't really worry because I've only said I've done it once. So when it comes to doing it they wont expect much;)<br>  <br>  as you've said you haven't had bf's then you have no problem as they wont expect you to be a a relationship guru:)<br>  <br>  and even if you had a million, you still might not be any good with a relationship with this guy. so just don't worry about it and enjoy your first boyfriend:)|`|c9NuCZnaaa	Just, if it comes up again. tell him the story im sure he won't mind.<br>  Most men like girls with little experience. It leaves you with nothing to compare to him then and he gets to teach you the way HE likes things. <br>  <br>  Men don't always like sluts thankfully :)<br>  <br>  If he's a good guy for you he'll understand|`|iDqVy21gaa	Just say<br>  <br>  "You been with em"<br>  <br>  "But not all the way"<br>  <br>  : )<br>  <br>  What guy asks a young girl that question anyway?<br>  <br>  He's no gentleman is he? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What makes young girls lie to each other about having 'done it' with boys?  I never worked that out|`|BA0wMRuGaa	IF you ever get together tell him you lied as you thought inexperience would be abit of a turn off.

AA11848274	Remember there are no qualifications to being a parent.  Your mother sounds like she may be jealous or maybe your brother acts out after your gone.  Either way, your mother could be a little more understanding and explain why this occurring.  I suggest that you talk to your mom and let her know how you feel about what she said to you.  Try to not be defensive or attack her but be neutral.  Don't blame or try to hurt.  You're at the age where you are expected to naturally be anti-parent so either way, time will work this out.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's just your mother exerting her control over you. It's a bit mean, I know, but there's not a lot you can do about it.

Now you need to tell her that your going to see your brother tell her that she can't stop you because he's your brother and nothing should be holding you back from your family.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Either there is more to the story or there is something wrong with your mom! I hate to say that, but why in the world won't she let  you see him?<br>  I would keep after her. I would call her again. Tell her that you don't understand why she feels the way that she does and ask her to tell you.<br>  Let her know that whatever it is you will change it. Tell her that you love her and  your brother, and this whole situation is really bothering you.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	Your mom has some kind of a problem and its not you. I hope she gets help. In the mean time there is nothing you can do. Time changes things all thru your life and this will change too. You and your brother will be close again. As he gets a little older if you have the chance always tell him you love him and are there for him. He really needs to know that because I do not think your mother is very loving. |`|AA10423186	just  tell  here|`|ldY8DvsWaa	that's insane! i'd go on a rampage straight out if my mom did that?!

You can not decide who your boyfriend can be friends with. But you do have a right to interfere if you think there might be something going on, or if you're drifting. Tell him that you feel emotionally distant from him and that you're wondering if there's any way for you to reconnect. Assure him that you trust him, but you just want things to work out. It could even be as simple as going out to dinner or coffee so you can talk. Good luck!|`|009be2a6fe33e8445f71c08d72feeb81aa	You have to sit down with your bf and let him know how his relationship with his lady friend is making you feel.

That way everyone would get along.|`|AA12206782	No, you can't pick his friends, but you CAN bust his chops and tell him what you feel.|`|AA10002436	Did your boyfriend have this friend before you got together with him? If so, you took your boyfriend with all the baggage he has. He isn't some project that you sculpt into what you want. Did he get this friend after you got with him? If so, you let it go on too long, and it's probably too late for you to do anything about without seeming extremely bitter and catty.|`|AA12166616	First off,  I am sorry for the situation your in.  Second;  No, you cannot pick and choose your boyfriends friends,   how unfortunate.  But you can explain how you feel to him. Tell him exactly what you think about this problem. With any luck he will listen and understand.You cannot ban him from talking to her cause most likely he will do it anyways.  Good luck sugar xx|`|AA11358263	Stick with your feeling obviously you know some signs that something is happening. Tell him that you don't like the relationship that he has with her and he needs to end it because of the fact it is interfering with your relaationship. If he doesn't show any interest in ending their friendship some is most likely going on and they are not only friends. He should be more interested in your relationship then his friendship with her.|`|AA11435396	Trust your gut. When guys share emotions with other women, and it starts to take away from your own relationship, there is trouble with a capital T. I completely understand why you don't want to be the "bitchy girlfriend," and you sound really grounded. Good for you. But in all honesty, I think that talking with him is the right thing to do. Also, the other woman should know better than to bring your boyfriend into her personal life. Aquaintences are fine, emotional confiding in him is not. What he may not even realize yet, is that she may be a little to attatched to him. What do women look for while in a rocky relationship, or just after a break up? A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR. Like I said, your boyfriend may not be aware of it, but my guess is that something isnt right there. And sorry to bash my fellow women, but they can be hard to trust. Anyways, either way, if you want to remain close to your boyfriend, talk to him. Thats the only way for the attention to be where it belongs- with you, not with her. good luck sweetie.|`|AA12092917	the tittle you chose doesn't do you question justice. Because you don't have the right to pick his friends, however, people seem to forget that you don't have to have sex with someone to cheat.  There is such thing as emotionally cheating. If he has gotten to the  point where all of his emotional and communication needs are met by her  he is cheating in a since that he is going out of his relationship. He should not be allowing his friendship as such get in the way of your relationship. You shouldn't say anything things to him, rather you two should sit down and talk, let him know how you feel and why and find out whats going on with him, and then you two need two need to come up with a solution that's works for you two. If you and the female talk on a friend bases after talking to him, you might want to talk to her don't blame her for anything just tell her how you feel and express your concerns and ask for hers. After all you have a solid reason to be worried. Be sure to no point fingers or blame or accuse anyone, keep it PG and sweet.|`|b4e99e24e3f8fc0245b3628ef950c986aa	yes and if he doesnt agree then just go along with it and soon he will understand how you feel towards his friendship with the other girl and he will feel guilty and stop. But to me she sounds nice and if i were you i would take that into consideration.My gf has a boy for a friend and i trust her 100% although i get that same gut feeling you got i remember all the love notes she wrote me and all the times she said that she loved me and then i know that she wouldnt mess our relationship up for nothing.

Voil la jolie fable de La Fontaine qui explique pourquoi :  L'Amour et la Folie      "Tout est mystre dans l'Amour,   Ses flches, son carquois, son flambeau, son enfance:  Ce n'est pas l'ouvrage d'un jour  Que d'puiser cette science.  Je ne prtends donc point tout expliquer ici:  Mon but est seulement de dire,  ma manire,  Comment l'aveugle que voici   (C'est un dieu), comment, dis-je, il perdit la lumire;   Quelle suite eut ce mal, qui peut-tre est un bien  J'en fais juge un amant, et ne dcide rien.    La Folie et l'Amour jouaient un jour ensemble:  Celui-ci n'tait pas encor priv des yeux.  Une dispute vint : l'Amour veut qu'on assemble   L-dessus le conseil des Dieux;   L'autre n'eut pas la patience;   Elle lui donne un coup si furieux,  Qu'il en perd la clart des cieux.     Vnus en demande vengeance.  Femme et mre, il suffit pour juger de ses cris:  Les Dieux en furent tourdis,   Et Jupiter, et Nmsis,   Et les Juges d'Enfer, enfin toute la bande.  Elle reprsenta l'normit du cas;   Son fils, sans un baton, ne pouvait faire un pas:  Nulle peine n'tait pour ce crime assez grande:  Le dommage devait tre aussi rpar.  Quand on eut bien considr   L'intrt du public, celui de la partie,   Le rsultat enfin de la suprme cour   Fut de condamner la Folie   A servir de guide  l'Amour.

I thought more about sex than my heart, her heart. Now I realize what a waste of time that really is in life. I probably missed some of the best real relationships in life. I now look for truth fullness, sincerity and common goals. Someone I can respect and someone who will respect me. A lady I can talk to about anything. Some one who I can meet basically in the middle with. No matter how perfect a relationship, there will have to be some compromising from both. Yes, it has cut down the potential dating pool dramatically, but the few dates I go on are fulfilling, fun and educational. You can learn a lot from someone you realize there is no relationship potential by agreeing on that during the date. Now with the pressure off you can share experiences and laugh about it, you never know what may help the other person.

I say just go for it. If you get really nervous just think about the reward. Just walk up and blurt it out, don't worry abou the small talk it'll just make you more nervous.

Or, il ne faut pas le laisser faire ce qu'il veut sous couvert qu'il est jaloux.. Car la jalousie, c'est beau, c'est une preuve d'amour et qu'il tient a toi, quand c'est leger.. Si c'est une jalousie excessive, ca tue l'amour, et donc la relation...   Donc, il faut que tu saches quelles sont les limites que tu peux accepter venant de lui... Mais lui laisser fouiller ton sac ou lire tous tes messages, c'est abuse ! Enfin je veux dire, oui il peut le faire une fois, comme ca, par curiosite parce qu'il avait ton portable sous la main.. Mais il ne faut pas que ca devienne une habitude...   Et d'apres ce que tu dis, il ne te fait pas confiance alors que tu n'as rien fait... Le probleme c'est qu'on ne sait pas quel est ce probleme..   Sinon, tout depend du temps que vous avez ensemble.. Parce qu'une confiance, ca se gagne.. autant d'un cote que de l'autre.. Donc p-e a t'il seulement besoin de plus de temps afin de te faire totalement confiance.. P-e est ce aussi seulement la peur de s'attacher et d'etre ensuite decu qui le fait agir comme cela..

b15a1ce35ad47b4d01f45b0a14f5b682aa	when she asks you for $ all the time.  if she is more friendlier to your friends then you that I say would be a good sign|`|AA12296388	Ask her...Dont play the guessing game when it comes to your heart. You might regret it!!|`|802ce6675f85f11da775e5f2c71d9a49aa	if the relationship is all about her and nothing else if she is all about money or what she wants and never about seeing you happy then she is just playing you for what u can give her.  If she really loves u she would worry bout how u feel about things also.  If that is the case and the relationship is all about her and what she wants then i say drop her and fast get the hell outta there|`|AA11351541	If she makes you jump through hoops and she wants to play mind games all the time. Especially if she still flirts with other guys in front of you. Also, if she doesn't show or tell you how she feels.|`|d52d10f0f7910b65cda49e5a7fe9e452aa	I'm with shaunna m on this.  I mean, don't just say "are you playing with me?"  Find a more tactful way to put it, like, "where do you think our relationship is going?" or something like that.|`|d9ab400151d5d5c9cb7f274ca558d213aa	when you feel played. do you feel more like an ATM or a champion show dog (i.e. she's dating you for money or status)? is she saying weird things like "you know, if you want to see other women, it's ok with me" or "why can't you just (insert thing she wants to change)? you would if you cared about me"? I'd say there's some serious gaming going on, and you have no idea what the score is. If you don't feel like you can trust her, or you're starting to get the creepy feeling that she's slowly becoming your mom, and it's not in a good way, or you get the feeling that she cries or yells or has sex with you to get what she wants, I'd say it's time to run. far far away. (if you really want an in-depth psychoanalysis of the types of games you can see, I would suggest reading "games people play")    Good luck. and remember: if you don't want to be played, don't play.
AA11314617	Stop talking with them.  Some people are just complainers and you can't change them.|`|AA11867707	i hate neighbors like that. so well me and my family don't get along with our neighbors at all. so we just don't talk to them. ne ways they are all old people that don't like haveing neighbors that have kids. but who cares what they think right? No offense to any not so young people. Or you can do what my parents wanna do cuz our neighbor  don't like us... move. but i hope we don't move. i like it here no matter who likes me or not it my life not theirs.
AA11734112	It's because you demanded that she have no more friends.    This is too much to ask of someone you love. The problem is that you thought of her as a possession instead of a person. You demanded something of her she was unwilling to give up.   Now that it's over, it hurts. This is life. The hurt will fade, I promise, but now is your opportunity to use this experience to grow.   You need to examine why you feel the need to make your partners give up friendships. Is it a self-esteem issue? Is it that you are relating some other event with this unknowingly?    We all, when we are young, make unreasonable demands on ourselves and others. Going through these painful experiences gives us the opportunity to learn how to deal with our future relationships in a more mature way.   I know that right now, that all of this may seem unhelpful. You want to quit hurting and you want it right now.    The answer to that is, that you pick yourself up, find something to do, and you move forward. There is no panacea for the pain except for time and experience.|`|9c4d094a6c15addcbc5ed98dd4e25388aa	communicating as in how?  is she still seeing them?  If so, then this is not worth it.    whatever you do in  a realtionship, dont ever tell a girl to get rid of all her friends, that will only make her think that you are trying to own her.  that will stop a relationship dead cold.    on the other hand, if she is still trying to keep an old boyfriend, then i can understand your concern, the only way is to really sit her down and have a really long chat with her.  ask her her true feelings for you and to clear the air, ask her if she still has feelings for her ex.  tell her that you just have to know where you stand in this.  it's not fair of her to keep you on a string dangling and waiting for her to come to you.    all in all, talk to her.  it's the only way you will ever know.|`|49a7876e36acba7210a4271e6d5e55edaa	You need to let go. Since you just broke up, you can take time to grieve and such. But don't grieve for months because then you'll just annoy your friends.    The first step is to accept the breakup has happened.  Then remove things from your life that remind you of your ex.
AA11055594	Depends what you mean exactly by "dating". . . . .|`|0f1ecc12f317e7df7c26c5cb804b9acaaa	If you love him, why take a break?|`|AA11649785	Are you 12?|`|fe0328d7c67b8dcbf45ff1b46ed4f12aaa	hey. dont play around with your realtionship like that.     if you broke up for a good reason leave it like that. but if the feelings mutual dont let your love go.|`|349ddfc2af3ae7ab44eb31c2fa7651f5aa	If you "love" him, why did you want to take a break????|`|AA10091436	Only you can say if enough time has passed by in order for you to feel comfortable with the changes. I would suggest sitting down and writing a list or a paragraph about the reasons why you decided to "take a break" in the first place.     Secondly, ask yourself (or an impartial, trustworthy friend) if you have actually solved the issues that caused you to break it off. Instinctively, you knew you needed some "down time" to get your thoughts together, and you asked for the time.. but did you use it properly, or did you just pine for him the whole time?    Also, think about the reason(s) why you want to get back together. Do your reasons fall along the lines of desperation, loneliness, neediness, etc.? Or do they have to do with the fact that you have come to an understanding about certain important issues in your life, you have learned something, and you are ready to give the best part of yourself to someone else?    Only you can say. Good luck.|`|AA11473231	Call him and tell him that you miss him. If he does't suggest getting back together ... wellll.... that pretty much says it all.  Good luck|`|AA12281149	hmmmm  if you real love him you can't stand a break away from him|`|f3ae982f11670647b470625ad13ec168aa	What was your reasoning for the break - usually it's that you had other interests...|`|bb8b2be5de42c44075abc8196118f8acaa	why dont you propose,maybe he is waiting for you!!|`|AA12050661	if you love him i don't understand the break , it will only make you far from each author ,Boothe of you will have the time to think on this relation in a different way saw be careful maybe this break will cues a break up
9892ac179aa6190b1b108db3b8e3113aaa	I have bine in this place too!!! My soon to be husbend has liked me for 4 years and loved me for 4 years and i wanted to be with him but i was with someone that i thought i loved then he went fare away from me and then i relised that i loved him and i never told him this untill 2 years later and i regret it then i got away from the one i was with and know i am with the guy that has loved and liked me for 4 years and we are getting married november 11th now so what i am telling you is to let him know how you fell about him befor it is to late!!!!! and to let you know age is just a number my soon to be husbend is 34 and i am 21 years old!!!! so if you like him that much then age should not stop you at all!!!!!|`|AA11607230	Follow your heart.  You know what you want to do.|`|AA11299834	Age is not a problem, my wife of almost 10 years is 5yrs older than I am, the problem is that he is with another woman.  I think it is appropriate if you tell him that if he finds himself single again that you would like to date him!  Then let time take its toll, he might be wanting to break it off with this girl anyway and just needs a shove.  If not, keep your options open and maybe you find someone better!|`|4f4a53257cab2af8c1ea7c57959b591eaa	dont ignore it go for him|`|AA12162653	I think you need to be brutally honest and let him know how you feel.  He might truly be waiting for you who knows until you ask|`|67f194979ed504f5c2ed78f3ff6a3877aa	Doesn't sound like age is a problem...... but I think if he really had true feelings for you he would be with you not anybody else.|`|AA12330178	I WOULD TAKE THAT CHANCE AND GO FOR IT..YOU BOTH WANT IT SO DO IT ..IT COULD BE THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO BOTH OF YOU..DONT PASS THIS CHANCE UP BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT GET ANOTHER ONE.......GET HIM GIRL|`|AA12333866	i dont know wat to say    forget him i will give u all the care and love u need|`|AA11660966	make the first move. maybe this will impulse him to brake up with his gf.|`|cc74dfdd50e575c62b9f39eaceed730faa	If he feels the same about you as you do him, then go for!!!! Why deny yourself the company of the person that you want to be with! And by the way age doesn't matter. Yeah, Good Luck!|`|ae8f0b3e1753a2aad7dffd6ecbf361aeaa	You being the more mature person just need to straight up tell him how you feel and what is it that he wants..you should be able to have a gut feeling on what will happen.. then go from there, continue being cautious..good luck!

AA11806807	its not agenst the law|`|AA10421757	As long as she has her parents permission and they don't want to press charges if things get sexual then it's ok....but they can always change their minds later.|`|AA10373401	2 years age difference is OK.  just don't go beyond that.|`|e3158ccdbfab8dd5f7aef98de7e69f75aa	he's not over 18 so i would assume that it's alright esp since you have parents permission.
bbce6950ecd4aa7e9ebb12ae905e8888aa	you better get some confidence boy.  its time to be a man and start selling yourself like a salesman.  i recommend hanging out with a guy who gets a lot of women and mimick his style.  be cool.  be funny and only let her laugh at your jokes. you should laugh at her jokes if she ever tells one.  watch george clooney in interviews and his movies.  he's slick and a major player.  james bond style always works.  rent those movies and try to be like him.  you'll be alright player.|`|AA11588361	just be yourself. that's normal|`|AA11816396	Be yourself|`|189a3c964438b5c4b650f7162f8c0142aa	Be a bit complicated and always feel free to talk with girls. dont be afraid even i felt the same. Just some how try to talk with her and things will role up normally.   Good luck|`|182fc0612806006ee0110238999c79a7aa	Go for it!  Start by being polite when you approach her, look her in the eye and smile (even though you're nervous, she'll appreciate your willingness to conquer your fear for her). Invite her to do something she likes, or if you don't know what she likes, invite her to do something you like. And if you're not sure about going out alone, ease the pressure with a group activity, but let her know that it obviously wouldn't be as fun without her. Try your best to walk away with her number (if you don't have it already) and get it right, offer her yours! Some girls feel uncomfortable sharing but don't just leave her with your number, you want to pursue so pursue! First dates where you don't have to talk much can help depending on the girl. Lastly, get comfortable talking about yourself (practice if you like). No one likes to feel interviewed. This way you won't fear long gaps in conversation. You can volunteer a little about you then ask about her, win-win. Invest in a good, subtle cologne and enjoy! (At least this works for me!)|`|AA11751911	you dont have to get frightened to talk to them, afterall they are not beasts or animals that they will eat you up!!!
2589758540e013a77c4bbe8944ae7635aa	don't be afraid of telling the truth to the girls bec. girls like courting them.joke but its true.anyway just tell your own idea or i mean is, your own way.i know they like you too but you are afraid of showing as you.right.and i know that your own way is the best.i hope i ans. your question.|`|AA10749641	try asking her out|`|AA11749656	just go and ask her DUH!!|`|9044c83cbed8bc19c817b3a413304ec9aa	you be your self and don't lie to them about any thing and don't get geeky in front of them while your talking
AA10760147	He would have to check it out with the person in charge of his case.  Even though he will be turning 17, I believe that he would have to be 18 to make a decision like that without checking with someone.  Your parents would probably have to sign a statement saying that they agree with letting him move back with you.|`|AA12372761	You would need to check into this. I definently would!! I was adopted by my aunt and wanted to go live with my mom when I was 16, she wouldn't let me and I have had problems with rejection ever since. It is hard enough being given up, muchless when you want to go back being told no.|`|AA11611006	ASK YOUR LAWYER!!|`|868ec2947fefec9700fcd6a85ddedb98aa	YES. COME ON. HE OBVIOUSLY MISSES YOU IF HE WANTS TO COME AND STAY.|`|3dfb201377614485b8a127a6fa44ab0aaa	That's a loaded question.  Why did they adopt him in the first place?  Why does he want to move out?    Legally, I suppose he can.  But you'd know whether that really is the best thing for him.|`|AA11083427	It depends on what State you or your son lives in. In some States, 17 years old is a legal age to determine where he wants to live. You need to check your local law before this happens so you nor your biological son gets into any trouble because of the decision.|`|cdd303b29c40f6a6af75bf0362ffbfd3aa	In Texas it is- but he has to stay in school. Not sure where you're from but the problem with the situation becomes your parents. TECHNICALLY- they are still financially responsible for him until he is 18. So, if he gets into trouble it becomes their issue-Not yours because they are his legal guardians. Make sure it's an amicable split if he does decide to move back in with you, not just because you'll be the 'cool' parent.
bcbd792d199f7ebc897cc33f37ad366caa	From age six to thirty  It was just me and my mom  She was always around  When I came home.    She read me great books  And taught me great things  Like how to be good  To get toys Santa brings.    At seven she bought me a truck  That I like,  At eight a big 14 inch Purplish/green bike.    At nine I remember being a bully in school  She whipped me that day  I really felt like a fool.    My tenth birthday party was so much fun  So many girls were invited  But there was a special one.    Mom took us to the movies when I was eleven  Mom sat seats away  So I was in heaven.    Twelve was an exciting year for me  I started high school  Then we moved to the city.    So many places  I loved every scene,  The skyscrapers amazed me  When I was thirteen.    At fourteen and fifteen  I ran track in school  Won lots of medals  Broke not a rule.    High school came quick  She came back in my life then,  The girl that I met  At my party at ten.    The subjects were tough  Mom helped me alot,  I give her much credit  For the A's the I got.    We dated through high school  Mom met her kin,  I was so happy with the  Relationship I was in.    Ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelvth grade  I was seventeen at last,  What a life I had lived  As I thought of my past.    I thought about college  Right after high school,  But instead joined the Army  Which I still think is cool.    Boot camp at 18  Two years in Korea  My girl was sad  But shed not a tear.    At 20 we married  I was so happy that day  Mom looked so beautiful  When she gave me away.    Ten years later  Six kids and a pet  Now that I'm 30  How good can life get.

1234cbd1d5e1ae930f23181bda033024aa	No way. Every relationship i've gone through has made me a stronger person, and i'd imagine the same is true for you as well. As we go through our relationships, we gain maturity, and heartbreak is the cost. If we could go back in time and change things, we would avoid all of that heartbreak, but we would also lose all of the lessons that it has taught us about ourselves and about the world around us. And at the end of the day, that heartbreak has better prepared you to recognize what you truly cherish in a person. Only by getting your heart broken can you learn not to take a person for granted. And besides, what does it matter if you've said those three words in the past? All that matters is whether or not you mean it the next time you say it.|`|13f417f528203da84054f369770f2ea0aa	you are so right man....if i could i would take them back just because i know now that the man i live with is the person i love i feel things for him that i havent ever felt before....but i can honestly say I Love my boyfriend with all my heart well Jesus Christ first.|`|AA11992413	No. Each person that I've told those 3 words to, I meant it...just in a different way. Besides, words are words. The proof is in your actions. When I met my current bf, I told him I love him like you love a child - regardless of his faults. But I loved, and still love my child's father cause he gave me something no one else ever did and without him - there would be no her. And I loved my exhusband even though he was a jerk. I think the main thing to remember is not to say it just because someone else does 1st. Saying "I love you" is a staement, not a question to be answered.|`|AA11967385	I think that ur opinion is so much like mine i think the way you think. I mean throwin the words i love u is like saying another hello to a boss or a friend when you pick up ur phone. U are a great philosopher.

If she is a good Mom, she will just sit there and wait for you to say it. She might try to reassure you to give you courage to say it.

b9cdb6e625634d3143a22982ffbc316daa	How long a couple should wait depends entire upon the couple.      Your age is an important factor. If you're in your teens, it's best to wait longer - somewhere in the months to years arena. Young'uns just don't have the experience dealing with people to make decisions like that quickly. Take enough time to get to know the person well enough - whether or not they're worthy of you is not a decision to be taken lightly.    Your outlook on this kind of thing is another factor. If you see sex as a monumental expression of devotion to another person, you should wait longer. If you see sex as just another physical process, waiting isn't as important.    If you're confident that you actually _want_ to have sex and you're comfortable with the implications, go ahead - have fun. If not, take some time to think about it.|`|2985e6f696ddc72d2ba7fb7b946880bcaa	i think 2 to 3 years but its has to be true love,im not going to wait until im married im might not evening get married,just try to enjoy life if u dont want sex than dont have it ,dont make anyone pressure u into it,same thing around,i enjoy life and i love every sec about it about me still being a virgin,i hate that,i think if two people were meant to be than its not a sin to have sex before marriage.................|`|ea1e61ab263169f059f9bb59553aca83aa	I think they should wait until they both find out if they are in love or wait till they get marriage if you love and respect each other decision you can wait.|`|2644259d7de8478d97da5240b024af35aa	two years.|`|11e14241a0df1e5588237eecd51a6069aa	depends on the people but I'd say at least 2 months|`|471409172b5d1ec863c358234ddecfefaa	There is no correct number.  You need to decide if you even want to go down that path.  Manogamy is important not just from a religious and social aspect, but more importantly from a life or death perspective.  Remember that you (effectively) have sex with every person your partner has had sex in the past with.  Herpes NEVER goes away and AIDS KILLS.  Condoms are around 65% effective from preventing pregnancy (and thus you are risking your life.)    I'm sorry to sound like such a bummer, but why not wait for marriage and a clean person that gives themselves to you ONLY.    OTHERWISE, wait until you feel ready to give your body to him.|`|50b8f94f39818a9a52007f2735dceb8caa	2 months get to know the person also after being test|`|AA10146971	depends on the age of the people...adults...15 minutes, under 21...2 years|`|AA11865230	when the girl is ready but a bit of patience is good JUST to see if the guy can respect n wait ...... besides girls that easily sleep with men .... the men tend not to take them seriously|`|05719e8c331ddff51968a6a1b1d9a815aa	not sure have you got your first kiss yet?|`|6f77253cc43bb8573bf03650807d05a0aa	That depends.

Women's shelters are NOT listed int he phone book or advertised. You have to go through your local law enforcement agency to get to them. Call your local police and tell them you need to get out of your immediate situation and right away and that you need to go to a woman's shelter. An officer will come to get you while the department calls ahead to the location to announce your pending arrival. They will be ready for you when you get there. Police officials are the only ones outside of employees and current or former residents that know the location of actual sites and NO-ONE is allowed to disclose said information so calling the police is the ONLY way to go about it. good luck and PLEASE do it right away before the worst happens. DO not stay in that situation even one minute longer! Love and best wishes to you!

You've not had a "proper" relationship with them, you haven't lived with them, discovered their annoying habits, been through rough times with them.    Obviously they could be the love of your life, but think very carefully about what you have before you throw it all away.

4k5MkmInaa	That's true for a lot of women,including me.    I get frustrated sometimes,because i wouldn't know if i like a guy just because he's interested in me or whether im actually interested in him.    for me,its the fear of rejection.    it's different for everyone,some girls like the guys to make the first moves.|`|AA11806027	because today's women have no idea what they want.

gO9tl2uhaa	You need to break the ice subtly. You're shyness shouldn't matter (if you're shy and can't overcome it, don't expect to break any barrier anytime soon).    Anyhow! yeah subtle! and don't over do it. So, for instance, you see him talking to someone or just watching something, you walk toward him and put your hand on his back instead of just ''poking him'' twice. You don't let your hand there for an hour. Just a 5-10 seconds. (it needs to be automatic in your brain, not prepared).    Also, when he makes a joke, that's a great moment to touch him. He makes a joke about you; you can gently push his shoulder or stroke his forearm (although the stroking his more sensual - less subtle and very cliche =P ...but still very good (trust me!)).     The keywords here are GENTLY and feminine; you don't wanna act like guys act when making fun of each others. GENTLE! (i HAVE to use the emphasis cause I know so many girls who are attracted to a guy, but she'll poke him hard or slap him. even if it doesn't really hurt a guy, it's not feminine, therefore not attractive (in most cases))    And of course you can hug him. But not too often (like the other moves). Maybe once a week or something like that or else, you'll seem too attached and clingy.     Finally, you can do (AGAIN, not too often) the poking. If you have a class with him and sit next to him AND he's focused on the class, just poke him. Be playful! It's fun (when you don't do it every 5mins) and it breaks the touching barrier. I use that trick myself. I'll poke and pretend nothing happen. It works both sides!|`|5LEE91CGaa	just touch him....in a place that isn't too private|`|cmFU81rQaa	When he makes you laugh touch him on the arm.|`|k0WxrxKRaa	give him a high 5 when he does something good. or when he says something funny touch his hand and laugh. or something like that that's what i do :)

Think about these Q's and then call her.  Just say that you want to get back together with her, and she sounds very very willing.    She is giving you hints, and if you don't respond, then she will grow tired and move on.    Is there something holding you back??    Don't waste lots of time.  She sounds amazing.

Just remain friends with benefits that way either way you're not trapped and neither is she.|`|yxinxA2daa	She still likes you. She feels that sexuality is her only way of getting you back. Once you go back to her, for sex or whatever, she's going to try to pull into her hole and make you fall you all over again.  &therefore you'll be boyfriend and girlfriends all over again.    Honestly, stop being her friend. Stop making contacts with her for a good month or so and let both your heart heal. After both your heart has heal off, become friends again.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	she still likes you and wants you back. you need to decide if you want to get back with her.|`|Qc3nCsXnaa	She is trying to lure you back, if you feel that it wasn't a good relationship then, it wont be now...In fact it will probably end up being worse if you "come over."  Be a true friend, and she will appreciate and respect you in the long run.  Otherwise you will send the message that you still want to be with her and love her, when that might very well not be the case....and things just get crazy from there.....i Know personally lol...u dont want the right...especially when the other girl u like finally comes...|`|AA86ypBaaa	She obviously wants you backk dudeee.  its a girl thing we do, i guess we try to give a guy a message telling them that we still want you but we try to do it in a less noticable way or even sexually i guess.  I mean its bery noticable to me what shes trying to do.  But yeah if you dont like her anymore jsut ask her look um for the pasy few days, weeks, month,(however long this has been going on) I get the feeling that your tying to tell me you want to get back with me. If she says noo then just go okay just wanted to make sure i wasnt getting the wrong message from you, and if she does say yes then if you dont lik eher anymore just tell her you dont like her and perfer to stay friends|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	she wants you back- if you want her back, then go for it, if not, tell her to stop messing with your mind.|`|24fjUKaVaa	She wants you back. It seems kind of obvious. If you want her back then ask her out. She said if you asked she would and if you dont want her back then tell her it's getting a little awkward.|`|tbBU24M0aa	she could be giving you signs. She wants to get back with you if you wanted to. If you don't and this is anoying you, you must say something like, ok, we are just friends. idk, but if you want to get back with her, then i guess she would probably say yes
cSaRk1Ygaa	I have SO been there. Eventually I cracked... I told her that the way she was treating was really rude and mean. She sort of tried to laugh it off, but everyone else thought the same, I haven't talked to her since unless I had to, and that was four years ago. Tell them all how you don't like to be left out, let them know instead up bottling it up!|`|AA10941788	Sweetie, If you feel she is using her then get rid of her  No one should have to put up with that  Find a better friend|`|wYTDwWnEaa	Shes not a real friend.. In highschool, you'll eventually find out who your real friends are.|`|ixHwF4apaa	all the persons are self centered. they really of more concerned about their benefits of for their need. it is natural. but a true friend is different. he wont be of that type. select your true friend. these are passing clouds. ignore live normally.

ZvlSwC9Qaa	About as often as us white women get frustrated with Men, no matter what color
Ir51Eb0Kaa	No it's not.|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	It was for me but everyone is different.|`|YGvKisOoaa	i'm not sure, since I am only 14, but if you've been dating the person for a long time and pretty much belong together, than I say go for it. My friend's parents got married at 18, had five kids, and got a divorce. But they weren't really ready for it. My sister has been dating the same guy for five years and she's 20, and I have faith that if she did get married right now (though she wont, shes still in college) that her and the guy would most likely stay together.    It all depends on you and your boyfriend. Best of luck with whatever you decide (:|`|tsdHndRhaa	it depends on who you are as a person, although 20 is very young you can still have a long lasting relationship and it is understandable also if your not ready to be committed like that right now.|`|V8uvefQDaa	Im 20 now. Met and moved in with my boyfriend at 17. I am currently planning our wedding.    When I first moved in with my hubby to be, everyone said that I was to young and that it will never work. I feel I have proved them wrong.    If you love your partner and you feel ready then why not. It is not easy and you will often wonder if you did the right thing but I don't regret what I did.     Just remember that you are only 20 and you must have fun. Don't let ur 20's pass you by just because you have chosen to settle down.    Good Luck!|`|96zZlJVYaa	you mean getting married? my answer would be yes, that is my opinion. I know many will said they love their partner so much while dating. But once they make that commitment everything thing change. The best thing is to do for yourself is to finish school (college), get yourself a good job, establish yourself, and date around before you settle down. I would think 27 is a mature age for most people.|`|khJBfboRaa	I got married at 18 and stayed with my man for 24 years.|`|paquf4dFaa	I don't know, do you want his kids? Do you still want to date other men & have fun?|`|FyhzmgRUaa	maybe, depending on the couple. i am 20 i have thought about it but i would have to lay out what i would be gaining and losing and if the connection of love is truly there cause nowadays their is that individual in the relationship that has a bit of uncertainty.|`|mHiCKHo0aa	Im gettin married, Im 21, and my lady is 20|`|lsFDEx2oaa	All depends on you.  If you feel mature enough to do so, then no.  Just remember though, there's still more experiences to live before settling down and you might miss out on them.|`|ounWvY70aa	My parents got married when they were 17 & 19    They're still together now and in their 40's|`|RNZaUdxSaa	not at all.. I am also 20 and engaged we planned for a baby, I had a miscarriage... I am very mature for my age.. so I mean if you have your life in order and on the right track and your ready for it..one problem is its hard to find a guy the same age ready to settle down! So if you find one who is ready for the same thing then go for it!!  fortunately I found one and im happy as ever! best of luck!|`|wNSI1wdCaa	Well it is for me. I am 23 and still not ready to settle down.|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	i would like to shake cherry pie's hand because that's just amazing and no 20 is not to young to settle down|`|jf1oPsSeaa	17 is too young to settle down. if youre really in love and you want to be with that person, then go for it because 20 is not.|`|eH6hoKgEaa	you settle down when you feel ready to settle down. personally 20 isn't too young.|`|b490c76dca3f43fb1bc6059f95de1004aa	definately ...theres lot,s to do before settling down...by the time you get to 25 you will be wishing you had,nt..are you working..go and get some more education..go to college....i was married at 19....married for a long time..but these days it,s  different...|`|8p31dENPaa	It is for me.

w0ZqjJBtaa	I'm not sure about other countries but in England, you do have access to family therapy which is free; as well as a six week counselling service that most G.P surgeries offer now. If not, you can only continue doing what you are doing. Love them but don't make excuses for the father. Children take in a lot and they will see one day that mummy is the only one making the effort. He'll regret it when it's too late. It will be natural fot them to act out and get angry at you and others. They need to be able to express this. Just love them. You cannot be held responsible for what the 'father' does or does not do.|`|AA10531094	Talk to an attorney to see what your options are.  Good Luck!|`|zdpp7cubaa	I grew up without a father. He was here and there in my life, but not there on a regular basis. When I was little I used to cry for him and I thought he didn't love me and it made me a very sad child. At one point, I even felt my mother was keeping me from him. Then, I grew up and learned who my father really was as a person. I thank God everyday that my mother was strong enough to be my mother and my father and everything I needed. I never wanted for anything. It did made me sad as a child, but now that I'm adult I would like to say I turned out fine. It's just going to be hard right now, but trust me it will get better. I will keep you in my thoughts.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	wow this even stumpt me .. i dont know what to say to this .. im really sorry to hear this ... i know what your kids are going through though .. my mom took me and all me siblings away from my dad for 2 years and i didnt see him till i was in 7th grade... it was very hard for me and i acted out all the time .. i would run away from home and try to get to my dads house (i was a daddys girl) and after so many years you get used to it .. now im 18 and can visit my dad whenever ... i think all you need to do is give it some time .. i think tell them the truth would help alot better than lieing ...
KkSW6EViaa	um...  that's nice?    don't keep trying to get over him, if he was your first love then chances are you probably never will. you'll just move on & hold on to those fond memories of him.    :]|`|KifasiMraa	Writing this stuff out is a good way to expel these feelings.  I write country songs when I go through a break up.  I would stay away from him though.  Trying to talk to him or be around him (even if he wants to be around you) will only make it harder to get over him.  Talk to a close friend.  They'll probably be willing to point out everything wrong about him and you can have a good laugh about it.  And go out and try to meet some new guys.  Don't go out with the intention of finding a boyfriend, you're not ready for that much commitment.  Just let some people flirt with you.  Flirt with some people.  It will make you feel good and help you picture being with someone else, even if its not in the near distant future.  Above all, just accept that getting over love takes time and commitment. You have to choose to move on.  Don't choose to wallow.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	OKay....|`|QjavEeQXaa	Try to let go. My mom is trying to also let go of someone else. Maybe if you talked to him you can remember how much of a pain he was.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	u have to move on. if u have doubts about how someone felt about u, then don't try and go back to them. he's moved on, so you should do the same. sorry he's sick.|`|cb10953b2f0dad5e0861aa07228435e5aa	Um, it sounds like you have left your hope in a guy that you thought you might spend your entire life with. I know how that feels... well, not really, but that seems like what we all want to hear when we are in pain... that and that it is all going ot be alright. But the truth of the matter is that it will probably naw away at you for quite a while until you will finally get over this guy and find better. You may have thought he would be the one and it just isn't what God and destiny and all that has set out for you. So, make one of the hardest goals and decisions of your life and move on. But don't do it by yourself. Your gonna need help. I know that. You know that.

If you want to be WITH him, I think you should try and get with him. If it doesn't feel the same then that's because it's not and it probably never will again. And if that's the case, then when you go to work every morning and you get the feelings that you used to have, relish them. Remember the way you loved him but also remember that it's JUST a memory and do your best to move on. I hope I helped!!!|`|qq2kDBwjaa	Mia, my dear first do what will make u feel happy...if it was me i will go to see him!! i'm sure u had such beautiful time together.don't u think he deserves a nice visit makes him happy a bit :)
SSMwwTnIaa	idk|`|kB7UsIXdaa	well it could just be a phase for her, so just keep talking like nothing happened and she could just warm up to you again.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	i wouldn't move on just yet! let her make up her mind continue on being her friend and flirt with her a lot. also call her and talk to her and hang out more.|`|oLa3rxlmaa	she obviously wants to get to know you more...  don't rush this.  believe me friends first works...  me and my boyfriend were friends first and after a year we are still going strong :)  good luck!|`|tO8ey3o8aa	continue wat ur doing  flirt, hang out, and she'll fall for u|`|SfrV7uFyaa	When you are with her, be yourself. Be as sweet and nice as you can and show her how much you truly like her.  Hopefully she"ll see how much you care and hopefully she will feel the same about you.
N8r4gi0gaa	thats pretty hard to chose from them just pick the ones that you like want to get to know better or friends that never talked about you behind your back i meen you know pick a person that you can trust and thats knows you more or somone that knows you less but just pick somone that u think is a realy good friend.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	Dont tell them that your having a party say its cancelled and just tell the people that are invited and if they find out be like sorry my mom chose i didnt get a choice.|`|ktEw3lJTaa	okay, i would pick your 4 friends, then i would take the rest out somewhere! like to the shore or simply out to dinner! A genius right!|`|O0iInu0Naa	Easy bring four complete strangers, people you barely know. Maybe the old man from the meat counter, the school cleaner or the gas attendant. Then you will have a real adventure to tell your good friends about if you return.

You cant gain confidence in a short time,it will build up gradually.    You can gain confidence by doing what youre good at,and making friends from the same hobby.    I have friends who are bad at social situations.they get scared and embarrassed easily-but the advise i gave to them is just to laugh it off,once you do,it will make the situation much lighter.|`|aSuWdqkaaa	be funny, get some guy friends to hang out with you at slopes. it should be easier getting in a conversation with a girl when you're arround with your buds. if you're good looking then just act cool and funny.    btw im a girl. and that's what i think you guys should do.  i used to really quiet. i finally opened up and now all my friends think im halarious.    find the right friends|`|ZpHnCQy6aa	we could be friends.i am just like that.just get to know the people.if you are comfortable around few people just walk up with them to the person/people that you may fear

RzIiywZ6aa	This has happened to me before, and I suppose in your situation I was your Maddie.  The first thing that you should do is have a talk with her one on one, to see what's really bothering her, because chances are she doesnt really care if you can pull of skinny jeans better than her, or if teachers like you over her. Question: when your hanging out together in public, and a boy comes up to talk to you, do you stop paying attention to her and hang out with the boy, making her a 3rd wheel? if yes, then thats probably your biggest problem. As for the liking the same guy situation, first of all, remember that the guy is going to like whoever he wants, so its not your fault if he likes you instead of her. But you should talk to your friend about it and make sure that she would be ok with it if you started dating, because if she really is your best friend, then she should be more important than some guy|`|b9532c7fa197923180e586a568d84295aa	She is not a real friend, because real friends don't behave like that. You can talk with her not mentioning Daniela . just  tell her that you have noticed or felt how she feels about you and you don't like it because you have considered her as a real friend ,that you feel very happy when she achieves something, here you can mention anything different she has done, because you think friendship is sharing and not feeling jealous .|`|mdtkor2Paa	just ignore
lHDq5gEraa	Your the one who should be angry! You didn't do anything to her and shes calling you all these names? Thats not right at all.

I had friends like that too and the longer you stay with them, the more they see you as their little b**** and not as a person.    trust me there are far better people than your "best friend" to be friends with. People come and people go, even though it may seem like you'll never find a friend you will. The point is to be true to yourself and show them that you're above them. plus they're insulting your twin too, so don't let it happen.    just walk away, the more you ignore them the less they talk because they won't get the reaction that they want.    respect and love yourself first, everyone else comes second.    good luck =]|`|dXcm5971aa	No, she's probably not right to be angry. If she really is your best friend, you'll make up with her. Try to talk to her alone or just ignore her for a while. Sorry about your twin.|`|HpWyrJKGaa	Wow. They're lame excuses for friends.

There has to be a goal in people life and reason for living or the desire hits bottom. Start there. Some people think they have to have a reason outside themselves but in fact that is the main reason to live. We can not control others lives but we can do something about our own. Also prayer can help. When some people feel emotionally drained, they blame God for everything and get angry. Try adding some laughter and not concentrating on negative stuff. Life gets hard sometimes to understand but there is an answer for everything. Our job is the find it.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	You don't.  They hold all the answers within.
0A5ErVxTaa	One day when your walking home, try drifting back and just start talking to him. Say something like, "hey, you look lonely." Then start up a conversation about school, or the walk home. You could also start with, "hey, i see you walking everyday and so i just thought I'd say hi, I'm____" Don't come at him like- hey i like you, and don't even know your name. Approach it more as, hey we walk the same way everyday let's talk and be friends. it may not work, some guys will just be like "no, not lonely" and close up. Hopefully though, you'll make a new friend, or maybe something more.|`|PmNGnHU8aa	talk to him be like o hey. how was your day? did you hear about -insert something funny that happened here-?

He want's to be nice about breaking up with you, and not to be mean but you're the 2nd choice, he probably has someone else in mind right now. I'd forget about him and get someone who is worth your time. If you're good to this guy here, hell realise it and beg for you back, do not keep in contact with him if you want to make him jealous the biggest thing you can do is forget about him. Nothing makes someone feel more jealous then knowing that someone has forgoten about them completely.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	He's breaking up for now, probably going to have some fun, then come back (maybe) realizing your the only one for him.|`|AA10531094	It means he doesn't want a relationship but doesn't want to hurt your feelings.

It can mean he just needs some alone time for him.    It can mean he wants to break up, but doesnt just want to come out and say it.    It can mean he wants to mess around with other girls.    My now fiance said he just needed some space to me after about a year of dating, and it turned out he was just missing his family.|`|63dfa23495d551ce972f5a3cdf68b3c8aa	When a guy says, he needs "time off".. it is never a good thing.. it usually means he just doesnt care for u the same way and wants to think things through before he continues with the relationship.., Hon u should be prepared for a break up, cuz that is wat he is tryin to say, he wants to break up, but wants time to think it through..     hon im sure u already figured this out and u just wanted some reassurance to help u believe that this isnt true, but it is... Im sry hon, but get used to the idea of life without him.. I could be wrong.. and i hope i am.    Good luck.

08308f32a27830f80dbbd663e5a16067aa	It is quite simple. Caucasians men really do like you but there are scared of if   a) their parents will accept you   b) their friends will tease them   c) their neighbours will point fingers and tag them     so they often stay safe within their comfort zone. however the more travelled they are, the more comfortable and confident they feel dating other races...    the fantasize about Asian and Blacks all the time .....but most of their societies are closed clubs and they being kicked out for dating other races !|`|AA12356146	well dear! there is a big difference in the behaviour and thinking of these two types.

I mean, the black guys would always make the move on me but the white guys don't. I know they're interested but they just don't come on over.

But I've always been told to stay away from asian women. Asian women and Jewish women, we're taught they're gold diggers and very controlling, Maybe I'm wrong on their nature, it's just one of those things that's planted in you.|`|AA12321795	black men know what they want, if you know what i mean, and they arnt backwards at making sure they get it.|`|61b3b03c61720f43438d51c0a3daaa00aa	Men in general are pretty dense and for whatever reason won't approach women.    Black men seem to have different beliefs than white men.  They seem to have the courage to approach women.    Enjoy the fact that men think you are worth approaching.  Don't question it|`|e11596d5231f5d12bf36613947950511aa	Black guys like to go after what they want/desire...and it can be in the worse way. Like they my just wanna crush you and be out. But then there are those who wanna actually get with you. As far as Caucasians go, Maybe dating asians is a bit taboo (?). They could be timid... or maybe you really do have nice eyes and a body and they can't help but look. It can be a number of things.|`|AA11335319	I cna understand why this would arise a question in your mind. As an african american female, I can tell you that it is socially accepted within the black community for our men to be outgoing and confident when they approach a female they are attracted to. Confidence is seen as a strength and proving your "man" enough for the challenge. You also have to take into consideration how you appear to men of different ethnicities. Are you slender, thick, skinny or even athletic. I would just guess and say that you might be very curvaceous and might even have a little "junk in the trunk" if this is the case then it migt help to know that the majority of black men (not all) are attracted to healthy women with very womanly attributes. I can't speak for all white men, but the white guys I know tend to go for the women who are size 10 and under. Believe it or not it has very little to with beauty but with how we are raised and our environment. Besides your body type, also think about how you carry yourself, how you were raised, who you hang with and even what you wear. There are a plethora of differences between ethnicities that are sometimes naked to a different eye.

I am SO RETARDED! Sorry, I'm just so retarded, that is so retarded!" and I said it like three times and then we went into the theater and I realized that the guy who gave us the tickets was retarded and that I'd just yelled retarded like 3 times in front of him!!!!     Not to mention that it's funny that a retard corrected my own retarded mistake.

AA11591306	If she is your girlfriend then you guys must share , share anything and everything, tell her you rdeepest felings for her, sow her in little things you do , playing with her hair, giving her little massages, leaving love notes in her bag to find, calling her at random times, (not stalker like) to tell her your thinking of her. That way she'll know your mad about her.

90b02d13d0e2cca02532b5742f02085aaa	Girl, fear isn't boring.  People get scared before asking someone. You gotta love that feeling, because that's the feeling you get wheh things are getting good.  Just say "Do you want to go out?" There isn't a right way to do it, so just do it.  And no matter what happens, if she says yes, if she says no, just feel a little proud that you did it.|`|6365b15fb61aab6c0d37bbb46c0afa9daa	if you were old enough,you would just ask her,i know my daughter wouldnt be going out at 14.you cant even have a drivers license.maybe you could just try talking to her first then see what happens.|`|1250156a979d5ef15e87fe7c54ec3a1caa	Just say it.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mmmmm.......      Nunca habia escuchado esa metafora, pero es bastante interesante. Creo que se refiere a que la chispa de un inicio se va perdiendo con el paso del tiempo, pero eso se da por que ambos pierden ese interes y esa emocion por estar cerca y por sentir "segura" a su pareja.     si esto te inquieta te puedo recomendar que en primer lugar saques de tu cabeza esa metafora, de lo contrario estas condenado a realizarla, y despues que te apliques a que no suceda, ?como? Simple: no lleves una rutina con tu pareja, nunca des por sentado el hecho de que porque ya estas casado ya no puede tu pareja buscar a nada ni nadie ms, eso es mentira; de ustedes depende que la rutina no se convierta en una mala costumbre, dale siempre un cambio a tu vida sexual con sorpresas, preguntale sus fantasias y trata de cumplirlas para que despues seas tu quien le platique tus fantasias y se cumplan y asi sucesivamente y creeme que logrars romper esa metafora.    Bueno... eso digo yo!    Saludos y exito.!|`|e95cbe90711e1c25beefdc56b3cfd10faa	Estadsticamente es as, ello no implica que el amor est dejando de existir.- Es simplemente que la qumica de la pasin est siendo reemplazada por la convivencia, por el compa?erismo, por el entenderse y comprenderse.- El aprender a "tirar parejo" como ocurre con los dos caballos que tiran del mismo carro, que en definitiva eso es el matrimonio.-|`|1e22b2e18c05c149c728070b015f987daa	Eso no es cierto llevo 22 anos de casada y nuestra llama continua prendida , es mas ahora lo disfrutamos mucho mas que antes .|`|2vQkcjjdaa	Al igual que Martha, yo tengo casi 22 a?os de casado y ahora es de mucho mejor calidad y la cantidad ha variado muy poco.|`|01vFxLNjaa	en el segundo a?o si    http://listadelistos.blogspot.com|`|ac14902eadc964655edd6e5ac5263922aa	Siiiiiiii seguro!!!! o las tendras todas!!!jaja|`|babff67c7eb8e3d878d5feef2c8af8f7aa	mmmm no se jaja tal ves y si|`|eW9BrW3uaa	porsupuesto,  y mas si yevas esa misma metafora en tu cavecita.  jejeje|`|HYgOM5Faaa	Seguramente, aunque en algunas parejas quiz falten monedas en el 2o a?o, pienso que no depende de que sea el 1o o el 2o, sino de la situacin por la q se est pasando o el estado de nimo, stres, etc...  no tiene nada que ver si los dos se quieren para siempre e incondicionalmente...  ooooooooohhhhhhhh|`|TLFzIbhfaa	si, la frecuencia baja un poco. pero se hacen mas sabrosas las relaciones!!!|`|49XzD7VLaa	la verdad quien sabe si sera sierto, pero lo boy a intentar el dia que me case.

695cbbcba51ceed2403cffaf9486d103aa	OK, let's see if I have got this straight. In your early teens, Michael wanted to develop your friendship. Your response was to abuse him and, with Chris's help, torment him with a display of affection for Chris. Over the years, Chris has not turned out to be the person you want to be with. Michael, however, has re-appeared and seems to be supportive of you. So, what should you do?    First of all, look at your own feelings and make sure that you would not use Michael just to get your own back on Chris. Secondly, if you want to spend some time with Michael (and that's the only way you are going to answer your questions about him), you should apologise for the way you treated him and ask how he would feel about your going out together. If he agrees, use your time with him to catch up on what has been happening to you both. Just relax and let the relationship develop in its own way. Be honest with him and with yourself.    I wish you happiness.
pM7NOYQ2aa	I think you should talk to him and basically start over on your relationship. Ask him to catch a movie or something simple and possibly from there, you'll know what to do. :)

How would u like to sleep in where she's sleeping now. U shld treat her like u treat urself. If u treat her s hi t, u will expect s h i t from her , or from ur Friends or ur family.

Las mujeres pedimos igualdad de derechos? no, lo que pedimos es que si hay una desigualdad, que esta est fundamentada por razones jurdicamente objetivas, y no por un argumento primitivo que no tiene justificacin ninguna ni objetiva ni nada, slo encuentran justificacin en coletillas medievales que dan la risa (como por ejemplo: "la mujer tiene el cuerpo preparao para parir y barrer porque lo digo yo que soy to y s ms", en la primera guerra mundial las que trabajaban en las fbricas eran las mujeres, y los hombres estaban en la guerra metidos en trincheras y mascando tabaco, como si as se arreglara el mundo, en fin).    Yo creo que el hecho de llamarnos histricas no nos convierte en eso, pero decirlo, s os convierte a los que lo decs en gente que evidencia un resentimiento subyacente hacia el gnero femenino... ser una rabieta de esas que se forman cuando te rechazan todas?... no lo s, slo es una pregunta...|`|32ec824d786874197ac4909197516e16aa	Hola Kefren:    Me gustara expresarte mis opiniones a lo que t externas, desde mi punto de vista como mujer que soy, adems madura -por la edad-:    -Las mujeres no "pedimos", exigimos EQUIDAD.  -No veo relacin alguna entre temas-sexuales-fuertes, con la equidad.  -El que seas machista, no significa que carezcas de sentido comn, respecto a la equidad, lo menciono porque aseguras que una mujer no es "mensa".  -"Detrs de un gran hombre, siempre hay una gran mujer", yo lo dira de otro modo: JUNTO a un gran hombre, siempre habr una gran mujer. ?No es acaso que un gran hombre desea a una gran mujer como compa?era?  -Estoy de acuerdo contigo, de que nos necesitamos, pero ?no crees que sera mejor NO NECESITAR, para no depender de otro (a), y ser un poquito independientes?  -El hablar con tu compa?era o pareja -como le quieras llamar- de sexo debe ser lo ms natural del mundo, pero considera que algunas mujeres fueron educadas as, con la idea de que el sexo es "pecaminoso", al igual que muchos hombres tambin, yo no creo que sea cuestin de gnero el que piensen de esa manera.  -El usar minifalda no es dejar de darse a respetar, de eso estoy segura. Es cuestin de gustos de cada una. El respeto no nace de la forma de vestir, sino de las maneras de pensar, y sobre todo de que haya coherencia entre el pensar y el actuar.    Deseo sinceramente que encuentres en tu vida a muchas grandes mujeres que t mereces, y que te hagan crecer espiritualmente al igual que t a ellas. Y digo "muchas", porque la vida siempre nos da la oportunidad de convivir con varias personas que merecen que las amen, y tambin t mereces que te amen.

jDu6KXEZaa	Follow your heart. I understand you don't want to disappoint your family members although they will learn to accept it over time. If you truly love this person thats all that should matter. It shouldn't matter what others say or think about the relationship because at the end of the day its what you think that counts. As long as you two have each other nothing else matters. Do the right thing, and live in the moment. You only live once, and your lucky enough to find someone who love that loves you back which is very rare now a days. Follow your heart and I promise you that you'll make the right decision.     Best of luck!|`|RUCTIaBbaa	Follow your heart if you love that certain person you move towards creating a relationhip.
RzIiywZ6aa	This is happening to me as well.   I think you should just take a break from your friends, maybe spend a little bit more time by yourself.  Personally for me, I get tired of my friends when we get in a rut, and we do the exact same thing everytime we hang out. Then it turns into not having anything new to talk about, and eventually it turns into having to hang out with them instead of wanting to.  So i would suggest doing an activity you don't normally do together. Since I don't know how old you are or where you live, I can't really suggest any, but me and my friends will go to downtown chicago, or go iceskating to get out of the regular habit of watching movies at someones house.|`|IvIHA5K6aa	Maybe your just bored  take you and your friends to do something new and exciting|`|wYTDwWnEaa	I always have this problem..

kB7UsIXdaa	just ask her who she likes, but do it casually like your making conversation. she would get the message that you wanted to hold her hand by just brushing her hand or just taking it, don't be shy. girls like it when guys make the first move. and to find out if shes interested, either straight out ask her or just talk to her friends. but don't make it awkward.|`|HnTpvVEEaa	just gently grab her hand. if she says something just say oh im sorry! i really think this girl likes u.. me being a girl would never go to the movies with a guy unless i was interested. and jus go wit the flow and ask "would u be my gf?" jus ask when the moment is right. if u never ask youll never know the answer! goodluck!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Definitely brush your hand against hers. See where she takes it from there.|`|yQgUcJ1Taa	Be way more direct.  Either she likes you or she doesn't.  You don't have to ask her permission in order to like her.  Just TELL her you think she's pretty or something.  If you want to hold her hand then grab it on your own.  If she stops you than act like you didn't think it was that big a deal.      Point is, BE CONFIDENT.    If this doesn't work, than she never liked you and there is nothing you can have done about it.  Pussyfooting around will do nothing for you, but either confuse her or make you seem like you have no balls.|`|cmFU81rQaa	don't ask her.  you don't need the going out label.  it doesn't matter.  just move forward, making the moves gradually.  Eventually you'll just sort of fall in to a relationship.
d8effBuPaa	Young love.  This is great.  I would hold her hand.  If she takes it away, you know your answer.  It sound like her touching your arm, she is trying to make the move.    Just start to hold her hand and ask her if she wants to be more than friends.     Marge85|`|O0iInu0Naa	there is an old saying "a faint heart never f*^*ed a pig", be brave go the the movies again and use the old popcorn in your lap trick, that will show her your intentions.|`|8jAVByHQaa	Flirt lightly and tell her how pretty she looks, when she seems to be getting the message brush the palm of her hand and ask about what she would think about being your gf!
OhJMuSR5aa	You should tell her you had a dream about you two going out, if it's a good response, she wants to date you. (=
8jAVByHQaa	First try to work out thing with your Bf, try to explain how messy and irrisponsivle he is without being rude, If he dosent comply to your request be nice and tell him that you dont think it will work out if he is like this. Then talk to the guy on the comp. say that your single and if he wants to date then he needs to be way better then your last relationship  Hope my advice works:)|`|9j6cMDobaa	the same situation happened with my sister she ended up breaking up with her boyfriend and ended up with the guy she really liked  then they ended up getting married and having a kid so in the long run it worked out for her this might be a suggestion for you

Bueno... eso digo yo!    Saludos
fL8CIA2Xaa	You need to sit with you dad and explain to him what is morally right, the right thing is your DAD should tell your Mum. She deserves to know and your dad owes her at the least  to be honest to her "now", and maybe start all over again.|`|kovBZS8saa	so sorry to hear that story,you shouldnt have to be the one to carry this burden of knowing what your dad did or maybe still does to your mum.  its very wrong of your dad to make you keep this secret,he should have had the guts to tell your mum himself. (obviously he shouldnt have had the affair in first place).  i dont really know what to advise you but what i do know is that by just reading your story it is clear that you are a well mannered boy,if you think your dad is still having a affair and you do tell your mum just try and stay strong for her. remember its not you thats done anything wrong,its not your mum either but its you two that are going to get hurt,its so unfair.  sorry i couldnt be more help,i jus read your question and thought id try and write something. I really hope everything works out for the best one way or the other.|`|ygimTNzoaa	If you're parents are not happy they should not be together, and hopefully you could understand that. It is not right for your father to cheat on your mother and she has no one else. If it were me I'd tell my dad you need to tell mom or I will, and it's your mothers desicion from there wether she wants to work things out. IF your dad is sleeping the night at this woman's house 1 night out of the week, things are that bad, I would feel so bad for my mom, and think if you were your mom. Seriosly I'd want to know, so I can start another life. You're dad's not happy with her and thats OK, my mom and dad devorced when I was 12, I wan't upset, I knew I'd still see my dad and he loved me and the reason wasnt because of me. People change. Your dad may not want to hurt you, some parents and one of the things my mom told me was "its not because of you kids", which of corse she didnt have to tell me, I know, and in the end I want them both to be happy. Maybe if your dad likes this new girl so much, he can marry her eventually, and your mom will move on any marry another man. People change. My mom and dad are both re-married and very happy, and that makes me happy. I hope you dont keep your mom in the dark, that's very sad. And good luck, it may be rough at first, but it will be ok in the end.|`|nyylb6qUaa	If you want to protect your mom, you need to tell your dad if it happens once more, you are telling her. Telling her will let her know that the happy life she might want is not with your dad. Plus, it will let your mom know how trustworthy you are. If you need help, my e-mail is themark08@yahoo.com. May God bless you.|`|eBwICYUMaa	talk to your dad and ask him if he was just lying to you before and make him tell your mom, she needs to know, and i know you don't want them to break up but it is probably for the best because you don't need to have shady and decieving people in your life|`|M3CsxF2jaa	You should pray about it and tell your mom.  if you want it cant get any worse than this.. your dad is using you a s pawn so you show put it out in the open. he should not have you in the middle. he will get mad but he will always love you. trust me i went through the same thing|`|ldLxcKW8aa	wow. I know this is going to be hard... but you have to try to be in your dads position. I'm sorry if this is hard for you.|`|LWVWvvmJaa	dude i'd tell her and let her know how things are. i mean going all those years with out knowing ? would you like some one to hid something like that behind your back?|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	I'm so sorry about your dad.  Hang in there.  Talk to your dad and make sure he ended it.  I know this seems impossible, but if he doesn't, the tell your mother.  she deserves to know don't you think?  yes, they might split up, but that isn't too bad.  trust me i know.  give it time.  good luck hun!|`|znxbqEv1aa	i think you should tell your mom that you dad was cheating on her...  she has a right to know!  i know it might be hard if the split up, but really its not up to you to make that decision.|`|ucbrBXK2aa	well there not much you can do, i mean you could  tell them adn  have them  go to  marriage consuling but it is their choice not yours....  i mean you cant make your dad love your mom i bet he does but if he is still doing this affiar thing you need to talk to him agian or  to your mom or anyone who could help,  just relax it not your probelm rember that...  i dont know if i help at all   hope i did :]|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	If you can live with the fact that you really had something to do with your parents getting divorced than say something to your mom. Otherwise just stay out of it.|`|AZB4BV64aa	You have to make your dad realize how this is hurting your family and how your mum thinks.  Send a note to him on Thursday saying  "Dad, can you come home tonight? Please? I'm really worried... and mum's worry is freaking me out. Please come home."  If he doesn't come home you have to send a second note saying  "You know what, leave it. I thought you loved me and mum enough to at least come home for one night and one night only to make us happy but I guess I was mistaken. Thanks for nothing."  Meaning these words or not he will get really worried and realize that the whole affair is ruining your family's relationship.  Good luck.|`|Npze2s0Uaa	wow im so sorry to hear that, I can definitely relate to your problems though as my mother and I have found out my father has been texting some woman recently. My parents have always had bad arguments as long as I can remember but they are still hanging in there. I hope for you your parents do to, and work something out.     As for you, well ignore the assholes who are putting pressure on you to tell your mum, let time be time and see what happens, follow what is right in your heart.    For now, I would leave it and see what happens between your parents.    Hang in there buddy, be strong and I hope it goes well.    Daveman|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	I'm sorry to say that at your age, there's not really that much you can do. You can definitely talk to your parents. Maybe talk to an adult you trust, who knows your parents, about this. Mainly, this is an issue that needs to be resolved by your parents.|`|oGlkH2wYaa	Speak to a family member you can confide in like your Grandmother.   See what they would say.|`|P0uh2Ckiaa	Wow - my first impression is that your dad is a horrible person for putting his own daughter right in the middle of his marital problems. It's not your job to be "in" on his little secret against your mother. How would YOU feel in your mother's place? Here she is, waiting for your dad to come home every night because she loves him and he's running around on her like a drunken college kid on spring break. He's being EXTREMELY irresponsible and disrespectful both to you and to your mother.    It's your choice whether to keep his secret for him or not, and i can understand you not wanting your parents to break up, but i also think you wouldn't be asking for advice if you didn't already KNOW there was something seriously wrong with the whole situation.    A counselor at school might have better advice for something like this, but if it was me I'd rat the b*stard out and concentrate on helping my mother cope with the news.|`|G9iLSkoeaa	im soo sorry about whats going on. the best thing to do (even though its going to be hard) to tell ur mom what ur dad did. its kind of wrong to know that ur dad is having an affair and ur mom doesnt know. i think you should tell ur mom because it'll hurt her more if she finds out later than everyone else. i know u dont want your parents splitting but i dont think ur mom should be living with this going on behind her back.   hope every thing works out. keep ur head up :)|`|ChmwmQfWaa	I think u should pray to God and ask him to help sort out the conflict going on between your parents and to also change your dad. Trust me, it would work. The Bible says in Matthew 7:7-8 "Ask and it shall be given unto u, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened unto u". If u call upon God in prayer, he's ready to answer u   God Bless  PS-I think u should let your mum know about this as well, because u cant handle it by urself|`|rCeEz6cDaa	I'm really sorry your in this situation. this might sound horrible, but you should tell your mom. She will be madly hurt if she turns out finding out and even more hurt that u knew and didn't tell her. It's obvious ur dad is probably still havin the affair with that woman, and hasnt stopped for you nor your mother. Dont let ur mother be treated like this.. she should know. i would die if i had to do this, but it's the right thing to do. It looks like she'll find out soon enough anyway.. imagine if ur dad wants to marry this other woman and asks for a divorce? i'm not trying to scare u and once again i'm sorry. Sit her down and tell her.. if u love her she deserves atleast that..  Good Luck!!!|`|Wa44n8RCaa	wow cool picyure anyway.  this is a position no one wants to be in but need help when in it.  i hav enever had this situation touch wood but if your parents are fighting then you may have to be prepared for the worst i.e a split.  Or although it is not ur responsibilty u could try and make them see why they married each other... discretly... let them go out for a meal or even a holiday... they may rip each others throats or they may see eye to eye so it's worth a shot but if it does fail do not hold your self responsible. Think of it this way... ur rents shouting is upsetting u not 2 mention the affair. Although the thought of  break up would be bad would it be as bad as this mess? if no this is worse then talk to ur dad tell him egsactly how u feel i.e u dnt like him lyeing 2 u and the affair (well im sure u made it pretty clear but ) and the shouting and if he does not stop then threaten him to tell ur mum and the affairee if they don't already know. A break up can have it's advantages... no rents screaming, you get 2 houses and they ussualy compete to get you the best presants ok so it's mostly materialistic but hey.  If someone cheats it IS coz there is a problem in the relationship or with them i.e ur dad. in this case it is both he can't commit and u mentioned a rough patch and if he has done it once he is more likely to do it again. i no its tough but you a relationship should not recover from this as trust will be lost. What i'm saying is ur mum shouldn'y let him back into her life. hope this helps my fingers hurt|`|HRSHjx49aa	If you have bin wating, you are going to have to wate a little longer. If you think that in the corse of a week or 5 days, that the relationship is getting stronger then it think that you should make your dad tell your mum. I dont think that they will split IF you get involved. I'm really sorry i couldn't be more help. I hope I helped. :)|`|dcJome8raa	This is probably what you don't want to hear..  If your father remains having affairs, tell your mother, she deserves to be with a person that wants and appreciates her. Even if your father does stop having affairs, he should tell your mother about the event as soon as possible. A relationship should only contain truth, lies build a bad foundation.   If they do get a divorce, you'll still see your father/mother! It's not like it's the end of the world plus, both of your parents will be happier.    This is the best I can do, I hope everything comes out alright!
qDpFSqn4aa	Um, I've done a lot more than just make out in the back seat.  I've made love in the back seat and front seat and gotten a BJ while driving.  In fact, I can't think of anything I haven't done in a car.  I started it all when I was 18.  I was a detective at the time.  Now I don't need to be confined in a car to have a life.  At home in bed is so much more fun and easy especially when it's a water bed and on these cold winter nights it's even better.  I'm 51 and too old to be in a cramped car for such things.|`|y3xu4wxUaa	yeah i have done it. i liked it until we got caught. i am not telling you my age:)!|`|K32Kpbjeaa	Yeah i've done that. lol I'm 14.    =P  yeah i liked it, it was fun. =]|`|DK6kYxmGaa	I'm 22 years old, and have never done that.

Es el nico trabajo que se nota cuando no se hace:  "el piso de la cocina est sucio"  "la cama est sin hacer"  " te olvidaste de comprar huevos"  Es tedioso y rutinario.  No es mi caso, puesto que con mi marido no tengo problemas, puesto que es el primero que reconoce la tarea femenina y sus pormenores, por suerte! pero veo a mi alrededor: en general el trabajo de la mujer est subestimado de una manera arcaica y obsoleta.

So slow down on guys.|`|5JTvWUwlaa	You are 13. That means the boys around you are immature.    They don't know girls from shinola. (That means they don't know girls)    I know you may not want to hear this...    Take your time. Let your friends make all the mistakes. Watch them get all the broken hearts. Boys your age are not ready for real relationships. They are only looking for one thing and will say anything to get it.    Just like wine and cheese get better with age, so will your chances of finding a nice guy.    Worst thing you can do is walk around feeling all sorry for yourself that guys aren't paying attention to you. You are smarter than that.    So, go do the things you like to do. Go have fun without worrying. Boys your age are more trouble than they are worth.    And then you never know, maybe some nice boy will see how independant and choosy you are and ask you out.    And you know those girls at 13 that looked really cute? At 20 they look worn. And the girls who were plain Janes at 13 looked incredible at 20. Which would you rather be?    Respect yourself. Give it time. I bet your going to be a knockout when you get older.    And no, Redheads are sexy. So I don't think your hair or complexion is keeping them away.

Probably having sex with her so soon after she was raped didn't help.  she will have to have counseling for awhile before she can feel comfortable with intimacy again.  It is good that you are there to support her.  A lot of women don't have this.  She may never get over the initial crime that has been done to her.  but with the help of support from you, family and counseling she will get better.  I have a lot of respect for you doing what you are doing for her...keep it up she needs that.

When a woman is raped, molested, or touched in any innapropriate way, it is the most ugliest feeling in the world. maybe when you guys had sex, it brought back images to her of what she went through. being raped is traumatizing. its hard for her, just hang in there and be as understanding as you can, remember us woman are very sensitive.|`|284694ea67891965ee5ec945661f1260aa	I have a friend that got raped and she got over it in 1 year. Her boyfriend helped her by spending more time with her and hugging her in bed and for about 2 weeks having sex but without sexual intercourse, It help es because the woman feels more secure and safe. Then not having very fast and aggressive sex but maybe  turning on some music having some champagne and then gust do it nice and slow so the she doesn't feel scared and doesn't think of the time that she got raped, and especially be gentle during sexual intercourse because during that period of time she can remember the pain that she had when she got raped. Talk to her when you are having sex and let her feel that you love her.Hope she gets better.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Por naturaleza los seres humanos no buscamos relaciones largas, sino unicamente de procreacion, entonces no es nada fuera de este mundo que se tenga sexo causal como si fueramos unicamente "animalitos" en busca de preservar la especie.     La sociedad es la que nos ha dictado las "reglas de buena conducta" que nos dicen que hacer y que no hacer, por ello la sociedad ve con "malos ojos" el que tengamos unicamente relaciones sexuales solo por tenerlas. Lo que si te puedo decir es que no debemos ser irresponsables en este sentido. Si lo que queremos hacer es tener sexo solo por el placer de tenerlo es necesario que seamos responsables y nos protejamos de cualquier enfermedad de transmision sexual y tambien de prevenir embarazos no deseados....

Two people can be who they are and not pretend. Can keep the secrets.  Will be there not just in the good times but the bad ones also.  True friends are very hard to have.  People want to be judgmental and not be honest when given a question to answer that may hurt the other so they side step the answer and make it sound good.

Es que fue tan impresionante, que lo recuerdo siempre. Mi hermano estaba surfeando con unos amigos, yo, caminando por la playa con mi perra, cerca de donde estaban ellos. De repente todos empezaron a gritar, y dos de los chicos salieron del agua, les pregunte que pasaba y me dijeron, nos encontramos una tabla de surf, flotando, y el primero que la agarre se la queda. Ahi se volvieron a meter, nadando en la direccion de la tabla, mi hermano fue desde donde estaba, junto con su amigo "cristhiano" (creo que era l). Bueno, cuestion que fueron ellos los primeros en llegar hasta la tabla. La agarraron y la Traian hacia la costa entre los dos, eso era lo que nadie entendia.... por que la traian los dos y por que pesaba tanto.... era una chica. Mi hermano y su amigo la llevaron hasta la arena... y miren uds una cosa: todos surfistas y nadie sabia primeros auxilios. Para mi hermano eso fue demasiado y se fue, estaba muy shockeado, fue en busca de algun auto para llevarla al hospital. La playa en donde estabamos dista unos 2 km ded la linea de casas, calles, etc.  Bueno, mas alla de nosotros, habia un grupo de chicos escuchando musica en un carro y tomando, uno de ellos vino hacia nosotros, y, al ver que era una de las chicas de su grupo, se desesper y comenzo a decir : no, no, noooo !!!!!! y al mismo tiempo le golpeaba, creo que la barriga, sto hizo que la chica se levantara casi 45 grados y expulsara espuma blanca y agua por la boca y nariz,: le habia salvado la vida.  Mi hermano se habia ido por ayuda y no sabia de esto. Despues de que llego el carro y la llevaron al hospital, el conductor, cuando le preguntabamos si sabia de como le habia ido a la chica, decia que no sabia nada. Meses despues, mi hermano estaba en un bar con su amigo, y se les acerca una chica y les pregunta: te acordas de mi???, mi hermano no tenia ni idea de quien era, y le dijo: no. Ella le dijo, vos me sacaste del mar aquel dia..... A mi hermano se le llenaron los ojos de lagrimas....  Es que todos decian: no se nada sobre la chica, y nosotros pensabamos que no habria resistido y habia muerto, pero no. Felizmente no.!!|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	No, todo bien pero gracias por preguntar.

mYAbq6fnaa	well, in this situation you just have to play it by ear. your friend shouldnt have sent out that text in the first place, because lying does not help anyone. she will wind up finding out sometime or another. but in this situation, i would start with the truth. just tell her that you had planned the sleepover, and only didnt invite her because you thought that she was going to the bar mitzvah. then just tell her that cathryn's mom didnt want more girls sleeping over than there already was, but suggest instead that you go out to dinner or see a movie to make it funner, until she has to go home. then suggest that you all have a sleepover next weekend or something.
2rwAu3Yraa	I.. Don't really understand what you are trying to say, but this is the answer to what i think you are saying. He's being a guy. I think he is interested in you but does not really want it to get serious yet and i think that is why he "could not find a pen" when you gave him your number. I hope you get what i'm saying because i don't really know how to explain this..|`|WpDISIzRaa	ask him but not directly if you are shy. also... don't seem to be so curious because you will look desperate. i he really cares, then of course he didn't forget about your number.|`|My83BMB5aa	ask him
ST7WcWfsaa	I would say the best way to go about confirming this, is by simply contacting her brother/sisters/parents and/or closest friends. This may be done secretly, in order to avoid embarrassing your friend.     Just a word of request. If you find out that your friend was actually lying all along, you may want to talk to her in a friendly manner, and request her to avoid the practice of lying, as it may become a continual habit in the long run. Ask her loved ones to do the same as well.    Please & Thank you.|`|4noWBPlUaa	I bet she probably exagerates things.

f8822d00ffd9a02b698a5cf7420d4c92aa	the connection you feel is the vibe of a healthy relationship.  You both like each other, and respect each other as people, and aren't judging each other.

pW9KhTFvaa	Say you're sorry.  If you want to be friends then do.  If they told you that so you should feel sorry for them, don't.  You can be supportive and strong for them without getting too emotionally involved.|`|AA11447210	Tell them how you feel...offer your support (if you mean it)...say "I'm sorry, I hope you beat it" or whatever you feel is appropriate.

xNkmK0SHaa	First:  what exactly is 12 - 16.? That 's a significant gap at that point in life.  So, are you 12 or 16?    Next:  crushes are a psychological phenomenon often caused by inability to form and have real relationships with peers.    Additionally, crushes often have to do  with influx of new and unfamiliar hormones.  It would seem you don't have them yet.  Be grateful.  In a couple years you will be back here asking other questions about things that are painful to you.|`|iu4SOin3aa	How are you 12--16?    Maybe your hormones just havent kicked in yet. Wait a couple of years before you get worried.|`|MhW3pLhLaa	It means that you're not into anyone right now. . . What's it supposd to mean?|`|Tp4R14rlaa	it means ur 12-16 and u don't really get crushes on guys or girls. jk i dont know. i started liking guys in kindergarten. lol|`|cN7eh7Tbaa	it just means ur not interested right now! ur time will come, just later! hope i helped sweetie!|`|6rRZGKxoaa	it's perfectly normal.  you don't have to like anyone.  it just means that the person you're supposed to be with isn't in your life yet.|`|5fe1d29bd466e79a18a65a07d90f084faa	Don't worry about it. It comes at a different time for everyone. Some people don't even get crushes at all till they find their perfect soul mate. It's just a matter of the person you are. Right now you're just not interested in dating or no one appeals to you like that. You probably have lots of other things to do, and having a crush is just not the most important thing in the world for you. Relax, it's nothing unusual and it doesn't make you strange. If you fall in love it will be at a different time with someone very special to you. Currently you probably just don't see anyone that catches your attention like that. :-)|`|9CUaikUEaa	thats fine, it may take time for you to start getting interested in people. dont worry about it, some people are into people from a young age, some arent :)|`|u2lYbPT2aa	Sweet One!!  It only means that you haven't even come close to finding that special person for you, and when you do...you will know it forsure!!                       xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|nxk1MLa8aa	Means you aren't going to mess your life up. Give it some time, not everyone gets interested in the relationship, bf/gf thing early.|`|Bz3OcrhOaa	This could mean a few things. One being that you're a very independent person and don't feel you need someone to 'complete you' yet (as cheesy as that is). Another, you could just be surrounded by people that are uninteresting to you (if you believe in the 'soul mates'). Or you could be much more mature than your friends/schoolmates. I wouldn't worry about this. If by the age of 20-25 you still have this problem, as a psychiatrist or school counselor (if you're in college).|`|LJkPRqN0aa	its normal..... dont worry about it.. people are different and get different feelings at different ages....i didnt start dating or anything like that til i was 18 and i was completely fine with that.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	It's normal for you to not like anyone. Maybe you're looking for something specific in people and your not finding it in anyone right now. You'll feel it when you meet the right person. Your hormones might not be totally here yet. You shouldn't feel pressured to like or date someone just because everyone else is. You'll know when the time is right.|`|LeiF941naa	that your just not into that yet. it'll happen don't worry.|`|bLsWEpDFaa	you don't need to have a crush on someone constantly. it justs means that no one really interests you right now. don't worry. (;|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Your only a kid.. Maybe if you didn't worry about grown up things it will happen naturally when you grow up..
FqmXXiPsaa	Coming to my house!!! =D   I'm kidding,now talking seriously,you can find many Brazilians in Newark and Boston,there are hundreds of thousands there. =)|`|nRkq8RaQaa	That's nice to read.    Well, use the internet! It is pretty common among Brazilian people to meet other Brazilians on a social network named orkut ( http://www.orkut.com ). There is a group named "Brasileiros nos Estados Unidos" (Brazilians [living] in the United States) , here is the URL: http://www.orkut.com/Main Community.aspx...
583d346632622e7f9986fd4a551a039daa	Just talk to her a lot. Spend a lot of time with her and smile a lot. Touch her hair gently and say, "Are you okay, baby girl?"  But try not to say the things that makes her nervous. You will understand her better after time goes by, and she will feel more comfortable with you after a while. Just be kind and you will melt her fears away. After that, when she is more relaxed, wait until she wants to talk about these things before you bring them up. Love will see you through. If she speaks only english, then practice your English with her, but if you two speak the same language, then talk to her in her mother tongue. The sound of her native language might help to relax her.|`|AA11673580	She's probably nervous trying to figure out what you are saying|`|AA11610394	this isnt specific but you can listen to her feelings|`|17a9d37c6b79463f300045b080c4b081aa	1st you should learn english. then ask the question again. that made no sense.|`|bc0d7e9cbcda5069b3fb69acb08c7527aa	It's her life.

Just make sure that this criticism is necessary.  Don't tell her things she doesn't need to know, that are just straight out hurtful.......|`|86e883c6fd82fe1198e75c743090ee4baa	The nervous thing is her ordeal, not yours.   Just conversate alot as great friends and go places together.  She'll adjust and grow with your guidance, in an unsuspecting manner. Encourage her to get out with you like this.  Do'nt tell her that she's too nervous and you don't like that.|`|AA12372849	You can just tell her that you still love her and that you just need to tell her that something is not right.

RzIiywZ6aa	She's not really your friend.  My absolute best friend in the world is going out with this guy that I currently despise more than almost everything.  However, I would never tell her that I hate him, because he makes her happy and I don't think its right to take that away from her.  Your friend is probably just unhappy with herself and is jealous of the great relationship that you have going, so she is trying to ruin it.|`|Tbhmsrlsaa	I'm not doctor Phil or nothing but It seems to me shes not being a very good friend. If she cant accept that you like this guy and leave it alone, then she really shouldn't be your friend. Friends are meant to stick together. good luck to you|`|DYdXrVVeaa	shes jealous of you, you dont need her, shes not your real friend  sit down with your ex and tell him that shes trying to break you up, then cut her out of your life.

Now I know this is going to be hard but the best thing to do is cancel the wedding and get him out of your life, for good. When he calls ignore him, when he tries to come back like past times, just tell him straight up "No" you won't take him anymore. Stick to it, things get so much more complicated when you have kids. Be careful though some guys can become abusive when they get denied. You deserve so much better than this!|`|iu4SOin3aa	I broke it off with the first guy I was engaged to by throwing his stuff outside and changing the locks. If telling him you love someone else is what it takes, then just tell him you are so he'll leave.    Call the police if worse comes to worse. Tell him you'll get a restraining order against him if he wont leave you alone.    Just be strong. I know its hard.|`|67z7HHTJaa	hes crazy  get away from him  that doesnt sound healthy AT ALL|`|sD1SZXEmaa	well.... just break the engagement. Then you're free.|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship and you don't even sound interested. Tell him it's over. If he wants to see you, tell him you don't want to see him. Just try to stay away from him, until he finally gets it, so that you can avoid the verbal abuse.|`|kA1mYSOtaa	Hi, Kamilia. One of the things that you ladies do that I don't like is that you usually do not say how you really feel. Especially when it comes to breaking up, you prefer to wait until he does something stupid (which he has done before without repercussion) and you break up with him for it. If not, you try to be as impossible as you can in order to get him to dump you instead so that you don't have to do it yourself. I would say that you are either holding on for some reason, you feel deep down inside that these things are really NOT worth ending it, OR you are afraid to be the one to initiate this momentous change. If you don't do it now, you will only have to do it later anyway. I mean, what are you going to do, wait until your wedding day and just not show up? If you truly want out, do it now before it hurts both of you more than it needs to. You owe it to the man who loves you, and (most importantly) you owe yourself happiness. I wish you well.|`|OafbteCxaa	Thats not healthy  dont do anything to make him want to keep doing it  ignore him    you can even get a restraining order  but that may make matters worse|`|e1BkGiOYaa	what a psycho!  but ask yourself:  why is he so attached to you?  it might help.    and you should make him jealous  and bring a guy to the house  and leave your fiance out.  muhahaha >:D|`|dIcF9x76aa	hello, what ever your fiance is doing with u is not good, he should not be doing with u. before break up, i want u to really know why he is doing all thing to u, what's the reason behind it. let him know that u he really doesn't stooped doing these thing to u, u will certainly leave her, let him just give a warning. try to find out the reason behind all these weirdest things, and one most imp thing i wanna ask u-   "when he was normal, were not u in love with him and could u be happy after getting separated"?|`|Bdlmhhcsaa	who cares about "he will never leave me unless...." crap?!    its your call and NOT HIS    if he is really hurting your feelings then he isnt in love with you and once that love his lost for him, honey, you will NEVER get it back no matter how hard you try. what happen on the first few months of dating? perfection right? butterflies? and all that is gone b/c of the way he acts towards you. love is like a rose....just b/c it blooms doesnt mean you have to pick it off the stem! you have to continue to feed it and water it and care for it. ive seen too many people get into something, and after the "honeymoon" is over, it is all downhill from there.     leave his A** and find someone who will treat you like your the only lady in the world.
AA11806027	women that knows a goodman when they see one and doesn't play games,but today's women don't fit that,all you women want to do is play games and run after your so called badboys.
qDpFSqn4aa	If you think you were meant to be together then you were.  You don't need advise from people you don't know just go with your gut feelings.  When it comes to love your gut knows best.   It sounds like you might have a keeper on your hands.  I can't stand guys who think they have to be violent to be in a relationship.  They deserve to be single all their life.    If you like him then go for it.    Hope this helps, good luck.

Lj2mo4ooaa	That is kind of creepy.  It seems like he wanted to get with you and he was not shy about it.  You will run into guys like that in your life----we all do.  So, now you need to come up with a plan--------in the future, if something like this happens again, you know you should NOT tell your real name, so . . . make up a fake one now so that you won't get scared and accidentally give out your real name like you did at the pool.    You also did the right thing by going over to your friends.  If you had gone somewhere by yourself, the boy would probably have followed you.  So . . . you were smart to do that.    If you are afraid he might come after you (like at your house or something), then you should tell your parents (if you are young) or someone you trust.    As women, we get "feelings" about creepy guys.  You should always LISTEN to those feelings like you did at the pool.  Good job!!  ?  ?
KaRbzqiDaa	Well, if you haven't talked to him in a month, then chances are he might not anymore. But who knows. Take a chance, talk to him, ask yourself if he's worth the risk. ^^    Good luck.|`|J9C90TIbaa	ummmm....im not sure?.....Maybe he is just a nice guy...which means u should go for it cuz they r rare!!|`|TtVk8S4aaa	i think he do likes you|`|kAiPPmF5aa	i think he likes you but may think your too young
GLjZEuvFaa	There is a lot of things you guys can do. That is if anything is open. If you are planning to go somewhere right after then you should try bowling or the movies. You can also go paintballing, go carts, the mall, or something. Depending on where you live there is various activites.

lNlL0Ag2aa	Shaped thighs because that is actually what makes a butt look better rather then eating burgers just to fatten it.     A flat toned stomach is also the same thing, I prefer that more than anything because that is what also makes your boobs stick out. What most guys don't really realize is that a girl is curvy not by how big their protrusions are but by how slender they are which gives them that hourglass sexy appeal.|`|5tS24cb6aa	Big Butt here i love being able to have something to hold onto in public|`|tsdHndRhaa	big boobs and butts sag, so don't get to attached to outer beauty, it's all about loving who you are within.

Gross, yes, but normal.  Id suggest a change in diet.  Keep away from the beans!  There is a product, called "Beno"  Put some on your food, and it prevents gas.    Take into the shower and both of you wash each other.  Then perform for her!|`|xndqTCn6aa	Ewww give her some gas-x or something. Maybe some beano.

My husband does that all the time and it's getting to the point where it is getting on my nerves.

Once I told him about it he said he was going to try and see what his problem is because I believe he passes way to much gas, maybe a health problem.

It's a natural bodily function that everybody does.  You can let her know that it's a turn-off, and kindly ask her if she could excuse herself to the bathroom when she feels the urge.  How do you act when you pass gas?  Do you excuse yourself, or just let it rip?  Don't expect her to be courteous about it if you aren't.|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	Tell her how much it disgusts you and is so "low-class!"
yq6lYRiOaa	Stop trying to be what women want; and be yourself!!!|`|0HYG8PlNaa	You really should let her do the talking. Dumb it down? that sounds like some of the problem. You shouldn't have to "dumb" it down. Conversations when first meeting should be light anyways. Let her talk about herself, ask her about herself. Movies, does she like to read, family etc. You will be fine it is all a learning process anyways. Don't worry. Just don't come off as a man with all the answers.|`|qq159sWMaa	The whole dark sense of humour isn't a bad thing as long as it isn't exceeding dark right off the bat.   As for the whole chivalrous vs. distant and emotionally un available... find somewhere in the middle, when you become distant suddenly females tend to take that as a lack in interest and not evey one will beg for someone they're interested in to hangout with them.  Don't dumb it down either.      Be yourself that's the only way to make you both happy in the end.|`|C1KHeim1aa	The dark sense of humor might get a little....scary. But hey! That's why there's goths! haha just kidding ;)  Girls don't like players because they have more of a chance on cheating on them. Intimidation is also really good, some girls look for that. One of my friends only becomes interested in a guy if he's better than her in a way.   ex- we take karate and he was really good so it gave her a goal. she would try to beat him and when they were at the same level, they acknowledged one another and it was all good. do you see where i'm going with this?    also, that girl will come along one day.... you just have to do the things you like and you'll find her. cause you know, relationships are formed because people share things in common. why else would they hang out with them?|`|2tnFQYhEaa	I'm intrigued...

Por mi parte soy lo contrario a eso, no se por que pero siempre soy la de la iniciativa, pero de los 2 con que he tratado algo, lo que pasa es que despus me salen "kuku" (o sea gays =S).|`|AK0KAHCUaa	pues no se de que mujeres hablas, pero en mi caso, cuando me pasaba hace muchisimo tiempo si no me agradaban si era grosera para auyentarlos, y cuando me caian bien les explicaba que no mas no me interesaban de otra forma mas que como amigos, de la unica persona que me a gustado que me diga eso y otras cosas mas es mi novio, y creeme cuando el me lo dijo no fui ni distante ni engreida ni nada de eso. todo lo cantrario me volvi de trapo jejejeje :$ y solo me gusta que el me lo diga, yo no mas le respondo a mi hombre jijiji ;)|`|QJ0IMkioaa	si, obviamente se siente diferente, y no como mando,o pues algunas mujeres si, que les gusta tener a todos detras, yo mas bien diria que se siente especial que alguien te diga algo asi, o que te llame todas las noches, eso mata a culaquiera, pero que no saben que las mujeres, o por lo menos la gran mayoria somos muy sencibles..???|`|1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Estimado Alberto:       ?Te apoyo en tu inquietud!   Y si alguna mujer se atreve a contestarte le aplaudire de pie...!!!      Porque creo que muchas veces  ni ellas saben bien el porque de su forma de ser. Te doy un buen consejo:  A las damas no hay que entenderlas sino nada ms amarlas como son, si tratas de entenderlas te pasaras toda la vida tratando de hacerlo y no podras.    Mejor nada ms amalas como son.    Bueno... eso digo yo!|`|7bLRM0Tnaa	mira si te gusta dile q tu tambien sientes algo x el pero si no lo conoci bien dile VOI A PENSARLO  i listo pero ojo  no t tardes tanto en contestarle poq se puede aburrir|`|uyPPQf2Haa	Claro que no somos las mismas pero si cambiamos y nos alejamos es por timidez, o te alejas porque tu lo considerabas tan solo un buen amigo, por el contrario si te gusta tal vez es el inicio de una hermosa relacin.|`|sPGD8g48aa	Somos asi generalmente cuando nos gusta el chico, nos damos un poquito de importancia, asimismo uds no pensaran que somos tan faciles. Y si no me gustas te lo digo y ya, para que darles largas verdad..|`|z6cye5HXaa	sabes eso es lo normal te apuesto que hasta tu te comportarias asi sabes porque ?porque la mayoria tiene miedo a enamorase y exponer su corazon a sufrimientos asi que se piensa que uno solo debe recibir pero no dar  o al menos no amar con toda el alma y el corazon como posiblemente alguna vez  se amo pero fue mal correspondido .
0WUcM6NBaa	why spend money on calls that are never returned? If she won't call, why should you? If she ACTUALLY wanted to be with you again, she'd call, text or visit. She wants to be adored. She's a woman, don't call her and if she calls, explain why you won't call. you shouldn't need to go through all of this!|`|KifasiMraa	I wouldn't call her anymore.  The best case scenario is that she wants to be friends, but just doesn't have the time because of her bf and kids.  I won't even go in to the worst case scenarios.

IyOkwITHaa	While it's not exactly cheating (because you were broken up), it's still pretty wrong to toy with your emotions especially with you being pregnant! I believe that you are RIGHT ON with giving him that big decision to make because now of all times is the time for him to grow up (not end up getting ANOTHER girl pregnant in the long run). Valuable time is being wasted (9 months) and if he makes the wrong decision, he could ultimately miss out on valuable moments concerning with his child. So you ARE doing everything right, and if you ever need any advice feel free to contact me!|`|cDubFtwlaa	hes not cheating unless he was screwing around with her before u broke up|`|6kZl8a39aa	its fine for you to give him an ultimatum your just expressing how u feel and you have reason to be upset if he said he doesnt even have feelings for her then why did he kiss her but u should really think about it before u make a commitment and move in with him bcuz then in the end you might regret it if you do decide to move in with him then your going to learn to have to trust him good luck and i hope yall work things out for that baby.

lQGDV7MEaa	That would be pre-***, my dear lass.  Makes it easier for the actual wardogs to make it through enemy lines.  It can make a girl pregnant because some soldiers are too anxious to wait for the rest of the platoon.  It's best to withdraw before he sprays his bullets.|`|LykjWv6faa	It's pre ***.

Yes, it definitly and easily can. People think that if they pull it out right before they ***, the girl can't get pregnant but the pre-*** contains semen. Not as much as the actual *** but it does contain it.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Its a condition that is not good but a lot of guys have this problem.  Yes it can get you pregnant but its like a 1 on a few billion chance.

hcRGqk2gaa	If she's stuck on a relationship that you had before you met her......... then you need to let her go.     It may be hard, but seriously... that's non of her concern if you don't even like the ex girl anymore.    If I got stuck on the past relationships that my bf has had before he met me then I would be angry all day everyday.    And vice versa. If he knew and got stuck on my past relationships then he would be furious, especially considering I have a 3 year old daughter that's not his. He's known my daughter since she was 8 months old.     So... yea... you need to let her go.|`|AA12272885	She is insecure. So tell her you want nothing to do with this other girl, and ask her how you can end this once and for all.

Obviously you aren't doing enough to show your girlfriend that you want nothing to with that other girl. And you obviously aren't doing enough. I never get when guys tell me that a girl just won't leave them alone but they are answering the girl's calls and what not. Makes no sense to me.    Edit  Sorry I didn't understand what you were saying.   In that case she may not get past it.  You need to tell her that she either needs to trust you and ya'll need to break up.

She's probably doing it 'cause she's jealous, thats why most people act like definitive turds anyway ;)    The fact that she also put 'this isn't aimed at anyone' at the bottom just implies it was too..

Some people say that you need to give all your attention to you partner, this is true only if it means that you shall also make your self happy. Because if you forgot all about your happiness and sacrificed it to focus on your partner's both of you ll be unhappy. When you manage to make this balance where you both exchange happiness, life will be a better place for both of you. Make her feel confident in love, in her self in the world and seek pride in your being together.

HnXOEDbcaa	Tell her to knock off the crap because she knows what really happened. If she does anything more to you, you will have to tell your Mom or Dad, Guardian, or a counselor at school. I had troubles with a few friends like that and we had to go to the vice principal's office, we became true, real great friends after talking to the vice principal. What he did was show us we're the same, he told us to put our hands on his desk. He took out a pocket knife that a kid had taken to school and got expelled, and didn't get it back. He was putting the knife just about to our hands when we both pulled our hands away. He said that we both have red blood, what's the problem? And that what we were doing was stupid because we were fighting for nothing. We know better than to believe rumors. He was 100% right. Your 'friend' doesn't seem like a very good 'friend'. She doesn't seem like a friend at all. She turned her back against you, not a true friend. All i can say is if she continues after you tell her to stop, contact a counselor or your parents; guardian. Best of Luck! ?|`|bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	Don't waste time trying to track down who started or spread the rumor. It's futile and ineffective. Just front her and tell her that the rumors she had heard aren't true. If she doesn't believe you, her loss. Challenge the veracity. Big rumors are the hardest to deal with, as they are not easily stopped. To try to stop them, tell everyone they aren't true.

There could be deeper issues though, that she might be willing to share with you, if you can get her to talk. |`|ZYDFl4eDaa	how old are you/she.  has it always happened?|`|6C86oxBoaa	take it as a complement maybe she was crying because she never had sex that good before or maybe it hurt ask her. |`|q8T2fyPYaa	must be some bad sex.|`|4MwHVTpZaa	I think you should talk to her.   it may be nothing important or it could hide something else.    I was taken advantage of when I was 15 and it was my first time. The second time I did it, I told the guy what had happened and that I might cry or something but to not worry about it. At the end I did cry because it reminded what had had previously happened, but he was good about it.     If you care about her, talk to her.

To me he appears to be a guy who likes to take things slow, which is a good thing for the both of you. He also seems like he wants to get back in touch with you, just make sure that you do not go blaming yourself for everything and the reason why the 1st relationship failed because you will hear it forever.

If she did, then you've got better chances. Anyway, tell her how you honestly feel, how she gives you goosebumps when she smiles at you and you don't want the times you have together alone to finish. Be straight with her, nothing less. What I always tell myself, is this...(this is for your shyness). Count to 5 in your head. When you get to 5, you MUST come out with what you are going to say. Do it slowly or quickly but whatever happens when you get to 5, there is no going back. Stupid- I know, but it seems to always work for me.|`|H7cKPK56aa	Girls like guys with confidence.

Like it looks like I'm staring at a person, but really I'm like completely not thinking at all. So when I realize I'm kinda staring at someone and they notice, I look away just cause I was embarrassed and didn't mean to be staring at them.    OTHER times, when I'm staring at a guy and i get caught and i look away cause I'm embarrassed. Sometimes I'd smile and look for a second longer then look away.    In general, it's just cause they felt embarrassed or stupid to be staring.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	It could mean a lot of things, but mostly that he is checking you out.

tHw6GAsfaa	Since you met on the internet, he probably doens't want to hang out with you or meet you anywhere, because he can't be sure of who you really are.  He is doing this most likely because he believes that it is possible that you could be a murderer or kidnapper.  But you can't blame him, because there are many stories about people on the internet that pretend to be someone's friend and invite them to meet them somewhere.  And it usually ends up that the person is a crazy and kills the person when they meet in real life.  Also many times, they are a grown adult messing with a kid, trying to get ito their head.  Now, I am not trying to say either one of you is like that, but he probably is just trying to stay on the safe side without hurting your feelings.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	He probably doesn't like you.|`|67z7HHTJaa	move on...u can find someone better who pays more attention to u...and stop asking him to hang out all the time! let him ask u!

Showing interest in a guy makes him love you.|`|ZAgiWmhKaa	I think if the babe is chilled, hot, nice, sexy, maybe smart. It always helps to have a great personality. If you are funny, that sometimes catches a guy's eye as well. If you have friends that are really close to you, and you can tell that you guys are extremely close, it shows that you guys are loyal, and fun- loving at least toward each other.    IDK!!!    Hope that helps.
AA11503678	It is my belief that gossiping about a person is wrong thing, which can end friendships, because becoming a gossiper makes you unreliable. This damages all kinds of relations in society.     In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.    12.   O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: and spy not on each other, nor speak ill of each other behind their backs.

Just say to yourself you arent going to do that and dont do it.    its human to want to talk about somebody so you can look better. But i just say to myself. I treat people like i want them to treat me. Not to say i dont say anything negative about somebody. But i dont go around calling people names behind their back or too their face. And i try to convince my friends they dont need to do that either (which rarely works). The important things is not to feel like you have to add something when somebody is talking about somebody else. Simply, "i guess so" and "well thats none of my business, and i really dont want to talk about it".|`|fpyLWbVxaa	go to the source,  find out WHY you talk about people  are you jealous? does it make you feel better about yourself? are you insecure?|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Shut your mouth|`|Hkjy7kLhaa	i dont kno, but i need help with the same thing! tell me if you get a good answer?!?! thx!|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	just say or recognize good things about people first   stop gossiping isnt hard, it just requires a league about what u r doing and what u fail to realize about people|`|yOnPEbcIaa	Avoid it and compliment them instead.

He told you that he needed a break but didn't want the relationship to be over. What he really meant was he wanted seek out another relationship, keeping you on hold in case the new relationship went south, then he could come back to you. He may have been telling you that he loves you, but those were just words. He was able to convince you, a manipulative action,  that it was okay for him to see other girls, but wanted you to be in waiting for him, his life preserver if the new venture failed.    You received entirely a different outlook.    When you saw him with another girl, you took his actions as a departure, a breakup from your assumed still "on hold loving relationship" with him. You struggled with the thought of seeing him and the other girl together, and coped with your rejection from him, and moved on.     You are confusing love for attraction ... you are a freshman, he is a junior. I seem to recall having those attractions. You will learn in time, not now, that your expressed 'love' for these boys was only an attraction. Are you comfortable with the new boy that you are seeing. You didn't hookup with to spite your former boyfriend, did you? Ask yourself why you are attracted to the former boyfriend. Does he look hot? Does he appear to be popular with the other girls? Reason out what he told you and what you thought that he told you, then add to that how you saw him react. Your interpretation of 'him' taking a break from you and his real meaning of 'taking a break from you' should influence you decision about whether to break off your new relationship and go back to your previous relationship.    Your belief in 2nd chances is sincere, but not with this situation. If you leave the boy you are with and go back to your previous guy, two people will be hurt ... you and the boy that you left. The former boy looks at you as a conquest, especially since his B.S. didn't float with the other girl.    Peace and Love,  penguin44240

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Mi querida Simona, yo creo que si tu pareja no quiere un hijo contigo, sus razones debe de tener y creo que tu debes de saberlas, (sino preguntale y llega a un arreglo). Si no sabes las razones y no te las quiere dar, probablemente tiene miedo al compromiso tan fuerte que es tener un hijo.    Si en verdad quieres tener un hijo, lo mejor es que seas honesta con tu novio y termines con l, de lo contrario puedes tener muchos problemas futuros. Busca a alguien que realmente pueda apoyarte en este sentido, la naturaleza, instinto o como quieras llamarle, es muy fuerte, y tu deseo maternal no lo puedes dejar a un lado y mucho menos por una persona que no comparte tus deseos y anhelos, si no te puede ayudar, pues adios.

cJF0S72baa	Creo que todo depende de la idea que tengas del amor. Si crees que el amor es como en las peliculas y/o telenovelas, creo que asi no existe.  Ahora bien, los sentimientos hacia una persona pueden cambiar con el tiempo.   Yo puedo decirte que amo a mi esposo y que el amor que siento por el es verdadero porque asi lo siento, pero eso no desamerita el amor que en su momento sent por otras personas que tambien fue verdadero pero que desafortunadamente no continuo creciendo como tal.

Ahora que si te refieres a el amor entre dos perfectos desconocidos... tambien existe, pero por desgracia dura muy poco tiempo, segn estudios antropologicos dura aproximadamente 4 a?os, esto es debido a que es el periodo que los primates cuidan directamente a sus crios, despues de este tiempo los dejan a su suerte... y desgraciadamente nosotros tambien tenemos algo de primates.     Pero no te preocupes, si realmente encontraste el amor en alguien ms mi recomendacin es que cada tres a?os puedas hacer algo completamente diferente, por ejemplo tener un hijo, cambiar de auto, tomar unas vacaciones muy largas como si fueran otra luna de miel, cambiar de casa o incluso de ciudad, claro que todo en la manera de lo posible..

4WszPA0Paa	Well if u like to kiss with them open, then kiss with em open..    the thing is.. most senses are enhance when others are shut down... so if u cant see, ur brain isnt thinking of what ur looking at.. but what u can feel.    A lot of the time when ur eyes r open, the kiss may get awkward and//or not as good because ur thinking of other things and not focusing on the passion.... maybe not for u but for him, so compare with him sometime    haha, sometimes i like to sneek a peek cuz its cute to c a girl focused and close up yeah?|`|IN1X1CVGaa	theres no meaning  some people just like them opened or close  sometimes my bf glances at me  cause he says its cute  but theres no meaning to either|`|AA11425983	It's preference really.

En cuanto al dolor tu pareja es la que debe de cuidar esos detalles, ya que debes de tener un grado de exitacin adecuado para que tengas una lubricacin vaginal buena para que el dolor sea minimo, ahora no te preocupes demasiado, hay muchas mujeres que no sienten ningun dolor, puede ser que tu seas una de ellas.      En cuanto a que se siente, pues es una experiencia bastante buena cuando se sabe hacer, todo el proceso desde el primer beso hasta la culminacin o climax es bello cuando lo haces con amor y no solo con pasin. Esos 10 segundos de orgasmo son una experiencia nica e irrepetible, es una sensacin que muchas culturas la han llamado "divina", puedes cas tocar el cielo.      Eso si, cuando te animes hazlo con responsabilidad, siempre protegete desde la primera relacin, es mentira lo que se dice que cuando es tu primera vez no te puedes embarazar, claro que se puede, adems de que debes de cuidarte de cualquier enfermedad de transmisin sexual (ETS).

7a105cd425138717ca03d16078225748aa	You just have to know that he's somewhere happy and cry free. He's not thinking about you. Think of it that way...the mere thought of him being happy with someone else should motivate you to get your mind off him. I wouldn't say jump into another relationship or try to replace him because that's continuing the weakness he has instilled within you. However, simply making friends with various guys and talking to them is extreamly healthy and will help  you keep your options open and to learn the essence of diffrent types of men. This will ensure you don't go through the heart break syndrome again. So I would suggest getting your self a friend.    Also, try this: Get a journal or something and write down 10 things you loved about this guy that your so broken up over. Then write 10 things you didn't like about him along with five reason's why you should mourn over him. This will help you see your issues on paper and you will have a better glance. Whatever questions that are leftover and feelings that are still balled up on the inside express them through your journal. Getting things out can be very theraputic. Because the reason that it still bothers you after two years is because there was something left unfinished and you probably constantly ask your self "why?" and you may ask your self if it was you. Get all this out and this will help you cope and get over him.

You can never completely heal a broken heart, but you will eventually get to a point where you'll be okay. Cry. Crying is good, dont' be afraid to let it out because if you hold it in, you might fall apart even worse. Go out with your close girlfriends and cry with them. Keep yourself busy, but don't deny your feelings. Find things to do. I really find just being with other people makes me feel better. Talk to your girls about it, cry with them. In time, you'll be okay. Just hang in there. If you need me, you can message me. I'll be there for you.|`|AA12256807	I've been thru that and I'm going thru that now...I think yuh would haffi do ting 2 take yuh mind off of him like do fun things: go out with di gyals, go shopping, amusement park, etc.|`|9f4356cd4531b1bd1eb0557fa6c16a66aa	i no just how you feel my bf of 3 yrs broke up with me a week ago i was riped apart    but it made it easyer knowing he had cheated on me b 4 we broke up........ so i knew he did not care and it made it a bit easyer........    but the best thing is to get out of the house and have a good night out or shoping spree to get you back in to the swing of things HOOORRAAAYYYY|`|AA11613140	Replace him....duh|`|181ac9c8350c1bc8e40def6515d189acaa	och that is sad|`|85b878c370e81d0a22a8ad02a61cd067aa	Dear, there are other fish in the sea.

Honestly the absolute BEST thing for that (this may sound strange) is volunteer.  Go online and look at what in your community might need your help.  Go to the rest home and cheer up some elder people.  Or volunteer at a food drive once a week.

If you are 150% sure that you will never get back together, you need to get rid of anything and everything that is associated with him and the two of you as a couple.  Most importantly, GO OUT!  Whether it's for walks, or clubbing with your friends, do not stay home and mope, evertime you think about just staying home and being sad and depressed just think that he is out there living it up and not thinking twice about you so why should you be home thinking about him?  I'm sure you are a wonderful beautiful person and it's his loss so make sure you show him that by not sitting at home crying.  Be strong and good luck, I promise you it will get better :)|`|a7e9fedb043feadc2c38fb57da72355aaa	"BOUNCE".....

ugNH8FMYaa	Well, she's hateful & you can't help that.     It's not about making friends but making aquaintences at least to get thru the class. Smile at the people you know are good (not irrationally mean) , say "hey, how's it goin' " as you find your seat. If they don't say anything in return, don't let it get you down bc at least YOU tried. And that's all you can do.    Also, maybe let the teacher know that this girl is making things a bit miserable, maybe the teacher will move HER to a different desk so it's not obvious it's about you (if she moves YOU it's obvious).     Don't let Mean Girl ruin your day, just accept she's rude little person & get on w/ what YOU need to do for YOU.|`|xejwm2yVaa	ill be your friend! =)|`|EjfJaNn7aa	tell her to go shove a pineapple up her ***|`|mdtkor2Paa	aw, im sorry|`|cNv5PZTSaa	find the toughest guy in the group and beat the crap out of him    that will earn you respect, or at least fear|`|DuGKtqAkaa	It always sucks when you are moved during the school year.

I started to sit with some of the people in my class at lunch. As they got to know me they would hang around me and we all became friends in 2 days.  So sit with these people at lunch and get to know them well. Be social and funny. Do not be afraid to show your true colors, once you get to know people everyone will think you're cool. I hope this works for you so much! -HotSassyGirl|`|tHw6GAsfaa	If they don't talk to you, you should talk to them!  But don't even bother with that jerk that says she doesn't like you. Because really, how could she know that if she doesn't know you? Just ignore her. Now, anyways, I am shy myself, so I understand that it is hard to be outgoing.  I have people in my classes that are very outgoing, like the one in yours, but once you talk to them, they are totally cool.  And if you become good friends with someone outgoing, they will probably introduce you to a bunch of their friends.  And just because that one girl told everyone not to talk to you, does not mean that everyone is rude and arrogant like her.  There has to be at least one person that is descent and will hang out with you as soon as you open up to them. Good luck!!

I have to say, being perfect is the biggest imperfection a person can have. Does anyone want to be with someone who is better at everything than they are? You get what I'm saying, though, right?  So just being yourself is the most perfect anyone can be. To be around people that care for you is what you want, I'm guessing. Well, all these people that already like you probably like you for WHO YOU ARE. Which is who you should be. In your eyes, you're perfect. But everyone else they love is perfect too.    Perfect has so many different definitions.

For one, we are human, and that right there makes us impervious to making mistakes. ok, now im done rambling about that so i can give you some advise. Perfection is a hard thing to obtain, stay clean, do your hair, pluck your eyebrows. Learn absolutely everything there is to know about fashion and be confident. Good luck!!!!!
CLB32006aa	It doesn't make sense for her to waste $50 on a taxi. She is leaving her country to go live with you, she is obviously committed to you and you should trust her. Jealousy can ruin even the best relationship.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Well you won't know if she does or not, I'd say once you have her here you just need to make sure she isn't hanging all on your guy neighbors.|`|cp2182xNaa	She doesn't understand that it's a big deal for you. I know I've done some things against my boyfriend's wishes because it means absolutely nothing to me and I know it's not a big deal. Just talk to her and explain why. I don't think that particular one is irrational, cause I wouldn't want my bf and an ex girlfriend together.|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	It's understandable for you to not want her to be getting rides from her ex, I wouldn't want my girlfriend to get a ride from her ex boyfriend.|`|Umsj08pnaa	You seem very controlling and insecure.|`|OOzadIJFaa	well if you say that you'd prefer that instead of him giving her a ride then she might feel more pressured to and it's more likely to work and that isn't to bad a request unless you're over 35 if you are than  it makes you look a bit jealous|`|MHQVnqaXaa	yeah thats just controlling. Look, shes coming to another country to LIVE  with YOU. why does the ride to the airport matter any?|`|7tLDdtqGaa	yes. that is inappropriate for her to even still be hanging around him.|`|jf1oPsSeaa	you cant control her entire life, so if you feel increadibly strongly about it then tell her. but i think in the end you just have to trust her to be faithful to you even when she's with another guy. just pointing something out: if you don't trust her in something like a ride to the airport, how much do you trust her living in a different country with an ex who doesn't know that she has a boyfriend?|`|qpv8H3suaa	As a girlfriend even I must say that yes, you have the right to ask her to do favors like that for you.  Coming to see you and making you happy should really be worth more than $50 to her. You aren't wrong in asking her such things as long as you keep it polite. It's not like you're trying to take over her life your requests sound reasonable.|`|Uu8iCur8aa	Well I think you should just let her get a ride from her EX. It's over between them so he hug and kiss wont mean anything. If you want to make her happy just let her get that ride. After they give a hug and kiss she will be heading your way forgeting all about her EX|`|o28ymqckaa	Why would she even tell you that she was getting a ride with her ex? You don't need to worry because if she didn't like you she wouldn't move to another country for you. Let it go. She needs to come up with her own decisions. Tell her how you feel but don't hold a grudge or keep going on and on about it if she decides to do something you don't like. If she doesn't appreciate you then she's not the right one for you. Don't get too far into it but always say your opinion.    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|rjou1CGhaa	You two should have sorted out these and many other differences a long time ago.  The fact that you are deeply bothered by things that she considers "insignificant", yet saying so to us (Yahoo) and not to her, signals a serious communication problem that, as I said, should have been satisfactorily addressed BEFORE she made the monumental move to uproot herself to a foreign country, to live with you.    And why doesn't her ex know that she is in a relationship with you?  She's moving to live with you, for heaven's sake!  Why is she hiding her true reasons for moving?  She's lying to him, and you're lying to her.  This does not bode well.    You have to ask yourself - when she has done things in the past that have bothered you, why you have never said anything to her.  Whatever the reason, constantly holding back is causing a base of dishonesty and resentment that is bound to cause problems sooner rather than later.  Has it ever occurred to you that the only reason the relationship has worked as long as it has, is because the two of you were in different countries?  Have you ever lived under the same roof?    If she has already quit her job, left her home, sold her things, etc., then there is not much you can do but let her come, and let the relationship play itself out.  But you have got to approach her from the beginning with honesty about your feelings.  If it's not going to work, find out now.
mYAbq6fnaa	just tell your friend to back off and not be so aggresive. does she even have a reason not to like her? and then talk to the girl that came back to your school and just tell her, 'yeah, sorry about that. i dont know why shes being rude.' just something to let her know that you dont have anything against her really.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	talk tot he girl even though you dont like her your friend cant control your life.|`|d8effBuPaa	My son had this happen to him.  He was the one who people were being mean to.  His friend did not like this and told people to stop.  This friend also had a friend who was being mean to my son.  He told the mean friend, if this did not stop, he was going to stop being his friend.  It was had for a 5th grader to do, especially since he knew this friend for about 8 years.    I know it would be hard, but you have to tell your friend to stop or you will stop being her friend.  You really don't want the reputation of being mean.  Also, most friends if they are worth it, will want your friendship over being mean to his classmate.|`|5TXZpMtHaa	tell your friend to grow up or get a new friend.|`|O0iInu0Naa	Fights between girls never end, do not get involved directly but leave untraceable nasty notes about around the school telling lies about both of them.

Qc3nCsXnaa	If he understand and is serious, waiting should never be the problem...waiting for the one you are suppose to be with may be hard but it is not unreasonable.  He should see that you are trying to prepare yourself properly for that relationship...rushing never helps...take time to handle the baggage otherwise you will carry old things into this new relationship.  And your new guy will have to deal with it whether he knows it or not.  Its not fair for the new person...and it seems like you want to be happy but your gut is telling you its too fast...listen to your intuition! It can prove to be worthwhile in the long run.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	sometimes it's easier to deal with 'baggage' when you have support from someone who cares. Just be sure you are with him for the right reasons. A healthy person knows when to get out of a unhealthy relationship.|`|TaTCbLSzaa	caring man sounds like hes older the n you and your boyfriend but handle the baggage or itlll be just get worse hes already abusive  and he thinks he has control over you so take precaution bc he doesnt want to know that hes being left for a nother man thatll just bite him in the butt so handle things before you live you so called future happy life|`|AA12190953	It depends on if your in a safe place to be able to date him. If there is a chance your ex will hurt u or the new guy i would wait till u r officially out. If on the other hand there has been a mutual break up and u are just waiting to be able to afford ur own place, then i say go for it!! Life is to short to spend it being abused!!  Have fun

And ill tell u why I say that.I had a premme baby boy only born at 28 weeks ( and it takes 40 weeks to have a baby) with NO pain medication and in labor for 15 hours at 19 years old!And now he is the most perfect baby I have ever seen and so cute and so smart and so loving that I feel love is definetly worth the pain.I would do it all over again 100 times just to have him.|`|e6wo7czgaa	Love's a hard thing to describe because there is many different kinds of love. No love is going to be perfect, and not every love given can make you happy. When I think about it, love is worth it to me. But it isn't my everything- if that makes sense. Who even knows if love is just some thing we describe because we want that companion for the rest of our lives. And lust isn't love. Lust is for the body. Love is for everything- even the stuff you hate.  However if the love isn't turning into healthy relationship, that's when I usually have to walk away.|`|y6eqbv0Raa	Adrian DUDE you are so right|`|kB7UsIXdaa	it depends, usually yes|`|GMNKQxPraa	A woman will hurt a man 10x more than a man ever could because they are illogical and strange.So you tell me.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Rent the move "lovecactually"    Love is what we are on this planet for.

Leave them both and move on.|`|nz8o3lLSaa	Intervention, ldo.  Why didn't you think of that?    For your health!
gO9tl2uhaa	Well, yes and no. Can't expect your gf's friends to be nice with you after you cheated on her, now can you!    But, I don't think it was THAT rude. I mean, if it had been my friend, I would've told the guy something along ''one more wrong move, and I'll take care of you personally..'' (which is KINDA more rude!)|`|5BOV76bmaa	Not really since he is abit of a twat but he might take his anger out on your mate so i dunno|`|GutYNu9baa	No, good decision.|`|mdtkor2Paa	no|`|JmdnlQsHaa	i dunno i guess maybe ask urself how wud u feel if she had said to ur bf hey so do u want me to hook u up with this really niice girl?|`|wYTDwWnEaa	It was kinda rude but whatever.. its not the end of the world|`|vrfuO9Asaa	noo|`|O0iInu0Naa	No|`|SRPwwLJ9aa	it is in a way because she told you not to get involved and you've now gone and landed her right into an argument with her boy friend who right now in the back of his mind would be thinking what has my girl friend be doing with other guys behind my back. basically you have just created a domino affect which could split your friend up with her boy friend and if that happens you better hope she doesn't hate you for it, and yes i know the guy is a jerk but its your friends fault fro not dumping him in the first place and you can't force her too so it was a **** move on your part. but to be honest i think i would have done the same
4iUejzGvaa	It depends on how much you like the guy. Yes, like the other answer said put your bff first but if you *really* like the guy stay with him or tell him you will go out with him again after your friend cools down (she probably will let it go after time) If he waits for you, that means he really likes you!    hope i helped!|`|RtLPoDPDaa	DO NOT Put a guyy in front of yourrr bff.  You'll regrett it if one dayy the guy movess on and you've lost it alll.  Breakkk it uppp with himm, I'm sure you'll be fineeee.  Sorryyy, but it hassss to be doneee.    Good luckkkk though, giirlyyyy  LoLaaa. xxxx
1J1w1aJYaa	do you really want to keep wondering about whether he likes you or not every day? just ask him how he feels about you. sure some friendships can tend to get a little awkward afterwards if they don't feel the same way but if it's something you really want then that's the risk you have to take.    just follow your heart.    best of luck!

Just tell him in your sweetest voice and with your most loving eyes and be firm and tell him, then comfort him by saying but if you were to do this maybe this way or, I find this to be better or more attractive, or plesae do not take that tone with me, or can you possibly be alittle more considerate towards me, or lets sit and talk about something thats been bothering me alittle lately, I feel that you doing, or you've been acting, or the way you say or the way you are doing is making me feel unhappy or its not so becoming!,     Good Luck, and remember you come first!|`|AA11317725	I'm sure someone on here would love to tell him for you...|`|d985649c9ebb575112146640d0cc9e0daa	If you are talking about what I think you are talking about, then I hope this will help, if not, it'll at least be funny...lol.    First of all do not be attacking when you do it, he will not take it seriously, he'll only feel threatened. But it all depends on how he is acting about it, and why you are wanting to tell him. If he is just acting cocky and you are tired of it, probably the best thing is to use rational. When he starts bragging, tell him that there are roughly 3 billion men in the world and he's on top huh, there are lot's of men who have better ones. Heck show him picks online if you need to...lol. If it's because he thinks he does it perfectly and doesn't need to change, but you want some things done different, then tell him that things are great, but you would like to try it this way a few times to see how we like it. If he's not open to it, then there is a serious problem there. If he respects you, then he will listen to you and be open to suggestions. Good luck.
db7517a109cba0e250eff080ad4a3f04aa	I to have a man with a son and have felt the same as you just not married. You knew before you got married he had a son. It will be ok although him and his x share this son don't feel so bad, look where they are now. He married you for a reason, when you do have kids you'll feel great about it all and then the x will think what the hell I couldn't keep him around to keep my family together and as far as his parents they feel no different toward you cause of his son.

As a child from a rather strange family unit, my father married my mother after divorcing the mother of my older siblings, I had a hard time relating to my older siblings because I never saw them.  And I feel that I missed out on something special.  Just follow your heart and do what you feel is right.

Some people believe that the meaning of life is one or more of the following:    Survival and temporal success        * ...to accumulate wealth and increase social status      * ...to compete or co-operate with others      * ...to destroy others who harm you, or to practice nonviolence and nonresistance      * ...to die having succeeded in your purpose      * ...to live      * ...to protect one's family      * ...to gain and exercise power      * ...to leave a legacy, such as a work of art or a book      * ...to produce offspring through sexual reproduction or asexual reproduction      * ...to seek freedom, either physically, mentally or financially      * ...to seek happiness and flourish, experience pleasure or celebrate      * ...to survive, including the pursuit of immortality through scientific means (see life extension)     Wisdom and knowledge        * ...to be without question, or to keep asking questions      * ...to explore, to expand beyond our frontiers      * ...to learn from one's own and others' mistakes      * ...to seek truth, knowledge, understanding, or wisdom      * ...to try to discover and understand the meaning of life      * ...to expand one's perception of the world     Ethical        * ...to express compassion      * ...to live in peace with each other, and in harmony with our natural environment (see utopia)      * ...to give and receive love      * ...to seek and acquire virtue, to live a virtuous life      * ...to serve others, or do good deeds      * ...to work for justice and democracy     Religious, spiritual and esoteric        * ...to turn fear into joy at a constant rate achieving on literal and metaphorical levels: immortality, enlightenment and atonement      * ...to achieve a supernatural connection within the natural context      * ...to achieve enlightenment and inner peace      * ...to become God, or God-like      * ...to experience existence from an infinite number of perspectives in order to expand the consciousness of all there is (i.e. God)      * ...to follow the "Golden Rule"      * ...to produce useful structure in the universe over and above consumption (see net creativity)      * ...to reach Heaven in the afterlife      * ...to understand and follow the "Word of God"      * ...to worship, serve, or achieve union with God     Other        * ...to advance natural human evolution, or to contribute to the gene pool of the human race      * ...to advance technological evolution, or to actively develop the future human      * ...to contribute to collective meaning ("we" or "us") without having individual meaning ("I" or "me")      * ...to die, or become a martyr      * ...to find a purpose, a "reason" for living that hopefully raises the quality of one's experience of life, or even life in general      * ...to live, and enjoy the passage of time      * ...to have fun      * ...to protect humanity, or more generally the environment      * ...to pursue a dream, vision, or destiny      * ...to relate, connect, or achieve unity with others      * ...to seek and find beauty      * ...to simply live until one dies (there is no universal or celestial purpose)      * ...to participate in the chain events which has led from the creation of the universe until its possible end (either freely chosen or determined, this is a subject widely debated amongst philosophers)      * ...still some do not even think there is any purpose whatsoever (see nihilism)      * ...(This is actually an extension of the point immediately above) There is no inherent meaning to life, existence, the universe, etc. They exist because they can. However, humans appear to inately give meaning, usually many, often conflicting, to what they are conscious of. So, to each individual, the "meaning of life" is whatever they decide it is. In that sense, every point above is potentially valid.|`|AA11729235	Love- love is the meaning of life  for God is love and is God is love then love is life. God is the tru meaning of life because everything else is meaningless. your work  all your achievments.. your positions. all stuff you do but will be taken from you sooner or later its a promise. You came into this world naked and naked you will come out. you came with nothing and that stuff you gain now cant be taken with you when you die. those new jordans are meaningless because sooner or later a newer pair will come out. pleasure is meaningless because after a while you get bored of it. all that matters in life is God. that is it. everything else is purely meaningless. of course we can look for things now to make ourselves comfortable but later on either you wont want it anymore or want something else or someone else would have it.|`|9c1077c920e5136b7e2c047714b14873aa	hmm....

Desgraciadamente nuestra sociedad y desde luego los medios de comunicacion nos han hecho creer que la mujer ideal es aquella que tiene menos de 25, que pesa menos de 50 kgs. y que ademas debe de ser bella a como de lugar. Pero la realidad es otra completamente distinta, las mujeres, y sobre todo las latinas, no se acoplan al 100% a este concepto de mujeres, es un taboo que tendras que romper por tus propios medios.     Ahora bien, si lo que buscas es una pareja estable, te recomiendo que busques a hombres un poco mayores que tu, digamos entre unos 5 y 10 a?os mayores que tu, ?por que? Porque evidentemente caerias en el concepto de que el hombre debe de ser mayor que la mujer y un hombre que tenga esa diferencia de edad contigo creeme que se fijara en ti de inmediato.     No pierdas la paciencia, para el amor no hay edad o ninguna otra condicion que se deba de cumplir, ademas somos algo asi como 6,000 millones de personas en el planeta, te puedo asegurar que alla afuera hay alguien preguntandose lo mismo y en algun momento la encontraras cuando menos lo pienses.

0c668855de14186084a4e006f1e02732aa	There is no clear answer to what love is...I think that it is different for everyone.  It's a feeling that you get (not to be confused with lust) when you know you are with someone that you want to spend the rest of you life with (i.e. partner) or someone that you would do anything for (i.e. your children, parents, friends).|`|d85fb89c19bc7f2eb3efd0ad90758679aa	oh crap you would ask this lol.love is a powerful thing that has destroyed and built nations and drives some mad . the problem is we as youngsters want to feel love so bad that when our loins tingle we think oh my god im in love but far from it .love is if its true something that you wont ever be over or fall out of . to truely be in love is to share your deepest thoughts and emotions and your body later i hope with no inabitions and it makes you want to spend the rest of your life by this persons side . its a good practice to test your feelings before you invest your life in emotions in one person because love is thrown around too easy now days and later you find it isnt love at all. i have been married twice but i have loved only once and i fear ill never love again because now i know what love truely is and after all my ex did to me and still dose i love her deeply and i now wish id avioded this so this teklls yopu that you must be sure of  other persons feelings too or suffer later rejections.love means youd die to protect your lovedone and walk threw fire to be with them or wait a lifetime if need be. God needs to be involved in love and without him its a crapshoot. love is an ache deep inside that gets worse when your apart and turns to bliss when you come together . love is worth dieing for or giveing all you have to keep it going.love means you cant stay away or ever get enough of other person . love means you stay when other has problem or inperfection that normally youd take off but you stay. love is haveing a part of both mixed in one to bring life in this world and hear the word daddy and mommy . love is watching your mate grow old and holding his hand while he is dieing with no regrets . love is a bubblebath together and food fights for fun when no ones around . love is a flower that never dies but just blums over and over . love is your best friend that you just cant stop looking in his eyes while your talking .but most of all love is what you put into it and saying i do and meaning it and never letting go .stop worry about love youll know it when it comes and if he feels same then go for it and never look back .|`|9ce2a66f5a565258eac4dc0a76be2ac4aa	No one can answer this question for you.

My guess without knowing you is someone you cared deeply or were strongly attached to let you down in a big way while growing up. It is not always a parent either. It could have been a pet or a friend that moved away anything.    Until you figure out what and why you can't overcome the issue. Having admitted you have a problem however is a HUGE step and you should be very proud of yourself for admitting you have a problem forgiving people in your life. Too many go on blaming others and not accepting responsiblity for their actions.    To begin with be honest with friends and family, admit you have identifed this issue and ask them to help you deal with it and be paitent. Friends are ALOT more forgiving when wronged if they know it is not completly thier fault and that a friend needs help/space whatever to deal with an issue they admit too.    If your insurance doesn't cover therapy visits ask your doctor for groups in your area or speak to church members or someone you know who has the gift to forgive easily perhaps something they do can help you.    People love to help others when they are told they are good at xyz when it comes to relationship or relations with others as a compliment.    Good luck dealing with your forgivness issue and I am proud of you for taking the first step.|`|AA11107847	well you will have a rough life.|`|7ea6a4bb2e252744fa3af086883d8c38aa	Hun,,,would you care to ask the question in a different way so I will know what you are asking??,,,,what was the question??|`|1896301ce5f21c104303f57434e9b69aaa	Me too. when you figure it out let me know|`|ad78af0562ebab094efd1a7f4eba275baa	THE ONLY PERSON YOU WILL HURT BY HOLDING BAD FEELINGS IS YOURSELF,  IT,S LIKE HOLDING ACID IN YOUR GUT, IT WILL HURT YOU, NOT THE PERSON YOUR ANGRY AT, FORGIVING IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU|`|AA10704364	Strangely enough, the first  thing you need to do is to acknowledge your difficult feelings - validate them - feelings like hurt, anger, abandonment, betrayal, whatever they are.  - Say to yourself that you were indeed treated badly and that you have good reason to be angry and resentful and hurt.    THEN, have a look at what part YOU played in the incident.  Were you in any way to blame for the issue?  What could you have done better?  Did you in fact cause some of the problem by your own behaviour?  Of course, we all have a part in problem issues.    Once you can recognize that you yourself were partly to blame for this, can you then see how your own defects of character may have been partly to blame for the incident?  If you can recognize and accept that, then you can ask for forgiveness for YOURSELF for the negative role YOU had in the situation.    Then once we can ask for forgiveness for ourselves, we can say, if WE deserve forgiveness, perhaps those who hurt us also deserve forgiveness.  They have their own difficulties in their own lives and possibly were not aware that they hurt us.  Or if they were aware, they are not perfect, nor are WE perfect.  So we then forgive those who hurt us as we wish to be forgiven also.    If we truly want to have peace of mind, we take it one step further, and see if we need to make amends to those people - asking them for forgiveness for our part in what went on.    These concepts are incorporated in the 12 Steps of the Anonymous programs which are truly a path of healing.    Good luck

I heard it for the first time a couple of days ago and teared up while I was driving in my car. I was the only girl in my family and that Daddy/Daughter relationship was really special. Now I'm 33 and have 3 boys. I just had my little girl 2 months ago. Because of health problems, I know that she will be my one and only little girl. As I listened to this song, I thought of my Dad, and I thought about our daughter, I thought of her growing up, getting married and how my husband would feel. He is already so in love with her.     And as far as crying the whole night. You will. They'll be tears of joy and happiness. And no matter what song you dance to with your Dad, you'll cry the whole way through it.     Congratulations on your special day, enjoy the dance!!|`|345c1338f5634a7cacadf4c2f88307b9aa	I Loved Her First - by Heartland  here are the words to the sond         Look at the two of you dancing that way   Lost in the moment and each other's face   So much in love you're alone in this place   Like there's nobody else in the world   I was enough for her not long ago   I was her number one   She told me so   And she still means the world to me   Just so you know   So be careful when you hold my girl   Time changes everything   Life must go on   And I'm not gonna stand in your way     But I loved her first and I held her first   And a place in my heart will always be hers   From the first breath she breathed   When she first smiled at me   I knew the love of a father runs deep   And I prayed that she'd find you someday   But it's still hard to give her away   I loved her first     How could that beautiful women with you   Be the same freckled face kid that I knew   The one that I read all those fairy tales to   And tucked into bed all those nights   And I knew the first time I saw you with her   It was only a matter of time     But I loved her first and I held her first   And a place in my heart will always be hers   From the first breath she breathed   When she first smiled at me   I knew the love of a father runs deep   And I prayed that she'd find you someday   But it's still hard to give her away   I loved her first     From the first breath she breathed   When she first smiled at me   I knew the love of a father runs deep   Someday you might know what I'm going through   When a miracle smiles up at you   I loved her first|`|9125742707ee1d71468c9a87cfe90e65aa	How about Daddy's hands its a very good song.

En ella, entre otros comentarios, comenta que el mexicano est obsesionado con el tama?o de su miembro, en lo que estoy de acuerdo (me incluyo), pensando siempre que es ms chiquito que el del "otro" (sea quien sea). Tambin dice en la misma entrevista, que por ejemplo, los japoneses tienen un tama?o promedio ms reducido que los mexicanos, lo opuesto que los miembros de la raza negra en general. No obstante, los japoneses, dice ella, no slo tienen fama de ser buenos amantes, sino que "hacen maravillas" en lo sexual con sus mujeres, en tanto que los otros, no les llegan ni a la planta del pie. Al responder al lgico "?por qu?" del entrevistador (un mexicano), coment que el japons en la intimidad es considerado, tierno, cari?oso, respetuoso, imaginativo, fantasioso incluso, todas cualidades que concuerdan con la idea de relacin sexual que tiene la mujer en general.  Dicen que no es el tama?o lo que importa sino cmo se usa lo que uno tiene (adems que si slo se usa el pene, qu tristeza y desilusin para la compa?era, ?no creen?).  Estoy de acuerdo, aunque no conozco a los japoneses ni a ningunos morenos oscuros para opinar al respecto.

Anyway when I was in school we all had a crush on our 7th grade couch he was all that. But we just admired from afar .And at the end of the year we were on to the next grade, it left our minds as we was on to better things . To carry out on it could ruin someones entire life , it's not worth that.|`|AA11050227	You gotta be careful.try not to get involved with him. you can make him loose his job and you you can even get kicked outta school. This is something pretty normal that happens to anyone. I had a crush on my gym teacher when I was on 9th grade, and I got over it.

Intorduce yourself. If he introduces him-self back, then you're on the right path, and then if he gives you a weird look, ask him what his intrests are,get to know him better and if these work, remember you'reonly friend (I think) and then catch a couple movies togther, then ask him out.

cf012fa6c525a669c3dd1b8b24730eccaa	Well, the dirty truth is you can't force anyone to fall for you. A big pointer is just to be youreself and don't take desperate measures to get his attention. Don't do anything that you wouldn't normally do or will regret later. If doing something like that gets his attention and eventually you stop acting/doing that then the reasons he became attracted to you in the first place disappear and it can harm the relationship. Plus, you don't want to go around acting like someone you aren't for the rest of your life anyway.    You really want his attention, walk up and say, "hi, my name is__________." and if you're uncomfortable doing this alone have a friend introduce you. Perhaps one of your friends' boyfriends will know him and introduce you to him. Whatever you do, make sure it feels natural, even if it makes you a bit nervous or jumpy.|`|ef88a8ae3afde5ec4c890c32c8b9c3faaa	Don't worry about it.  The right one will come along someday and you'll be fine.  As for your friends; I'm sure you can always have a 'girls day' and have tons of fun.  You keep your friends for life.|`|969f443e9cc27a0263acef17eb07aabaaa	be patient...things will happen as they are meant to. I'm sure you really want a boyfriend but you shouldn't try to "get" anyone to like you. Be with someone who has an equal attraction to you as you do to them. It may take a while but remember..patience is a virtue!|`|9abc9affcb5ab996fb393b6a9ce7583baa	hi...    what's up? listen...don't worry. try to keep ur beauty as silence. i mean u have leave ur fastness. then u have to take care about him and most important matter is that u have to understand what he likes or not. u have to do the things what he likes. when u see him just observe him..    take care....
791b6d33cd2ad36286a2495c0b8b7bd7aa	Just come up to him and start talking to him. Most guys like outgoing girls. Where clothes that show off your figure. Flirt like crazy to show you like him. Make sure you don't become his best friend. Make him see you as really hot and in a way girly. If he doesn't ask you out, and you feel like you have waited to long, then ask him out.|`|329c9d1d9e5729ed2afb300286b8655daa	just tell him before another girl gets it|`|ece15568e308f45c6a2f99778a52d190aa	Guys like girls who are outgoing. Have you ever spoken to him before? Since you both are jocks, then you have some common ground to talk about. When I want a guy to notice me, I think about stuff that he likes, and then I go up to him and talk to him about it. Sometimes, the small stuff is the stuff that guys notice the most. Flirting is a good technique to get the guy to get the hint that you like him.|`|93336b69698c2344bdf3624ca1c68401aa	Hmmm. I think that you should try talking to him. Talk to him about your daily life -- but dont blab to much about yourself too! Try to find out a lot about him and try to relate to his interests. Treat him like you wouldn't treat any other guy and if you're brave enough (most girls arent! Including me..lol) ask him out. But you totally dont have to. Just try to get to know him more; relate to his life.  Does this help?  Fashion Fantasia  P.S. If you ever need any fashion advice, that's my job!

You shouldn't have to 'impress' anyone in order to have a simple conversation with them.

17943d4ec71dc654eed2c6a1927bd54faa	contrary to popular belief, confidence doesn't come from "having sex" ...... it is way beyond that. let's say u have had sex, but u still feel uncomfortable about ur body or something, ur back to the drawing board when ur single again.    so, my advice to u First before u even get in a relationship, is to work on Yourself. your confidence will translate to Way more in ur life; urself, ur ability to speak to others, ur relationships w/ family, friends, teachers, peers, even strangers, and THAT will lead u to find a good person, and THAT will eventually lead u to sex! :) not that it's ur "goal" per se, but what my point is that u need to learn how to be Happy, Positive, and Healthy on ur own two feet, which makes u attractive to others, and it won't matter whether or not u have sex or not, and will open many doors for you.    SO:  work on your Appearance! exercise, work out, take care of ur face, hair and body. try on new flattering clothes, get a new hairstyle, etc. the better u feel about your Looks, the less you will feel uncomfortable or shy around girls or guys!    Next: work on your Mind! study, read more, learn more, learn about current events, and excel at hobbies and interests.  the more you Know, the more u will have to say in conversations!    Finally: work on your Relationships!  first ur family and close friends.... speak out more, be your fun self!  practice your new style and knowledge with them... slowly put urself out there with friends of friends at parties, be confident, happy, and comfortable, easy to talk to. speak out more in classes, get to know ur teachers, or if u have a job, work hard and get to know the managers and other co workers.  remember, since u are not as stressed about ur looks and ur ability to talk about different things, u will have more opportunities to put in ur two cents!  :)    it's a process, won't happen overnight. but trust me, the better u feel about urself, the easier it will be for u to meet new friends and stuff! good luck~~~|`|ec403c111737b018fce0d4de29efe71caa	poor thing all u have to do is talk to the girl u like and later ask her out. i have no confidence but i still talk to the one i like but just be urself and someone will notice ur a great guy and like u too. just be a little patiant|`|0d38be70c2f99b91dfbc5fc68621be7daa	oh you poor thing!!!!! all i have to say is to just talk to a girl who you feel really comfortable with. start conversations hang out more be creative funny nice etc. and if appearance bothers you than a new look always helps someone. not to be mean but a new look will work out for you it does for anyone. be patient your tI'me will come be yourself im sure your an interesting guy.|`|4286419b80146becc7eefc807e1c93f3aa	i think you need to make some "girl" friends.

I was 25 before I was married, and had never dated much. I was a nerd (still am I guess) and not real attractive, so I knew I had to take action. I updated my clothes, and made sure that I dressed neatly. I started visiting churches and other get togethers. I enlisted a couple of trusted friends to help me meet girls. I met some really nice girls. It was trying at first, but as I gained a little confidence, I began to open up and be myself. One day, I met the girl of my dreams in a most unlikely place (supermarket) - we have been married for 35 years. It wasn't all easy, but you just have to be determined about making a change. Good luck on your quest - there is some nice girl out there waiting for the opportunity to meet you.|`|4d1ad1ba9da55b067ee81fadd5c8f732aa	How old are you?

She is the princess that day and just make her see that at night. Get a decent hotel room. Buy like 30-40 candles (dollar store but all white!) Get champaign (dont forget the glasses cause plastic hotel ones are tacky). Get flowers... dont overdue it cause its a waste of cash. Buy like 2-3 dozen cheap ones and pull off all the peatals and lay them around the candles and all over the bed. Get strawberries and chocolate syrup... and make a CD with all your favorite songs with her... slow ones are good. If she is not happy with that then sorry guy! Oh and get a room with a hot tub and fill it up 1st with lots of bubbles and rose petals. Dont let her in til all the candles are lit so plan it well. Good luck. Be yourself though.

Essayez de prendre du temps ensemble, de faire des choses qui vous plaisent  tous les deux, bref de profiter de votre nouveau statut de mari et de femme !|`|fb735a686475a8f46af1ef258887f4eaaa	je dirais pas que cela est normale mais il faut un certain temps d'adaptation ce sont en fait deux familles diffrentes qui viennent de s'unir chacun  t lv avec plus ou moins des coutumes diffrentes  laquelles il faut s'adapter mais cela ne vient pas du jour au lendemain, faites des concessions, et lui en fera aussi, apprenez  voir au travers de l'autre ses qualits et non ses dfauts ce sera plus facile|`|85aac75cd8195a1fd2b7b145afa06610aa	Apres mon mariage tout allait bien mais au bout d'un an on divorce.

Maintenant, il ne faut pas dprimer... Mais, il faut ragir et se poser la bonne question, enfin les bonnes questions :    est-ce qu'on s'aime?  si c'est pas le cas..ben dommage, mais en gnral on ne se marie pas pour rien..  si oui, il faut parler et s'isoler des extrieurs (amis, parents, etc ) qui sont toujours prsent, et veulent vous aider voir vous conseiller.  Hors, il est temps de faire votre vie..    de plus, je note que tu dis ON....s'engueule..donc toi aussi tu rales??? non??    prenez du temps pour vous, parlez et tout ira bien..si vous tes fait l'un pour l'autre.  Surtout, prenez du temps pour vous, profitez de la vie apprennez  vous retrouver comme avant ce "foutu mariage.."    pas d'enfants trop vite..on sait jamais en cas de vrai soucis..voila..c'est mon avis

AA10704364	I'm so very sorry for your loss.    There is a chatroom called:  Grief Recovery.    Don't hesitate to go there.  They will understand exactly what you are going through and it will be helpful.    There are Stages of Grieving which were codified by Dr. Marion Kubler-Ross.  She was the first to counsel with those who were dying and their family.  These are the stages:    1.   Disbelief  2.   Denial  3.    Anger  4.    Bargaining/Depression  5.    Acceptance.    If I have had a loss (& unfortunately I have had several lately), I will write the first heading on the top of a page.  Then I will write everything that that means to me in this loss.    Then, I will do the same with each of the other headings.      It is very helpful to do this.  It validates the shock and horror and in this case, the outrage at what happened.    Don't be surprized if you get angry at other people - that is 'misplaced anger'.  The anger is actually at the death of the person but it gets misdirected to someone or something else.    You are very young to have to deal with grief.  I hope you have a benevolent Higher Power to turn to for solace as well.    Best wishes.|`|AA10980939	first dear my condolences on you loss, dealing with such a loss is very difficult to understand much less come to terms with. the black cloud that hung from your friends sounds like he had a death wish only to hurt himself. i applaud you for your ability to recognize such things as such a young age that shows your highly sense of caring & believe me intelligence. with time i am sure you will evenutally learn to live with loss & use it in your life what i mean you will be stronger for this experience.|`|8fa16e22229c58714014173174b4479daa	live well, laugh often, love much.  Life is not the way it's suppose to be.  It's the way it is.  The way You Cope with it is  what makes the difference.                        sorry for your loss|`|1a2dacfac5aba8394697c5e361616db5aa	It's never easy coping with the death of someone that you care about.  Try to remember that it will take some time to get over the loss of this person but one day you will be able to think about him and how he was always in a happy mood.  We all go through grief at one time or another in our lives. I lost my sister and then my mother in the course of 3 months, that was hard.  You and your family should sit down and talk about this, it helps to get our emotions out and to cry. If you have a Pastor that you can talk to, that would also be very good.  God Bless You!

dd1f927248c50b7511137071de2458a5aa	If its ment to be, its ment to be.    Your best bet is to stay in touch and see each other as frequently as possible.    I knew this one guy, he loved his g/f soo much, every weekend, he would go down to see her.  (note that its 6 and a half hours away from her by car.) This guy shells out lots of doe, but man, he's my example of devotion. If you two are willing to endure the distance, than make sure you two have a back up. Long Distance relationship can fade if you don't work on it.    Thats all I have to say    Cheers|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	hey if its love and i mean real true love u2 wont forget

You can try the Weddinglenox matching system http://www.weddinglenox.com/membersignup... that will match you up with local vendors. I tried it and have good result as I only recieved email from vendors according to my request.    One problem I had with my wedding is that it is hard to locate vendors in most website as most likely they group by states and there are too many of them that's too far from me and I have to look at each site to figure out.    The sites I provide above have a easy to use layout to show you pictures, pricing and location in one page plus, you can send out your inquiry for matching vendor to contact you. That save me lots of time to locate the best vendors with the right price.|`|c70dbca5d98c118d332b9daf80b45fc1aa	I don't know if they are inexpensive or not, but try Michael's or Tall mouse.

I found www.afloral.com. We found a beautiful white gardenia wedding garland that we were able to hang across the ceiling of the reception hall because it was so cheap. They also had bouquets for all the girls in the ceremony flowers for the pews including clips to hang the flowers, white roses which we placed in julep cups and placed around the church. We ended up spending around $500 for a ton of flowers. My aunt even thought we spent over $10,000 for our wedding decorations and offered to help with the cost. She was blown away by the fact that in total for decorations we spent less than a $1000. The wedding was great. She thanks me for finding the site every time we sit in her family room and look at the flowers displayed on her fireplace mantel.

tcXlsHr7aa	I don't believe you are going to like this answer   but here goes       You can not convince your girlfriend  that she wants or would like a threesome   Its something that she has to feel comfortable with , its something that she would want.  I can tell you from personal experience   you may lose her if you push too hard.    Is it something that she has expressed a desire to have ? therefore she needs that  little push ?   Bringing a third into any relationship can be detrimental if you do not  TALK   communicate or  really  express thoughts and desires  with all parties involved.    Ok I will get off My bandwagon,  of course My thoughts are personal thoughts.   With todays  changing attitudes towards sex , it might be totally acceptable without a  question.  But  TALK  communicate with her ,    Do not do it for your own selfish  reasons     Good luck|`|3Hv4XucJaa	try not to be rude. try and state as a wondering thought. or jus go straight to her and ask.    if it fails STAY FAITHFUL!!!|`|7b59127b1cd12ae518ce27c2f82aa3f3aa	excuse me but threesomes r nasty and dirty ,too much into one place and its something that makes me feel i am with a whore or two whores ,|`|AA11591306	You dont.

A person should be on their best behavior during the first dates. If anything stands out as irritating or otherwise, negative, it is very likely that this trait will reveal itself stronger as the relationship develops.    Your questions should be limited to to the surface stuff like,    Where do you live?  Where did you go to school?  What do you do for a living?  What jobs have you had in the past?  Where were you born?  Do you like ??? (dancing, shopping, movies, music, etc,...)  Do you come from a large/small family?  Do any of your relative live nearby?  Where do you like to vacation?    There are many of these type questions. The answers that you receive should give you an idea of where to go next. for example,    Q. Are you from a large family?  A. There are 5 of us children  Further Q. Where do you fall in the lineup?  A. I'm trhe middle child.  Further Q. Was that a good or bad place to be in?    You get the point. Important. You need to come off as being interested in these things rather than conducting an interview.|`|419e7a0a08f294d1927c5b15ac740e02aa	Do not talk about bad past relationships or old boyfriends. If you have trouble with only talking about yourself, stop talking. Ask him about his favs...movies, sports, pets, t.v. If he brings up something you know a little about, dive in and give your opinion. If something comes up that you would like to know more about, ask him to tell you about it. Most importantly, be yourself, smile, and have fun.|`|AA11957106	When you "click" with someone the conversation just happens.  If it takes some efffort ask about him|`|USSJQXjPaa	Before I answer your question, let me share with you the single best piece of dating advice I ever received.  It was from my college roommate.  He said that all you can expect from a first date is to simply have a good time.  Dont worry about whether the other person likes you or what your second or third date will be or anything else.  Go into the first date expecting nothing other than having one good date.  That's it.    Your question is easy to answer.  People like talking about themselves and their interests.  It's natural.  So ask him what his favorite sport to play is?  Baseball?  Oh really?   Why is that?   blah blah blah.   Eventually you will pick up on something else to ask him about.  Voila--a conversation is born.  He'll pick up on something to ask you about.      It's the time-tested way of telling whether a date is going well or not.  If you find yourself at a complete loss what to say to the guy then it aint working out.

Meeru Readyya !|`|7edb005fffc860fa080393ebd8da2e72aa	Why do you need a boy-friend when you're married ? Does this mean there are issues in your marital relationship. I personally feel that at this age probably by having a boyfriend, you are looking for some fun and thrill, to be straight-forward, you are not able to tune your lust. Well, am not against anything. But here are my points.     It's not easy to get a cultured & a decent looking 40 or 50 yr old guy becuase he definitely is not looking for a girlfriend. But believe in luck. Hang out and always keep hanging out. Try to attend all sort of parties, exhibitions and start making new acquaintances. Talk to all sort of people, especially the guys. Even the 20 yr olds sometimes won't mind having a 40 yr old girlfriend.     Just follow these and make use of the feminism to the max. The rest will happen automatically ;) Holler back for any questions.|`|e6e62e339a9d8bd71ad706bf8d5c12e1aa	y not u can have friends ,age is not an issue ..u have website like ...orkut.com ...zorpia.com, yahoo chat|`|kcHkFG4Paa	Make yourself presentantable and smile|`|HE42sPv0aa	need more details:    where do u stay?    abt ur job(if working)    make a profile in www.orkut.com and upload ur photo in it.    if possible , email me above details.|`|0536218f21dae304ecaa4391248a09e8aa	Many of the chatters have responded their opinion to you    One thing madam,getting a boy friend is easy,but getting a true boy friend is difficult.|`|b586a510632ff6943019c18d72e4fcaaaa	Find a guy whose in his 40s..|`|AA12327693	dnt think just catch me ....o_sum69@yahoo.co.in|`|63dab0af18edf62824cfe6b5d081eeb4aa	hai htis is mastan . i am intrested to be ur boy frin if u accept me . actu8lly first we wil be frins for some days later if u like me we can be one . my mail id is neekosam7@yahoo.co.in . waiting for u.|`|e36c5a73cd638b22540846bd7d187efcaa	Trust me.

AA12039079	I know exactly how you are feeling.  Like you, I had a best friend who meant the world to me.  She and I use to talk every day but then she got engaged and now I NEVER hear from her.  At first when I wouldn't hear from her at the end of the day (we use to talk every day) I would become sad and depressed.  Days would turn into weeks.  The only time she would talk would be if I would leave her countless messages.  I have now grown to realize she was just a fair weather friend.  And I am angry at myself for having wasted so much time and energy on her.  It especially hurt me because I have a hard time making friends and she and I were so alike and had so much in common. I thought I had finally found a best friend.  I was wrong.  And it sounds like she just used you for the time being until something else came around.  Sorry.|`|5ba7e599587a82a614241436482f2000aa	some people just grow apart and maybe she doesn't like you being so reliant on her maybe she felt good for a time that you were quite persistant in kepping the friendship going i have a v.good friend who i have known since i was about 3 and i am 26 now we may not see each other from one year to the next and we live about 2 miles apart but if we needed each other we would be there sometimes thats just how people are|`|22be5faed0c844a0c4a17a6b9438e176aa	You sound very emotional and in need of a good honest decent friend and shoulder to cry on.This person who has let you down used you to get off her chest her problems but obviously as you know has not returned it to you.You have started to do the right thing in not calling or texting her and going out with your other friends unfortunately it will hurt for a while and finding  somebody who you can trust and feel relaxed around and be close with will take time.Maybe for your own problems and issues you should see a counsellor as they can have an objective and outside view on your situation.....good luck.|`|32f6ad1dd2134e05fff3e94031245a01aa	I have just came out the exact same situation and I did the same thing which you did and went for weeks without speaking to her but she didn't make any attempts to speak to be which made me think that she wasn't bothered about me.  What made the situation worse was that the friends that I spoke to about the situation supported me and said that I was doing the right thing by ignoring her, but I took a step back and viewed the situation and realised how miserable I was making myself by not talking to the one person who meant alot to me.    So i emailed her and outlined exactly how I felt and she emailed be back and now we're closer than ever.  It was really hard to pluck up the courage to email her but she understood and she told me that the reason that she didn't speak to me was that she thought that I was the one who wanted the friendship to end sometimes you just have to be brave and be honest with the people you care about and whatever happens is for the best    good luck with everything    x|`|cpWbgDxUaa	You cant possibly not tell her how you feel if you want results im afraid, and no i dont think she cares for you as much,. a lesson i was taught recently was that people are never the same , what you may feel about something she may not , you cannot make her feel the same as you! you can only accept the way she is.|`|ft3bZQB4aa	try writing a letter and explain how you feel but dont be too harsh

What about her reputation? Sounds like she's got some REALLY MAJOR things going on in her life. If she doesn't get some help, she's in trouble!Sounds like the type that's showing suicidal signs! If you get that self destructive, something must have happened that hurt you really bad... broken heart... raped... abuse. She has to have some kind of mental issues though to be doing something like that! Maybe it's a severe depression!    I could never imagine doing anything like that, and if I knew anyone who did, I would talk to their family & friends about getting her some help! Time to check her into the loony bin for a while to protect her from herself!|`|FWoYTZ8Kaa	Never done anything like that before!|`|K0leinLNaa	she is just a s l u t and has low self esteem|`|AA10451155	Its sad really, one that she feels the need to sell herself but also that her friends where there and did nothing.

I agree with your assessment that it would be difficult to face that person in the mirror the next morning, but stupid kids do stupid things.  I think you should be cautious about remaining present when things like this occur--it will only take one incident before you are questioned as a witness to some weird event (that results in a criminal proceeding).|`|6c4acae1af4f9fbc02be7ea19029dc7caa	I think she should go into business for herself

J7mSnQPpaa	Hon I have feltt like you feel. Let me tell you just some of the things I awent through. I moved about 21 times by the time I was 19.I went to a elemtnary school in an inner city where a gang of black kids assaulted me almost everyday for the whole yr.My parents kept going to the principal nothing changed.I got into fights with bullies about every year or with some idiot who felt they had to prove something by fighting me. I was rejected by pretty much all the girls because I was heavy most my life.Dont call it quits tho hon, GOD does love you and has a plan for YOUR life.HE wants to use you like HE has other men and women of the Bible.  If that wasnt bad enough my self esteem got battered when I got home with the wild raging fits my mom had the fights and cussing etc.I could go on and on.I realized later though that my childhood would NOT last forever and I could leave home. I quit school after 9th grade and got a G.E.D. College is NOTHING like grade school or elementary school. I have to say here that it was GOD that restored my self esteem because HE knows everything there is to know about me.Every bad thought or deed Ive ever had or done and loved me anyway.HE loved me when no one else did or would. HE also had to teach me to think differently.If HE loved me enought o become human and die for me then why shouldnt I love HIM back.My life has only gotten better since I started livingg for HIM.One other thing I learned even before that though is self honesty.It was NOT your friend's fault that you dumped your b/f to go to the rpom with someone else, that was YOUR choice. The idea was in your head and you went for it,obviously you thought and felt your b/f wasnt making you happy and was looking for something more from someone else.This would have happened eventually anyway. Do not make your past the CENTER of your whole life, just keep reminding yourself that your past is just that,past nothing can be done about it now but you CAN have a happy future.Get the book by dr laura schlessinger called (cant remember the title0 people with crappy pasts? look 2 drlaura.com and click on the book sections.GOD has done so much for me HE delievered me of  depression and bi polar without doctors or meds.If you want  to contact me my e-mail is  josephfleeman@hotmail.com.Theres a lot more to my story I didnt post here.|`|32e654482c6148c0b399460caf758334aa	Finish high school  If you still want to go to college, do so  Start anew with new people  Start with a new chapter in your life  Regain your confidence and be yourself  The past is the past and now is the present so make the best out of the present  From all the experience and memories allow yourself to only grow stronger and wiser.|`|aZp507G0aa	First I want to say that God Loves You.  You have had a tough time and I know that people have treated you very badly.  I also hate that no one is listening to your cries for help.  If you truly feel this way...I wish there was a way that I could wipe away your pain.  But you can't let these people win. Doing something harmful to you or yourself will only give these people something more to say about you.  They want to see you go crazy.  Don't give them the satisfaction.  Understand that no one can make you feel anyway. You choose to feel that way.  You choose to take their comments and actions to heart.  Let their actions roll off your back....It's hard...but it will save your sanity.  Please go to someone else and talk to them.  Talk to a counselor and have them talk to your parents for you.  Talk to a police officer and have them talk to your parents for you.  But talk to someone.  Keep trying to talk to someone.  Never think that taking your life or someone's elses is the answer.  You have the rest of your life ahead of you and you deserve to be happy.  YOU WILL BE HAPPY. God is a good God and only wants the best for you.  There is some good out there with your name on it.  If you take your life, how will you know what it is.  Ignore the people, graduate from school, and go to a college where no one knows you and start over.  Take control of your life. Stop letting those people control your thoughts and feelings. Be happy regardless of how they TRY to make you feel.|`|AA11541126	stay strong and stay in school. when you graduate, go to a big college. you will be able to find people that you fit in with. there are very few people who go through college without meeting people they can hang out with. i thought i was close with the people i went to high school with but now i talk to one of them. all of the other friends i have now i either met in college or at work after i graduated. just don't give someone else the power to control your life. you are THE ONLY one who can decide how your life will go and whether or not you will be happy. why would you want to give someone else the power to control that? as rage against the machine once said(about a different topic but it fits), "you gotta take the power back."

There's free state parks you can hike/bike. Bring a picnic. The museums in & around Cleveland are all reasonable (compared to where I live now). I would go to Nelson Ledges State Park hike and go in the silly arcades & get a bite to eat/drink.    The Flats, walk the mall & then eat. The Cleveland Orchestra & the Cleveland Ballet sometimes have free "under the stars" events.    NE Ohio is close to some of the amusement parks in PA that you enter & pay per ride unlike the ones in NE Ohio you must pay to enter.    What is that place I think near the Airport their rides are inside. Lots of reasonable-priced theaters. I use to go to Akron for those & see some decent shows.    Be sure to browse Friday's paper.    My friends & I use to make things cheap, for example, if we wanted to see the Air Show but we could only afford to do that or eat out. There's lot of places to park without paying admittance to the Air Show but you see the Air Show you just can't see the planes close up & then you eat out :D    Not sure what part of NE Ohio you're in -- have fun, summer never lasts long enough up there but they have probably some of the most beautifu & appreciated summers of anywhere in U.S.    Sharon, PA has stuff too...the chocolate place, the Quaker State Wingz, that place with the long name that decorates a million trees at Christmas time.    enjoy!!

Debes esperar precisamente para que ese sentimiento que ests experimentando se apacige, porque como quiera que sea la muerte de un ser querido o cercano te deja muchos nudos por desatar.  No cometas el error de tener una ralacin cuando todava no te curas de la anterior.

Honestamente yo te sugiero que puedas dejar pasar un tiempo para que puedas superar tu luto, (hablo del luto psicologico), debido a la muerte de tu esposo, que es muy reciente; en cuanto al hermano de tu esposo, no digo que no sea sincero, pede ser que si lo sea al expresarte su amor por ti, pero, ?te has puesto a pensar lo que el hermano de tu esposo sentia por tu esposo?, quiero decir: tiene tres semanas que fallecio y ya esta a tras de ti? Como que para mi es muy apresurado por parte de tu cu?ado. Ademas de que puedes estar confundida por los remordimientos que tienes y creo que al tratar de estar con tu cu?ado estarias buscando una forma de reivindicar esos "errores" que pudiste tener con tu esposo, ten mucho cuidado con esto.      Ponte a pensar tambien en todas las implicaciones familiares que habria si tu accedieras a estar con el tan rapido, pero en fin, la vida tiene que seguir y adelante con ella.

Todos necesitamos sentirnos amados e importantes, incluyendo a todos los hombres, por machos que se sientan o pretendan ser, todos tenemos nuestro corazoncito y necesita de amor.     El hecho de que un hombre huya ante sentimientos tan nobles como el amor es debido a la cultura machista que tenemos desde siempre en nuestras culturas, sobre todo las latinas.     Si el hombre a que amas huyo cuando le dijiste que lo amas, en mi opinion es que no te ama como tu a l. Lo mejor es que sigas buscando a esa persona ideal para que corresponda a tu cari?o y amor. En este hermoso planeta Tierra habemos algo as como 6 mil millones de personas.... estoy seguro de que encontrars a alguien que no huya cuando le digas: "Te amo".    Bueno... eso digo yo!

No es lo fisico que te hara feliz, es su forma de ser, y lo que sienta por ti.

Lo que dice tu novia es cierte pero a veces no. Es decir que todo depende del cuarpo de tu novia y como reaccione al medicamento que ella decida tomar. Algunes veces puedes subir de peso pero tambien puedes bajar. Mira un ejemplo en mi caso yo estoy usando el metodo de la inyeccion me dijeron que podia tener efectos secundarios tales como aumento de peso depresion dolor de cabeza menstruacion a cada rato etc si esque no reaccionaba bien mi organismo al medicamento. Me dijeron que en ese caso yo deberia de usar otro metodo ya sean pastillas, el dispositivo u otras cosas. Aquie el chiste es que se pongan a experimentar con los metodos. Yo tome esa decicion y bueno en cuanto me pusieron la vacuna pues me puse a comer bien hacer ejerciocion y a hacer otras actividades para no deprmirme. No me paso nada de nada y ya llebo 9 meses con este metodo. Por si te interesa este metodo pues te dura 3 meses y a la hora de tener relaciones pues no necitas usar condon. Bueno mejor vayan con el doctor para que les explique mejor.  Creo que debes hablar muy bien con tu pareja y tomar la mejor decicion. Por mi parte yo preferiria tener unos kilitos de mas a tener un hijo no deceado! Despues de todo los kilos de mas se quitan con ejercicio pero un hijo....  Cuidate mucho y te deceo lo mejor.|`|980uOz8Caa	Lo primero q deben de hacer es visitar a un gineco, si sabes q todos los cuerpos reaccionan diferente yo podria decirte unos pero no se como reaccionaria con tu chica ademas para recomendarte algun aticonceptivo te realizan pruebas de ormonas y no se q para q no te ocacione reaciones secundarias tu mtodo.Que es lo q tu chica quiere no tener una reaccion desfavorable.

Let's try doing things a little more different then you have been doing in the past. Take her out if you can, remind her why she fell in love with you in the first place. She might just be going through a phrase that will pass over. If she needs it give her time and space. MOCK MY WORDS don't make the same mistake I made before in trying to get answers out of her.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola Cristi.       El tema que tratas es muy delicado, ya que el da?o que le puedes producir a un infante al darle maltrato fisico o psicologico de cualquier forma, es reprochable, si a eso le aunas que sea un abuso sexual, con o sin penetracin, es an peor.    No importa del pas que seas, estos actos deben de ser denunciados siempre, en cualquier momento, de lo contrario corremos el riesgo de que ese maldito, (perdn por la palabra, pero no puedo decir unas peores para calificar a esos enfermos...!) siga comentiendo esa clase de abusos con alguien ms.     Denuncien todo ese tipo de abusos, no importando el tiempo, con ello detendremos a esos mounstros que abusan de nuestros peque?os...!

If he likes you alot, never cheated before, and hasnt done anything to make you not trust him, then in order for your relationship to work your going to need to learn to trust him.

It burns around 300 calories an hour.     And a good session at least three times a week boosts the heart, halving the risk of a heart attack or stroke, a study at Queens University in Belfast has discovered.     They say regular sex also boosts circulation and keeps down blood pressure.|`|Q9dVBfHZaa	men is like that

However, if you set the humidifier on a small, slip resistant rug it will help absorb the noise and make it quieter.  Change the door bolt to a locking type and don't share the keys with anyone.

AA11709677	You've already done so by surviving.      You've already done so by apparently doing some very serious self examination of life itself and realizing that people, ex-boyfriends or not, truly are good at the core despite all the crap in our daily lives.    But I know the guilt of which you are referring to and it's normal.  Your ex showed incredible and wonderful selflessness and probably would have done the same for any of his friends, past or present.  It's in his nature to do so I would think.    Donating a kidney is a painful and uncomfortable procedure.  Kudos to that brave young man for doing so.    So if you want to let him know how thankful you are for his sacrifice so that you may live, here's a suggestion for you:    Privately, secretly, contact your local paper and tell them your story.  Tell them you want to express your love and gratitude for what he did for you by planting a tree in a park in his honor, dedicating it to him.    They'll run with the story.  And try very hard to keep it a secret from him and involve his parents in your secret.    The fact that he gets surprised by this act on your part for he and his "above and beyond" the call of duty act of ultimate chivalry, will let him know you've not only survived, but your heart is on track.    I'm glad you lived.  It's things like this that change people and the world at large.  Your new guy is probably a very wonderful guy also, I assure you, he'll be proud of both you and the ex-boyfriend for all of this afterward.    Good luck and now, go and LIVE LIVE LIVE!    It's just my best suggestion; you can take it or leave it but it's the best things I could come up with......|`|MATiTs5Oaa	I think he still loves you  no matter what you did to him.  There is sth my mother tells about mothers.  When people say that the debt to mothers can never be paid, she says that what we owe to our parents, we pay back to our kids.  This guy gave you a gift like no guy would.  You can't pay him back.  What you can be, is to change in a good way, to be more giving socially, for the common good of people etc.  Never forget you owe him one.  If he ever needs help, be there.  Good luck with your new kidney and your new life.    |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	marry him|`|01d5aa28e8119b28808a80780cc05d5eaa	wow.  Send him a letter.

He should be getting a house or a car or something....  That's a big favor he did for you.  |`|vqm10k3Jaa	What can you really say besides    Beside Thank you, and say it in person.    But he sounds like a "man" who loved you with all his heart.|`|ePgixobaaa	For 7 weeks, send him a different thank you card each week.|`|G1FzdCs3aa	Take him out for a nice dinner and thank him. |`|9f44Wsz0aa	Start treating people with respect. Learn what loyalty is. One day, he will probably need you too. So your integrity will be tested (hope that you have some integrity now). Or if it is not him, then someone else. And if someone one day treat you like sh!t, then remember that you were once forgiven. So one would expect you to forgive too.|`|VQPtZhTRaa	Sounds to me like you life changing experience has made you grow up and mature a bit and the best thing to do in accept your mistakes in life and grow from them which it appears you have.   Next..the apology.  Never say sorry for something you dont know what you are apologizing for or that you feel no remorse for.  Since you have both of those covered its time to move forward...  Be honest with him..admit to him what you just wrote in your question. and thank him for still being willing to help/save you even though you know you hurt him.  Maybe there is still a chance at having this person as a terrific friend in your life.    Good luck|`|W1ADv5hOaa	get back together. tell him why you did what you did and tell him what you need in a guy. apologize and try him for a second time. just dont cheat on him.  good luck|`|RTZrVLzSaa	Wow. To me and I'm pretty sure everyone else it seems this guy still cares about you. For him to do that after you treated him so horribly and doing what you did and for him to go take it upon himself to actually give a part of himself to you says a lot about him. Not to be a total ***** but you do not deserve him. I know you are sick and I am so sorry for that but for you to take that from him, I do not know if there is a way for you to pay him back...ever. And I do not even know if you should even accept it. How do you feel about him, because obviously if he does this for you maybe there's an inkling that he wants to get back with you. Would you be willing to give it another go? Would you be able to be faithful? You need to think about it long and hard before you accept the kidney and if you do you have to show a little more than gratitude towards him. I do not know if there is a way to pay him back but a simple thank you goes a super long way. Who knows, maybe ya'll will be the best of friends for the rest of your lives? That would be such a nice thing for the both of you knowing he did that for you and you could always count on him because I know there are not a lot of guys willing to put their lives on the line for someone else who did that to them. Be thankful. Very thankful.|`|q2fRETWqaa	Well first off, you need to learn to be a better person. You should know what a good person is like, because you've dated him for 18 months.    After you think you've changed, then thank him. Hey. Even thank him now. He'll feel good about it.      But You definitely need to Not suck at being a person.|`|UkwHcwe8aa	wish him be happy|`|Ht5YATjdaa	JUST SUCK HIM OFF A LITTLE|`|uW2roneTaa	He seems to have REALLY loved you.  i bet he still does.  tell him that you are very grateful that he saved you.  say it in person.  the most horrible thing to do is send a letter.  he deserves more than that. start a new friendship with him|`|7jwhTsTGaa	Hm Guess the first 'person' has an advertising agenda... Ignore it.    That is a hard one.  So you permanetly have a part of him inside you..  Wow.  Most people give away their heart!!  Do you still have feelings for him- do you want to get back together with him? Or are you happy in your new relationship?  If so then you dont want to do anyhting to sabotage your new realtionship- and you might want to run any plans past your boyfriend so that he knows that you dont want to get back together with your ex, just thank him.    It sounds like you have a lot of mixed up feelings- guilt, love, reliefe...    It also sounds like your Ex is an amazing guy, but I hope what he did was for the right reasons (and not just because he thought that you would get back together). 18 months is a long time, so im sure there are feelings hanging over from that.    If you want to get back with him, make sure it is for the right reasons, and maybe think about doing something together.  If you dont want to get back together, then maybe get him somthing he can enjoy, something just for him (or he might think you are trying to get back together).    Dont do anything out of guilt, just do something out of love..friendship love or otherwise.    Maybe write a letter to him explaining what he has given you.  It is more than  kidney, its life.  If you have dreams, plans.. then do them, or his kidney was in vain.  If there is somewhere you wanted to visit, go- and send him a postcard.. It will probably make him so happy to see you doing things, being happy, achieving...    As for thanking him, there are no words or actions that can do that.  Just promise him your unconditional friendship.  If he needs an ear to talk to, someone to play computer games with, someone to go to a concert with, someone to go to the hospital with..  support hhim in little ays- like if he lives near then see if he wants to come over for dinner.. see if he needs anyhtign from the store when you go..    Bigger thank yous... might cost a bit of money, but ifyou spend time ofnt hings then it could be an amazing thatnkyou.    Are there any bands he likes/ places he wants to visit/ family he wants to see but who live too far away?  If so then you can always try writting to them/ try and get tickets/ get things signed/ pay for a flight somewhere.    Also there are tv shows/magazines/charities/awards that will help you to achieve a wish or a thank you- especially if he is taking longer to recover.  IF you are short of money and there is something ou want to do then ask your family, i'm sure that if each of them chips in a small amount (and your friends/his friends) then you could buy him the means to an amazing memory.  One that when he is old, he will be glad he helped you becuase he got a great friend and a great memory of a lifetime out of it.    Also the most amazing vow you could make to him is that you will NEVER cheat again, in any realtionship.

BL8EDNXRaa	well... someone needs to tell her to stop acting like a little kid (mind you they take care of their problems better)  and do something about her problem if she wont open up to anyone and also tell her  to do something to fix everything other than complaining about how messed up her life is because at the end of the day you can only live this life once and so might be useful to make it worth while other than make it worst and more depressing than it already may be, i do that alot to my friends and they dont open up straight away but eventually they get it.    but make sure you dont show pity towards her because when kids annoy or complain everyone always tells them to go the right way and leads them through times like this but when teenagers and adults make mistakes it seems like no one does try pointing or guiding them but only comfort them. which is no good as they dont want comfort but want help but wont say it as they feel its pointless.     you need to help and let her know no matter what you'll be there and that you can tell when she's upset as you know her better .|`|vBM2kn94aa	Buy her the book, The Game of Life by Florence Scovel Shinn.

c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	First find out why she hates you.  If it's because of something you did, the next step would be to apologize (even if you didn't do it on purpose or if it wasn't your fault)  If she just hates you for no reason, talk to her friends and ask their advice in what you can do.  Don't buy the wii, its expensive and might seem a little weird coming from someone she hates.

4v0XDwtkaa	Just lean in, close your eyes, and let your lips do the rest!|`|anaaY9DRaa	i have been through the exact same thing.    1. be confident. if you think you might kiss badly don't worry about it because i doubt any thirteen year old boy has had a good kiss. to become a great kisser takes practice. plus don't say "i may be a bad kisser" or :sorry if im a bad kisser" this will make him think of all the reasons you are a bad kisser. if you don't say anything he will just be glad he is getting a kiss from a girl and most likely enjoy it no matter how awkward.     2. make sure your breath smells nice. i wouldn't chew gum because when you run out of the flavor it makes your breath smell nasty, plus kissing with gum in your mouth is difficult when it is your first kiss. make sure your brush your teeth and pop a mint in your mouth.    3. find the right guy. i know your desperate for a kiss. i know i know, but when you look back on your first kiss and find it was with a great guy, then experience will be even better.     4. g before you are ready. if you wait and wait and wait to kiss him you will just become so reluctant that it might not even happen. when the mood is right and you're alone just go for it.    5. ok to the actual kiss. the lean in is the biggest part. RELAX. tense never works well. try to put your hands somewhere, like on the side of his face, on his shoulders, or hold his hand. then tilt your head to the side to avoid bumping his nose. leave your lips natural and touch his with a bit a bit of pressure. don't make a big smoochy face, just move them slightly in accordance to his. i'm sure you will want a closed mouth kiss since it's your first. you can either give him a peck or your can kiss him for an extended period of time. if you want a longer but still closed mouth kiss then either put your bottom lip between his lips and kiss his upper lip or put your top lip between his and kiss his bottom lip. move your lips to the rythm of his and alternate top and bottom. if he tries to slip his tongue into your mouth then you can either take it and move yours with his or pull out. if you take it dont just attach your mouth to his and tongue wrestle. pull out and in and touch tongues, then go close mouthed and back again. but im sure you'll want a close mouthed for your first. although the info above gives lots of tips, don't think to much about these during the actual kiss. trust me, instinct will take over so trust yourself and don't overthink. it will only make the kiss less enjoyable.    6. finally if it doesn't go well and you slip up or he does DON'T WORRY. i have friends who actually missed the person's mouth on their first kiss or bumped noses. it will feel horrible at the time but you will laugh later. just try agin because believe it or not practice makes perfect.    hope this helps. remember: confidence, nice breath, relax, and practice practice practice. sorry i wrote a lot bu i know what ur going through. i wish you the best of luck!!|`|b82ybE3gaa	um, first a kiss shouldn't be planned, cause that takes away from the "magic" because its like "hey I wanna kiss you in my backyard at 6:30pm ok?" And that's lame.    But for actual kissing advice, follow him, tilt your head slightly to the opposite side and kiss him just press your lips against his, if he tries to slip a tongue in there massage it with yours...have you ever seen cruel intentions they have like a whole tutorial on it. =)|`|b1LINCDkaa	ur a fagit|`|dIcF9x76aa	Before the Kiss-Get your lips in proper kissing order. The most kissable lips are smooth and sweet, not dry, chapped and tense. The guidelines in How to Get Kissable Lips will help both men and women make their lips look more attractive and inviting. Here are the basics:    Exfoliate your lips with sugar to make them soft.  Moisturize your lips to keep them soft.  Relax your lips by parting them ever so slightly.  Look inviting and approachable! You might not realize that you've giving off a "leave me alone" vibe, so read up on How to Look Approachable. Uncross those arms, keep your hands away from your face, make eye contact, and smile! Similarly, read his or her body language - is this person into you? Or do they seem uncomfortable?  Break the "touch barrier." Touch the person lightly on the arm or shoulder when you're talking. Just make it a quick, innocent touch and don't make a big deal out of it. Holding hands is also a good way to break the touch barrier. (Guys, you may want to read How to Touch a Girl for more ideas on how to break the touch barrier without overstepping boundaries.) If everything is going well, try kissing the person on the cheek. If you find your lips near their ear (like if you're hugging someone from behind, or whispering something to them) go in for a gentle kiss on the cheek and see how they respond.  Approach for the kiss. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partners body or head into positionyou just want to guide his or her movement a little, you dont want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable positionbut in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partners lips, maintain eye contact.    The French Kiss-As you are locking and re-locking lips, brush your tongue against your partner's lips ever so slightly. This should make it clear that you want to French kiss. If your partner's tongue does not respond in like fashion or if they pull away, you will have to save the French kiss for another time when you are both ready.  Slowly open your mouth a little bit more and gently push your tongue a little farther into their mouth until the tip of your tongue meets the tip of theirs. Let your tongues brush against each other briefly and gently and then pull it away, back into your own mouth.  Close your mouth a little (not all the way) and open it again to start another kiss. This time you can push your tongue a little further into your partner's mouth, so that more of it brushes against theirs.For a passionate kiss: Put your hand(s) on your partner's face, neck, or hair and hold them close as your tongues meet. Gently suck or nibble on their lips here and there. Breathe deeply. Kiss the person like you just can't get enough of them, and like you might never get to kiss them again.  Finish off a French kiss with a little lip locking (as described in the previous section) or continue kissing, in which case you'll want to read the tips in How to Make Out.The Platonic Peck  Turn your head before you lean in. If you want to kiss someone on the cheek, and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in.  Pucker your lips more tightly than you would for a romantic kiss. To know if you're puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible "pop" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed.  Keep it brief. The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step - nothing more. If your lips linger, it won't seem so platonic. In some settings, it might be appropriate to not make any lip to skin contact at all; read up on How to Air Kiss.
lHDq5gEraa	Hmmm this is a dilemma....but ask yourself how you would have felt if she did what your doing to her. Would you have been ok with it or would u of acted the same way she did?|`|zTQaREymaa	You've done nothing wrong. Your friend is over-reacting.
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Kettie, it was pretty quick, but you all have such a mixed-up history together - it's hard to know what is fair and what isn't.    So, the best you can do is decide who is more important to you - your friend Sammie or your ex.     If you choose your ex, are you prepared to lose your friendship with Sammie?

6013eadb367671c8e96a255a79beba72aa	Red, she is confused. If she just recently became single then she is insecure and probably blaming herself for the relationship ending, wondering what is wrong with her. Girls are vulnerable and you would be rebound which is not fair to you. Just be a friend, which is what she needs. Someday she will realize how awesome you have been and open her eyes, but until then, do not pressure her or she will pull away from you and you could lose her for good.|`|DK6kYxmGaa	If I were her, it would be may way of saying "no for now".

AdTnizwOaa	Talk to him about that. If you are afraid of it happening again then just tell him so he knows what to watch out for. It seems like you get attracted to him when you guys are just friends and being yourselves but then you lose interest when you go out. I think he's trying too hard when you guys are going out, by doing that he's well...doing nothing.    So next time you have recess take control and say something along the lines,    "I know you like me, and...I think I like you too. But last time we went out, it just was boring and we never talked. I'd really like to spend more time together if we do go out again." if you guys went out before you should talk about it.    Don't wait for him to talk, you do it. Yeah life sucks like that, but...it's how you get happier endings =]|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Keep dating since both of You like each other and be patient.

DK6kYxmGaa	Hmm, does your parents know about this? How did you get her number----did your friends hook you guys up, or is this some girl that you've been talking to online. If you've been talking to her online, you definitely need to let your parents know before meeting her. You can never trust people online, so beware.     When meeting her, be yourself. Talk about what you normally talk about when you're texting. Good luck.|`|USbujSnCaa	if ur 14 dont shake her hand be like hey whats up hows it going? complement her clothing and if u dont go 2 the same school ask her where she goes 2 and what her fave thing 2 do  and her fave hang out spots!!! good luckkkk!!! :D

T75X8OLyaa	Forget her! Trust, once lost, is not easily regained. She didn't go too far. She did the right thing by dumping you. Now leave her alone. If she can't find anybody better than you then maybe she'll come back to you but you have to face the fact that you really screwed up by paying attention to the other girl when you already had a girlfriend. I know that I would not want you as a boyfriend!
TtxkbLRdaa	No, I wouldn't avoid her, I would want to stay friends and not have anything awkward between us.  And yes, he probably likes her if he is very open to her.|`|5f3f6xAwaa	I actually have 2 girls at my work who have a crush on me, on of them came out very aggressive asking for dates and wanted to hook up and s on.... that was simply I just told her I wasn't interested, but the other one I am not avoiding at alI keep my distance but talk to and i think we have a healthy relationship.. but I think some guys do avoid  the girls whom likes him just to avoid conflicts... and guys don't like to say no to girls :)
AA10941788	Great wording!!  Very classy there!!

You need to leave him.. before you get hurt|`|n1gaa7Yxaa	Well , i'm 14 and it'll sound strange maybe i don't know your age , but i have the same situation , i mean my boyfriend is very jealous of all my friends, ALL . We have been going out for a year , we have had lots of problems , but whe we were like 8 months he started to know new girls and we fought everyday , we broke up almost every week , and weren't happy , even we felt we couldn't live this way anymore , we keep together .. then he cheated on me with one girl there and it was so painfull :/ he staterd a pre-relationship with her for like 15 days then he came back and say that he couldn't live with out me .. that he loved me and blabla .. we sit , and talk and talk . Started again , everything is good now :)  If your boyfriend is TOO jealous , just don't do stuff that will make him fight about it , for example , my boyfriend doesnt like me hugging my male friends , so i just don't do it . Or if my boyfriend tells me that he's jealous because i spend night with my girls , i tell him the truth , even if he start fighting .. If you really love him , just talk to him , and try to make him feel SOOO GOOD , even if it's hard to keep going .. if he stars fighting just let him fight alone ..   I hope you guys to be happy :)!|`|By2QtFigaa	i used to have a bf like that. except i only went out with him twice. hes not worth it.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	To be honest, it's better just to be friends then if that's what keeps happening.

All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	if you think that he is worth it. then talk to him and work it out|`|s4M7tJU5aa	it could be bipolar    but more likely immaturity... just dump his sorry ***|`|LoaiXMsRaa	i had that and we eventually broke up for good. were still really good friends but were seeing other people for now. if i were you id see other people...and if you really love each other youll come back to each other.|`|SsoNkOTZaa	All couples go through rough patches. Now of he's been doing this the entire year you have been dating then you should worry if you guys should be together. If its just here recently than tough it out, and eventually it will get better.    Was he always a jealous guy? If not that could be a sign he's cheating. If he's always been jealous then its just who he is.

KbKEjfdtaa	If you are already masturbating together and have told each other that you are bi-curious, it sounds like he probably wants to try it with you also.  You have 2 options.  First, you can wait until you are masturbating together and just reach over and start masturbating him.  The second option is to ask him first, but I would still ask him when you are naked together masturbating.  You're much more likely to get a "Yes" answer from him when he is really horny, like when you guys are naked together.  I say go for it, and don't wait just get your courage up and either just do it or ask first, either way sounds like it would be ok with your friend.|`|2SSD6BP9aa	So just ask him!  If you are already masturbating in front of each other and you have both told each other you are bi-curious, then there's nothing in the way.      Next time you are together for that just say "hey want to try stroking each other for a change?"  You can be pretty certain he will say yes to it.    And don't listen to those who say you are gay.  You are the only one who can know that.  Right now you are just experimenting because you are curious.  Maybe you are gay.  Maybe you are bi.  Maybe you are straight and you'll grow out of being curious about stuff like this.    There will come a time when you are certain, but until then don't worry about putting labels on yourself or your friend.|`|AA86ypBaaa	Woooooow  intersting  Welll i guess since yu guys are very comfortable wtih eachother like that then i guesss just get into the topic and ask him, im sure it wont be weird|`|w5DAHDeSaa	ewwwwwwwww|`|vO1dtPQHaa	You can't because when you cross that line both of you are friends for life, or both of you are gay. No offense but that is really final.......|`|Zta4vVqjaa	Well you guys are comfortable being naked in front of each other but the thing is... is that you both are guys of coarse! Well go for it but don't make it so your gay! Well go for it but don't let anyone tell you that your gay or even tell you that your sick because it's your life so live it and don't let anybody ruin your fun! That's it.
gO9tl2uhaa	They didn't! The cavemen were doing it like monkeys (animals)....    I saw this horrible movie about cavemen when I was 13.

aez7WCqQaa	I would dump him. He's obviously not mature enough to understand the meaning of love, and he's willing to throw those words around too easily.    You need someone who will be more worthwhile.|`|gp5KrhrPaa	Tell him that if he really loves you enough, he can wait for you to love him back.|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	If he truly loves you he shouldn't be angry if you don't feel that special spark yet. He can't say that so soon anyway, and he can't claim to love you if he can't stand that you won't say those three words back at him. Let him know that.|`|cb10953b2f0dad5e0861aa07228435e5aa	wow. I've said that before. Tell him to deal with it. and would he rather you lie to him? I think your pretty brave for being able to tell him that you don't love him, because it is definitely difficult. good luck. but if he doesn't accept you after you tell him all that, tell him you think you need somebody to accept your feelings for what they are and if he wont do that then your leavin. good luck.|`|bj5Hq83uaa	whoa... not a good thing 2 say. ummm just apologize. say u were havin a bad nite and that you DO love him|`|cmFU81rQaa	You did the right thing.  He has to respect that he can't make you love him or expect you to fall in love with him just because he did you.  And maybe you will later.  2 weeks is a very brief time.|`|MIgwYj5uaa	explain to him that love takes time...he needs to be patient  if he doesn't accept it or respect what your saying hes not the one for you  you can't rush love...|`|wybTIqXVaa	Wow. Nice. I don't think I'd have the power to say that to my boyfriend. xD But yeah. Tell him you definitely aren't ready to say "I love you," yet because you don't feel it yet. Tell him if he really does love you, he'll understand. Love takes longer than two weeks to experience. And if he doesn't understand? He's not worth it.
jp9OzuXoaa	She's a lesbian.|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Well I'd be a little weirded out... and maybe she's just trying to scare you. Wouldn't be the first time i've heard of girls doing that.

PSWxnBIwaa	Try to see it from her point of view. Maybe she doesn't have anyone else to hang out with and just wants you to like her. If you absolutely cannot spend another day with her, find her some new friends. Don't just entirely abandon her. Think of the stuff she likes and then find people who like the same stuff.|`|vO1dtPQHaa	Get her another Friend or just slowly stop talking to her.

Chances are, they're probably wondering why you havent had one YET!|`|sYyNyjwuaa	I'm sure they would react completely different than youre expecting. They will probably be happy and offer to give you two a ride to the movies or something. Ask her out, it can only get better from here! =)|`|CPxmHjx4aa	just talk to them..youre at the age where they know you will b interested in girls..remember they were teenagers once...  theres no reason to b terrified of by talking to your parents..  good luck and i hope she says yes|`|MKHd10MYaa	I know how you feel. It's natural to feel nervous and scared about telling your parents something like that. I would feel like that too if I was in your position... too bad my parents won't accept my boyfriend because "16 is not mature enough" for them yet.    Anyways, it's good that you want to tell your parents right away about something like that. You definitely have more guts than I do. I think you should just say it. Like, go with the flow type of thing. Perhaps start it out like, "Dad, Mom, there's this girl and...." and then continue from there.    Just go with the flow!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	They don't have any rules about you dating do they?  Time to get over talking to your parents.  They can be helpful.  More helpful than your friends.  Maybe at dinner, casually ask them for their advice.  Say you like this girl and want to ask her out.  You never know, this could be the perfect opportunity to open the door to communication with them.  You never had a girlfriend before.  It's worth a try.|`|H5sKLKKsaa	Well talk to them first I suppose, nothing terrible can happen except them saying that you're too young.|`|67z7HHTJaa	stop being a pussy and tell them!|`|OafbteCxaa	It isnt a big deal  you can tell them  but you dont have to either|`|sD1SZXEmaa	just tell them that you have taken a liking to her and they'd understand. They don't want to ruin anything. Even if they want to, they cant. It's your happiness, dude. Go for it. :D|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	eh, i just went up to my mom and said "hey, i have a boyfriend."  it's not hard, really.|`|GabGD8DUaa	i have never told my mom she has always found out on her own. my boyfriend that i have now she found out like two weeks after but im not sure how. and she is fine with it.|`|e49d36a8d05eb91e3d230719de7b60a9aa	well u shuld tlk to them and see wat they think. And if they say no then that is probably a gud thing. because ur parents wouldnt want to do anything bad to ya. and if the ysay it is ok go for it|`|7uczaVUcaa	i am having the same problem  ugh  my parents never understand and i am 15 to   email me some time|`|MHQVnqaXaa	just dont tell them? dating isnt a huge deal when you're just 15. relax|`|ap6KKOjFaa	just tell  ur mom and dad that u want to ask this girl out|`|5fe1d29bd466e79a18a65a07d90f084faa	Well I think the best idea would be to make your parents feel like you appreciate their advice. So I think that before asking this girl out, talk to your dad. Just take a nice deep breath, and then walk up to your dad and say "Dad could I get your advice on something?" and then your father should be really happy that you're asking him for advice and then ask him something like "I like this girl, how do you think I should go about it?". Parents will appreciate the fact that you're asking them for their advice. Unless your parents are really strict about dating, they should be really fine with it. Just remember, they are your parents and they want what's best for you. :-)     Good luck.|`|5iOk6Domaa	just ask her out. Then later on say to your parents "i am going to go to a movie/dinner (or something or whatever you are doing) with [insert girls name here]" most likely your parents will be like "ohh is she your girlfriend" and you can just say "ya" then the awkward part is over. And you can talk to them about it more.|`|zBpnFhQ3aa	Well, I'm 17 and I just got my first bf, and I just kind of told my mom I was having plans the next night...and she asked the usual with who, where stuff, and I told her that I was going to a movie with this guy...and it just kinda went from there. Believe me though, I was afraid to tell them, but I figured the worst they could say was no, but she  let me go and she gave me my first ever curfew...yeah, up until I started dating I had no curfew...actually, I only have a curfew when I'm out with him...anyways...that's the way I brought it up.|`|2RGMEUloaa	It would help if you mentioned WHY you're so deathly terrified of them.  In any case, if you like this girl, ask her out. They should not have any control over who you choose to love. My son has dated lots of girls I never knew about or met. I don't necessarily like that, but it's really none of my business. Now if he comes home saying he is serious about someone, I want to know her.|`|HDbGE5ECaa	well if i set up a date my dad has to see the guy 1st then i get to go but i have to come back at 7:00 so go ahead and try it out but obey ur parrents     ps.DON'T GET IN TROUBLE|`|AA11139702	I hear you.

KZ6x4234aa	you know I'm not all that popular but I do hang out with the "so called popular kids" and all you need is to hang out with the "head of the crew" "the so called main one" if your seen with this person you instantly gain attention, but the only thing you really need to becoming "popular" is a well clean look, you do this by having a great haircut, shiny hair, "not greasy" get your nails done or at least color them in with a cute nail polish color, always wear decent clothes I don't know if you noticed but the "kool kids" the girls r never too revealing, so look decent always clean, and with cute hollister, vans, cute boots, american eagle, anchorblue, or wear anything that looks cute, and try to whiten your teeth, and wear neat fragrances like victoria secret or any other body sprays that smell great!   And try straightening ur hair if you don't already do so, and   don't over do it with the makeup, basic foundation, powder,  blush, and a pink lipgloss will do it!  Just feel comfortable with yourself, b/c when you feel pretty you look pretty that's the REAL catch.|`|GMNKQxPraa	There are many ways but to be 52% popular show your boobs all the time that way all they boys and any lesbians will like you. Unfortunatly all the uptight girls will hate your guts.    Joke answer Ty ;)
2GQv8dfgaa	well it might be a little too late at this point of time in the school year. wear just hollister, go to parties, talk to the "popular" people (you know it really doesn't matter in high school its all middle school crap) and idk...JUST BE A FUN PERSON and theyll like you don't be scared. just be chill..its hard to explain. but it doesn't freakin matter in high school im just letting you know.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	don't try to hard. update your clothes to make you stand out and show your unique style. show how confident you are. don't go along with everyone eles. be your self. it will come if you really want it to. confidence is the key. hope this helps!|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Hun. (No homo) You don't go to the popularity, the popularity comes to you. Just dress how you feel. If your feeling preppy wear preppy clothes or whatever. Being popular isn't everything, but then again to some it is. You'll find the right group of friends if you just dress like you.
AEZ75dJ7aa	WOW I am sooooo  proud of you kiddo and your parents will be too.  I do think you should talk to your parents about this because they can not only protect her from this perv they can protect other girls (maybe even younger than Sally).  They can also talk to her parents and help them through the shock and pain of this.  Your super smart and a very good friend.  You sweetie make me smile and see hope for our future generation.  Keep up the great attitude and strength!   God bless.|`|e9W9g5tzaa	You have good instincts kid! Protect your friend even from herself.

If you do you should just go out with her.|`|9CUaikUEaa	yeah id say it probably is, when you know you got friends, and people to hang out with/talk to then you generally feel better.  at each house you stay in, make friends in each place and hang out with them whenever your there, they'll look forward to seeing you more if you arent there 24/7, but you just need to spend a lot of time with them when you are there.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	try to make more friends at school who you wouldn't think to be friends with. have some friends who are girls is always a good thing like my best friend is a guy and it is so cool. hope this helps|`|U9EwARTKaa	yeah being around girls obviously make you a lot better with them so i would suggest start texting some of ur girl-friends that you would like to know better or by talking to them on msn then maybe one day when u dont have wrestling ask them to hang out with you|`|WpDISIzRaa	just take some time and make friends.. both boys and girls.|`|jg3bbxR8aa	no, very healthy to b friends w/ opposite sex, unless ur gay, which i don't think u are. um, sometimes i feel that way, to. be urself and talk to close relatives that u feel comfy with.|`|WuckBywsaa	these feelings seem completely normal for your situation and age and the only advice i can give you is to wait these feelings out.|`|L88c0dU0aa	there are a lot of guys who dont hang out with girls.  but if its really bugging you then just go up to a girl and talk to someone.  start little so you have to find someone that dosent intimadate you.

dnoJPmG7aa	Go for it...ask him out. If he is shy he probably needs some encouragement from you. Also he will most likely be more himself if he is in a comfortable situation one on one.

AKv9hWXAaa	Um...I was with a guy for 3 years and then we broke up. Time helped, talking to my friends. But time, time is what helped me the most. It's been 5 years.

Ummmm I'm crazy all right....|`|Ki90Irkcaa	I would forgive him, but I would definitely not see him again. He wanted a free pass to go have sex and then he wants to come back to you when he was done. You don't want to give him the idea that its ok, so don't go back. Say its cool, but you cant have your cake and eat it too. Don't get upset because that's probably what he's looking for. If you play it cool then he wont expect that reaction and it will surprise him. But for sure move on.|`|vrfuO9Asaa	no way!! i would dump him|`|oFFOHxCFaa	never.    wouldn't even have to think about it.|`|4TXQje2Daa	no.|`|nmqLgXM1aa	slap that bastard right in the face|`|0qlhvmwGaa	no  you need some time too  time to find someone  who cares for you and respects you  this guy is nothing but a tool|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	no, nothing really to forgive, he was just trying to let you down easy by saying he needed time, plus it leaves the window open for him to come back later if he wants to, and you let him. I think he just basically broke things off, so no need to forgive him, just tell him you think he should have just been honest with you.|`|gY1YOXRHaa	No i Would Never!! xx|`|1QcAJ35taa	depends why he left|`|7quYBN4gaa	no absolutely not. he's pushing boundaries. if you forgive him and let him back in your life he'll keep doing it. find someone who respects you and doesn't feel the need to take a break and sleep around. you deserve to be loved not cheated on|`|6d7mzfUoaa	haha      plaaayyyyaaaaaaaa x]    fo sho xD    lawlz|`|oGv4wJgtaa	no!!! definatly not.   he seems like a bit of a player  dont go back to him|`|voO1HrDLaa	No, i don't think i could. but on the other hand, you two were not together so it is not like he cheated on you. Some times a guy just needs to go with a few other girls to realize how good he has it. I don't know the whole situation so I cant tell you weather to forgive him or not. Do you love him? Do you think he loves you? Do you think he is ready to commit to you and only you from know on. You need to ask yourself and him these questions because if he is not ready then you are only setting yourself up to get hurt again. good luck sweetie.|`|EcVVcgZNaa	NO! what are you kidding?|`|AA12065689	kick him where it hurts in front of everybody and tell him how he likes it getting dumped than dump him and go and enjoy a drink , you deserve better than that and don't take him back even if he crawled on all fours.    you will get over him tell your self that , if you want me to be your B/F i am free.|`|tCFpxamyaa	NO....LET THE RAT GO|`|e5ZaMxigaa	i probably would, but that's me, and i forgive easy.|`|ZxI8SgMFaa	NO! What a stupid question.    the plonker is obviously not ready to commit if Ever!|`|tWwgiYN7aa	hell no!!!! u deserve much better...he clearly is an a**hole!!!!
hcc8fq7jaa	Being assaulted doesn't make you a different person, and it doesn't mean you're broken, or anything like that. It will probably make you rather cautious with whom you trust, and that's ok. Any decent guy won't view you differently for what happened-if they do, they're garbage. It's very normal to be afraid of getting hurt again. When you feel ready to date, go slow. Make sure the guy understands that you want to take things slowly, at your own pace-not his. If he pressures you- walk away. He isn't worth it. As far as telling him about what happened, that's for you to decide. You don't owe ANYONE an explanation. It isn't his right to know what happened, and you are not obligated to tell him. It's no one's business UNLESS you choose to make it their business. Never forget that. If you do want to confide in someone, make sure you can trust the person first. People don't always react the way you want them to. Good luck.|`|XMLYXQKAaa	ya i would not do that kind of stuff that's like the last step to take i think there is more than just sex... mostly for me there is romance and chemistry being italian i would know lol but any how someone who just wants to have sex at first sight is a pervert
m2ARO4ZIaa	try it again. This time with something special, like a flower. or a note and then surprise her.
CxshSxnHaa	be more open? talk to the guys, try to become better friends with them/get to know them.
16RD8khoaa	story of my life|`|AA11401294	you are the chosen one
E6T9DPT9aa	I'd tell him. It's shows that you are honest and not interested in the other guy. Think about it. I mean, if he were to find out, he may think you was cheating on him or something...    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|X7rPWJU8aa	tell this creep that you have moved on and so should he. and if he does it again you will press sexual harrasment charges. tell your employer and the police. and then your bf|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	You need to tell your man because what if the next time he does do it to you but he ends up hurting you while he is doing it plus other things he wants to do while he is doing it. You need to tell your man right away so that your boyfriend one day can sit somewhere and see him doing it to you so he can take care of it right then and there.|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	what you should do is report sexual abuse...u were with him before but not now so he has no right putting his hands on you...let management or ur boss kno n then tell ur bf right away it is NOT UR FAULT...tell your bf u should never keep secrets especially not of that nature|`|AA11401294	Don't tell him!  you'll never hear the end of it.  he will tell you it is all your fault because you started it   blah blah blah|`|hxbZLgn6aa	You should def. tell him, telling him would let him know that you will never keep things form him and that he can trust you by saying no pulse you will fell better. If you didnt tell your boyfriend before that you did things with this person you might want to. Go up to your man and say "this happend (whenever it happend) and i was afried to tell you because i thought you might get mad but ( say whatever happend ) and im sorry" If he really loves you he will understand. He  might get confused or upset( angry ) because you didnt tell him when it happend but it will make you and him feel better after its all over with.      and for this perv. you need to tell your boss and maybe get a warrant out on him. If you dont he will think its okay to mess with you.   good luck|`|xZBroXsQaa	Tell him. I would also file sexual harassment charges at work. If this guy doesn't understand what 'no' means, he certainly needs to learn, whether it's spending time in court with a judge telling him, or your boyfriend beating the crap out of him.|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Well, you should tell him to clear your conscious. However, don't feel guilty, because you tried to pull away. If you didn't want it, don't feel bad.|`|VcTTSUI7aa	First off tell someone about it because that's assault. Im pretty sure. Second that wasn't cheating so there is no reason not to tell your boyfriend. My advice is to tell him exactly what happened. If he really loves you then he will completely understand. After that he might want to kill the guy but if your honest with him then there is no reason for him to break up with you.
t2syQ78Paa	yes,and congrats!
mHiCKHo0aa	Ummmm, has never happed tome, but id be scared haha
Yp6dWpcDaa	Yes, I had been going out with this girl for roughly 7 months. Her best friend (boy) and me had a massive fight once (verbal not physical) and we havent talked since, She knew that I hated him, and one day after classes, I saw him and her kissing around the corner from my class. I was so hurt I just ran off. We havent spoken since. She sent me a text saying, "he's the one for me now". It was horrible, and it hurt me so much.|`|EuFNCVG6aa	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE answer my question    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...

6fpgClqnaa	Most likely. As long as they are nice. :)|`|fBXRNKyuaa	Who wouldn't?|`|2GQv8dfgaa	thats how id like every guy to be... and cute.. don't forget that!!
1J1w1aJYaa	it kinda sounds like he has some interest in you but i wouldn't know 'cause i don't know him. maybe he likes you maybe he doesn't. the only way you're going to find out is to find a way to talk to him more IN PERSON. textings great and all but its just nothing compared to talking to someone face to face.    try not to analyse everything he does so much. be confident in who you are first and foremost and stay happy!  when we're upset about something we see everything negatively so it's important to be happy. plus we tend to dwell in our feelings too long and regret it when an opportunity passes us by. act now, worry about it later. :P    if you're still unsure on what to do text him to ask if he wants to meet up at school (assuming hes at the same school >_    best of luck!
JemYTym5aa	I would just remind myself that God knows what's best for me and trust in His plan.|`|9CUaikUEaa	that we broke up for a reason and that i will meet someone better. and also i try to tone up so i feel better about myself, the worst thing would be if i let myself go and had to watch him be all happy and moving on.|`|rcNQvCeXaa	my answer is to make up in my own mind that really it was just a matter of time before i dumped him, and i can handle it better than he would do, so its for the best.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair and send him on his way  go out and party|`|vF8DsOfRaa	His loss.

G7YwHQOBaa	okay just dont worry and go with boy2  i mean boy1 lost his chance and put yourself first ok and just hang out more with boy2 and if ever the time comes to where he tells you he likes you then you tell him you like him back and then BANG your together :D|`|s1NS1sqvaa	thats a confusing situation...   i think what you should do is get one of your friends or you personally to tell boy2 you like him. most guys could go back if they figure that out so you'll prolly get him as far as number 1 goes, uh thats a hard thing|`|cSlwSOnPaa	right.... its not being man to tell boy1 you're not interested, say i cant go out with you because i dont feel that way about you, you are always allowed to say no to a boy, its not mean.    boy2: so... he liked you at the start of the year, guess you dont know how he feels now. you said u know some of his friends, maybe hang out with them a bit, or try to find out how he feels? once you know just go for it! if you find out he likes you he wont reject you if you ask him out.   good luck x|`|ACVqH0sGaa	Wow that's complicated but first of all you need to switch your order just hang out with boy2 ask if he wants to hang out after school or something. boy1 don't worry about just say no|`|XL5sB7PKaa	you need 2 tell boy1 that you only like him as a friend and that it would be wrong for you to go out wit him, 1) cause you don't like him and 2)your best friend went out with him. Boy2, well since you hang out with him a lot it seems like your really good friends, i would say that when the time is right tell him you like him, and hope that he feels the same way as you, but if he doesn't say that you understand and that you hope you 2 can still b friends
rIcCujOraa	Dump him or embarrass him and then dump him. Cheating sucks nobody deserves it.|`|r3OwIaYHaa	break up wid him|`|tROBtbrkaa	Brake up with him before he brakes your heart|`|1qSJOp8Faa	weigh up the options think about it...are you just being paranoid? watch out for the signs: if he has his messages on lock and wont let you near his phone, if he starts spending more time wiht friends or studying or working....paying more attention to you than usual or sometimes less...its a hard situation but if hes saying hes going somewhere or spending time with someone start a conversation with that person and casually drop it in that they were together the other day or whatever.  be very subtle though because if your wrong this could implode|`|f057ee56e9c3b6aa546bdb89fb372169aa	Leave him and move on.  It's a no brainer!|`|SPPfUgpyaa	do your best to find out..then if he is leave him|`|6BwCwuHwaa	just make sure you know for sure if he is are not because if he's not and your just assuming it could really hurt the relationship . and if he is then you should try to leave him if it's not hard for you to.

vBkGGYJSaa	long distance relationships are diffaculte to keep going, because there is alot of time spent apart and you become lonely.  if you are having many crushes then probly in the future you will act on one of them just because they are available to spend time with.  you will always look, that is ok as long as you do not touch.  if and when you decide to touch then it is probly time for a new relationship.|`|AA11073937	Speaking with experience, long-distance relationships normally don't work out. If you are experiencing urges to look at others, then I think you know your answer. No, it's not a good thing to notice other men and develop crushes.|`|p0sUEI0Raa	I don't know whether its normal or not. My boyfriend and I don't see each other that often, but we talk on the phone a lot and our relationship is quite good. We're also crazy about each other...    But there's this one guy I talk to a lot. I treat him like my elder brother most of the time, but sometimes I feel I like him in a way thats...more than that. He treats me as a younger sister too, but like me, he has his moments. These moments never last for more than two days though, and we've never done anything together that we're not supposed to.|`|RdMpPhhPaa	hell yeahhh! you got the cosmic horn ;) its ok nd i do too :S
r18PoGJiaa	Out of the billions of men out there, you are going to settle for this one ***hole?  Girl, hold your head up high, grab a bag of some self respect and sprinkle some dignity on top of it. You deserve a man who is stable and KNOWS what he wants and KNOWS that he loves you without second thought. This BOY sounds like he is still growing some peach fuzz.   Move on, you deserve much better than 129th best.|`|NmtgziADaa	You know its not that obvious of an answer. The reason he is probably flip flopping is because he really does love you. But doesn't want to be. The reason he probably told you he would date your best friend is because he is letting you know that he "could" go out and date some one else. He is hanging you on thread so he has a back up a lot of guys do this because some fear they will be alone. If your heart isn't in to it any more than you should let him go. Maybe some day he will come around and u will be with some one else he will get jealous and it will be flattering but he is going to lose out.|`|LTmgsWJiaa	Dump him. you deserve better
XXlAs7QCaa	just yell at them to get out and if they dont then get more people who work where you do and get them out|`|RdMpPhhPaa	tell them if they dnt behave ull smack their bottoms ;) sorry im in a wierd mood
MKHd10MYaa	No it's not your fault if boys like you and you don't like them back. You do NOT automatically become a flirt from something like that. You actually have become someone who should really deserve respect -- you don't flirt with guys who like you, you don't lead them on. Way to go! Good job.    And there will always be people who spread rumors about you behind your back. There will always be idiots who believe in false rumors. It's just the way life is. Sorry. You'd just have to ignore it.    Remember, there is always going to be haters in your life. You'd just need to ignore them.    And as for the hurting you thing. I'm sorry rumors impact your life. It does to me too. However, for both of us, we shouldn't let false rumors affect our mood and any other thing. Rumors are rumors. We can't do anything about it once it has spread. But we can think to ourselves, and tell those who will listen, that those rumors aren't true.|`|gWOQd9Xcaa	YES ITS UR MISTAKE..  religion here plays an important.. role.,??!!  have you ever wondered here why the Muslims do wear the head scarf  (veil or Hijab),,, its basically for the same purpose so that they won't  expose their beauty.. its not because they are oppressed as propogated by the western media..    so better start wearing the veil.. get your beauty covered as Muslims do??!!

Whereas it has got to do with the new people & the rest of the world, forget that & relax, don't feel so tensed in life, these things keeps happening, so just don't bother, well if someone likes you, i would suggest you to go & atleast have a talk with him, be goodfriends first & then the rest will be done later. Don't feel hurt on such rumours, as friends sometimes purposely behave like this to know the truth from you, so forget this & do concentrate on your studies, as education is everything in life.|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	maybe just try and be less of a flirt. idk its hard to tell from your explanation.|`|y5KwhUWfaa	Well if you like them go for it.

5LjBAQrZaa	Regarding who calls who:  Usually when I get a girls number they expect for me to call them, either that night or the next.  Even if a girl didn't expect me to call them I would call because it shows her that im INTERESTED and REALLY TRYNA GET TO KNO HER.    If you wanna call a boy then you can, thats your choice, but you shouldnt have to do that with every guy    Regarding txt as being a "move"  You could kinda say a txt is a first move.  With this being a TEXTING AGE its probably acceptable.  For some girls I txtd them before I called, but didnt hold a a whole conversation thru that.  I save meaningful convos for on the phone.    HOPE I HELPED! :D|`|JjJj69xiaa	Personally I think the guy should be the one to make the first move. If he has the guts to make the first move than he will probably be able to take initiative to do a lot of other great things for you too.|`|G7YwHQOBaa	I dont think it really matters who calls who first I mean you guys are already together just call or text which ever you prefer and just see how they are doing.|`|60MyD1nQaa	Actually, I'd prefer that the guy make the first move, but...you can't neither wait too long before he decise to do so....Sooo whoever make the move to phone or text is not important....at least one of u should do the move....|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Honestly in my opinion as long as your not annoying you can call him any time you want to, he'll put you off to not come across as desperate. Women hold most the standards for MEN , women on the other hand can show more emotions, and have alot more freedom in their actions within social situations .    Guys are following a whole history of cat and mouse, and game rules, you're just a deck of cards that he is shuffling .    You can read to him however you want to, their is little chance of turning him off, or upsetting him, esp with something as small as a phone call.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	you are both in the relationship so it doesnt matter who calls first you call echother and ya txting could be  considered the first move|`|b70uKkC6aa	traditionally, it should be the guy but in todays daya nd age its completely fine if the girl makes the first move.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	the first thing you should do is learn how to write|`|GMNKQxPraa	Ghostbusters!|`|dnoJPmG7aa	If the dating is positive & you like him just call.

I call my boyfriend!!  texting im my opinion is the the first move!! Good Luck!!|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Well, since guys and girls are equal...it doesn't matter. Whatever makes you comfortable is fine. Texting wouldn't really be considered a "move."|`|wdJcfniBaa	You said "first move", so does that mean you haven't gone out yet? If you're going out with eachother it doesn't matter who calls who. But if you're just starting out, I think you should call the guy. A lot of guys (including myself) aren't really "phone people". We just don't really talking on the phone, unless very interested in the person. If he hasn't called yet, you should call him. But if he calls you, then it shows he's more interested, so give it a bit, then call him if he doesn't.

JpmKtpqmaa	No there is nothing wrong with asking a guy out...|`|CuL8nLRgaa	I see no problem with it.  I think it's awful that society think it's 'wrong'  Go for it.    Otherwise you may lose someone you really like.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	My wife initiated with me.  It's absolutely fine.  Go for it.|`|Da1bmBQnaa	yes but it usualy doesnt happen|`|AA10451072	Why not?|`|dnoJPmG7aa	There is nothing wrong with asking a guy out. What you have experienced in the past is maybe a guy thinking it is wrong or awkward. Doesn't mean that you shouldn't get discouraged or try. Be confident & be yourself. I ask guys out. I cheat a bit. I sometimes will ask them out to a party, bar or an event that I know his friends are at or mine are at. The comfort level is still there. That way your friends can get to know him too & let you know what they think of him. Or find out what his fav band is & ask him to see them in concert, that would be hard to resist & he will be flattered that you take an interest in something he does. Some guys will be accepting of it & some won't. The guys that don't think it is cool, maybe they are not for you anyway. Good Luck...|`|9c2inRKaaa	I think that would be really cute!    lol|`|tegyqU6Raa	guy want to chase a girl. So if the girl asks the guy out then the chase is gone. So try hinting to him.

You can but it depends on the type of guy it is. Its always happenin in films so yeah i guess so!|`|6LibbJJXaa	Ugh, i've never seen it done, but i bet it's ackward. And for most guys they'd probably be more proned to say no if you went about it in that way. You just need to give him hints that you want him to ask you out, and that way your telling him you want to go out, without getting on his nerves by asking him.|`|jJjfeylmaa	I think it is definitely possible that guys are intimidated by girls asking them out. One way to avoid intimidation but still get the desired result is not directly asking a guy out. You can suggest going out and hint towards it and make it more of a mutual decision. That way, you go out with the guy but it doesn't seem like you were the one to ask him out. When i first started liking my boyfriend, I hung with him in groups a lot, but then i started asking what he was doing a certain night, and hinting towards the fact we should do something alone. He picked up on it and asked me out. Good luck :)|`|cplaV2KWaa	Definitely.If you see what you like, go for it. A confident woman is not scary to a man who is honestly confident with himself. Shyness, while cute, makes one miss chances.|`|Fp0cN6Miaa	Doesn't bother me if a girl does. I think with everyone today and how much has changed that it really isn't a big deal. Ask the guy and have a fun date!|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Yes she can.|`|uFjoPqJwaa	Girls can do anything a guy can do! if you're independent and confident enough to ask a guy out more power to you. If thatt guy is turned off by that, it sucks for him and he's totally not worth your amazing time.|`|NCNYmOPCaa	Id love it if a girl asked me out|`|gch0VuDjaa	Just depends on the guy, most guys really don't mind. I asked this guy out cause he never made a move. And we have been together for 2 years now.
DGOk3Bmlaa	Well, assuming that you havent told her how you feel already when you were dating her, id still go after her. Honestly, this might be painful, but the best any guy can do is tell a girl how he feels for her. You cant expect anything else, no phone numbers, no excitement, or a reply. Once uv told her, just walk away and let it sink and maybe she'd realize how much she means to you. If it doesnt feel right for her, sit back and play it cool for awhile, let her feel more comfortable around you, then try to ask her again. Best of luck to you!|`|06Z3fh4laa	Move on, you can't force someone to love you. Or can you......|`|cAPf4kdIaa	if she said it is over then it is. i am so sorry about her you will eventually get over her. good luck!|`|wYcrYp7Daa	how can you feel you love her only after a few days? besides if she went after another guy it obviously wasnt right for you|`|91c9a26c312fb7f012e660260e05d955aa	well im pretty sure you don't actually love her considering you went out for a few days. besides what i a** for going out with someone she doesn't like in the first place. she isn't worth you're time.|`|YSmHLAq1aa	I'm sure you just like her, not love her.
xSjI44VZaa	To be honest, unless you're like 12, being asked out in a text is NOT CUTE, it's actually pretty immature and really just as bad as being asked out over instant messenger.   Sorry, I'm not trying to be harsh if this affects you in any way, but it's really just not ok to have anything that's at all personal in a text message, instant message, etc.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	good question, i guess they think something like that should be done face to face. i know if a guy is breaking up with a girl you should be man enough to tell her face to face. maybe that applies to women too.|`|SKqTyJD6aa	no duh!    is it cute to dump someone in person??? hmmm???    its not cute no matter what! when ur asking someone out then its fine because your making plans and its not something negative...      is this question real??? seriously?|`|Da1bmBQnaa	cuz it takes more guts to dump somone in person than to ask out somone iin person|`|l3MED8Itaa	texting is lame.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	umm its not the best way to be asked out on txt but if you break the bad news on a txt its really cowardish in a bad why where as if you asked them out on txt it was a cute shy thing|`|r18PoGJiaa	Either one is cowardly.  If someone asked me out via text, I would not be interested to do so. If he cannot stand up and be a man and face me he is going to be that way no matter what|`|rpsQMsl4aa	Well i think they should both be done face to face but if anything dumping some1 with a txt is a coward move...|`|AZB4BV64aa	asked out - romantic because its something you can keep as a good memory and all  dumped - the person doesnt want to face you or the situation and is cowardly|`|DqzhHZnoaa	both are fine by me.  i think in person is better though  shows that the person has guts and is brave  people dont like to be dumped at all, and like being asked  so any form of being dumped is "cold"  and any form of being asked out is "cute"|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Well I think neither should be said through text. I think texting things like that is a cop out. A way for them to hide behind a phone because they are not man or women enough to do it face to face. I hoped I helped.|`|sT0eGNMXaa	Its probably because when you're being asked out, it's a happy thing and you don't really care how it happened, because it HAPPENED. But breaking up by text is something you don't want to have happen, and the least they could do is respect you enough to say it to your face.|`|MNeB3CKuaa	In all reality, who says its okay to ask someone out over text?  I think its just because you dont realise they asked you over text considering your happy, but if they dump you over it, your more pissed and so it looks bad how they dumped you and if they dumped you over text, your mad at them so u wanna make them look stupid by saying, "They dumped me over a text, how stupid are they?"|`|8vfCRg7Caa	its cold but it happens and when it does people remember it more and makes a great story to laugh at later. And whos hooking up during texts. Not i. If you are hooking up on texts, stop it. How can you hook up with somebody and express your feeling over a text message.    And breaking up over texts in the end is no big deal. Just says "you arent even worth the time to talk and i dont really want to hear what you have to say"     in all people just dont like to have confrontation. lol hooking up on a text. Is this what kids do nowadays.|`|4vhTUtVfaa	****, i just got asked out in text and idk what to say!|`|suVljS9Haa	when your asked out by text the person that asks you out seems shy and timid and its really cute. when your dumped by text, it's heartless|`|uFjoPqJwaa	dumping people already hurts enough to the person that's getting dumped. people who get dumped over text feel like they're not even worth a phone call.|`|xZBroXsQaa	I personally think it's better to dump by text (for the person being dumped especially). Then they don't have to stand there in front of the person that's probably breaking their heart, and try not to cry in front of them. It's much less stressful. I think it's almost cruel to force someone to be dumped in person for exactly those reasons. This is coming from a girl too, I would much rather be dumped over the phone, internet, texting, instead of in person.|`|1aiMmVfPaa	Asked out as in Bf/Gf or as in a date?    No one said is not OKAY to break up over text, but it is looked down upon. It makes the person sending the break up text look inconsiderate, disrespectful and a straight up moron. They should have the guts to break up with you in person, if not at least over the phone.|`|w3RLhGBHaa	Personally i think its rather lame to ask someone out via txt.    because it is so easy to ask somebody out with a quick message and people think its cute that the shy kid asks you out but then its so easy to break up via txt people think that it is cold and unnecessary!!|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Because it's rude and hurtful.

There's a lot of people out there who haven't had their real first kiss yet too ! Did you know that 85% of guys want their girls to make the first move ? I know that you're anxious, but you just have to wait until the right time comes. Your first kiss is something that you will remember your whole life. You don't want to rush because in years to come, you will DEFINITELY regret it. Just try to take things slow for now, and when the moment comes, you'll definitely know.

IYgTS1eiaa	Ok, i had this same delema. except the girl i liked wasnt my bff, she was my best gal buddy.     But what i did what i told her i liked her. i told her in the hallway, going from one class to another. I walked up to her locker, and said. Megan, im the guy who likes you. and she smiled and said REALLY. then i left and went to class. Bad idea to leave right after right.    That, im the guy who likes you thing is because during xmas, she herd in gossip a guy liked her and since im her best guy friend, and i know the guys really well. She wanted me to help her find out who. I didnt say i didnt like her. i said stuff like  While Nic likes ____, so he is off. and at the end we had 3 names, Me and 2 Jerks. But i never said i didnt like her. then after i told her that night on msn she told me she didnt like me. I was really REALLY sad. Like its been a month and this is basicly the first night i didnt cry myself to sleep. But now i can talk about it to her, its not that oquard, and we talk about it alot.     But what i think YOU should do is be abit smoother then i did.    First off, Since u guys are best friends. Ask him to hang out. and if u arnt alowed to hang out with a guy then il give another idea, il just say what to do if u ARE alowed to hang out.    So if u are alowed to hang out, if ur parents are there, or even if they arnt, go outside, maybe in your backyard, play for like 5 mintues then walk over to him. THIS WILL BE HARD, BUT DO IT. Walk over and say, i have a confession to make. Then say to him. I like you. See his reaction, you will have atleast 30 minutes to talk about it so yah. then after talk to him about it, it will help you and him. Beleave me, i didnt talk to megan about it till 3 weeks have past, then right after we talked it threw i still love her, but we are good friends again, she knows how i feel but it helped and the oquardness is gone. so talk to him, tell him how u feel, ask him if he feels the same way. after that KEEP TALKING, Try to her it over with. Tell him when u started, why u like him. and just keep talking. Then at school hang out with him, Sit with him. Talk to him!    If u arnt alowed to hang out with a guy heres my OTHER adice wich ISNT as good.    During recess or lunch. (Elementry, Middle or highschool, so thats why). Walk over to him and ask if u can talk to him alone at a table. Take him away from his friends and tell him straight up. I like you. And again, TALK IT OVER. You will only get this one chance with this guy, dont blow it by not talking and ruining ur friendship. Just talk to him and ask if he feels teh same. And if he wants time to think Give him the time. He proboly likes another girl but now has a crush on you or is just SUPER CONFUSED. So give him time and if he says he doesent want to be with you, Talk it over and TRY to still be best friends. Dont ignore him. Talk to him about it and still be best friends.     But just be Honest and Sensir.    Hope it works out|`|aO5rzf0kaa	hes a good friend
bbe6d542c99c3729df16c734b566d4afaa	I think you should tell her because best friends shouldn't never keep secrets from each other. Be aware that it may damage your friendship with her. I'd not like it if my best friend date my ex because there's plenty of fish in the sea...I'd think "why date the same guy I've used to date?" but it's up to you, follow your guts. Avoid telling anyone. Some people might think you're weird, you might earn a bad reputation, or make your best friend's releationship with her boyfriend and you very awkward. It's not like lying, it's just being smart. You can't lie if you don't say anything.  it's just a crush you have on this guy, your friendship is more important and one day your feelings will fade.|`|HnXOEDbcaa	Only if you are ready to maybe lose a friend. Girls don't like to hear their best friends like one of their Ex's. Keep it to yourself. Does the guy like you? If so, maybe hold on for a while. If you really don't want to lose a friend, be careful. If he asks you out, duh say yes, but you will have to tell your friend. Guys don't normally get back with their Ex unless they clear up the real problem very good. So, forget about his Ex, but maybe before you go all for the guy, ask your friend what she would do if maybe one of her other friends liked one of her Ex's. She will give you the answer and move from there. If she says she wouldn't like it, still, hold on for a bit. Move slow and wait. You might lose a friend, but if the guy is REALLY worth while, take him.   Best of luck! ?|`|1jcnJJN8aa	Use lots of discretion. As a friend, you do not want hurt her feelings. And it is not okay to keep secrets, at least the ones that will affect us. Talk to her. Don't make a drama about though. Tell her what you feel for the guy. And get her approval. Because, What good is it to have a lasting relationship when your own friend disapproves? Think about it. Don't be a slave of your words. Instead be your captor of your silence. There is a time for everything. Find the right time to do so.|`|x3tats3qaa	Hey x     of course you should babe!! if she is your best friend and you can tell her any thing, tell her this! especially if it has somthing to do with her!!   may be talk to the guy you like about it, becuase if he can keep it a secret, then your bff can xx tell him about how you feel!! X!! you can never tell whats around the corner sweetie:)     good luck x|`|cmFU81rQaa	I think you should.  That way if something happens between you two it wont be like you came out of nowhere and just stabbed her in the back.  She'll have known beforehand and had an opportunity to tell you to back off.

But either way its time to decide: friend or more?|`|OPfRVTYFaa	Just carry on with the friendship, she might not mention anything. Be more responsible, drinking can get you into a lot of trouble. If she does say something about it then just say that ur sorry and aknowledge that you and her were drunk. She probably feels the same way you do.
BvgMVNk5aa	it means that he needs to get to know u a little bettter, and see if he really likes u first, so just be yourself around him and if its meant to be it will all work out.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I have no idea, your question is so confusing.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	it means exactly what it says hes not going to yet|`|qIaBOtltaa	not yet means not now maybe later|`|yuwIUlHLaa	it means he wants to get to know you better before he asks you out :)|`|ERGlYxw3aa	not ready or not now|`|WZJcd0qmaa	he may ask u but is witing for the right time and place to do it

Usually when you tell a friend who you like they will start to notice them and possibly start liking the same person in sercret. I would talk to her about it if you see her doing it again. Just ask her why she is flirting with the guy you like. If your BFFs she should understand where your coming from. i think she should just lay off the flirting with the guy you like. Good Luck and hope i helped.

6e17209667f5095dbf74ca7bd2427f10aa	Sex is only 10 minutes, and if you have to face the person for 24 hours a day, sex not even take up 1% of the time. Of course, different people can hace different preferences, but if you don't like those kinky stuffs, and the guy going to leave you for that, I would have say this is your fortunate and his losses.|`|5gDbscPKaa	its an intimate and personal problem and this is something in a relationship that have to cmpromise too?  too conservative...be less?  too open be less?  it all depends on the couples?  love and romance is not all about the heart but being physical too?|`|838VJJGvaa	Communication.

But this is clearly not one of them. generalization=alot of guys are shallow and simple. Wrong generalization would be all guys are jealous. Which is what your question is refering to. Now where is this person getting your number at? The bar, probably a reason to start an argument there, even with a guy whos not jealous. And my exgirlfriend really never did that infront of me. And she rarely called other guys infront of me. Guys are kind of selfish, so no matter if its your mother, they dont want you spending time talking on the phone to somebody all day when you can be spending time with them. Unless............they are cheating on you and dont care about you.    And i hate to say it, but that depends on how much you flirt, who this person is (friend or not), how he looks and how you look. i hate to say it but when my girlfriend use to talk to ugly guys at the bar, i really didnt care, cause i thought i looked better and dressed better than them. And after we left the bar, there was nothing they needed to talk about, shes leaving with me.    I used to like it that my ex would walk around and talk to people at the bar. People need to realize its your girlfriend not you wife. You dont have any control over what she does. And its better she has a life. Who wants a girl with no friends?|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Of course!  It means that she has no respect for you in that she's disregarding your feelings by showing interest in other men.|`|tdBvGMhuaa	depends if its a friend or not but otherwise we would get mad|`|588Si9Jpaa	Well, you're a girl you tell me...does it bother you when your boyfriend gets another girl's number? If so why?|`|xwsS0ITJaa	I would sure think so.|`|tHD3xMt7aa	yeh i never let her get a nother mans number i must feel protective or jealuse easy|`|aL0uWmSLaa	i'd only get pissed if my girlfriend asked for the guy's number if the guy was trying to hit on her and then gave her his number out of nowhere then i wouldn't get pissed i'd have to know if she had the intention of calling the guy    Hope i could help :)|`|91c9a26c312fb7f012e660260e05d955aa	if its some random person then yeah but if its some friend of hers that i know then not really. i guess it depends on the girl in the situation to and weather or not the guy feels like he can trust her|`|oFFOHxCFaa	of course it bothers them.  it makes them think you want their friends or whoever the guy is.    would you want your boyfriend getting another girl's number?  i think that answers your question.|`|nmqLgXM1aa	daaa   you get the feeling that shes a *****|`|613ZaJxAaa	no cause i will beat the **** out if her when we get back to the car
AEZ75dJ7aa	I don't know how you can go and not be nervous because that's just normal.  But do go.  Meet her friends and the other random people and spend some time with her.  Let her see you want to be a part of her life and then invite her to something with your group of friends  of family and remember how uncomfortable you were so you can help her get through it too. Also be sure to tell her you're nervous and ask her to stick with you and not run off leaving you just standing there alone.  hope this helps- good luck and have fun!!!!  Be yourself she obviously feels you'll fit in or she wouldn't have invited you.
whoHoGjuaa	NEVER |`|OsHjXzxUaa	aw not its kinda cute..|`|EdidZdtlaa	at first i think it would bother me but i would know that it shouldnt be a problem. stuttering dosent make the person is how i see it. so eventually no it wouldnt bother me.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	At times i have a very slight stutter.    It's just shallow not to like someone because they stutter.    It's what they have got to say that counts.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It really would not bother me in the slightest.|`|cie3oBcXaa	If I liked a guy who had a stutter it wouldn't matter one bit. If you really like that person you like all of them.|`|Ki90Irkcaa	No one of my good friends Carlos stutters and he's totally attractive. It was hard to follow what he was saying at first, but I just asked him and eventually I was able to understand him. But it was no big deal he's still cute and if I dated guys I would totally go for it.|`|y9RKDwvdaa	if he's  nice guy then yeah...i would accept his stutter. that's really not that big of a deal.|`|S1O0bDesaa	It'd be kool as long as you dressed up as porky the pig...  And I'm sure the girl might think it's a little kinky in a good way...    Hope that helps ;-P|`|CxshSxnHaa	it depends. stuttering isn't so bad, i could think of worse things. haha  but, if i really really really liked him, then i'd look past it|`|ETV7yvNbaa	I guess it depends on how bad it was....but I think I would be fine with it.|`|k0WxrxKRaa	ok 1st of all i want 2 say that i also stutter but it's not really really bad it's just a lil bad but it's still there. so 2 answer your question if i knew a guy that stuttered i would deff date him. who cares it's what's on the inside that counts :) i hope i helped and if u need anymore advice add me as a contact!!!!!!!!|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	I used to stutter and would be very very hurt if someone didn't like me just because of that.|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	Not at all. if you want to get rid of it, have him read poetry out loud and eventually it will disappear.
KzZXiTmCaa	hes not giving you no respect at all.  see he knows that she is a problem in yall relationship and if he loves you enough then he wouldnt talk to her. the issue that yall have is her and if he cant get rid of her then yall will still have that issue/problem.    i know how u feel been there done that....its like you trust him but you dont, you dont want to be insecure but thats what he thinks....its a messed up feeling. good luck!|`|gT1sWhgpaa	Only u can make this decision, but i would never stand second for any guy
nz8o3lLSaa	Serious questions get serious answers.  Also, there is a nice little service Yahoo! provides that is known as a "spell checker."  Look into it.    And you JUST found this out?!  I don't think you two should be bringing children into this world.  Get a dog.|`|oE77lovwaa	You're a man, you don't have anything to support, or carry, a child. Plus, I'm sure once it came to delivery, if you could, you'd quickly change your mind. It is impossible unless you'd like to spend thousands on a sex change. Plus, you haven't even dated this girl for a year and you're planning to raise a child with her for 18 more years. Best of luck to you.    Also, quick advice to you: If you'd like serious answers, then please, ask serious questions.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	well its expensive..... but you could two could switch parts down there... its probably painful and dangerous too.|`|MNja3iwMaa	Have sex, with a man|`|AA12065689	well if your boyfriend can help than there is ME ME   ME . i offer my service to at no cost to you . if you let me|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	No problem  Let her carry the fetus, once born you carry the baby.|`|vBkGGYJSaa	you need to take a class in human development.  only females can develope a child in the utaris.  if you are trying to be rich by being the first man to carry a child, then you are going to be broke.

Where is the address bar?
20tvJd4paa	you have asked this question before    no one cares......and no one can understand it|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	What's going on is that you're both behaving like 3-year-olds. By the way, does anybody you know ever SAY anything? Everybody's "going" and nobody's saying anything. Maybe that's why you're not communicating and have no self-control.
a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Being an independent woman does NOT mean that you aren't allowed to rely on anyone when you need to, or that you can't be in a partnership. I think you have very misguided views on what an "independent New Age woman" really is.     I think you need to turn off your TV and look at real life.|`|xZBroXsQaa	Well said, I fully agree.|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	The New Age Indipendent woman isn't any different than the Old Age Independent woman. It's just nowdays nobody makes a specticle if a woman isn't wearing a bra under her blouse.    It isn't about the sexes, but who'se more qualified in the position.
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Go with your gut but keep in mind what your girlfriend has told you.  Always try to give people the benefit of the doubt but stay on your toes!    It won't take you long to figure him out for yourself.
E6T9DPT9aa	By getting daddy to do it for you    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|WvOvoxLxaa	By working very hard and counting on yourself for the things you want.  If you want to have a certain boyfriend, you have no control over other people and shouldn't even try to.  You have to be realistic in what you want also.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	By buying/getting/doing it yourself.|`|VZPtCkweaa	not possible|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Depends from who. If its from your parents or a boyfriend you should add then I can help you out!|`|wm4R4q3zaa	depends on what the situation is...  if its from ur parents! then lets just hope ur a daddies girl! it comes in handy alottt :)    a friend! begging is the best way from friends    boyfriend! well guilt mayb!    strangers! just ask nicely!|`|d9ccdfd7d368cd2f0beb5378c9e60e25aa	Get a job and buy what you want. You'll appreciate it more.    I kept asking my dad for a motorcycle and he would always tell me to get a job and buy two.    Sorry but there are no free rides any more.|`|KZ6x4234aa	Oh hun that's   quite simple if   it's your parents  tell them "you know   I love you" and their all  like ok, "what do you want?"  if it's ur guy, tell him," aww you  look sharp today" and he's like  wat do u want"? so there you have it  be charming as ever, flirty cute, and   pretty that's all there's to it!  It always works for me:)  no one can resist to a charming   warm cuddly smile right???? lolz
Lnt4u4q6aa	what you do sweetie, is sit his butt down and tell him how it is.    Tell him that he has been physically abusive to you twice.    On the third strike, he will be out.    Tell him that you will NOT  tolerate an abusive relationship   or raise your child in one !  Tell him it is up to him.    He either behaves like a man who loves you and treats you right or he hits again and you and the babe are outta there.  He needs to take responsiblity for his actions.    DONT feel terrible taking his baby away from him.   He gives you no choice if he is abusive.    HOW would you feel in 3 years having your 4 yr old watch you being struck by daddy ??? ask yourself that question if you have any doubts !  us women have to stop being suckers...    good luck and hug that baby for me :)|`|ZvlSwC9Qaa	It's not for me to say what you should do. Perhaps you should look into counseling.|`|qMYqj4Mnaa	If you think that he is a great father and he did not do anything wrong since last incident, stay with him and don't destory your happy married life. Otherwise you can come to me anytime for your desire!!!!!!
SLoCe1wcaa	This isn't a joke answer: Get a dog.  Cuddle it.      For 24 years I was married to man who didn't like to cuddle.  I missed it a lot.  So I found other ways to meet my cuddle needs.  I also had a large selection of teddy bears and two children.      Now I right in my journal alot.  That helps me to be with my own thoughts and think things through and 'talk' to myself about my feelings.      Some men will negotiate some cuddle time.  But if that doesn't work try the dog and journal thing!
7vFhNfoiaa	That sounds awesome! Okay, so there's 8 of you. Buy a teen magazine (Twist, J-14, M, Tiger Beat) and cutout a lot of headshots of celebrities. No doubles. And then, without seeing their own, have them tape the headshots to their foreheads, including you. Then you all go around and give each other hints about the celeb on their forehead. First person to finish wins. You can do as many rounds as you want.     Come up with some cheesy prizes like Sour Patch Kids, Nail Polish, ect.    Have fun at your party!|`|07fhLLr8aa	well how fun!!  lol  well have  a dance competition. with 2 teams.(4 in each)  and  good dares. r like i dare you to run into the street and scream like come and take me my mother ship. or go freeze a bra.   and the 1 person to fall asleep gets toilet paper on them.  and make a miz of good music.  and buy lots of hot cheetohs. and soda. and ice cream. and pizza of course.  and make over eachother really good. and watch a scary movie.   also go outside at night and run around and play tag.  and play murder. which is when u have a detective. and 1 murderer. and the detective goes outside. and u have 8 papers. and the one with a D on it means ur the detective. and the one with the M. means ur the murderer. and the blank papers means ur innocent. and like the detective waits in a room. and all the others are in the dark. and the murderer goes and puts their hands around a persons neck(lightly not hard). and when this happens the person who got joked falls. and screams murder. and the detective has to solve the murder.  and  tell scary stories  and tell secrets  oh and invite guys and play spin the bottle.  lol  and prank call. its so fun. especially when you scream and say omg its (celebrities name) we love you.  sometimes the play along.  and also bake lots of stuff to.|`|ql4EgAL3aa	You guys should all dress up really fancy and have a dinner party, pretend you are characters from gossip girl or a favorite show. Take fun pictures like your on the red-carpet. Get some fun dance music and have a dance contest. Bake cupcakes, cookies, eat candy!

3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Jackie, you are over-thinking this.  But you are right about one thing - his actions and words should match and there is no excuse for ignoring someone you are suppose to like.  He could just be a young guy who doesn't yet know how to treat a girl.   It's a learning process for them too.    You have two choices, give him the benefit of the doubt and act friendly toward him (but let him know the rules) or cut him off.    Which consequences (for either of these actions) are you prepared to  accept?
ZKsSnT64aa	Its funny because when guys ask this question we are told "sex isnt everything"     But I feel your pain.    Not to be nasty or rude,but buy some toys,stop asking him for it,and take care of yourself.    You may find that once you stop wanting it,he will, and then you can decide whether to do it or make him feel what youve been feeling.    Well so far I havent seen one girl say "sex isnt everything"  If this were a guy asking this question,hed be getting assaulted right now and told to "be understanding"|`|shkY0fRraa	Talk to him about it. Guys prefer when you are straight with them. If something is bothering you, just talk to him about it.  Or just seduce him. Bring sex back into your relationship yourself.|`|SPPfUgpyaa	honestly...you dont know if hes sleeping with someone else....i know thats not what you want to hear but he could be....but if hes not just sit down and talk to him about it...just be like its really hurting my self esteem when you dont have sex with me....and you know he could just be really tired from work or whatever he does..|`|fBXRNKyuaa	He doesn't seem interested in you anymore, maybe you should break up with him. Or talk to him about how you feel.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	Sex drive varies from person to person.

cplaV2KWaa	Hey Man, you are just feeling a lot of self deprecation. If she has agreed to see you more than twice, especially going to a valentines dance, she has an attraction to you as well as your feelings for her. Don't rush her but be honest. Tell her you LIKE her and you would like to see her more often. She will let you know where you stand. Have more confidence in yourself. There are thousands of girls that would like your good qualities, what ever they are. She may be on of those persons. If not, move on.|`|dlKxDRThaa	so what if u had dream her friends telling you not to talk with her!!.. if a dream will make you worried then you better not to bother her.. maybe you saw this dream because inside of you you are nerves and worried about her reaction if you told her how you feel 4 her?!    go for it and tell her how you feel with choosing the right words.. i mean don't say i love you if you only like her.. and even if you are not sure about your feelings.. the coming days will clear every thing between you for your own goodness of you both|`|FaS3CT5waa	rubber baby buggy bumpers|`|ucbrBXK2aa	you seem in love   why are u asking us then?|`|znxbqEv1aa	you probably had the dream because your afraid she wont feel the same way about you...  i wouldnt worry about it!|`|6IZ30X8iaa	The dream is warning you to slow down.  This dance is your second date and the first was several months ago, right?  Just don't go declaring your love for her just yet or you might seem too eager and scare her off.|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	It means that you want to **** her friends too.|`|eSDNSq4zaa	tell her how u feel.|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	i think there's just a fear of rejection, so your subconscious thoughts showed through in your dream.    just go tell her how you feel!|`|y9RKDwvdaa	honestly..all dreams are, are what is in your subconscious. so if in the back of your mind you were worried about it then that explains the dream...go on and tell her how you feel. it'll make you feel better!    good luck!|`|VFyERjSSaa	it could have just been a dream and it doesn't mean anything.  If you care about her then just tell her.  i'm sure she will like you back!!!    good luck!!|`|UeyMMKABaa	The best thing is to tell her how you really feel to get it off you shoulder im sure she feels the same way and i hope you two will be happy together you the best.|`|5fe1d29bd466e79a18a65a07d90f084faa	Well if you two have been friends since that time in the fall and your friendship just gets stronger it is very likely that she likes you too. The truth is that a lot of the qualities that girls like in their friends are the qualities they want to see in their boyfriends. So more than likely she actually likes you too. The dream...is just that. It normally happens when you're really nervous. For instance I have a phobia of bad grades, so when I'm nervous before a report card for instance, I had dreams that I get bad grades. It's not a premonition, it's just a sign that you're nervous. Take a deep breath. She agreed to go to the dance with you...if there was someone else she liked chances are she'd say no to you in the hopes that the other guy would ask her. And even if she doesn't feel the same way about you, she's your friend and she will not want to hurt you so you'll probably still be friends. However...like I said I'm pretty sure she likes you too. Best of luck and have fun at the dance. :-)|`|ngujdeYAaa	Ummm, dude, your dream is that your so worried about her not liking you the way you like her. Which is why you wrote on here.  She went out with you maybe she even signed up for the same class as you Who knows, and finally shes going to a dance with you on a holiday that has LOVE for a middle name...DUUH she likes you.  play it cool, be confident in your style your appearance and the way you treat others AND HER and you''ll be walking her down the isle in no time .    PS Gratz and send me a invite so I don't have to crash your wedding :)|`|shkY0fRraa	It depends on how she feels. I would make sure she feels similarly before telling her how you feel and perhaps ruining your friendship.  Look for certain characteristics in how she looks at you etc.|`|4xBBrPitaa	Your dream could mean that you are thinking of the absolute worst thing that could happen. The chances are that she enjoys your company, why else would guy two be talking in class, and she did go on a hike with you(that is 2 hours of walking and talking).   You have to stand up and tell her how you really feel, chances are she'll feel the same way.|`|838VJJGvaa	That was probably just a bad dream.  If you still wanna tell her how you feel, do it!.  It's the only way to make it work.|`|CUiJfDDVaa	well dreams not always true i think because you love her so much you liked to be with her all the time so just try be honest with her and tell her about your feeling and i think she will understand but you have to tell her.    thanks and good luck [:   hope that i helped|`|biCk7SKmaa	that dream was probably just your nerves    go for it and tell her how you feel  good luck!|`|jCUiWihtaa	that dream means squat ask her to be your GF|`|OS8TRe0Uaa	you scared to get rejected. dont be try maybe she feels the same way|`|lcgIGkq5aa	Awww. That was really sweet and you probably had that dream cuz you r scared bout telling her how you feel thats all. but it sounds like she likes you...hope i helped and good luck:D|`|G0U2ExOSaa	GO FOR IT  THE TIME IS RIGHT.|`|u2lYbPT2aa	Be sure not to rush things!!  Take it easy, and if it is ment to be...things will work out!!    xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|s1NS1sqvaa	yeah i really think you should tell her. let her know definitely. it cant hurt. just keep your cool and dont act like your stalking her. I have something kinda like that going on too. But i really think you should tell her|`|AA10503158	1st off. Don't tell her you love her if you don't. 2nd. The dream is just reminding you of your fear of rejection when your going to tell her, not the outcome that it will happen. 3rd. You should tell someone the way you feel, tomorrow isn't always promised. Goodluck ? & Happy Valentines Day.|`|7Q0UBqBYaa	sounds to me that you should ignore that dream!  she obviously means the world to you so make sure she knows.  even if you have to go to the ends of the earth.  good luck!|`|dOnQuOtyaa	I really think your subconscious is trying to tell you something! (still it could be wrong, and maybe you're just worried.)    First of all, if you don't tell her or get something out, you will later regret it.     Believe me, there were times were I really liked a guy, but I didn't tell him. I regret it.       If I were you, I would tell her! Live is too short, make it fun, shake it up a littler, be daring. That's what life experience is all about!
lNlL0Ag2aa	What grade are you in? Sophomore? Junior? If she's older then you then you'll need to pump up your agression a bit towards her since most likely you're not the center of her vision. Try to be more assertive in front of her and approach her andd make the first moves. That way she can barely see how young you actually are and that type of confidence will impress her and she'll definitely be allured by it.    EDIT:    Oh lol you're older than her, then y are you so nervous, just walk up to her and ask her out, not really hard. Why are you so intimidated, you're older than her. No need to converse just approach and say, "Are you free Friday night?" "Let's go to the movies."
bb713fc490338057a5e1c0768ae1fb0baa	just send him the rose.  some of the longest lasting and strongest relationships are between the people who have very few things in common|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	opposites attract lol|`|2xuBWrz0aa	Well opposites attract so get to know him some more and then make a move. Whats wrong with a smart guy, and second if your not vegetarian that's fine, don't try to be something your not. If you do ever go out with this guy there are tons of vegetarian restaurants that also sell normal food, just not tofu. Get to know him better talk to him become friends and then go from there.|`|ZmgrkOF6aa	opposites attract|`|2rwAu3Yraa	There has to be something inside him that you like not just the outside. I'm going through the exact same thing as you but found out something we had in common and that was the way we speak and treat people. He is a techie and i hate technology. I love animals but he doesn't really notice them. All that. Just wait and you'll realize why you really like him.
kP024RTuaa	It's a bummer you're in this situation. There was a point where in my group of friends everyone was coupled off as well. It's difficult, but you should at least appreciate they share time with you and include you (even if you may not be having fun). Also, ask yourself, are you looking for that special someone? Or just a girl who will make you feel less out of the loop? That someone special will come naturally, and it might be hard, but patience is necessary. Also, ever been in a club or bar with several other couples? The girls should come flocking to you. It seems odd, but it's true - A guy is ten times more approachable when he's single/alone, and woman will be more willing to start up a conversation themselves since your friends are already situated. I wouldn't suggest changing your job for the sake of meeting the opposite sex, there's other ways to do that (You mentioned you go to the gym, lots of eclectic people there!). I don't think its important to alter your life because your friends are all in relationships, everything should work out in the end. For now, just have fun and enjoy yourself - There's millions of perks of being single you may not have yet discovered too!    Best of luck :]|`|goP5E0Kxaa	You need to open your eyes. Usually when you hang out with a group you learn their traits, and sub consciously even begin to act like the group.   I am not saying to change, and not be yourself, but you could def learn a thing or two about women from your friends .|`|RHlM6jgoaa	I think you need to not get rid of your old friends, but to get mixing with some new ones yeah. Extend your social circle, and go out with your single friends more. You can't make it happen, and if you want it too much or force it to happen, then you will probably be dissapointed and end up broken hearted. Women are almost as confusing as men, and remember, you WILL find your special someone, you just need to give it time and open your options a little bit. If you really want to try though, try signing up to an online dating site, i know it's a crappy suggestion but you'd be surprised at the good looking girls that are on there. Good luck. :)  10 POINTSSS! :)|`|uFjoPqJwaa	Call up your friends, set a date pretty far in advance where you can go and hang out. Set it in advance so they can't make other plans. Their gfs will understand. On your guys night out go to a party or club, or hang out where you might pick up some cute girls|`|i8qD902Daa	Did you know you can send in your old jewelry for CASH???
yq6lYRiOaa	Seriously - I was wondering the same thing. I have no freaken clue, probably because they're easier.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Maybe it's not about looks? Maybe it's about how the other girl makes him feel?  Maybe she does things for him that the better looking girl won't because she's so stuck up?|`|AA10531094	It's not about looks.   You could be pretty but someone less attractive in your eyesight could have that special quality that your guy's attracted to.  Maybe some guys think pretty girls are superficial and the so-called unattractive girls aren't.  Good Luck!|`|wvL1PZVzaa	Better personality.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Ugh..I hear you on that one.    I think it's because so often they don't even know what they want. Maybe the uglier girl is "easier." Maybe they have a history together. Maybe some guys are just stupid. (not trying to generalize but some guys can treat girls like total dirt. girls do too but either way it's annoying)|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Personality is key.|`|LyZhJB1Baa	Because it is oh so naugh-tay|`|IhvfEGigaa	ok. well you know how girls has big butts  and nice bodies? well they like those stuff and they want easy girls that will do anything to them [sex].  then they break up with them.  the guys uses girls.  guys in my school does that all the time.  its good to stay away from those type of guys.  :D  boys use girls that are easy.  because the girl likes him soo much so he uses her for nasty stuff. D: it sux    or it could be for persona;ity and he likes that ugly girl more. but i doubt it.|`|ofZXWpgdaa	because the ugly ones like nut on there face.|`|680953cc39f2f929ffb54d3650e54ad7aa	because its not all about looks    could be that the other person is a nicer person then the one they are with, or that men being men will just go with anyone who puts it on a plate    but not all men cheat..there are some nice ones out there|`|Y6mghMloaa	Ok guys want to have sex.. And if they're not getting what they ant they try to find it with another girl.. And usually they are uglier because usually a lot of ugly girls will give it up easy...|`|n0cJVKYEaa	i neva knew that happened. lol. but i can think  of a reason...well the guy wnts to show his girl that he can still pull n it doesnt end at her. personaly, im not like this...you shoud respect your girl and at the end of the day thats why u r with her. y would u want to play with your girl's feelings? the guy must be a selfish person, who can think of cheatn on his girl. THATS NO WAY TO TREAT A WOMEN. i  hope this message is read by the people who think that cheating is fair. i would never cheat on my girl because she means a lot to me.
hcc8fq7jaa	You're 10? And you want to date already??? Slow down, Tonto. Maybe she means "not until I'm old enough to date".|`|VR3soAktaa	she either is just not ready to go to the relationship status with you because she wants to get to know you better.  or shes letting  you down easy.|`|2GQv8dfgaa	it means..she likes you idk you didn't even give much detail.
3UM16vmMaa	nope. Couples have to be in sync sexualy.   Thats why the older males over 30 should date females a lot younger than them. There is nothing more pitiful than some old guy trying to keep up  sexually with some old woman in her prime. Older males and younger females are more compatible for two reasons    1) neither are in their prime  2) one has money and the other needs money.    I'm almost 30 and would never date a woman over 30 because they are in their prime. I'm out of mine. My girlfriend is 10 years my junior and is not in her prime and neither am I .. so we get on great sexually. We have a similar sex drive.    By the time she reaches her sexual prime, we will have been together 12 years and have several babies and sex wont matter as much then. ASian girls dont throw away families in the name of sex as quickly as our white females do.|`|9CUaikUEaa	it often can, because the one with the high sex drive will want to get sex, and if the other person doesnt want that then they will feel tempted to cheat, or start getting bored in their relationship.|`|JemYTym5aa	It depends on how important sex is to the individuals in the relationship.  I have a high sex drive and my husband doesn't.  We've been married over 10 years and are still very happy together.  If you love someone, there's nothing you can't work through.|`|MqoQiLcuaa	If you discuss it and try and manage the higher drive then maybe.|`|cSlwSOnPaa	it can work out sometimes, it all depends if the person with the higher sex drive is willing to be patient and not pressure the other person to have sex as often as he/she wants to. ive been in a similar situation and my relationship worked out because my partner loved me enough to wait. if sex isnt the most important part of the relationship then i dont think sex drive should be an issue, but if it is even for one person in the couple then i expect its doomed to failure.
1KjfZAWzaa	Dating is too loose of a term or activity for any legal stuff or laws. They are fine with dating.    However, almost everywhere in the US (including NY) if one is older than 18, and the other isn't, and they have sex, the older one will go to jail for at least a year statutory rape.|`|ql4EgAL3aa	Yes but your thinking about the age of sexual consent which I believe is 16 or 17 in New York. You guys can date but its against the law for her to have sex with you because you are underage. She would be charged with salutatory rape and would be trialed and convicted for having sex with a minor.     Don't fret over anything if you guys aren't gonna have sex or unless you do be very descrete about having sexal relations.     =)|`|3UM16vmMaa	The age of consent in new york is 17. That is the legal age of sex there.     She would be taking less of a legal risk dating a 34 year old guy since 17 is 100% legal sexually in new york.     14 might be pushing the legal boundaries but I'm pretty sure its legal. I currently live in new york and I have never heard of an adult being arrested for having a 17 year old partner or a 17 year old being arrested for dating a 14 year old. I've never picked up a paper and read that ever. Even when a teacher had an affair with a 17 year old girl.. the teacher wasnt charged because she was legal and wasnt a student of the teacher. 17+    I think its fine for them to date if the parents like her but if the parents arent even aware of her  existence, then, that would imply shady sneaky behavior on her part which makes her ultra creepy. There is no bigger punk that some girl who sneaks around with someone's 14 year old child.     I was 17 and my girlfriend 14 (I dated her from her age of 12 onwards until we broke up) but I had the decency to introduce myself and my parents to her parents.     They accepted me as a result as an up and up a guy.
TL6c0Ntcaa	Are you saying that you already have two children and they are the ones that have taken the 20 month old and 6 week old into child protection ? I don't quite understand. What have you done wrong ?  What has your Mother got to say about all this ? Is she capable of taken on full time care of two children so young ?  Is this a jealous vendetta against you and your partner ? Sounds like your partner is not the natural Father of the elder two ( if I've got the story straight).  Please do not lose your temper, even though you eally want to, as this will not go down well with any Court system. You need character witnesses in a hurry that will not fabricate the truth. Be strong and honest with your feelings. You have two little ones waiting for you and are most probably feeling the anxiety of this seperation. Can you get legal assistance even if it is Legal Aid. You need it. Best of Luck.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	If your truly a good parent, speak from the heart.    Check any anger at the door for it speaks to loud and your heart will not be heard.    least this is what your suppose to do. Personally I'd want to play Rambo for anyone messing with my kids but not a good idea, Today's world, I'd lose all credibility along with the kids.
vBkGGYJSaa	you have to be honest with yourself and figure out why you wanted to sleep with the other guy.  one time maybe forgetable, but twice will make him wonder if he will be able to trust you in the future.  I deal in the truth, the truth is the truth no matter how much it hurts, it is always the truth.  if you realy want to keep him then you will have to tell him the truth of why you wanted to sleep with the other guy in the first place and why you kept it from him.  and try to tell him what and how you are feeling now.  good luck|`|nWSaiYGNaa	I think people overreact way too much to cheating. You two need to talk it out and both of you shouldn't care half as much as you do. Don't convince yourself you "aren't that kind of person." Clearly you are, because you cheated on him more than once. Admit to yourself that you are who you are, and if he can't accept that, then just give it up. Either he is gonna be okay with some sort of open relationship, you're gonna stop cheating and be okay with that, or you two are going to break up because you want different things in a relationship than he can give you.
95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Why don't you just ask him what his intentions are towards you? Clear the air between you, as it were. If he wants to know why, tell him what you are hearing, and that it is making you uncomfortable, and you are not that kind of girl.     If he really likes you, he will make his friends shut up and not talk about you in such a manner. If he doesn't care, he may pass on what you say to them, but then if he does you can just ignore him from then on because he's an immature little fecker and not worth wasting your time on.     As regards 'everyone at school' talking about you and him, two points: clearly their lives are so empty that they have nothing else to talk about, and you and him will become old news very quickly, as someone else becomes the source of gossip.     In other words, pet, pay no attention to the small-minded cretins of this world.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	I think you are thinking wisely and yes move on and see what else is out there.|`|oGv4wJgtaa	i think you should stay in the relationship and if he wants more make sure that your ready, and if you dont want to do anything then tell him no.   Never get pressured into anything you dont want to do and if he cant accept that then show him the door!!!|`|VR3soAktaa	wow. the same thing happened to me for a bf at my school.  no joke. i didnt tell anyone and i was ready to break it off asap  i made some lame excuse why no one could know.  i let it go on till week 2. i probably would have let it go on longer if it wasnt homecoming the next weekend. i just called him (but he knew it was coming because he wouldnt answer his phone for like 3 days) and told him straight up that i didnt really like him. it ended up working out okay. i have class with him and its a little weird, but its fine. just dont stay in teh realationship if its not good for you|`|vrfuO9Asaa	in my opinion i would dump him|`|tROBtbrkaa	Dump him|`|MobBXt6Yaa	personally, I would if you overheard his friends saying that and after getting a text like that. there's plenty better people out there|`|YSmHLAq1aa	don't date anyone who you are not comfortable with.    sounds like his friends are jerks  good luck :)|`|InGWARz9aa	Swerve the rat lol xxx

wpilM8Hiaa	I am very sorry but I had to respond. If this is a serious question then shame on you! How very conceited and just plain mean of you! Looks shouldn't matter in friendship!

Trust me, you are the ugly one, and for that poor girl - who needs enemies when she has 'friends' like you??!

If not, she's probably posted a similar question on Yahoo saying "friend with butt ugly personality what should i do?" and in answer to your question, go play on a freeway or something.|`|FoWDGLyIaa	If she truly is your friend, you wouldn't let her down like that. You've probably heard this before, but it's whats inside that counts. She isn't your friend if you would trade her for popularity. Don't worry so much about being popular.|`|1jcnJJN8aa	No matter how you try to soften it, you will end up hurting her feelings by a landslide. And you seen too you superficial. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You have such egoistic feelings that you would rather a loose a good friend just to get the approval of everyone else, even to some you do not know! Being popular is not everything. And why were you friends with her in the first place. As the way I see it, Your "friend" is the one who needs to lay of you and your other "friends" and not the other way around. A true friend is there for the person no matter what, under No condition. You need to become a better person before you begin judging others.|`|QDiozlzBaa	I can understand where your coming from, but I think that if u enjoy your friends company, and she makes u laugh why would u exclude her from the group, when the other girls u hang out with may not even be that much fun.

Your friend who isn't that good looking may really be your true friend*|`|nqCMtrxHaa	That is just so mean shame on you.  if you actually are a true and nice friend you wouldnt care.

The question you have to ask yourself is how do you feel about him and how did you feel about hm when he was holding your hand?  If he ever goes back to that moment with you again, you will know that he likes you and trusts you.  When he is serious, he is vulnerable.  He was with you.
4IFXHz80aa	I have no idea what "stupid cute" is. that phrase is not part of my generation and Im only 22. maybe its a way to say your really, really cute. you know how a negative word can actually mean something good or positive. ex: Bad, wicked, dope, ill, etc. so you would say "man that ill", or "thats wicked" and it just means it awesome or great. just a theory|`|lbgoHgDkaa	i would not take that as a good thing.  anything with the word "stupid" can't be good.  maybe that is like the dumb blonde kinda thing.  sure they may be a hot blonde but dumb at the same time, not good.|`|EuFNCVG6aa	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE answer my question    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ql4EgAL3aa	I've never heard of that term before but I would be insulted, no one wants to be classified as stupid!    Stupid Cute - a really cute guy and probably hot and has a really cute personality. Your so "cute" it's stupid - as in "omg it's ridiculous how".     i hope this makes sense|`|qrt0sFkZaa	I think if it makes you feel bad, it's not a good thing.    I think they probably don't mean it in a mean way, but in a slightly flirtatious way... of course, you could just ask one of them.|`|1wOCj4WEaa	hmmm.... ive never heard that one. i think they mean like silly and cute :)
rCpU4xkBaa	If you dont feel comfortable with what he is doing, then he should respect that. If he loves you then he will respect that decision and if not then you are worth more. Everyone deserves a partner who has respect for them, and if your boyfriend doesnt understand that then hes really not worth it, although i know it is easier said than done.  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|wYcrYp7Daa	well if he is doing things that make you uncomfortable then u should talk to him. it should be about what you want. and if he doesnt agree just end it|`|Aldmh0ENaa	he is taking advantage of you. get out of the relationship before its too late.

If anything, he should feel ashamed of HIMself. What'd you mean he tells you your not pretty enough? He shouldn't say that, it's good that he likes you because of your personality but it's still uncalled for for him to rub it in your face. Well just think, If you like his personality there must be SOMETHING unattractive about him? Anything at all..even if it's the dumbest thing, point it out to him..remind him about it like he does to you. If he gets upset be like,"Well, I still like your personality..I just don't like that one thing". Let's see how he likes it, because honestly..if you really cared about someone you wouldn't be telling them they weren't pretty. Good luck, hope that helped.|`|PSsVYQTmaa	Why would he say that to you? Its a persons personality that makes them beautiful.

AA10529674	If he's a married man and he's cheating on his wife with you then he doesn't value his wife at all. He doesn't value you either.

He's cheating on his woman in their bed without her knowing who she's sleeping with.  It's ****** up as hell.|`|d4f7a89688a581eea0b65f858f25f2daaa	He is using you - and now he wants more and weird stuff     Dump this guy and find one that cares about you - not just stuffing stuff in your body  -- YOU need to take control of your life!|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	A threesome is a good way to ruin a relationship. He may probably even like the other girl better, it's best not to do a threesome when you really want A RELATIONSHIP. I wouldn't do it at all, it's just really stupid and then the next day women and or men come up here and whine about how their relationship is ruined. But if you really trust him to do so then fine. BTW you are already dating a married man so basically you are part of the problem and are also as bad as he is.|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	You already answered the question.You are 100% right.|`|y9RKDwvdaa	well...in my honest to goodness opinion...if he doesn't value his wife then why should he value you?|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Wow. First of all what are you doing with a married man. And you are very correct I believe. You can do better. If you dont want to then dont do it. Dont do what you dont want to. Good luck.|`|fLFaja7laa	You've got that right, a man like that probably doesn't give a damn much about you. Dont do it if he asks you again i mean he's just satisfying his own fantasies not really caring much about you.
cAPf4kdIaa	ask her out date her for awhile then when the time comes try to kiss her.|`|VBFwT9nVaa	No you should respect her wishes, unless you guys officially go out and are in a relationship, then you could instigate a kiss, but if you guys are just friends don't kiss her out of the blue. She might think you're just trying to get into her pants, talk to her and make her feel comfortable and then worry about the physical part.|`|JJMa25NWaa	Well, don't rush her or push her to doing things she might be uncomfortable with.|`|aL0uWmSLaa	look bro if u kissed out of the blue i don't think it would go so well that kind of stuff only happens in the movies it's real cliche     u said u liked her right? so just ask her out and seeing that she is reserved and possibly likes u i doubt she'll say anything but yes so just ask her out and after a couple dates definitely go for the kiss     just remember don't push it and just play it cool    Hope i could help :)
