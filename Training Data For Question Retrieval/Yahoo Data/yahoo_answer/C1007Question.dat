Por las disculpas que Maradona pidió a los ingleses por el gol hecho "por la mano de Dios" , sus compa?eros del mundial 86 lo criticaron (Julio Olarticoechea, Claudio Borghi, Ricardo Giusti y Jorge Burruchaga).   Maradona, con esa lengua filosa e intolerante los ofendió mal.    Entonces, el periodista que no se calla nada, Sanfilippo,  trató a Maradona de "Es un enfermo este muchacho".      El se da el lujo de insultar a todo el mundo –prosiguió-. A ver si se cree que ganó el campeonato del mundo solo. Mirá que había muchos jugadores de primer nivel, Valdano, Burruchaga…".       No conforme, Sanfilippo se quejó de que "él insulta a cualquiera y se da el lujo de hacerlo y nadie reacciona". "El único que le dice algo a este pibe soy yo"      Qué opinás, Maradona se pelea con  todos  ?      Lo calificó de "enfermo" y de "mentiroso". El show de frases

Simplemente fue un fracaso del Proyecto de varias personas.Pero no de un Pueblo...Lo que deben replantearse ahora es lo siguiente desde mi humilde forma de ver las cosas desde afuera...   1o No creerse mejor que nadie      2o No hablar de màs (no hay que escupir para arriba...)      3o Mirar donde se juega bien al futbol y de ahi tomar como    ejemplo a seguir lo mejor de ese pais , club o lo que fuere( no tratar de imitar o creerse mejor por tener mas recursos humanos o economicos)      4o No dejarse enga?ar por los medios masivos de comunicacion...( En argentina, nuestro Heroe Maximo el Gral. San Martin lo dijo: Seras lo que debas ser o no seràs nada....")      5o Estudiar, trabajar y divertirse...      y Por Ultimo..andar buscando culpables no sirve de nada...si al fin y al cabo aun no ganaron mas que una copa de un mundial sub 17, mientras que otros ganaron muchas mas...Drogados, con hambre, o narigones ganan màs en el deporte màs popular...   Muchos de los que Escriben Preguntas , Responden y se hacen los criticos en este foro deberian entrenar o o hacer algo para que el futbol de su Pais crezca...no juzgo a nadie..festejo sus logros como latinoamericano y me dio gusto ver como crecieron cuando jugaron contra Argentina en el mundial de Alemania (porque fue un lindo partido)..por mi parte lamento que en nuestro pais se retroceda a nivel de seguridad en el futbol y demas..pero eso es otro tema que cualquiera puede opinar...FUERZA MEXICO..!!

Sucede que estuve como 1 a?o llendo a natacion y usaba tapones y todo pero aun asi me dio una infeccion, y me dolia cuando escuchaba musica fui con el doctor y estuve en tratamiento y ya estoy mejor. Me dijo que podia seguir llendo a natacion pero yo no estoy convencido prefiero cambiarme de actividad. En realidad a mi no me gustan los deportes, solo voy para mantenerme en forma y tener buena condicion fisica, todos necesitamos ejercitarnos. Pero ya empiezo a sentir los dias que no he hido. Para deportes en equipo como futbol no creo que sea buena idea porque solo voy a estar alli parado sin hacer nada y necesito hacer un ejercicio constante. En natacion tenia un instructor que me decia que hacer y las partes del cuerpo que trabajaba. Esta muy bien, pero prefiero cuidar mis oidos, aunque tambien es importante que me mantenga saludable. ?que actividad otra me recomiendan?

Right let me set the scene.Your Favorite team is facing your arch rival in a cup final of some sort (FA cup or CHamps League). Your Rivals are up 2-0 by halftime, favorited to win the game. In the last 10 minutes you equalise at two top class goals scored by your favorite player. In the last play of the game at stoppage time he Again scores the winning goal whether a free kick or a screamer?      This is my dream....Its Arsenal vs Man Utd in the Champs league final....Ronaldo scores two by halftime. At 80 minutes Fabregas dinks it over Van der sar and were back in the game. At 86 minutes Nasri crosses from out wide and Van Persie scores the header at 2-2. Arshavin gets subbed on at 90 minutes, then soon after at the last second of the game he paces around Ronaldo flicks the ball up and volleys it top corner.....wins the game

20090223102037AAI3CAr	Sports;Hockey	Mike Richards or Mike Ribeiro?	Ini my fantasy league, you get a set number of "points" which you can use to buy new players each week.  I'm currently deciding between Mike Richards and Mike Ribeiro.  I'm just trying to pick who will score more this week only.      Richards is on some major streak, 8 points in his last two games.  He plays @Wash, LA, Mtl, @NJ.  Wash and NJ will be tough to score I think.  Ribeiro gets to play four home games, against SJ, StL, Anaheim, Pittsburgh.  SJ is tough defensively of course, and StL and Ana are wild cards regarding their goaltending.  They could shut Dallas out or they could let in 6.        Richards has 60 pts in 54 games, while Ribeiro has 52 pts in 58 games.        Thoughts?

20090222221329AAOplXq	Sports;Basketball	PISTONS FANS: Did you guys really lose faith in Chauncey Billups?	I cant believe you guys wanted Billups out and were happy with this trade when it first happened. I have had countless arguments with my friends that Billups is a better TEAM player than Iverson. Billups won you guys a championship and he was your Finals MVP. He was the guy who led your team, was the captain of your team, and was your floor general. He knows how to run a game. Im sick of people saying Billups lost his touch. How did he lose his touch? In Denver he has given the Nuggets their best start since the 1976 season and he is playing really well there. I just want some of you Pistons fans to explain to me how Billups lost his touch? You guys went to the Eastern Conference Finals 6 times in a row or something like that. I know it sucks to lose there all the time but those are deep playoff runs. Why not give another crack at it for 2 more years instead of give up now. Plus I think Rodney Stuckey could learn a lot more about how to be a point guard from Billups than from Iverson.

20090223064043AA5NOYE	Sports;Basketball	More impressive: Wade going for 50 or Orlando with 7 players in double figures?	D-Wade had over half of his team's points and the rest of the starters were atrocious. Only Beasley off the bench had more than 10 points. I do give him credit; Wade did find some way to have 5 assists.       Orlando had 7 players in for over 15 minutes and all had at least 10 points. Howard went for 32 and 17 while winning the game big.        I like Wade, but how much more can his career be wasted with the mess that developed when my favorite old Lakers coach started playing “I will be the coach only when we win”.

20090223135637AAxNaHg	Sports;Basketball	Sports fans, don't you hate it when?	1. When people bring up a Champion that didn't happen close by or at least in the past decade? I hate it when I tell people, I'm a Spurs fan and they get defensive and say Celtics have won 16 (not hating) but it gets annoying.      2. When people are fans of teams, but can't even state a player who plays on that team? I respect your opinion of liking a team, but seriously not one player?      3. When people hate on a team for no reason, and have no understanding of backing it. Example: I hate the Boston Celtics because they took the Lakers title. Alright, see I can understand that but that doesn't give you the right to be all ignorant about that other team? Yeah, I hated the Lakers when they beat the Spurs but still do I care now? no....      If any of these have happened to you, don't you just hate it?
