iAPJcZhTaa	You have no chance at most of them except for remote possibly at Pitt, Clemson, Texas A&M,Arizona State, Penn State.  2.8 is not very good at all even if you go to an elite high school.  You are in for a rude awakening.|`|DlGsCtphaa	as much as the fencing might help, i dont think youll get into Duke, UNC, BC, or UF because Duke is almost Ivy level and the other schools are extremely competitive. unless you live in california, i dont think ucsd is gonna happen because its almost impossible to get in from out of state. <br>  brandeis is more unlikely, but you never know. same with NYU, Pitt, Clemson, Texas AM, ASU because they might think highly of the fencing.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	lets narrow your list.<br>  <br>  you need a 3.0 GPA for any UC in California,  and im pretty sure any Universityof any state<br>  <br>  you do have a good chance at state universities like arizona, penn state, etc.<br>  <br>  my advice is go for the state universities.  the average GPA for University of States are well over 3.00,  many over 3.6.<br>  <br>  you also need 100 hours volunteer work,  keep that in mind, so good luck to you.
nZpSM7ngaa	your GPA is not exactly ivy leauge school material,  but on the upside,  your dad is employed by them, and you do have a lot of extra curricular activities.  <br>  <br>  tell you what to do,  if you feel like you have a good chance on making it there with everything,  fill out an application,  if youre still worried about your GPA,  try to have your dad talk to a counselor or someone in the school,  and if you should even bother to send in an application,  because from what i hear,  people with over 4.00s get rejected.|`|SqAsjK0Qaa	I doubt it. It's possible, but not very likely at all. 2100 is good but not amazing by Ivy League standards, and a 3.6/3.75 won't impress any admissions director.
1yGDFTieaa	I paid ￡8 for 30 minutes piano tuition some 5 years ago now.<br>  <br>  I'd say between ￡9-￡14, depending on how you're going to teach the students. Presuming you're going to ask them to come to your house & play on your piano, I'd say no more than ￡11 for 30 minutes.<br>  If you're renting a building or a room, then ￡12-￡14 for 30 minutes, but really, there's no need for you to rent a room/building (more costly than it's worth). <br>  <br>  Oh and also, do photocopies of your certificates, frame them, and put them up where the students will be, just proves you've got the certificates you said you have been awarded and also motivates students. <br>  <br>  For 1 hour lessons, double the amount you would charge for 30 minutes, and subtract ￡1.50 - ￡2.50.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  And using Google to translate the currency:<br>  <br>  ￡1.50 = Aprox $2<br>  ￡2.50 = $3.50<br>  ￡9 = Aprox $12<br>  ￡10 = Aprox $14<br>  ￡11 = Aprox $15.50<br>  ￡12 = Aprox $16.90<br>  ￡13 = Aprox $18.30<br>  ￡14 = Aprox $19.70<br>  <br>  Have fun teaching!<br>  Oh and also, if you're planning on giving lessons to children, you may want to spend a few ￡s/$s getting yourself a CRB check (to look on your criminal record), a lot of parents wish to see proof that you're not a child molester, thief, been charged for assault, etc etc.|`|cJbWEyUYaa	Well I'm in England but my piano lessons cost I think about ten pounds per half hour. If I were you I would charge a bit less than that...maybe the equivalent of ￡7 or ￡8 (whatever that is in dollars!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you and good luck with everything!<br>  <br>  xx

Born a slave in Saint-Domingue, in a long struggle for independence Toussaint led enslaved Africans to victory over Europeans, abolished slavery, and secured native control over the colony in 1797 while nominally governor of the colony. He expelled the French commissioner Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, as well as the British armies; invaded Santo Domingo to free the slaves there; and wrote a constitution naming himself governor-for-life that established a new polity for the colony.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Especially between the years 1800 and 1802, Toussaint Louverture tried to rebuild the collapsed economy of Haiti and reestablish commercial contacts with the United States and Great Britain. His rule permitted the colony a taste of freedom which, after his death in exile, was gradually destroyed during the successive reigns of a series of despots. Translated from French, his name means "the awakening of all saints" or "all souls rising".

Miguel Hidalgo was born in the Corralejo Hacienda in Pénjamo, Guanajuato.[1][2] At the age of twelve, he was sent to school in Valladolid (now Morelia), Michoacan,[3]choosing to study for priesthood.[2] Hidalgo was ordained as a priest in 1778 when he was 25 years old.[4]Hidalgo had studied French in school, allowing him to read and study the works of the Enlightenment that was current in Europe[2] even though these ideas were forbidden at the time in Mexico.[1] He became dean of his old school in Valladolid in 1790, but his espousal of liberal ideas caused him problems there.[2] The Church sent him to work various parishes until he finally became parish priest in Dolores, Guanajuato.[4] He used his ability to study foreign scientific works to promote economic activities for the poor and indigeous people in his area such as establishing industries like brickmaking, potting and leather production.[1] Hidalgo did that in part due to his resentment of the exploitation by the Spanish-born population in Mexico, or peninsulares.[5]<br>  <br>  Father Hidalgo became involved with literary circles, which were a way to debate the social and political issues of the day. Hidalgo became part of a group in Querétaro which eventually conspired with him to separate New Spain from Spain.[6][6]However, their plot was denounced to authorities, before they were militarily ready. [1] Instead of going into hiding, Hidalgo decided to call the people of his parish to join in the struggle of independence in a speech that is now known as the Grito de Dolores.[1] People responded enthusiastically and Hidalgo became leader of the new army despite the fact that he had no military training at all.[5]<br>  <br>  Hidalgo’s army marched through the Bajio area, capturing Atotonilco, San Miguel el Grande (Allende), Chamucuero, Celaya, Salamanca, Irapuato and Silao, to the city of Guanajuato, adopting the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe as his banner.[7] Because of the lack of military discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting and ransacking the towns they were capturing. They began to execute prisoners as well.[1] From Guanajuato, Hidalgo set off for Valladolid, taking it with little opposition.[4] After staying in Valladolid for a while, Hidalgo and his troops left for Mexico City, through|`|AA10864970	<a href="http://thelouvertureproject.org/index.php?title=Toussaint_Louverture" rel="nofollow">http://thelouvertureproject.org/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/bolivar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/boliv...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/pages_kids/history/biographies/biohidalgo_kids.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/pages_kids/hi...</a>

mSVXV2gbaa	Good essay.  I have made a couple of stylistic/grammar changes to enhance readability, and corrected a couple of usage errors.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best - we need more dedicated nurses!  Feel free to email me with additional questions.<br>  <br>  Nursing to me means a better future for my family. As I started a family at a young age, there was little time for college or career. I am a very dedicated mother and chose to be there for my children during their early years. I know that there is nothing more important in the whole world. I am now at the point in my life when a career is very important to me, and am ready to dedicate myself to a career that I have a passion for. That career for me is nursing. I have wanted to be a nurse from a very young age. Every nurse that I have come in contact with has inspired me with knowledge and expertise. A nurse’s ability to care for patients’ complex medical needs and still be a caring and helpful support to patients and families fascinates me. <br>  I am very dedicated to my goal of becoming a nurse, and have worked very hard to make it to this point in my education, always  striving to be the best that I can be. I earned a 4.0 GPA at Davenport, WAS OR AM among the top students in most of my classes, and believe that I have proven that I have what it takes to succeed in this challenging career. While taking classes at Davenport I have also prepared myself for nursing by volunteering as a friendly visitor at Season’s Adult Day Care QUESTION - IS IT REALLY POSSESSIVE “SEASON” OR IS IT “SEASONS”?.   I have gained experience talking to elderly people with diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. I helped participants at Season’s with activities, games, and exercises. I have made many friends at Season’s and have gained a lot of respect and admiration for the elderly. I have always been very interested in health and wellness, and try to practice healthy living practices every day such as proper nutrition and regular exercise. I believe it is important as a nurse to be a role model for good health. As a nurse I will be an advocate for a healthy lifestyle. Educating patients and their families about health and wellness will be very exciting for me. <br>  Presently, my goal is to become a registered nurse working in the field of geriatrics or rehabilitation. In the future I plan to get a Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing and may work in health education. I know I have the determination and drive to be successful. I will do whatever it takes to accomplish my goals. I have no doubts that if accepted into the nursing program, I will strive to be the top of my class. I am very excited to begin the clinical phase of my education and start building the skills I will use in my career as a nurse.|`|pdbc4souaa	I am now ready to dedicate myself to the career that I have a passion for: nursing.. <br>  <br>  A MINOR CHANGE WHICH MAY MAKE THE LINE MORE VIGOROUS.<br>  <br>  A nurse’s ability to care for a patient’s complex medical needs and still be a caring and helpful support to the patient and their entire family fascinates me.<br>  <br>  [SEPARATE PARAGRAPHS HERE]   MAYBE YOU DID AND YAHOO! DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU<br>  <br>  I am very dedicated to my goal of becoming a nurse.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Other than that, it is articulate, direct and well-organized.<br>  Good luck with all that.

fyyfPEemaa	In the U.S., a university offers graduate degrees (masters, doctorate), a college only offers bachelor's degrees.<br>  <br>  In Canada:<br>  They use college and university interchangeably. They both are institution of higher education after high school (grade 12). "Community college" is a term to define a two year school where one could achieve an AA, Associates degree, or two complete general education needed to transfer to a four year (four year = college/university; you can also complete general education at four years as well).

If we learn something, understand something, or know something, but no one can tell, then I think that would be a bit pointless.
ENbE1Hi2aa	Actually it can.  Depends on your state law.  Drop by Homeedmag.com and look up your state's requirements.  Might be helpful to also find a support group in your area (Home Ed Mag again) and get some local info.  Often the locals know enough about the individual school district personnel and their attitudes towards homeschooling to ease you through it. Some have a letter that has already been accepted you can copy. <br>  <br>  And in some states it's your business how you choose to raise and educate your child.  Just like if your child was in private school you would not have to notify the government, homeschooling is just another alternative available to parents.  Lesson No. 1 of homeschooling: it's YOUR family, and you make the decisions, not the government. <br>  <br>  Welcome, and all the best of luck to you and your daughter.|`|yJSPecgoaa	You would first want to find out what the homeschooling laws are in your particular state, as they do vary, as do the procedures to follow in removing your daughter from public school.

DWit98Spaa	So you're right and wrong. First let's talk about what ice is: the solid form of a water. H2O is a little tricky because it has a very specific structure it needs to form into to transition from liquid to solid (one of the reasons why Ice actually expands when it freezes, something very few other molecules do).<br>  <br>  Because it needs to be in a very-specific crystalline structure, it takes time for the molecules to arrange themselves. Warm water means that the average water molecules have more kinetic energy...they zip along at a faster rate. Cold water means less kinetic energy, or are, on average, slower moving. <br>  <br>  That is why warm water forms ice faster: the molecules can arrange themselves in the crystal structure faster because the molecules are moving faster. Whereas cold water will take a bit longer because they don't get to their "destination" as fast. <br>  <br>  However, it's not like boiling water will freeze faster than ice cold water, not at all. I'm talking about water that's at like...room temperature compared to cold tap water, and even then it's not that significant, so you are right in one sense. But it is true that water that is warm will freeze faster than water that is slightly cold. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  -------<br>  Boy...did you even read my post? Fine, let's talk quantum levels. The quantum states of higher energy particles have an intuitively increased entropy level as those with lower states. Solids, as you should know based on you "thermodynamic knowledge"  require arrangements of particular quantum energy levels to for covalent and ionic bonds. Higher energy particles (warmer water) has an increased probability of quantum states in the required energy, e. This is easily derived from Schroedinger's equation. <br>  <br>  So it makes perfect sense that warm (not hot) water's increased probability of maintaining quantum states (and spin) will form solidified crystals faster than colder water where the probability, g, is slightly less. And again, I'm not talking about extreme conditions where.<br>  <br>  And frankly it's laughable that someone who claims to be the"ones that study thermodynamics" doesn't understand or realize this. You're in the wrong line of work.|`|iEEcWPA1aa	The Mpemba effect happens MORE than occasionally- in my  A Level year I did a whole experiment on the Mpemba effect and I found that the hot water always froze faster except for the cold samples that were at extremely low temperatures (e.g. 3 degrees).<br>  <br>  I think you are the one who is misinformed!

77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	Present this question to the science dept at the New College. Ask them what percentage of their premed students are accepted to American medical schools. That should give you a bit of an idea. Med schools do rely on GPA for admission.  It is not the only factor, but it is a major, important factor.  They are going to need some way to compare you with the other applicants.  <br>  If you were going to some big name, prestigious school that did not issue grades, that would be different.  I have never heard of this school before, so I am unsure what sort of reputation New College has with the med schools.<br>  Whatever school you decide to attend, a very important factor is to find out what % of their premeds actually get accepted.  If it is not favorable, go somewhere else.  No need to waste your time with a school that the med schools consider to be less than

mbXHkf1maa	Perfectly fine.  It's one of the occasional grammatical myths you encounter that "they" and "their" can't be used for inanimate objects.  It's not difficult to find counterexamples in published writing dating from the present back over a century.<br>  <br>  "There were gold chairs, their legs brittle and set the way pulled candy was"<br>  - Eudora Welty, The Golden Apples<br>  <br>  " room only for two contemporary chairs, their legs like spikes, their seats and backs of thick sponge rubber."<br>  - Jon Creasey, A Bundle for the Toff<br>  <br>  "Before them loomed an army of tables, their legs standing at attention on the dirty carpet"<br>  -  Shirley Rousseau Murphy, Cat on the Edge<br>  <br>  "The tables were becoming office tables; their legs were the legs of office tables, and yet they were still strewn with plates and glasses"<br>  - Virginia Woolf, The Years<br>  <br>  "iron bedsteads and rickety tables, their legs in the air, piled up together with torn mattresses"<br>  - Alphonse Daudet, Little What's-his-name<br>  <br>  "elegant drawing-room tables, their legs studied from the hinder- legs of dogs"<br>  - Clarence Cook, 19th century author and art critic|`|o3Jpfflgaa	Well, since 'their' is a pronoun, using it like your example is incorrect 'according to the book'.  <br>  <br>  I agree that it's common use to say it that way.  I also agree that it does sound OK.<br>  <br>  Because the trick would be to remember not to use it, it might be better to learn to use it "by the book".|`|BVSa6bYkaa	Their is a pronoun and pronouns describe people. Adjectives describe  nouns--which would include things.  I love those chairs- "THOSE" is possessive which means you are speaking of more than one chair and I don't like the legs which many chairs have 4 individual legs, right. <br>  <br>  How about: I love those chairs except the legs are plain (or except the legs are not decorative. etc)<br>  <br>  By using the word "their" when it comes to "things" then it would be considered metaphor=bringing to life inanimate objects. For example: The trees sang a sweet melody as the wind blew through (their leaves or the leaves)? You are talking about many leaves; yet, each leaf is individual just as legs of a chair- individual parts making up many.|`|lLij19HKaa	How else would your teacher refer to them, then?<br>  <br>  A noun is a person, place, or thing. Animals are not people, yet they are sentient beings, and they are classed as 'things' in English. We use the pronoun 'their' in referring to them. According to strict English-usage rules, they are no different than chairs.|`|m9LxTsc3aa	Their is a possessive form. It shows possession, and technically a thing can own anything; so in the strictest usage of "their," it should not be used w/inanimate objects. But, it is done, like so many other mis-used words. <br>  <br>  Try substituting "the" for "their".|`|fecUjSr1aa	YES ... the word "their" can denote possession to people and things .. but it must be used in the plural form ..<br>  <br>  the buildings and their surroundings ..<br>  the trees and their environment<br>  the community and their customs ..|`|ktP0VhVaaa	Well...

Ur going tomorrow?<br>  <br>  So people have been talking that way for a while and are probably too lazy to put apostrophes  or complete words the proper way. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, some people do have difficulty with spelling and I've noticed it getting worse and worse. Im in college now and I feel I can write and spell pretty decent according to my level. However there are people who are my age, or older and can't write well at all. Language doesn't come naturally for everyone. Also remember the impact of technology on our lives. We make a spelling mistake and wordcheck fixes it. When we don't have wordcheck we don't realize our errors. Less people are reading. Kids don't read they play video games and use the computer. This seriously impacts language. <br>  <br>  Those are the reasons I could come up with. I also think the schools aren't teaching the same way. The world is changing in every way. There are more troubled kids and kids with learning disabilities. There are less teachers and bigger classrooms. As a result, we are not learning the same way we did 30 years ago. I'm 18 now and I find they don't teach the same as they did 10 years ago.|`|m01ijLFUaa	People are just too lazy.<br>  <br>  :D

Then the other applications/offers are all automatically cancelled, UCAS will notify all the unis of your decisions. You should be able to do this on UCAS track, although there is no real reason to do it if you are still waiting for decisions from unis, just because you might want to make somewhere that has yet to reply to you your insurance choice.

4drQ38qZaa	Well at my school I'm in the same situation as you. We have pods and there are three pods for each grade. Like 6th grade has the pods 6-3, 6-2, and 6-1. Then 7th grade and 8th grade have to 1,2, and 3 also. I got put in 6-3 with none of my friends except for my sister and we had to basically make new friends. But it was okay. I'm alive. Lol. <br>  We had like 7 classes to go through the day. They were:<br>  Connections 1<br>  Connections 2<br>  Block 3<br>  Block 4 (lunch)<br>  Block 5<br>  Block 6<br>  Block 7<br>  <br>  The connections were like the extra classes like music classes (band, chorus, or orchestra), P.E, health, and the other few (art, keyboarding or business and drama). The connection classes change every semester which were 9 week but this could be different in your school. But when you were in connections you get to be with different kids from different pods in your grade so you got to see different people and your friends. But basically classes and such are randomized and you have no idea. It is luck and chance. Good luck!|`|FsVZCk0laa	That was hard to read.<br>  <br>  It depends on the school.

3e6175bba38d844ea9a99e1eab5894b2aa	You do have to cite everything you take even if you paraphrase.  I cannot understand your teaching telling you something like that.  I am in academia and the students need to quote and cite.<br>  I do not know which format your teachers want you to cite but I use APA because I am in Education.<br>  The rule of thumb at most universities is that if you take two words, you need to cite it and quote it at the end.  It is a little more work but it goes a long way.  If you do not do it that way one of your teachers might decide it is plagiarism and then......  the consequences could go all the way from being given a bad grade to being expelled from school.<br>  Be on the safe side and if it is not your original idea, cite and quote.  Ask your teacher which format they want and get a book.  They are not expensive or you can subscribe to sites where they will show you how to quote.  Some sites are free while others are paid.  Well worth the money.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes need not quote every little thing<br>  --You know that you can write E  mail messages to me  through this section by clicking the word e mail by opening  my  profile|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	If all you are doing is giving a definition of carbon monoxide, you do not need to cite it.  This is known as "common knowledge."  It's a basic fact that will appear in any reseach source you use.  It's like, you wouldn't have to cite that George Washington was the first President of the U.S.  It's common knowledge.  Now, if you're going to write that Washington had syphilis or had an extra-marital affair, you have to cite where you got this info.  Even if it's wrong, you're covered because you have indicated where you got the info.<br>  Do remember that a list of works cited is just that:  you must have a citation within the paper itself that refers to the list of works cited.  Suppose you used something on page 34 of a book by John Smith.  You would put (Smith 34) in the paper, and in the works cited you would put a full citation.  For example:  Smith, John.  Title of Book (underlined).  City of Publication: Name of Publisher, date of publication.   (This would be MLA style)  <br>  A list of everything you used, without having directly cited it, is a bibliography, not a works cited.  Don't feel bad; most teachers don't even know that.<br>  Edit:  To =)  You're wrong.  Paraphrasing (changing the words) must be cited.  It's plagiarism if you don't.|`|wKiYt10baa	Yes you have to put quotes around it or else it would be considered plagiarism. Even thought you already have a works cited page of the sites that you found info on it's important to quote the sentence and the write the site  as a foot note. <br>  <br>  As long as it's not your idea even if you have changed some words around in sentences to make it your own but kept the same meaning it's considered plagiarism because it's like stealling the idea of another person and chaging the words and saying that it's your own.|`|dUeDmb7raa	yes you have to quote it and cite your sources<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i mean you don't have to do it, but you will fail the assignment if you don't<br>  <br>  <br>  they have programs they submit papers to that says what parts you plagiarized and from where<br>  <br>  <br>  for citing your sources it doesnt matter if you do it after the quote or with number bullet points, with the source at the bottom. all that matters is that you pick one and stay consistent with it|`|S3JaKxoOaa	You should be okay, if you just change the words around a bit, and it's always safe just to put the source in parenthises after words. But you shouldn't really have to do that, unless you use there exact words in a scentence.
cddb777eba8aa486c8115040d8875907aa	I attended a high school that was all girl.  It changed to a coed high school.  I was in the last all girl class.  At an all girl school the girls weren't concerned about style and looking good.  They were just being comfortably.  As soon as the school went coed you had girls in the bathroom before school with their curling irons and makeup.  <br>  <br>  Girls had all of the leadership opportunities.  I was the yearbook editor which I believe I never would have been in a coed high school<br>  <br>  The first year the school went coed there were 93 girls and 7 boys in the class.  Freshman class elections were held one month into the school year and a boy was elected for both president and vice president.  Obviously this was the fault of pretty silly girls.  Girls just gave up leadership positions to the guys.<br>  <br>  Our homecoming game use to be the volleyball game.  Two years after going coed they started a boys basketball team and that became the homecoming game with the boys honored at the pep rally and the girls ignored.<br>  <br>  Girls that are extremely outgoing and confident will do well at any school but for girls who are a little shy and lacking in self confidence and all girl school will give them opportunities that they will never have in a coed school.|`|c0iKagupaa	I go to a catholic school right now, but it's not an all girl school. The high school that most girls from my school go to is an all girl school. The education level is high, and it seems like a lot of fun. Boys are pretty annoying and when you go to an all girl school, you get a big break. The only time you'll probably see boys is during a school dance, or something like that. I think that catholic schools have higher education levels than most public school, which is good. Mostly, I think the decision to go to this school is up to you, but I think you will like it and I hope this helps.|`|PLDRCAWlaa	My mom wanted me to go to an All Girl's Catholic High School and I said No. It's just that for me I can't stand being around ALL girls ALL day it would just make me go crazy.

It wouldn't hurt to buy the practice test book from the collegeboard, but its essentially the same information, I recommend taking it in May, and if you do badly(despite an A in the class), you don't have to report the score, and you can take it again.

HBuVvbOFaa	WOW! The question that's super important here is what was done during the 24 years that said guy was out of school. Did he get another degree? Did he work for a Fortune 500 company? Start his own business? Work as a paralegal?  ...anything that would work to his advantage in trying to impress an admissions council?  <br>  <br>  Also, with that GPA a great LSAT score needs to be in his package.  a 150 will not cut it and I would think that a 159 would hardly do anything for him. <br>  <br>  Could he get into A law school? Sure! But could he get into a law school that would net him a job that pays enough to get him out of the debt that he got into going to law school in the first place? Probably not. I mean unless his best friend, father, god father, uncle was an atty or he worked for one for so many years that they'll pick him up, I don't see why someone who is at least 45 years old would want to change his life's path this late in the game unless he already had money and just wanted a JD for the heck of it.<br>  <br>  Don't go to Thomas Cooley or Florida Coastal just because you can, they'll rip you off and you won't get a great job unless you are super motivated and on the grind 100% of the time.

fb8eDg4Naa	Well, college is certainly a plausible goal to achieve.  But it seems like Yale or any other Ivy League school may be a little too far.  You may very well be intelligent enough to keep up with their curriculum, but your numbers don't really favor you.  In this day and age, you have to have the ability but also the accomplishments for schools to even consider you.  A 1.9 GPA and a B- in basic algebra won't fly when it comes to submitting your transcript.  But a big-named school isn't everything.  Go to a smaller school, one with more lenient standards.  You can still succeed in life without going to Yale.  In fact, a study done by Princeton proved that graduates from state-funded public schools received just as much money in their salary as Ivy League graduates.  Everyone has the chance to make something they're happy with out of their themselves.  You'll be just fine.|`|bzkfRcRfaa	is this a joke? i'll assume you're not joking and i'll take this seriously.<br>  you won't get into yale or cornell. you'd be lucky to get into a state university. you can join the army. you can't be an astronaut. and you have a misconceived notion if you think that an astronaut "doesnt do any work" because the work to become one is grueling|`|N8wNmQShaa	Nice joke...<br>  <br>  A soldier to use a gun?

But I highly recomend doing manual labor, your grammar and common sense is poor, manual labor might be your only hope! <br>  <br>  Also, the Army as well as the US Military itself may be a lot of things, but I can tell you this much, from a girl who is coming from generations of military men. They do NOT accept complete mental morons!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. You will NEVER get into Yale with that GPA and grammar. I dare you to prove me wrong!

But it is very competitive to get those positions. You should go to the website of a school district, as you may be able find out public school teacher salaries there, eg; LAUSD's salary charts are online.

Public schools pay more than private schools. Private schools might pay less, however, there are less students per class and the environment in which you teach in is "nicer." Depends on if money counts for you or a better, more enjoyable experience.

CtqWRAcFaa	I think the idiom "to sell out" is best used referring to "selling (YOURSELF) out."<br>  <br>  "To sell out" refers to abandoning one's principles for money, and I think it's something a person does to himself.<br>  <br>  Possibly you could use the expression, "selling the poor down the river."<br>  <br>  This phrase comes from the days of slavery, when a heartless slave owner would -- because of a hunger for money -- sell a slave to a new owner who lived "down" (meaning "further south") the Mississippi River -- into much worse conditions in the deeper south.<br>  <br>  To "sell (someone) down the river" therefore means to betray that person into a cruel fate in exchange for money.<br>  <br>  But probably "lets them down" is the best idiomatic expression for this kind of betrayal or abandonment.<br>  ____________________<br>  <br>  In the case of the second problem. the closest I think we would use in English is (ironically) a French or Latin phrase:<br>  <br>  Chacun à son go?t<br>  <br>  French expression literally translated as "Each has his own taste." Often used as a way of saying you don't agree with someone else's tastes, as in "There's no accounting for tastes" or  "Everyone has his own tastes.<br>  <br>  (Latin) "De gustibus non est disputandum." ("There is no arguing about tastes.")<br>  <br>  The humor writer Dave Barry makes this joke:  "Everyone is entitled to his own opinion -- and yours is wrong."|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Fair-weathered friend.<br>  <br>  Different Strokes for Different folks.

I was once interested in DeVry, so I know every trick in the book these people use to get people to attend.<br>  <br>  Credits from for profit schools are dicey when transfering to a real school.

Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Duke, Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Berklee Music, UMass, UFlorida, UTexas, and thousands more are all online.<br>  <br>  Some really low-level colleges teach online too.  Those are the schools you hear people talk about "can't do anything" with the degree.  It's not about online vs classroom, it's about their school has a bad reputation - period.<br>  <br>  You don't tell us what you want to study and at what level.

But all I can say about AP Euro is that if you aren't good in the social sciences you would probably be better off taking regular world history and instead taking advance classes in your preferred subjects. But if you do consider yourself a history buff, AP Euro will be one of the most interesting classes you take in high school.|`|jyVqvRxHaa	don't take it and go to community college.

s1xoaIBAaa	Complicated question. Here's a brief summary.<br>  <br>  In the early days of Christianity, the Pope had little power. He was merely the leader of the local congregation of minor religion. As the heir of Peter he had some prestige, and other Christian congregations deferred a little to him, but he could not decide doctrinal issues, nor did other churches have to obey him. He, of course, had no power over the Roman state. Quite, the reverse, as the leader of despised, and often illegal group he was often persecuted. <br>  <br>  This began to change when Constantine converted to Christianity. The pope was no longer part of a persecuted group. However, he still had no power over the state. He was recognized as one of the leaders of the Church, but the Bishops of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch also claimed equal status as heirs of the Apostles. Constantine transferred the capital to Constantinople and the Bishop of Constantinople eventually gained status equal to the other four. These five Bishops (Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria) were known as the Patriarchs, and were considered equals. Rome claimed a primacy, but it was never recognized by the other Patriarchs. The Pope had a rocky relationship with the Emperor as well. In the doctrinal disputes of the period the Pope was on occasion arrested and deported for opposing the Emperor's views on theology. The Pope did have some success in enforcing his primacy in the western parts of the Empire, however.<br>  <br>  When the Western part of the Roman Empire began to fall apart, the Pope and other bishops often took over the administration of the cities. The declining power of the Eastern Emperor in Italy allowed the Pope to become the de facto ruler of the areas around Rome. He, however, theoretically was still subject to the Eastern Empire. The Pope and the Eastern Emperor's representative, the Exarch, between them opposed the Lombards, who had invaded northern Italy. When the Lombards defeated the Exarch, the Pope was cut off and threatened.<br>  <br>  The pope responded by allying with the Franks. The Franks at this time had a dynasty of kings, the Merovingians, who were all but powerless. The real power was held by Pepin, the Mayor of the Palace. The Pope deposed the last Merovingian king and named Pepin king. Pepin invaded northern Ital and overthrew the Lombards. He gave the Pope a large swath of land, the Donation of Pepin. At about the same time a forgery was made claiming that Constantine had granted the Pope the entire Western Empire. This "Donation of Constantine" was used throughout the Middle Ages to bolster Papal claims to political power. The Donation of Constantine was proven to be a forgery in the 15th century on linguistic grounds.<br>  <br>  In 800, the Pope crowned Pepin's son, Charlemagne as Emperor. The right to crown the Holy Roman Emperor remained a papal prerogative throughout the Middle Ages. <br>  <br>  From 800 on Papal power increased. It was an interesting power however, as it was based almost solely on prestige and "spiritual" powers. As a military power the papacy was actually quite weak. The popes eventually claimed the authority depose kings and emperors, something the kings and emperors firmly rejected. The popes also claimed and often had power over the Churches in the various states of Europe. This led to a great deal of conflict with kings as, in addition to having spiritual powers, the bishops and abbots were major landholders. The kings quite naturally wanted to control and tax these landholders, something which the church resisted.|`|SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  Catholics recognize the pope as a successor to St. Peter. The power of the pope varied during the middle ages (a pretty long period). The pope had, and still has, the power to excommunicate people. <br>  <br>  Back then people thought that kings and emperors got their power from God. So those who wanted to become kings needed to be in the good graces of the church. <br>  Hope this helped!|`|T6kTBvouaa	well Peter was the first Pope when Jesus said he would build his church around Peter (Peter means "the rock"). The church had a huge influence. They were a mega power and many people pledged allegiance to them. also with the friars and priesthoods it helped many people get a great education. Those are all good things, but also think about the Crusades, not so good.|`|ufv6Wd39aa	you forgot the third question:<br>  what is the relationship between the quote and the power of the church and the pope?<br>  <br>  the quote is "power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely" by Lord Acton<br>  <br>  :]
R6ljSjWwaa	In business you'll learn the techniques and ways of working in business. Because you don't know what kind of business you want yet, then yes, I suggest you major in business. But be sure to think about the kind of business you want to open before it's too late, in the sense that you shouldn't just learn the techniques and not know what to do with them after. Unless you decide to work IN a company instead of opening your own.

I would just stay in bed and there was nothing my mom could do to make me go. And I kept missing like atleast 3 days a week. My parents got really angry and I told them I am doing it because I can't take it anymore, and they finally agreed that if I could hold out until the end of the year I could be home schooled, and I did.<br>  Maybe you could arrange something like that?

ac135f925fe976c56b3113aa450c69d1aa	It honestly depends on you.  Yeah, objectively speaking, it's a lot.  But it might not be a lot for you.  Some people believe that taking 9 units during one semester is overwhelming.  Others can handle more than 30 units in a semester.<br>  <br>  Here are some things to consider before you take 27 units this summer:<br>  <br>  1.  Whether the classes are related in some meaningful way.  It's much easier to take a giant load of classes if they are all related because when you study for one class it's like you're studying for all of your classes.  Related classes reinforce each other and give you a more meaningful educational experience.  Aim for a total immersion in one subject area.<br>  <br>  2.  Your ability to read and write quickly.  If you have 9 classes, you'll have to read 9 textbooks.  If your classes are about 6 weeks long, that means you're reading the equivalent of 1.333 textbooks per week.  It's doable if you have speed reading skills, but you should know what you're getting yourself into.  Try to peruse the books ahead of time.  Same with class assignments.  If each class requires two ten to fifteen page papers, you're talking about 180-270 pages of writing.  That's like writing a book.  It's not impossible, but you have to be pretty confident in your writing skills in order to pull it off.  You should also take a good look at the assignment guidelines before signing up for class.<br>  <br>  3.  Your physical and mental stamina.  What you're proposing is NOT for weaklings.    You may end up sitting at your computer for 16 hours a day.  It will take a toll on your nutritional habits, your physical fitness and your immune system.  You should take a good look at your current physical health to ensure that you're strong enough for the long hours and the extra stress.  I wouldn't attempt anything like this if you are getting over a major disease or if you have a condition affected by stress.  If you are healthy, I believe that you can counter a lot of the stress-related dangers by training for this in the same manner that you would train for a marathon.  This sort of thing takes a lot of mental and physical preparation.<br>  <br>  4.  Your attitude.  You've got to be crazy-determined.  You've also got to be able to deal with all the people who will tell you that it's impossible.  Lastly, you've got to see it for what it is:  just a few short weeks.  On the one hand, you've got to be on top of everything the first second.  On the other hand, an insane summer school schedule will still leave you with at least four weeks to be young and have fun.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Best of luck.|`|8pbNhROMaa	That is an INSANE courseload.  First of all, summer session is shorter than a regular term, so most people take fewer credits in summer (9 to 12 units for summer instead of 15 to 18 for a regular term). Taking 27 units in summer is similar to taking 45 units in a regular term. <br>  <br>  Second, online classes are often more time-consuming than on-campus classes. I have taken online classes that have required 2 to 3 times the time and effort of on campus classes. Of course, everyone learns differently and maybe online classes will be easier for you, but that is still an awful lot of time to spend on coursework.<br>  <br>  Third, saying that you have nothing to do all summer is not the same as wanting to spend every waking moment doing schoolwork. Do you really not want to have any fun at all this summer? No time to spend with your girlfriend? No trips to the beach with your friends? <br>  <br>  If you really want to take a heavy courseload, try taking 18 units. That is the equivalent of going to school full-time and working full-time, and should keep you plenty busy for the summer.|`|933XLRGCaa	Once, I took 10 over a winter session and almost died.  That was with an advanced English class, statistics, and a sociology class though, so if they were easier classes I might have had an easier time.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the length of the summer sessions, I wouldn't take more than 15 units total. If you work a lot, then I'd reduce that to 9 or so.  Online classes are generally easier; that is, they're usually not math or foreign language classes or anything so they will be easy.  Still, with that many classes, it probably more work than you think of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GokA3YGkaa	Summer quarter is SHORTER than all other quarters/terms... keep that in mind.

It's one of the most beautiful places on the planet and you'll love it!<br>  <br>  I booked my trip through a travel agent friend. He told me that if I booked in a place that caters to the European crowd, I'd save 25% to 30% off my room rate, which is substantial there. The only thing is they will expect you to speak French. I don't, but I took it in school and got some audio tapes a few months before the trip. The people I dealt with at the hotel obviously knew I was out of my league with French, but appreciated the effort and treated me well.<br>  <br>  And remember, the hotel owner doesn't really own the hut you will be staying in. The geckos do. :o)
cMZEmpp0aa	In my experiences, while professors will put effort into making sure they don't have every correct answer in their exams fall on one or two letters (e.g. the write answer is always letter B or D), many or possibly even most of them don't go out of their way to prevent several questions in a row from having the same letter as the correct answer (e.g. five correct answers of A all in a row). In fact, many of the professors I have worked with have been surprised when they found out they had blocks of questions with the same letter answer. Also keep in mind that some professors (especially those who teach large lectures) will often produce multiple versions of a test to prevent cheating. In a case like that, all of the tests might have the same content, but the questions will be in a different order. In those situations one set of tests might have blocks of questions with the same answer while other sets might not. So unless you know for a fact that a particular professor goes out of his or her way to avoid situations like that, it's not really something you should worry about in choosing your answers to questions. Worry more about what the question is actually asking and what each answer option actually says.|`|qlCHegC5aa	I always wondered that too.<br>  <br>  I never let myself put one answer more than 5 times in a row, because I always feel like one of them will end up wrong.|`|FIymMqm9aa	Well, if I get the same answer more than 3 times in a row, I go back and double check.  Also, if I'm not sure, let's say, if it's 'a' or 'c' and I've had 3 'a's already, I'll pick 'c'.<br>  <br>  You could say that a professor or whoever makes the test would make them evened out, but what if he wants you to think that?  What if he purposely makes 5 questions in a row have the answer of 'a'?<br>  <br>  It all depends on the teacher, I suppose.|`|kPXIVKUuaa	My teachers don't seem to balance out the choices, in one exam I completed, 12 out of 15 questions were D and I got them all right. But I think it depends on the teacher or who designed the Exam. The exams like A-Levels and the HSC seem to be balanced because they are computer generated.
3lPL6pVBaa	Do the right thing.  <br>  <br>  In other words, you're allowed to -think- any thoughts you want.  Having crushes is perfectly normal, even having crushes on teachers.  I did.  It's no big deal.  <br>  <br>  Just make sure that you always -do- the right thing and -say- the right thing so that you don't hurt other people and so that you don't allow other people to hurt you.  <br>  <br>  Morality is really just -not- hurting other people (or yourself).  <br>  <br>  Do that, and you're a perfect person.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, everybody gets hurt sometimes and everybody hurts somebody by mistake eventually.  If that happens, fix the problem, forgive yourself, resolve to avoid hurting people in the future, and keep moving forward.  <br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  I sort of gave a more general answer than you were asking for.  I hope it was useful in some way.  Think anything you like.  Work out all of your feelings in your -head-.  Take enough time to get calm when the world is upsetting you or rushing you.  Then . . . <br>  <br>  do right.  <br>  <br>   : )|`|ZM5Fbs0xaa	omg, I had the BIGGEST crush on my english teacher. But then I got out of his class at the end of the year and realized he was kind of a jerk. haha|`|1vaqtRI2aa	You should have posted this in polls and surveys- you'd probably get a bigger responce.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, yes, I've been attracted to teachers before.|`|510MC9SVaa	Yea, it is normal for you to feel that way and it is good that you recognize it is just your hormones going crazy because of being a teenager.

Its alright to fall in love with a teacher. Its normal for your age, your not the first girl that has ever had such thoughts about their teachers. Your in puberty so like you said your hormones are going all over. Just try to distract yourself to something else. You can get in trouble if you do, do something with him. A teacher wouldn't get the same thoughts about being worried being seen with a student alone because he is a teacher that is tutoring or helping a fellow student. Its normal for a student to be sometimes alone with teachers because they ask for help or advice. If he is married than stay out? Idk what to say to that. Just take care!

Now, we all know our imaginations are better than any SFX a Hollywood studio can create, but, sometimes, Hollywood and the TV studios do come close and we get to see some cool stuff on screen. To that end, we here at SF Signal put our collective heads together and came up with our list of the coolest scenes in science fiction film and television. Now, 'scene' in this context can be anywhere from a couple of seconds to pushing ten minutes; 'cool' also enjoys a similar flexible meaning, covering the bases from all-out battles to more intimate, personal settings. As with any list, your feelings will, most likely, not coincide with ours.

cMZEmpp0aa	I honestly thing the best ways to improve your own writing are to get lots of practice and lots of feedback. I'm assuming you're going to get more practice than you could ever want since you're in college. For the feedback, I think you should consider looking into something like getting a tutor, visiting your school's writing center, and/or setting up some sort of paper exchange with a good writer in one of your classes (approach your professor and ask for help with this -- they usually know who the good writers are and might be able to find a way to put you in touch with them).|`|4K6lSxMPaa	On Writing by Stephen King is a good
933XLRGCaa	Like you said it depends on the school, and also if you're going to be living in a dorm or on your own.  Usually, dorms provide their own school desk, chair, and bed.  There is also usually a set of drawers and a closet.<br>  <br>  So basically, you need everything else.  A partial list: bedsheets, pillow, clothes, hangars, quarters for laundry machine, refrigerator, food,  mirror, bath items, lamp, hamper/place for dirty clothes, bulletin/white board, trashcan, cleaning supplies, etc.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you can call the school residency director or someone like that and get more detail about what to expect. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7rp50tUBaa	Umm you have to take a notebook and bag i don't have to tell you that. Get a dictionary if your english is not that good because college english is hard. But I believe that you speak english good. Get a recorder in case if your professor goes too fast you can record him and when you go home you can listen again to what he or she said. Bring your schadule of classes. And money of course. I think thats all|`|FCwtMDBSaa	you need a notebook for every class, a recorder, a calender, an alarm clock, emergency cash, and everything else you will find out depending to your situation|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Take what you use at home (aside from a bed and dresser if it's being provided)...<br>  <br>  If you don't plan on using something while at school (say your bike... or stereo... then leave it at home).
BxTAfd2baa	A good thing for you all to work on would be a Rube Goldberg machine.  Then, when it is done, sell tickets to see it in action during your reading/activity period.  (At our high school, we have a reading/activity period where, occasionally, people will sell tickets to things like a womanless beauty pageant.  I don't know if you have one at your school, but if you do, I'm sure this will be a really successful and fun fundraiser)
eIQ5T2amaa	I went to the link and can honestly say I have no idea what that weirdo is talking about. I gave your comment a thumbs-up, because I, like you, are white and proud of it. I hate it that we (white people) are being punished for things our ancestors did. Why should I (I've never owned a slave) appologize to some random black guy (never been a slave). It just doesn't make any sense. And "dead human flesh." That's just stupid!

She'll get around to it.  She's obviously pretty busy.|`|Mdk7DmiAaa	Technically there is no rule to provide anything back to a student, especially in college.  Likely you will get a midterm grade and final grade after the term.  Otherwise you have very little in the way to demand anything.  <br>  <br>  As a person knowledgeable about special accommodations, none of those will be allowed in your future work, I suggest you start taking exams and such in the nominal way.  Otherwise you will be ill prepared for the 'real' world outside of academia and the protections of 504/IDEA regulations.<br>  ______________________________________<br>  In response....<br>  <br>  I believe that I did discuss 504 and IDEA, and my Master’s degree in Education makes me more than qualified for the topic.  The law specifically states REASONABLE accommodations.  From this whinny post I can see that you expect well more than what the average would consider reasonable. <br>  <br>  I am a person myself with difficulties.  I have both dyslexia and dysgraphia, Yet no amount of accommodations would be granted to me as a TEACHER, nor college lecturer.  Neither should they be granted to students, so work harder and learn coping skills.  Also, it would be nice if you would check your spelling of accommodations.  If this tirade is indicative of your attitude towards academia--whereby you feel entitled to special treatment just because you are different--no wonder the instructor is not inclined to be speedy.|`|FkFEsI8Naa	Hi,<br>  I also think that, at first it is not good to tell the head of department.

Even teachers are not perfect. if this is the first let it go if this is something that continues then i'd say by all means ask for help higher up.|`|l8tmWJw0aa	It is too bad that your teacher seems to be taking a while to get you your score.  You do have a right to know how you are doing in her class.  As a teacher I try to have a turn around time (the time from when I get the paper from the students to grading it and giving it back to the students) to a day or two.  <br>  Two weeks is a long time to wait, especially when you want to know what you got.  <br>  It seems like you have taken the proper course of action, emailing her yesterday... or when you did recently.  Wait about two days, and then go and talk to her in person.<br>  <br>  There are a Million reasons why she hasn't gotten it back to you and really she does not have to tell you why it is taking her so long.  That is part of her personal life that she does not have to inform her students about.  She could be very busy grading things for another class, teaching/preparing for another class or more classes, if she does researching as many professors do, she could be busy with that, maybe there was a recent death in her family that she's having to deal with, or she has a sick family member or friend, or maybe she's just lazy and keeps forgetting that she has to grade this exam (since the others were done on the computer, she has gotten used to them being done for her and forgets that she has this paper test to do).  <br>  <br>  I'm sure that she's not lying to you on purpose, but she does not need to inform you about her personal life.  Be patient, as you have been for waiting two weeks, she will let you know your grade.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oU1lKgIPaa	Ask to see the actual test, to see if she even has it. What if she lost it? That would be negligence on her part, and it will land her in tremendous trouble. True, she might really be that busy but this is an exam. It's not fair to you to have to wait that long.

TOPJybbsaa	Which is better depends on your career goals. The MBA is a general broad degree that prepares students for high level management positions. MBA students study accounting, finance, marketing, statistics, management, economics, strategy, policy, leadership, and similar courses. The MBA is not like an MS that concentrates in one field and prepares students for staff positions. MBA programs offer concentrations in various fields, but this amounts only to 2-3 elective courses in the second year. Students develop an interest in some subjects more than others, so they tend to select a concentration in the subject of their interest. This happens in the second year of the program, so you have plenty of time to decide. Also the school can advise you whether recruiters in your area are looking for certain concentrations or want broadly educated candidates.<br>  <br>  Consult the Official MBA Guide. It's a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications. You can see lists of top 40 schools ranked by starting salaries of graduates, GMAT scores, and other criteria.

CCkeHYw7aa	Some of the answers here I have read are completely wrong.<br>  If you are 'emo' you exaggerate every tiny bad thing that happens to you. An emo would pretend that their life is **** even though there is really nothing wrong with it. Just because someone self-harms, it is not fair to label them as emo. If they cut themselves and go around showing it off and whinging, go ahead, it's likely that they only did it for attention. But if they cut themselves and hid it from everyone so that it was their own private thing, they probably have a lot of crap going on in their life and used it as an escape.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	EMOtional<br>  It's an abbreviation<br>  Emo people hate life and cut themselves to ignore their problems and think about the horrible pain.

JOXQrsw0aa	University of Colorado at Boulder is a world class university. The others are not in the same league. <br>  <a href="http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(...</a><br>  The reason these rankings look quite different than US News is because US News does not consider quality of the faculty as a factor in their undergraduate rankings.  Their factors bias their rating heavily in favor of private institutions. Outside the US, all the world's great universities are public. This private university bias that US News has fostered in the US with their rankings over the past quarter of a century  does not exist. <br>  Honestly,  I would suggest majoring in Economics and supplementing it with  the classes needed to sit for the CPA exam in whichever state you intend to live. 27 states have gone to a 150 unit requirement for the CPA exam, but no state requires a major in accounting. The exam is the same in every state,  only the unit requirement to sit for the exam and for the license differ. For instance, here in California, the requirements to sit for the CPA exam with a 120 unit degree are 24 units in accounting and 24 units in business related subjects.  All economics classes are considered business related subjects. The required units can be taken after the degree is conferred. With 150 units, the experience requirement for the license is one year instead of the normal 2 years. These requirements differ by state.  No one is going to hire anyone with a BS in Finance for the same types of jobs as an MBA in Finance. Many top MBA programs prefer not to have students with a BS in Business, Finance, Accounting etc. It is considered too narrow and technical of an undergraduate education and much of the same material covered in an MBA program is included. Having a background in Economics will allow you to see the big picture. A CPA often functions as the role of a financial advisor and it is very useful to have the ability to have a certain level of Economic knowledge. Consider that very few of the most prestigious universities that attract recruiters from blue chip investment banks and management consultants offer undergrad business degrees. Only Penn in the Ivy League. Not Stanford. Not Chicago. But these are the schools they do a lot of hiring from. So, guess which major gets hired most frequently. Also might want to look into the CFA program.<br>  <a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/cfaprog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfainstitute.org/cfaprog/</a><br>  Econ and Accounting are  a great background. Most candidates have trouble with the financial accounting portions of the level 1 exam. Also suggest taking a course in federal taxation personal and corporate if  both are offered. Very useful and eye opening courses. Most of the lobbying in DC is concerned with preserving or expanding some section of the tax code. Back to Colorado-Boulder. Accounting is accounting.  It is pretty much the same wherever it is taught. To my knowledge, none of these schools are noted for Finance or Accounting so the only basis anyone is going to judge the overall education and degree is the overall reputation of the university. If having a recognized degree around the world is important choose Boulder. If some other factor such as small class size or geographic factors or cost are important chose whichever school meets the criteria. <br>  Good Luck!

t4B4hMARaa	My high school has never done an attractive yearbook. They tend to go towards themes that are too simple, for example 'black and white' that have no interesting theme that they can carry through the book. This is an instant recipe for dull. <br>  However, my best friend's high school had a great theme. They did the whole book to look like a laptop. The cover itself looked like the top and bottom (complete with hyper realistic vents drawn onto the bottom) and then each page looked like a web page or a file, or 'my documents'. Even though it was a simple printed theme, it looked very real and very cool. When I first saw it I was blown away. I though that she had gotten a real laptop. <br>  The school that she goes to is super low budget dirt poor. 70% of the students are below poverty rate, so it can be done at any school. <br>  This isn't necessarily that you should do but it's a great example. The theme doesn't have to be something hyper-reminiscent and sappy like 'memories' that will have no real design to tie throughout the book. The yearbook design at my friend's school was also explained in that we are the first generation that is wired to technology all the time, without blinking an eye. The fact that the book looked like technology was just a little reminder of what we started in our time in high school. <br>  Think out of the box! It's bound to be something super exciting if you do.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	UNITY<br>  <br>  ONE<br>  <br>  BEING TOGETHER|`|vNOxGgasaa	city<br>  travel<br>  friendship<br>  colors<br>  animals?<br>  <br>  haha im not quite sure sorry, hope i helped?

Ftkr9jqYaa	In Dansy Senna's essay, "The Color of Love," and Meghan Daum's essay, "Virtual Love," there are many different themes. The most obvious theme would be the subject of love, as both essay titles include the word.  Love is a certain high a person may have. He or she may feel on top of the world when they seem to find, in their opinion, their soul mate. But, as with all the highs come the lows. Someone can feel above the clouds, but can also feel below the ground. Disappointments come when high expectations are not met.<br>  <br>  In Daum's case it starts with her opening up an e-mail one day with the subject line saying, "Is this the real megham daum?" Over the course of a few weeks she develops an unexplainable affection with the man behind the screen name PFSlider. Later she finds out that his real name is Pete and he lives in California. She starts to check her e-mail ferociously. Every time she has a new message her mood elevates, and when she doesn't see anything she becomes sad. <br>  <br>  After awhile she agrees to meet Pete on one of his business trips to New York. The first impression is a pleasant one, but there is something about him that she just can't explain. She tries to like him but she isn't safely behind her computer typing an e-mail to PFSlider. She's on a date with Pete, and everything he's saying goes in one ear and out the other. "Instead of blaming him for my disappointment, I blamed the earth itself, the invasion of roommates and ringing phones into the immaculate communication that PFSlider and I created." She knew that this relationship was just not going to work.  Despite the many flirtatious email exchanges and telephone conversations with this 29-year-old man who admired her writings in The New Yorker, Daum realized that they had both been seduced into a false, virtual intimacy by the courtship ritual, but that their relationship was too ersatz to extend any further.<br>  <br>  Whereas Megan Daum has a virtual affair with another caucasian, Danzy Senna describes her mixed racial heritage in "The Color of Love."  Senna discusses age and ignorance in an attempt to justify her own grandmother's racial prejudice.  Whereas Daum's love was virtual, romantic, innovent, and temporal, Senna's love between herself and her grandmother is familial, life-long, and tinged with prejudice.

In her eyes u prolly were obsessive, and what you may think was flirting, was just conversation. But if she really did like you, depending upon what happened to make yall, "just friends", she prolly still likes you, the fact that you decided to stop talking to her just because she wanted to be only friends was a little childish though, i reccomend evaluating that again, you may regret that one day when you get a little older :) Hope i helped some|`|H40987QIaa	Ha I think this person will find out that women are crazy sooner than that.  Maybe you two 'flirted' or whatever, and maybe she 'pretending' this or that but that doesn't mean shiz man.  Get nakie and do the horizontal with her, until then the rest is just whatever.  If your friends are like, ZOMG then you don't need those folks.

8pIGQdybaa	I assume you are referring to year-round homeschooling. I homeschooled year-round when my children were younger and didn't realize that other children were getting summer breaks. At that point, we were probably only doing around two hours of "formal" schooling daily, so it wasn't a problem. The advantages were that we could take a longer winter break without worry, it kept us in a good routine, and I didn't have to bother with a beginning of the year review. As they got older and realized their friends had breaks, I caved on the formal schooling during the summer, but I did require them to continue reading (fiction, magazines, whatever interested them), and we took up more time with practical skills (they each had to plan and cook one meal per week; they were free to do odd summer jobs to earn some money; they pursued hobbies) and we used some of our extra time going to museums and taking educational field trips (under the guise of fun family day-trips).<br>  <br>  I hope that helps some!

Try seeing if you could find out which professor is teaching it and look on ratemyprofessor.com to see what other students say about it. Usually those classes are hard to do over the summer but if you're dedicated enough and have a good teacher to help than you should be fine. Usually though, I would take a sort of easy class over the summer because I really don't pay attention during summer courses (it's the summer! That's vacation time!!).

Beyond Fort Worth they would have to deal with crossing the Red River into Indian Territory. Between 1866 and 1890 more than four million head of cattle were trailed through Fort Worth which was soon known as “Cowtown” and had its own disreputable entertainment district several blocks south of the Courthouse area that was known all over the West as “Hell’s Half Acre”. <br>  When the railroad finally arrived in 1876, Fort Worth became a major shipping point for livestock.  This prompted plans in 1887 for the construction of the Union Stockyards about two and one half miles north of the Tarrant County Courthouse. It went into full operation about 1889.<br>  Because the Union Stockyards company lacked the funds to buy enough cattle to attract local ranchers, President Mike C. Hurley invited a wealthy Boston capitalist Greenleif Simpson to Fort Worth in hopes that he would invest in the Union Stock Yards. When Simpson arrived on the heels of heavy rains and a railroad strike, more cattle than usual had accumulated in the pens. Seeing this, he decided that Fort Worth represented a good market and made plans to invest.  Simpson invited other investors to join him, one of whom was a Boston neighbor, Louville V. Niles whose primary business was meatpacking. On April 27, 1893, Simpson bought the Union Stockyards for $133,333.33 and changed the name to the Fort Worth Stockyards Company.<br>  It soon became apparent that instead of shipping to other markets to process the cattle, it would be much more desirable to keep more of the business in Fort Worth by having local packing plants. A search began to lure major packers to the City.  By about 1900, after much work by local businessmen, both Armour & Co. and Swift & Co. were persuaded to build plants adjacent to the Stockyards.<br>  <br>  Construction began in 1902, but not until after the exact site of each plant was decided by a flip of the coin. Armour won the toss and selected the northern site and Swift began to build on the southern tract which was the site of the original Livestock Exchange and Hotel.  Swift & Co. received an unexpected financial bonus when a large gravel pit was found on the southern site which was ultimately used in the construction of both plants.<br>  The new Livestock Exchange Building in its present location, as well as the pens and the barns were also started in 1902. The new building was designed to house the many livestock commission companies, Telegraph offices, railroad offices and other support businesses.<br>  While construction was underway, the Fort Worth Stock Yards Company which now included the two meat packers, incorporated much of the area north of the river adjacent to the Stockyards as North Fort Worth. In 1909 the City of Fort Worth annexed the new city with the exception of the Stockyards and the packing house property.<br>  Business boomed with the opening of the packing houses.  Armour and Swift bought 265,279 cattle, 128,934 hogs and 40,160 sheep which brought over 6 million dollars into the local economy. A livestock market that drew local farmers and ranchers had finally arrived in Fort Worth.<br>  The Livestock Exchange Building became known as “The Wall Street of the West”.<br>  Because of the success of the Stockyards, the necessity for an indoor show facility became obvious.  In 1907 construction began on a grand Coliseum which was completed in just 88 working days, in time for the grand opening of the Feeders & Breeders Show. The Coliseum which is today known as the Cowtown Coliseum, was the home of the first indoor rodeo although it was used for many cultural, social, agricultural and religious events as well.<br>  The Stockyards continued to prosper in spite of droughts and floods.  In 1911 after two disastrous fires that killed large number of the penned livestock the yards were rebuilt with an eye toward fireproofing by using as much noninflammable material as possible.<br>  In 1911 a new town, Niles City, was chartered and grew up around the Stockyards and packinghouse properties. Niles City was known as “the richest little city in the world” with a property value of 30 million dollars. In 1923 Fort Worth annexed this area.<br>  At the height of World War I in 1917, the Fort Worth Stockyards was the largest horse and mule market in the world. Military officers from Allied countries came to purchase the animals to support their war efforts.  Total sales of all livestock continued to grow during the war years.<br>  During World War II, the Fort Worth Stockyards processed 5,277,496 head of livestock making 1944 the peak year of the entire operation. In later years sales at the Stockyards began to decline and by 1969 they had dwindled to 1,045,158 head. By 1986, sales reached an all-time low of 57,181 animals.<br>  There were many reasons for the decline of the Fort Worth Stockyards but one of the largest factors was the rise of the trucking industry on the newly paved roads after World War II. Because of their lower operating costs and their greater flexibility, much of the advantage that railroads had in bulk shipping was lost. The market moved to the shipper with the creation of local livestock auctions and feedlots. It was a whole new way of marketing livestock. Not only was Fort Worth affected, all the major plackers in the United States struggled with this new way to market livestock.<br>  Both Armour and Swift had huge outdated plants that were straddled with risings costs and wages and administrative expenses. Armour was the first to close their Fort Worth plant in 1962 with Swift hanging on until 1971. Partial demolition followed over the years after several fires.<br>  The unique Armour office building was lost, but the classic Swift headquarters building was put to use as the home of a popular restaurant.<br>  While local auctions continued to be held in the Stockyards, the volume diminished until it was unprofitable to continue. This vibrant part of Fort Worth history fell on hard times as the Stockyards area continued its decline.<br>  In 1976, the North Fort Worth Historical Society founded by Charlie and Sue McCafferty, was chartered to ensure that Fort Worth's’ livestock heritage would be preserved.  Since then, the Society has worked to promote the history of one of the greatest livestock and meatpacking industries in the country.<br>  The Fort Worth Stockyards National Historical District was also established in 1976 and many of the area’s landmarks have been restored including the Livestock Exchange Building and the Coliseum.  Recently, the historic Swift & Co. headquarters building underwent an almost total restoration.<br>  In 1989 the North Fort Worth Historical Society opened the Stockyards Museum in the Exchange Building which now hosts many thousands of visitors from all over the world each year. Its facilities are expanding to handle the ever increasing number of visitors.<br>  Weekly livestock auctions ceased many years ago, but the Stockyards continues to host special breed events and sales including Longhorn auctions. Many thousand of head of cattle are still sold in the Stockyards every week via video/satellite sales originating in the Exchange Building. The livestock legacy lives on.<br>  Today the Fort Worth Stockyards Historic District is one of Texas’ most popular tourist destinations. Many events of all kinds are held every year, new businesses and lodgings have been established adding to the history and fun that is the Fort Worth Stockyards...|`|KEoxYNqOaa	wat do u need help in? maybe i can help.

gvtjyrsBaa	Don't worry about it being too long. In fact, I think the end of your essay was cut off ... it ends "I mean I do have some particular newer songs and bands I listen to and some are even ..." (good? entertaining? talented?) <br>  <br>  The part of it we can see, however, is about 900 words--a good length for a moderately important newspaper editorial, although academic essays are from 2,000 to 5,000 words. So DON'T WORRY. It's not too long!<br>  <br>  I didn't realize you were in 8th grade until I read your additional details. I thought you were a very bright 10th grader. So, you've obviously got a real talent for writing, and I imagine you'll be able to make a living from it one day--you'll probably get famous if you keep it up. So keep writing! <br>  <br>  Your thesis is that today's rock music is terrible compared to classic rock of the 1960s and '70s. <br>  <br>  I'm curious: Do you actually believe this? Or are you taking that stance for the sake of argument? It's a great thesis providing lots of material to write about--I love it, in fact. Don't change it! You can do great things with it.<br>  <br>  (I'm not accusing you of anything bad, by the way--in fact, the ability to write an argument in favor of a position that you don't personally agree with shows great intellectual prowess, and is usually not studied until college, so I applaud you if that is the case. I only hope that you're not motivated to take this position simply out of a desire to please a teacher, parent or some other authority figure.)<br>  <br>  Now: I do have some constructive criticism. <br>  <br>  It is not necessary or desirable in an essay to use phrases such as "I think," "I feel," and "I believe." The reader already knows that you're expressing your own opinion. In fact, it's best not to refer to yourself at all. Make bold statements. Instead of saying "I don't particularly like Kelly Clarkson," just come right out and say, "Kelly Clarkson is a talentless hack"--and then back that statement up with evidence.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is actually kind of sad, but it's a lesson learned by every writer, no matter how great or widely published: When you come right down to it, there's no reason the reader should care what you, personally, think. (Frankly, the writer is lucky that anybody is interested enough to read it at all!) Even if you've got a PhD, a Pulitzer and a Nobel Prize, the reader doesn't know you, and there's no particular reason he or she should value your words, no matter how strongly you believe them.<br>  <br>  Every time you refer to yourself, it reminds the reader that you're just a regular person. If you want to reader to really believe what you're saying, use persuasion and evidence instead. <br>  <br>  In fact, I'd recommend you do a rewrite--and this time, vow never to use the words "I" or "me."<br>  <br>  Instead of this: <br>  <br>  "Now, I am one of the many rock advocates constantly looking for newer material and bands to listen to. I must admit its pretty hard when it comes to newer rock music- you have to look for it sometimes due to lack of media coverage." <br>  <br>  Try something like this: <br>  <br>  "Innovative and powerful music can still be found, even in this soulless era of corporate-sponsored, profit-driven rock. Lightweight pop musicians sell their souls for publicity, so they're easy to find. It's the rockers with real talent and integrity who remain elusive, and the discerning listener must be willing to invest the effort necessary to seek out the best of today's music." <br>  <br>  OK, maybe that seems a little pompous. But notice it didn't say "I" even once?!<br>  <br>  Anyway, you're shaping up into a good writer. Your essay will be excellent if you just take the time to read/write through it once or twice more--and think of it from the perspective of the reader. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Not in every city|`|89fd4acf51ae06a031b5818923fa2dfdaa	The indications for intestinal transplantation include short-bowel syndrome with complications associated with parenteral nutrition, irreversible intestinal failure, and end-stage liver disease for combined liver and small-intestine transplantation. Patients with congenital mucosal disorders, chronic pseudo-obstruction of intestine, and locally invasive tumors at the base of the intestine may also require intestinal transplantation. Transplant options include isolated intestinal (cadaveric or living-related) and multivisceral transplantation (combined liver and multivisceral). <br>  <br>  Patient survival and graft survival rates have improved with the introduction of tacrolimus (FK506)–based immunosuppression used in combination with decontamination protocols, antibiotic regimens, and antiviral measures against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Isolated intestinal grafts have achieved 1-year patient survival rates of up to 93% and offer patients a viable alternative to parenteral nutrition, but the survival rates of these grafts still remain inferior to those of solid-organ transplants in the medium and long term. Currently, the short-term success of intestinal transplantation depends on the long-term delivery of profound immunosuppression, which can lead to infections, malignancies (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder [PTLD]), and drug toxicity.<br>  <br>  History of the Procedure: Although Lillehei et al reported the first case of bowel transplantation in humans in October 1967, Alexis Carrel was the first one to perform a small-intestine transplantation in an animal model. Before 1970, 8 clinical cases of small-intestine transplantation were reportedly performed worldwide; maximum graft survival time was 79 days, and all patients died of technical complications, sepsis, or rejection. <br>  <br>  The most significant advance to contribute to the development of intestinal transplantation was the introduction of tacrolimus, in 1990, as reported by the Starzl group. Up through 1993, 59 patients underwent some form of small-intestine transplantation and had a 1-year graft survival rate of 60%. The Starzl group (Reyes, 1998) reported that in 55 children (28 girls and 27 boys; median age, 3.2 y) who underwent small-intestine transplantations, patient survival rates were 55% and graft survival rates were 52%. Greater understanding of the unique immunologic properties of the intestine has furthered the advancement of small-intestine transplantation. <br>  <br>  You will find much more by clicking the site below.

Q5EftYrpaa	You study these things to prepare you for life. When you figure out what you want to pursue in the future, you'll probably pick something that is in either the fields of science, foreign language, math, literature, or social science. If you never took social science classes, you probably wouldn't be successful in getting an education in social science if that was your major. Social sciences along with history are really my FAVORITE subject and whatever I pursue in the future will have something to do with either singing (I'm a singer) or social studies (economics, psychology). If you don't decide to do anything to which social science is relevant, then quite frankly, it probably isn't that important. However, in life, people would wonder why you're not knowledgeable in discussing things that have to do with social sciences. Hopefully you do pursue something that has to do with social science, because its far more important than math, because every mathematical concept is developed by man and for man, but in the end, nothing really happens (architecture is OKAY). Social science deals with people. English is good too.

You could find ones that the DMV recommends at their site or by giving them a call, or probably listed in their qualifications on their website and/or in the phone book's yellow pages.  Check it out.  But, to my knowledge you would not have to take one "approved" by the DMV.<br>  <br>  Your parents are fully capable of teaching you themselves.  Get a copy of the driver's manual from the DMV, and start with that.  Study, study, study.  Then, once you have your driver's permit,  you can start driving lessons.  Your parents can give you those as well.  In addition, you might have your parents look up driver's education courses that are available to order.  <br>  <br>  Last, check with your insurance company.  I know several offer their own courses for teen drivers, and if yours does not they can atleast recommend some sources.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

8zMh3QKWaa	Yes, a "major" can be any discipline like Math, History, Economics, Chemistry, etc. In order to successfully be eligible for graduation in the US you need to complete a certain amount of classes related to your major. The requirements vary from college to college. For example, my university (Columbia) requires two courses in Math, one in Statistics, and nine in Economics in order for me to graduate with a degree in Economics. This does not include the unrelated "liberal arts" classes (literature, arts, music) I must take in addition to my Economics major.<br>  <br>  A "minor" represents other interests you have besides your major, but it does not require as many classes as a major. Think of it as a mini-major (a minor!).<br>  <br>  When you "double major" you are basically taking on a second major (major is described above).<br>  <br>  All colleges require a "major" as the minimum requirement to graduate. But you do not have to declare a minor or a double-major. Those are optional, for more ambitious students.|`|AA11045576	Good answers.  Write the schools of your choice or interest.  Request a catalog. Read and re-read the catalog.  All of your questions will be answered. If you have a question and can't find an answer, write the admissions officer of that school. Schools today are struggling to find students. They will welcome your interest.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Major is simply the main subject of study, with a degree being awarded in that area.  Minor is a secondary area of concentrated study, but has far less coursework in the subject than a major does. You do not need to minor at all, most do not, and if you do they can come from different departments.  You of course must have a major (else what would you be doing in college?).  Some colleges allow for a double major and that is simply taking two main fields of study that some students elect to do.|`|QB9szNYMaa	Your research should be conducted in conjunction with a knowledgeable University/College affiliate at your school of choice, as answers to all your questions vary from school to school.
gQEtEtLQaa	I think if I were doing a project on the English Civil War I would probably focus on one of the major battles like Edgehill, Naseby or Marston Moor.  You could examine the politics and policies of the opposing sides and maybe some of the generals involved.  You could also look at the events that preceded the battle and the repercussions of the aftermath as well as what took place in the battle itself and the tactics that were used.|`|SHNYP6Xpaa	Well first we could look at the concepts of checks and balances that the king used to keep control of the country and how that balanced with parliament use of 'checks' to control the king.  And how a failure of checks and balances lead to war.<br>  <br>  Also you could look at how Oliver Cromwell's republic was even more tyrannical than Charles the First's monarchy. Which basically is "Cromwell decided the king was a tyrant, so he killed him and anyone else who didn't agree with his methods of government."|`|cYgJQDQSaa	Maybe you could focus on a particular battle, or even a siege.

If needed they will have an aid for the student.  If this does not work, then next is a different room separate from the classroom.  In most cases this is where many severely handicapped children end up.  Usually these children do not end up in a different school or a school for the handicapped because it is cheeper for the parents and the school.  I substituted in a classroom with severely handicapped children, several who can not speak, have very little control of the movements, and can do nothing for themselves.  They sit in a wheelchair all day and if they could sleep all day.<br>  <br>  The women working with these children were amazing, even though many have no college experience (which you don't need to be an Educational Technician-a teacher's aid).  Basically from the outside it looks like these children are being dropped off at school to be baby-sat and to give the parents a break... which mind you, did not have jobs and are living off of the government.<br>  <br>  However, these children are still capable of learning.  After four days in the room I noticed that one of these children were using pictures to say when they wanted more food, they had to point to it and would not be given anymore to eat until they did.  This is probably more than what they parents were doing at home.  <br>  <br>  These children CAN learn and need to learn the basics on how to take care of themselves and learn about the world.  They may always be dependent on others, but they does not mean they should not be taught.|`|0011Smdtaa	Because everybody has the right to be educated.... That saying I'm not sure I agree with the tax payers money being spent on countless teacher aid hours.  Schools can be babysitting services for some children who are not even being taught.  Perhaps parents of handicap or mentally disabled children should be facing their responsibilities and educating their offspring themselves with the love and patience they have been given and not palming their dearly loved children off to an overstretched education system.|`|ORonhAuvaa	So that they can be as independent as possible. Most teachers end up teaching these kids to eat and use the toilet. Most people don't think this is important, but if you are the one changing an adult diaper, you would surely appreciate this.<br>  <br>  The amount of money that goes into these kids is enormous  compared to the money that is spent on children with learning disabilities, who with a little more help, could actually contribute to society with a little more help. Instead they drop out in great numbers.<br>  <br>  But that is the dilemma we are facing in this country. We passed a law that said each child is to be provided with a free and appropriate education. So who actually judges what is and isn't appropriate? Therein lies the rub.|`|S5qDfrTeaa	so that they can stand on themselves when there is no one to help them. educating a needy person is good and social service.

d0c27cb965d282bda6d18370f8cdd49baa	Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit a beam of electromagnetic radiation. The observed periods of their pulses range from 1.4 milliseconds to 8.5 seconds.[clarification needed]. The radiation can only be observed when the beam of emission is pointing towards the Earth. This is called the lighthouse effect and gives rise to the pulsed nature that gives pulsars their name. Because neutron stars are very dense objects, the rotation period and thus the interval between observed pulses are very regular. For some pulsars, the regularity of pulsation is as precise as an atomic clock. Pulsars are known to have planets orbiting them, as in the case of PSR B1257+12. Werner Becker of the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik said in 2006, "The theory of how pulsars emit their radiation is still in its infancy, even after nearly forty years of work.<br>  <br>  The radiation from pulsars passes through the interstellar medium (ISM) before reaching Earth. Free electrons in the warm (8000 K), ionized component of the ISM and H II regions affect the radiation in two primary ways. The resulting changes to the pulsar's radiation provide an important probe of the ISM itself.<br>  <br>  Due to the dispersive nature of the interstellar plasma, lower-frequency radio waves travel through the medium slower than higher-frequency radio waves. The resulting delay in the arrival of pulses at a range of frequencies is directly measurable as the dispersion measure of the pulsar.<br>  hsj

So for the first problem x=1, y=2, and m=4.  Plug these numbers into the equation and solve for b.  You end up with b= -2.  So draw your 4 qaudrants and place a circle on the point of (1,2) and a second circle on the y-intercept of -2.  Then draw a line!  You could do the same for problem #2 but remember a line with a slope of zero is always horizontal.  Good luck!|`|19Co95eKaa	Find the coordinate point first.

069a91495e9103e06deb265a5edf5c4caa	The colonial Americans had a slogan - no taxation without representation. Britain at the time considered colonies as assets that could be milked for revenue. If a colony such as America had representation in the British Parliament, they would be considered not as a possession of the British Empire but as a part of Britain itself.<br>  <br>  If America was represented in Parliament, they would have to be taxed at the same rate as the rest of Britain instead of the excessive rates the King was demanding of them. Also, to give America representation would set a dangerous precedent which many of the rest of Britain's colonies around the world might demand for their countries.|`|c3056d05b00d433a6f73755e0a1f3757aa	The British earned their livelyhood through taxing the poor people in the colonies. For example, they even went to the extent of taxing the sale of salt in India. Salt being the bare essential ingredient of the day to day life and the Brits making no effort whatsoever in improving the quality of life, such taxation led to unrest and uprise against the british rule. The salt was manufactured by the people of india and used by them with no support from the british. This interference was one of the main reasons for crisis faced the british authority.|`|a281efbf1b59970582e1c2452cc46f5caa	I'm not really sure, but my guess would be; since so many people left Britain to the United States, they weren't too happy, they wanted some sort of power over what are, in essence, their people. Putting taxes on America like the pointless Stamp Act, and all that was just a way of making America suffer for leaving.

xxd03wBOaa	Science, maths and english are always ones which give you more choices but if you look at some university websites, they tell you which subjects are best to take for the widest range of courses. I would pick two subjects you like and 2 you're good at. I chose to do maths, biology, chemistry, physics and critical thinking. Biology and maths are pretty easy whilst the other two sciences aren't and critical thinking is easy too and though some universities don't accept it, it still gives you UCAS points.|`|mj52nmKtaa	well psychology is supposed to be pretty damn boring! but I dunno what you are really into.

Some people sign up with an online version of public school; that’s really technically not “homeschool,” since you're counted as public school student and you have to have regular contact with teachers, submit work and tests, etc. The dirty little secret here is that the school district gets to keep the federal funds for you, as you’re a public school student this way. (Quite obviously, your school district will like this option best. Often when one queries the school as to the options available for “homeschool,” the school administrators will smile sweetly and mention just such an arrangement, conveniently omitting the rest of your options. This “lie by omission” quietly implies that this is the one and only way “homeschooling is done.” There’s a quite a debate in the homeschooling community about whether or not this constitutes an effort by the educational bureaucracy to redefine the meaning of homeschool, and what effect that would have on legislation and regulation of more traditional homeschool. But I digress.)<br>  <br>  Other people may choose to buy materials from companies and enroll with online schools, but they're "independent" of the school districts, and they don't owe anyone a darned thing...their test scores (if any; few homeschoolers in the traditional sense are obligated to take state standardized tests) are their own business, as is the pace, order or depth at which they choose to go through the material. <br>  <br>  Other people make up their own curriculum, based on their own personal criteria.  Some states want you to keep a portfolio of material to prove you're doing something there at home, other states want you to submit your curriculum for the year for approval, others may require testing that could send you back to public or private school if you fall below a particular percentile...just in case. Again, depends on the state. <br>  <br>  Still other people endorse what they call "unschooling," and they throw out all books and tests altogether and simply follow what interests them. (See the writings of John Holt, or Google "unschooling" for more on that theory of education.) A good book for anyone over 12 years old is “The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education,” by Grace Llewellyn. Here’s an excerpt:<br>  <br>  "Did your guidance counselor ever tell you to consider quitting school? That you have other choices, quite beyond lifelong hamburger flipping or inner-city crack dealing? That legally you can find a way out of school, that once you're out you'll learn and grow better, faster, and more naturally than you ever did in school, that there are zillions of alternatives, that you can quit school and still go to A Good College and even have a Real Life in the Suburbs if you so desire? Just in case your counselor never told you these things, I'm going to. That's what this book is for."<br>  <br>  Even if you don’t hold with what the author has to say, the point of view she has is dramatically different and can be a great springboard to help you get in touch with what you believe school and learning should be like. As with many things, there’s a wide spectrum of “unschoolers,” as well. Many of them have a certain set of concepts they want their kids to get and don’t care HOW they get the information, while others take a much more laid-back approach and allow the student to set the list of concepts themselves...or not set one at all. All of these people will still consider themselves “unschoolers.”<br>  <br>  We personally use K12.com as “independents.” I know they have a high school curriculum, too. <br>  <br>  When it comes to quitting state schools, some states require you to send a letter to the school that notifies them that you will no longer be attending and that's that. In yet other states, a letter of notification is totally voluntary and you can simply empty your locker into a cardboard box (leave the textbooks!) spin on your heel and walk away, never to look back. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, your answer will depend on<br>  (A) The state you live in, and<br>  (B) How you will choose to homeschool|`|UFa29QyLaa	You have to ask your parents.

ccT5wEbcaa	I'm a 50 year old teacher and all I can say is "ewww". It is a sign of gross immaturity on the teacher's part.  As long as 'the line' is not crossed, there isn't anything to be done other than try to learn as best you can in this environment. However, if you find his behavior is interfering with his ability to teach the rest of the class--you may need to talk with another teacher or counselor (or parents) about this. You should be proud of the common sense and logic you are applying to this situation and be proud that SOMEONE (i.e. YOU) in that classroom has enough self-esteem to know what their job is. It is sad that this male teacher has to build his own ego by accepting the attention of underage students, and even sadder that the lesson these underage students are learning is that flirtation will get you further in life (boy, will that backfire when they get older and in the real world!).<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether you are stunning or have a face like a horse's backside, should be totally irrelevant to the learning environment maintained by your teacher. I am so sorry you are going through this. I wish I were in your school that I could help you with this problem.|`|VEScnfoHaa	Yes, I have seen teachers behaving in this way before.

It might seem to go hand in hand, but there is a difference.<br>  <br>  I think that sometimes teachers get caught up in the atmosphere of high school as well and want to re-live their youth...maybe make up for popularity that they never had when they were students. I taught with a young lady like this who was more interested in becoming "friends" with her students (both male and female) than actually instructing them. It then carried over to be my problem when they were passed on to junior English the following semester, but didn't know their butts from holes in the ground.<br>  <br>  I will say, in his defense, that it is hard to be a teacher, especially now that students seem to have more control than we do. I was once asked out by a student (yes, I said it) and was terrified as to what would come from me telling him "no." Would he brag to his friends about something happening that didn't for attention or spite? Would he become embarrassed and tell the world that I had done something inappropriate to him? It's just a very difficult position to be in.<br>  <br>  Clearly, you are focused on your education and I wish you nothing but the best. It's great to see that some students do actually have their heads on straight and care about getting an education.|`|vynCBykUaa	Actually yes i did. i have a counselor at my school that has a lot of "helpers" which are a lot of the preps.

e617d938bb79f39f4dcab638b17af120aa	The suffix "-esque" means "in the manner or style of" while the suffix "-ish" means "characteristic of."  Not much help there, huh?<br>  <br>  Grammatically these terms could be used interchangably.  However, one is usually a better choice over the other in common usage when viewed in conjuction with a particular antecedent.  For example, "boyish" is surely better than "boyesque," but "Picassoesque" wins over "Picassoish."<br>  <br>  From all my readings, in a context where the two words could be properly used interchangably,  "-ish" most often has a derogatory connotation while "-esque" is complementary.  E.g., "Ugh, that film was SO Brian DePalmaish."<br>  <br>  In the comparative sense, I also believe that "-ish" connotes more of a direct comparison, while "-esque" is used to indicate that the two things compared fall under the same classification or style.<br>  <br>  In the example you give, the term "Harry Potterish" to me suggests that the thing you are referring to is very similar to the movie/book, meaning perhaps that it also had a character who was a boy wizard, or perhaps a character who learned to be a wizard at a school.  However, if you had described it as being "Harry Potteresqe" I would have thought you meant it was a fantasy/magic movie aimed at a young audience.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, if you're talking about something artsy, use "-eque."  If it's a mundane comparison, use "-ish."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I hope you find it to be the best answer!|`|bzDO71VPaa	im sure there probably is some rules...but...as a general idea, you would use -ish in a situation where you are approximating (like with numbers: 600ish people) whereas you would use the suffix -esque in your example, where you are making a comparison

d1c66d8392e4e8a266c308bf49beee5faa	Six Sigma is a term describing a structured methodology applied to a given process. That process could be, software development or any standardized task which would benefit from an added component of quality assurance.<br>  <br>  "To achieve Six Sigma, a process must not produce more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. A Six Sigma defect is defined as anything outside (of) a customers specifications."<br>  <br>  The use of such a structured approach can be of enormous benefit to large companies running multiple large scale projects concurrently by reducing each process to a standardized approach thus saving considerable time of employees to achieve the desired result which equates to cost savings through both less man (or woman) hours as well as a better defined process which exposes vulnerabilities of a project much sooner allowing for correction and improvement of the process.|`|007a54d4d52043285b3f80f826543ae0aa	Six sigma is related with Quality management.It is widely used in manufacturing units by multi-national companies for quality supply of finished products..Any body can practice it , as it is you have to be devoted more on production and quality conscious.<br>  <br>  Japan is widely using six sigma tecnology to improve their quality performance.Also in defence it is used widely.|`|790bf50b51c590289ca91a3488b47ba7aa	<a href="http://www.isixsigma.com/sixsigma/six_sigma.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.isixsigma.com/sixsigma/six_si...</a><br>  <br>  Six Sigma is a methodology to manage process variations that cause defects, defined as unacceptable deviation from the mean or target; and to systematically work towards managing variation to eliminate those defects. The objective of Six Sigma is to deliver high performance, reliability, and value to the end customer. It was pioneered by Bill Smith at Motorola in 1986 and was originally defined as a metric for measuring defects and improving quality; and a methodology to reduce defect levels below 3.4 Defects Per (one) Million Opportunities (DPMO). Six Sigma has now grown beyond defect control.<br>  <br>  Six Sigma is a registered service mark and trademark of Motorola, Inc. Motorola has reported over US$17 billion in savings from Six Sigma to date.|`|a80c88dee1024577e7c2288ec54ca4b2aa	Six Sigma is a trademark owned by Motorola in connection with a training service it markets to large companies in a variety of industries under "Motorola University."  What they teach as SIx Sigma is a collection of business proesses and management systems by which companies reduce defects or errors in their operations and products, as well as a methodology for measuring those errors.  Motorola claims that practitioners of Six Sigma have saved their companies $17 billion to date as of early 2006.<br>  <br>  Like many management methods Six Sigma comes with a whole collection of tools, lingo, certifications, books, lectures, consulting, etc.  Although probably useful and valid -- it draws on many well-accepted, proven business practices -- it is sometimes accused of being unduly trendy and gimmicky, the latest business fad.  It has been around for approximately 20 years.<br>  <br>  As opposed to "excellence" trends that simply promote quality without measuring it, or "zero defects" trends that set unattainable targets, Six Sigma acknowledges that all businesses produce errors.  These may be manufacturing mistakes, measuring mistakes, management mistakes, malfunctions, missed deadlines, missed deliveries, etc.  Under Six Sigma these errors are quantified, with the goal being to reduce the number of unacceptable results to 3.4 per million.  To simplify things, if you buy a telephone from a company practicing Six Sigma, the chance of it being defective (or missing from the box, etc) is 3.4 per million.<br>  <br>  The name itself is derived from the notion of "sigma" (also called "standard deviation"), meaning difference from the mean in a set of random results that follow "normal distribution" (i.e. a "bell," or "gaussian" curve).  If you've ever had a statistics class or science lab you probably know what that is -- the "curve" that teachers use to grade students.  Most scores are in or near the middle of the curve (the mean).  The farther you go above and below the mean, the fewer and fewer data points you see.  If you graph the restults the shape looks like a bell with a rounded top and symmetrical sides that taper off rapidly but extend indefinitely.  There is a distance called "sigma" that describes how variable the results are, meaning how close most data points are to the average result.  Just under 68.3% are within one "sigma" from the mean; 95.5% are within two sigmas, 99.7% within three sigmas, and so on.  These are not arbitrary percentages; rather, they are a matter of mathematical certainty if the results are truly random.<br>  <br>  "Six Sigma" is used to evoke a business that controls its processes so tightly that there is almost no variation from one product to the next, where you would have to go six sigmas away from the mean before the product is defective.  <br>  <br>  Though it is a cool and instructive name, the name is more evocative than real.  For one, 3.4 per million is 4.5 sigmas from the mean, not six sigmas.  The difference is explained away by arbitrarily assigning the other 1.5 sigmas to something called "sigma shift," an uncertainty over measuring variability.  In other words, the number six is meaningless here and was probably chosen becuse it sounds good.<br>  <br>  A more serious issue is that in real life most things do not follow a true bell curve.  Instead of being randomly distributed they fall into buckets and clusters.  Even situations that are normally distributed near the mean usually succumb to a non-gaussian distributionf after two or three sigmas.  Imagine, for example, that Homer Simpson's nuclear power plant practices Six Sigma and wants to keep the power output from the plant at a constant level -- too much or too little and it trips circuit breakers and the plant has to shut down.  They target the acceptable risk at 3.4 days per million an implement the program.  This works pretty well, except that Homer Simpson is the pant safety manager and likes to sleep on the job.  When he does the plant overheats and power output drops to zero.  This happens about once a week.  Here, the power output is not a minor fluctuation around a mean number, but some chance of working an some chance of being zero -- two buckets rather than a bell curve.  That's how most things are in real life, so the terminology (and probably the whole Six Sigma method) breaks down when dealing with the Homer Simpsons of the world.<br>  <br>  Another conceptual problem is that 3.4 mistakes per million tries is not a realistic goal in most business situations.  If your product is fruit, it may be possible to reduce overripe strawberries to that level but the cost of doing so would be prohibitive.  On the other hand if your product is wire harnesses for passenger airplanes, one would hope for a much better consistency rate than that.<br>  <br>  If you're a company and want to put Six Sigma to use, contact Motorola.  If you're an individual, I suppose your opportunities are to become a trainer, to learn enough to become a consultant, or to specialize in one of the many management roles needed to implement a Six Sigma program (e.g. become a "black belt," as Motorola calls it).  This is strictly for big companies given how complex the program is and how many people are needed ro run it within a company.

Not to worry, this is totally normal and expected.<br>  <br>  Using a vibrator will not "loosen you up" because there is no insertion with a vibrator.

8f12e480917f47088c58cf3f8999df5faa	Using the example....from the problem you can tell that the tail wind helps the plane move faster.  Let's say the speed of the plane in still air is x, so the speed of the plane with the tail wind is equal to x+25.  The distance the plane travels is equal to (x+25)5, which is the speed of the plane times the number of hours the plane flew.  Now for the return flight, we know the wind is now working against the plane, so it reduces the plane's speed.  Therefore the speed on the return flight is x-25.  The distance traveled can be calculated by (x-25)6.  Since the flight to the destination and the return flight must be the equal, we can set the  distances equal to each other.<br>  <br>  (x+25)5 = (x-25)6<br>  5x + 125 = 6x - 150<br>  <br>  From there you can solve the problem.
AA10979064	What is Anthropology?<br>  <br>     <br>   <br>  Anthropology is the broad study of humankind around the world and throughout time.  It is concerned with both the biological and the cultural aspects of humans.  Included in anthropology are four main subdivisions:<br>  <br>  Biological (or Physical) Anthropology<br>  <br>  Mechanisms of biological evolution, genetic inheritance, human adaptability and variation, primatology, and the fossil record of human evolution.<br>  <br>  Cultural Anthropology<br>  <br>  Culture, ethnocentrism, cultural aspects of language and communication, subsistence and other economic patterns, kinship, sex and marriage, socialization, social control, political organization, class, ethnicity, gender, religion, and culture change.<br>  <br>  Archaeology<br>  <br>  Prehistory and early history of cultures around the world; major trends in cultural evolution; and techniques for finding, excavating, dating, and analyzing material remains of past societies.<br>  <br>  Linguistic Anthropology<br>  <br>  The human communication process focusing on the importance of socio-cultural influences; nonverbal communication; and the structure, function, and history of languages, dialects, pidgins, and creoles.|`|eb6c526d3f0ae2da79fc29957b11fc14aa	tell him to watch friends Ross was an anthropologist , I guess you work in a museum ,i guess with stuffed animals ..|`|AA11140637	it is the study of human kind, there clothes food habits, residential habits and all other stuff.|`|04991c8554fdb5f224b5abb482b798abaa	Anthropology is the study of humans in all times and places.<br>  <br>  In other words, it's a very very broad field. In the US, it's traditionally been divided (by Franz Boas) into four subfields: physical/biological anthropology, social/cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and anthropological archaeology.<br>  <br>  By the way, this question has been answered many many times on Yahoo Answers, so you might consider searching for already resolved questions on the topic.|`|1952ad9935f17fd1a2a47b17a8dcf1b0aa	Anthropology is the study of humanity. It is holistic in two senses: it is concerned with all humans at all times and with all dimensions of humanity. In principle, it is concerned with all institutions of all societies, but in practice anthropologists have tended to concentrate on the seemingly more "traditional" institutions, usages, and customs of non-Western, often tribal, societies. Anthropology is distinguished from other social-science disciplines by its emphasis on cultural relativity, in-depth examination of context, and cross-cultural comparisons. Some anthropologists have utilized anthropological knowledge to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in America, from the popular attacks on Victorianism of Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict through contemporary attacks on post-colonialism under the heading of postmodernism. Anthropology is methodologically diverse using both qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Ethnographies--intensive case studies based on field research-- have historically had a central place in the literature of the discipline.|`|4f6fe218f893db8c3e9b2265e844ce4eaa	why don't u look it up in the dictionary! or do an internet search!

If you're still stuck, email me and I have some basic materials I give the kids I tutor.  Bottom line - look at the flirty relationship the two have, and study the language; it's some of the wittiest Shakespeare wrote, making the two characters so very personable.  And go see a performance, or rent a video, if you can.  The Johnathan Miller very old BBC series video is excellent!  Good luck!

Estábamos en autobús, y era muy divertido.  En el bordier, el policía gibraltarian subio en el autobús y nos pidió la documentación. Cuando llegamos Gibraltar fuimos a la calle principal. Y entonces estábamos al cementerio. Muy sorprendía para nosotros porque era diferente de aquí.  Entonces montamos en un microbús y fuimos a la roca de Gibraltar. Allí, vimos los monos famosos. Los amamos, porque parecían animales muy amistosos. Entonces, entramos las cuevas y vimos el teatro adentro allí. Cuando dejamos las cuevas, podríamos comprar recuerdos.  Entonces, volvemos a la calle principal y teníamos mucho tiempo libre, así que fuimos al supermercado a comprar chocolate. En Gibraltar hay muchos tipos diferentes de chocolate. ?Compramos muchos de ellos! Cuando nos acabamos volvemos al microbús y fuimos a Málaga.  ?Era un viaje muy agradable!<br>  <br>  Lo unico que no se es bordier<br>  Y viaje es trip no tip espero poder ayudarte|`|f5126195351d06468da6c894d881e7ebaa	no
