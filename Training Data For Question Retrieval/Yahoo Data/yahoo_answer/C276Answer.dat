Kind, intelligent, loving and hot; <br>  This describes everything you are not. <br>  <br>  4. Love may be beautiful, love may be bliss, <br>  But I only slept with you 'cause I was pisxxxx. <br>  <br>  5. I thought that I could love no other <br>  -- that is until I met your brother. <br>  <br>  6. Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you. <br>  But the roses are wilting, the violets are dead, the sugar bowl's <br>  empty and so is your head. <br>  <br>  7. I want to feel your sweet embrace; <br>  But don't take that paper bag off your face. <br>  <br>  8. I love your smile, your face, and your eyes <br>  Darn, I'm good at telling lies! <br>  <br>  9. I see your face when I am dreaming. <br>  That's why I always wake up screaming. <br>  <br>  10. My feelings for you no words can tell, <br>  Except for maybe 'Go to hxxxx.' <br>  <br>  11.

52pZj3WFaa	Nope. And she expects to be treated differently too. Talk about believe your own press.<br>  <br>  The yobbo attacked a teenager with a golf club. Why should he be treated any differently to anyone else?<br>  <br>  And for all you 'supporters' about to give me a thumbs down - explain WHY she should be treated any differently to any one else.

I believe it is unfair and that there are more deserved people out there that should rreceivethe special treatment. I am not a sick person saying this and i do sympathise with Jade, I just believe it is not fair on the rest of the population.|`|ae711dfd39bbda60164ce1da18931e6daa	good question  but i think in real terms the true answer should in no way involve Jade or Jack and there media circus.  The true answer should re-vole around this pathetic spineless labour government getting in the lime light again and spinning a story  to there own ends to make them look popular and supportive. If the truth was really known you will probably find the the stage was set for jacks so called reprieve long before this news story came out. Whilst i have a lot of sympathy for Jade ,Jack on the other hand is after all a convicted criminal . i just wish that the media could do something useful for a change and highlight other issues in this country . But then again will it sell papers ???  I wonder if Mr Max Clifford would be so happy at Jacks reprieve if it was is nephew or friends son that he beat with a golf club|`|gGZz2EGyaa	You are correct the non celebrity husband would have gone back to his mother's home by 1900 hrs that night.  I read that her future husband could not spend all night with her but I had not seen your clip with the update, thanks for that one.  It really is a disgrace that he was allowed to break the conditions of his parole because he is marrying Jade Goody.<br>  I understand your question and I am not a Jade fan and I do feel sorry for her but hey if it was you and me in the same position the new husband would have been back at home by 1900 hrs. This is unfair to other couples who are in the same position.|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	no of course it wouldnt. average joe would have been told like it or lump it. its only because they are in the media and getting loads of money for this wedding that hes allowed out. what would max clifford have done if jack wasnt allowed out in time?! he wouldnt have got his money.<br>  i think jade is an idiot to marry jack if im honest. what is the point?! hes only after the money and i dont care how many people slate me for saying it but i couldnt care less about her or her family. if she wasnt in the limelight we wouldnt hear about her illness just like all the other thousands of people in this world going through the same thing.

84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	Being a teenager in the late 60s, early 70s it was not so different from today.  I don't recall any of the drugs, sex and rock and roll that was supposed to be going on.  Never saw a drug at all, never have, only one or two friends indulged in sex under the age of 16 because it was (and still is) against the law.  We enjoyed the music as it was a new era in music.   We went to coffee bars/clubs, stayed out until 2am, drank orange juice and had a dance.  Most of us kept out wits about us and enjoyed ourselves.  We wouldn't have been seen dead slobbering drunk and falling down in the streets, being sick and shouting and brawling.   Swearing was only for the vocabulary challenged.  Wasn't that interested in alcohol - most of us didn't have the money to waste.  We still did respect our elders, teachers, policemen etc.  Sometimes when I look around at the gangs of teenagers hanging around I wonder where they have all come from now.  Statistically, I would think there is a larger population of teenagers now than there was then but I can't help you with exact figures.|`|LGkb4xibaa	i was born in 1980. But ill have a go!<br>  <br>  the 1960's was the baby boomer years. So many people had waited for stability after the second world war in order to start a family, so by the late 1940's and throughout the 1950's, people started having their children. So by the 1960's their were more young people and children around.<br>  <br>  From what i know, the general atmosphere of the 1960's was carefree. Mods and rockers were a big thing. So people wore leathers and rode on bikes. Towards the mid 60's, hippy culture became popular- free love, peace and drugs (particularly lsd) came with being a hippy.<br>  <br>  Music included the beatles, the rolling stones, manfred man, the hollies, hermins hermits, freddie and the dreamers, the kinks and the who. On an alternative scale, it was also towards the end of this decade that led zeplin, black sabbath and pink floyd started up. <br>  <br>  In the news their was several oil crisis, the cold war with russia was in full swing, the cuban missile crisis occurred, america had a space race and landed on the moon (or not depending on your beliefs!). In britain, the economy was rather unstable and mini cars and morris minors were popular. Carnaby street was where you bought your clothes if you were anyone! <br>  <br>  Fashion in britain was beatles haircuts or hippy long hair with middle parting. Psychodelic clothing with swirling bright patterns were common. As were baggy clothes and sloppy joe jumpers if you were hippy. In women, beehive haircuts and hippy cuts were common. Mini skirts and thick eyeliner were often worn. Some people prefered to pencil their eyebrows on completely.<br>  <br>  In general, it was a time of freedom, happiness and high spirit.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i think  its an age full of legends and mysteries.<br>  <br>  sex liberation, and the vietnam war. anti-war activists.<br>  <br>  economic boom and breakdown, oil crisis everywhere.<br>  <br>  ofcoz you have to know the cuban missile crisis.<br>  <br>  i was born in the 80s, but im sure it's hell of a fun to live in the 60s.|`|peKTF4uIaa	It was about 40 - 50 years ago<br>  Everything was black and white|`|XVMxuADtaa	Yep - baby boomers<br>  <br>  Our society replenished itself after the war.<br>  <br>  Fewer children being born now.|`|GqTSa85daa	Maybe look at some Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc videos from that time frame.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	there were A LOT of teenagers and young people, it was the baby boom generation because so many people in the 50's had babies and families.

97sKOWQ0aa	The Wah-wah mute (also known by the brand name Harmon), is a hollow, bulbous mute in two parts. Unlike the more common straight or cup mutes, the Harmon mute has a solid ring of cork that completely blocks all of the air leaving the bell, and forces all of the instrument's air column into the mute. In a hole on the front of the mute there is a cup on a tube that can be slid in or out, or removed completely, depending on the composer's direction or the player's preference. The mute produces a sound perhaps best described as a highish-pitched 'buzz'. Harmon mutes are available for many brass instruments, but are only commonly used by trumpets and trombones. Miles Davis often played through a Harmon mute without the stem; this greatly shaped the character of his sound, and greatly influenced the jazz community in such classic tracks as "All Blues". A famous example of Harmon mute coupled with hand muting on trombone are the adults' voices in the animated Peanuts cartoons.<br>  <br>  Bucket mutes attach to the rim of the bell with springs and contain cotton or a similar substance. The effect is removal of high frequencies and a soft, muffled tone. Some modern bucket mutes (by JoRal for example) are designed as over sized straight mutes filled with batting, with large holes in along the side. These are held in the bell of the instrument with strips of cork, like straight and cup mutes, to make their use more convenient; players often find the spring-style mutes awkward for quick passages.<br>  <br>  Derby Mutes or hat mutes (also known as Bowler Hats, and also confusingly called Wah-wah mutes) were common in jazz from the 1920s when King Oliver played and others wrote for them. These mutes were originally actual bowler hats. In the 1920s with the advent of aluminum as an art metal, derby mutes were stamped out of metal by companies such as Meta-Lite, Elton, and Harmon. These replaced the use of the actual bowler derbies. From the 1950s to the present derby mutes were made of fibre (a resin impregnated cardboard). They are still available form the Humes & Berg Company. Derby mutes are typically mounted on stands in front of the trumpet and trombone players, to permit quick movement of the bell in and out of the hat quickly, although they can be opened and closed over the bell of the instrument by hand. These mutes have fallen somewhat out of favor in recent years, as bucket mutes or playing in to the music stand can give a somewhat similar sound.<br>  <br>  You move it up and down.|`|e97037e29bf6dd323c13e9097d4a5669aa	You stick it in your bell like you would a straight or cup mute. But remember to breath into your bell and just give it like, a quarter turn like you do when you put your mouthpiece in. Then it wont fall out. If you want the wa-wa sound, you need to use it with the plunger.<br>  You don't move the stem. That either stays in or you take it out. It just depends on what the song your playing calls for.

I have gathered them on my Squidoo page. You might like them.. <br>  <br>  If you do, please let me know what you think. I really think these are the best theories there are to be found.|`|mAiRFAfsaa	Hi, there is a whole section about the connections between lost and dark tower on some lost fan website. There are a load of connections that are really interesting. The other link is for the connections between Stephen King and lost in case you have read any of his other material or you just have an interest. Beware there may be spoilers for Lost, Dark Tower and Stephen King work.
o0CrpEyfaa	She made gin in her bathtub because of the prohibiton.  She didnt go to jail because she did try to stop her brother from killing Annie, even though she was in on the kidnapping.  She still didnt want her dead.  That was a big plus for her.  So i guess Daddy Warbucks forgave her for that.  He did have alot of political pull.|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	She's making "bathtub gin". This is during Prohibition, so people illegally prepared all sorts of alcoholic beverages in some strange ways. Bathtubs often were used for mixing ingredients, thus it generally was referred to as bathtub gin. <br>  <br>  I'm fairly certain that all three were arrested: Rooster, his wife (if she was), and Miss Hannigan. I think in one of the songs, she even tries to sweettalk Daddy Warbucks out of turning her in. I'm certain all three are on their way to jail at the end.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the arrangements were for the other orphans. That part doesn't "click" with me. I'm not sure about some of it because it's been a long, long time since I've seen the movie. I'll see what I can find out about it though. Perhaps others have fresher memories.

I believe that Lord of the Rings was shot prior to blu-ray so therefore it won't be coming out.<br>  <br>  They might release it on blu-ray but it would be standard quality.|`|2Sxhtuv0aa	does gollum like to eat raw fish?

upTcPaAyaa	It's most likely happening, read this news.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kudrow's Thumbs-Up To Friends Movie<br>  10 February 2009 11:01 AM, PST | From wenn.com | See recent WENN news<br>  <br>  Lisa Kudrow would love to star in a big-screen version of hit TV show Friends - but only if producers stay true to the original.The actress, who played Phoebe in the 1990s show about a group of apartment-sharing New Yorkers, could not bear to let down her co-stars if a movie reunion becomes reality. <br>  <br>  But she is adamant she would only agree if writers come up with a good script and producers make the effort to replicate the "feel" of the TV series. <br>  <br>  She says, "I think we are all of the opinion that it would depend on the script, but I've always felt that if everyone else was going to do a movie, then I wouldn't want to be the person who refused and then had to be replaced - that wouldn't be fair. So I would do it, but I've no idea how the show would translate to a movie. <br>  <br>  "It's not like Sex and the City. Friends was a multi-camera show filmed in front of an audience, so it has a very different feel. It would be tricky to pull off, sure, but if it could be done, that would be great."|`|Wq4AaymBaa	yeah, i heard about that, and at the moment, it doesn't look like anything is happening.<br>  i would love it to, because i'm a huge fan of the show but at the same time it would have to be amazing. a good storyline, the same characters we love, but in order to do that they need all the actors on board, and the support of a studio willing to take on the project.<br>  I think it was a rumour that their problem was Jennifer asking for too much money and all that, because I heard that Jennifer Aniston would be willing to do it, and she was their biggest obstacle as she is the most successful 'friend' so if they can get her to do it, the rest shouldn't be a problem.<br>  they were considering a friends reunion, but if they are doing something about it at the moment, it must be very low profile because i think we would hear about it if they were even thinking of doing a friends movie. at the moment it seems like a possible idea, nothing more though, unfortunately.|`|89d25df90098a3a917f7a0232401b354aa	I dont think so.

GdlwyXtTaa	I do take my phone to school. And there is no problem in that. I agree that you need it if an emergency appears. You don't have to turn the phones off. I just put it on silent. Because, once I talked with a teacher about keeping phones on silent in case of emergency, but he gave a grin and said "That is what we have the office phone for, right?" In school people want to control us. But mostly I think they don't let us take the phone to school because it might disturb the lessons (Yes, I know, a bit weird), or because we might use it for doing stuff like texting during classes, or even showing inappropriate pictures to people. And one thing I found out is like 'Take your phone to school at your own risk because the school doesn't take any responsibility to lost mobiles'. So more or less the school don't want to get in trouble.|`|wZmp9mAWaa	i take it but dont use it in class...you're not supposed to anyway :S and that is harsh, she should of just got a detetion..even though it's probably just a rumour|`|ldHvfvtnaa	some schools there are a policy about bringing phones to school but students still do it..<br>  <br>  i bring is to school because i play sports.|`|v5L3oKHIaa	YES... yes i do...|`|l0jpVdGKaa	i do but thats cos i dont care if mine gets jacked|`|q5sC6lTCaa	ye but i dun use it durin class|`|zsdvMXFyaa	Never.

KF85XfuGaa	Yeah. You explained it so well. It's always like that. It's more than entertainment to them. Like there are gang matters and classified stuff we don't see on screen. This explains why Jack Nicholson has to be sitting in the first row most of the time. Or why movies like "There will be blood" in spite of their little entertainment, get the oscar and movies like Hairspray (For example) don't even get involved with the whole ceremony. It's really complicated. The critics are just as disappointing as them. Like they're looking for the most boring movies to rank first and don't even care if it fails at the box office. They have kind of reversed the whole Art image of all the movies that come out to make money out of it. <br>  As I mentioned before it's complicated.|`|FbwyvwEYaa	I'm right there with you. I hate it when they give out oscars to movies  that either look entirely stupid and not worth any ones time or just really corny movies that SUCK. It's annoying when you know there are either movies that weren't on there that should have been or movies that shouldn't have been nominated cause they were either corny or boring. Gosh!|`|fe2f81588ecd4cf84508234a973e6b23aa	They try to avoid thinking that way, because<br>  some movies don't get the attention they need<br>  because of poor budgeting or advertising.<br>  <br>  However, they can be amazing, and have <br>  lasting value. ex (Memento, Shawshank Redemption,<br>  etc)|`|h1IYS0dbaa	You're wrong. Movies are not only supposed to be for entertainment. "Shindler's List" is a great movie but I wouldn't dare to call it entertainment. If you think that only entertaining movies have a value you don't have a clue about good cinema.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  I agree with you that a movie shouldn't be boring. However, what the majority finds boring is not relevant. The majority of people loves Britney Spears. That doesn't mean that her music is worth listening. Actually, her music sucks. The same for movies. Half America is crazy about the movie "Twilight" at the moment. What do I care? I watch different genres and want a movie to be a good one. That can even be an action movie. Schindler's List was just an example. Besides that, I didn't watch that movie in order to be informed. I know quite enough about that particular period of history. It's just a good movie. There are many other good movies without entertaining aspects. You should just watch them.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	I agree with you 110%. Some movies like Crash or The Gladiator, in my opinion, didn't deserve the Oscar. It was stupid. I think these critics are too deeply minded, for what each film means. Each film has a very deep meaning, most of us can't find it. Apparently these critics do. For example, Crash taught us racism, karma, etc. That's can't be the only lesson. There has to be something deeper. & critics usually finds that deeper. Usually films that scored low at the box office, it's b/c the trailer wasn't interesting. Like The Reader. It didn't make much money, BUT the story was definetly Oscar worthy. & critics find that. They can just put up The Dark Knight at least for ONE nomination which made $587 million, but The Reader has 5 Oscar nominations. weird huh? it's how it works.<br>  <br>  But not all the time their choices are stupid. I agree with them pretty much 79% of the time. They made good choices like Forrest Gump (1994), The Godfather(1972), Titanic(1997), Lord of the Rings(2003), Chicago(2001), & No Country for Old Men(2007).
sLJDrsfLaa	An Atheist? x<br>  LOL x<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Here's some Quotes From:<br>  <br>  THE SIMPSONS x<br>  <br>      "I've always wondered if there was a god. And now I know there is -- and it's me."<br>      - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      "Dear Lord: The gods have been good to me. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is. So here's the deal: You freeze everything the way it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is OK, please give me absolutely no sign. OK, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done." - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>  <br>      "Good drink... good meat... good God, let's eat!" - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      Stealing? How could you?! Haven’t you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what’s-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn’t hear anybody laughin’, did you?”<br>      - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      "I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me Superman!"<br>      - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      "Come on Milhouse, there’s no such thing as a soul! It’s just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson.”<br>      - Bart Simpson<br>  <br>      "I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens, he came in peace and then died, only to come back to life, and his name was E.T., the extra terestrial. I loved that little guy."<br>      - Reverend Lovejoy<br>  <br>      "Once something has been approved by the Government, It's no longer immoral."<br>      - Reverend Lovejoy<br>  <br>      "And as we pass the collection plate, please give as if the person next to you was watching."<br>      -Reverend Lovejoy<br>  <br>      Lovejoy: "Get a divorce."<br>      Marge: "But isn't that a sin?"<br>      Lovejoy: "Marge, just about everything is a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go to the bathroom."<br>  <br>      "This so-called new religion is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants designed to take away the money of fools. Now let us say the lord's prayer 40 times, but first let's pass the collection plate."<br>      - Rev. Lovejoy<br>  <br>      "Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends! Well I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"<br>      - Ned Flanders<br>  <br>      "I put out these milk and cookies as a sacrifice. If Thou wishest me to eat them, please give me a<br>      sign by doing absolutely nothing. MMMMmmmm..."<br>      - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      "If the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to GIRLS sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."<br>      - Homer Simpson<br>  <br>      "Prayer has no place in the public schools, just like facts have no place in organized religion."<br>      - School Superintendent on "The Simpsons" episode #100, 1994<br>  <br>      "Suppose we've chosen the wrong god. Every time we go to church we're just making him madder and madder"<br>      - Homer Simpson's version of Pascal's Wager<br>  <br>  Hope that made you laugh ;D x<br>  XOXOXxx|`|56zYVjdTaa	That is NOT a joke.|`|VPldzHUDaa	It's from an episode of "The Simpsons"! That is a quote, or, rather a "prayer" from Homer! I love that show!

Maybe Capricorn...but I'll go with Taurus anyway.|`|AA10706358	Well you're either Virgo or Leo<br>  Virgo's (like myself) are neat peaceful<br>  Leo's are outgoing and they usually girls have their hair like you do<br>  which is lovely by the way<br>  That is what I guess from your avatar !!|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Libra with Leo rising|`|J45b1wEkaa	Libra?|`|SjD1aKT5aa	Leo or Virgo, but ain't to sure on rising sign.<br>  <br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|siuC4LNWaa	cancer, sciorpio or pieces|`|WpQmpbPwaa	Pisces sun sign & Leo rising <br>  <br>  Or vice versa|`|uzBWEZnoaa	aries, you look simular to my close friend who is aries... :) xx...<br>  oh someone already said it :( But i didnt cheat lol|`|stvF3nvoaa	Aries sun, capricorn rising!|`|mvf6hSSLaa	Cancer|`|plBXp91Daa	Leo or Gemini one of this two star sign.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Aries sun<br>  <br>  Pisces rising|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	I think that you are an aries.

I think you may be pisces or gemini because I don't really see so too much fire in your aura or whatever when I look at your pic. You are a fire sign. But you also seem like your very nice and stuff. So that's my little opinion on that.|`|9KklyOcbaa	You're an Aries. You seem friendly and pretty.

Lt3Ea60vaa	I think that given we wouldn't have a choice to be ready or not, I would do okay. No one is perfect, but I would be somewhat reminiscent of having led a life of servitude. I am a teacher and always put everyone else above me--I've been called submissive, too tolerant, too nice, too considerate, a stepping stone, a nurturer...I don't think those are bad things taking the nature of this question into consideration...|`|mu94enaVaa	this is why i stay farrrrrr away from religion :)|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	I would love to hear, "Well done, my good and faithful servant" but I would not should He return today.|`|92d57b37b7c75c656647e34f55fa3e0caa	no i am not ready|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I don't believe in a master so, no I'm not worried.

In my job I have to work with a lot of sick people that some family don't even come see. I even bring them things to brighten up there day. It hurts when I lose one of my patient especially when you are close to them, but I know they are better off where they are at, because they are not in no more pain.|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Professionally speaking, yes.

I was thinking maybe they sold their souls to the devil so they would be popular no matter what, but... surely the devil wouldn't want their souls?! :s<br>  <br>  PMSL at whoever thinks anyone would be jealous of them! Seriously, why would anyone be jealous? Lol! <br>  <br>  They don't bother me that much though, because I listen to good music, it's just their fans that try to say they are the best thing ever who do!

f15fae9678a173ccb0d1f8132c549bedaa	I know Im going to get the thumbs down for this and I do feel incredibly sorry for Jade, because it is awful. But I dont think he should get the night off from his tag either. I know shes going to die and I understand she wants to be able to do all these nice things but she could just have got married near to Essex so he could go back to his mothers and she could have gone with him and spent the wedding night there. You cant break rules for some and not others. How many more people are out there in a similar situation to she is?? r they getting the help she is? how must they feel?|`|u2EUom6daa	if you don't have the wedding night the marriage is not proper is it....if i have understood things right if you don't do the deed you can simply get your marriage annulled but once you have done it it has to be a divorce.....<br>  <br>  i have heard of people being released from prison to go to funerals and hospitals to be with family and all they are doing is letting Jack spend 1 night with Jade (his bail conditions are to spend every night at his mothers house) not that she will be in any state to do anything as she does not even have the energy to walk.. i think it shows the government have a heart the poor girl is going to be dead in a couple of weeks and she's only 27 with 2 small boys do you seriously think it so bad that they are letting Jack spend 1 night with her it will be the last time they will ever spend the night together.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	you really are one sad sick idiot.<br>  For someone who hates Jade so much you spend a lot of time answering Qs about her.<br>  Lowlife.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	its not him its the judge or whoever saw it fit to let him off ..... i might just not pay my TV license or my council tax get locked up for a few months and ask for them to let me off and see how quick they are to say TAKE HER DOWN|`|bNllesmMaa	The irony to this question is hillarious..|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	The woman's dying, and by the sounds of it doesn't have more than 2 months left to live. Let her have at least one dying wish and spend her wedding night with her husband. I'm actually glad he showed compassion. If your partner was dying and you were on tag, i doubt you'd be complaining if you were lucky enough to be let off for one night..|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	He did that so that the government can provide some "good news" and get the public to taketheir minds off the recession.|`|52pZj3WFaa	This so-called story just gets better and better, It's like another layer of mould on a stale peice of cheese.|`|260f178c6fc34e7d0c73b917e2a51e55aa	why don't you show a little bit of compassion and see why he has spent time on this case, he has a heart, obviously you don't!!!

And he's showing all the tourists around the village. He points to a row of houses and says, "See all these houses? I built all of them. Do they call me Angus the House Builder? No, they don't!" They walk on and see some fences around the fields. "Yes, I built all these fences. But do they call me Angus the Fence Builder? No, they don't!" Then they walk on further and he says, "In fact I built most of the roads in the middle of the village. But do they call me Angus the Road Builder? No, they don't."

He follows the same routine every morning: he gets up, orders an English breakfast, goes for a walk, and comes back. But one morning all he orders in his fried breakfast is just baked beans. He eats the whole plate of beans, goes for a walk, but doesn't come back. Later the day the police turn up. They inform the motel manager, who knew the man, that morning the man killed himself. "Strange," said the manager. "He seemed happy. In fact when he left here this morning, he was full of beans!"|`|vMR0IqNCaa	Patient: Doctor doctor i stay up all night dancing to 80s music and   can't sleep what wrong with me<br>  Doctor: it sounds like you have boogie fever<br>  Both: ha ha ha<br>  Doctor: it's fatal<br>  <br>  a horse walks into a bar and the barman says "why the long face" the horse says " i have cancer"|`|YY4QBP4baa	What's more entertaining that spinning a baby on the clothes line at 150 miles per hour?<br>  <br>  Stopping it with a shovel.|`|hom46Iogaa	Don't know|`|pYWUuXsaaa	Of course, dead baby jokes are about as dark as you can get, so---<br>  <br>  What's worse than a truckful of dead babies?<br>  One live one at the bottom, eating his way out.<br>  <br>  Or how about this---<br>  <br>  A guy goes to a whorehouse and finds out they're running a special, one hour with one of the women for just $10.  He can't pass up a bargain like that, so he pays and is directed to a room, where there's a naked woman quietly laying on the bed.  He takes his clothes off and has at her.  She says nothing, and never even moves.  Well, he thinks, what should I expect for ten bucks?  At the climactic moment, semen starts leaking from her from her vagina, anus, mouth, nose, and ears.  The guy freaks out and goes running into the hall.  He stammers his story to the bouncer, who goes up front and says, "Hey, Sam, the dead one's full again!"

It's bandied about that they are "well understood", but they're not, even the official NIST report to the commission mentions the towers "poised to fall", but doesn't expalin how they actually fell.<br>  <br>  WTC7 was largely ignored, and there is no scientific explanation, for all the beams, all the rivets, all girders, all the braces, and connections failing simultaneously, on each face.<br>  <br>  If one has a grasp of high school physics, or above, to watch this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p...</a><br>  <br>  and believe it is anything but a controlled demolition, would suggest mindless denial.<br>  <br>  There's so much more, (as you know from zero), and more besides.<br>  <br>  It would be willfully stupid to believe the offficial story, there's hard science and logic involved, it is not a matter of opinion, that the official story is a lie, and that it was indeed an inside job, of sorts.<br>  (I don't think it was the actual government, but elements within it, along with others).|`|Nr4dOPWWaa	Yes definately it was an inside jon. To make citizens of USA scared and plan to attack countries with huge oil resources. There are many documentaries on this topic, not forgetting Farenheit 9/11 showing how competetive and reliable Bush was.|`|0nn8XKy4aa	I think this is not a joking matter|`|QPB6e3lVaa	I think that it is a shame that people "play" with such a serious business, not you and this forum, but anyone who creates movies with such a political bent that it is terrible. How stupid can you be to believe such crap?<br>  <br>  I was the engineer who was hired to figure out how long it would take to rebuild the towers (not that anyone was going to). The insurance companies had to pay for lost income for the duration between 9/11 and the date the towers "could" be rebuilt. I was supplied the plans for the buildings and all the help I needed to figure it out. The plans show many things that the movies do not.<br>  <br>  One way to help explain why the buildings came down is this, if you held a wooden yardstick vertically and pushed down on the top, what would happen? The yardstick would bend. If you pushed hard enough it would bend and then break. Now, if you held the yardstick in the middle, and then pushed on the top end, it would be harder to bend and break the yardstick. If you put a support every inch, it would take a huge force to break it. That is how the World Trade Center buildings 1 and 2 were built, with supporting floors all the way up. When the explosion of the airplane fuel ignited all the desks, paper, carpet, etc. and they started burning, the interior floors started to collapsed. As each floor collapsed the exterior walls had less and less support, getting to the point where, like the yardstick, the walls finally bent and broke. As the planes hit well down from the top, all the weight of the floors above was pushing down until the collapse. <br>  <br>  No steel melted, the fires did not get that hot, but as you know, when steel gets hot it can more easily be bent. For example, when someone is shoeing a horse they put the horse shoe into the fire to get it hot, then they can bend it to the shape of the horses hoof. The fire does not melt the shoe, but steel goes from rigid to mallable with heat. The insulation that was around the steel members to protect it from such heat was blown away by the explosion, then the fire in the towers got the steel hot enough so it could no longer support the weight. When it got malleble and bent, the load was too great and everything came down.<br>  <br>  As the weight was so great, once it started to collapse, it could not be stopped. Each floor adding to the weight travelling down and impacting the floor below with more and more force. Just like a balloon, each floor below was popped with a huge force sounding like an explosion. No explosives were needed to bring them down, the weight did that on it's own.<br>  <br>  Building 7 was built over the top of an electrical sub-station. It also had thousand of gallons of fuel in a tank inside which was used to run generators. When you build a normal steel building you place supports at all four corners, then interior ones to support the upper floors. As Building 7 was built over existing facilities (the electrical sub-station), the design had to take into account the machinery already in place. Thus the structure could not be built with supports at the corners and regularly spaced supports inside, so the designers built supports kind of like springboards in a pool to hold supports out over machinery. The fire that started inside the building had plenty of fuel, electrical sub-stations burn very hot, and when the steel started to get soft from the heat, it was easy to collapse the building. Again, no explosives were needed, just a little heat.<br>  <br>  If you note, many references were made in the movie to "the government" and the "government hiding something". Why mention the "government"? Because these movies are trying to play on peoples fears: they have their own agenda. They do not want to hear the truth, but want to scare people into joining them. It is funny that some say that it was "aliens" that did it, others the government. Explosives were used, explosives were not used. There were people in the planes, there were not people in the planes (the people are "being held on islands in the Carribean"). There were missles involved, not planes, no planes were involved. If you look at the evidence objectively, airplanes were hijacked, they were flown into buildings, the buildings were compromised and fell. End of story, don't believe the rest, they only are trying to stir up trouble for their own edification.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ItQOLOSXaa	Of course it was. The insurance, the explosions occurring AFTER impact, the total absence of any air defence despite the fact it's one of the world's most sophisticated systems, Bush's indifference when told, the senators who were advised not to fly out on that day... <br>  The engineer is speaking a load of misinfo balls. The WTC towers were structurally compromised, and had they not been demolished, they probably would have fallen themselves within a couple of years. The question is not that they came down easily enough, the question is the perpertrators were the US government, who covered it up to make it look like it was carried out by Muslim extremists. Osama's brother Salim worked for George Bush's own oil company before Bush became President. I guess the family was significantly ethnic looking to pose as Muslim extremists.<br>  There is no war on terror. Get it? We're not in danger. There's big bucks in keeping us stressed out, then we consume more, turn to smoking and drinking, etc. We should be naturally at peace with the world. Which we can be once we lose all this crap designed to fool and us and contain us.|`|4b798fd15a00e28e3307364e0cd1960aaa	definately an inside job, if they hadn't of got those planes inide the buildings then they might not have fallen down.|`|hom46Iogaa	You freak,,,<br>  Do you think this question fits in the category Jokes and Riddles???

1A4klmh7aa	Ok.<br>  <br>  Harry was a half-blood. His father, James, was a from a pure-blood family. His mother, Lily, was born from muggle parents, but she herself was not a muggle.<br>  <br>  The difference between muggle and muggleborn is rather simple. <br>  <br>  A Muggle is a non-magic person. Normal everyday people like me and you are muggles.<br>  <br>  A Muggle-born is a wizard that comes from muggle parents. In other words, their parents have no magic, but for some reason the child ended up being magical. <br>  <br>  This can happen in reverse as well. A non-magical child can be the product of two magical parents, and that child is then called a "squib"<br>  <br>  To be a pure-blood wizard, one must be descended of completely magical lines with no mixing of half-blood or "Mudblood" (muggle-born blood or muggle blood).<br>  <br>  A half-blood is basically any wizard with a combination of muggle blood and pureblood. Most wizards fall into this category.<br>  <br>  <br>  The blood status of a child having a muggle-born parent and a muggle parent would probably be considered half-blood, because one of the parents was magical. But it would depend who you ask, I suppose. Some wizards in the series seemed to be more particular about blood status than others, so perhaps to an extremist that child would still be considered a mudblood. <br>  <br>  Does that help?|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I don't think there's a difference between Muggle and Muggle born.|`|i8vpe2g7aa	The blood status of a child with a Muggle and Muggle-born as parents? That's actually a good question. Harry is the son of a Muggle-born and pure-blood, which made me think that he would also be a pure-blood due to having two magical parents, but he is a half-blood. It took me a while to realise that this is because, although Muggle-borns have magical powers, they only have Muggle blood in them. Possessing magic powers and blood status are different things. Also for someone to be pure-blood, all of their grandparents must be magical. So a child born to a Muggle and Muggle-born would also be a Muggle-born, due to having only Muggle blood in them. It's very confusing but I'm sure that it's right. The child would have to have one pure-blood parent to be a half-blood like Harry.|`|kIwABSTtaa	A Muggle is someone that has no magic in them. Example: The Dursely's they dion't do magic they just know about it because of Harry being a wizard and Petunia's sister Lily being a witch<br>  <br>   A Muggleborn is someone who has magical abilities even though they have no magical families- Hermione Granger- her parents have no magical talents yet she has magical abilities. Also known as Mudbloods to people like Draco and Bellatrix who are purebloods<br>  <br>  Basically a Muggleborn is someone that has magic but no magical parents so they are witches and wizards.  A Muggle is someone with not a drop of magical blood in there veins who either doesn't know about magic or someone in there family is magic and that is how they know about it.|`|3ArzaXP3aa	Harry is a half blood (a child of mixed parentage or with recent muggle ancestry from either side of the family).<br>  <br>  Hermione is muggle born (where both parents are muggles).
zg82CYzIaa	its an electric fork|`|PxJXJKCpaa	A "lip-vibrated aerophone," the baroque trumpet is a musical instrument in the brass family (Smithers 1988). A baroque trumpet is a brass instrument used in the 16th through 18th centuries, or a modern replica of a period instrument. Modern reproductions include both natural trumpets and the slightly embellished vented trumpets (Barclay 1998).<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 History <br>  1.1 Instruments of the period <br>  2 Modern reproductions <br>  3 Construction <br>  4 See also <br>  5 References <br>  6 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] History<br>  The first trumpets were made by vibrating the lips into an amplifier of some type, like a shell or an animal horn. The first metal trumpets are attributed to the Egyptians, after two trumpets were discovered in the tomb of Tutankhamun: one of silver and one of bronze. These types of trumpets were used for signaling, and the sound they produce has been compared to the braying of a donkey. The trumpet’s primary use through most of history has been for signaling, especially in times of war. In the Middle Ages, the trumpet began to appear in courts, providing ceremonial fanfares (Tarr 1988).<br>  <br>  Around 1400, instrument makers discovered the method for tube bending, and the trumpet began to take its familiar curved shape. Around the same time, trumpet players began to experiment with the range of the trumpet. By the 1550s, five part trumpet ensembles requiring each player to perform a different register of the trumpet were appearing (Tarr 1988).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Instruments of the period<br>  Some of the finest surviving examples of trumpets from the Baroque period date back as far as the 1580s, and were made by Anton Schnitzer of Nuremberg (Barclay 1992). Other notable trumpet makers include: the Hainlein family of Nuremberg, the Haas family of Nuremberg, the Ehe family of Nuremberg, and William Bull of London (Bate 1978). All of these instrument makers built what are now called natural trumpets. During the period, however, these instruments were simply called trumpets.<br>  <br>  Natural trumpets are crafted from brass, copper, bronze, or silver. Natural trumpets are difficult to play because they have no method of chromatic alteration, such as the valves of a modern trumpet. Instead, natural trumpets rely on the harmonic series, and pitch bending by the player to correct the out-of-tune harmonics. The harmonic series is a series of notes that can be created by causing the vibrating body (a column of air in the case of a trumpet) to cease vibrating at its fundamental frequency and instead resonate at any number of harmonics or partials (Smithers 1978). The natural harmonic series has several notes that are out-of-tune to modern ears, notably the 7th, 11th and 13th partials. Where a composition demands these notes, the player must 'lip' them into tune, a notoriously difficult task (Barclay). During the 17th and 18th centuries, this technique was called Heruntertreiben (literally, "driving down") by the Germans, and players were able to master it only after years of arduous training (Tarr 1988).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Modern reproductions<br>  Nowadays, the term "baroque trumpet" has come to mean a reproduction or copy of an original natural trumpet. These are the instruments most often employed by period instrument ensembles in an attempt to emulate historical performance practice. Originals are seldom used, for reasons outlined below. However, modern reproductions contain an element not found on the originals (Barclay 1998).<br>  <br>  Modern-day baroque trumpets are fitted with one or more so-called vent holes. Many instruments, such as the "Modell Tarr" made by Ewald Meinl Musikinstrumentenbau GmbH of Germany[1], have just one hole, usually covered by the right thumb. When opened, the vent hole creates a node, or a position along the vibrating air column where the pressure variations are at a minimum. This creates a transposition--in the case of the thumb vent hole, the entire harmonic series of the trumpet is shifted up by a fourth. Most of the time, the hole remains covered, allowing the instrument to sound in its original key, whether Bb, C, D, Eb or F. In order to play the out-of-tune 11th and 13th harmonics (notated f2, and a2), for example, the player opens the thumb vent hole and plays the f2 and a2 as the 8th and 10th harmonics of the new series. Some baroque trumpets have extra "cheater" holes that allow the player to make half-step transpositions and blow a relatively easy high C. (Steele-Perkins 2001). An example of a multi-hole baroque trumpet is the coiled J?gertrompete made by Helmut Finke[2], used by the Concentus musicus Wien on many of their early recordings. However, this model has fallen out of favor with period instrument groups, and is seldom used nowadays.<br>  <br>  The sound of a vented note is noticeably weaker and less resonant than that of unvented notes (thumb hole covered). In practice, this is of little consequence, since the out-of-tune f2 and a2 are usually sounded briefly in passing.

UPN3zqq6aa	your a: Gemini<br>  He is: Aries<br>  <br>  Gemini + Aries <br>  <br>  Air + Fire = Hot Air<br>  <br>  Gemini, you will definitely stimulate Aries. You interact quite explosively, with your Gemini element of air fanning the flames of the Aries fire. This combination of elements usually indicates an exciting relationship.<br>  <br>  On an intellectual and physical level, you and Aries enjoy first-rate friendship, conversation and inspiring times together. Aries will find your quick wit and fast lifestyle a good fit with their impatience and liveliness. Aries can’t handle waiting for anything, so you’ll both be zipping around at warp speed.<br>  <br>  Aries could blow your mind, though, because you live on your nerves, and you may not have the stamina and follow-through of Aries. They may even take pleasure in testing your limits — they like to see where a person’s breaking point or pain threshold is. If you can keep up they’ll respect you more. Be prepared for some late nights and wild times along the way!<br>  <br>  You will have a great romantic and sexual connection. You’ll both have a ball exploring the playful, childlike energy you share. You’ll want to give Aries experiences they haven’t had before, and you’ll keep coming up with new ways to turn them on. They will be amazed at how original you can be when it comes to the bedroom arts! <br>  <br>  You will sometimes feel that a river of ideas is flowing through you to Aries. This is their stimulating fire element doing its thing to you, warming your creative self. <br>  <br>  But Aries goes headlong into everything, including lovemaking! While you’ll enjoy their brash raw heat, you’ll also want some playful chit-chat. You may need to spend time talking the hot-blooded Aries down a notch or two before consummating that raw, primal instinct between you. <br>  <br>  And while there’s plenty of heat between the sheets, you may not be destined for long term or marital ties. <br>  <br>  Those born between 12 March and 30 March will become good friends with you. You will easily open up to them, as they will to you. This combination will thrive only if it is surrounded by friends and social alliances. Mind you, this dynamic duo will inspire the friends you share. <br>  <br>  Aries born between 31 March and 10 April will become good associates because you have great rapport with them. In business or commercial enterprises you make a great team. You seem to have an innate understanding of each other’s needs and will support each other, even during tough times. <br>  <br>  The best Aries for you are those born between 11 April and 19 April — their co-ruler, Jupiter, has power over your marital and long-term affairs sector. This is likely to be the best match for marriage and deep romantic ties between you and an Aries.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|XoOanmdraa	i dont believe in this crap|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Ok kl.<br>  <br>  Wow you have your Sun, Moon & Mercury in Taurus<br>  and he has his Sun, Mercury, Venus && Mars in Aries.<br>  You both have very dominant charts.<br>  Looking at your signs i can see why you both were attracted to each other..<br>  <br>  His moon is in Virgo which makes him feel connected and attracted to your Taurus Sun.

ADBMrG87aa	The networks are always interrupting soaps right when its about to get interesting with so called breaking news or something, at least today it was the president elect giving the nation an update on his plans and progress so far; its important to know what's happening in washington.

And I have a cousin who says all kinds of weird things when she's asleep.

irSBrZiQaa	I love As The World Turns too! I have been watching for about 12 years and it is my favorite soap.... I am so interested to see what happens with Katie/Brad/Spencer. I did not think I was going to be so interested in this storyline, but it took a twist yesterday. I am curious to see how Brad talks his way out of this one. I don't think that Brad killed Spencer. However I think that Dani is somehow related to Spencer. I am also curious to see how the Carly/Jack/Janet storyline plays out, this is my favorite storyline. I   am wondering what this new girl in Dusty's life is all about. I loved Jennifer and Dusty together. I hope it is not a set up from Paul. Paul needs to fix this thing with Meg before she leaves for good. <br>  <br>  I also watch Guiding Light, I have been watching that show for about 12 years as well. I wonder if Bill will make it, I hope so. Lizzie and Bill need to be together already. I also wonder if Grady and Dinah will be exposed. I am looking forward to seeing more of Reva finally. |`|q5BkV27Daa	The Bill and Corrie, but as I think you are  in the US that probably means nothing to you!|`|yNfZO1I8aa	Thank you!!!<br>  <br>  I could not agree more. I watch ATWT everyday, faithfully, on cbs.com. I grew up watching all the CBS soaps, 16 years worth of watching, and I am still fairly interested in all of them. ATWT has been by far my favorite soap, let alone my favorite show, and I find the actors to be amazing. Van Hansis (Luke) and Maura West (Carly), along with a ton of other people, are by far the most talented in the soap world. I also find their writing to be fantastic, usually, although some storylines are not planned very well. I wish Luke/Noah were on more, and less Dusty stuff now. Still, I remain a dedicated watcher.<br>  <br>  I also watch Y&R, B&B, and GL during the summer. However, I am the least fond of Y&R-not sure why :)|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I watch General Hospital.  I've been watching since I was a kid (my mom got me hooked) so I've been watching it for 20+ years now.<br>  <br>  Every now and again, I watch the following shows: Young and the Restless, All My Children, One Life to Live, and Days of Our Lives.  But I only watch those sporadically (like if I have a day off or if I hear of something that sounds interesting, I might watch it on You Tube.)  GH is the only one I watch regularly.|`|aLIVdFtoaa	1. Y&R (my favorite)<br>  <br>  2. B&B <br>  <br>  3. ATWT |`|LO3BMobRaa	Y&R, B&B, ATWT (it'll be better if Jack & Carly were together).|`|rabjcdjHaa	Yes, I watch Days of our Lives. |`|gsyoaC0Maa	I watched Passions for 7 years before it just went off the air this summer.  I've been watching Days of Our Lives for 6 years.  I watch As the World Turns off and on.<br>  <br>  YouTube is also great for watching European soaps.  I watch the British soap Hollyoaks and the German soap Verbotene Liebe (with subtitles, of course).  The great thing about European soaps is that the actors take it much more seriously and are much better actors.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	I watch General Hospital and I have watched it since 1988.

AA10478980	All his movies were memorable and many of them were great.  I liked all his movies, but I really enjoyed his supporting role in Message in a Bottle.  He brought humor and insight to the character of the father.  It's hard to beat him in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid though.  I admire him as much for his philanthropy and family values as for his movies.  He's gone but not forgotten.  He has left a great legacy.  He was a good person.|`|YkZm5VWhaa	The Long Hot Summer<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051878/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051878/</a>|`|7e7cb48ca14510a1f4daeb63d56a4974aa	Cool Hand Luke|`|DQkDQraOaa	I'm with you - Cool Hand Luke!!!! |`|z1f81s0Yaa	Cool Hand Luke (even named my son Luke after that movie)  what an awesome performance!!!

Yes because it would be great to live in the White House. The White House has a bowling alley, a movie theater, a swimming pool, a red room, a green room, a yellow room, and a blue room. Being president pays you a lot of money and the amount of money paid a year is very high. No because it would be hard to make choices and decisions for our country and give opinions and make plans on how to help issues like economy, health care, and education every day. The United States of America is relying and depending on you to make it a better country and one mistake can lead to huge problems in our country. You need to understand a lot about civics and what is going on in the world. The president deals with federal, state, and local government, executive, legislative, and judicial branches, economic principles, and much more. You can barely rest and you can't even breathe because it is a major job and responsibility to take on. You can't really have any freedom and enjoy your life while it lasts.|`|LgNqYUECaa	No, I would be a terrible president.|`|TxEJarDRaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...|`|kVTDDNp0aa	ya. president of my house!<br>  like thatll ever happen...|`|nGNJFyGXaa	not if you're gonna make fun of me

3c30415ed271c6f227383fd142b40126aa	Al principio sí parece ofensiva la pregunta, pero luego no.lo entiendo perfectamente porque es algo muy común......mira, yo acabo de pasar por dos situaciones muy dolorosas: la muerte de mi madre, y el divorcio de mi marido, que además de abandonarme en el peor momento de mi vida, me maltrató!!!!, bueno eso pasó, ahora he vuelto a enamorarme. ?Te puedes creer, que la gente, al morir mi madre, sin saber por qué tomé la dura y triste decisión de divorciarme y de salir del infierno, me aconsejaban que volviese con él????????, ?te imaginas semejante atrocidad??????La gente aconseja sin saber, unos de buena fe, pero ignorantes, otros de mala fe, por cobardes o envisdiosos, en Espa?a, la envidia es el deporte nacional, y que no se tome a mal, que adoro a mi país, y está llenode virtudes, pero , hay que ver, hay que ver.......yo, si alguien tiene problemas y toma esas decisiones, no pienso que es tonto, pensaré que le sobran motivos para tomarlas.......pero no, chico, hay gente que se cree en posesión de la verdad, son detestables, parecen los abogados del diablo......igual que ahora, ni se me ocurra decir que me enamoré aquí en yahoo R de Ropckodrilo, ya puede ser un santo, que muchos por prejuicios lo van a crucificar, PUROS AMARGADOS, ELLOS SI QUE SON INFELICES Y ABURRIDOS, quien tiene la vida llena, no se ocupa de juzgar la de los demás!!!!!!!!|`|30f1d118c1a34ab07150bc1f7ea82c58aa	EL QUE LE QUEDE EL SACO QUE SE LO PONGA<br>  NO HAY QUE JUZGAR SIN ANTES CONOCER LAS 2 PARTES|`|38ffdf36953e6f947dd5e6dc11b4c436aa	La ignorancia está en todos, solo que algunos sabemos conducirnos mejor que otros y no la evidenciamos, pero nunca se podrá dejar de aprender y ello significa que siempre seremos un tanto ignorantes. Si tú no lo fueras sabrías como interactuar con alguien que aparentemente no se pone las pilas y parece un ignorante, sin alterar tus emociones,  acuerdate que el león no es como lo pintan!! <br>  <br>  Me parece que te la acabas de aplicar solito.|`|7CBMAVXpaa	Ese tipo de gente vive en mi barrio y los odio... se quieren hacer los que saben y no saben ni hablar...<br>  saludos..|`|JBoDx9wzaa	Creo entender el por qué de tu pregunta. El usuario al que te referís no es ignorante. Ignorante es aquel que ignora, que no sabe, que no tuvo la posibilidad de aprender pero que no por ello, deba ser una mala persona o una persona detestable.<br>  El usuario en cuestión (muy detestable) es alguien con una discapacidad moral, un complejo de inferioridad y un resentimiento hacia su familia, su modo de vida y su entorno social que excede los límites de lo imaginable en cuanto a interpretaciones psicológicas.<br>  La mejor forma de no agredir a una mente enferma es persuadirla a que busque ayuda en un ámbito de contención (profesionales de la salud psíquica) y, para no lastimarla, creo que nos conviene no responderle.<br>  Un saludo.|`|328d659bb907caa8022f139c316353bbaa	Yo pienso que todos somos ignorantes de una manera u otra, lo que se me hace que a tí te molesta es la necedad que no es lo mismo que la ignorancia, la necedad es la incapacidad del ser humano de ver la realidad aunque se la comprueben, y eso es lo detestable del ser humano, no su ignorancia, porque con sacarlos de ella basta, el chiste es que ellos quieran salir de ella y crezcan al conocerla. Recibe un beso querido.|`|fQVk6dAyaa	Creo que esta mal formulada tu pregunta amigo, si puede ser que ese tipo de seres carezcan de amor propio, tengan baja su autoestima o inconscientementes se sientan fracasados!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Chauuuuuuchis!!!|`|0cbb0db02547dfed5ee73a49fd679dc7aa	no hay peor ignorante que el que se cree que se las sabe todas, no creo que hayas ofendido, si ofendiste a un ignorante seguro no van a aceptar tus disculpas|`|1gBsNJ9Qaa	porque somos ignorantes|`|61e2909073bd9338f2326d3ce2692144aa	No, no hay de que, a mi no me ofendiste, pero, no tenias por que rebajarte a su nivel de estupidez...<br>  Simplemente hay que ignorarles, y punto, nada de insultos ni ofensas mi amigo...<br>  Al cabo de unos minutos se sentirán solos y se irán a masturbar...<br>  Saludos...|`|7nLv9Fnzaa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo en el sentido de juzgar y criticar a las persona por sus actos sin conocer las causas que los llevaron a actuar de determinada manera...lamentablemente la vida está llena de personas así y creo que uno también ha caído en el error...como dicen "el que esté libre de pecado que tire la primera piedra"<br>  <br>  Te dejo sonrisas por montones para tu día!

Hay gente, hombres y mujeres, que hasta el agua se les quema. No, sin exagerar, hay gente que cuando cocina la comida le queda insípida o con mal sabor. Sucede, y en ese caso es mejor atenerse a recetas sencillas y a la comida que se pueda preparar. Por ejemplo el esposo puede ser el que cocina y si no hay esposo el que este a mano. No es algo así como un requisito para ser una mujer útil. Hay cosas muchisimo mas inportantes e irreemplazables como la inteligencia, el buen juicio, la nobleza, el instinto maternal. Esas si son cualidades muy estimables porque no se consiguen de repuesto en ningún lugar afuera de uno mismo y si no tienen en abundancia es una calamidad.

0r4wEIyaaa	Creo que un poco de als dos por que ahora ya cualquiera es Mc y sin tener experiencia alguna en el hip hop ahora muchos de esos ignorantes piensan que siendo gangtas van a hacerse ricos como 50 cent y esos y ese no es rap te aseguro que a 50 cente le preguntas que diferencia hay entre rap y hip hop y te va a decir que el hace hip hop..... Ahora otra cosa el rap no se trata de violencia y ya todos hacen batallas de mc′s creo que solo es para arreglar diferencias no para practicarlo a diario creo que la ignorancia aumenta y la verdadera cultura disminuye por que creen que nacio el reggaeton  el reggaeton es una copia de rap gangsta el mas bajo de los raps ahorita lei una pregunta de como sacar una maqueta y la fregada oye hermano el rap no es de internet ni de tu casita linda si no dela calleen internet solo tendras acceso a cybernautas y no a la verdadera gente de rap ahora ya de que salio el Porta todos los chamacos quieren ser Mc′s si supieran lo mal que rima porta??????? el solo tiene flow pero letra no tiene en ninguna oiganlas bien y ni se le entiende preferimos que seamos pocos pero que en verdad sepamos la verdadera cultura y no todo que denigren algo que nos ha costado mucho a lo largo de casi 40 a?os te apuesto a que muchos ni saben cuantos a?os tiene la cultura piensen usen la cabeza hagan las cosas con el corazon no con la mente cu?tura es cultura mierda es mierda|`|1UEpsqU0aa	realmente<br>  se ha quedado estancado<br>  a nivel nacional<br>  y no se ve por donde salga alante<br>  si te refieres a mundial<br>  en espa?a crecio a pasos agigantados<br>  igual en francia<br>  y estados unidos<br>  buenisimo<br>  pero bueno es cuestion de puntos de vista|`|850925d5eea75aed4bef37f807a4b48eaa	ASCENSO!!!|`|AVUUGKhuaa	Pues un poco de las dos, va en descenso porque ahora mucho mas gente lo escucha y hasta lo canta, aunque no sean parte de este genero, pero lo malo es que escuchan un rap que ni siquiera es rap, ya sabes, los mismos comerciales que en sus canciones no dicen nada, mas pseudomc's dentro de la cultura, etc...pero lo bueno es que poco a poco lo estan tomando mas en cuenta, ya le dan minimo un peque?o espacio al a?o, y muchos mas se estan dando cuenta que si vale la pena, que las letras realmente dicen algo no como otros creian, y eso ya es bueno, porque de poco a nada, preferimos poco..<br>  <br>  En resumen, va ascendiendo pero tiene sus peque?as caidas a las que se a logrado levantar..saludos.|`|QG9lQFg0aa	Lamentablemente va en ascenso y seguramente le quitará cada vez más lugar a mejores estilos de música.|`|VuV2vOAcaa	desenco por que hay chavos fresas que hoy en dia segun unas cadenas gorras y palleras flojas hacen a un rapero|`|Y7ULUwrtaa	en ascenso<br>  ojala i el rap i hip hop<br>  sea el genero musikal<br>  ke aplaste al rejeton|`|db82d25eb6d3483cd5174f47d883920daa	Para mi en los ultimos a?os tuvieron un GRAN ascenso.. realmente significativo.. y, como siempre luego de un gran escenso el ritmo del mismo disminua.. lo que no quiere decir que este en descensio... sino que simplemente no esta ascendiendo en la misma magnitud que hace un tiempo atras.... =)<br>  Ojala el ascenso continue!|`|lluofNELaa	a medida qe asciende la ignorancia, desciende el rap.<br>  ?porqe sera?|`|27IVZFW8aa	esta estancado en america latina y creo que poco a poco va en descenso ya que cada dia hay mas gente que se une a la moda de los punks, metaleros y fresitas, en estados unidos esta consolidado ya, es la musica mas escuchada alla, simplemente pon un programa de musica gringo y veras que pasan puro rap, espero y no desaparesca por completo, yo soy uno de los que siempre escuchara el rap..... suerte|`|NHS4inWgaa	ninguna!, no es moda..es una cultura! y muchos la siguen y otras no, asi es.<br>  <br>  bye!|`|1gBsNJ9Qaa	yo que sepa no van a desender|`|3RuOA6dUaa	aca en los eu y europa esta muy de moda y siguen saliendo talentos esta en acenso|`|7ac5d37810812c76643dfb50094e5bc8aa	Pues la vdd es que el hip-hop es la música más escuchada en el mundo, y si te fijas incluso en algunas canciones de pop, tienen influencia de rap, y pues solo le ponen una música más tiernita, asi como Julieta Venegas o Tiziano Ferro, a y además creo que los artistas raperos son muy talentosos,cualquiera pueda cantar esta música pero no cualquiera lo hace bien, a parte hay que tener talento para componer, bueno eso es lo que pienso.|`|MgNR9Q0Baa	Descenso, por q cada vez hay mas tontos q se hacen los raperos y son cualquier cosa: Timbaland, Jay-z, etc.<br>  El verdadero hip-hop no habla de lo mismo q el reggaeton, habla de los problemas q hay en la calle, la delincuencia y esas cosas.

Rental homes are a sign of a good economy.  it means people have that home as an investment.  many houses for sale can be a sign of a bad neighborhood or bad economy.|`|VgDwL3nkaa	Depends what the areas like... <br>  <br>  eg...

0pgk5ujTaa	Historia<br>  <br>  El grupo lo formaron cuatro amigos que no tenían mucho que hacer con su tiempo libre. Solían tocar covers (canciones de otras bandas) en ese entonces, hasta que empezaron a realizar sus propias composiciones inspirados en todo lo concerniente a su juventud, amigos, buenos momentos, fiestas y amor. Armaron un repertorio de varias canciones con las cuales grabaron un demo (Demo 1997). Fue entonces cuando obtuvieron un contrato con una disquera independiente, "Movic Records", a la edad de 18 a?os, sin embargo, el baterista David Castillo decide salir de la banda, siendo reemplazado por Jorge Vazquez.<br>  <br>  En el a?o 2001, sale a las tiendas su primer álbum titulado "Arroz con leche". El álbum pasó casi desarpecibido por la gente y los medios de comunicación. No fue hasta el 2002 con su segundo álbum "La revancha del príncipe charro" que por ser edición especial contenía un VCD en el que ofrecían una mezcla cómica y punk, que el grupo obtuvo popularidad.<br>  <br>  Después de varias giras de presentación de su segundo álbum, por México y Estados Unidos, Panda toma un descanso para componer su tercer disco. Fue entonces cuando Jorge Garza, conocido como Ongi, decide dejar la banda por cuestiones personales. En su lugar entró Arturo Arredondo.<br>  <br>  Su tercer álbum "Para ti con desprecio", fue sacado en el 2005 y es el álbum que ha tenido mayor popularidad en México y Latinoamérica, en este disco la banda abandonó el estilo pop punk que los caracterizaba. En el 2005 fueron nominados a una de las lenguas de los "MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamérica", en la categoría de mejor grupo de rock, consiguiendo el premio.<br>  <br>  A principios del 2006, Panda graba el tema "No te deseo el bien pero tampoco el mal" que fue parte de la banda sonora de la película Un Mundo Maravilloso. El 2 de octubre de 2006, se lanzó el cuarto álbum titulado Amantes Sunt Amentes (Amantes Son dementes); del cual su primer sencillo es "Narcisista por Excelencia" y que fue lanzado septiembre del mismo a?o. Con este CD, estuvieron en los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2006 el 19 de octubre de dicho a?o, y ganó 3 lenguas como mejor grupo de rock, mejor grupo o duo, y como artista revelación; tocando "Narcisista por excelencia" en vivo. El 14 de febrero del 2007 debuta su segundo single "Los malaventurados no lloran" en MTV.<br>  <br>  El 25 y 26 de noviembre de 2006 la banda grabó su primer DVD en vivo desde el Auditorio Nacional de México. En los 100 mas Pedidos de MTV del 2006, transmitidos en la última semana del a?o, su canción "Disculpa los malos pensamientos" obtuvo el primer puesto.<br>  <br>  En el 2006 se publica su canción "Si esto fuese realidad" para la serie mexicana "Skimo", producida por Nickelodeon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  + 10??

Well here's what the big shots have to say...<br>  <br>  Pat Buchanan:<br>  The chicken: to steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Louis Farrakhan:<br>  The egg, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken sat on "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Colonel Sanders:<br>  The chicken:  KFC has been around before you heard of eggs!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  L.A. Police Department:<br>  Give us five minutes with the chicken and the egg we'll find out soon enough!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Richard M. Nixon:<br>  The Egg, I repeat, the egg. I don't know any chickens. I have never known any chickens.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Dr. Seuss:<br>  Was it  the chicken?<br>  Was it the egg?<br>  Yes! Maybe its the chicken but if it is the egg I've not been told!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ernest Hemingway:<br>  They both came in the rain.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Martin Luther King, Jr.:<br>  I envision a world where all chickens will be free without the question of the eggs called into question.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Grandpa:<br>  In my day, we didn't ask who came first!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Aristotle:<br>  It is the nature of chickens to come first.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Karl Marx:<br>  It was a historical inevitability.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Saddam Hussein:<br>  This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on this question.<br>  -------------------------------<br>  George Bush:<br>  What chicken?  What egg?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Machiavelli:<br>  The point is that the chicken and the egg are both  food. Who cares who came first<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Freud:<br>  The fact that you are at all concerned about the chicken & the egg  reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Bill Gates:<br>  I have just released Chicken Coop 98, which will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook and Explorer is an inextricable part of the operating system.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Einstein:<br>  Did the chicken really come first or did the egg hide beneath the chicken???.<br>  --------------------------------------...|`|zYGJh5Odaa	the egg came first in order to become a chicken. <br>  da stupid.|`|s359lZj4aa	It depends on your belief. <br>  If you believe in evolution theory then the egg came first because something that was a LOT like a chicken laid an egg and the egg mutated and hatched into a chick.<br>  If you believe God created everything then the chicken came first because you'll believe that God created everything|`|4861f9e17bcef08d8f5e36f917de504eaa	Whatever you order first!

First of all...<br>  <br>  <br>  Kirk Hammet was the original guitarist in exodus, Mustaine was the original Metallica lead guitarist and was replaced by Kirk Hammet, not James Hetfield, because of his drinking problem. Cliff Burton did not write kill em all before he was in Metallica. That was mostly written by Hetfield and Mustaine.<br>  <br>  This video gives part of there early history <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-oQgpVg4I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq-oQgpVg...</a><br>  <br>  and just watch this <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GKTdarXjK4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GKTdarXj...</a><br>  <br>  btw Megadeth rules<br>  <br>  EDIT: You obviously don't know what your talking about, Poison was formed in 1983 where as metallica was formed in 1981, that doesn't even make any sense. Listen to the styles of guitar, they are nothing alike. If Cliff had the basic song structures then why would they only give him credit for writing one of them on there first album, which is of course pulling teeth. And seriously kid if you don't believe me on the stuff I've said above go to the metallica website, im sure they have a history or background page or something.

I mean, the change in color is obviously going to be noticed by your friends, so why not go for something that's noticeable even by others?<br>  <br>  I like these styles, personally:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n100/skybluefire/Hot%20Hair/hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n100/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh214/emo_grl1319/in.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh214...</a><br>  <a href="http://th01.deviantart.com/fs7/150/i/2005/261/3/7/my_rainbow_hair_by_littlehippy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://th01.deviantart.com/fs7/150/i/200...</a><br>  <br>  But if you want my opinion on a natural color, I think going for a nice auburn red would be nice. I'm seeing so many blondes and brunettes around that it's kind of overwhelming. Try something unique, and get a nice auburn or warm red.

Quizás tuvo algún tipo de relación con una mujer casada o en pareja.<br>  Porque para mi habla de un amor prohibido.<br>  El huiría porque ama, pero ella no puede para no dejar a su pareja... pero lo ama a él.<br>  Cómplices porque ambos saben que lo que hacen está mal. Prófugos por lo mismo... y porque a él le gustaría que ella deje todo por él.<br>  Ella le da excusas y pretextos para no ir con él y así dejar a su marido... Los ojos de ella hablan de el amor que siente por él, pero aún así no puede dejar a su pareja.<br>  <br>  Además Gustavo en la canción hace mención a uno de sus discos como es "Ruido Blanco" y ahí viene la canción "Prófugos", lo ha hecho en varias canciones.<br>  Sabe cómo hacerlo, es un grande!!!<br>  <br>  Tal vez son divagues míos, pero me parece que la canción habla de lo que mencioné párrafos arriba.<br>  <br>  Besos<br>  <br>  =)|`|1gBsNJ9Qaa	se trata de que quiere huir con ella|`|W2qycyfcaa	a que no seas tan cruel

AVUUGKhuaa	Para mi la Cultura Hip-Hop si es un estilo de vida, es una forma de vivir, por que es con lo que dia a dia convivo, y es un estilo de vida por que esto es real, es algo que te muestra la verdad y que por eso la gente, el gobierno, las disqueras, todos le sacan la vuelta, por que le tienen miedo a la verdad, no es una moda aunque esta cultura aya llegado a todo el mundo, es una forma de vivir porque para ser parte de esta cultura tienes que sentirlo, tienes que vivirlo, una moda llega y se va, pero esto desde que nació se a permanecido gracias a eso, a que es real y algo real no cae facilmente, desgraciadamente hay muchos que solo les llama la atencion esto y ya se siente parte de esto, porque vieron a un grupito en la tele y les gusto, pero no saben realmente como es este rollo. Es mi forma de vivir, de caminar, de pensar, de hablar, de todo, un estilo de vida como dije, eso para mi es la Cultura Hip-Hop.|`|0r4wEIyaaa	Mi libertad de expresarme mis  sentimientos mi amor a lo bello de la vida mi vida mi forma de ver la vida las cosas buenas y malas para mi el hip hop no es ser gangsta y eso para mi es dar un mensaje en el graffiti y en mi rap interesense por cosas asi es mejor para es ya casi como una religion pues en si vivo en el hip hop duermo con el hip hop y morire con el hip hop no nada mas con rap si con todo eso es hip hop union|`|1gBsNJ9Qaa	mira, pues para mi el hip hop no tiene "un fin ni una meta como cultura" solo una forma de expresion y ya, es musica, no una forma de vida solo porque habla de los problemas de la **** sociedad, no todos somos delincuentes, grafitteros callejeros, drogadictos y todas las lacras que la gente nos ve, y solo como nos vestimos, hablamos, la musica y como nos expresamos, somos diferentes por no estar de acuerdo con el gobierno y aun asi muchas veces no actuamos en contra de ello, por lo tanto con la sociedad, pero segimos formando parte de ella, no somos de la calle pero es mas facil expresarse alli dejando en muros lo que creemos y pensando diferente porque ahi no nos critican, el hip hop no tiene nada que ver con nuestra manera de ser, solo es musica inspirada, creada por y para nosotros, todos esos estereotipos de -delincuentes- los hemos hecho nosotros mismos, y asi queremos que nos tomen en cuenta. El rap y el hip hop son nuestra manera de pensar y para mi es la unica que me interesa, los esteroitopos de vida que todo el mundo sigue son los mismos (apartando algunos grupos) y por eso son todos igual, algunos en cambio queremos ser originales entre nosotros mismos. Esta es mi opinion, Hip Hop no es la cultura, es la musica de nuestra cultura que terminamos siendo nosotros, y no por ello somos los delicuentes ni la bandera de rebeldia y desacato que todos pintan, somos personas para una vida diferente, que fue al fin y al cabo la que nosotros mismos elegimos.<br>  Arriba el Hip Hop y el Rap, ojala mi respuesta te sirva|`|KmYxpnQXaa	no se como te lo digo pero es como un desmadre la libertad de la música ?una liberación!!<br>  si entiendes ?no?|`|NHS4inWgaa	ps la neta! es mi vida!!.. practico breakdance!, y me encanta esta cultura!.<br>  te agrego como amiga!! ;)<br>   <br>  bye!<br>  <br>  hiphop is off da hook!!|`|lbzfPoQWaa	TODO

tgYEXN8Gaa	Yes I've seen it, and in answering this question, I am going to assume that it is her.  That picture absolutely horrifies, saddens and disgusts me.  Chris Brown, in my opinion,  is an absolute disgrace, and I hope he goes to jail (even though he more than likely won't).  The look on Rhianna's face makes me want to cry for her; it's such a look of shame and sadness.  I don't believe a woman should ever be hit, and I feel very strongly about this.  People who are saying that "oh, I hate Rihanna coz I hate her music, therefore she deserved this" are sick people.  Also silly fans who are conding this behaviour purely because it invovles Chris Brown are complete idiots.  Nobody, in particular, no woman deserves this.  I know that I will never download another Chris Brown song, sing along to another Chris Brown song, and when (if) a Chris Brown song comes onto the radio, I will switch stations.  <br>  <br>  I also felt disgusted at his attempt at an apology, and I bet he is mostly only sorry because of the damage to his career he has caused.  Also, I hated his hiding behind God and his pastor in it.  <br>  <br>  I hope Rihanna takes all the time she needs to recover mentally and physically and does not go back to Chris, to show males and females everywhere that this type of behaviour is not acceptable, and I wish her all the best of luck.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	i think chris brown should now be NAMED BROWN CHRIS THE CRACK HEAD ...and he was wrong to hit Rhianna but im surprised he didnt break his fist hitting her the forehead ... he has made it bigger than it was before she wouldn't be able to use an UMBRELLA she will need a two man tent to keep her dry =/|`|S1jddreQaa	Yeah, I thought that he just hit her, but he did way wose then I thought.|`|f6qmRicQaa	I think the photo's are a little grainy and probably don't show the full extent of the damage he did.  i'm glad they were released, I am sick of the freaking groupies defending him, and finding excuses for his behavior.  I hope they will see there is no defense for what was done to her, I hope they make a big public example out of him.|`|58UB5lqRaa	Yes i think its disgusting that a man can do that to a woman because <br>  she was upset at him texting another, i hope she presses charges against him, He says hes sorry tough he didnt think that when he did it and left her in the street alone. sorry does not make up for the pain she is going through|`|WJX994D2aa	It's disgusting. I hope he gets put in jail for a long time.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for Rihanna with it being published though, i bet she's outraged.<br>  <br>  Apparently whoever released them is going to be in BIG trouble.|`|r7EW2cwwaa	Well I have to say that i kind of disagree with what people are saying. Ok the picture did come out but people don't know anything about adding to the picture. Some people dont know if someone could of fixed the picture up to make her look bad know one really knows the full story and i think that people should stop judging him and they dont even know the full story of what happened. Now I'm not saying that he didn't do it. And I am disappointed at the fact that something like this could of happen.I think no man should hit a women at all but then the other side of me is saying that if a women trys to challenge a men and get in there face like they are a men then that women needs to either control herself and be the bigger person or then she will be challenge as a women. Then at the same time the man should get another women to come handle things but at the same time the other women has nothing to do with anything. But all I am saying is that no one knows what really happen that afternoon there is proof and evidence but I would believe more of the story if the cops would check for finger prints and do more investagtion. And I want more people to stop judging chris and rihanna because you never know if rihanna and the other women got the fighting and chris brown could of stop it or rihanna said something and chris brown didn't like it and he hit her. My point is you can't make people chose who you want them to. Either way your going to like chris brown and your going to like rihanna so either way they both are still going to have fans no matter what happen that mess up afternoon people are still going to love them and admire them.|`|p1zhfeedaa	i think its bad but honestly after hearing the whole story, you have to look at is from both sides and not from the picture. Chris was wrong to hit her but it Rhianna forgives him and hes sorry for what he did then were just going to have to see what happens later on.|`|saHtFuxiaa	Well this is one of the most disgusting thing that anyone ever could have come across. Hitting your woman is never acceptable under any circumstances. <br>  <br>  It's sad still a girl like rihanna has to go through these terrible problems.|`|EC2TSFj3aa	The scumbag is done for good.

1gBsNJ9Qaa	yo creo que en USA, muchos generos se derivaron del jazz, creado por la raza negra cuando dejaron de discriminarlos, esta musica se mezclo con ritmos urbanos y salieron los demas generor. Repito -eso creo-   jaja|`|CiJBhYEkaa	Los ****** americanos la inventaron|`|1099c9b55bbabdd08747b8bfa4d39b52aa	El Rhythm & Blues (R&B)  es un género surgido com variante rítmica del blues ***** a fines de los a?os cuarentas y principios de los cncuentas del siglo XX en Estados Unidos. Contiene elementos del jazz de New Orleans y gospel.<br>  <br>  El Soul es un género de raíces más complejas pero esencialmente contiene los elementos del "***** spiritual" y el gospel de los templos donde lo cantaban los afroamericanos durante la celebración del culto. Se pueden observar dos variantes: la de Detroit, ligera y pop cultivada por la disquera Motown (con artistas como The Temptations, y The Four Tops) y la versión más cruda, auténtica y llena de "alma" ("soul" en inglés)  de Memphis promovida por la competencia de Motown, Stax Volt con artistas tan importantes como Otis Redding y Etta James.<br>  <br>  El Hip Hop no solo nombra un género  musical sino un estilo de vida de los barrios ****** del Bronx en New York. Proviene de la adaptación de los ritmos jamaiquinos (toasting), elementos de la música funk y sonido Filadelfia (que dio también origen a la música disco) a mediados de los a?os 70's.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, a principios de los noventas ya se dieron algunas fusiones de los tres estilos y el resultado se conoció como "New Jack Swing"|`|ITSSUanAaa	El hip-hop nace a partir del reggae, fueron paises del caribe los que le siguieron la tendencia mas que de USA Negra, por que asi es como yo considero el hip-hop, una musica que nos da una identidad etnica cultural. Tambien se tiene como lugar de nacimiento del hip-hop el Bronx en new york. Recuerda que si usas hip-hop para referirte a musica tambien entran alli el reggaeton, el rap y el dance y ?quien sabe que mas? por que el hip-hop es toda la cultura fundada en las cuatro bases: Rap, Break dance, graffiti, y Djing.

iEvHediaaa	Hola! el R&B, Rithm and blues es mi estilo favorito de música, te voy a hablar un poco de el.<br>  <br>  Resumiendo mucho, el R&B es un género musical derivado en su origen del jazz, el gospel y el blues. El término musical fue introducido en Estados Unidos en 1949 por Jerry Wexler de la revista Billboard.[1] Sustituyó al término conocido como "race records" (grabaciones de raza), considerado ofensivo para la posguerra mundial)[2] así como para la categoría de Billboard "Harlem Hit Parade" en junio de 1949, y principalmente era usado para identificar el estilo musical que más tarde se desarrollaría en forma de rock and roll. Pero el R&B origen, conocido hoy como classic Rhythm & Blues, no tiene prácticamente relación con su evolución actual más conocida, el mainstream R&B.<br>  <br>  Aqui te dejo el link de una página donde puedes encontrar mas informaíón y mas completa sobre este género musical, por si te interesa.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_&_Blues" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_&_Bl...</a><br>  <br>  En la actualidad hay muchos artistas de R&B, Craig David, Beyonce, Usher, Alicia Keys, Ne yo, Mario Winanns, r kelly, Rihana, Ashanti.....<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado, besos desde Madrid, Lydia|`|WNZXFSq1aa	Rap para gente de Color.<br>  es algo como Rap y una mezcla de Jazz|`|iMzg0oTfaa	R&B: Rithm and Blues. Es el blues clásico americano, la música negra, el auténtico folclore afroamericano, nacido de las viejas canciones de los esclavos traídos de áfrica, la esencia misma de todo el rock actual, como digo siempre... LA MADRE DEL CORDERO. Prácticamente toda la música actual que escuchamos está basada en sus armonías y ritmos.|`|1gBsNJ9Qaa	yo solo quiero explicar que no es MUSICA NEGRA, la musica no tiene color y no es para CADA color, porque las personas de diferentes colores podemos escoger entre la musica que nos guste, y aunque el R&B haya sido creada por gente de color no significa nada, solo son ritmos de jazz, blues y hip hop que se fusionaron y asi siguieron surgiendo mas y nuevos generos|`|WHlp7U2Zaa	R&B significa Rap y Black,es musica negra y Rap o hip-hop, es mi musica favorita,con el dance,el progressive y el techno,un saludo.|`|ec2bfa8558384a202244a87f1048be71aa	Significa "Rhythm and Blues" y es una de las 3 raíces del Rock′n Roll, las otras 2 son el Gospel y el Country. De las 3 raíces del Rock 2 son de origen ***** y sólo el Country de origen blanco. Y se puede citar al doo-wop como predecesor del R&B.  <br>  En su forma clásica y pura el R&B es muy anterior al rap o hip-hop que son  subgéneros posteriores que también suelen inscribirse en el R&B. En lo personal descubrí en el R&B de la década del 60 temas excelentes que repetidamente vuelven tal como eran o como nuevas versiones con arreglos típicos de cada época, a mi juicio no hubo en décadas posteriores a la de los 60 tanta diversidad y talento.|`|32a48eff15f623b7281eed8fbb2e6e4caa	el R&B es un genero mas bien nacido de una mezcla entre el hip-hop y el blues es algo muy movido, pegajoso y asu vez callejero un ejemplo de R&B podriamos poner a R.Kelly, usher, j.lo, beyonce, outkast, tlc|`|96b73182e1beb16dc563b9a5aae75e57aa	pues sincramente soy una pasionada de esta musica de echo la llevo escribiendo desde peke?ita..ejej y  significa RAP & Blues osea el fusionamiento de estos dos genreos dan lugar a esa musica..un beso espero haberte sido de ayuda|`|BaMLfEgeaa	R&B significa Ritmo&Blues.|`|tpQK8BTwaa	Es musica negra, muchas veces se introducen en las canciones algo de hip hop.

Ridiculizan cualquier acto cotidiano, como pueda ser que una mujer se corte el pelo o engorde.<br>  El problema es que este tipo de programas mueve mucho dinero directa e indirectamente, y eso hace que funcionen las clinicas de estetica, de adelgazamiento, las revistas de moda, las tiendas de ropa y complementos, las agencias de viajes.  Inconscientemente nos dejamos influir por esas modas que nos inculcan que tenemos que ser como las personas que salen en la tele, y cada vez nos frustramos mas, hasta el momento en que conviertes tu vida en ese tipo de programas, y nunca es suficiente.  Y como hay poco dinero para gastar, cuando ya lo hemos gastado en esas estupideces, cuando necesitamos algo ya no podemos permitirnos el lujo de tenernos, y asi pedimos un credito, tras otro, hasta que al final acabas sentado siempre en el sofa, porque no te puedes permitir el lujo de pagar nada de lo que "necesitas" y frustrado te sientas a escuchar las penas de los demas y a pensar que tu vida no es tan miserable, y te satisfaces viendo como destripan a los demas, mientras pagas tus deudas.|`|SJld7t2Saa	si los programas de farandula siguen al aire en la TV abierta quiere decir que la gente los ve, que les gusta el morbo, quiero decir que mucha gente se "obseciona" con esto y quieren saber todo acerca de sus estrellas favoritas o de los personajes de la tele.|`|c97b6e2044d2e95df9fc454202f18135aa	Coincido plenamente con vos...

IhUdQJWhaa	ninguna es mejor que otra. las dos son talentosas. ahora, si hablamos de voz; cristina se lleva el premio, pero para que queremos con esa voz (que medio que grita) si tenemos a un monton. ej.:Shakira. Britney, en cambio tiene una voz un poco unica, es decir particular, que la caracteriza.  ninguna persona llego a estar a la altura de madonna. madonna misma salio con una remera avisando quien era su heredera. pero claro, con todos los problemas que tuvo Britney,  todos la pasan como la lokita. pero no es asi, no quiero decir que estuvo bien pero si ustedes se ponen un momento en el lugar de ella quiza lo comprenden.  no es por ser fan de britney ni de cristina.<br>  ademas,  britney tiene muy lindo cuerpo. britney dice; soy sexi, mirenme! en vez cristina lo oculta.  tambien, ademas de su cuerpo, Britney baila hermoso. yo a cristina nunca la vi bailar (bien).  esta es mi opinion;           SI. es mejor, por como baila, canta y por su cuerpo. sus sexi videos y etc. <br>  OJALA BRITNEY SE RECUPERE, TENGO FE EN ELLA Y QUE VUELVA A SER LO QUE SIEMPRE FUE; LA PRINCESA DEL POP-<br>  Y... OJALA QUE CRISTINA SIGA ASI. BIEN, COMO SIEMPRE<br>  <br>  aqui van unas palabritas:<br>  no critiques la vida de los demas, porque solo demuestras que eres un infeliz en la tuya, por lo que debes desahogarte en la de los demas.  no juzjes equivocadamente.<br>  <br>  suerte  a las dos.        bye           tony|`|0ucDiYF0aa	CADA UNO TIENE LO SULLO.

1gBsNJ9Qaa	para mi mejor que ellos den el primer paso, porque supongo que a la mayoria de las mujeres son las que no nos gusta sentirnos rechazadas o quedar en verguenza, como que si nosotras empezamos y el no nos acepta, nos hace sentir idi0tas y pues es mejor saber de antemano si somos de su gusto, estar seguras que no nos vamos a equivocar, y podemos estar mas seguras de eso si dejamos que el hombre comienze, yo entiendo que sientas temor al rechazo, pero antes de eso debes tratar a las mujeres y despues acercarse mas a quien te guste y mantener una buena relacion, con eso se sentira el amor mutuo y ya no habra razones para sentir temor, y piensa que si todo lo haces con ese miedo, no llegaras a hacer nada, hay que arriesgarse, sino no ganas, no es malo pero puedes intentar ser mas aventado, aunque si encontrras mujeres que den el primer paso, pero tu tambien debes ayudar<br>  <br>  <br>  salu2|`|Vj3RaiA4aa	para mi es mucho mejor que ellos den el primer paso porque soy algo timida pero creeme que por ahi hay muchas que dan el primer paso,suerte y ojala te tropiezes con una de ellas.|`|nnMJDpjiaa	Eso depende de la mujer algunas son un poco timidas y otras no, tambien depende de que tanto nos gusta el chico...|`|O2bsDh90aa	hola ranz!!!pues yo con mi chico fui la que dio el primer paso...pero es segun se den las cosas si las dos personas no son extrmadisisisimamente timidas entonces tarde o temprano una de las dos se declarara.<br>  <br>  kisses<br>  ______________________________<br>  sebas t amo|`|a8656e6da2ac99d341c7a951cae2bbc9aa	no te creas que es tan así, hay muchisimas chicas que dan el primer paso,  en realidad es siempre, lo que cambia es la sutiliza con que lo hagan|`|awXm8Xdraa	?POKE o por qué?...aaay pobrecitos ellos!...si como escribes das el primer paso y haces todo, mejor sigue sin arriesgarte eh, nadie se está perdiendo de nada.<br>  Por favoooor, te sobra una tilde y son 2 palabras  -por- favor, no "pórfavor".|`|4vYWjNg8aa	bueno, por lo menos a mi me gusta que el hombre de el primer paso, depende de lo que sea, pero hay mujeres que son arriesgadas y lo dan, simplemente porque se ve como que mas bonito que el hombre se declare o que se yo, dependiendo de lo que que sea, claro.|`|99dea10619143b66ca84b9a70b33c3a6aa	Quiza sea por mero prejuicio, ya que durante muchos a?os se había pensado que si dabas el primer paso eras una lanzada y una facilota... pero creo que ya la situacion ha cambiado, y si un chavo nos late, podemos facilmente dar el primer paso... claro, sin vernos tan lanzadas ;) jejejeje...<br>  <br>  Ademas, igual es por el mismo motivo que tu comentas, miedo al rechazo... uno nunca sabe!<br>  <br>  n_n<br>  Saluditos|`|aaPMIubQaa	bueno....mi novio era mi amigo timido...y un dia se armo de valor y me lo dijo (via msn)y somos novios, asi que si te da vergüenza decirselo en persona por msn o sms ,mucha suerte y adelante;)|`|c7b17d62b601b3ce6a4067e1e813fbb5aa	por favor, cuida tu ortografía, he tardado media hora en entender tu pregunta...<br>   respecto a la cuestión en sí, sólo te digo q yo he dado el primer paso muchas veces, hasta me divierte!|`|dTyfxqvFaa	Em...

oNdKKW6Paa	Sakura Haruno<br>  <br>  Sakura Haruno is the sole female member of Team 7.As a child, Sakura was taunted by other children for her particularly large forehead,but was comforted by Ino Yamanaka. As the two continued to grow, however, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. During most of Naruto original series, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke, and spurns the advances of Naruto Uzumaki. After Sasuke leaves the village, she resolves to become stronger by training with Tsunade. In Naruto Shippuden, she displays highly developed skills from her training, and a more open disposition towards Naruto.<br>  <br>  Here is a picture of what she looks like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nautiljon.com/images/perso/grandes/Naruto/sakura_haruno.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautiljon.com/images/perso/gr...</a><br>  <br>  Naruto Rocks!!!!!|`|DuJXr2vvaa	Her name is Sakura Haruno.

But, given the choice, I would never choose unrest over love.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you meant for me to choose the ONE of the four I would want, then I say love. I yearn desperately for peace, but I could never live without the love of another: be it a best mate or husband. I would literally die of loneliness if I chose peace and not love.<br>  <br>  So, now that I''ve thoroughly confused the subject, I can say, without further hesitation, that I do and will choose love over all else. I can survive all other conditions--good or bad--so long as there is someone to share time with.|`|4Tbi3TdUaa	Love.<br>  cause Love is patient, love is kind, Love bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

lpyWVR2oaa	First thing i noticed is the heavy Watery influence in this individual. generally, those with heavy water placements are prone to all kinds of emotional ups and downs, mood swings as Water is the most sensitive element and they pick up vibes that affect them too easily.<br>  <br>  Now, when you say he has a tendency to self-destruct and self-sabotage, that is actually a inherent trait of Sun sign Scorpios. But there are other indications that lead to this and I'm looking mainly at the hard aspects involving the Moon (esp. since it is the Chart Ruler).<br>  <br>  Moon opposite Uranus is one such tough aspect (I have this placement too so i know how it feels). When he has reached a certain level of emotional comfort, the unpredictable Uranus energy will start pulling him out of his comfort zone and crave for more excitement. Mars conjunct Moon may trigger him to act aggressively and decisively on what he desires but when Mars opposes Uranus, there is unpredictability related to his actions too. <br>  <br>  It makes him seem rather unreliable, fickle-minded and vacillating to those who don't understand that he is facing his own inner emotional battlegrounds within. This is most evidently portrayed in the relationships with others and discord and disharmony in relationships is a common feature of such aspects.

Seriously as you said it:nobody gave a rat's-*** about him and now,all of a sudden he is the greatest actor who walked the Earth.|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Hes a great actor and as a supporting actor in Batman, he did an outstanding job, incredible. I also think he's getting this far because he died last year. A bit overated i say because everybody feels so sad about his death. Dont get me wrong, hews an amazing actor but he's just not worthy of an Oscar just by a little bit.but Congrats if he gets it, the mentality that he had to create for his character who was a freak was jsut plain scary and awesome.|`|MI3r3jWeaa	I did like him in the Dark Knight movie [loved it] and he was a good actor in my opinion [not great] but seriously if he hadn't of died, he wouldn't have been so special to people.

Do you know how much money The Dark Knight made it in the box office in the US? Let's say it de crowned Star Wars, a 1970s movie, with about 587 million dollars. Titanic still stands number for for 602 million. VERY CLOSE. <br>  <br>  Heath's performance was VERY professional & not just this film. He also got an Oscar nomination for Brokeback Mountain. Kissing another guy when you're not gay, & for the sake of acting--THAT'S a true actor. When he didn't win the Oscar that year, he claimed he was happy & relieved, if he did, photographers will be on his tail. Now this is his second nomination & he isn't here to share it with us. That's what makes it sad & that's why we're proud he's nominated the second time. <br>  <br>  Dude, i totally respect your opinion. In fact, i've heard worse people saying that they're glad he's dead for some stupid reason. It's just he left in a time like this, he never even got to see The Dark Knight himself. He died on January 22 2008, the movie premiered in July 16 2008. He left this world with a 3 year old daughter, just one daughter--who looks the exact spitting image of him.

bribxhsdaa	Because the word mainstream has a scary connotation for a lot of the people who frequent this section.    When i say mainstream, Instead of thinking:    The Wu-Tang Clan  Common  NaS   etc.    They think Soulja Boy, Plies, Shawty Lo, Ace Hood, Lil Wayne who AT THE MOMENT are poster boys for mainstream music based on the amount of radio play they're currently recieving.    People ask non RHH questions here to get the perspective of Rap and Hip Hop fans on Non rap and hip hop topics.    FYI - What is there to appreciate about Soulja Boy or Flo Rida. I mean, I'll suffer their music in a club or something. But as material for music appreciation they're anus.     On that note, The underground is overrated..People make out like it's some parralel universe where everyone is the second coming of every great MC but there is just as much trash there as there is in the mainstream. Only difference being it stays underground so it gets less exposure.     I like mainstream..within reason.|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	i like some T.I n luda. i like them casue thats a bit lyrical. i mean soulja boy is like party music. only time when people like that is in a party but, listening to it 24/7. it gets boring. i mean people do wanna get low low low in a party but, all the time????|`|jfEb0tIJaa	Well its because I love the arts and really appreciate it when an artist can overwhelm me with their creativity.      Now the people (NOT ARTISTS) you've named are nothing but corporate shills who are ALL about  MARKETING products in their lyrics, their videos so you the pion masses will by their stupid useless crap.  Apple Bottom jeans, rocking and stomping in my air force ones.  Its   not art.  That goes for most pop music these days its all about getting more of your money.    That's the biggest tragedy is that people have no idea now the diff between marketing and what art really is.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I don't hate mainstream artists, I just hate the crappy ones (like the ones you mentioned). I listen to a lot of mainstream rappers.    Nas  Ice Cube  A Tribe Called Quest  Wu Tang Clan  N.W.A.  Pac  Bone Thugs  Common  Cypress Hill  Dr. Dre  DMX  Geto Boys  Jay-Z  Kanye West  Mobb Deep  Outkast  Snoop Dogg  Too Short|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Its not that most of us HATE mainstream.  The truth is that most of the mainstream music today lacks the lyricism that we used to hear even a couple of years ago.  I appreciate the music of today but when having more money means you get more radio play, instead of listeners getting to choose it kind of irritates me.  When I lived in Dallas and even in OKC they didn't even have a request line anymore.    Thats what I don't like.  I can't call and request a song because the DJs are getting paid to play Lil Wayne every ten minutes.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	just ignore it    Have a nice day    How about you start asking mainstream question so all the Lil Wayne stans can  have somewhere to go :||`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Not true. I see a lot of diversity here in the questions.   I think it's not really that serious either.   Chill out.  And, you answer with cruelty and sarcasm I've seen, so.....|`|mBQQL0kCaa	they think hip hop is susposed to be a certain way which is wrong|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	I think it's a common misconception that:    Mainstream = songs about drugs, sex, cars, clothes, hoes, etc    underground = songs about social injustice, politics, etc    Which is not necessarily true for either.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Answering your questions....    1) Not everyone hates mainstream artists.    2) Yes, there's a radio in my house and car.    3)   a) Non RHH questions delves into a personal level, and some people are curious about other regs.    b) Maybe because they don't like Soulja Boy, FloRida, 50 or Lil' Wayne.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	Most of the mainstream sucks, and most people are haters, so you do the math...    EDIT:  My bad...I didn't see the sarcasm and cruelty part until after I answered...|`|XDvOwLlNaa	Most of it is unoriginal crap...I wouldn't call them "artists"    Art should be timeless...will you be listening to Flo Rida in 10 years?...most mainstream fans just jump on whatevers hot atm...they forget anything older then a few months

Voice like rubbing two steel pipes together.|`|LcRKHa0Gaa	I dunno. I saw her in the newspaper crying because of Jade's wedding dress but I've never heard about her before. Maybe her and Jade didn't contact until now?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10077992	Poor Jackiey ! Jade has said previously that SHE had to look after her mum,who was a drug addict ,as was her dad (since died)<br>  Jackiey had a motorbike crash which left her with a useless arm.<br>  Jade virtually brought herself up but since Jade's been ill, her mum has been very good to her and the boys|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	They are very close but Jade has always had to look after her Mum because she was a junkie and lost an arm in a motorbike accident.  Now the tables are turned and I think her Mum can't cope with losing her daughter either.  They have both had a hard life but even more so Jade with coping with junkie parents at the age of 5 onwards.

EuwjIJ3Zaa	That's interesting!  I found this good article on it, that might help explain.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.janetboyer.com/Midheaven_in_Cancer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.janetboyer.com/Midheaven_in_C...</a><br>  <br>  Cancer at the midheaven, is at it's opposite home in the IC. According to what I've found on that, once Cancer Midheaven finds what makes them tick, they gain genuine emotional fulfillment by following through with that in their lives.  The Midheaven represents the highest culmination of ourselves, and Cancers is based on security and emotional fulfillment, so their career may very well make them happy, and feel secure in their work environment.<br>  <br>  You can look at that in it's opposite to understand; Capricorn at the midheaven.  Often times, people with Capricorn at their midheaven, or strong Capricorn influence in their 10th house, often find that they need to sacrifice parts of their lives, and be literally stripped away emotionally, before they feel at peace with themselves, and their place in the world. That article describes it as "rough and tumble" for the Capricorn experience.<br>  <br>  However, I think the attention wh0re description of a Cancer midheaven, just like anyother cardinal point on the birthchart, needs lots of aspects towards it, before it really sticks out so clearly.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Needy perhaps. I could see needy. Not Attention H0..dramatic neediness...."Oh, please, someone save me.....!!!!" type of thing.<br>  <br>  I would look to a Leo in Mars, Ascendant or Midheaven for that...the sign of the actor.

Don't be so frightened, bollywood will survive many such flops.|`|sxk08R2caa	no- i think bollywood is on the up with teens because of the CG movie that just came out. yeah that one had loads of bollywood in it so teens are gonna want to find out more about it and maybe see some bollywood movies.|`|XPw8wvOraa	Recession is the reason.<br>  <br>  People are watching either by downloading or by piracy <br>  <br>  DevD is a hit by the way!|`|Oggpkk3Uaa	watch online bollywood movies, watch and download songs at<br>  <a href="http://www.freedekho.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedekho.com</a><br>  <br>  no popups|`|pwSD6WvRaa	Yep.. bollywood... is that contagious?|`|uzAS4OUqaa	Bollywood has lost its charm it once had. Earlier the stories always revolved around action, or karan johar and/or yash chopra's family value alongside love, or jus plain comedy of errors. The industry  is even saturated with re-makes. At one point, movies were hit coz of its' songs. Almost everythin possible has been tried out includin animation and graphic stuff. <br>  Audiences are tired of it all. Unless something really solid comes out, bollywood aint gonna progress this year too. <br>  As of now, the only thing runnin on tv which keeps them in business is reality shows.

FavaF3ioaa	Yes, awesome present! I got some Ugg boots for my Birthday last year, and I was over the moon!  They died, so I got a new pair last month, they're every girly girls dreams.|`|eybHcHz9aa	That depends entirely on your sister. Pisces are meant to be stylish dressers, so Uggs may be a bit on the silly side. They aren't meant for frequent wear because they lack proper ankle support. In a normal boot you expect to be "held" in by the sides, but in an ugg, you put your foot on the bottom but your legs from the ankle up aren't hugged in.   The furry bits are warm, but so is wearing thick socks.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	I am pisces (triple) and I would absolutely hate to have ugg boots for my birthday!  Check her rising sign, mine is scorpio.  Thermal socks would go down a treat just now, mine are all worn out.   My ideal  boots - footwear for pisces theme - are Ecco Runners, same shape as Ugg less butt uggly.    I am guessing from your comment that you have already bought them. lol|`|pf8OEAG6aa	nobody wears those anymore..|`|WU7xMQCyaa	Yes I think you should get them, she will be pleased|`|mKfQQRDuaa	UGG BOOTS ARE NOT GOOD, REGARDLESS OF THE SIGN!

MoKUZuQraa	They're all pretty good. Yeah faces of the heart is amazing. However, my favorite Dave Koz CD is saxophonic. So if you get a chance or maybe you already have, I would check that out.
NGNeT3rYaa	Yes, the theme is pretty much the same, they just upped the tempo.
2QHdaOLkaa	If you believe in star signs, you should consider your star sign too.<br>  <br>  I would say no. Socrpios can be very passionate and mysterious (and good in bed), but they have a lot of issues. They are usually jealous and possessive, and they are VERY vindictive, they even hold small things against you forever and throw it at you later on. They are very bad to argue with, and unreasonable. They are very sensitive but don't usually show it as they clam up in an annoying way. They are very stubborn, will always think they are right and feel you have been unfair to them if you stick to your opinion. But they can do very romantic things as well, to surprise you and stuff.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kind of person could live with this (a fling is another story), but apparently there are star signs that are compatible with this!|`|nr9q4XvNaa	Why not? I grew up with some Scorpio relatives around(I'm a Leo Sun)and I'm pretty much familiar with their common traits. I don't mind possessiveness and jealousy..as long as it's not too much that i feel like a prisoner instead of a partner/lover. As long as he have what i'm looking for in a man.. and that we have connection and compatibility(and what i mean by this is that we can stand one another even at bad times..),in fact i would love to experience dating every man in each signs! (Even those signs i'm not compatible with! lol)|`|aPBXvM0Gaa	The Scorpio male is said to be the epitome of the strong and silent type...although he is never at a loss for words on the right occasion. Intensely emotional yet reticent in his expression of affection, others should not be misled by this man's apparently thick skin. At heart, he is a sensitive soul. Because of this, jealousy could be the Scorpio male's worse fault and he will need a partner who has eyes for nobody else but him. This man is almost certain to be in a career that requires specialization...surgery, industrial design or police detection, for example. Therefore, his work will always come first. Possessed of a wry and sometimes cruel wit, this is essentially a kind-hearted man who is blessed with a philosophical turn of mind. He is cognizant of the favorably appealing affect he has on anyone attracted to him, but often acts aloof since he would rather hunt than be hunted. As a sweetheart, he is intense and moody, liable to chase his quarry with much determination. However, if kept at bay too long, this male is likely to hate instead of love or lose interest very suddenly. As a life partner, he will be extremely occupied with his family and home, although he may not always give this impression. Details usually fail to interest the Scorpio male and he is quite content to leave the mundane responsibilites to his partner. However, when it comes to such things as the education of a child or that child's developing personality, then the man ruled by Scorpio will throw himself whole-heartedly into the project.<br>  <br>  Typically an old-fashioned individual, this man is not always easy to live with since he can be overbearing. He expects a partner to be receptive to his every thought and follow his instructions with total obedience. Usually a successful soul, the male governed by Scorpio is well able to support a family, but his intensely personal passion and highly possessive attitude may prove to be something of a strain on loved ones. Indeed, no matter how much love and devotion this man receives, it is in his nature to be secretive and suspicious. In short, he will almost always suspect that deceptive conditions are working against him, even though such conditions usually do not exist and are largely imaginative in origin. The depth of this male's affection for loved ones is genuine but he cannot seem to learn how to be more pliable. The man ruled by Scorpio is prone to indulge in excesses. His desires may often be unnatural...and even gross...but nonetheless, demand satisfaction. However, since this male tends to suffer deeply from his indulgences, he is apt to make inward promises of temperance once the appetites have been satiated.|`|AA11330115	I'm married to a Scorpio...and I am an Aquarius...two signs that are opposing, or so I'm told....And after 8 years, I can understand why they are opposing!!|`|1IB2vFFVaa	hmmmm... let me think about that!!!!!!! Are you a total **** head or just a gaay one|`|rvBZPIv4aa	I'm a scorpio...I have never really been bothered by anybody's horoscope.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	Scorpio men can be very sweet. I've been with two and they are very passionate. I broke up with one of them because he was too jealous, but I loved him. And the other one moved. He wasn't as jealous as the first one but I cared about him a lot..<br>  <br>  They're not that bad once you get to know them...<br>  <br>  ?|`|Bi51WJd7aa	Hyperthetically speaking (because I am currently engaged), I would date a guy whom I like and feel an attraction to regardless of his star sign. Imagine missing out on being with the 'possible' love of your life because you are too caught up with STAR SIGNS! Pretty dumb, don't you think?? I don't really believe in them and I think following them to the tee or taking them extremely seriously is not particularly intelligent. I have read my Horoscope for fun at times and I can tell you that it's made up of either bullsh!t or pure coincidence.<br>  <br>  I am Libra for the record.|`|CIhpkxGyaa	i don't care about whether he is scorpio or whatever because that has nothing to do with anything|`|5RhDnLHLaa	anything but a leo|`|1LwHRjTnaa	:S how bout leos? haha|`|nISWmpq2aa	look dear , girls would like to date anybody whose not a flirt and is kind and caring at heart, cos thats what important. And i must tell u that scorpios r passionate, helpful, caring, ambitious and loving. On the negative side-- they become jealous and like to get into the root of everything that might be not that important.So if we omit those negative things i think they are great plas to make friends. Girls would defenately like them,i bet!!!<br>  Best wishes,<br>  reva|`|eT6SsCaraa	Yes, ^__^ I'm dating one now <3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But, If I weren't taken, I would date regardless of sign.. there's a lot more to a person than their sun sign, and if we like each other, than I will give him a chance. :) <br>  <br>  But... Leos and Gemini.. just no.|`|iDfEBcgHaa	Absolutely.  I know as a Sagittarius I'm not supposed to be compatible with a Scorpio, but they're just so sexy and intense.  I find Scorpios irresistable.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Never in a million gazillion years.  Even if you were the last man on earth.  <br>  <br>  Scorpio men = bad<br>  <br>  Watch out for that tail.

I know that doesn't really make sense literally...but you understand.|`|AA10409668	I don't believe that there is just one special person for each individual.  I do believe that anyone can find love.  ---------------------------|`|AA11656632	Yes, there is someone for everyone|`|hEAuWYYjaa	there is not a perfect person for anyone so the person that people call "the one" is a lie because 1-2 families are divorced and moving on all of the time and will never find someone that they truely love forever|`|WyjRm10jaa	Maybe not at this earth..  Maybe there is Someone Special in the Heaven..|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	That just isn't true.

I guess I pretty much agree with it, or atleast I like the idea of it.   .|`|qI7T8jFeaa	hmm.. not real sure what to think of it.. like it though good poet ..

Nuff said.|`|DqbLx3hxaa	I think there is more than 1 person for everyone.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	hmmm.. lol|`|Yo0vuP8Gaa	I agree it is totally false. It is following the predestine theory which some Calvinistic and Augustinian Christians believe. That too is false. It means that everything that happens is Gods fault. What about the Secret and the law of attraction. You create your own future within the framework of chance, Gods guidance, others interferance and you all powerful thoughts and choices...   There is many people who would fit for you in a match. Go out and find them by focusing on what you are looking for.|`|c2MSP2Fwaa	To be honest it sounds like the author is trying to rationalize a feeling he can't describe almost like butterflies in your stomach much like scientists have to disprove or prove something they cant quite understand yet and while i am generally stating facts i think its a problem we as humans face all the time to answer your question alot of things are single, a scorpion in the desert it mates with something and either eats it or lets it go never to see it again was it fated to meet its mate i dont think so, a drunk girl at a party who ends up fresh meat for 30 guys i sure hope not were not much different from animals.

It's a snowstorm now, but it might get better(that's what they say on the weather channel).  Maybe, they won't have school and they're old enough to do their own things for a while.  It would give me a chance to sleep.  If they go to school, I won't get much sleep since I have to go to the bus stop with them.  It will wake me up and well...   Does that answer your question?

NhYrY4j2aa	1. I love looking for forgotten treasures, remember that someone's trash may be someone else's treasures! People in this country tend to buy too much and everything is disposable so things end up at thrft shops still with tags or barely used     2. Too many to mention, the latest: A portable/travel kennel for my dog still in the box for 20, they sell for 150 brand new!     3. Yes a Xmas gift for my mom: a matching creamer and sugar in the shape of cows.  For my dad for his birthday I got him a crate thing to keep wine bottles.     4. Plenty of times, I just found a Roxy purse for $2    5. Some do tend to charge too much (but still cheaper than buying brad new!)  I've notices that the ones that tend to overcharge a bit are the ones that keep the merchandise neater and discriminate against donations, the ones that seem to be cheaper just have everything piled on and take everything, I mean everything!|`|igI5yX0vaa	1) Clothes are overpriced at the stores.  2) Brand new blouse with Nordstrom tags still on it for less than 3$.  3) No  4) I just assume it is a counterfeit one.  5) Their prices are just right.|`|6Uohf1h1aa	1. Why do you enjoy shopping at thrift stores, rummage sales, or consignment shops? the price and variety    2. What has been the best find you've found at a thrift store? i could write a book.. lots.. i go weekly.    3. Have you ever bought someone a Christmas gift, Birthday gift, or gift in general at a thrift store? yup brand new.    4. Have you ever found any designer clothing, hand bags, or shoes at a thrift store? yup    5. Do you think thrift stores price accordingly for their items or do you feel that some thrift stores charge too much? everyone is good except goodwill|`|zhrGiQsKaa	1. i don't, it is for cheap people, i would never wear used clothes from a stranger.  2. a used dildo  3. no  4. a knock off coach purse.  5. well i am not going to pay 5 dollars for a used shirt, when i can go to Ross or Kohls and get a new shirt for less than 10 dollars.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	1. i dont. dont asume  2.i dont shop a them angry face  3. NO!!!!!  4. NO FOR THE LAST FREAKING TIME I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A STINKEN THRIFT STORE.  5. NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I IDC CARE ABOUT STUPID THRIFT STORES!!!!!!|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	Thrift stores are fun to shop in. You never know what you're going to find. It's like an adventure. My friends and I do it all the time.    I found a down coat a few months ago a the Salvation Army and it cost me 4.99. It's the warmest coat I've ever owned and it's in perfect condition.    I found hot topic clothes at thrift stores and other name brands all in good shape.|`|AA10093245	1. I enjoy shopping thrift stores because I love finding "good stuff" at cheap prices.    2.  My best find at a thrift store was my husband! I was looking for a good used microwave, and found a good used man in the bargain.    3.No, I have bought stuff for people, but if it's a gift, I buy new. It's somehow tacky in my mind to give a used gift. But giving them good stuff at non-gift times is fine.    4. Yes, I have a coach purse that i paid 8 bucks for, and a fossil purse I paid 5 bucks for, and a mossimo vest for my hubby that was 1.99 (no they aren't fakes)    5. I see prices going up, but I realize it's the economy. Those trucks use a lot of gas to go pick up that stuff.  And sometimes the pricers don't know that item can be found at a dollar store for a buck and they want 5.99 for it, but that's just a dumb pricer not a real trend.|`|Johb7jayaa	answer to 2 is coach sunglasses    answer to number 4 is i find designer clothes in thrift stores all the time|`|6bBy4gm6aa	1. they have designer stuff for a good price  2. some designer hoodies  3.no  4.yes  5.it depends on what the item is

iCqfmRC3aa	I am definitely a nudist at home.  Like you, I recognise that bare skin is natural, it is the clothes that are artificial.  Many people are taught that nudity is weird or "naughty" when in fact it is the most natural way to be.  I feel sorry for those that are taught to be ashamed of their bodies, even when they are alone.  Nudists have greater self-esteem, confidence and fewer body image problems.  My advice, be proud, be happy and by all means be Naked.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Nope.  I am always afraid someone will walk in.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Enjoy it.

2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I don`t care for either of them. The crying scene was definitely fake. She is one selfish and disrespectful brat!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I had no problem with the first and l don't with this one either.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	On today's show, I found myself feeling sorry for her a little because Abby is so mean to her and yelling at her at Noah's bedside!!  Also the other girls at school were mean and set her up to go to an event that was not happening.  I remember feeling like the odd girl out in high school.    Loved it when she went back to the hospital to see Noah!  I think she really does care about him.  Wasn't it great when Michael and Lauren dragged her out of the hospital in her disguise in scrubs??  They really have their hands full with her.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I like this Eden, and I liked the first Eden, too.    TX Mom|`|FwU6GL4Laa	This Eden is prettier than the last one but neither can act..I think the storyline is boring and going nowhere|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	On every soap board I have been on people are saying the character and actor are bad. She doesn't interest me so I really haven't paid attention|`|IxoazyHUaa	I didn't care for the first Eden, but this one is even worse!  Are there no teenage girls in Hollywood who can act??|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I agree the first Eden was bad and this one is no better.  Her over the top facial expressions are too much.  I know what you mean by that crying scene, she was terrible.  I think she is inexperienced and really hope she goes to acting lessons if she wants to make this her career   I do not like the character of Eden and would not shed a tear if they wrote her out.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	I thought the first Eden was just fine and the same goes for this one.  If people would just have a little bit of patience and give her sometime to find her way and get more comfortable with the character, she just might surprise everyone and turn out to be a really great actress after all.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	haahaha! that's funny cause I laughed! It was supposed to be a sad touching moment but instead it was hilarious!|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	i don't like either; we went from goth to prep, and neither fit in the soap......i suppose the storyline is realistic, how sharon is raggin on her son seeing this bad influence (can we say flashback to nikki saying the same to nck about sharon-- hell the witch got preggers adn gave the kid up!! got her man wrongly put in prison for raping her friends!) is the next generation dejavu starting now?? tell your son to stay away is just going to push him faster-- as I recall, he was the one ready for some 'body-warming activites' at the lake, it was eden who had some sense..... but hopefully this will pass too|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	This show cannot cast the role of Eden to save their lives. The first one was awful and the second one is even more awful. This one is so annoying and arrogant. Her acting is awful. What is going on with the casting people on this show.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	lol>>> agree 100 % ,,, I thought I was going to like this one but maybe  her new role went to her head ??? She has done nothing but b1tch & complain and get Noah into trouble since she walked into Genoa City ! I don't see how Michael & Lauren can believe a word that comes out of that squeaky-winey-mouth of hers ? I wish River would return to town and take her back ,, before Poor Noah ends uP with a rap sheet.|`|75zggy81aa	I agree! Both are horrible actresses and the character of Eden is just annoying, i wish they could cast a cute girl as a new character with some personality for Noah. Eden SUCKS!!!|`|30r4coInaa	I like her.  She's new, give her time!  We ALL hated Sabrina at first and now 1/2 the viewers are still upset about her death/firing.|`|oLFCs2mVaa	I like this one better than the first one.However, It sounds like they have the exact same voice to me. this one is much cuter than the first one. I think she will work out just fine. Just give her time.|`|d9c0f5c5286294dcbb5ab28de65e8c39aa	Omg this eden suuuucks. I think the first one would have done a better job. This one can't even cry she sounds let a wounded animal|`|uR4yfY3Vaa	I laughed 2 @ the sooo fake crying scene lol she is horrible @ trying 2 cry but I like her better than the first Eden though...maybe if we give her a little more time she will end up doing great...lets hope huh?
q4XUy0Duaa	LMAO @ hippity hop<br>  What's church music?<br>  There aint nothin' wrong wit' a little bump & grind.<br>  GTA has great music, and actually helps children expand their music interests into different genres.<br>  Yes, Larry = douche bag<br>  Who the hell is Larry anyway?<br>  <br>  EDIT: So this is just some dude on Y!A?  If he thinks children wouldn't be exposed to rap without playing San Andreas (I'm not sure why he chose this game out of the whole GTA series), then he's stupid.  They can turn on the TV or radio and hear "gangsta rap" just as easily.  I'm tired of people blaming rap for their poor parenting.  No one gives a sh*t about characters dropping anvils on each other in Looney Tunes.  The biggest influence anyone has over the children is their parents.  Kids will pick up bad habits, or have serious issues or disorders from their upbringing more than they will from playing a game.|`|pwXcD7PIaa	Larry I found a lil somethin for you<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9quvn3vajug" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9quvn3vaj...</a>

You download it and search for, lets say, "naruto shippuuden 94" and they give you a whole list of videos, music, and photos.  You click download and on the bottom part of the screen it will continue to download and you can check back later to see the progress. ***NOTE*** everything in limewire if free!

claUGpVRaa	I think she has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard and she is incredibly pretty - a very lucky girl.<br>  She will go a long way and I think she will keep herself grounded too|`|DphUE9tbaa	She is an appallingly bad singer, but, to be fair, it is not entirely her fault.  She may actually have the ability to sing well, but she sings in the way that judges on the x-factor approve of - the Whitney/Maria school of screeching.<br>  <br>  What's wrong with her singing?  Simple - she never hits a note true.  Instead she sings a series of notes around the true note.  She also uses irritating amounts of vibrato (warbling, basically) and heavy breathing in an attempt to fake emotion.  Her voice is in fact all technique and no emotion.  It's an ugly sound and you're unlikely to find many people over about 35 years old who can listen to it at all.  I have to turn the radio off or leave the room as it has the same effect on me as a dentist's drill or fingernails down a blackboard.|`|mAjyNjV5aa	She is manufactured as designer trainers at some back end of an Indian factory.

Metallica have more good albums than slipknot have good songs.    I mean slipknot have some great songs, but the rest are absolute ****.

Ok Lets look at it  METALLICA:  1- Metallica has made 9 albums all went Platinum.  2- metallica are here since 1981  3- An Icon for Heavy Metal  4- Huge influence on music  5- Not just for show, its all about the music   6- their first albums are timeless. the album kill em all have been there since 1983 i believe and still people are listening to it.     SlipKnot:  1- 4 albums  2- here since 1995  3- all albums went Platinum except All hope is gone which went Gold  4- they have somewhat of a 'show' like the masks is for show, they are just putting on a show, if they were as good of a band as metallica they would have been known for their music more than their masks and style  5- didnt have much of an influence on music.      clearly Metallica is way better in my opinion and its more obvious they have done so much more to the music than slipKnot.    Dont get me wrong I love both  but I have something called common sense. which most of the people here dont have.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	I think you've got it backwards.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	look dude you are an idiot.

Over all slipknot always has and always will sound better thatn metallica|`|KqypHx4Eaa	I like both  but i'll go with slipknot.  metallica sound good no more.|`|H77uh3QBaa	that is majorly hard......but i would hav to say metallica. i still luv luv luv slipknot tho!|`|KOH5kPuLaa	they are two totally different bands its hard to compare slipknot is my favorite, but metallica has its hits also (mostly the old ones)     i would have to say slipknot is better NOW than metallica but in the late 80's metallica rocked|`|akLyUaUeaa	Metallica, Slipknot is annoying!!!  :P|`|gLHCAcEDaa	slipknot|`|HrO3jOoYaa	Dude Slipknot is so much better.

Get my DRIFT.|`|aRRQrwd9aa	The older slipknot songs!!!! newer slipknot music isn't as good as it use to be-|`|R11zYU4daa	you have to give metallica respect, metallice is a more older band and has more experience with music and can dance circles around slipknot if they wanted to. you have to learn the true value of music and learn to repsect them.

h1IYS0dbaa	First of all, both movies are great!<br>  <br>  Comparing "The Dark Knight" with "Slumdog Millionaire" is however like comparing apples with polar bears. How can you compare a brilliantly made movie about a comic figure with a wonderful film about life and love in India?<br>  <br>  But don't worry... The Dark Knight will get at least 3 Oscars.<br>  <br>  The winner will be "The Curious Case Of Benajamin Button". You'll see... (that's a prediction and not a pick by the way)|`|rvBZPIv4aa	I haven't seen Slumdog...but I thought Dark Knight was boring.

That's like comparing a comic book with a Shakespeare play.|`|SuqQJJMLaa	slumdog deserves its nomination and so does the dark knight but not in its place,maybe it just missed the cut

If you posted TWICE and it was reported BOTH times, then yes......you lose the points twice.  I don't know HOW you could be reported TWICE for the SAME single question, as two "reports" equals a violation and then your question is removed.    Couls have just been a glitch. <br>  <br>  and I must defend the Yahoo staff.!   While I have taken my LUMPS as well, I find that they respond to all.......quickly......and most often, FAIRLY. <br>  <br>  If you are flagrantly breaking the rules.........then, no doubt you have problems with the yahoo staff.   But I find them to be VERY FAIR......and I have had countless appeals WON and overturned.....since I get reported by trolls who merely DISAGREE with me on politics.  (Disagreeing is NOT a reportable offense!) <br>  <br>  it only hurts the trolls, when those sorts of reports are overturned.|`|GO0FqfOIaa	grr. lol.<br>  Yesterday they were like : yahoo is currently unavailable.

rHrr7zmVaa	I was just thinking the same thing, he sounded amazing on performance night and yet Simon "douche" commented on his 'lack of charismatic appeal' , and what about David Archuleta last year? He certainly has Zero Charisma, how come Simon never said anything about him? And Michael S. made it to top 12 is laughable, his performance was horrible, I would rather have Ricky, Brent, Anoop or even Tatiana made it to top 12, they were miles better than him. And Danny is hugely overrated, very very overrated, the show revolves around him now and the idea of showing his dead wife on air every time is a plot to get all the sympathy votes. Danny isn't even that good, Alexis and Ricky were miles better than him vocally speaking, Danny however made a smart move by picking songs that are very well known to appeal to a lot of viewers.... <br>  <br>  Anyway, Hoping for Anoop or Ricky as Wildcard.

Yeter Yildirim, a 15 year old Turkish girl, had suffered from stomach pains for over five years. They were a constant torment to the girl. She had gone from a happy girl with lots of friends to a lonesome girl who suffered sever head aches and stomach pain. Her family was shunned by suspicious villagers in their little farming community. Eventually Yeter's family moved 80 miles away because they were being persecuted by the town. As her symptoms worsened, her family finally took her to a hospital.    The doctors x-rayed her and went to talk to her parents. They matter-of-factly stated that there would be no problem removing the snakes from the young girls stomach. "What snakes??" asked her shocked parents.    The x-rays showed three snakes living in the girl's stomach, water snakes that she had apparently swallowed as eggs while drinking from a stream. They hatched and lived there for 5 years before being discovered as the cause of her sickness. They were slightly thicker than string and about a foot long. She was fine after they were removed.|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	Why don't you look it up yourself? Google is useful for more than just photos. I mean, why waste the five points to ask a question that could easily be solved by you in a matter of minutes? Plus, I doubt a whole lot of people are going to take the time to write out a long story that you could use for this co-ed camp out.    But.. I'm not going to waste my answer suggesting something that you're not going to do. Here's a fricken' story for ya:    A young girl, around the age of sixteen, was babysitting two young children for her neighbor, who had gone out to dinner with a few close coworkers. It was around eight o' clock when she went to go put the children to sleep. "If you need me, I'll be downstairs." She told them, knowing that these children always had a hard time going to sleep.  Fifteen minutes later, the children came downstairs and whined loudly. "We miss mommy, can we sleep in her bed?" They asked, and the babysitter saw no harm in it, so she tucked them into their mother's bed and started for the door. "Wait, can you cover the clown statue in the corner?" They asked, a bit frightened, and the babysitter did.   An hour later, the kid's parents called, checking in. "They missed you and asked if they could sleep in your bed, so I tucked them in. But.. they didn't like the clown statue in the corner, so I covered it, I hope that's alright." The babysitter said and there was a short pause from the other end. "Honey.. we don't have a clown statue in our room." The mother said in a very worried tone.   The babysitter hung up the phone quickly before hearing a shrill scream and a loud slam from above her. When she ran back upstairs, she found the two children, dead and the window open with a small red clown nose on the window sill.    Another quick one:    A young girl was walking home one day from school and as she was walking, she heard footsteps behind her. Looking back, she saw a tall man walking a black labrador. Seeing the dog reminded her of her own golden retreiver, Maggie. When she returned home, she ate, did her homework, watched television and went to sleep. Every night before she let sleep take her, she would call Maggie into her room and the dog would scurry under her bed and the girl would let Maggie lick her hand until she fell asleep.   The next day, she saw the tall man again with the black labrador when walking home from school. The man tried to speak to her, but the girl ran off. That night, she went to sleep and let Maggie lick her hand.   The next morning, when the girl went to the bathroom, there was Maggie, strung up and hanging.. bloody and torn from the steel curtain rod. There was a note nearby that read, "People can lick too."|`|llQwjX5Raa	Um............ This is real but not that scary There was this family. They were being normal maybe at 2-3 in the morning. They had their bathroom door closed upstairs no one was upstairs they were all downstairs like watching TV. Well then their door creaks open upstairs (the bathroom door that was closed). Then the next night they have these spirit searchers come to their house. And they say this spirit was the owner of the house they live in. So this spirit haunts the house every night.

dvUS0HHXaa	If you want an Orange get an Orange Tiny Terror head and cab, as combos tend not to sound so good live.<br>  <br>  If you realise that Orange amps aren't really fitting to your style for good all-round amps try the following:<br>  <br>  Marshall<br>  Peavey<br>  Line 6 (if you want a versatile modelling amp)<br>  Vox (may be a bit pricey)<br>  <br>  Try out different models and see which ones suit you.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Well, sounds like an Orange amp would be your best bet then! These are usually bass amps, so if you're a guitarist I'd recommend something different like a Peavy or a Marshall. If you're starting to play live, most places should have a PA, meaning your amp doesn't have to be too loud, it just has to achieve the sound and tone you want, so a 50 watt should be fine.|`|6sSZPxtHaa	Kind of depends what kind of music you play... I've had a lot of amps. Laney, Marshall, Rivera, Fender twin. I think the best overall is Line 6 flextone. It's a good value and offers the best range of decent sounds. It's solid state but it still sounds good. The best thing about it is that is durable and will not have any maintenance costs associated with tube amps. IE spring reverb always breaking, tubes going bad, capacitors and resister blowing. All that stuff gets really old fast. Plus|`|f279e76fb473e663c0561d5e2597318baa	any Marshall JCM half-stack is an excellent choice.

2R1H8B8taa	I think Izzy may be dying too.    I think it's always bad when a show brings back a dead character to speak to the alive people. Yep, I think I'm done with greys. i think they have had all the combinations of people sleep together by now. ARgh!|`|hTr1dpTiaa	SO sick of Denny, they just need to let Izzy be happy with Alex and continue the Sloan/Little Grey, and turn it back into the show it used to be.|`|45ab0bea68cbc724ceec9b426a6147b3aa	Lost me when they started letting her have sex with the dead man.

ax9xk0Ndaa	Scorpio Sun..Cancer Moon..Leo Rising<br>  That's a nice mix by the way lol and i'm being serious<br>  <br>  Anyways.. In my opinion having a Scorpio Sun along with a Cancer Moon will make you very secretive about things deep and personal to you..but really sensitive..it's all about emotions to you..you don't like people taking the mick or being insultive cos you take things people say quite personally whether you show it or not..<br>  <br>  I bet you're really sweet..whether you show that or not..and the two water signs in the sun & moon makes me think you're probably really funny..And even if you don't think so people find you funny..<br>  <br>  Errm what else now......You're really good at picking up people's feelings and are really aware of those around you..<br>  It also tells me that you know how to hurt someone's feelings and you could be really mean if you wanted to..cos you just know how it would affect someone..but cos of your cancer moon you might hold back on that cos you don't want to hurt noones feelings..<br>  <br>  Having a Scorpio Sun says you like to Party (based on those i know) but having a cancer moon (based on those i know and what i know) you love your alone time..at home..<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and you're moody lol<br>  <br>  really moody when you're ready<br>  <br>  ..but yeah man nice mix nice mix|`|VCF9os1jaa	Wow, that is the same as my boyfriend. Even the Leo rising. And the one above me, hit it pretty much on the head. Wow lol. Your a slight show off, and love to be noticed. Probably worry about your hair alot. Like tighter clothes, and shows it off. But when it comes to showing the real you, you hide it deep. You are very moody, and want your alone time. Whoever is with you, will wonder where they actually stand with you. You can be very frustrating, and make it look like it is the other persons problem. Your pretty easy going, not allowing a lot of things to get to you, at least on the surface. Your good with words, and can make others think it is their choice, when it is you guiding them. Your good with kids.

Z9itluhvaa	Ooh, I hope so.  I think she's awesome - and she and Joseph are so into each other!  Let's not forget Faye is at least a compulsive liar, at worst a big murderer, I love the scenes where she shows her true colours arguing with Jac.    http://www.holby.tv/news/Spoilers.shtml is my favourite site for spoilers (geeky!), I agree with Emily M in that it's a brilliant storyline twist - the one thing Joseph wants more than anything is something Faye can't give him, but Jac can ;)|`|9kTejB0uaa	In real life?  Nah, she's the original stick insect.  On the show - I have a feeling she may turn out to be, as the result of the one-night-stand with what's is name.    ps.  Holby is really boring me at the moment.  In fact I slept through most of it this week ................   And Cas. isn't much better - where have all the good/interesting characters gone?|`|9obbcWH2aa	im not quite sure if she is but in a couple of weeks apparantly faye is gonna start to think that faye maybe pregnant but i dnt no if she is....but i want faye and linden to get together!!!!|`|QJB7sgOgaa	I hope so!!! I think she's an excellant character, what do you think Jo would do? do you think it'd make Faye change her mind in order to keep her man the possibilities are endless!!!  Great twist a big well done to the writers!!!|`|WUEJdKNmaa	no she is just pretending to wind Joseph up and make him think that she is.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I had not noticed, I will keep an eye on her|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I want to know that too!! it'd be such a typical story if she was though...and it would break Fayes heart if she was! and honestly, Faye has has enough heartbreak and deserves some happiness!    And honestly, Jac is so nasty she doesn't deserve a child!  She's too selfish anyway.  I reckon if she is pregnant she'll have an abortion and Joseph will be devestated...bad situation which would serve him right for cheating!    I'm so glad this is only a tv show we're talking about, i'm not this nasty and unforgiving in real life! lol!

NQFV2AdZaa	The custody of her two kids will be shared between the natural father, Jeff, Jade's mum and Jack, so what's your problem? I doubt Jack will harm the boys in any way and i'm sure that they will be well looked after.|`|723QHuicaa	For goodness sake - the woman is dying and marrying him is what she want and is making her happy.<br>  <br>  So he has a jaded past - she knows about it and still wants to marry him.<br>  <br>  And no - this man will NOT have custody of her children - their real father will.<br>  <br>  Maybe her family can give her kids all the support they need - but what harm is there for 1 extra person looking out for them.|`|3qLIRorjaa	The children will be going to their real dad, Jeff, not him.<br>  <br>  Personally i think she's mad to marry him. He's clearly only in it for himself.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	EEErrrrrr you don't know the Jade family background then ?   Better brush up cos she was from a very abusive background with a one armed lesbian mother (no joke) and a father that treated her dreadfully not to mention the other stuff.  This is someone you would not want to trade places with.  Do you know the background to the "taken a golf club to a teenager" story ?  I think not.  Go back to yr sofa and Jeremy Kyle.  Get some background info before you ask Q's otherwise you look more stupid than Jade hun but she's savvy enough to realis and admit hers and make money out of it  !!!|`|zD2NWrIzaa	the woman is dieing in front of your eyes, leave her alone she is doing what she wants to do, so get on with your own life|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	So she is marrying a cowardly putz (who's in jail) whats new?  More commission for Max Clifford.|`|PliIXKdIaa	Everyone deserves a second chance but he is practically a teenager himself! he is only 21. And kids, teenagers and even adult these days do far worse like shooting, stabbing etc?!! at least he is alive and i'm not sticking up for jack because what he done was so wrong but people these days do far worse!!!<br>  <br>  As for the kids.... Jeff is going to have custody obv jack will still see them and be with them while they are growing up but you seem to be forgetting the boys do have a dad!<br>  <br>  And as for the people taking the p*ss out of her or doing interviews and still being in the public eye, i say good on her! she is trying to get as much money as possible to give her boys the best money can buy. she won't be there to financially support them so she is trying her best now. <br>  <br>  I think its horrible at such a young age something like this has happened it's so sad but i hope her wedding goes well she deserves to be happy. after reading her book she had such a horrible upbringing and she doesn't want the same for her kids so i think she is doing what's best.|`|q4tTabfjaa	He will do his time, the family will be kept in the radar of the authorities, thing is, this is not why she is getting married, it is for her and it is her choice.  Will he always want to have custody of the children?  Will he give it up to the grandparents eventually?  In the meantime, it is her choice to marry him, not yours.  This could be the making of the man.  Oh and someone just said that the children will go to their own dad.  End of story.  Mind yer own now and let your self rest in peace.|`|60aZG9E7aa	if she wants to get married that is up to her. I love jade. My sister has cancer if she wanted to get married i would support her 100%. I did not like jade at the start but now i love her. Does anyone know what it is like to have cancer in your family? Let her live the last few months of her life to the max as she willl not get another chance.|`|AA10944402	the fact that this woman Goody is getting so much publicity is pathetic. she is talentless,ugly and whoever is marrying her must be not only deaf and blind but desperate.|`|7uJaCXMHaa	Its sad, in regards to her childen she made a choice and it should be respected|`|eiSaaLxUaa	He won't have custody, their father Jeff Brazier will.|`|52pZj3WFaa	Yes, you would think so wouldn't you.<br>  <br>  But lets face it.

[probly not but who knows]|`|qIgzwUp9aa	i agree with the first answer, you cant trust us to decide that sort of thing, we've never heard you sing!<br>  but what i think you should try is to do excercises every day in the middle to low register of your voice, and you'll get them.<br>  but dont drop out!!
Bi51WJd7aa	I am sorry to say this but I have NEVER understood how Claudia Schiffer ever became a model (even though I know most models are not models merely based on their looks), because I think she is extremely unattractive - it's actually mind-boggling lol!<br>  <br>  So, Heidi definitely.

While the third season is a bit less eventful, the fourth season is by far the most incredible television I've seen in a while. I really hope you enjoy the series!    PS try BJ's.

7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	Well it is a technique just like anything else to do with drumming. I practice by playing 16th notes starting really....reeeally slow and then building up over a period of about 15 minutes to a moderate tempo...staying there for a few minutes adn then try to build up to as fast as possible. You do this every day for a few weeks and you will  see the difference in no time. Velocity is a key factor when it comes to double bass drumming and also getting both feet playing at the SAME velocity. If you have been playing using your right foot only on kick then it is bound to be stronger than your left. It takes some time to get the left accustomed to playing with the same force as you lead foot.       Remember though.....playing double bass drums is not ALL about playing as fast as possible. Drumming should be all about musicality and playing what suits the song not just showing off how fast you can play. Chops are WAY more impressive than speed.    *edit..."heel up" is the only really effective way to play double bass drums

xay8jhEqaa	SM are touring US this year for their american auditions, this is not confirmed but its almost definite.<br>  <br>  if they accept you then yes you have to sing in person because they cant just accept a person who they dont even see! and if they really and truly accept you they will pay for your plane ticket but only if they truly want to see you... i dont want you to feel bad but remember that email audiitons have less chance of being accepted then auditioning in person... if you really cant go audition in person then something thats BETTER than sending an email is sending a CD by mail, because they prefer that because they get to hear more than one song from you and its clear quality and also remember to add a video of you dancing on the CD, NOT compulsory but soooo reccomended by them.<br>  <br>  remember it is REALLY hard to enter SM, and even then it's HARD , much harder training than YG or  JYP, so good luck! ^^ and you go through about 3 stages to truly get through into SM - the last stage you sing in front of SM himself.<br>  <br>  hope that helps

uxVIlXlvaa	are you talking about the high e or the low e? if its the high e, it means its lined up perfectly as a octave of the low one, which is how its supposed to be. you just need to learn how to control it better.<br>  <br>  if that is not the case, have you thought of changing strings? strings need to be changed every 1-3 months depending on how much you play. also when you put the stings on, remember to stretch them out, otherwise things like this can happen. did you inspect by playing it unplugged?

pplwf1Luaa	A photo that appears to be Rihanna's face with bruises, scratches and swelling from an attack allegedly at the hands of boyfriend Chris Brown was posted Thursday night by the celebrity Web site TMZ.<br>  <br>  The close-up image shows a welt above each of the woman's eyebrows, marks on her cheek and around her lips, and general swelling. TMZ did not say how it obtained the photo, when it was taken or by whom.<br>  <br>  Hours after the photo was posted, the Los Angeles Police Department launched an internal investigation and asked for the public's help in finding the person who leaked it. A police news release said the image "has the appearance" of one taken during a domestic violence investigation, and classified its release as a case of serious misconduct that could result in termination.<br>  <br>  Asked earlier Thursday whether he could confirm the photo's origin, LAPD Officer Jason Lee said only that the department had not released images of the woman who accused Brown, and would not release evidence photos. A spokeswoman for the district attorney said all evidence related to the case was still with police.<br>  Brown was arrested Feb. 8 and booked on suspicion of making felony criminal threats to a woman that authorities have not publicly identified. A person familiar with the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity, confirmed that the woman was Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty.<br>  <br>  The person said some of the injuries shown in the photo — specifically the marks on the woman's forehead — were consistent with the injuries Rihanna sustained.<br>  <br>  Prosecutors have asked police to provide more information before deciding what charges, if any, to pursue against Brown. Police have said the 19-year-old singer could face domestic violence charges if prosecutors think they are appropriate.<br>  <br>  An Associated Press photo of Rihanna, taken before the party on the night of the incident, shows her with a tattoo of Roman numerals on her left shoulder; the TMZ photo shows the same numerals on the same shoulder. TMZ had previously used its site to debunk a manipulated image that depicted Rihanna with a black eye.<br>  <br>  No public statement has been issued on behalf of Rihanna, who turns 21 on Friday. Email and telephone messages left late Thursday with representatives for both Brown and Rihanna were not immediately returned.<br>  <br>  Brown released a statement on Sunday, which read in part, "Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired." The statement, which did not mention Rihanna, said Brown was consulting with loved ones, his mother and pastor.<br>  <br>  Brown's arrest came roughly 18 hours after he and Rihanna left a pre-Grammy party honoring music mogul Clive Davis. According to police, Brown and a woman were involved in an altercation in a car traveling through the upscale Hancock Park neighborhood shortly after midnight. Police have said the woman had visible injuries, and that Brown was gone from the scene when they arrived.|`|sMEni2Tdaa	<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29295842/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29295842/</a><br>  Eh...<br>  I feel bad for her....|`|BMkVOR0caa	Nobody knows the full truth.

Plus if she new she had it she should have told him before they had sex and now she has mest him up and she is wrong for that. And if she cheated with Jay Z she is no good for that and if Jay Z gave it to her he gave it to beyonce.

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Earthling (1980)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Patrick Foley (William Holden) has been on the move all his live. Tired of drifting, he wants to spend his last days in an isolated Australian valley where he grew up. On his difficult journey he meets Shawn (Ricky Schroder), a desperate city-boy whose parents were killed in an accident in this remote inhospitable territory. Being unable to accompany the boy back to the civilized world, he reluctantly takes him with him on his trip to that valley and teaches him in a rugged way how to survive.<br>  IMDb review excerpt:<br>  Foley will be dying shortly and is on his way to the Outback to pass over~trying to get away, not take baggage on his final trip. Yet, he runs into Shawn, who is the only survivor of a crash of his family's motorhome. // The father accidentally puts the vehicle in reverse, if I recall, sending in a backward slide off the edge of a bluff despite attempts to correct the maneuver. The boy's mother also is in the vehicle, but the boy has not boarded it yet. My memory is a bit hazy, but I do recall that the motorhome falls a great distance, with obviously no chance of survival by the couple.

UX2dqQQVaa	I agree completely.  I love Biggie and I think 2pac was pretty hard too...BUT...Biggie had a better flow and better content/lyrics/and style.  2pac just had this swagger that people confused with talent.  2pac had a good style but not that great with his lyrics....him and Eazy-E fall into the same category.  <br>  <br>  I also agree with your Westside Connection comment as well.  The Westside Connection CD "Bow Down" is one of my favorite CDs ever.  That whole CD is hard...every song...that is a West Coast classic.  As far as lyrics, the East Coast in the 90s had it.  The West Coast was hard and it has some straight bangers.|`|haxPqmIgaa	Same exact opinion with me. I h8 how every1 says pac is way betta.

His lyrics really touched life and tough topics while Biggie made more playa songs. And Pac was fearless. He had a certain style to all of the songs he rapped on. And just because Pac didn't wan't to end the beef doesn't make him any less of a rapper. I'd rag-tag all over someone too if I thought they shot me.
qswrz268aa	They each have their own difficulty... It depends on your strong points...<br>  <br>  Number 1: REALLY hard, often times considered the hardest there is, It has large, fast, and broad arpeggios. Not recommended.<br>  <br>  Number 2: VERY hard, it takes some serious muscle in the 3rd 4th and 5th fingers. Unless you've got incredible dexterity, this one should be avoided.<br>  <br>  Number 3: MODERATELY hard, it requires some mean voicing, and great musicality to make it beautiful, if you're musical, this is the one to go with. <br>  <br>  Number 4: EXTREMELY hard, this one is in my opinion the hardest of all of them, it requires lots of voicing to voice the moving melody from hand to hand, very proficient technique, and a good interpretative power on Chopin. Not recommended for the first one.<br>  <br>  Number 5: MODERATELY hard, this one takes quite a bit of relaxation, speed, and technique, but it's not to hard. I recommend it if technique is your strong suit over musicality.<br>  <br>  Number 6: REALLY hard, this one requires an insane amount of musicality, as it can sound terrible without the right amount of voicing, phrasing, and passion. It has crazy harmonies and chromatics, and takes 'magic' to make it sound good. Besides this it is extraordinarily easy, not requiring any special technique. If your musicality is your strong suit, I recommend this one.<br>  <br>  Number 7: EXTREMELY hard, this one takes a ton of speed and strength to execute the rapid repeated chords. In addition, it is very awkward to learn because of its lack of melodic melody, and strange harmonies. Not recommended at all. <br>  <br>  Number 8: VERY hard, this one requires you to play rapid and strange arpeggios, its really quite a challenge to learn the notes as well. Not recommended unless you have a very good arpeggio technique. <br>  <br>  Number 9: FAIRLY hard, this one isn't to bad. The left hand arpeggios exhaust your 5th and 4th fingers, but that is about all the challenge. It doesn't require too much musicality, nor technique. However, it is usually an unpopular etude. I recommend this one with reservations, however, just make sure you have a good "operatic" passion as you play it. <br>  <br>  Number 10: DESPERATELY hard, okay, I take that back, number 4 isn't the hardest, this one is. It is very awkward to play, and it takes a lot of musicality to produce a good sound, and not a mush. It also requires exhausting technique to execute the sixths, and the jumps. Not at all recommended.<br>  <br>  Number 11: DECEIVINGLY hard, when your first look at this score, you'll think "That's a lot of squiggly lines!" That's all this etude is, large arpeggiated chords. I think its very difficult, but you might be a master at arpegiated chords. Other than the arpegiated chords, its easy.<br>  <br>  Number 12: MODERATELY hard, this one has very fast, but rather easy arpeggios. The first couple of measures are the hardest, but after that, the arpeggios in the left hand are rather redundant, and besides the arpeggios, this one isn't to tough. I recommend it, unless you have trouble with left hand arpeggios. <br>  <br>  Good luck with all of them!!! I hope I gave you a good idea of the ones you should start out with! Have a great day!!! :]|`|AA12376180	I do not think any of them as easy. For me number 3 came fairly quickly and number 2 although I still do not play it a fast as I would like too. No. 6 also should be considered.

3WItFAwlaa	The only cusps are house cusps in your natal chart.  There are no sign cusps.  The Sun cannot be in two places at one time.  You will soon learn that many people (even Top Contributors) here know little to nothing about real astrology.  The whole chart needs to be considered.  There is something else in their chart that accounts for the traits of the other sign.  Or maybe they just don't know themselves very well and just think they have those traits.  There are many explainations.  But nobody has two Sun signs.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	You are either one sign or the other.The cusp is the last few degrees of one sign and the first few degrees of the next.I've studied lots of charts of people born near a cusp,I also know several people born near a cusp and none display the traits of both signs,including myself.We have many facets to our characters and these are reasons we behave in different ways under different circumstances.Astrology is a complex subject and takes many years to learn,and although a lot of the answerers on this site are trying to be helpful they're really not informed enough to give accurate answers.I'm not disrespecting anybody,I'm just stating a fact.Hope this helps you.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Those who draw their first breath when one sign is giving place to another are said to belong on the Cusp, and so par-take of the characteristics of both signs. This may be an advantage or a disad-vantage, according to the harmony or in harmony of the signs. Six days in a sign is said to constitute a residence, but anything less than this time endows one with some of the qualities of the preceding sign.<br>  <br>  Some qualities doesn't mean that you have not all the qualities of your own sign but that you have some of the precedent.

HSSuKNCUaa	I think we can't forget that...<br>  1) people aren't just their sunsign<br>  2) past experiences have influence, too, even on Aries<br>  3) age and maturity play a role as well<br>  4) the extend to which you understand Aries has an influence, too<br>  <br>  I'm Venus Aries and I'm supposed to be an assertive hit-and-runner, too. But I'm not. I think it might be my Pisces Moon that makes me more romantic, and my Taurus Sun calming me down.<br>  <br>  The same goes for my boyfriend, who is in fact an Aries male. But he's older than me (I'm 22, he's 35) and yes he's done his chasing in the past but was lately looking for something serious and long-lasting. Aries can have experiences that make him tired of the game. And love can stop everyone in their tracks; I may not have been a hit-and-run, but I certainly wasn't the mushy type, in fact I didn't believe in love until I met my Aries, I was a sceptic. In the end, the amount of affection a person feels is the biggest influence on their behaviour.<br>  <br>  Then there's him also having a water moon, which makes him more sensitive. And then there's the part where, well yeah, you have to "play the game" sometimes. It keeps everything alive. There are plenty, and I do mean PLENTY, of Aries who have been happily married for a long period of time. There is no reason to assume Aries will always be an untamable cheat.<br>  <br>  My tendency towards emotional and physical independence keeps him interested, keeps him coming back, and I guess that's what I need, too. I need him to come to me, because I can't stand having to chase after him all the time wondering how he feels. It works for both of us that I sometimes let him chase me. It keeps him excited and it keeps me confident that he wants me. <br>  <br>  Most of all; the best way to guarentee an Aries will cheat on you or lie to you, is by letting it show that you EXPECT them to. To Aries, a lack of trust in them doesn't only hurt their egoes, it is also a free ticket to them to do as they please since you don't trust them anyway. As long as they feel like they can keep you looking up to them, keep you thinking they are fantastic, they will do everything to BE fantastic including staying faithful and honest.|`|oDdXpghDaa	OMG, I totally agree with the statement here.  I've had a MAJOR crush on 2 Aries males only to be totally hurt.  They were both the same.  Major flirts and teases that make you think they're into you when they've got like 3 others on the side.  They're all about the chase, and once they've caught you they kick you to the curb like last week's garbage.  Both lost interest within weeks of FINALLY "deciding what they wanted."<br>  <br>  Both Aries boys were quiet, shy, and reserved - but it's all a cover because they're the biggest man-whores on the Earth.  They're also really really book smart, but not very street smart (at least in my experience).  <br>  <br>  So, in short, expect to get played and heart broken by a cheap, uncaring, dumb ram.|`|E855dvZdaa	Aries chases after adventure. They like change, they dont wallow in there own pity and moves on rather fast after a bad relationship. They live for the moment and are easily bored and sometimes create there own drama for the fun of it.<br>  <br>  This is true for male and female.|`|XJTynEaMaa	You can get perfect information about Aries Male from the link below|`|QZzQdh43aa	they tend to be headstrong and impulsive, that's why|`|p0NnFB7Daa	everything|`|ixHwF4apaa	i am aries, so i will tell we are greatest. what else you expect

They all need a safety course in driving period in PV!|`|zFb022Iiaa	Ya I think it was less ironic and more stale.  So Ryan is saying she's dead instead of missing.  Did they find a body?|`|d2RV8HTmaa	Yeah, and are there really cliffs like that in Pennsylvania where you just disappear off into the unknown?<br>  <br>  I don't know if the writers' planned the storylines this way, but you would think the writers' could come up with something a little more creative.|`|XnYkROf3aa	yeah i thought that to. but when greenlee comes back ( and she will come back i just know it) ryan wont have a thing to say.|`|nndflDc9aa	Very Ironic& stupid lol.|`|AA11791082	I think we all knew that Ryan and Greenlee liked living on the edge, but I still want to know why a recent heart transplant patient who had just come out of a 4 month long coma was driving a car on a dark night. I thought you weren't allowed to drive a car after a major operation, let alone after waking up from a coma.  Plus, with all Kendall's screaming and hollering over truth and honesty and how she hates hates hates everyone who lies to her, why is she then lying to the world and letting Zach be the fall guy for her crime? How very convenient for her.<br>  <br>  Yes though, this is partial payback for Ryan, after all of his fraudulent behavior back when Greenlee and Kendall were playing pregnancy games. I'm starting to think that nobody on that show should be allowed a motorcycle license ever again. The writers need to come up with a new way for people to disappear, because this motorcycle thing has run its course.|`|AA11451041	LOL obviously both of them should be taking the heel toe express instead of riding a motorcycle.
AqXadhUzaa	Well, we don't know if that is Rihanna. I hope its not because its upsetting to see. <br>  <br>  Chris Brown is sick for doing it if he did and he should just go away now. Make no more statements. Nothing. Just go away. No one wants to see or hear from him...|`|FmhUZLgoaa	You don't do that to a girl. He should have his a@# kicked to see what it's like!|`|AA11615501	Where I am from you dont man-handle women.

6YnP3S0Uaa	The moral of the story is, you should never hit a girl...unless she has a gun pointed at your head or something.  I don't care what she did, but he should have never laid a finger on her.  If she was hitting him, all he had to do was hold her off until someone else came.  It had something to do with ego, however, I don't think it was jealousy.|`|q8MVZtmEaa	There's videos on YouTube about how they think Rihanna thought he was cheating by looking through his phone.

Let yo mom or sister get an a** kickin & lets see if u would accept the reasons yall use to justify this... <br>  <br>  Herpes story being true,, doesnt excuse this!<br>  <br>  Any guy that has sex wit a women is equally to blame if they catach a STD.  If the condom breaks.. get mad at Trojan.. if u go bare back.. thats yo fault.  There is no excuse fo whoppin a females *** for a male (unless it is life of death and she has a gun)<br>  <br>  To your question.  Naw i dont think so.  I think C. Brown was influenced by livin in a home that had domestic violence<br>  <br>  <br>  @ Non-Scholor above - Exactly... u a Hypocrite.  It is different when it is your family.. but those same rules don't apply to all?  Pick up a book jack a--.  Things are not only right or wrong based on how they affect you.

For all we know she could've got pushed and hit her head on the car.  I know you females wanna stick together, but  I'll wait for the full story with all the details<br>  <br>  the whole point im trying to make is if she indeed put her hands on him, than  none of this would've happened if she didnt.  Isnt that what you learn as a kid? keep your hands to yourself<br>  <br>  waaah what if that was your mother or sister. shut up *****.  My mother could murder somebody and I'd still defend her.  Do i condone murder? no i dont, but that's blood, and I'll always defend my family. wtf is Rihanna to me?|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	,,,why is this even still news? Domestic violence is common.

I try not to speculate over the inner workings of the celebrity mind. Most celebrity related events nowadays are orchestrated deliberately.<br>  <br>  I still find it weird she couldn't hit him in the head or something with a shoe or something. I'd knock Chris Brown the **** out >_<. He looks like a real gaffot.<br>  <br>  As far as his own mother being a victim of domestic violence, That would me more reason for him to NOT give Rihanna a beatdown.<br>  <br>  In short, No.

R7VjuCT2aa	In my opinion it's spot on...EVERYTHING in the universe is relative depending on your point of view/perspective and there are no "moral laws" per se. Moral laws depends on countless factors and are not black and white.<br>  <br>  The universe is grey and indifferent.|`|xGNM8J6yaa	I always thought it was ironic.
Rmtfm7qnaa	It depends on why you're getting it. I totally agree about some of the add-ons that just add more "stuff" without adding anything real to the game are just pointless wastes of money. Personally, I prefer the ones where you get more like in pets (you can "control" and take care of the pets). <br>  Bon Voyage is nice in the fact that you're going on vacation... but that's just costing more money for more stuff in a different place and doesn't add anything substantial to the game. It makes it easier to work on your mood, fun, relationships, and sleep without having to worry about getting fired from work or kids taken away for skipping school.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't like the ones that just add building materials, clothes, or furniture because they are all the same basic stuff you've already got... it just looks different. That's why I don't like the Freetime or Deluxe ones as much. I see "Open for business" similar, but I like that there are more aspects of working instead of just driving off and time fast-forwarding 8-9 hours. I hope I helped!|`|AA11850311	1) FreeTime!!!!!  I love the sports and hobbies, plus the new clothes are great<br>  2) Open for Business - not so much for the business part, but I really like all the coordinating furniture and the new wallpapers<br>  3) Nightlife - yeah, there are cars, but with all the cars that you can get the don't require Nightlife, it's a little pointless now.

I also want to do some travelling, I'm from Europe and I'd like to visit other continents...but I can't do this before I finish school and get myself a job.<br>  <br>  I think it's normal to feel a bit lost when you're 22, well at least I do.|`|A0IvDqsGaa	my life is nothing what i expected.

Multiple Sclerosis, various forms of Cancer, degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's which rob you of life while you are still alive  and turning into a zombie of sorts...<br>  <br>  There are examples like the medical mass murderer Harold Shipman in the UK - and his true death toll will probably never be known, he picked on elderly patients and killed them, for financial gain and other unknown reasons, and to some he could be compared to Dr Jack K...<br>  <br>  The Schiavo case is completely different on a number of reasons, the conflict between her family's catholic right to life ethic divided by medical opinion that she was brain dead (and therefore technically no longer alive) it sounds cruel but there have been instances where comatose patients have "woken up" but it is rare - when the brain stem is defined as non-functional and a respirator keeps you alive then that's just plain cruel. The fact that relatives can't take the executive decision to switch off.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, people have DNR (do not resuscitate) clauses in their will or stamped with their donor card and driving license, which allows patients to be allowed to die (sort of) naturally.

j6Sv8eWYaa	Literally man<br>  <br>  after the american civil war, many former slaves moved to the fertile land surrounding the Mississippi River to rebuild their lives as farmers. alot of little shanty towns sprung up on the banks of the Mississippi, and it became necessary to build a Levee to protect them. it was in these towns that blues music was born. in 1913 the river flooded and destroyed the levee and the shanty towns with it. following the flood, most of the former inhabitants of these towns moved either north to Chicago (this is mentioned in the song) or south to New Orleans, which is why these cities later produced so many incredible bluesmen who were an inspiration to Led Zeppelin.|`|hGVkInSnaa	It's a cover song first recorded by husband and wife Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie in 1929. The song is about Great Missippi Flood of 1927.

Robert Plant moved and added lyrics, reworking the song entirely. The way that the music was set up, with frenzied instruments building to a cresendo, was meant to mimic the arrival of a flood. Even the super crazy part at the end is meant to symbolize the crazy sounds of the flood and everything going down [Robert Plant deliberately muddled his voice, even]<br>  <br>  So, yes, it was based on a flood originally, and Zeppelin evolved the idea a bit.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Wow, I think the first dude said it all!! <br>  <br>  But yeah, I have always taken it literally. I've never really thought about the levee representing his emotions and brain...interesting interpretation though. I guess, in the end, its up to us to draw our own ideas of what a song is about, you know. Awesome song, that. One of my Led Zep favourites! :)|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	While I agree that the song has a literal origin and no doubt meant only that to song authors Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy, it's easy to see this in a more spiritual context of a "doomsday" type song and for that reason the song continues to feel relevant today. <br>  <br>  As an example, you can take the line "I works on the levee, mama both night and day, I works so hard, to keep the water away" literally as a worker who watches the structural integrity of the levee. Or alternately you can view the "levee" as a metaphor for your mind and the "water" as events that are causing an inevitable rush toward the end of the world. Your mind tries to keep you from thinking about them but inevitably they will come to the fore. These interpretations seem natural to me for any African-American songwriter coming of age in the "Bible Belt".

I actually carried that through and fantasy is not the same as reality. They said that we would travel and see the world !!

3WItFAwlaa	Interesting....<br>  <br>  Prenatal eclipses are thought to be significant.  Jan Spiller wrote about them in Spiritual Astrology.  <br>  <br>  I think I understand your question.  For instance, someone could have Pluto Conjunct Mars in their natal chart.  Prior to birth Mars would've been applying to Pluto.  We can speculate, that during that time there couldn't be some kind of danger to the fetus.  It would interesting to get data on mothers who experience premature labor but do not give birth til much later.  Or even spotting or some other crisis.  Then look at the transits to the natal chart once the baby was born.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	say, if mercury / saturn conjunction has a physical effect on people in quantum level or whatever, you should feel that in the womb as well. so, someone who born when the aspect was at 0 degrees, he/she also felt whatever is that effect inside the womb when it was 0.1 too.<br>  <br>  i don't believe something like a... um... lightning effect. like, they don't send whatever they can "just for you" and only in the moment you have born. (planets)<br>  <br>  planets, houses and their positions haven't got their meanings from some god or holy book or whatever. people keep keeping statistics, like, this person born when this planet was here. 150 more people also born while that planet was there. SO that planet's effects should be x, y and z. same goes for aspects.<br>  <br>  in fact, i think you begin receiving those effects in the moment that sperm and egg met. the picture of skies in the moment you have born doesn't really what's affected you, we just use it as a map to come to conclusions.<br>  <br>  like, if there was a super computer of sorts which can calculate what aspects take place from the moment you become a living "thing" to the moment you have born, that would be a trascendental sort of astrology which can tell everything...<br>  <br>  one wonders...|`|8TCiGHKaaa	I'm not too clear on your question, but I have observed that once an aspect starts to separate, the energy punch is reduced rather dramatically.  Hence the use of smaller orbs.<br>  <br>  I think you might be confusing yourself with the orbs.  They just are what they are...|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Depends on where you are born
rYA2KCnUaa	yes, i hope so too, did you see the look on Ashley's face when Brad granted Colleen his trust in his will? That was she gets, for falling in love with a man that is completely wrong for her.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, me too, but i hope she doesn't  get caught up with Jack's mess.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I think Jack is going to make her try to get Brad's seat on the Newman board, which l think is wrong because she really doesn't belong there. But with Ashley in the run for the seat also, maybe she'll try to spite Colleen and get back at Brad for not leaving her in care of Abby's inheritance. Should be interesting.|`|nndflDc9aa	Lol Collen is playing with fire. Just hope at the end she doesn't get hurt . <br>  Lol Like Victor always say that is his Company & not Brad or Collen to decide anything or any1 else for that matter they should just respect& know that this is Victor Business and he decide how his business rules maybe Victor will see it other wise lol every1 wanna own Victor Company and leaving him in the alter lol  where are they going ? Victor have good reason not to trust Brad or his family cause they all try to steal  his own Company. What do u guys expected him to do ?
EPPb5pRBaa	I think so. I think the writer already have it planned in.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	i am wondering the same thing, its usually three strikes with couple on the soaps, when you kiss that is strike one and when you have sex, that is strike two and when you go for the third time for sex again then the marriage ends up on divorce.|`|nndflDc9aa	I know Karen will have enough off Neil supporting Tyra 2 much so that  will leave them to a divorce. I will do the same long time ago if I was karen and If I saw my Hobby and other grl kissing. Divorce is the answer no matter what.|`|xUUkIzU9aa	don't like this story line, never liked Neil, Karen should never of married him, and also don't like Tyra.|`|WtolR399aa	eventully|`|uUzbqGh5aa	You never know, we just might see a more determined Karen come back to face Tyra. She may want to seek some kind of revenge in an invisible kind of way to keep Tyra away from Neil. If Olivia has anything to say about it, Neil is going to stay married to Karen.|`|Oon31342aa	Hopefully. Karen is nice but she is super boring.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Karen knew before they got married that Tyra was on the prowl and she made moves to prevent it happening.  I think she will not confront, but try again to manipulate things in the background.  Always backfires.  She'll become the bad guy instead of the cheaters.  Funny how that works.  So I guess maybe divorce in the end.  That's my prediction.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	of course, the writers planned this all along because they want Tyra w/ Neil.  After that happens, Dru will come back to Neil's surprise|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I hope not. I don't like Tyra much anymore.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	I hope she does...too bad, I liked Karen.
c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I'd do it because if it happened to me I'd expect the same.|`|G2WgHzu5aa	I am thinking about getting divorced before my husband gets too old to wipe himself, however, now that you made a good point about breaking wrists and such I have to go call my lawyer.|`|607b1fd847df57a87418944d4b6ce916aa	if by wiping it you mean "hose it down", yeah, I'd do that for my honey~|`|p03Jc7eHaa	hire a nurse|`|707gOCvbaa	That same tush  most of you refuse to wipe was one wiped many moons ago by a loving Mother. I would. Put on a mask and wear latex. It's that simple. I guess none of you ever took care of a elderly or bedridden parent?|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Ha!  This has a true ring to it.  Are you related to my s/o?*|`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	then she obviously doesnt put out often enough!|`|zEp6xHacaa	that's why there are trained helper monkeys|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	uh absolutely not...i love the man but i have to draw the line somewhere|`|lC5NLsZZaa	Yes....it is the ultimate act of love. Just ask Elton John.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i wipe two of them now, whats one more? besides, he might like it??? ;)|`|BwZJXbSjaa	yes, i would honestly do anything for my s/o|`|Zky0yJqCaa	I had a metal bar on my right wrist at one point. It wasn't easy trying to do certain things with only my left hand.......... (right handed) I'm thankful I had a hubby that helped me out.<br>  <br>  I would if I had to LeRoy.|`|G9FiXGvmaa	I'd totally be willing to hire someone to change the diaper.|`|AQ4b4Iilaa	Yes|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	Of course I would!|`|9xnwKZ3yaa	Yes I would.

I could use the practice|`|G6Uy43coaa	Of course I would.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	No biggie...I've wiped many a @$$e$ in my day. He better flush that stink before I get in there though.|`|Ucovfo2Xaa	i guess...i help my 3 year old wipe her butt so i dont think i would have too much problem with it|`|fT15YEkFaa	yes I would|`|AA11523465	I suppose I'd have to.  I've given him a bath before when he was sick, so what the hell?|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i'd buy a bidet|`|vENQ2NJjaa	I sprained 1 arm and broke the other arm at the same time<br>  So I have dealt with something similar to this<br>  Just pushed through the pain with the sprained arm<br>  Because Madeleine wipes her own *** dammit!|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	ewwwwwwwwww no, nobody want to wipe anybody elses hiney|`|a7TgRnL3aa	Hell to the no LeRoy|`|d3kRpqKGaa	Now that is a smelly situation.|`|fwpw3kvlaa	As long as other body parts were still functioning, no problem!|`|QADdomjeaa	How did they break both of their wrists?

nDSLNnguaa	Honestly I can't really think of any! <br>  They were a cultural phenomenon with a following unlike any other.  Whether you actually made it in to see the show or not it was an experience unlike any other. (like how I said unlike any other twice!)   Although I never followed them across country I was fortunate to experience them in Atlanta before Jerry Garcia's death.<br>  <br>  Unreal!!!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: I did have friends that would take the summer to just follow them from city to city.  They managed to do it with very little money but the followers were such that they all helped each other out~ kind of like in the 60's but this was late 80's early 90's.  You probably won't see anything like that today!<br>  <br>  Edit Edit: yeah, I was thinking Dave Matthews Band would be closest.  But even still nothing like the Grateful Dead!<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh wow!  I feel like I'm in college again! Widespread Panic used to play in the bars at Tuscaloosa!|`|7nRom97Daa	there are no bands like them, you had to be there & part of the whole concert to concert, city to city thing to really understand. I spent one year traveling with my husband doing this, we sold salami & bologna sandwiches at the concerts to fund our trip  to the next one.|`|sFASHCNRaa	as for devoted fans...i'd kind of have to say my chemical romance. other than that, i don't think other bands fans are quite as devoted as them.<br>  <br>  i mean, teens line up a day and a half before the concert just to get seats...|`|aKBqMLuhaa	None. The closest thing would be Phish and that is not even close. Ok and maybe Widespread Panic.<br>  <br>  You use to be able to trust people at Dead shows (for the most part). People actually cared about others. Today that doesn't exist in  society anywhere. At Dead shows when I needed something (help with anything, food, drugs, clothes....) people would freely offer it without expectation of anything but a kind gesture in return. At Phish shows you get ripped off.<br>  The only thing that is a like about these shows are  that people go out on tour and travel from show to show; but there is nothing like a good ol' Dead Show.<br>  <br>  <-Deadhead, Phish~head, Spreadhead.|`|ZtCyxfpfaa	Phish has the same kind of followers and similar sound.

AA11601079	To an extent. It's also because they know he's talented and would have probably won one eventually, and this would be their last real chance to give him one.<br>  <br>  The Academy is always giving people Oscars for certain films when they deserved it for others. Think about Russell Crowe getting it for "Gladiator" because they felt bad not giving it to him for "The Insider." Or Alan Arkin winning for "Little Miss Sunshine" because they knew he was getting up there and hadn't won yet. (I'm not even sure he'd been nominated since "The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.") Do you think Morgan Freeman deserved it for "Million Dollar Baby" so much as they were making up for passing him over for "Shawshank" and "Driving Miss Daisy?" And Kate Winslet is finally going to win, but it's not going to be for "The Reader" so much as "Sense and Sensibility" and "Titanic."|`|61fyNCYhaa	yeah I believe so<br>  like joaquin phoenix in walk the line,he was amazing there and I had no doubt that he was gonna win but he didn't. he really deserved it<br>  and so many others like leonardo dicaprio or johnny depp or ...|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Why did "Shakespeare In Love" win over "Saving Private Ryan" for best Picture? "Chicago" won also and I couldn't even finish the movie. I guess because there is a lot of very talented phags and knuckleheads in Hollywood.|`|hqfH47tHaa	It's all a matter of opinion I think..I didn't see Brokeback Mountain (yuck!) but I did see Dark Knight and I think he deserves the oscar even if he was alive.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Oscars are often given for past work.  Cher was excellent in "Mask," but won for "Moonstruck."  Paul Newman was so good in "The Verdict," but won for "The Color of Money" which I feel is a Tom Cruise film!|`|StqBr5XRaa	politics

LmARYQxcaa	Good morning precious...I don't date pigs anymore.|`|yGm29f3Eaa	And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig ****, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig"|`|a7TgRnL3aa	Lol at Naka:)  Mornin sweets!  ^^^^^ haha Cis, I have the membership card still, but sadly, the store is gone...|`|qYrBYtSKaa	I used to eat a place called Whistle Pig.<br>  <br>  MMM Hot Dog with processed cheese and Bacon and hot sause<br>  <br>  DAmit I want a dog now|`|foGvzgLJaa	Not yet.....<br>  <br>  Morning!|`|AKVQNGcOaa	no, but i think i was attacked my a chicken once lmao<br>  <br>  lol love the "good morning" greeting XD|`|c5bOFwaQaa	me i would be like a demon to pigs. 99% meat eater.<br>  so it would eat them.|`|106uKaEYaa	No!|`|QlQz9NJraa	Not so far as I know.|`|ZYoqZ2Xsaa	Yes, but I put peanut butter on it.|`|bticQDIhaa	Yes, my Uncle Jim Bob was.

AA12352139	That's what being beaten 'beyond recognition' does to you. <br>  <br>  If it wasn't her, the police would not be investigating how the picture leaked!<br>  <br>  Shame on CB. He should be sent down for a couple of years to get him straightened out.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	i think so :O|`|FcHplZtQaa	Yes, thats what someone looks like when their face is swollen from being beaten, what a piece of shite that Chris Brown is!|`|lkNJNnlSaa	YES<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-rihanna.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/ce...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (Look at the Tat)<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the first i've seen this pic of her, that Chris Brown is a di-ckhead - he will get away with it because he is a celeb.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Yeah because of the tattoo, its disgusting if chris brown did do it. Theres never a reason for a man to hit a woman.|`|ixPskp3Oaa	It's her.|`|VS62RJQSaa	ya thats her no one deserves that for no good reason i hate chris|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	It is absolutely her. She is not wearing makeup and has been viciously attacked. It is a raw photo with no alterations. It is also close up so her features look bigger. Let's not try to delude ourselves into thinking this isn't her. They are already trying to find out how the photo was leaked. I'm glad it was leaked. Why should Chris Brown be protected?<br>  Mrs. Col....she wasn't at the grammys. This is evidence of how people change history and make sh it up. SHE WASN"T AT THE GRAMMYS.<br>  She was at the grammy pre-party, prior to the attack. What in the world are you rambling about???|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Yes, probably the swelling from the beating has made her face look bigger.<br>  It is an evidence photo, for the police, so whoever leaked this seriously hasn't get her best interests at heart.<br>  The tattoo's give it away.<br>  <br>  I hope she can heal and move on. <br>  Chris Brown is a swine for this|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	yh it's just because shes not wearing makeup|`|otYTWy2uaa	I feel like its her as a victim of domestic violence myself I looked alot different when my ex had swollen my face.

I think its real.|`|cAY3Z9wLaa	doesnt look like it|`|MJyM1XWJaa	yikes that is her because of the tattoos on her shoulder. My goodness chris...wtf.|`|rPhP6ILgaa	Her face didnt look like that at the grammy's!!! I know for sure no makeup will cover that much damage up! Thats def her, but the other stuff was edited...didnt u watch the grammy's? that apparently happened that same day just look at the her grammy picture then u will know what Im talking about!!|`|DIihJrUiaa	I think it most likely is a photo of her, as the tattoo is accurate, and I think legal action would have been threatened by now if it wasn't her.|`|LqSPZbO3aa	Yeah it's her..you can tell because of the tattoo on her shoulder, it was in the Take a Bow video!<br>  <br>  The poor poor thing.

You can feel Roger Waters' anguish about how war causes loss and his hope fading away for a better solution. Anyone who follows Floyd knows that Waters lost his father in WW2, and he lets that pain flow through in the music here.<br>  <br>  A lot of people overlook this album -- it gets overshadowed by "The Wall," which I think is actually inferior to this album in a lot of ways. "The Final Cut" is more focused and more poignant and emotional. <br>  <br>  And yes, there is a lot of beauty in the sadness on this album, especially on "The Gunner's Dream."

A4IaSaaqaa	Dramas are those that show/explore the emotional conflicts that characters have to go through, regardless whether it was brought about by their previous experiences, environment, or their relationships with other people.<br>  <br>  Examples of sad are the various variants of Cinderella stories where there's always an authoritative figure abusing the poor girl, or someone who just recently learned that he/she was adopted and s/he's now trying to 'find the pieces of his/her past.'<br>  <br>  Tragedies have a similar nature, but they tend to have a sadder and darker tone and would sometimes use a good amount of symbolism. It usually includes a character/s death but a series/movie/story can be considered tragic even without death if it features a good amount of suffering, be it physical or emotional, especially if it was brought about by ironic circumstances.<br>  <br>  Say for example, no one died, but the main character discovered that the person he hates the most and can never forgive is his parent/sibling or that the main character gave up everything to gain a single goal and he realized that everything is not what he thought it would be or killing the person that meant the world to someone the character will love in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think you can have tragedy without having drama since they are roughly the same genre and just differs in the degrees of physical or emotional suffering they're willing to explore. <br>  <br>  You can try to think of drama as being sad and tragic as being depressed. Under normal circumstances, you would have to go through a period of sadness before you become actually depressed (I guess except in cases of people with bipolar disorder where they experience extremely high or extremely low emotions alternately, though I don't really know much about that).<br>  <br>  I don't know a lot of examples since I rarely watch series from these genres (though I actually like tragedies), but an example would be like:<br>  <br>  Sad:<br>  5 cm per second. It shows the sadness that main characters feel about being separated from each other. It also explores, alienation, confusion and the 'sacrifices' the characters have to make in relation to a decision.<br>  <br>  I also consider The Girl Who Leapt Through Time as sad though it does involve death in the sense that the atmosphere of the OVA/movie was a lot lighter than those that I consider to be tragic animes.<br>  <br>  Tragic:<br>  <br>  Grave of the fireflies<br>  It's tragic because first there is death, second, the characters suffered a whole lot more than just loneliness from being far from someone they like/love, the circumstances they found themselves in were much bleaker and difficult than the one the characters from 5cm per second found have to live with. Last, it uses some elements of irony (the one where the main character finally found some food to feed his sister just to discover that it's useless because she's already dead) and some symbolisms (the can of candies the male lead always carries around is somewhat tied to the memories of his sister).<br>  <br>  I also consider Light Yagami's death as tragic not because he's the main character and he died, but because he was a such a promising person and he let his ego ruined him, making him die like in the same manner the 'common criminals' he judged did.<br>  <br>  Samurai X Trust and Betrayal is also tragic because:<br>  Kenshin killed Tomoe's Fiancee - Tomoe planned to have vengeance against Kenshin but end up falling for him- Kenshin fell in love with her but instead of a happy ending, he ended up killing her<br>  <br>  Samurai X Reflections was tragic because there was a part where the legendary slasher that was feared by almost anyone can't even catch a fish on a stick anymore.|`|AA10153769	Drama manga are meant to bring on a strong emotional response in the reader.

7hWEiTQUaa	Thank God. You have been saved from the horrible machine that is the mainstream. This is a common story for a lot of pop punk bands. I was a fan of red jumpsuit apparatus from the time they were a little band in florida called In Fates Hands. Their sound has changed so much to fit into more of a mainstream role, I can barely listen to them anymore. The same with gym class heroes. I was out of the music scene for awhile and one day i walked into a gas station and saw them plastered on a case of mountain dew, a very sad day for me. Bands turning mainstream and selling out to appeal to a larger audience abslolutely destroys what once made the band really good. Music run by corporate machines, only intended to make money by appealing to the lowest common denominator, it all makes me sick. Thank god you're eyes have been open. That's really rare and really cool for someone your age. Ha i guess i went on a ramble as well. It's justthat all this stuff makes me so upset. All the teenie bopper Jonas Brothers loving people who steal from what truly makes music great, originality and quality|`|JZWzG04Gaa	i dnt get it|`|hGVkInSnaa	You're full of crap.

You know something is after you, but you aren't sure what it is. You can hear the leaves rustling underneath your bare feet, you can feel the cool breeze against your bare skin, but all that you can focus on is the fear. Your greatest fears all bundled together into a great torrent of pain. You suddenly lose the feeling in your legs and stumble, stagger, and tumble to the ground. Your skin crawls and aches seemingly out of nowhere. Your breathing becomes heavy and quick as you panic, looking around in the silence of the forest. Nothing. The silence surrounding you is unnoticeable from the voices and noises you hear in your head. Your emotions have completely transformed you into this... running from nothing... killing you slowly inside. You choke and gasp for breath, but nothing happens. You go into a seizure. You can't feel a thing. And suddenly everything goes dark...<br>  <br>  You awaken, startled, sweating, and breathing rapidly to find out it was all just a nightmare.|`|TudZYPN5aa	I had a dream that my dad was gay and my best friend was interested in him :(<br>  <br>  It was creepy<br>  <br>  (my parents are married and straight)|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Their family being murdered,<br>  By them!|`|QznZTz4aaa	Paris Hilton buying you and then dressing you up in a bear suit!|`|1vGfcIf1aa	you get hunted by demons because you played with a ouija board. these weird things happen to you and your always in pain. the demons torture you. until they finally kill you.<br>  =D|`|2734495ebe0db7825a50002a0b17e3edaa	Duuuuuuude!

7sXNwFynaa	the 12 go around the earth not the sun.|`|ftO9Sh3maa	I can see you have a few questions about constellations so I will try to explain the basics in a way that answers most of them.<br>  <br>  Many people believe that additional constellations debunk astrology. it is not the case - the system of 12 zodiac signs we use in the west is based on the constellations of the same name, but in a general sense. It is general like the color 'red' or 'blue' is general, but there are shades - Crimson, Burgundy, or Aquamarine, etc<br>  <br>  So they are both right - being general about certain traits, but if you subdivide signs into degrees and pay attention to fixed stars then it is possible to get the minute distinctions in shade. Just like the colour spectrum<br>  <br>  Furthermore, western astrology is based on the equinoxes and solstices, which are real measurable events for pinning the seasons on. We calculate signs based on those 4 points - a valid system. <br>  <br>  The most accurate constellation astrology is sidereal, like the vedic/indian system. It is based on exact constellations and fixed stars, and as a result of precession of the equinoxes is slowly changing from the western, tropical system.<br>  <br>  What constellations are most visible from where you are depends on exactly what latitude you are at. Look at online astronomy sites.

ynVelZ6zaa	YES. It was humiliating beyond description.<br>   I was late from sport and had science next. I ran to the lab and walked through the door while mumbling an apology to my teacher and went to my seat, but some guy was in it and I was like 'excuse me you're in my seat and we have to sit in our designated spots.' He just looked at me and said 'are u even in this class?' That's when it dawned on me that my teacher had a class before mine and my class was waiting outside the lab. It was sooooo embarrasing because everyone was looking at me. I made sure I was always just on time with moments to spare for that class from then on lol.|`|uB2K3XD0aa	no but i once walked in into a packed complex analysis course the first day and the professor came in introduced himself and realized that there were too many people in the class...so what he did was started to jot some derivations and theorems on the board and then in a matter of seconds...the class went from 40 to like 15. we all started laughing at them...the people who left were signed up for and introductory course in economics that was being held next door....|`|DjbCw7ePaa	First day of college...

7M8Pf378aa	What she is saying is " she loves you but she doesnt want to love you in any way" she isnt contradicting herself but saying she has no control over loving you even if in her mind she does not want to, she cant help it.

6fsBkK7saa	To be honest, I don't listen to (or like) rap at all. I like rock, punk, hardcore, metal, etc. But my little brother loves rap and hiphop so I've heard lots of it, and in my opinion Eminem sounds best of all rappers I've heard. It may not be my type of music, but I admit the guy has talent for it, he has a great sense of rhythm and his lyrics are crazy, and he makes it all fit right. Not anyone could pull that off. Also, his songs are only rap songs that don't sound the same to me.. That means something. I even like a few, when I'm in the mood.|`|dPKkjK8iaa	I love eminem... his whole story of how he grew up and the movie 8 mile is just so inspiring and it really does show that it does not matter where you have come from that you can reach your dreams :) he has some of the best rap songs ever made and i love him!!!!!!|`|pfJorlTIaa	He's Good, but Seriously, are you Kidding??|`|noKmxO8Vaa	No he's not.|`|VS62RJQSaa	not the best but pretty good|`|StqBr5XRaa	no
AIhL8wLkaa	According to wiki:<br>  <br>  In a September issue of NME, Josh Homme stated that he was going back to make the new QOTSA and Desert Sessions records along with remastering the 1998 self titled album for an early 2009 release. Homme also stated Queens' new album is going to be a "desert orgy in the dark."

07YBD5mJaa	It's not out of the ordinary for a young child to have imaginary friends at all. I had a few of my own, cant remember what I named them or what we did together, but I do remember my parents telling me about them.<br>  Young children, conversely, are generally quite psychologically healthy when conceiving an imaginary friend. Studies further show that such children may enhance their self-esteem by having a friend who treats them with the utmost respect, and unconditional love. Children are also attempting to define the difference between fantasy and reality. As they mature, in most cases, the imaginary friend becomes less real, though the friend may remain a treasured memory of innocent days.|`|jfwmelYgaa	2|`|FwJLD1uDaa	haha yep! i dont care if its weird, they were AWESOME! :D|`|9iNCQkWlaa	I have to wait for my little rice krispies to tell me what to say.

It doesn't change my opinion that Chris Brown is a brutal ape, because what he did was horrendous.|`|0JjTt1rQaa	no because he was still wrong for hitting her. Guys should never hit girls|`|U4GamLClaa	thats not true!!|`|MZWH11w1aa	Any man should be a big enough man to not hit a woman.  Even it its not hitting her back.  No it doesn't change my mind about anything.  Do you honestly think Rihanna could hurt Chris with a punch?  that's laughable.  If he was smart he would have grabbed her wrists to stop her.  Then he could have just left or called the police and pressed charges against her.  Instead he acted like a BOY instead of a MAN.  In life there are consequences for every one of your actions.  Some good, some bad.  It's time they both faced theirs.  By the way, I don't think it's okay for a woman to hit a man either.

P0Fjh59Eaa	No. They never married, they set a date for the wedding which was to be on Valentines Day but Chloe broke up w/Lucas because she was feeling guilty about cheating on him w/Dr. Daniel Jonas (who is Salem's new manwhore).<br>  <br>  The goofiest scenes were the other day w/Chloe in the park crying after a chance meeting w/Lucas and his daughter Ally. Lucas got upset and told her that he was sick of her excuses for breaking up w/him and wanted to know the real reason. Chloe, of course, didn't tell him the truth and kept saying it was "for the best".  After Lucas left her in the park a Catholic Priest came across her and she confessed everything to him, he told her to pray to god for answers in who to be with, then after her prayer her cell phone rang, but we don't know if it was Lucas calling or Dr. Jonas as both were shown calling at the same time.<br>  <br>  Lucas fell of the wagon and got piss drunk and Maggie went after him. Maggie finally told Lucas that Chloe was cheating on him w/Dr. Jonas and Lucas vowed to kill him.  the previews from yesterday showed an explosion at Dr. Jonas' apartment, where i think Chloe was so i have no idea if Lucas went there w/a bomb for Dr. Jonas or what!<br>  Chloe is rotten, i just cannot stand her.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Not right now.

mtaMzeG2aa	Lots of good ones, Cheer up!<br>  <br>  A cruise ship in the Pacific sinks.<br>  There are only 3 Survivors; Damian, Darren and Deirdre. They manage to swim to a small island and they lived there for a couple of years doing what's natural for men and women to do.<br>  After several years of casual sex, all the time, Deirdre felt absolutely horrible about what she was doing. She felt having sex with Damian and Darren was so bad that she killed herself.<br>  It was tragic but Damian and Darren managed to get through it. After a while, nature once more took its inevitable course.<br>  A couple more years went by and Damian and Darren began to feel absolutely horrible about what they were doing.<br>  <br>  So they buried Deirdre.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Sixty is the worst age to be said the 60-year-old man. You always feel like you have to pee and most of the time you stand there and nothing comes out.<br>  Ah, that's nothing said the 70-year-old. When you're seventy, you don't have a bowel movement any more. You take laxatives, eat bran, sit on the toilet all day and nothing comes out.<br>  Actually said the 80-year -old, Eighty is the worst age of all.<br>  Do you have trouble peeing, too?' asked the 60-year old. No, I pee every morning at 6:00. I pee like a racehorse on a flat rock; no problem at all. So, do you have a problem with your bowel movement? No, I have one every morning at 6:30.<br>  The 60-year-old said you pee every morning at 6:00 and do a number 2 every morning at 6:30. So what's so bad about being 80?'<br>  <br>  I don't wake up until 7:00<br>  =============================<br>  A school-teacher asks her class to use the word "contagious."<br>  Roland, the teacher's pet, gets up and says, "Last year I got the measles and my mum said it was contagious."<br>  "Well done Roland," says the teacher. "Can anyone else try?" <br>  Katie, a sweet little girl with pigtails, says, "My grandma says there's a bug going round, and it's contagious."<br>  "Well done, Katie," says the teacher. "Anyone else?" Little Seamus speaks up and says, <br>  "Our next door neighbour is painting his house with a two-inch brush, and my dad says it will take the cont-agious."<br>  ===================================<br>  Three women go to Heaven. St Peter says, "We only have one rule here in Heaven: don't step on the ducks."<br>  They enter Heaven, and there are ducks all over the place and although they try their best to avoid them, the first woman accidentally steps on one.<br>  St Peter chains a really ugly man to her and says, "Your punishment is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man."<br>  The second woman steps accidentally on a duck, and St Peter chains another ugly man to her.<br>  The third woman was very careful where she stepped. A while later, St Peter chained a handsome man to her. He was tall, tanned, slim and muscular. (A bit like me!)<br>  The woman, thinking that this is great, remarks, "I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity."<br>  The guy says, "I don't know about you, but I stepped on a duck."<br>  =-====================================...<br>  A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:<br>  You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!<br>  So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:<br>  Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.<br>  She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the<br>  sign reads:<br>  Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.<br>  "That's nice," she thinks, "but I want more."<br>  So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:<br>  Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good<br>  Looking.<br>  "Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.<br>  She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:<br>  Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.<br>  "Oh, mercy me!" she exclaims, "I can hardly stand<br>  it!" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:<br>  Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.<br>  She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:<br>  Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no<br>  men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.<br>  PLEASE NOTE:<br>  To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.The first floor has wives that love sex.<br>  The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.|`|a1XEf8lKaa	The doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. <br>  <br>  You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.' <br>  <br>  Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life. <br>  <br>  He saw a men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new suit.' <br>  <br>  He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.' <br>  <br>  The elderly tailor eye d him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 long.' <br>  <br>  Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?' <br>  <br>  'Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said. <br>  <br>  Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly. <br>  <br>  As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?' <br>  <br>  Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.' <br>  <br>  The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.' <br>  <br>  Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?' <br>  <br>  'Been in the business 60 years.' <br>  <br>  Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly. <br>  <br>  Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?' <br>  <br>  Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure.' <br>  <br>  The salesman said, 'Let's see.... size 36. <br>  <br>  Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.' <br>  <br>  The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.' <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  New suit - $400<br>  New shirt - $36<br>  New underwear - $6<br>  Second Opinion - PRICELESS|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	The out of the night came a terrible scream who put the sand in the vaseline.,?????|`|VhHVjMe8aa	Two blonds walked into a building....you would think one of them would have seen it!|`|ItQOLOSXaa	A man has a weird nervous disposition. He will go to say a common household object, but under stress blurt out something rude.<br>  Anyway he journeys into town to run a few errands. The first he needs is a bucket. He walks into the ironmonger's, has a look around, and asks the assistant, "I want a f***et." Blushing, the assistant replies, "I'm sorry sir?" "Er, I need a f***et." The manager overhears and understands the situation, and walks out into the store to resolve it. "It's OK, we've had him in before, he just wants a bucket."<br>  So the man gets his bucket and walks on to the pet shop to pick up a dog for his grandmother. He walks up to the counter and says, "Get me cock-and-spanket." Again the assistant is stunned, to which the man repeats, "I want my cock-and-spanket". Again the manager hears it and reveals they've had an order in for a cocker spaniel. The assistant apologises to the man and retrieves it for him.<br>  The man is now feeling a little peckish and so walks on to the deli. Spying a cheese bun in the window, he walks in and asks for a "bum". Again there's some confusion before he can leave with his bun.<br>  Now he feels like he wants to sit down and eat before he goes home, so he wanders over to the park, puts down his bucket and cocker spaniel's lead, and sits down. There's a dog barking in the distance, and the cocker spaniel gets overexcited and runs off in the direction of the bark.<br>  Panicking, the man runs up to a stranger and says, "Excuse me, would you hold onto my bum and f***et while I grab my cock-and-spanket?"|`|2iJTL7AVaa	Pickle Slicer<br>  <br>  Bill worked in a pickle factory.

He vowed to overcome the compulsion on<br>  his own. One day a few weeks later, Bill came home<br>  absolutely ashen. His wife could see at once that something<br>  was seriously wrong. "What's wrong, Bill?" she asked.<br>  "Do you remember that I told you how I had this tremendous<br>  urge to put my penis into the pickle slicer?" "Oh, Bill,<br>  you didn't." "Yes, I did." "My God, Bill, what happened?"<br>  "I got fired." "No, Bill. I mean, what happened with<br>  the pickle slicer?" "Oh...she got fired too."|`|Ui9EQkDUaa	2 dwarfs pull 2 girls and take them home. 1st dwarf just cant get it up, to make things worse, all night he hears 2nd dwarf saying "1 2 3 uuuh!" next morning 1st dwarf says "how embarrassing i couldn't get erection" 2nd dwarf says "you think that'sats bad, i couldn't get on the f**king bed" :op|`|pZ9bpSTxaa	Whats the worst thing about being a paedophile<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You don't fit in<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  How do you get four gays on a bar stool<br>  <br>  <br>  Turn it upside down|`|D1c8cRM4aa	10 points to Polonius...that was hilarious!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	how do you keep an idiot in suspense?

r5qgrAzQaa	There is no specific amount of time to become good.  I have seen naturals pick up the guitar and become very good in a short amount of time.  Personally it took me years to get the level I am at now.  Practice is the key (a lot of it) in order to get "good".  Once you master your chords I would work on scales.  They are important to learn in order to understanding progressions and what keys songs are in.  This will allow you to write and play some amazing stuff.  Changing you from  good to great.|`|23JqybDCaa	Depends on your audience.<br>  If you play in front of someone who can't play, they'll think your awesome.<br>  I've been playing for about 10 years now, and I'm still not as good as I'd like to be.<br>  <br>  Keep practicing, you'll get there.|`|1t9YljoOaa	Haha. I dont think people can become guitars =P<br>  <br>  I dont play the guitar. My brother just got one recently, and im planning on learning to play on it. But I'd say some 6 months? At least. To master all the basics and stuff.|`|AA12034546	I've been playing since 1974 and am not nearly as good as I could be with a bit of discipline and a ton more practice. One very important factor in reaching your full potential as a player is to play with others. You'll learn something new every time you play with someone else, no matter what their skill level might be. Don't be discouraged and keep at it.

aSoCKVJ3aa	No, I wouldn't let them. I would be afraid it would cause nightmares and linger with them for awhile. Children are exposed to too much violence today.|`|AA10283080	No.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if it's just a film. Children get desensitized by seeing things like that at such an early age and I don't want my child to be desensitized to such things.|`|Lq2psnTqaa	Yes because I am from NC|`|GGUDvicaaa	1. I was teen and watched Lust for a vampire - despite porn title, it′s gothic vamp film with some tame and tasteful topless lesbianism. No damage done, unlike being in school surrounded by  sewermouthed violent pupils.<br>  2. I am 37 and don′t watch sleazy horror movies. I don′t let crap like that to pollute my home.<br>  .|`|frwlypDWaa	I say traumatize the hell out of 'em. Gets them ready for the realities of adulthood...|`|0cMVKUnAaa	I was probably 10 or 11 when I watched Saw|`|n55igpCUaa	Sure... just leave me out ^_^<br>  <br>  I'm just a wuss... can't deal with a brutal bloody/gorey movie.|`|oztoPKrGaa	umm.<br>  The older movies are fine.<br>  But the newer ones there is always sex and nudity.<br>  Like my bloody valentine.<br>  That was strange to watch w/ even just my boyfriend<br>  It shows her whole * private part* <br>  we were going to invite his family. thank God we didnt.<br>  and like umm... the wrong turn 2. I watched thatw/ my grandpa and it has a girl suckiing some guys dick, it has her breast showing and it has two insest creeps ******* in the woods and a guy jacking off.<br>  <br>  we both got up and left the room and like couldnt talk to each other all night.<br>  It was so wierd..<br>  <br>  To answer your question no i wouldnt let my 10 yearold watch it.<br>  maybe once they got older.<br>  There going to end up seeing it anyways either at a friends, paperview or what ever.<br>  So...cant really freak about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  but the whole scared issue...<br>  If they begged me to watch it they better not come wake me up in the middle of the night w/ nightmares:) lol jk<br>  I still forget movies are fake.<br>  Im only 18 though<br>  no kids|`|AMI8oQMDaa	It would depend on my child's age, the movie, and how well my child can tell fantasy from reality. There are people in their 30's who probably shouldn't watch PG-13 movies because of the lack of maturity. I guess it's personal preference.|`|Hwh6GlNTaa	I was 6 when I watched Saw. My family corrupted me. DX<br>  To answer your question, yea. If I had any and they were at least 13. It really depends. They can watch some scary movies, but as for some of the movies. Nope.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Depends on the child.  Some are more sensitive than others.  I know parents that were appalled that I took my 3 and 5 year old sons to see "The Dark Knight."|`|uzBWEZnoaa	:| I watched hostel..It was nasty...I couldn't look half the time... But no way would I let a child watch that..<br>  :D xx|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	depends if  they are >=17 years old|`|b5ecvoTnaa	nah. I wouldn't let them watch it.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	if my kids are under 10 then no, but if they are 10 or over iwould probably let them watch it in the day, so they wont be so scared and they wont annoyed me at night. i dont have any but that is probably what i would do.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	It depends on how mature the child is. Some children cannot comprehend the fact that movies like that aren't real, some can. The former children might be traumatised by such movies. I wouldn't take the chance!|`|ZrjGrFwzaa	No...even though it is fake, the images and story remain in the brain, corrupting it...where do you think serial killers get their ideas from?|`|9TQrtSoiaa	If i had kids I prob wouldnt let them watch any torture films like that simply because its more realistic then most..|`|VlUF8PmIaa	SCARY MOVIES YES... ROMANCE NO,,,|`|ofEb1uRLaa	I would not let my children watch the movie "Saw".
fIEmi84Laa	What's worse than what happened to Rihanna is the fact that it's happening to many women, way worse, on a daily basis. Chris is a jerk and so is any person who would this to anyone (male or female).|`|67QVKHQ3aa	he wont have a cellmate b/c hes a celebrity they will house him seperatley, and to tell you the truth his accomodations wont be that bad, he will get a t.v. and probly good food too..|`|pian616Daa	Anyone who think that Domestic Violence should be tolerated should be imprisoned themselves. Regardless of the circumstances, i heard there was a row, the STD rumor is NOT factual, there is no excuse for any man to lay a hand on a woman, or even for a woman to assault a man. I do not condone any violence of this scale. At least he was respectable enough to hand himself in, I respect Mr Brown for doing so. I wish Rhiannaa the best of luck in getting back on track, and I hope that Chris Brown has to take anger management courses for a very long time and that he takes his stint in jail as a lesson.|`|8871u9gMaa	it's awful.<br>  there's no way chris' actions can be justified, whatever the circumstances. it's disgusting and cruel, and should never...um...happen<br>  this just irritates me so much. he will probably get special treatment in prison as well. ugh.<br>  :[<br>  xx|`|DyORD0Zkaa	i think it was his right i mean his duty to beat her for giving him STD cuz she could have warned him but she didnt cuz she was selfish and wanted to take someone else down with her|`|0181a3f7f3262a3d804a0613a20c8d7daa	Yeah, but chances are his cellmate(s) are equally horrible.  They're not in jail for going to church, that's for sure.
40kCOPicaa	<a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/en" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensubtitles.org/en</a> is the BEST resource. comprehensive list of movies that are subtitled, and easy to download. they have helpful FAQs too.<br>  <br>  however, my hint is that if you download a small text document, and just make sure that it is named the same thing as your .avi file (it'll end in .srt instead), then Windows should hook them up in Media Player automatically (make sure they're in the same folder too).<br>  <br>  Alternatively, if you're using Region-Free software (I recommend DVD Region-Free), then it can sync subtitles and video.<br>  <br>  It's sometimes fun to go into the subtitles and change some of the words around (such as a character's name) to be the name of a friend with whom you're watching the movie. Especially when it quickly becomes obvious that this isn't their real name.

e8QQW8Weaa	i didn't read all of that. but smoking weed is so much better for you than alcohol and ciggs. media has such a bad impression on marijuana that now everyone thinks its TERRIBLE for you and some hardcore drug (trust me, don't ask a question that even QUESTIONS promoting it or you might get b**ched out!)<br>  <br>  weed is not bad, but it wont get legalized. hell, they even want to ban cigarettes like everywhere now!|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Because tobacco and alcohol were far to popular to make illegal when the drug laws began.<br>  <br>  Berry, <br>  No. Actually weed is very VERY illegal in the united states.|`|uwtvDgxCaa	Yeah that's what I say man....If all three are bad for you, then why legalize only 2 of them? Actually alcholol is so much more worse for you than weed is! Tobacco is too!<br>  <br>  <br>  WTF PEOPLE???|`|G4qG1Zakaa	I thought weed WAS legal.<br>  <br>  I don't live in the U.S.|`|p2E60yBSaa	Weed is not bad for you at all really and can actually be a much healthier pain killer than the harsh drugs that get prescribed. Everyone just love alcohol too much to downplay it because it helps them forget about their problems or helps them dwell on them depending on the person. Lastly cigarettes are as bad as their rep and worse, you can never understand how crappy being addicted to something you don't actually like is. You just satisfy a craving your body and or mind has developed.|`|EEPxttfbaa	Uhm, I'm guessing because cigs don't make you high. And drinking has a limit at 21 (usually) because you should be responnsible enough to not be drunk in certain situations. Weed is different..|`|lB7PX2Voaa	Because not everyone's like you and/or reacts to it the same way. Some people can handle it and some can't. That's why. It's a controlled substance like Prozac and Xanax, etc... And honestly do you think senate, judicial and exectutive are going to shut down alcohol and tobbacco consumption in this country? I think not.|`|AA10409668	Weed, cigarettes, and liquor are for losers.  -----------------------

AA11504809	she's clearly messed up, her parents situation doesnt' help either. freddie is sweet, but effy just isn't into the idea of a proper loving relationship with a guy, which is why she goes for cook, it's just sex with him, no strings attached. I really thought after freddie swam out to her in the water and they kissed that they'd end up together, but cook is sly in a way, because freddie headbutted him, he knows freddie likes effy, I'd say he's only with effy to get back at freddie. the look on his face at the window proved that.
aSoCKVJ3aa	Organized religion can be a good thing for people who like to socialize and have their personal life invaded by other church members.

Lol. =]|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	I manage without any religious beliefs.|`|ycRwO0kWaa	YES|`|Jf6cke5naa	Well yes in a way because i was taught good morals and it gave me a sense of meaning in life. But on the other hand no because it can cause contention and in the end you have to choose friends or family because religion limits you from who you hang around with and what you do because everyone has different beliefs and they can conflict with yours. In my opinion being in a religion limits you from experiencing life, i know this because for a while now i've stopped believing in my religion, when i found out it's teachings are false. It was heart breaking at first but i've moved on.|`|xYHyTJY9aa	I'm not sure its good for you but it does give some reassurances.   <br>  <br>  My life is better for it because it gives me somewhere to go where the people have the same outlook as me.   Wonderful way to make friends and it gives me something to look forward to ... I actually enjoy the whole comraderie of being in the religious building during a service.  <br>  <br>  Does that answer your question.|`|fdFGiCeNaa	i'm not gunna name any religion, <br>  <br>  BUT, religion in some parts is totally corrupt. people have very strong views about certain things, and believe it will ultimately get them a date with god. its so stupid the things some people do, and its corrupting the world and people on it|`|cdRDWS3baa	I'm a christian. (Not a true one) but I guess that's just my opinion on things. I believe in god. there's nothing wrong with it... just like there is nothing with people who don't believe in god. Everybody has their own thing going on.|`|2GW5UDJPaa	Nope.<br>  Religion causes separation, and war throughout the world.<br>  Its a useless concept and it shouldnt exist.|`|7TEwrKJjaa	Im an atheist so from the outside it just seems religion causes conflict and war..|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	i believe people find something in it .not myself ?|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	no
8yE2sYGeaa	Vampires talk in circles.<br>  <br>  the real deal is that Rowling is a better writer tham Meyer|`|8ad6fQiNaa	In term's of actual writing, the Harry Potter series is far better. You can look at the different answers and see why people who like Harry Potter better, do. They actually have a grasp on the english language, while the people who like Twilight think it's "more better".|`|pNy8lakjaa	I found Harry Potter better than Twilight. My reasoning for this is that I found Twilight to be tedious, since it was written from the prospective of a teenager, and it was extremely repetitive. Other than the first one,all the books were rip off of other classic stories, (Romeo and Juliet, A Merchant of Venice, Rosemary's Baby) that Stephanie Meyer herself admitted to ripping off, and not very creative. <br>  <br>  J.K. Rowling created an entirely different world altogether with its own language, sports, animals, and different quirky things. Each book had its own path and were completely original. These stories were friendly for everyone to read, not just teenagers.  Heck it was my 60 year old Aunt who got me into Harry Potter!<br>  <br>  Edit: You knew from the get go that Bella was going to be a Vampire eventually, and with Edward forever. In Harry Potter, JK kept us guessing until the end exactly what was going to happen. BTW, its not gibberish.. its a wonderful language called Latin, you should learn it since majority of the English language is based from it.|`|IGu36Iwwaa	Sorry but Twilight simply made vampires into crying little girls.  They used to be cold calculating lunatics eager to feast on blood.  Now they're sparkly fairy rainbow princesses.  Bah.  Harry Potter could kick the crap out of a Twilight Vampire.  Lestat or Drac would wipe them all out no problem.|`|6D5FlOB3aa	Twilight!<br>  <br>  Although neither are original concepts. I just find Twilight more realistic and more entertaining.|`|1ko8AnvTaa	Just read juscasta's answer! <br>  My thoughts as well|`|viR8Sf01aa	Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  Twilight is directed at teenage readers while Harry Potter can be read by anyone at any age. It's way more enthralling and it's full of surprises. Also the characters are more likeable, I found Bella to be somewhat annoying at times. Twilight is repetitive and I found it kind of childish. Finally, Harry Potter has so much more HUMOUR in it than Twilight.|`|hXSbzBnOaa	Well, twilight is cool but harry potter is better than anyway. From imagination, and their main ideas Harry potter just hit the way. Because I think Twilight is just too simple. Then at last, Bella became the vampire. That's the main ideas. If harry potter, the main ideas is great and creative! That's why I say Harry potter are way better than twilight. Well, yeah..Twilight novel is better but from the main ideas, Harry potter is better.|`|36hPlvRQaa	HP all the way duh! <br>  from what i've seen of twilight it's pretty simplistic and meant for small girls while HP is for everyone and no matter what age still is entertaining and not to mention that it's creative and unique story that made all kids read again..|`|MoEyI2rxaa	I think twilight movie is more better than  harry potter...but harry potter's movies like goblet of fire is kinda interesting,but still think that TWILIGHT is  more better

AA10236380	Counterpoint: a real man NEVER hits his girlfriend/wife/whatever.  Ever.  She can say any vile thing that comes to mind, can get caught with another man, etc.  A real man walks away.<br>  <br>  The only exception is IMMEDIATE self-defense: my girl attacks me with a knife, then I'll do what is necessary to not get hurt, but no more than that.<br>  <br>  If my partner gave me an STD, I'll split with her, call her every name in the book, sue her, etc., but NEVER raise a hand against her.<br>  <br>  Any "man" who hurts a woman is lower than pond scum.<br>  <br>  To be fair and balanced about this, the same goes the other way: a real woman never strikes her man, same reasons.|`|pUMEuCXcaa	First, she doesn't have herpes. Second, you probably can cure anything if you have enough money. Its 20 to 30 years later and Magic Johnson is still kicking it healthy .. HE HAS THE CURE FOR AIDS!<br>  <br>  <br>  On a serious note, Chris Brown beat her ***. She probably pissed him off to the extent where he just snapped because thats what women do, but you never hit them.|`|4w9gmvumaa	I hate to shock you, but celebrities are human.  They do the things that everyone else does, like go poo poo and pick their nose.  Chris Brown allowed his anger and rage to take over.  It does not seem like a logical thing to do as a high  profile person, but it happens.  Look at Ike and Tina Turner.  That's real stuff.  And Chris is going to end up behind bars because this is such a public event.  The nice thing about California is that the prosecutor does not  need Rihanna's permission to prosecute the case.  Based on what we see in the photo, they  have enough evidence to put him away.  He will feel pain in prison.  When the guards turn their head (on purpose) they will let the other inmates get that little punk.  Really, the guards are human too.  <br>  <br>  Don't you  get it?  Hon, there was no herpes.  Chris is a monster.  Sadly, it stems from his  upbringing.  But that's no excuse.  He is responsible for his own actions.  And everyone will learn a valuable lesson through him and his childish behavior.  You see, he is very similar to a sociopath.  Wife-beaters feel no remorse.  They are incapable of being rehabilitated.  I'm just happy that they caught him in time.  Nicole Brown Simpson is smiling down on  RiRi today because the release of the photo has now put everything in the open.  <br>  <br>  The Bible says that what happens in the dark shall come out to light.  There's no way they can go withouth prosecuting this case now.  Chris Breezy is DONE, personally, professionally, DONE.  And I'm glad because, like you said.  RiRi will go on with her life and be successful.  Her album sales are up 35% in one week.  And Chris is  being Boycotted by everyone: radio stations, consumers, endorsements.  <br>  <br>  He was on top of the world, and now he's been taken down, for good.  He is a monster.  And he will likely end up behind bars for the next decade.  And all the teeny bopper fans will learn a valuable lesson.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	im on HULK HOGANS side ...chris the crack head brown is off his face on meths ...or at least he will be by time he get out of jail ...he is such a pretty boy the men in jail are gonna LOVE him =D ...and rhianna im sick of making jokes about her head ..but her head is bigger than a space hopper ...millions of women suffer everyday due to domestic violence and whats done to help them ?? fook all|`|jhNUuz0maa	She didn't deserve to be beaten. Chris Brown should have broken up with her. Chris Brown should have been smart and wore a condom. If anything, Chris is just as at fault as Rihanna was. Who is to say she gave it to him. Maybe he got it from someone else and gave it to her and she found out she had it and told him. <br>  <br>  The short story is, we don't know all the facts. We don't know what they said. We don't know anything. We just know he beat her. It doesn't matter what she did, he still beat her.|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Well.. I see where you're coming from, if she gave him Herpes it would be unfathomably wrong, but so's hitting her and it makes him seem just as bad. We'll have to wait to see what happens, although I doubt this Herpes stuff anyway. If it turns out to be true it's a difficult matter, but she'll probably go on trial too. Chances are Chris wouldn't press charges after what he did, because he wants fans.|`|31mUPnAdaa	you are the FUKCIN man bro!!! AMEN! <br>  <br>  She should get hit again when she gets better just off principle (if what you say is true...)<br>  <br>  Then again,he's not innocent. It takes two. His dumb *** should have known better. Looks like birds of the same feather fly together. Dumb and dumber in my book.|`|de9c0f41ce67fe4bea22e475793add09aa	I knew it had to be something like that, there is no way he would have gotten so angry without a catch|`|nzzAKnp9aa	rihanna deserves alot more than what she got.|`|r5wLhpgqaa	Ok for one how in the shyt do you know she has herpes? How does anyone know, but the ding ding dr? Even if she did give it to him, beating her up, is not the way to get back at her. Suing the behuties off of her, breaking up with her yes, those are ways, but what has been done is done. I sincerely doubt the herpes thing, but i did see pics of her on the channel 5 news this morning. She looks terrible, so no more cover girl contract for her. I also think that they BOTH should have to suffer consequences for their actions and that her music should also be pulled from the radio stations. This is such a shame and I for one am tired of hearing about it and doubly sick of how this country crucifies men before they have the facts of the situation.

That's a great, dramatic concept album, packed with a rollercoaster of emotions and beautifully played music. I also know Pete Trewavas from his work with Transatlantic -- he's a really good bass player.<br>  <br>  So of the three, Marillion is definitely my favorite.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Hey, 80'S MAN!<br>  <br>  Though I'm sure I've heard Marillion and April Wine at some point in my life, nothing is ringing a bell by them.

S5w3fOEEaa	It is really good. The reason is because it isn't just a superhero movie where one is flying and doing things which are almost impossible. The movie has some sense to it. Hats off to the writers for writing a great plot where Batman alone can't do anything, He at times gets a lot of help from Jim Gordon and the Gotham Police Department. And lastly it also showed that humanity is still alive among all of us (the last scene where the joker threatens to blow up both the ships.) Really great. I'd say for a superhero i'd give it 4.9 out of 5. The reason why i'm giving it such high ratings is because i got my money's worth when i walked out of the theatre....|`|tLI94qWNaa	The movie was amazing the first and second time I saw it, but when I tried to watch it again, it just doesn't have the same excitement it had.

And there's not enough demand for someone to transpose pop songs to bagpipes as a commercial venture. Another problem is getting the tunes to actually work with only the nine notes of the bagpipe scale---most pop songs just don't work on a bagpipe. Some work "kind of" and often make the audience grate their teeth over notes that are flat or sharp from what they are expecting.<br>  <br>  Odds are you are going to have to transpose anything you want to play on pipes yourself. It takes a littlee bit of time, but you'll typically figure out within the first five minutes if the tune will sound right on a set of pipes or not. Pick a note to start, figure out if the next note is higher or lower, find it, then figure out if the next note is higher or lower, find it, etc, If the notesdoesn'tt work, then try a different starting note. If you run out of lower notes or higher notes or are missing a middle note, the song is probably just one of the many ones that doesn't work on the pipes.

AA10954273	There was no episode 300 or recap.  They started the season with a party and cast interviews, but they stupidly didn't do much to refresh memories about what had happened before.<br>  <br>  Season 3 has been divided into two volumes:  Villains and Fugitives.  Villains was the first 13 episodes, and Fugitives just started February 2.  Villains was fairly polarizing - people either loved it or hated it.  Personally, I found it a muddled mess.  Characters behaved bizarrely, motivations were unclear, the plot meandered around like a drunk on a bender and there were plot holes big enough to drive a convoy through.  Others thought it was better than season 1, so it really comes down to what you like.  Fugitives was designed to be accessible to new viewers, so you can potentially dive right into it.  I believe they have all of the episodes from this volume so far available at nbc.com and hulu.com.  So far it seems to be a marked improvement.  There are still problems, but it seems to be better.<br>  <br>  You might try checking out the first part of Fugitives on nbc/hulu and see what you think.|`|LvK6rg1caa	I used to watch heros, i stopped when the first or second episoded of the second season aired. I got so lost and still dont get it. Anyways you can find it in season 2.|`|PW7CHeiuaa	season 3 is epic however if you missed some episodes you WILL BE lost, secondly there is no episode 300 the episode that will be aired on 02/23/09 is called "Cold Wars" that will be episode 51. the recap wasn't an episode it was just a recap called "countdown to premiere"<br>  <br>  you can watch the episodes on this site but will have to look somewhere else for the recap.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.casttv.com/shows/heroes" rel="nofollow">http://www.casttv.com/shows/heroes</a><br>           and if they try to charge you.....<br>  <a href="http://toonsurfer.50webs.com/heros.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toonsurfer.50webs.com/heros.htm</a>|`|WNhQzmo3aa	Season three was great...I guess you have to watch seasons one and two to get three...but a lot of questions were answered in three and a lot of questions were asked as well, guess you just have to wait for ....I know I am...|`|ZsZeJOrfaa	Season 3 was really bad. If you liked season 2 though, you might like it. It had plot holes times a billion and ruined everything. Bad, bad, bad. Season 1 was the best.

They're obviously building up the Izzy medical problem and are getting very close to revealing what's wrong with her.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Izzy will die, and Derek HAS to propose SOON, right?|`|41gtr3j7aa	i red this on a site now dunno if its true...<br>  <br>  I have heard (so it's definitely not a confirmed truth) that the whole Denny plot line is that Izzy has a brain aneurism that will soon be detected.<br>  <br>  Until I had heard this I was also wondering where this was going and was beginning to think the writers had lost their minds...but now it makes a little sense.  And I can also understand how everyone is so self-involved that they wouldn't notice Izzy talking to herself.<br>  <br>  I definitely cried.  I love Bailey.  I love the fact that Alex wants to be a better man and does in fact feel like a better man because of Izzy.  I find the Callie and new intern situation very funny.  It is interesting to see Callie trying to figure out her new self.  All in all a good show...can't wait until next week!!!|`|Nhje1U06aa	I think Izzy has cancer!   Not sure if she's leaving .There are so many rumors<br>  Bailey did look nice!<br>  Derrick better propose , but I think he will be f***ed up after the patient that died.. Merideth seemed different these past 3 episodes- Not sure whats up , but something is brewing<br>  Callie will hook up with the peds dr. <br>  I am thinking sloan and lil grey are gonna move in together!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think Izzy going to get sick. &  I agree with the other guy i like Bailey's hairdo.
8yE2sYGeaa	Stylized, especially in manga, when they can slip into chibi|`|qPBsbsMSaa	wat do you mean by "stylized" as in like anime and manga? well, if thats the case, then id prefer stylized better, considering that im really into realistic drawing, but its only for like drawing, if it was realistic for comics like Superman or something, than thats not my type of realism.|`|tkSll6Gtaa	stylized because realistic is cheesy unless they put a lot of time into it which most companies don't

lOXqBBOwaa	Yes, Some psychics exist to some point.|`|50dfad07d8ee2b10b7bb6c48c0f62037aa	True psychics are not what Hollywood portrays them to be; telepathic, able to move things with the mind, prophetic visions.<br>  <br>  They are a tad dull in real life.<br>  <br>  True psychics are just people who are very observant of their surroundings and with good instincts. Having those two traits, they can easily make good judgment on things and even predict the order in which they happen. <br>  <br>  People mistake that for clairvoyance or omniscience but it is merely someone's ability to see things clearly and as the way they are.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	I believe there are some with genuine ability,yes.The trick is to weed out the real ones from the charlatans.There's alot o people who claim to be psychic cuz they want to steal your money.Gotta be careful.There is one I read about,Edgar Cayce,in all respects appeared to be very gifted.Look up his name(he's deceased)and see what you find.He was accurately able to diagnose people's illnesses and he had no medical training whatsoever.Quite fascinating.You can develop your own abilities if you really wanted to.One good book I got years ago is called:You are psychic by Pete A. Sanders.See if you can find it.It's a paperback and only cost like $12.95.From all I've read over the years,you have to quiet your mind in order for psychic events to happen.The chattery wide awake mind gets in the way they say.I don't claim to be psychic,I'm an average person,yet I have had psychic experiences,sometimes scary,sometimes fascinating.Trouble is,very few people would believe it cuz there's so many people who are fakes just to earn a buck.The times when I had the most visions and clairaudient experiences is when I was in love.I heard it was from the heightened emotional state.It was really cool actually.No,I'm not making that up or having fantasies,it was totally seperate from that.But if that happens,you can't tell people cuz they get scared of you if what you tell them you "heard" or "saw" is actually true.I found that out the hard way.So in answer to your question,yes,psychic ability is real just watch out for the fakes.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Yes, there are psychic. Each has different abilitys, do you ever watch the show Medium? That is a show about a psychic woman.|`|p0NnFB7Daa	HHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL NO!|`|3WItFAwlaa	Yes.  Psychics exist.  <br>  <br>  Most people are psychic to some degree.  It is important not to abuse one's gifts.  That is why Sylvia Brown is a joke now.  Her ego got in her way.  <br>  <br>  There used to be a few good psychics around here... Pan, Sadhara, and Miss Zoe.  But they left for various reasons.  Now we are left with egomaniacs who practice no discretion when answering questions encouraging young girls to become dependant on them.  Any good psychic will tell you that it is important for each of us to trust our own inner knowing... that part of us that is connected to God. They don't need groupies.  And they do not need to gossip about others.  They are not threatened by the abilities of others. <br>  <br>  Yes, there are psychics but not on Yahoo Answers. At least not any with intergrity... anymore.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Not one person has ever proved any type of psychic ability. There is a million dollars waiting for the first person to do so. When this is done then it is possible.<br>  "Psychics" should put their mouth where the money is.<br>  <br>  What qualifies a psychic? Are they better than random chance? It's seems that all one has to do is simply say they are. No evidence is required and any "real" psychic will never subject themselves to strict tests. Their "word' is good enough for many here. Self deception is never a possibility. Saying that everyone is a little psychic holds no water and is plain silly to say. Belief is the key again, not facts.

tgYEXN8Gaa	I think it's quite likely to be true, although we can't be 100% sure unless he actually comes to the media and says it himself.  Jay-Z seems like a decent man, I mean, he has been with Beyonce for ages and you don't hear about his inappropriate behavior or crazy arguments or anything, so it is probably likely he is enraged by this incident, in particular to Rihanna, whom it looks like he is friends with.  I don't think he is literally going to do anything to Chris Brown though, he doesn't seem to be moronically stupid.|`|houWY7qvaa	Jay Z is full of himself.  He thinks he's the black mafia or something.  You would think after Bigee and Tupac they would quit playing the gangsta roles.  It's tired and not impressive, especially since he is not above the law.  It's not respectful to his fans who think highly of him either, and what message is he sending?|`|MV6pc1omaa	Depending on the municipal code, that could result in felony threat charges. Jay Z knows better.|`|AA11196136	It's random, you can never tell if its true.  People can make up anything|`|k8hwwxqKaa	his just defending his friend Rihanna
uMWpBvxraa	Most rappers grew up in areas where smoking weed and selling drugs happened every day.Also it makes them look cool and show that they also break the law which refers to most american youths.|`|SpcYCBndaa	can you say:<br>  macho macho man!<br>  <br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Because it looks so cool|`|nWjnuYDUaa	Because, people who listen to that usually smoke weed, so they are relating. That's why quite often you see smoke, but don't see where it's eminating from.|`|qRTJc9yJaa	its all about business|`|sTwTXixXaa	For their image, they want to look cool.|`|UX2dqQQVaa	Appearance.....<br>  <br>  To try to make them look bad @ss...I dunno

capSLZQXaa	Q1- Because in the Christian world, it's pretty much accepted that if you are accused of killing your girlfriend, and die from a drug overdose, that you will end up in hell.<br>  <br>  Q2-When Malcolm McClaren put the Sex Pistols together(in boy-band fashion), part of the band's "packaging" was to wear the "punk look" clothing from Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die(Malcolm and Vivienne Westwood's clothing store). Wearing a shirt with a swastika on it was thought to be extremely rebellious, and even today evokes a lot of emotion from people that see a shirt like this. It was all for attention, because that's what McClaren's idea of punk rock was all about. Everything the Pistols did was preplanned(except their break-up).|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Because he was evil.|`|bm289GOuaa	He appears in Hell in the video 'cause if he appeared in Heaven in a video it would offend right-wing Christian fanatics so much they'd have to stab 1000 homosexuals in order to vent their rage (jk -- I have no idea why).<br>  As for the Nazi thing, eh, that was kinda common in punk. In fact, in all seriousness, I believe it had something to do with some of the early punks' parents being Jewish victims of the Nazis. It was like a rebellion against that..... Kind of like how some blacks have adopted "n*gga" to empower themselves. Well some young Jewish punks adopted the Nazi swastika to empower themselves, and then it spread to non-Jewish punks. It's really just an anti-establishment thing at the end of the day though. I don't think he was a big racist or anything. No way. I mean, he was a friend of John Lydon ("Johnny Rotten"), and Lydon's no racist 'cause he's worked with black musicians, you know......|`|t1zhVVfBaa	Because by being contraversial and doing the opposite of what you are supposed to do you can make alot of money and get alot of girls.|`|APNLYQgoaa	He has always been a bad bad boy.
gJhwH335aa	When Luffy almost got his head chopped off by buggy the clown and a lightning strike which saved Luffy. Do you think his father did that or it was pure luck?<br>  <br>  - That one is one of the infamous Myth in One Piece. Most people claimed Dragon has the Devil Fruit ability to control weather but so far, Oda has not revealed Dragon's ability to us yet.<br>  <br>  Read here<br>  <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Mythbusters#The_Devil_Fruit_eaten_by_Dragon" rel="nofollow">http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Mythbuste...</a><br>  <br>  were you surprised when you found out that Luffy's family were so powerful?<br>  <br>  - Kind of. I usually not into a main character with powerful background / family tree though. It usually killed the fun or destroyed the character development but Luffy is a special case. His father, Dragon is revolutionist, wanted to destroyed the World Government, his grandfather, Garp works under World Government and most people / civilian see WG as justice, while Luffy is a rebellious pirates. He do anything as he pleased. I think I'm starting to enjoy this family conflict. ^__^<br>  <br>  The middle name D. Do you think they are all related some how?<br>  <br>  - Its called a will of D. It has never been explained yet in the series. So far, Oda has introduce several characters with a Will of D. <br>  - Gol D. Roger<br>  - Monkey D. Luffy <br>  - Portgas D. Ace <br>  - Marshall D. Teach a.k.a Blackbeard<br>  - Monkey D. Dragon<br>  - Monkey D. Garp <br>  - Jaguar D. Saul <br>  <br>  Read here<br>  <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/D" rel="nofollow">http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/D</a><br>  <br>  You should read that Mythbusters though (refer the first link) because two out of three Q's you asked here are the most talked about and speculate by One Piece fans. <br>  <br>  My opinion is simple, lets just wait for Oda sensei explained every thing later. He is not the type of person that does everything randomly. He has a reason for each of his drawing. Who would have thought Laboon arc back then is connected with Thriller Bark arc right? As of right now, I'm more interested on finding out about the clue / hint he left us about Skypiea<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsqKkiW10CXz1MxyXXPW5aDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208185455AA0GvY4&show=7#profile-info-bZsF1n0zaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  After all, the series is still half way done. I'm looking forward for Oda to unveil the mystery of his series. Right now, we are gathering pieces by pieces waiting to be organized and completed to form One - Master - Piece.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I think Luffy's father caused the lightning strike. It can't be a pure coincidence because that tower is not the tallest. We have seen how his father's power works kinda though. We've seen the huge gust of wind taking the Strawhats away to the shore.<br>  <br>  PS: Yes, I was very surprised. It makes me wonder about Luffy's mom and grandma though. :)<br>  <br>  The D. letter middle name doesn't really have a connection with everyone. I think it means how powerful of the D. middle name person are. For example: Gol D. Roger, Portgas D. Ace, Monkey D. Luffy, and the rest all seem to share dream-believe thing. I can't really say since they were all nice, kind, and they just do what they want.|`|gF4tq7NDaa	seriously there is no way to tell however i want to say his father saved him with that lightning strike (>_<) then maybe he has some weather power or something like that. but it would make sense if he had some devil fruit power because he has the highest bounty in the world of one piece :)<br>  <br>  i was not too shocked because i was lmao @ the marines faces once garp said that lol, but it was kind of weird that garp tried to make luffy into a marine as a child O_o<br>  <br>  probably but i think they are all related do to the will of d or something like that. i was reading about it sometime in the past. <br>  <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Will_of_the_D." rel="nofollow">http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Will_of_t...</a><br>  <br>  *sips tea*

I do not like pomp and circumstance and such gatherings are a means of getting everyone involved together again. Shucks, they probably don't know each other outside the movie projects they completed.

KSC02NcLaa	End of the 177-178 Double Episode. But we don't get to see the match.  They just have a Screen saying, Lleyton Hewitt vs. Echizen Ryoma, You see Echizen serve and then, the announcer says, "Game and Match, won by Echizen." That's It.

rvGaryaCaa	Hed PE's one of my favorite bands.  Honestly, they don't have one set genre in my opinion.  For example, in the song "Blackout", I'd consider that more of a rock-based song.  In the song say... "Amerikan Beauty", that's more rap-based.  Thennn, maybe if you were to take the song "Sophia", it sounds mostly like a reggae type thing (until of course, you get to the chorus where it speeds up).|`|n9bcCsZbaa	It's like trip-hop rock|`|V3u2R0Tpaa	I think they're soft.

AA11654248	Clare: In what way is she an inspiration ?  Fame through ignorance and bullying, having no understanding of the concept of dignity.  She's low-life with no talent, and although I wouldn't wish cancer on her, she won't be missed.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	I sort of agree with you, but having said that she will be dead in a couple of weeks poor girl, she is only 27. If she is raising awarenes sit is only a good thing. Personally i count my blessings everytime i see her, i'm only a few years older and get down about silly things like weight, money worries etc, then i think she really has problems, so count your blessings and don't be so nasty!|`|XOx8MYxuaa	Mmmmm!<br>  <br>  She says that (now shes' dying) she wants to give her kids a good education!<br>  <br>  Odd! She never thought of that before. All the money she has made since BB. What did she spend that on?|`|AA11904226	If all the coverage saves one family from future grief it's worth it|`|WEndgCQyaa	i dont think its gettin blown out of proportion. Shes trying to make as much money now to leave her kids so they'll have a good life. Its a terrible thing to happen and shes an inspiration the way shes handled it all.<br>  Tooniron.....she is not a lowlife. She didnt no that womans name. Seems like u cant say n e thing these days without it being racist. I don't see u sticking out a career in the public eye. At the mo shes thinking of her children and i completely respect her 4 that, and 4 u 2 say she wont b missed means u are cold hearted and abit of a knob if i'm honest.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	its probably a good thing its getting so much coverage because it might encourage other women to get more knowledgeable about cancer.

uxYYJQLPaa	i know, apparently they have another plans, i think<br>  there have been alot of changes since last year, like kara as new judge<br>  its been rumoured that there will be no "idol gives back" this year<br>  i dont know what theyre up to, but i do notice too that there are alot of differences since last year<br>  but the top 36 week hasnt finished yet, they still have 2 other groups to complete the top 12 joining michael, alexis, and danny<br>  <br>  and its also been rumoured that they are going to end american idol season 8 in april, i think they have something's going on|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	not really. THey still have two more weeks of "groups of 12" yet, and then they'll only eliminate one per week after they get the "actual" top 12.|`|Ii8oMAmfaa	its not short they only have three in the top 12 so it aint that bad.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	Yes,my husband just said the same thing! Everything just seems to be moving so fast this season!|`|RVABrMeSaa	There are two more sets of twelve have not aired. nowhere near the top 12 yet.

gJhwH335aa	You are into psychological, mystery, with some sorta supernatural kinda stuff eh? Here's my recommendation.<br>  <br>  1. Liar Game<br>  - They don't have that supernatural element because they're revolved in the real world. However, the main character is like a mixture between L's weird personality with Light's perfectionist personality. It's about a con artist that got into a game called Liar Game (duh...). I really like the psychological stuff in the series. Liar personnel vs Liar Organization.<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Liar_Game/1/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Liar_Game/1/01/</a><br>  - They don't have anime for this but they have a live action J-drama.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_game" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_game</a><br>  <br>  2. Monster<br>  - Again, they don't really have that supernatural element. They're more into a detective chasing a criminal kinda stuff. Its about a doctor named Dr. Kenzo Tenma, hunting down a psychopath/sociopath. The same stuff like Death Note 'cat and mouse' 'hide and seek' kinda game. I really enjoy the plot twist on this series. I personally like this series better than DN (probably because I'm biased towards Seinen series)<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Monster/1/01/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Monster/1/01/</a><br>  - There's anime for this one and they really stay true with the manga plot<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(anime)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(an...</a><br>  <br>  3. Mushishi<br>  - This one have that detective + supernatural element. Its about a detective that has the knowledge and skill to save people that has been plagued by Mushi - some sort of super natural beings in this series. Its not really as close as Death Note to be honest but its really worth the read.<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Mushishi/1/00/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Mushishi/1/00/</a><br>  - There's also anime for this one<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi</a><br>  <br>  5. MPD Psycho<br>  - The name speak for itself. This is about a detective with a multiple personality disorder. It has sickening stuff and twisted plot. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpd_psycho" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpd_psycho</a><br>  - No anime for the series but they has been adapted into a short TV series.<br>  <br>  6. Funeral Procession of K<br>  - Quite an unorthodox art style I must say. Its like Frank Miller drawing manga if you know what I mean (used of black, white and red). I'm not that far yet into this series but its been really good (and confusing) so far. Not recommended if you are into a series with appealing art style.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Procession_of_K" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Pro...</a><br>  <br>  7. Lost Brain<br>  - This is probably the closest you can get to Death Note.<br>  Almost everything looks exactly like Death Note. Character design? Checked! Plot? Kinda the same, so checked! However, as you continue the reading process, it slowly moved away from being DN copycat. Can't comment more because I'm still new on this series.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost%2BBrain" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost%2BBrai...</a><br>  - No anime for the series yet (because its still new)|`|fe2f81588ecd4cf84508234a973e6b23aa	^^those are nothing like Death Note^^<br>  <br>  Death Note is a shonen, but it's leaning very close towards the seinen genre. I think you should explore the seinen genre. <br>  <br>  20th Century Boys <br>  Monster<br>  <br>  are pretty close to Death Note in the eerie attitude. Oh btw...make sure you're old enough...say 15 up.|`|3rOoXmTEaa	Try Witch hunter its a really good manga<br>  <br>  If you wanna read it try www.onemanga.com<br>  <br>  Hope you like it|`|uK3erCEOaa	Pokemon...|`|IYN9Ceq5aa	yuyu hakashow and inu yasha|`|6zRPgbn7aa	Reborn!<br>  Deadman Wonderland<br>  Bakuman [no not the show, the manga created by the Death Note people]<br>  you can read those on onemanga.com|`|8yE2sYGeaa	NOTHING is really close to death note

8yE2sYGeaa	The castle comes from Mad Prince Ludwig of bavaria|`|220b497f9a511b5df0fff475b46096ffaa	Cinderella Castle was inspired by several French castles, most notably Chateau de Pierrefonds, Chateau d'Ussé in France, Fontainebleau, Versailles, and the chateaux of Chenonceau, Chateau de Chambord, Chaumont, and the Alcázar in Segovia, Spain. Neuschwanstein Castle was the original inspiration for Walt Disney in his concept for the castle in the classic animated feature Cinderella.

6NZeItMAaa	Why do you want to become a Pisces? Worry, anxiety, and diseased imagina-tion are the most formidable faults of this sign.<br>  Some of these people beat their hearts out with imagining fears, and are con-stantly expecting accidents and unpleas-ant tidings. This anxiety makes them prematurely old. Many an active and earnest business man has taken his own life because of his gloomy forebodings of failure, and afterward those fears were found to have been groundless. Pisces men, probably on account of their train-ing and education, are more careful and methodical  in  their  daily  habits  than Pisces women, although just as restless.<br>  <br>  Taurus people  are fearless and kind, and very magnanimous when not irri-tated. They are generous, and apt to load themselves with the burdens and sorrows of others. Money has no special value in their minds except for the good it will do. They have no wish to hoard, and are always ready to divide. They prefer to help with money rather than by the expenditure of time or sympathy. They have great power of concentration, and make the best metaphysical healers.<br>  <br>  By the power of their will they can pro-ject their thought to great distances and hit the mark. They are exceedingly fond of the good things of the earth, and like to spread feasts for their friends.<br>  These Taurus individuals are guided far too much by externalities and appear-ances. The whole physical nature seems to grow out of the five animal senses, but when developed above the sensual appe-tites they are most powerful mentally and spiritually, making apt writers, and quick, brilliant speakers; in fact, they are very zealous and sanguine in any line of thought they may take up.<br>  <br>  Knowing your faults will permit you to be a better person. Emphasize your good side and do not let the bad come over. The motto of the astrology is "blessed who overcome"|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Well if you don't dwell on the negative then you have nothing worry about. This is when using astrology to your advantage comes into play. Having your sun in Taurus gives you an a large amount of qualities both negative and positive, but you're not all the negative nor are you all the positive. You already see that you have other influence in your chart. You have a Cancer rising, well Cancers can be greedy too, and Aries have a me first attitude, so you can't chalk it up all on Taurus. You should get your complete chart done, you see a negative then work on it so you won't be that way. It will make you a better person.|`|hQmj5SChaa	wait, you base how you are on what sign you are?????????????<br>  <br>  So if I tell you that you must act intelligent and not listen to this stupid crap, you'd have to follow right?|`|bi4zsE6Uaa	i dont think the zodiac is true|`|3PBlpQFTaa	Hey, I can convince you! Sounds to me like you should be Cancer instead of Pisces, and apparently you already are! Cancer are all that, well, except for the peace, lol!<br>  I don't like Tauruses myself but trust me, you decide what you want to be, although you may find you already have a little of what you so like, I adore Leos to death and recently found out I have some Leo in myself, I also have some Cancer and used to hate it, now I love it.<br>  What I'm saying is you have that perception for something in yourself, but in the end it's you who chooses which part to embrace, my advice: just let it flow.<br>  Good luck|`|hOGAgVASaa	well pisces and cancer are almost the same lol,<br>  alot of the same quality's ,..cancer is your rising sign so everybody sees you as nice emotional ect,  i went through a fae where i wanted to be a cancer i got over it though, ..you have to look at the good in taurus, there supposed to be most beautiful, popular, ect, not all the zodiac signs have the good and bad, im a scorpio but im not jealous person , it depends on the rest of your chart, if you have mars it gemini or cancer or w.e it might be will change a person alot!<br>  i have mars in Sagittarius which helps me (scorpio) to be more friendly o my moon sign which is in aquarius, that would make me nicer than the typical scorpio, just put some thought into what i said,<br>  theres alot more good then there is bad|`|GNxhkuXIaa	I think the problem lies not so much in what your zodiac sign is, but in the fact that you actually believe all this zodiac crap.  That's a far greater personality flaw than any purported by some crafty person who thought it would be clever to base people's personalities and lifestyles on what time of the year they were born.|`|Pf0YUxWFaa	I would just round up all the Pisces and shoot them.

fI4LqMVMaa	I really liked it, and I don't think it's a rip off of high school musical. I do believe it is nick's response to high school musical and its fame, but to say it's a rip off implies that Spectacular took things (including most notably the plot) from HSM and that is just not true.<br>  <br>  hsm - kids afarid of what other kids would think of them if they loved something else and didn't "stick to the status quo" <br>  <br>  Spectacular- Acutally is about a group compteing in a song and dance competition and showing off their talent.<br>  <br>  See? Different plot lines. If you're going to claim that spectacular is a rip off of HSM, then HSM is definatly a rip off of Greese.<br>  <br>  The only things they share are that they are musicals (which many movies nowadays are), they are set in high school (not uncommon in movies) that there is some sort of competition (a common conflict in movies) and that there is love between the titular characters (again, common in most movies)<br>  <br>  As I was just saying in another question under this topic:<br>  I don't think it's a copy because they have totally different plotllines, and the characters have totally different goals. Troy doesn't want anyone to know he likes music at first, whereas Nikko loves music and has always made that clear. I just saw spectacular, and I loved it. I'm bummed out though because I missed the begining. From what I saw though, it's equally as good as if not better then HSM, and I'm going to buy it when it comes out on DVD. The songs are great, I just bought three on itunes. I would have bought the whole soundtrack, but I ran out of money. Really, the music is fantastic. The songs really make you happy, they make you want to sing and dance.<br>  <br>  Additionally, nolan gerard funk is really really cute, I totally agree with you on that! :D<br>  Hope I helped, <br>  ~Clarkie|`|Ma0EBmY0aa	i don't like any of them.|`|nYF1CNvYaa	Yea it was a good movie, not like that high school musical pop crap stuff. There was rock and was actually realistic unlike hsm where they just burst into dancing. So i actually thought it was really good, and before i saw it i thought it was going to be bad, guess i was wrong.|`|rS2C5Xp6aa	well i dont know cause i was watching fred on icarly thats pretty funny :P

EI3T4nMSaa	Birthday Report  for born on the day of Thursday, 01-28-1982 <br>  <br>  Your Sun Sign is Aquarius<br>   Aquarius ruled by Uranus. They are the most unconventional, unique and independent of the Air Signs. They are fair, intelligent, objective, creativity and often let their head rule rather than heart. Aquarians never care about what has been done in the past because they are totally dreaming and planning on the future. <br>  <br>  Your Birth Tree is Cypress<br>  Strong, muscular, adaptable, takes what life has to give, happy, content, optimistic, craves money and acknowledgement, hates loneliness, passionate lover which cannot be satisfied, faithful, quick tempered, unruly, pedantic and careless. <br>  <br>  Your Birth Stone is Garnet<br>  Garnets come in a variety of colors including purple, red, orange, yellow, green, brown, black, or colorless. <br>  <br>  Your Life Path Number is Four<br>  FOUR will be marked by hard working, loyal, devoted and dependable. It produces the most trustworthy, practical, and down-to-earth of individuals.|`|6NZeItMAaa	People born under this sign are said to be the strongest and the weakest people in the world. They are naturally endowed with great possibilities, which, when understood and appreciated, take them to supreme heights of strength and usefulness, and when ignored or unrecog-nized, cause them to be creatures of impulse and fluctuating desire, positively without equilibrium and blown about by every wind of doctrine.<br>  <br>   In the latter state they are those who constantly seek advice on the simplest subjects, and rarely ever take it; who ask questions with great humility and forget the an-swers. These persons are aware of pos-sessing unusual power in certain direc-tions, but they are so lazy and so deficient in the ability to concentrate, that these beautiful gifts are scattered and very fre-quently entirely lost.<br>  <br>  Aquarius people are remarkable spirit-ual healers. Every human being born under this sign possesses this genius, whether he is aware of it or not, and it can be brought into a beautiful and phenomenal use by a respectful and loving recognition. To learn to know opportunity and improve it, is the key to Aquarius genius.<br>  <br>  The Aquarius women are not so timid and so apprehensive of danger to those they love as Libra women, or so restless and fidgety as Gemini women, but they usually care more for the acquisition of property than these people, and are apt to be very nervous about their invest-ments, the management of business, and the opinion and speech of people.<br>  <br>  Those born under this sign are gener-ally very noble, honest, and kind-hearted, and are endowed with considerable natu-ral discrimination. They are fair readers of character, and are not easily deceived by a pitiful tale. This mental and spiritual quickness makes them very apt in any study, any trade, or profession they may take up. It is hardly too much to say that Aquarius men and women who are even partially aware of their power, can succeed in almost any work they may decide to do.  <br>  <br>    They are not rote students, but seem without any par-ticular effort to absorb information from every source. They are always agreeable and retain their dignity on all occasions. They are rarely passionate or quick-tempered, but know how to resent an insult when one is offered.<br>  <br>  The Air people are sometimes un-manageable and not always logical, but they have a comprehension of spiritual cause and effect which is entirely above ordinary material syllogistic reasoning. This power the Aquarius people pos-sess to a remarkable degree, which is the power of inspiration and divination. It is called the Power of the Holy Ghost. When the soul of an Aquarius person is once roused to work for righteousness, improvement is sure to be rapid, and a high spiritual development follows.<br>  <br>  All born under this sign have a gift of the spirit which, if they choose to recog-nize and use, is wonderful indeed. It is the magical ability of controlling insane people. When this fact is generally, as it is privately and scientifically recog-nized, nurses and guardians of these afflicted people will be chosen from those born under this sign, and they will be carefully trained for the work.<br>  <br>  The eyes of the silent, quiet, Aquarius person have great hypnotic force, and when the light that shines forth is the light of the Spirit, the ability to heal seems almost superhuman.|`|c4GykfVkaa	Aquarius<br>  <br>  Individuals born on the 28th of January are so intensely self motivated they often respond poorly to other people's rules and frequently do not make strong team players. On the plus side, they are hearty adventurous types who  <br>  are brimming with unbridled enthusiasm. In addition to having a tremendous reserve of physical and mental energy, <br>  they also have a resolute attitude and an upbeat, positive outlook on life in general. They want the best for everyone, and they are prepared to do something about it. Unlike some people born under the Aquarius sign, they do not enjoy watching life from a distance. When they feel they are being called to defend a cause worth fighting for, they are the first to suit up for battle, and they tend to come out swinging.

Quando sono uscito con il salvataggio impressionabile (1980), praticamente hanno saltato lo squalo. Lo hanno reso ad un ritorno con il tatuaggio (1981) ma dovrebbero concluderli su un'alta nota. Da allora, si sono trasformati in in una caricatura di se stesso. La odio quando i gruppi gradicono le pietre, che, Aerosmith e rifiuti U2 per appenderli in su e da trasformarsi in in uno scherzo.

AA12381582	The fact that they are polarized 3d, with the tinted sunglasses type, is nothing really new.  The movies of the 3d boom of the 1950's where polarized, not red and blue.  Jaws 3d in 1983 was polarized.  From reading different articles it sounds like one reason is because it is much easier for studios to film in 3d because of digital cameras as oppossed to film cameras.  Now they can replay the scene on demand and if the 3d effect doesn't look quite right they can refilm and change things around or even change it with a computer without refilming.   Also when they released some films in 3d in just a few theaters like chicken little and polar express and beowulf the attendance to the 3d showing was reather impressive compared to the 2d showing.  So then the studios realized that at least for now there are a lot of people willing to see and pay a little more for the 3d.  Even now the last two 3d films (My Bloody Valentine and Coraline) for every one person that saw it in 2d six saw it in 3d, and remember way more theaters are showing the 2d version.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Probably this technology: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_D_Cinema" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_D_Cine...</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't use the traditional red/blue glasses.|`|0947e3ec7f569b16160b4d118918524baa	In addition to the development of digital 3-D, studios are looking to give audiences an experience that they can't get at home.  So many people choose to wait until a movie comes out on video or cable instead of actually going to the theater there needs to be a very compelling reason to see a film on the big screen for some people.  The next thing coming is live events transmitted in 3-D to theaters - the NBA has done a few tests which have been really well received, it's just all about how to make it reasonably affordable for theaters to get the equipment.

The Hip hop scene became hugely popular when Tupac and Biggies feud started. They were the two main rappers at the time .... nowadays we got so many rappers. We cant judge present day west coast rappers and east coast rappers because there are too many .  So you have to base your answer on hip hop 12 years ago. Westcoast vs. Eastcoast = Tupac vs. Biggie. Neither of them two rappers won the feud coz they both ended up dying. So there really isnt one clear winner...So west coat and east coast are on the same level thus both of them being equal.

zdlLVB1Kaa	As a steakhouse chef, Giovanni should have totally rocked the grill station.  If he can't do well what he should be doing on a regular basis, I can't imagine he'll do well under other circumstances.  He should have gone.  Or Ramsay should have decided that the women's team lost and gotten rid of Lacey or Colleen.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes I do.  I thought Giovanni failed miserably|`|gIjnoEi5aa	DEFINITELY!  Yes, Charlie screwed up a little, but Seth made a complete fool of himself trying to cut that fillet.  He's useless in the kitchen and is somewhat gooberish-looking.  He should have been the one who went home.  I also agree with La in that I wouldn't have minded it if the women had lost the dinner service because then they would have been able to get rid of some "dead weight."  I really don't understand why Colleen is still on the show.  She's completely incompetent in the kitchen and I agree with Chef in that she's robbing people by charging $300 to participate in her cooking school.  Her performance on the show is not measuring up to her resume.|`|f9Un06Bwaa	I agree that Giovanni should have let himself be nominated for elimination last night. I think he knew if he did he would be gone. But honestly Seth is not to far either. He was purposely sending food back on the girls side to keep them from winning. That is just lower than low and a first that I've ever seen on Hell's Kitchen.

fe2f81588ecd4cf84508234a973e6b23aa	On all the way. Otherwise you don't get the full effect of the movie.<br>  Sure, you don't understand the language, but you do get the tone of voice, etc. They compliment the movie very well, adds warmth, and richness. Don't turn it off =P|`|PcSxOrcvaa	LOL YES!!!!!!! I was watching a Chinese movie with the guy from "the one" I actually raised the volume and realized... I wasn't going to understand them. lol|`|tLI94qWNaa	I have the sound on always, I cant stand silence when watching a movie, even if it is a foreign one. It doesn't make much sense to me if you are watching a movie to have the sound off.  If there is other noises where I cant hear the movie, I will get my head phones and plug them in.  I love to hear how they speak, it is so beautiful and so wonderful.|`|i8FtcBWgaa	I own Pan's Labyrinth and it's in Spanish and the subtitles are English but I keep the sound on because you get the feeling of the characters by their tone of voice.|`|28c824fbc811c81ae8187771254d03f2aa	Where I live there are sub-titles are on everything..news, docu's, soaps, movies, reality etc itsa dual-language area. There is some point that it does make sense to read everything and see the movie as it is or just as you would with a home based one..albeit without  subtitles. <br>  However, personally speaking, (am english speaker by the way) strange things begin to appear to happen after switching over..that is..your eyes keep looking down at the bottom of the screen to read..yet end up looking at the crotch-area of some person on the screen..male or female, it's annoying to stop your eyes looking at the empty spaces. I try to avoid films with sub-titles...and though if there is one or two then my eyes are automatically trained to read what is there and it becomes second nature..I do not believe by turning off the sound makes the film more enjoyable..I think without sounds I would not be interested at all in the film let alone the subject matter.|`|HkSSJXE9aa	lol all the time specially if it's a movie i'm into but i do it cuz i wanna hear everything and sometimes if i can't make out what they say in words i can tell by the way they talk, the way they sound and everything i like to hear everything...|`|C4miEeuYaa	Definetly on. Like the guy above said, you need to get the full effect of the movie.|`|yPf96Vvfaa	no I think the sound's important. really helps me understand the mood and tone of the characters.

My supervisor isn't doing anything about it and doesn't realize how much it affects everyone in the room because the stinky lady is her own little brown noser. I tried saying something to my supervisor but she just says I'm making too big of a deal about it even though the lady stinks so bad it makes me choke and I can't get my work done.<br>  <br>  I think she likes bothering other people....otherwise why else would anyone purposely leave the house smelling like that?|`|0WKkXIyKaa	eurgh i hate it too.<br>  <br>  they don't realise it most of the time.|`|nO2vflnPaa	Some just dont care.

KFgrvcSYaa	Yes, it's a pretty simple idea but it takes awhile to master. It is done by alternating and moving your jaw from its normal position when you are singing. This creates different pressure gradients in your trachea/vocal cords by changing the diameter(size) which changes the amount and force of air moving through your throat. This will allow the "bend" to be more prevalent. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!<br>  <br>  p.s. focus on trying to constrict and then dilate your airway as you sing!|`|btEUXC62aa	oooooo|`|mAjyNjV5aa	All youur questions will be answered in this link below hope it helps you as it did for me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Singing-Style-www-borntosingmusic-com/dp/B0018JJ1RU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235144687&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Sin...</a>|`|pian616Daa	Wow, you must sound good.

I won't do that, but I will tell you this, do your research and tell her to do the same, anti depressants do absolutely nothing for you, they mask symptoms and never solve the root problem, that's the basic ugly truth about them, that doctors won't tell you, and that pharma companies don't want you to know. I really hope you take this answer seriously, because I'm speaking from experience, and I've spoken with a lot of other people who have found out and eventually saw through the bullsh*t.|`|F7jOVyeqaa	The answer is not to take anti-depressants. If you read the small type of side effects carefully you will be shocked. <br>  <br>  Truth is that there is no such a thing as a side effect. They are simply effects. They happen and any anti depressant out there today is worse than taking street drugs.

AqXadhUzaa	A picture speaks a thousand words, and this photo says everything. To me, she almost looks dead. Even though her eyes are closed, you can sense how upset she is. It disturbs me to be honest.<br>  <br>  I hope Chris Brown gets arrested and gets the highest amount of punishment there is for this. We must forget that these are celebrities and remember they are real people. If my Father did that to my Mother Im pretty sure he would be sent to prison. <br>  <br>  Chris Brown is a scumbag for doing that.

There are a lot of sick people out there who hate Rihanna because of her beauty and fame. THese same people are in denial about Chris Brown because they love/lust after him and imagine themselves being his woman. Fantasy. Anyone who defends Brown after this is sickening. He pummeled this woman brutually. He is an animal. I am so sick of people defending this attack. They are so lowdown that they make up sick rumors about Rihanna having a venereal disease and giving it to Brown. THese rumors have become justification in some peoples minds about the attack. I really think we have a lot of ignorant, uneducated people out there who are really limited in their ghetto mentality. It's really sad because they are the future of this country. My advice to them is go to college and take some classes such as psychology, English and womens studies.|`|f9yORGumaa	How can anyone buy into that lovey dovey kiss kiss crap now that they know what he does?

KXs7Q4Xnaa	When a scorpio loves someone it's whether 100% or nothing. So I'm thinking that if he were really in love with u he would definitely go for it! <br>  I think he just doesn't want to hurt your feelings because he's attached to you in a friendly way and doesn't want to loose the friendship you and he share, because as you know scorpios and capricorns can become very close friends, and he doesn't want to let go of that.<br>  As far as your obesity goes, you shouldn't worry about that because that's just who you are and if that's the reason why he doesn't want to be in a relationship with u, then he isn't worth being with u.|`|cuIX13BKaa	Hi....Virgo here. Love your question as it tugs at a familiar situation for myself...however Two Scorpios before me have answered quite honestly. I couldn't beat that if I tried. I applaud your Scorpio friend's honesty and yours as well for their different reasons. To be honest I have literally save a couple of weeks intermittently, always had someone in my life and I don't right now....it is MY choice. I have a few small repairs to make. I am not though have always been in a relationship~yes I want a break....I don't want editorials or the getting to know you dance.....which of course I realize is different from what you are stating.....If you think it is your weight, it may be....that is somethng that hit me thru illness and seems a part...now mind you I am just being honest......of my decision as so many people look at 'overweight' as slothful or lacking in discipline.....au contaire I say......but primarily the reason I want to go this short bit alone....is that I need to heal a  bit. No details are necessary and no it was not a relationship that made me feel this way. I am prioritizing....and right now I wouldn't feel totally comfortable with a partner....I NEVER thought for all of my decades I would admit this but it is true. I also know it will change. The 'mental connection' you speak of is that amazing thing that sooooooooooooo many relationships are lacking. It sounds as though you two are very solid as friends. Please do NOT feel badly about your appearance...apparently you are cared for for reasons that are not shallow.....for the things that make you an indiviudal and unlike any other....I consider your Scorpio friend quite fortunate to know you ~ This door swings both ways. If you need a break...at this point don't announce it......just do it. I KNOW you  will be fine! The ability to be as honest as you are/were with this question and so amazingly and sincerely asking in a public format something so delicate....shows you have amazing courage. I applaud that. Kudos!<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|oDdXpghDaa	Ugh, I got the exact same line from a scorpio about a year ago.  They do have a tendency to be brutally honest without sugar coating it... so he's being honest.  He probably does love you, but just doesn't want to have a relationship at this point in his life.<br>  <br>  Trust me, Scorpio are supposed to be my match made in heaven (I'm Pisces), but these guys are effed up - don't waste you time.  Even if you did start to date, the constant testing he'd do to you would eat you away.  They're all about the testing and challenges.  <br>  <br>  Stay friends - to Scorpio there is nothing more important than a friend.  I'm not even sure they want a relationship as much as they'd PREFER to have a B.F.F.  You'll both be happier in the long run.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	Hmm I'm a Scorpio, I don't just say I love you as a passing fancy I mean it. I think he does to but what I know of Scorpio men is they can want something, so bad but not right now. You just need to wade it out, most Scorpio's need time to decide what they want.. and when were sure. We are sure. Hang on in there girl and don't think it's to your weight, your fabulous!<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|XJTynEaMaa	Scorpio are very passionate and can act peculiar in relationships|`|9fHoK6Djaa	I'm a scorpio to the T and I don't just throw those words around.  Scorpio's are known for their brutal honesty.  What he said is just that.
9VaWal2Daa	No, I disagree.  There is LOVE and then there is LUST. <br>  <br>  I was in LOVE once, and while other woman threw themselves at me.........I was seriously in love, and didn't want to screw it up .<br>  <br>  I could have lusted, and made hay while the sun was shining, but dammit, I LOVED her. <br>  <br>  right up til I caught her in bed with another guy. <br>  <br>  and yeah.......stupid me..............I STILL loved her, <br>  <br>  Broke my heart, but I still LOVED her <br>  <br>  and yeah, I think you can find real love more than once, if you are lucky........but there will always be "The ONE" <br>  <br>  Just because you can't have that one, for whatever reason, does not mean that you cannot love someone else. <br>  <br>  and then , yeah......there's just pure lust.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	because lust is great ..... there is no drama as there is in love|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Well I do think true love can happen more than once. I am divorced and remarried (20 years) and  when I married the first time it was love, but love is not guaranteed to last forever so after 19 years that love died and eventually I found my present husband who I love even more than I ever loved the first husband.I think teenagers falling in and out of "like", more often that love and giving into lust is harmful to their future, mature sex lives. When you give yourself away to someone you're in lust with you've given away one of the most precious gifts you have to offer and turned it in to not much more than a kiss. In a long term relationship with someone you know and love that's when you give that precious gift. If you've been casually having sex with anyone who attracted your lust factor I think it demeans sex and gives you a warped sense of how sex should be making love. If you just want sexual satisfaction you can provide that to yourself.|`|Up6ANLQeaa	Because some people are sooo desperate to be "in love" that they will happily pretend that they are.|`|gIitANOkaa	Love is only a chemical reaction that lasts no more than 2 year...<br>  <br>  <br>  <3 Harold Saenger|`|K2QwEM4raa	True love is not always only once.

I was a child/teen in the 80s, so it was great then, but also I've seen it played on TV many times throughout the years. I like the guys who do the gore scenes. The part with the new teacher or sub or whatever was great where they set up the class as a horror scene. Courtney Thorne-Smith's early film career who went on to one of my fave shows...Melrose Place! Mark Harmon was a cutie then too.|`|AA11601079	Yup, I've seen it a couple of times.

Cracked me up!|`|ZKg1yNeUaa	Yes! A million times! How can somebody have NOT seen it? Everyone has! I'd say ONE of my favorite parts is the scene with the eyeballs that pop out!

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	"The word "Happyness" in the title has been taken from the misspelling of "Fun Joy Happyness" on a mural children have painted on the Chinatown daycare center where Chris Gardner takes his son, Christopher. When Chris points out the mistake, Mrs. Chu replies that it is not important to the pre-schoolers how the word is spelled, only that they have happiness. This leads Chris to contemplate the inclusion of the concept of the individual's right to "pursuit of happiness" in the Declaration of Independence, and how to pursue a happier, more emotionally secure childhood for his son, than his own had been."|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Is Wikipedia broken?<br>  <br>  Look all that stuff up.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	Why are you asking these questions, just watch the movie, the answers are not difficult to find.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Collins went on to win a lawsuit against Jones and was awarded $10,800, which Jones never paid. Five years after Northcott's execution, one of the boys that Northcott allegedly killed was found alive and well. As Walter Collins' body had not been found, Christine Collins still hoped that Walter had survived. She continued to search for him for the rest of her life, but she died without ever knowing her son's fate. The last public record of Christine Collins is from 1941, when she attempted to collect a $15,562 judgment against Captain Jones (by then a retired police officer) in the Superior Court.<br>  If Water was still alive, he'd be an old man. Too, public record keeping back in the 40's was not as good as today so it's not known exactly when or where Christine Collins died and is buried. It's probably in the LA area--somewhere.|`|Sgz5bGzEaa	<a href="http://takingforyou.uk.to" rel="nofollow">http://takingforyou.uk.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

akUVg7CEaa	The blues has been going strong since the 1920's, it survived the great depression.  Which this down turn is not even close to being like.  It also survived its displacement by more popular forms of music.  So I think it will stay as it has always been a form of music that has many fans, but is more on the fringe.<br>  <br>  The themes of blues music, which are loss of love, home, money, and happiness are always with us.  So musicians who want to focus on these themes will always have material to sing about.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Great minds think a like!

I listen to and play blues, we've had blues concerts here in Hobbs and Ruidoso, and blues shows every Sunday night on local radio  <br>  Blues are probably apropos for the state the country's in, but what needs a revival is ethics in Washington, and spefically, the democrooked party.|`|958b3c9dfffbd359af24a34956241277aa	I really don't get these questions.  Blues had a resurgence in the early 80's and has been flyin' high ever since.  It simply is not a big commercial money maker.  Never was.  Likely won't be.  But in the shadows.  Never was.  And likely won't be.  I like that because you don't have to deal with the whims of some big company, or the "next wave", or the next load of sh!t to hit the airwaves.  Look what happened to rock in the 80's.  Name one great "rock" band from the 80's.  Please exclude the hairbands.  They sucked.  G&R was OK.  But the 80's were dead for music.  Country sucked too.  Everything was done on a computer or polished to the point of being unrecognizable as being done by humans.|`|oN519wDmaa	Its very likely ,,,,Look at what happend in the 80's ,,,,The Blues had a major revival ,,,,Then when things picked up the blues had a drop in popularity|`|0cMVKUnAaa	No, lol.<br>  R&B, but not blues|`|5263914089c28cf48456961afa4a910eaa	Seeing as rock is roughly based on blues patterns, i could see it comming back to the mainstream, in a way. It won't be full throttle blues though... people, or should i say this generation, haven't been exposed to it as much. But it definately could come out in some of the rock bands. For example, many people are influenced by Led Zeppelin who combined blues and rock.|`|ZKg1yNeUaa	I don't believe it will. There are so many politically charged rock/punk/etc. bands that discuss things like that in their music, there won't be any need for another genre. Though, they may incorporate some blues-type sounds into their music...<br>  <br>  R&B? Really? R&B singers don't sing about these types of issues! When have they ever?

Glad I found it!  :)|`|Ml22a6evaa	all the time,I've rediscovered Wilson Pickett after six months I completely forgotten about having it<br>  Land Of A Thousnd Dances-Wilson Pickett-<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U8CDzRk2WE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U8CDzRk2...</a>|`|00d16583a6262fd502ed6a2c9d7dee08aa	Same here:)...just got out of a Pixies phase myself and now somehow I've found myself pulling out a bunch of old 70's music. WAR, Curtis Mayfield, Billy Preston. I'm all over the place. no telling where I'll be 6 weeks from now!|`|hGVkInSnaa	I generally go in like a circle type thing or like phases when I listen to music. Right now, I'm listening to Meatloaf for the first time in months.|`|us6bPTrPaa	I've had that with The Outline, for anyone who hasn't heard of them, they did a popular song called Shotgun.|`|f279e76fb473e663c0561d5e2597318baa	i used to like Van Halen but i lost their greatest hits cd and all there songs were wiped off my pc, but one year on and i've re-discovered them. they are my 5th favorite band|`|j6Sv8eWYaa	The Beatles..<br>  <br>  over and over again :D|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Yes with bands like The Flock, Spooky Tooth, and the Rascals<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I definitely go through phases... will listen to some one or some group exclusively for weeks sometimes.... and likewise will neglect others for sometimes years at a time ;-D<br>  <br>  After Jerry Garcia died I didn't listen to the Dead for a long time ~ like 10 years! It wasn't a conscious decision ~ I guess I just wasn't in the mood. <br>  <br>  Well, that changed a year or two ago, and I've bought probably 6-7 CDs in that time ('cause all I had was vinyl! lol) and have been enjoying them *very* much again. Between American Beauty, From the Mars Hotel, and Wake of the Flood, I've been listening to nothing else for a couple of weeks!|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Yea, I do that sometimes but it usually doesn't last long for me. I will listen to band for an hour or two and then move on and pretty much forget about them until the next time I "rediscover" them. haha<br>  <br>  I did that with Static-X a few weeks ago. I was listening to a few of their albums and remembering how I used to love them.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Dave said it rather well there : music cycles<br>  <br>  I have so much music sitting on my PC for me to work my way through, that I tend to have a regular turnover of different bands & artists. But, after a few weeks, I'll have a sudden urge to go back to one of my favourites for a few hours / days. <br>  <br>  I'm currently in a 'between' phase ~ still working through the new stuff ~ but you are giving me Peter Steele cravings... {his music, not him ~ I've seen *those* photos, and I wasn't impressed...!}|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	I have the complete discography of SUPERTRAMP but for some reason I haven't listened to them in a long while until a few weeks ago. They are simply fantastic and for me one for those underrated bands  most rock lovers dismiss too easily.<br>  <br>  Here one of their great songs<br>  <br>  Asylum<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wBGBrXd5M&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wBGBrXd...</a>|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Yes it happens to me too.<br>  <br>  Queen<br>  Black Oak Arkansas<br>  Led Zeppelin
gQkPrGAQaa	Whatever MILF status she gained can be easily negated by her commercial bull$hit music and the strong possibility that her @$$ is packed with fecal remains (follow the link and you'll understand).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/12226" rel="nofollow">http://newsbusters.org/node/12226</a>|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	You know, she's certainly not my cup of tea, and I'm certainly not a fan, but I think there's a lot worse. I thought her Sweet Child o Mine was egregious and Sookie's right, All I Wann Do is terrible, but I think she's had some moments of decency. She seems to come from a decent place in a music appreciation sort of a way.<br>  <br>  I think the thing with her is that she belongs to a genre that I'm not terribly into in general (that sort of ad con soft rock), but as far as that stuff goes I would probably listen to her above a ton of the other options. I actually have one song in my itunes library because I heard part of it and it was pretty cool, turned out that it wasn't that great in it's entirety, but there's some neat stuff going on in there. I also give her that she was in the Minus Man which was a very cool movie.<br>  <br>  All in all, meh.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Oh man Beatle, that was her. I heard that in a Cost Plus about 6 months ago or so and didn't know who did it. I can tell you I drove my wife crazy because I whined for pretty much the whole duration of the song about how terrible it was. Then I whined about it a lot of the next day when it came back to me. Man, I had just repressed that and was finally capable of being happy again. Thanks a lot.|`|dFacbjIZaa	What do I think? I think She's a Babe-orama. I think Her amazingly sexy voice makes me want to do bad bad things to Her. I have heard other women with better voices, but I don't think I have ever heard one whose singing voice is sexier to me. That being said, She has about 3 songs I really like (If It Makes You Happy, C'Mon C'Mon, and All I Wanna Do) and several that make Me want to scrape My own ear off with a spork (Picture, The First Cut Is The Deepest) I have given serious consideration to driving a truck through a wall and a jukebox before because of Picture.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Morning, Perse!<br>  <br>  I liked her debut "Tuesday Night Music Club" when it first came out.  But then that "All I Wanna Do" song (my least favorite on the album) blew up and I honestly got sick of her.  Nothing really moved me after that.<br>  <br>  Oh, I hear you!  That song makes me want to throw things! *grrr*|`|1ViGcF3xaa	How can you NOT like her after her cover of this Led Zeppelin song?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw_4LWeIvMM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw_4LWeIv...</a><br>  <br>  What's wrong with you, Lol?<br>  <br>  Edit: ***Disclaimer***<br>  I'm not responsible if anyone's ears were injured from listening and I'm sorry!|`|hGVkInSnaa	I think that she's overrated. Some of her songs are okay but they aren't particularly memorable. Like, I can't think of any of her songs right now.|`|IBvz3tckaa	i've liked her ever since i heard If It Makes You Happy although i haven't  listened to her lately. and yeah, she is pretty hot.|`|RVAPQg6Waa	Sheryl Crow is an evil succubus who need to pay for her crimes...<br>  <br>  ...|`|bm289GOuaa	Usually I don't think about her at all. She probably pops into my head about 4 times a year, excluding the times I hear her on the radio. I don't think she's anything special. She's built her entire reputation on what? One, maybe two really big hits, which she had years ago. "Blah blah blah, likes to peel the labels from his bottles of BUUUD! Blah blah blah, lettin' each one burn, blah blah blah, but all I wanna do is play with mah titties! I got a feelin' I'm not the only one! Ohh play with mah titties until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard!" God, if that's all it takes to be important then A-ha must be one of the most f*cking revolutionary acts to come out since The Velvet Ungerground.|`|H1mGTwvWaa	not a fan. <br>  but i did like her first video. i thought she had sexy lips...|`|aKBqMLuhaa	OMG Beatle Fanatic i want to burn my ears off now.<br>  <br>  I think she's a great backup singer and an ok song writer, but that is about it.<br>  <br>  Every day is a Winding Road and My Favorite Mistake are decent|`|W0AK2Lumaa	I Didnt like her Pop song that everyone liked but HEr I do...|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Interesting Q Persephone...<br>  <br>  I'm not really a fan of Sheryl, though I do have enough of her songs {mostly from the "C'mon C'mon" album, but some earlier 'teenage nostalgia' songs} to fill one 80 minute CD. The best of those is a b-side called 'You're Not the One' ~ but the lyrics were written by Stevie Nicks!<br>  <br>  I'm not too happy about her work with Stevie Nicks {she had no place being on Stevie's 2001 solo album}, and I especially don't like the way she got so full of herself, announcing that she was joining Fleetwood Mac. As I always responded to people on that subject "she has no place in a band of such talent". Yet another hanger-on of coat-tails... This behaviour showed that she believes herself to be something she is not ~ she assumed Fleetwood Mac would want her in the band, but she could *never* replace Christine McVie {which was clearly her intention}, especially as her style of music is not right for this particular band. I don't like Sheryl as a person...<br>  <br>  <br>  To basically sum-up :~<br>  I certainly wouldn't call myself a fan, but I do like some songs.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Interesting question because I don't know how I feel about her. She does one of my favorite songs ever: My Favorite Mistake ~ and I've got a couple of her albums and her 'best of' CD... but they're not in heavy rotation ~ not by a long shot!<br>  <br>  Final answer: I think she's okay. But this song ROCKS~ Just love how she 'hits' those strings.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hh0wNpqqY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hh0wNpq...</a><br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  OMG, Beatle! I answered a "tribute" question yesterday and mentioned that on the Led Zep "Encomium" album there are a couple real stinkers.... that's one of 'em! LOL!!|`|OTFzJbaMaa	she is not my cup of tea... or coffee... or lemonade... or anything <br>  <br>  i do not enjoy her no no no i dont<br>  i dont like her voice<br>  i don think shes a good gutair player of musician<br>  personally i cant say anything negative about her because i dont knoe much of her but from a music stand point im not a fan. <br>  <br>  and good morning!|`|VXQFT341aa	She is a MILF!

cYtPfXkJaa	I didn't see it, but it's probably a bit unfair to impose the very high standards of Flight of the Conchords on a production, because it is based in the same continent.<br>  <br>  Having said that, have you seen Summer Heights High or We Can Be Heroes? Both Chris Lilley who is Australian, rather than NZ, but both amazing :) Between Chris Lilly and Bret/Jemaine, all my antipodean comedy slots are filled! x|`|iufYtd21aa	I thought it was quite good.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Well, I got hammered by some for my thoughts on Brahms so let's see how many people I can provoke with this answer on Bruckner. Strangely enough, I have just finished listening to a recording (the only one, I think) of the original 1872 version of his Second Symphony.<br>  <br>  Actually one part of my answer to your questrion about Brahms holds true for Bruckner too - that, had he not existed, music would have been very little different for it. Bruckner worshipped God and Wagner (in that order) and Wagner's influence can be heard very clearly in Bruckner's 'early' works particularly. I typed 'early' because Bruckner was a very late developer musically - his First Symphony did not appear until 1866, when he was 42. The only large-scale works to predate the First Symphony were a now seldom heard Requiem from 1849, an Overture in G minor (1862), a 'study' symphony in F minor (1863) and Masses Nos 1 (1864) and 2 (1866).<br>  <br>  I enjoy Bruckner's music but think you have to enter a certain kind of mindset to listen to them. Bruckner was one of the most expansive of composers and many of his symphonies last well over an hour, with many single movements around or exceeding the 20-minute mark.<br>  <br>  Bruckner's adoration of Wagner famously manifested itself in in the incorporation of quotations from 'Lohengrin' and 'Die Walküre' in the original version of the Third Symphony (these were expunged in the several later revisions of the work). While Bruckner's music never sounds like Wagner, it shares the advanced harmonic thinking of Wagner's music and some of Bruckner's movements explore almost all known keys during their progress.<br>  <br>  Bruckner is perhaps most famous (or infamous) for listening too much to the criticism of others. This resulted in his constant revision of many of his symphonies to such an extent that several of his symphonies (which form the bulk of his very small output) were revised over and over again:<br>  Symphony No 1 - 3 versions<br>  Symphony No 2 - 4 versions<br>  Symphony No 3 - 3 versions (the first dedicated to Wagner and containing quotes from the 'Ring')<br>  Symphony No 4 - 2 versions<br>  Symphony No 8 - 2 versions (3 if you count the Nowak and Haas editions as different enough)<br>  <br>  The versions above are further complicated by numerous editions published (and often tampered with) by various publishers and editors - sometimes without Bruckner's knowledge or consent. The symphonies not listed above all exist in at least two different editions, with minor differences between them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the different versions of the symphonies vary in relatively small (but still clearly noticeable) ways, while sometimes whole movements have been restructured or, as in the fourth and eighth symphonies, completely re-written from scratch (having little or no resemblance to each other).<br>  <br>  It would seem that Bruckner was, on one hand, very insecure and, on the other, very painstaking and fastidious about getting his music just right. He was tinkering with most of his symphonies in some small way or another right up until his death in 1896.<br>  <br>  I find it fascinating to listen to the various versions of the symphonies as it is possible to follow Bruckner's train of musical thought as he pared-down and altered the music in an effort to gain more acceptance and more performances.<br>  <br>  The only composer I can think of whose music was influenced by Bruckner's to any extent was Franz Schmidt (1874-1939) and so, while Bruckner's music is enjoyed by many, it served no 'purpose' in the development of music (not that this is important, of course).|`|1204e9a4f0121ebac48e7d8f61d56242aa	I enjoy Bruckner's music when I am in the right mood to listen to it. If you are wanting to hear something lush and expansive then that is the time to put on some Bruckner. Top 25? Maybe, but probably not! Bruckner was his own worst enemy in that he listened to too many others about his music and was forever revising it.<br>  <br>  The best thing about his music - it is lush and expansive.<br>  The worst thing about his music - it is lush and expansive.<br>  <br>  All that aside,I must admit that he is one of my favorite composers.<br>  <br>  Musician, composer, teacher.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Poor Bruckner! I guess he is what you get when you combine elements of genius with huge self confidence problems and an obsessive nature...<br>  <br>  He could never seem to be satisfied with his work, nor could he ignore the criticism of others.<br>  <br>  His 8th symphony is a masterpiece, but one wonders would it have been any less so had it been a quarter of an hour shorter? At an hour and a half it certainly is of epic proportions.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	I may be misquoting Sir Thomas Beecham here but he once said that he counted four abortions and a miscarriage in one of Bruckner's symphonies.  Bruckner does have this habit if introducing a theme and then failing to develop it. His music is certainly not my cup of tea,|`|xcPzZvsraa	Well the first time I heard one of his symphonies(I think it was the 5th) I was rather unimpressed.<br>  Largely because I had approached it with somewhat preconceived notions to which it didn't match up and as a result yes I admit I thought him boring and his symphonies over long with passages that seem to go on forever.<br>  I more or less forgot about  him until I heard a particularly amazing performance of the 9th with Bruno Walter.<br>  I'm tempted to think is symphonies(more than most) require top notch conductors who truly understand them.<br>  A clear mental grasp,unflinching command of the orchestral forces and a strong will to impose on these monumental symphonic structures to hold them together and avoid them being somewhat rambling(well certainly in parts).<br>  I agree with Malcolm the 8th is a masterpiece though I've got a Wilhelm Furtwangler recording which certainly helps to convince.<br>   <br>  Bruckner is not one of my favourite composers but from a symphonic perspective I'd rather listen to his 8th or 9th than say any of those by Mozart! <br>  However that merely reflects my particular taste.<br>  <br>  I'm trying to think of an analogy so here's a bad one from the movies: <br>  If experiencing a Beethoven symphony would be akin to watching "Apocalypse Now" than Bruckner would be like  say more of an acquired taste like Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line"<br>  Ponderous  to some,certainly different but enthralling in it's own way though never destined to be a generation defining masterpiece like Coppola's.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	For a refreshing change try his absolutely wonderful motets.<br>  <br>  locus iste, Os Justi and many other really quite small-scale gems of the repertoire.<br>  <br>  He was a church organist and his devotional music is without equal.

Her boss, concerned his employee, walks over to her and asks sympathetically, "What's the matter?" The blonde replies, "Early this morning I got a phone call that my mother had passed away." <br>  <br>  The boss, feeling very sorry at this point suggests to the young girl, "Why don't you go home for the day...we aren't terribly busy. Just take <br>  the day off and go relax." <br>  <br>  Sally very calmly states, "No I'd be better off here. I need to keep my mind busy and I have the best chance of doing that here." <br>  <br>  The boss agrees and allows her to work as usual. "If you need anything just let me know" says the boss. <br>  <br>  A few hours pass and the boss decides to check on Sally. He looks out his office and sees her crying hysterically. <br>  <br>  He rushes over an asks, "What's the matter now? Are you going to be ok?" <br>  <br>  Sally breaks down in tears.

I hope it wins at least something on Sunday. it was very beautiful. I didn't see much acting in the movie. Kate was awesome, but i didn't see her shining. It was the plot, the story, just melted my heart. Same thing with Slumdog Millionaire. No acting, just the plot & story. <br>  <br>  On the flipside, Doubt's situation was stupid. It's a very common story, the movie was too short, the plot was ridiculous. But the ACTING was incredible.

Hp18CSwLaa	cancer and virgo are very different, so you may have some problems with criticism because of virgo's perfectionism. cancer is a bit oversensitive, and sometimes the slightest of harsh words will offend him. Remember that cancer doesn't come out of his shell easily, and takes a long while to forgive.<br>  <br>  However, you can still make a very good couple. Virgo can learn to be more affectionate from Cancer, while Cancer can learn to be more rational and not too overly emotional.<br>  <br>  Now personally, I don't believe in Horoscope, so look past that. You definitely have your differences, but if you can love each other unconditionally, and respect each others perspectives, you can have a long and happy relationship. This holds true for all people, regardless of their zodiac sign.<br>  <br>  good luck:D|`|p0NnFB7Daa	uh..........wha?|`|V20PTwMmaa	cancers are annoying as frick.  you will soon learn this and be dismayed.  you will run and never look back.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	Both signs get on well but,there's more to you both than just your sun signs. Your fate is in your own hands,Astrology gives direction ,only you can choose the road you travel.If you love each other then yes,your relationship will work.Love is the key to successful relationships Astrology is just a tool, used to give us insight into ourselves and our loved ones.Follow your heart!|`|GNxhkuXIaa	A virgo and a cancer?  Hoo-boy, you guys are SKUH-REWED!<br>  <br>  It's like a Montague and a Capulet, that sh*t just don't fly.<br>  <br>  Now, if it were a virgo and a dragon, or a virgo and an ox, it might work.  But a virgo and a cancer together, I mean that's almost like a virgo and a cock.  Or worse, a virgo and a sheep.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	which one or you?I have a book that says this is a potentially great relationship as long as Virgo doesn't criticize the Cancer too much.It also says the Cancer has a large appetite for love and care and that the Virgo may not be able to live up to this need.|`|And9dyrwaa	VIRGO goes best with Taurus, Capricorn, Cancer and Scorpio.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Im a cancer boy and I've found virgo girls very hot.  Definitely think it has potential.  I just sometimes wish they tone down the critical side of them.
c1Ob2S9raa	Maybe you could change it and instead of having a movie, you could put a folding table out with snacks, and music, and then you could dance, or play games....or if you wanna keep the movie idea, then just put a bunch of blankets on the ground, and make it look awesome with a bunch of pillows, and everyone wont care there isnt a couch!|`|AA10659059	don't cancel your party. sitting on the floor is so much fun while watching a movie. you could spread a blanket or any comfortable material to sit on and don't forget some pillows and good snacks. your friends would appreciate it as long as you're together having fun. <br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|oWpZ8Ik9aa	this is neither a joke or a riddle!<br>  <br>  anyway...........if i were u i would ask them to deal with it<br>  life isnt perfect!<br>  <br>  joke.................sorry<br>  u should just put in a load of blankets and pillows then have pillow fights<br>  (i liked the first idea better though:)|`|DNQxUcptaa	How about get evryone to bring a piece of carpet, or what about bean bags?!

sjD26raeaa	I highly doubt it since there are many dvd releases and they can't make them all and most likely any since they are filiming new moon and most likely can't get away. the movie comes out in november and they don't have the time to take a break from filming for it. they begin filming at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada<br>  so there is some hope but since filimg starts the same month i don't think they can. <br>  Too bad tho|`|6sb24oLGaa	I wish. I live near NYC but they will probably not come to the release. :-(<br>  But if they do. Yay!

Effy & Panda only stayed because they wasn't at college in the first series.|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	Hey ;)<br>  <br>  Basically the actors were ageing, and the story line from series 2 saw everybody go off in their own direction (so the group wouldn't actually still be together now). Skins is based on college life (i.e. Roundview college) and so, after two years (and 2 series), once the characters had left college, they needed to start again!<br>  <br>  It'll probably happen every 2 series..|`|CqAD7dXCaa	There had to be new people because the characters from the last series had graduated from college.

EkHKJKZFaa	soundgarden wins the race|`|bm289GOuaa	"some of you will say sp is not grunge but Their stuff from 1991-1996 was."<br>  OH NO IT WASN'T.<br>  Fact #1: Grunge's roots are, first and foremost, in PUNK. In fact, in grunge's very early days, it was simply considered a form of punk and didn't even have a name. The name "grunge" was given to it by the media because of something one of the founders of Sub Pop (Jonathan Poneman, I think) said in an interview which got taken out of context.<br>  Fact #2: Given that grunge's roots are basically in punk, a style noted for its near-embarrassing simplicity, it follows that most grunge tunes should be fairly easy for beginning guitarists to learn to play. And you know what? That is indeed the case. But you try to get someone who's only been playing guitar, self taught, for 6 months or less, to play an SP song, and more often than not THEY CAN'T DO IT. Why? Because most SP songs, even the really early ones, are not "simple" enough for beginners. In other words, they're not "punk" enough. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE NOT GRUNGE.<br>  Fact #3: The Pumpkins went out of their way to be as distinct from the grunge movement as possible, and they did some very ANTI-GRUNGE things to drive the point home, including using sh*tloads of multitracking on the guitar, having fast and complex guitar solos, jazz-like drum fills, etc, etc. Even their manner of dress was like a reaction against grunge 'cause grungers tended to look a bit scruffy or dirty whereas the Pumpkins had nice clean hair and shirts and stuff. <br>  About the only grungey thing Billy Corgan ever did was stick his d*ck into Courtney Love and that's the truth.<br>  Even working with B*TCH VUG (oops I mean BUTCH VIG) couldn't make the Pumpkins a grunge band (but then working with him couldn't make anyone a grunge band -- Nirvana tried and almost wound up sounding like Hall & Oates).<br>  Having said all that (and enjoyed my little rant), I'm gonna play along anyway and choose Smashing Pumpkins, just because I feel like answering your question arbitrarily and against my better judgement concerning '90s pop culture. Besides, they were awesome back then, regardless of what you label them as. However, for the record, they were simply classified as "alternative rock" back then -- which does NOT mean "grunge". Grunge was a TYPE of alternative rock, but it wasn't the only type. It's like, if you listen to SP's Gish, "I Am One", "Siva", "Tristessa", or Siamese Dream with "Soma" or "Quiet", that's actually more like a form of heavy metal than anything like grunge. You know?<br>  Pity about them now though, eh?|`|v721s9KKaa	Smashing pumpkins because even still today nothing sounds like them when they were at their peak.

W8aiAWe2aa	I would suspect she is checking a mole for malignant melanoma? As an ex model she may have used sunbeds and been a sun worshipper. This would increase her risks of skin cancer too.<br>  <br>  May be it's her they are writing out of the series?|`|2quTUoA6aa	I think the way they ended last nights episode that they're trying to make us think it's skin cancer. However I think it's going to eventually be a brain tumer (which Derek will be asked to fix) or it will be one of those off the wall illnesses that you see in House episodes all the time. Either way, they probably will not resolve what happens to her until the first episode next season.

Just my opinion.|`|usnZsrz7aa	i dont really like her nor do i think she should die..<br>  that's bad you shouldn't wish anybody death..<br>  but, n-e ways i do think she should retire already her interviews are boring and are not that interesting..|`|AA12390047	I just can't bring myself to watch her anymore.

OBuzcIDbaa	Once an abuser, always an abuser unless they get professional help. He's obviously got issues and Rhianna should get away from him and stay away from him. To me that is totally unforgivable to hurt someone like that. There is no good excuse no matter how much he apologizes. He should still be punished and forced into counseling. If Rhianna goes back with him, she needs counseling as well.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	That's so wrong that TMZ and yahoo are even posting this picture.  She is a victim and if it's an authentic picture, someone at the police station is corrupt.  Showing this picture is sending all domestic violence victims a message that if they report their abuser, their picture might end up getting in the wrong hands.<br>  <br>  Fox, you're an idiot for blaming the victim.  Chris Brown is an abuser, abusers don't think long term of "oh what if people find out".  Rihanna could have slept with Chris Brown's mom and that would still not give him any right to lay his hands on her.  Some people don't "deserve it" like you said.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chris Brown didn't have a scratch on him and there has been no mention of a gun, why are so quick to find an excuse for an abuser?  You hate women that believe that men shouldn't hit them?  You're a tool.|`|0MunIx8raa	I did see the picture. Looks pretty bad.  I wonder why he beat her up like that?  I mean some people just deserve it.  Not saying she did, but I wonder what drove him to do that?  It had to of been something awful b/c he knows that they are both famous and it would get out, but he didn't care...so it had to be something really bad for him to take it that far don't ya think?<br>  <br>  Ilovebob...I point blank said that I wasn't saying she deserved it, but YES some people do.  You don't know what happened, you don't know the circumstances, hell she may have come at him with a gun or something, you never know.  I hate feminists.<br>  <br>  No, I hate women who always think other women are so frail and can't handle themselves and that they are never to blame for anything b/c they are women.  Just b/c he didn't have a scratch on him doesn't mean something didn't go down.  I don't think it's right that he beat her, but we don't know what went on!  Hell that picture don't even look like her!  I have dated men who like to hit and ya know what?  I didn't allow it.  If one came at me and I knew I couldn't handle him I would grab the nearest thing and knock his a ss over the head with it!  Then leave him.  But ya know what?  Sometimes I did provoke it!  I take blame for that!  But I still defended myself and didn't let him beat me up.|`|DcUoZntOaa	yup, real bad! he should get his a## kicked by a real man!<br>  peace!|`|kGkUG0fKaa	sad photo but being that the media said, it was not the 1st time he beat her down, I can't feel sorry for someone who puts themself in danger. Besides I am not taking either one of their sides because I was not in the car with them that day. Who knows what really went down, even though he should not have done that to her, if he was provoked and it happened before then its reasonable to see that happening again. I feel sad for both because they are young but its their relationship. I have never liked Rhianna's music (her voice annoys me) but i will continue to think the chick has crazy style and I am a fan of Chris Browns music and will continue to listen to it. <br>  <br>  Just like Michael Jackson and R. kelly, Their personal lives are on trial not their music. I am a fan of their MUSIC, not them personally because I do not know them personally to make such a judgement. If their personal lives are in turmoil but the music is good, I could care less what kind of issues they have in their personal life because I have my own to worry about. F**K em both, they're still rich so why get my tummy in a knot!|`|3LhwoBPDaa	Yes, and I'd LOVE for you to see the "beaten" picture of Chris Brown from my daydream. I've never gotten in a fight or been violent(I'm 20) and EVEN I want to mess him up.<br>  <br>  You have to understand though women like Rihanna fall the flowers, kisses and expensive gifts after the beatings and allow themselves to be continually victimized.<br>  <br>  There are several things that keep a women with an abuser: lack of money, embarassment, nowhere else to go, and they're really in love.<br>  <br>  Funny how only possibly the last one applies to Rihanna...ahhh...young lust...a MESS...feel bad for her physically...(and emotionally)|`|zYsOWu4Saa	They say love is blind but if she goes back with him it might be to late for her to see anything. If you know what I mean(dead). We seen what happen to women in relationships like this before.|`|XLtQ6ZU9aa	I feel so bad for her. I do not think that Rihanna should give him another chance she looks really hurt.|`|6b411d8c2b928cab641819a7b415bc26aa	He should be history!|`|AqXadhUzaa	We have to ask...Is that actually Rihanna?

She doesn't have a tat on her shoulder. Don't believe everything TMZ says, they aren't exactly a reputable news source.|`|eKuvx6f8aa	I don't care! I don't even know who she is bc I don't wanna know-I've heard her name too much.And I NEVER even heard of Chris Brown til he knocked the crap outta her!

AA11588752	Back to Yr 8 @ High School where we were asked to choose which course ie., Professional or Business Course.<br>  I would have chosen Business because then I would have gone through and finished high school and went on to higher education to become a kindergarten teacher (the professional I really wanted to pursue)<br>  Because my family(influenced by my semi nerdy quieter older brother) choose Professional Course (meant for the brainy types & nerds) I barely passed both years and because of such disappointing results.

3WItFAwlaa	I've had more than I can count.  The most amazing involved relatives who had just died.  I saw where they went.  Interesting how they were all different.  My cousin's daughter who was 10 and had never even moved because the umbilical cord rapped around her head when she was born was running and laughing in a field of flowers.  A tall robed figure appeared.  There were no words just a sense of "It is time".  His face was all light but I know who He was.  She took His hand and walked away.  My brother had his dog with him.  My grandma was greeted by a very large crowd.  My grandpa called her by her nickname and asked what took her so long.|`|HSSuKNCUaa	Two years ago, a friend of mine died who I hadn't seen in a few years. But my mother and his mother were still friends.<br>  <br>  One night I had the strange feeling - didn't see or hear, just sensed - that he was in the room. In fact I knew exactly where he was sitting and I just figured he wanted to tell me something. Really weird, I know. But I grabbed my tarot cards (which I always only use for insight in the here and now for myself, never for communication with the dead or to predict anything). I drew a card while I focused on the feeling of him being in the room and just freely interpreted on my intuition, not so much by the book. From what I understood he wanted me to tell his mother about a book of financial debt.<br>  <br>  So I called my mum about it, she called his mum, and it turned out that he did have a book of debts to his mother that - in short - would save her from bankruptcy. His father had never been involved in his life, and wanted to inherit his expensive photography equipment, and because he had written down his debts to his mother his father would inherit only debt.<br>  <br>  So yeah, that was weird.|`|B7WIZdglaa	When I use to live w/my parents, I was in bed one night ready to go to sleep. I was pretty much in the stages of sleep when I heard someone say "Look". I don't know if it was in my head, or in my ear, but I opened my eyes and my blinds were swinging from side to side. The window was NOT open because it was winter. I sat up and ran in the living room and slept in there. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend use to live in a pretty old apartment. When we were sitting on the couch watching tv, the doorway to the kitchen was right next to the tv, so we could see in the kitchen while sitting in the living room. I use to constantly see black shadows floating along the ceiling. No joke. I thought it was my eyes because I was watching tv and sort of seeing it from the side of my vision- but I literally saw it from the corner of my eye, and then looked right at it, and still saw it. I saw them all the time! Once I saw one "walk" past me while I was standing in the kitchen. I never said anything until my boyfriend mentioned it one day! He saw them too.. it made me feel much better knowing I wasn't insane.|`|46q6xyKmaa	I've had quite a few but one sticks out; 2 summers ago was sitting on main floor of my house and had to run upstairs for something.  Took off up the stairs and at the top was a tall misty human form cloud!  Couldn't stop fast enough and ran right through it!  Instant freeze!  I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around...it was gone, but I couldn't stop shaking!  Had to go down and get a sweater and sit on the couch bundled up until the warmth came back.  Always felt a presence there and heard footsteps walk through the house when in the basement one day, too, but never saw an apparition again.  Eerie!|`|p0NnFB7Daa	well one time me and my bro almost got struck by lightning-when we were little,me and my bre would go to our neibors backyard and play in his basketball court,so one time me my bro and all our friends from the block were playing basketball as it started to rain,so we all did the logical thing and decided to get all our stuff and goin inside our houses.me and my bro were leaving through this little shortcut passage thing right over my friends fence,but then I remembered mu hoody was still on the fence where I left it.so I told my brother "wait,I left my hoody".and he said "well then,lets hurry up and get it".so we turned around to go get my hoodie when all of the sudden this really thin strip of purple blueish light hit the ground inches from me and my brother.It was so fast that I didnt know  if it was real or not,so I turned to my brother and asked"did you see that?"and he said"yeah,you mean the lightning right?" and I said " yeah".though there was nobody else to witness it,atleast theres still the hole where the lightning hit the ground.boy was that weirdO_O|`|DOPC968zaa	<a href="http://allininfo.mooo.com" rel="nofollow">http://allininfo.mooo.com</a> <br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|hQNmgdQ7aa	I don't have any.

The females usually have work done to improve their looks and I suspect that's what you are seeing in the ones you mention AND some of them start out as skinny little actresses and since age has a way of filling us out a little, it really makes them look better than when they started acting.|`|noKmxO8Vaa	Angelina Jolie was really ugly when she was younger. Now she's pretty.|`|0cMVKUnAaa	Courtney Cox<br>  <br>  Billions and billions of dollars|`|StqBr5XRaa	Diane Lane|`|d5zEYomEaa	I think Jennifer Aniston. She just turned 40 but looks 25 and better than ever.<br>  <br>  Not to blow your bubble, but have you seen pics of Madonna without any makeup on. OMG trust me, there's nothing to be in awe about, same with Katherine Zeta Jones who I think has aged very very badly. It was painful watching her last movie because she looked 50 trying to play off as a young youthful lady which she can't pull off anymore. I think the reason is that women who have children suddenly age a lot, Nicole finally had one very recently and hasn't been in the media so I don't know how she looks post baby, and Aniston hasn't had children so she'll look young for a long time. Angelina on the other hand aged quite a bit after giving birth but I think all women are beautiful, and hundreds of thousands spent on plastic surgery doesn't hurt their looks. Imagine how all them would look without it.<br>  <br>  For example Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Drew Barrymoor have humungous chin implants that give their face a longer leaner look (looks like the ones male stars get but a little bit smaller) but in the wrong angle or in real life they look a little deformed and monstrous. Botox, eyelifts, face lifts, lip injections, makeup artists, liposuction all add up to the final product you see. And most have those cheek implants to give the illusion of high cheek bones. The ugliest people (which some of these stars used to be) can look glamorous with all the procedures available out there.|`|y6qQDwMWaa	Yes, it's called plastic surgery.|`|6bQbkRDMaa	drew barrymore<br>  <br>  and they got that way with plastic surgery<br>  and personal trainers<br>  or starving themselves|`|a89cztkXaa	Gerard Way- His face just never changes! xD

dCbIHBpGaa	No its not for a kid of 11 to watch and doesn't show wrestling in a positive light but centres on old broken down wrestlers past their prime that keep on going through the pain and the injuries because they can't give up and if that's means competing in front of 50 people for a few dollars then that's what they do. The sex scene and the scenes inside the strip club would also not really be suitable for an 11 year old too. The film is rated R in America and rated 15 in the UK.<br>  <br>  It is a brilliant brilliant film, don't get me wrong, but its probably not going to appeal to WWE fans.|`|AA10491480	no no no i loved wrestling and the m movie ruined it for me i would Say no honey stay far away|`|13Td1h7Kaa	I used to be a wrestler, therefore I believe I can help you out. This is my first time I actually answer to someone in yahoo so I’m happy to help you out. The wrestler is a great movie but it was actually not "produced for fan".<br>  <br>  The wrestler is a kind of a day to day wrestlers real life documentary. It doesn’t has explosions nor the big sweet stuff we enjoy as fans. You say that it is for your 11 years old kid... juuummmmm. I feel like the Grinch in Christmas right now, but I strongly don’t recommend the movie to an 11 year kid.<br>  <br>  The movie has material that includes raw sex and drugs consuming scene, But more importantly the movie actually reveals the real facts of wrestling and the behind scenes activities. We all know wrestling is a spectacle therefore not 100% real. But then again you don’t know until you really know and this movie will reveal almost all the details of the wrestling business, therefore MAYBE your son wont feel the same way the next time he sees wrestling.<br>  <br>  As far as the "kid that's 11 years old who is Absolutely crazy about WWE wrestling" This has nothing to do with the W.W.E. ...... You know Ring of Honor is much better that WWE. Give it a try.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you<br>  <br>  Guillermo Ramos<br>  A.R.M.Y <br>  E-4 Specialist<br>  .

Anime usually makes a series more dramatic by using effects, vocalists, and especially the fact that it's in color. The characters clothing are usually colored in the theme of the anime. The voices of female characters are usually higher pitched for characters around pre-teen or teenager aged. The male voices are in turn very lower except for younger aged children. <br>             Anime is also very popular for making amvs which are anime music videos. These videos are very popular and ppl tend to use programs ranging from windows movie maker to vegas pro. Another way that anime fans show their love is through anime conventions (anime con.) Fans tend to dress up in cosplay, expressing an anime character.  <br>  <br>  More info @ wiki:  Manga: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga</a><br>  Anime: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime</a>|`|Gslt7zcLaa	manga is the comic verison of anime like black and white versions.<br>  <br>  SHONEN JUMP IS GANGSTA<br>  <br>  anime is the moving tv version of manga but manga always comes first before watching the anime of the show.<br>  <br>  ADULT SWIM 1AM TO 5AM ON SATURDAY|`|3rOoXmTEaa	Well manga is prity much the anime in comic form<br>  <br>  and anime is well like a show  most animes are manga's first befor they become a show<br>  <br>  anime-animated<br>  <br>  manga-comic story|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Manga is comics<br>  <br>  Anime is animated shows|`|X45rxI7gaa	manga is comics<br>  anime is animation|`|PILm2U4Taa	Originally, "manga" meant comics, static drawn graphic novel or even newspaper comics.

xTioPxaVaa	Your question makes perfect sense, and is not dumb at all!<br>  <br>  If your tickets say "General Admission" or "Festival Seating" on them, then it's a free-for-all.  Get there early, get down front.<br>  <br>  If there's a row and seat number on the ticket, then it's reserved seating.  Although, if you're on the floor you're probably going to be standing during the whole show.<br>  <br>  The last general admission show I went to was Dethklok at the Austin Music Hall with my son.  We hung back on the floor, because neither one of us wanted to get caught in the mosh pit up (and people were leaving bloody afterwards).<br>  <br>  Personally now, I always try to get reserved seating in the mezzanine or balcony now.  With almost every band out there carrying video, you get to watch the whole show that way.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin,<br>  <br>  Ken<br>  <br>  BTW - where is the show at?  I've either seen or done shows at pretty much every hall in Texas!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I|`|BJERgbM5aa	Concerts are pure madness.  No one seems to be comfortable, but the entertainment usually out weighs the discomfort of being pushed, jostled, lost, stepped on, spilled on, etc.  Have fun.  ps: Don't go alone.  Always be with friends.|`|AA10182327	I'm guessing that it is in Texas from your name but yes, everyone will get General Seating which means standing room only. I would suggest if you like the mosh pit to arrive early as it is usually close to the stage and where the stage diving occurs but if you don't like the mosh pit, stay toward the back. <br>  Oh, and remember to bring ear plugs. It is loud.<br>  Good luck and have fun.|`|n54Z9nWXaa	yes everyone is packed together quite tightly. you barely have room to move lol. be prepared for some stink. one concert i went to some person didn't wear deodarant and it was bad! yuck!|`|Tt61Vp92aa	its a mad heard of people pushing , shoving and stepping on you.you wont end up in the same place you started
MEzanrqQaa	Feck all these stereotyped answers!<br>  <br>  A Leo is majorly misunderstood. A leo is probably the most likely sign to risk their life for a stranger's life. We would run into the middle of a busy road to save some old lady or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not all Leos are arrogant and proud! That is a stab in the back to any Leo to keep on saying that. Would all youz keep forgiving us if we kept on stating your bad traits first?<br>  Why is it always us who are stepped ona nd constantly forgive you damn numpteys!!!! <br>  <br>  Oh this is doing my head in!!! Aggghhhhhhhh<br>  <br>  <br>  Hahahahahaaa:.D Entertained:.D I was serious though. :.D<br>  <br>  Edit: DaMN them aaaalllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!|`|tfIwNKfkaa	Leos are like a lion right, they think they are the best, they are arrogant smug and stubborn. Leo is a fire sign so they can not handle the sensitiveness of the water signs pisces, they also are very generous, assertive and responsible. They go well with other leos, ariens and sagitarius.|`|oDdXpghDaa	From homostrology.com (a site for gay astrology - but still accurate for straight folks  lol)<br>  <br>  ******<br>  <br>  The Gay Leo: Who wouldn't want to be you?<br>  <br>  King of the Jungle?  Understatement.  Louis XIV built Versailles so that the sun would progress with him from morning into night.  Mistresses, lords, jesters, manicurists, haberdashers, horseman, chefs, and hangers-on orbited him like asteroids and applauded his every utterance.  That's more like it.  Sometimes it gets stressful, having so much delegating to do, but the perks are fabulous.  It's never lonely on top.  The glamour, the booze and, lest we forget, the boys, will have the rank and file in awe.  You know how it works, this social thing.  It's not rocket science, really.  Give 'em a good time.  Make 'em feel like they're with you on the top of the food chain, and they shall come.  There's really nothing you can do about it.  Kings need attention like Brittney Spears needs the paparazzi. <br>  <br>  All this lavish entertainment is going to take money, of course.  Good thing you like to lead in business as well as pleasure.  You've got a hankering for the corner office, if only because it gets good light and will allow you to show off your vintage modernist furniture to its best advantage.  Call it expensive, call it snotty, but under no circumstances call it Ikea.  You know the best; that's why you're such a good boss.  You can motivate a team with your compliments and encouragement.  And you're totally comfortable as the bold entrepreneur, the one who gets a brilliant flash of inspiration and then calls the admins into his office to say "I'll need the details worked out by Monday."  You're more of a vision guy than a corporate cog, though you work pretty hard at it.  I'd remind you to stick to a strict regimen of beauty-sleep, facials and massages, but you don't need too much encouragment. <br>  <br>  You're taste for the finer things in life is probably going to command a lot of your money and time... How do I put this?  I know the words "label whore" sound harsh, but brace yourself: label whore.  Yes, you.  Whatever, you love it.  How else would they recognize your majesty, now that capes and scepters have gone out of style?  Royalty needs to look the part.  Besides, you only like the big names because they make the best rags.  It's not the label you're after so much as a guarantee that the fabric and cut are going to be just right.  In this era of the tailored suit, that's not a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Lesser mortals may ask who died and made you Hillary Clinton.  And if they do, please avoid sulking.  It's so unattractive.  In fact, you might want to take the drastic step of thinking about why a body would say such a thing.  Think back.  Last time you were out, did you feel the need to lecture about your one pet peeve in this world, men with over-shaped eyebrows?  Or your other one pet peeve, the men who love them?  Maybe it's the Log Cabin Republicans who really get your goat.  Maybe your lecture is directed at a friend who foolishly called his bar crush the very next day.  I know, I know, but show some restraint.  As the Kristal flows, so does your stream of eloquence.  You lecture because you love.  You lecture because you yourself know better.  And when you've finished, hopefully you'll still have some friends left.  Since you're going to pick up the tab, it's entirely likely.  But watch it, Leo.  Even if you are right, and I concede that you frequently are, nobody likes a know-it-all.  Show a little humility, and for heaven's sake, give your friends some credit for being the gorgeous, intelligent, creative people they are.  After all, you don't hang out with just anybody.  These people are special to you for a reason. <br>  <br>  Different people show love in different ways.  You know, strokes, folks, and all of that.  For you, love and gifts go hand and hand: the expensive bag, the helpful business contact, the lavish compliment.  You love to do it and they love to receive it.  Just make sure that you're not trading stuff for affection.  Learn to take a little criticism from the people who love you.  Since you're not exactly what some folks would call approachable, you'll know they're speaking up because they care.  Do you really want a pack of yes-men following your around, flattering you and doing whatever you ask?  Don't answer that.|`|V20PTwMmaa	Your boring me.|`|plBXp91Daa	Arrogant and we are fun like to entertain people.<br>  Love center of attention (not all Leo's but mostly does like it)<br>  We love luxury.Always there for friends & family if they need help. Big heart. Strong.

There was also dug outs and and soldiers always went over the top.

lpyWVR2oaa	Because you're a good blend of all the elements, you may find yourself being attracted to various types of men throughout your life. <br>  <br>  But based on the strongest indicators in your chart, your chart rulers - Mars and Pluto - are found in Aries and Scorpio each. Mars and Venus are indicators of the type of men you're attracted to and how you behave when you go into 'flirt' mode so when these 2 are found in the fiery sign of Aries, you tend to gravitate towards those self-assertive confident initiative types who are risk-takers and courageous. <br>  <br>  Since Mars is the co-ruler of Scorpio PLUS you also have Scorpio Rising, you could very well be attracted to the introverted powerful types as well as manifested by the Scorpio personality. Both Aries and Scorpio have this common trait between them and that is, plenty of DRIVE. You definitely like the go-getter, determined kind.<br>  <br>  Also, since you have the Moon in Capricorn, another type u might want to consider is the Capricorn Sun sign - or any other Earth signs. They will instinctively understand you need for emotional and financial security and are willing to earn your trust.<br>  <br>  With a Scorpio Sun//Aqu Rising, this is the classic case of deep attraction at first sight. Because both your Rising signs reflect whom the other is like at the innermost core level, there is an intuitive unspoken understanding between you two where social mannerisms, behavior and inner goals/drive are concerned. For even better compatibility, look to his Moon, Venus and Mars signs, which will reveal how u two interact emotionally (Moon) and sexually (Mars/Venus).|`|tcvQwTa5aa	I have a book that says that Aquarius cannot put up with Scorpio for very long but it also says that more is needed to make the compatability determination than the sun signs alone.Llewellyn worldwide sells charts for about 20 bucks.I've bought one from them before.Try to find them on the web.Usually,signs are most compatable with signs in the same category,such as fire with fire,water with water,etc.but as they say opposites attract as well.There's this interesting little book I have called:Signs of Love by Jeraldine Saunders that you can get from Llewellyn publications that is very informative as to compatability of signs.I also contains numerology,palmistry,colors,facial features,auric vibration,etc.It's a pretty neat little book.It cost me $6.99.Check it out.|`|gEnFE6U9aa	you're attracted to whoever you feel attraction.

Why must the blame always be placed on a woman. You should have asked, "What is wrong with this young man that he lashed out so viciously at his girlfriend?" I am so sick of this herpes rumor. Again, it is an attempt to JUSTIFY the beating of a woman. If that was true, why would Chris Brown have gone to an awards show with Rihanna moments before the attack? Someone created this stupid rumor to justify Chris' attack. It appears that the truth is that the couple had broken up the week before then reunited for the awards show. Chris got a text from a woman and reportedly had been cheating on Rihanna. He has witnessed violence in his childhood and clearly needs counseling and some jail time. Please stop this senseless rumor of her having a venereal disease. It is really sick and disgusting. Mostly it is females who are jealous of Rihanna's beauty and fame that are repeating this nonsense.|`|pDptioSNaa	Your smileys have no place in this kind of topic.|`|otYTWy2uaa	I don't care what transpired between the two no man has any right to hit a woman ever.|`|BqZ4MInTaa	No one knows for sure.

But I find that the media is blowing this out of proportion. There are men who catch their spouse on fire with gasoline. They are horribly disfigured and they only go to jail for 18 months. This stuff happens to lots of people, and some of them get killed. Yes I do think it is wrong, but I think they are making to big of a deal about it. Like when John Travolta's son died from a seizure. They were like "Oh my gosh, he died from a seizure" meanwhile two years ago, my nephew died from a seizure (thank goodness someone performed CPR on him) and was brought back to life. The hospital told my sister that no one can die from a seizure. And when that son thing happened, my sister was pissed. They could of been studying this, and his son could still be alive today. So that is what I mean about the media blowing things out of proportion meanwhile people go through this things all of the time.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Of course.

I know two born again Christians, and they are great people.........and I would never utter a harsh word against them.......but I don't agree with their religious beliefs.   But I respect that they believe it all, and lead their lives accordingly, in a very Christ like way....which I respect immensely. <br>  <br>  I would never try to argue my views with them,  because I see how important their views are to them.........and there is nothing to say I would win, or convince them of otherwise.

a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Lust is just a deep physical attraction to someone with no lasting value. It's exciting to people that aren't looking for any thing but physical pleasure. Love on the other hand is the whole package and very hard to describe except for the usual way of deep emotional feeling. You can of course lust for the one you love|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	love is the deep care and emotional feeling for someone-you can't live without them, you care about them deeply-it's not really something you can explain. love is amazing i imagine [never had romantic love yet]  love may be better b/c you know there's someoen else who loves you too, lust may be exciting b/c it's physical but i'd much rather love|`|1K18ipdiaa	Love- someone you may or may not have met laying down their life for you. <br>  <br>  lust- greed, covetness<br>  <br>  Love, true "agape" love, for some may not seem more "exciting", but to an awakened conscience, lust cannot fulfill the need for love.<br>   English  language isnot capable of defining love truly. Greek or hebrew can describe better. Agape is the unconditinal, philia is brotherly/friendly love, eros is sensual love. <br>  Lust is quick, doesnt last long, and leaves you wanting more. Greed blinds a man's eyes.|`|NArvUE9daa	Love can become more like being unselfish, caring, loyal, romantic; while lust between people can hit benefit friends and intimate encounters, and can be aggressive and only in for itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can be in love with someone; you can love someone.<br>  I'll answer on being in love : p<br>  Love can mean truly enjoying yourself and sharing cutesy/romantic things with someone you adore. It gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling. You love spending time with this person and hold each other up. You love to hear that person's voice, see their smile, be around their cologne/perfume, and look forward to being around that person.    It hurts to be apart from that person. You feel more complete and sure about yourself; and it's like having another soul alongside you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lust alone may be more exciting as it doesn't leave scars that a broken relationship formed with love would- you meet someone just to play around; no complications or worries about relationships. Maybe you even just eye something and think 'I want to tap that.'<br>  You're not that person's boyfriend/girlfriend at all; and that's perfect for a lust relationship. No heartbreaks.<br>  <br>  Love can have desire; which is not the same as lust.|`|G3ahqvmqaa	lust is sexual attraction/cravings/desire towards another/ to want someone because of his/her phisical appearance<br>  <br>  love is difficult to define but can be described as a strong feeling of affection/ deep, ineffable feeling of tenderly care for another person and  unconditionally acceptance.<br>  <br>  Both are exciting but lust is temporary and only one sided(to crave to filfill wat u u feel). so u choose|`|Sb8kB0t0aa	lust is basically just an attraction.<br>  love is, well you know, LOVE<br>  haha.<br>  but love is more exciting cuz it's the real thing<br>  like i said, lust is just an attraction

So, I assume that you are balding and you are a little worried. Don't be, there are many girls that like balding men.<br>  Tastes are different so I think that there are many girls who would say Yes and many who would say No.<br>  I don't think that this is a problem. I for one wouldn't date a balding man for different reasons, but most because it's not my type.|`|AA11656721	If I were not married, and had to find someone, as long as the person was good to me, bald or not I would date him.  Looks are a plus, but good looks don't not make the person respectable, trust worthy, honest, loving, kind, hard working and fun.  It's whats inside the persons heart that makes the person truly attractive.|`|CIhpkxGyaa	depends on his age<br>  <br>  if he's 20 and losing his hair, he better have a damn good looking face<br>  <br>  if he's older then yes|`|eTOrwG1Maa	Of course.  I love bald heads!  But he's got to have a good personality.  That's the most important part, of course!|`|Up6ANLQeaa	It wouldn't bother me....some of the hottest guys are bald!|`|XwFGg5wPaa	yes if he had a great personality|`|14A10JcLaa	<------------Help|`|K2QwEM4raa	Sure if I liked him!

I would love if you e-mailed me and told me what it's all about. (kinda have an idea from commercials) BUT if it's REALLY worth it, I'll make a greater effort to get to in on time.<br>  <br>  Now I'm intrigued by your enthusiasm, so Yeah, I'm gonna rush home to get to it.<br>  <br>  Thanks & Take Care !!!<br>  <br>  _________  ~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|f9soMMuiaa	Bad plot, script and dialogues. Cancel after 5-6 episodes. Maybe Whedon should focus on reviving Firefly or do some fantasy sci fi series instead of this. I've had it with Dushku in these same old roles.|`|AA10954273	I watched the pilot and was frankly appalled.  I'm shocked that someone like Joss Whedon would produce something so awful and exploitative.  However, he reportedly had to film a completely new pilot because Fox didn't like the one he originally did.  So I'll give it another chance.  It can't get any worse.  Still, the ratings for the first episode were abysmally low, and traditionally the first episode gets the highest ratings due to people checking it out.  If this happens with Dollhouse, it may not last more than 3-5 episodes.
QSUg9vNLaa	no, shes so popular because all of her songs ( and i mean ALL of her songs) relate to teen girls, how they love a boy, the boy breaks up with them, and then gos out with another girl. shes basically saying what all of us teen girls are feeling. Sure, shes pretty. Thats a bonus though. shes also a good role model, much better than miley ( in my opinion)|`|6VC9BLIsaa	wow... wow... jealous much???? if it was just based on her looks, or if popularity is just based on looks.. then wouldnt there be a lot other famous people... taylors got talent man have you ever listen to any of her songs.. the music, the lyrics, her voice... she writes and plays it all herself... man and if you need proof that she deserves it watch her video from the grammys... the best part is she used to just be a regular girl... sure the looks add to her success but its all about the talent... a pretty girl is a pretty girl but a girl with talent can do anything..<br>  <br>  and music similar to hers???? you cant compare different artists songs<br>  <br>  what kind of music are you listening to??? all that rap crap??? thats just talking to a beat.... she writes real music|`|3LhwoBPDaa	Exactly. Even though I don't want to admit it, I think she's drop dead gorgeous and don't know how she got bullied in high school. Maybe the girls were jealous? But don't looks rule in this society? Anyway, I like Colbie Cailat better.<br>  <br>  She's blonde, blue-eyed, the picture of the girl next door image...|`|wjkTzT2jaa	<a href="http://answersall.yim.cn" rel="nofollow">http://answersall.yim.cn</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|LMfstsxWaa	i don't think she's talented at all.<br>  she sucks, people make her a big deal because her age.<br>  they believe she'll be the next leann rymes but she really sucks.<br>  the lyrics are okaaaay but her singing...horifying.|`|l3RG5rtgaa	no. she has talent. its not her fault she looks like that.<br>  taylor swift is a good singer. thats why people like her|`|88HhRgZ4aa	Thats showbiz baby!|`|mYxvDgVxaa	She writes her own music and so many people can relate to it, and that's why they buy it and its catchy!<br>  I agree though if she was less decent looking she wouldn't be as famous.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	i don't think she can really sing that much and where did she come from?|`|L2MoTyT7aa	I agree with you. I think her looks have help propel her into stardom. I also think it's the fact that even though shes young she's had a rather important career. And even though she's young, she does write her own songs and they aren't bad. I think people just enjoy a good rags to riches story.|`|iHVU9Ffpaa	well, she writes her own music and plays guitar in concerts but it does seem like most famous teens are blondes, and pretty so i would say that part of her being famous is her looks|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	She is talented and she is beautiful... she got the greatest songs like one of the best love story... she is really great!|`|uH28xTcbaa	well she has talent and she is pretty<br>  so what? are you jealous of her?

b30ebd51a705432ff85d083b2d05aea7aa	The blueprint for "...Bollocks.." was the LP "Spunk"..supposedly far superior to the authorised release. It's a boot that is fairly available still. McClaren's 'puppets' certainly got away from him..Lyndon has led a carreer far from what he ever imagined I'll bet.Good luck to him.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Publicity stunt.|`|f279e76fb473e663c0561d5e2597318baa	They called the Rock N' Roll museum that because they felt that it wasn't showcasing rock in the right way. They said that Rock N' Roll being in a museum relates to rock being dead. Also, the reason why only one studio album was made is because the original line-up split up befoe they started making another album.|`|kvP6bAySaa	They only did one album because they didn't last long enough to do any more!<br>  <br>  Malcolm McClaren basically ripped the band off, and at the time the only one who could see it was John Lydon.  With Lydon leaving (Never Mind the Bollocks was released in 77, Lydon had already formed PiL in 78) and Sid Vicious (who couldn't play anyway) either arrested or dead, there wasn't really a band left to continue.<br>  <br>  Actually a very good band though, and it is quite untrue that they "couldn't play".  If you listen to any of their material it was all perfectly in tune.  Steve Jones in particular was an excellent guitarist.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	everything the sex pistols did was just to get attention and try and seem sooo rebellious,when really they ended up looking like spoiled little brats. they didn't last long because they were basically rubbish and there were much better punk bands that went on to last much longer,but for some reason it's the sex pistols that everyone raves about.|`|hGVkInSnaa	Because it is one.

They also ensure the crowd's safety, if someone crowdsurfs to the front, they'll pick them out the crowd when they get to the front and if they see someone at the front of the crowd get injured or pass out 'cos it's so crushed, they will try get them out too.

aLZoP73Laa	This is absolutely obsurd!!!! Yes I sympathise with Jade Goody, Jack and particularly her two young boys, BUT, just because she is a celebrity, it doesn't mean that they should be granted special rights!!! He has commited a crime and he should pay for what he done.<br>  <br>  If someone had murdered a person for example, would they be allowed to leave prison - no!! I know the circumstances are entirely different, but the theory is the same. He is being given privilegdes because his wife, NOT HIM, is famous!!!!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	I'm absolutely furious. People die of terminal illnesses every week, does it mean we should release prisoners just to be by their bedside? This is a privilege that a lot of the victims family didn't have. I know the nature of his crime is different, but you shouldn't make an exception for her.. it's not like she discovered a cure for HIV or has done something extremely wonderful for the humanity to return her the favour by releasing, tag or untagged that gold digger! It's outrageous.. a lot of cancer patients go through hell without the help of the government, in spite of writing to them and begging them for medicine, when they should be making most of their last days.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	I think actually that if the partner had only days to live then the same would possibly be granted.<br>  He also has not had his tag removed, he has just had his curfew made longer. He only had to be at his mums house after 7pm in the evening. He is now allowed to spend his wedding night with Jade and only has to be home for 3pm the next day.|`|52pZj3WFaa	It disgusts me.<br>  <br>  This whole thing disgusts me and it is just like the Emperor's New Clothes. What we think we are seeing is NOT what we are seeing, and I refuse to let myself be manipulated.<br>  <br>  This whole thing reeks of favourtism and media pressure. Media pressure on the law of the land. This situation has created a new precedent for other violent chavs to have their sentences quashed, altered, shortened for the sake of, well, whatever they feel like.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	of course it does not happen for every one else but most people die with dignity she is turning this into a circus lots of people die of this horrible disease that we will never know but she is plastered all over the news and he wants to marry her so bad don't suppose hes even thought of the money that will be left to him as her hubby when she dies.|`|iaHM24Xjaa	Well i agree to some extent, but on the other hand these are exceptional circumstances which allow for some bending of the rules. <br>  I'm sure if you were put in the same situation you would want to spend your wedding day with you newly wed. <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|3f21c30b3424532b28fd9578258f69d9aa	Shocking !!  What happened to Gorodn Browns speech - lets do away with Celebrity in Government ......

Gordon Brown !!  maybe it will be Ronnie Bigg's..better still what about Osama Bin Laden..|`|HDZyPMMJaa	i agree i love jade and feel sorry for her so much BUT what about the boy he hit... its wrong it sends ot the wrong message|`|u2EUom6daa	ARE YOU FOR REAL<br>  <br>  i don't think it is common for someone who only has weeks left to live wants to get married asap to someone who is tagged and on bail conditions<br>  from the news today they were not going to let Jack spend his wedding night with Jade and she was in a bit of a state finding this out and Jack Straw got involved and now he is allowed to spend his wedding night with her (his bail conditions were he has to spend every night at his mothers house)<br>  <br>  and how would you know if this would not happen to normal people as if it did i don't think there would be any media attention, how many people a year die from cancer and you don't see these people in the news almost every day leading up to there death and why because they are not a celebrity so it might of happened loads of times but if you don't know the people how are you going to find out about it?|`|Ke9cILe6aa	I am very angry about the whole thing! This is totally wrong and the prison service and Home Office should be thoroughly ashamed. <br>  <br>  This whole thing has become a media farce and there should now be a total ban on media coverage.<br>  <br>  All you morons who support this shite should also be ashamed. People suffer from cancer everyday and they need to rely on the wonder Macmillan nurses and the like and yet they get no special privileges for their loved ones like this talentless trog has done!<br>  <br>  I am sickened by the whole thing.|`|snQvwEO9aa	Yeh i agree!<br>  Every1 is feels so sorry for Jade for some reason, yet millions of people have gone through the exact same thing, and some even worse...<br>  Basically she is a kinda "celebrity," so she gets let off, but thats life i suppose! Big brother is God apparently...<br>  :)|`|7KvzDwwXaa	I think that u are nasty and dont have a heart.

I dont know if it's because of Jade's high profile status, but i like to think anyone else under these devastating circumstances would also be allowed the same right. She doesn't have much time left so I'm glad they've allowed her her dream ending to her dream wedding, under awful circumstances.<br>  EDIT: My husband just reminded me of the instance of his old schoolfriend who was dying from breast cancer. Her partner had recently been released from prison on tag after commiting robbery. His curfew was relaxed, and he was allowed his wedding night with her, so obviously special cases DO count. They certainly weren't famous. She died less than a month later. This was 9 months ago.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	I agree with you..This should be done for everyone with special circumstances,not just for jack ,its like you say its one rule for one and different for everyone else.However i think spending their wedding night together is very important to both of them,as she has little time left.I do feel for jade,and i wish her well with her wedding and the time she has left.<br>  its a shame though that everyone does not get this chance,with bending the rules,when they have special circumstances,too.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	How the hell do you know?<br>  Jade is in the public eye so of course we hear about Jack etc and tag removal.<br>  If all we know this may well happen to other people like you and me but that wont be made public knowledge as we are not considered to be celebrities like Jade is.<br>  <br>  Stop the poison dwarfing and just be pleased that this dying woman will have one night with her husband. FFS!!!!!|`|bNllesmMaa	It's how life rolls, pretty unfair the way things happen and rules are made.<br>  <br>  But don't get too annoyed over this, you are not dying and you get to live your life.<br>  <br>  Things will always be unfair, just like it was unfair that Jade became a statistic and now dying with cervical cancer.

The others just looked cheesy doing Bond. Sean was Bond!|`|IzCCoKNoaa	Sir Sean Connery has been voted the best ever James Bond. <br>  <br>  <br>  The legendary Scottish actor - who played the original 007 in the 1962 film 'Dr No' - topped the poll to find the most popular portrayal of the suave MI6 spy, conducted by adventure-gift company Red Letter Days.<br>  <br>  Sir Roger Moore - who starred in seven films, including the 1974 classic 'The Man With The Golden Gun' - was runner-up in second place, while Pierce Brosnan - who was recently replaced as the secret agent by Daniel Craig - came third.<br>  <br>  Over 3,000 Bond fans also voted actress Ursula Andress as the Best Bond Girl for her iconic performance as Honey Ryder in 'Dr No', with Honor Blackman and Halle Berry making second and third place respectively for their roles in 'Goldfinger' and 'Die Another Day'.<br>  <br>  The 1964 film 'Goldfinger' - starring Connery - was named as the Best Bond Film. Moore's 1973 adventure 'Live and Let Die' was voted the second best and Brosnan's 2002 movie 'Die Another Day' rounded off the top three.<br>  <br>  Over half the voters also gave their support to latest Bond actor Craig, who makes his debut in 'Casino Royale' this month.<br>  <br>  Red Letter Days spokesman Andrea Aird said: "It goes to show just how much Bond films are seen as a British institution and a huge part of film history."<br>  <br>  <br>  Best Bond:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Sir Sean Connery<br>  <br>  2 Sir Roger Moore<br>  <br>  3 Pierce Brosnan<br>  <br>  <br>  Best Girl:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in 'Dr No'<br>  <br>  2 Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore in 'Goldfinger'<br>  <br>  3 Halle Berry as Jinx Johnson in 'Die Another Day'<br>  <br>  <br>  Best Film:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 'Goldfinger'<br>  <br>  2 'Live and Let Die'<br>  <br>  3 'Die Another Day'|`|hqfH47tHaa	Sean Connery definitely WAS NOT the best for me but then again I only watched his 1st Bond film...He also DEFINITELY was NOT the smoothes talking and "sexiest" Bond as the Connery-aholics here are claiming that trophy should go to Roger Moore cause he WAS the better Bond..many people don't know that he was actually the 1st actor approached to play Bond but didn't!..Just cause Connery ended up playing him 1st that DOES NOT make him the best...cause he sure as hell wasn't!|`|ba52jQHyaa	He was the first and he defined the part on the screen.  Of all the Bond actors I think Connery is the classiest.  He was smooth and charming.  He carried himself with confidence, but not arrogance.<br>  <br>  Just the same the issues of te best Bond is up for debate and it's really a matter of personal preference.  I kind of lean towards Dalton's dark Bond myself.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	IMO, Sean WAS the best bond ever. The look, the accent. It probably helps that he was the 1st bond. All the others, through no fault of their own, just couldn't live up to what Sean did.

Some sources, specifically Albert R. Broccoli from his autobiography When The Snow Melts, claim that Moore was considered for Dr. No, and that he was Ian Fleming's favorite for the role after apparently having seen Moore as Simon Templar in The Saint; however, the series did not begin airing in the United Kingdom until October 4, 1962  – one day before the premiere of Dr. No, although it's possible that the show began filming before or around the film.<br>  <br>  Other sources, such as the commentary for the special edition DVDs, claim that Moore was passed over for Bond in favour of someone who was older. As Moore is older than Sean Connery, this is probably not true. Publicly, Moore was not linked to the role of 007 until 1967, when Harry Saltzman claimed he would make a good Bond, but also displayed misgivings owing to his popularity as Simon Templar. Nevertheless, Moore was finally cast as James Bond in Live and Let Die (1973).<br>  <br>  Roger Moore's twelve years as Simon Templar earned him enough popularity (and credibility) among fans of detective fiction to earn many Bond fans' acceptance, despite the inevitable comparisons to Connery. Moore played Bond in Live and Let Die (1973); The Man with the Golden Gun (1974); The Spy Who Loved Me (1977); Moonraker (1979); For Your Eyes Only (1981); Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985)<br>  <br>  To date, Moore is the longest-serving James Bond actor, having spent twelve years in the role (from his debut in 1973, to his retirement from the role in 1985), and made seven official films. (Connery also made seven, but his last Bond film, Never Say Never Again (1983), was not originally part of the official EON Productions series.) He is also the oldest actor to play Bond: he was 45 when he debuted, and 58 when he announced his retirement on December 3, 1985, as it was agreed by all involved that Moore was too old for the role by that point (he had actually tried to leave the role after For Your Eyes Only). Moore himself was quoted in the contemporary press as saying that he felt embarrassed to be seen making love scenes with beautiful actresses who were young enough to be his daughters.<br>  <br>  Moore's James Bond was light-hearted, more so than any other official actor to portray the character. Connery's style, even in its lighter moments, was that of a focused, determined agent. Moore often portrayed 007 as somewhat of a playboy, with tongue firmly in cheek, but also as a very capable and seasoned detective. The humour served Moore and his fans well through most of his Bond tenure.<br>  <br>  Although often considered a 'lightweight', owing to never having had a significant stage career or having appeared in serious dramas, Moore can boast a dramatic education at RADA, the prestigious London drama college. However, Moore only attended for six months in 1945. In 2004, Moore was voted 'Best Bond' in a poll and won with a large 62% of votes whilst in late 2008, he also topped another poll on moviefans.com beating new Bond star Daniel Craig with 56% of votes.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Why not?   He was still believable in the role despite his age, and I would have preferred he stayed on a few more years rather than bringing on Timothy Dalton.

Karin and Kiriya embark on a romantic journey despite Karin's classmate Yuka's best efforts to sabotage their relationship, but Karin soon learns that living happily ever after isn't on the curriculum when she becomes Kiriya's center of attention, as well as embittered Yuka's bull's-eye on her dartboard of hate."<br>  you can read the manga there!<br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/series/46/kare_first_love/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...</a>|`|3rOoXmTEaa	Do you have a picture of it?|`|2febfRmuaa	oh yeah! that's a manga and its called kare first love! my God that manga was so beautiful...

Goodbye.|`|Kuftcunaaa	THERE may be a glimmer of hope for "Lipstick Jungle" fans, after all.<br>  <br>  The show "has not been officially canceled," NBC exec Angela Bromstad told The Post last night. "We have not struck the set."<br>  <br>  But Bromstadt, who was head of NBC Universal Television Studios when the show was developed, admits "it was just not broad enough in the ratings" and won't likely have a future with the network.<br>  <br>  "I think there are alternatives we may look at for [the show]," she says.<br>  <br>  Those avenues could include Brooke Shields and her co-stars ending up on NBC's cable sister, Bravo network, or even be shopped to Lifetime.<br>  <br>  There is also the possibility that "Jungle" could resurface in a less traditional venue like DirecTV's 101 network - which recently aired original episodes of "Friday Night Lights."<br>  <br>  "That would be a way in which you could preserve that show," she says.<br>  <br>  So far, "we have not struck the set," Bromstadt says. "But everybody is a professional and everyone knows the reality."<br>  <br>  Bromstadt's comments seem to back Shields, who's claimed since last fall - when news broke that "Jungle" was in danger - that it was never officially canceled, despite reports to the contrary.<br>  <br>  The show, which premiered last season, stars Shields, Lindsey Price and Kim Raver as high-powered friends living and loving in Manhattan.<br>  <br>  It premiered opposite a similar ABC show, "Cashmere Mafia," which was canned after one season.|`|Rn5Xcs7paa	im almost positive the show is cancelled.<br>  sorry!<br>  <br>  google it and im sure you'll find more information.|`|FJG0Urx6aa	mmmmmmmmmmm

qThmcR1Aaa	Enigma's album "The Screen Behind the Mirror" is entirely built around Orff's "Carmina Burana."<br>  <br>  The Art of Noise track "Dilemma" also samples a bit of "Carmina Burana."<br>  <br>  Emerson, Lake & Powell and King Crimson have both done renditions of Holst's "Mars, the Bringer of War."<br>  <br>  Emerson, Lake & Palmer have done all kinds of covers of classical pieces: "Pictures at an Exhibition" (the whole thing), Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man" and "Hoedown," Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet," and the fourth movement of Ginastera's Piano Concerto No. 1 (which they called "Toccata"). There's probably more, but that's all I can think of now.<br>  <br>  Three of Yes's keyboardists have incorporated snippets of classical pieces into their performances: Rick Wakeman on "Excerpts From 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII," where he included a bit of the "Hallelujah Chorus"; Tony Kaye on "SI," where he included the opening flourish from Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor; and Geoff Downes, where he included a bit of the toccata from Widor's Organ Symphony No. 5 in the Yes song "Machine Messiah."<br>  <br>  A violinist named Vanessa-Mae did a pop rendition of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, but what she called her version escapes me. You can probably find it on YouTube.<br>  <br>  In the '70s, Apollo 100 did a tune called "Joy," based on Bach's "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring."<br>  <br>  And I remember in the '80s, there was a series called "Hooked on Classics," which basically created medleys of popular classical works and set them to an electronic drumbeat. Odd, but there you go.<br>  <br>  There's probably more, but that's all I can think of right now.|`|489c4df66d3b2c8fdc7225ad28fe7b64aa	some examples from recent years (after 2000)<br>  <br>  William Orbit (Trance music)<br>  - Barber's Adagio for Strings<br>  - Xerxes (Ombra mai fu from Haendel's Xerxes)<br>  - Ravel's Pavane pour une Infante Defunte<br>  - L'inverno (Winter 2nd movement from Vivaldi's Four Seasons)<br>  - Intermezzo from Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana<br>  - Opus 132 (from Beethoven's String quartet no.15 in A minor, op.132)<br>  <br>  Rollerball - Albinoni (Adagio in G minor by Albinoni)<br>  Yamakasi - The secret Garden (Ase's Death from Peer Gynt by Grieg)<br>  Aria - Dido (Dido's Lament from Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas)<br>  Jan Vayne - Welcome To A New World (from Dvorak's symphony no. 9)<br>  Jan Vayne - Pictures (from Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition)<br>  Rank 1 - Sensation White Anthem 2003 (Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem)<br>  Sensation White Anthem 2004 (O Fortuna from Orff's Carmina Burana)<br>  <br>  <br>  Classical pieces in Rock music (as far as not mentioned in the response above)<br>  - Yngwie Malmsteen plays Classical (Air on a G string by Bach, 5th symphony 1st mvt. by Beethoven, Adagio in G by Albinoni ....)<br>  - Jethro Tull - Bourée 1969 (Bourée from Suite for Lute BWV 996 by Bach)<br>  - The Nice - Ars longa Vita brevis 1968 (the Nice, former group of/with Keith Emerson playing Intermezzo from Karelia Suite by Sibelius, Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 by Bach and Tchaikovsky)<br>  - Emerson, Lake & Palmer - The Barbarian 1971 (Allegro Barbaro by Bela Bartok)<br>  - Emerson, Lake & Palmer - Nutrocker 1972 (March from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite)|`|xcPzZvsraa	"Symphony in X Major" by Xzibit (feat.Dr Dre) uses part of J.S Bach's 3rd Brandenburg Concerto.<br>  <br>  "Coming 2 America" by Ludacris uses the Dies irae theme from Mozart's Requiem Mass in D plus I think a little bit of Dvorak's 9th Symphony.<br>  <br>  They are the only two I can think of besides the Naz which you mention which I believe is a rip of Beethoven's "Fur Elise " piano bagatelle.

zukR6mOvaa	i dont agree with him.<br>  He is not the only one who had faced difficult times. he is just punishing innocent people who were not responsible for the situation he was faced with. killing everyone will surely bring peace, because there will be no one left to fight. but thats definetly not a solution. its like killing all the tigers just because one of them killed a human. its illogical.<br>  but its what u expect from pain. his character was created as an opposite of naruto's beliefs. they both have similar backgrounds but they both responded in a different way. (as seen in naruto and gaara)|`|DIjL6Tuvaa	I don't agree with him at all. What he says doesn't make any real sense. The only way to get peace is through murder and destruction? I don't think so. I also don't see how he's breaking the chain of revenge. After all, what he's doing is just a grand scale revenge on the world. So those who can't fight will live in fear and instability, while the strong ones will just go on seeking violence and revenge (just like Pein is). It's stupid. I also don't know why Naruto didn't have an answer for him, since he's already managed to bring peace through friendship (as with Gaara for example).|`|zpCEI8xvaa	The only one agrees with him are ultra emos, Red Sox fans, an heroes, and members of his fanbase.<br>  <br>  If he think what he went through is bad he should go to 3rd world countries, people there had it worse than him.|`|btFSgJmlaa	No. <br>  <br>  Nagato's a whip putting the blame somewhere else.|`|u5eHNj0taa	I think it's interesting.

DJbEN5oyaa	Mommy1234 you are correct as Kate did say"Our life is our show and the show is our life" very telling I'd say. Jon used to work as an IT Technician, but as he said in the 2nd question and answer show he now stays at home. They need to change shows opening to reflect what Jon himself has said.<br>  <br>   I read on a blog they had already gotten rid of the two dogs as one kids allergic to the animal fur.<br>  Thank goodness as I cant see them taking care of two dogs and Kate would always be screaming about dog poo in her 1.3 million dollar home.<br>  <br>  I kinda was thinking why do they need a dog when Kate treats Jon like one?<br>  <br>  Did you know that Kate also said {She reminds me of Octomom in many ways} in an interview she gave to the Associated Press May 8, 2005 titled ..Mother Of Sextuplets Faces Loss Of Medicaid-Funded Nurse. Kate  is quoted as saying:she feels society has a responsibility to help with the children, since modern medicine promotes the use of fertility drugs, which can lead to multiple births.<br>  <br>  You can always google the interview.<br>  <br>  I'm glad the dogs are gone.<br>  <br>  Sleepy may be right as there sure are a lot recent pictures of Jon drunk and without Kate & 8 on the web.|`|k0qTaSceaa	I think its dumbb but will be intresting<br>  i know at the end of the show she will return the dogs back because who in their right minds brings in 2 puppies in a house with 8 kids. puppies need attention and training as well. kids in attention too so it just wouldnt work out i know for a FACT she will bring them back or bring them to the shelter!! which sucks because it will show people oh when you cant handl a dog just giv them away dont worry they are not a lifetime responsiblity and they got german shepards those are pretty big dogs when full grown and thats alot of hair i dont think kate will be too fond of that. n i remember jon and kate talking about how kate wants a small dog and jon wanted a big dog but they wanted it in the future when the kids were older so i think this is jus a stunt to pull.<br>  <br>  but yta this is what i think<br>  and yess i feel bad for the pooor puppies too<br>  <br>  <br>  plus do jon and kate even know anything about dogs?????|`|Gn5LmqoNaa	First of all Jon DOES work. If you watch every episode he is away all day then comes home at night. Kate was a nurse but is off now with the kids. The show is not their job.<br>  <br>  And ya I agree. I can't believe they got 2 huge puppies. I can't imagine how awful that would be with them pooping and peeing all over the house PLUS 6 Four Year olds and 2 Eight year olds. Also with Kate being a neat freak.<br>  I have one small Shih Tzu and my mom freaks about the pee and poop as she is a puppy and she isn't nearly as bad at Kate.|`|ppL5clgQaa	They're seriously getting puppies!<br>  I thought I heard Kate say they would never get pets!<br>  But yeah I feel sorry for the puppies too! And for John and Kate!<br>  They're going to have to put up with 2 puppies AND 8 other children!!!<br>  That's alot!!!<br>  I seriously hope that they DONT get ANY pets!|`|byPJFZWuaa	They are also presently seperated and are most likely getting a divorce.  They are living off the money from the show and thats all they have.<br>  <br>  My friend lives near them and they are now BOTH unemployed and yes living off the show.|`|r7Y9mPS1aa	not good they finally get some quiet and their getting puppies omg. <br>  but the kids will love them.  <br>  i hope those dogs are strong so they dont get hurt with 8 kids attacking them.|`|UriE3wN6aa	HAHAHA this show is def. gonna start getting more interesting lol|`|CpzlUpEnaa	Geez, Puppies now? after 8 kids.<br>  I would never think of getting a pet.|`|f31fac4f3be7141334887486f8dcf112aa	i would wait till they was at least 12 yrs old and that age now they not gonna walk and take care of the puppies maybe 4 a week but they could get tired of that very quickly|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i feel sorry for the puppies for having to put up with that lunatic kate|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Poor Jon that's all I can say. He has to take care of 8 children, the property, 2 German Shepherds which by the way are like giant rats, they chew everything in sight AND put up with Kate who has turned into a nagging housewife. The way she went on one day about him not using a coupon and berates and belittles him in the interviews. I don't see how he puts up with her mouth.|`|Leda2ha0aa	Well they're German Shepherds which are terrific dogs, but Kate has no idea what she is getting herself into.  She likes things clean, but with puppies it won't be that way for long.  One puppy would be more than enough but it would probably be "loved on" by 8 kids way too much so they got a second as not to make one go bonkers.  I think it's way too much to take on considering they have so many kids.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Mommy 123, I'm sure most of their income comes from the show, but Jon does say in the opening that he works full-time as an IT analyst.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Its gonna be fun to watch because I have two kids and have absolutely no time to be potty training a puppy let alone two puppies.  WOW! I hope they know a good carpet cleaner.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	It's amazing what they will do for the money they're making with that show. I'm curious how they got that expensive house? I feel sorry for the people they're fooling.|`|uTvMXhaOaa	the puppies will be cute! <br>  <br>  good luck! and are they moving?
WWNWtzvDaa	i just thought OMG there are HUNDREDS of women murdered by their men EVERY fooking day and no one gives them a mention ...so why the fook are we soooo bother about her =/ .... no one knows what goes on behind close doors and to be honest i dont wanna know she will carry on making millions and maybe be a face of domestic violence and make more millions and chris brown will do time and come out like that other retard 50cent and start rapping about hoes and bit*tches ...he will change his name to BROWN CHRIS THE CRACK HEAD|`|Sp1DkZfgaa	she looks horrible! and chris brown did that to her?? i would not get back together with chris brown! he is such a jerk|`|59413dbe7b16fa26e3ec660d12dd098aaa	First, I want to say that I think it is completely inappropriate for whoever released this photo of her. I'm sure she is upset and embarrassed about the situation anyhow, but then to have the world see her in that state is beyond horrible. <br>  LET THIS WOMAN HAVE PRIVACY!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|93304731d8f7ad3db93cb6f2b04029bdaa	LOL Good, i'm so happy.  Lets see her live her life now.  She shouldn't go back to him, unless she's stupid, but then again, most women are so she'll probly go back with him.

FUcX640Haa	the 6th day<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216216/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216216/</a> i watched it yesterday|`|8jd2AHJdaa	It's Total Recall you fools!!|`|AA11649913	Sixth Day:<br>  <br>  Plot<br>  <br>  The film opens with a game of American Football in which one of the players, Johnny Phoenix, is mortally injured. As he is taken away in an ambulance, a Millenium Security agent, Robert Marshall, finishes him off by turning the machines off, but the news the next day announces that he will return for the next games: he has been illegally but secretly cloned, since while animal cloning is now perfectly normal, human cloning has been banned for years.<br>  <br>  Adam Gibson, a Double-X Charter pilot, faces his own problems with cloning: it is his birthday, and the family dog has just been euthanased by a veterinarian due to a dog disease, and Adam, who distrusts the cloning company, RePet, refuses to have the dog cloned, causing a row with his wife. While at work, his best friend, Hank Morgan, convinces him to at least check RePet out, switching places with him for a meeting with Michael Drucker, the Double-X Charter CEO. Adam visits RePet, and is almost tempted to clone his dog, but his eyes fall on a SimPal (life-sized animated dolls), which he gets for his daughter as promised. When he arrives home, however, he sees that he and the dog have been cloned, and the unaware clone of Adam has beaten him home. A group of assassins (Marshall, Talia, Wiley and Vincent) attempt to kill Adam, but Adam manages to escape in his cadillac, killing Wiley and Talia in the process. He goes to the police, who see him as a psychiatric patient (the clone had previously reported the "theft" of the cadillac) and contact the assassins to kill him. Adam manages to evade them, and kills a cloned Wiley by breaking his neck.<br>  <br>  Adam seeks refuge in Hank's apartment, and tells him everything. The two go to Adam's house, where Adam very nearly kills his clone from behind, but relents, and they leave without alerting the clone or Adam's family. In Hank's apartment, however, an Anti-Cloning Fundamentalist, Tripp, arrives and kills Hank. In the ensuing fight, Tripp escapes with a gunshot wound to the stomach, but is unable to escape from the car park. Adam finds him on the verge of death, and Tripp reveals that Hank was in fact a clone, since he killed the real Hank that same afternoon so he could kill Drucker, who was also a clone, and the man behind the cloning is Dr. Griffin Weir. Tripp kills himself with a gun, and Adam again manages to escape from Talia and Marshall, killing both of them and taking Talia's thumb to use her car.<br>  <br>  Adam decides to take matters into his own hands and stop the cloning. Weir, meanwhile, loses his wife, who he had cloned five years before, to Cystic Fibrosis. Weir runs a check on the DNA of all the people he has cloned, and finds that they all have congenital defects: they will die in 1-5 years unless they perform favours for Drucker, the mastermind behind the whole thing. Adam, with a smuggled gun and hostage guard, corners Weir in his lab and demands answers. Weir reveals that the cloning of Adam was in fact an accident: the day Tripp killed Drucker and Hank, Hank and Adam had switched places, leading them to believe that Adam had been killed and not Hank. Weir also tells him that one Adam has to die to cover the cloning up: if word gets out that Drucker is a clone, he loses everything, because human clones have no rights. Acting on Weir's advice, Adam rushes to his daughter's school to save his family in case the assassins target the Adam clone, but arrives too late: Talia and Vincent take them hostage. Adam confronts his clone, and the two agree to work together to rescue them.<br>  <br>  Weir, realising Drucker's deception, confronts him in his office. Drucker offers to clone Weir's wife again, but Weir refuses, as his wife had requested not to be cloned again. Weir resigns, but Drucker shoots him in the head, planning to clone both Weir and his wife with no memories of the past incident. Adam contacts Drucker and makes a deal with him to recover his family in exchange for Drucker's Syncording, the only proof of Drucker's cloning. The assassins go back on the deal, and capture Adam, while the clone is left at the Double-X Charter base with the syncording. In Drucker's office, Drucker reveals to Adam that it is in fact he, and not the other Adam, who is the clone. He offers a heartbroken Adam to give up the original and resume his life, but he refuses. They knock him out and take his Syncording, revealing the original to be at the base. However, Adam had faked the syncording: the original was behind Adam the whole time, and Adam didn't look at him to keep him out of his memory. In the ensuing fray, Drucker is shot by Wiley in the stomach, and Drucker shoots Wiley back, giving instructions not to revive him. Drucker attempts to clone himself while Adam kills the assassins off one by one. Adam confronts the new Drucker, and knocks him out.<br>  <br>  The original, meanwhile, locates his family and rescues them, returning to aid Adam against the killers. With the help of a bomb planted in the building, the two Adams manage to escape just before the explosion, which kills Drucker and all of his men. The next day, Adam visits his family one last time, giving them Hank's cat, and leaving them for good (under the pretense that he will be back soon). He bids farewell to the original Adam, and leaves the US to start his own business in Argentina.|`|L19Crpp9aa	The 6th Day  -- Total Recall is about him being a spy on Mars|`|Vk5gi3RKaa	The 6th day! one of the best

w1OG27LHaa	Ok, first of all dont bash the Jonas Brothers because they are making a living and loving the life that they have. Disney is a great place to start out an acting career. They help you alot and its great. Alot of people dont like disney because it "changes" the stars. But if they would stop taking nude pictures and acting like idiots, then disney wouldnt have to deal with kicking people out, and they wouldnt put so much pressure on the the stars. I know poeple make mistakes and problems occur, but at least if they are going to do things like that, then DONT GO ON DISNEY!<br>  Disney is supposed to set a good example for kids.

bm289GOuaa	Hahaha!<br>  Yes, he is in his own way. You know, he started out as part of the so-called "Bromley Contingent", a bunch of hardcore Sex Pistols fans, then was in a punk group called Generation X, but he realised that punk was not enough for him to express who he wanted to be. So he quit the band and went to America and made "Dancing With Myself" and then "Hot In The City", which is my fave of his. So he was one of the very first punks to break away from punk and do his own thing, see? And actually become even more famous because of it. That makes him pretty important. And yeah he is good-looking in a way. I mean, I'm a straight male, but I'm not scared to admit a guy can be kinda attractive. And he was in a way, like...in a sorta raunchy leering bada$$ way!<br>  I remember idolising him (no pun intended) when I was only 7. I nagged my mum to buy me hair gel to make my hair stick up like his. I used the 500 g tub of it in like a week..... Needless to say she didn't buy me more for years. But I digress.<br>  The great thing about Billy is how much of a well-balanced guy he is under it all. Have you heard his Christmas songs? He said in an interview I read somewhere online several months ago that at family gatherings at Christmas, his parents enjoyed it when he sang the songs. I think that's kinda cool. It's nice that he doesn't think he's above that. These days punks try too hard to look, sound and act like the popular concept of what punk is. Instead of daring to think outside the box, they shut themselves in it. That's wrong.|`|ahjSAkMbaa	No...Freddie Mercury is a legend! Billy Idol was more like a sensation. He got people's attention with his good looks, nice body, song writing, and...well...that sneer. He definitely has a place in rock history and helped bring punk mainstream although his songs weren't true punk, his looks represented that genre. His career "fizzled" because he was in a motor cycle accident that almost killed him and left him slightly lame. If you recall, "Rock The Cradle of Love" video only shows his face. He was still on crutches at the time.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Oh hell yes... a legend. It only took some 20 years for Steve Stevens guitar hooks to be embraced by classic rock...

You can't top "Rebel Yell", "Eyes Without a Face", "Flesh for Fantasy", and "Catch My Fall"!!!!:)|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	For his time, I will say yes. Definitely a 80's legend. Not too sure about an all-time legend though.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	YES!   "Dancing with Myself" "White Wedding" "Mony Mony"|`|AA12301664	no.<br>  <br>  not even close.<br>  <br>  he's an ****.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Maybe not yet... but I'd say he's going to be... He has lots of great songs out there.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	id say yes. i think he is.
Zyl2wBnPaa	She's a self centered baby. The other ones got booted too and you didn't see them crying. Life goes on, Tatiana...get over it.|`|rHrr7zmVaa	I don't think she was acting stupid but I thought Danny was being a douche to her by getting all the attention once his name was called.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Yeah. Ryan was offering her some sympathy, but she just jerked him away. That is not what our American Idol should be like. But then again, she has a great voice.|`|aEntHSbqaa	She acted better than i thought she would. <br>  I was really disgusted at the judges for trying to turn her back into the giggling fool the other nite.<br>  At the elimination round, the camera kept on focusing on her, hoping she would break down or something. I'm glad she kept her composure the best she could.|`|ztug2gLjaa	I just think she wants people to feel SORRY for her cause her dream is over!   BOO HOO... I think she's a drama queen and needs to grow up!|`|CpzlUpEnaa	She kinda did but thats how she acts.<br>  She was really a good singer.|`|YxwA5sjwaa	Yes, people like Tatiana are all about themselves, and feel the world owes her a living or a free pass.  We've seen enough of her, let some real talent come on.|`|qRTJc9yJaa	she sexy though =]
5agXk9ldaa	i would share it with you or invite you to a dinner|`|lEjYhwxkaa	no I would look inside of it for a driver's license and see who it belongs to and get in touch with them and return it. I returned a wallet before with money in it and the person was so happy she even gave me $40.00 and I felt good about myself.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	You bet! I'd scoop the money and leave the wallet... don't have much use for the personal stuff. Didn't their mom ever tell them not to carry that kind of cash? You should only ever carry what you can afford to lose.<br>  <br>  Besides, I've been screwed over enough... this would probably just be karma paying me back.|`|fKrnQx5iaa	In this time of crisis, "Finders keepers..."|`|AA11538538	I would take it.<br>  <br>  I turned one in to the police dept once that I found at a car wash, there was no money in it when i found it, but credit cards and a driver's license.  The guy tried to press charges against me for the $300 he said was left in it.<br>  <br>  Being the good guy doesn't always help you out.|`|EOTH56DWaa	If it was someone that I thought needed it bad I would give it back & refuse any reward. If it was some young thug drug dealer I would keep it. I'd mail the wallet back though. Getting new ID's when you have none is a bit ch.|`|NF1w4l04aa	honestly, I would not.  I've had my purse stolen twice in my life so I know what it feels like.  I'd contact the person and give it back as I found it.<br>  <br>  Of course, deep inside I'd be hoping for some type of cha-ching reward, but whatever|`|23Rup9DIaa	no, i wouldnt take the money out of it, i'd take it to the police and let them handle it, im not sure if id even open it|`|LgNqYUECaa	Yee.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	F*ck yeah.|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	If there was no ID, I'd probably take it.  If there was an ID inside, I'd probably give it back grudgingly but I would hope for a generous reward.|`|67GoFqKDaa	l would be a good samaritan and keep it|`|upazUCA6aa	i would ,but then i'll feel guilty <br>  i would mostly give it to a charity or something|`|TBjIJnWvaa	No.. Somebody might need it..and im sure if you lost 1000 you would appreciate it if somebody gave it back to you.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	no I`d give it an homeless.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Only if I couldn't find the owner. I think it would bother me if I took it outright.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	If there was a way to find the owner, I would give it all back to him/her.  If it was an empty wallet just with cash, I would get a counterfeit pen and make sure it wasn't fake.  I would donate half of it to a local charity and save the other half in a mutual fund and watch it mature.|`|Q9mQGz54aa	Wow...it's pretty hard decision but I'll just report it honestly|`|wJhZnNV7aa	Would depend where you found it and if there is any i.d inside. If you found it on the street and no i.d yeah i would keep it. If there was i.d i couldn't would have to give it back.|`|b757ceb4732a43e3be21f65805e76e72aa	if there was any ID in it i would return it. <br>  <br>  if not - finders keepers.|`|qRTJc9yJaa	I go to the mall. =]<br>  One man's trash is another man's treasure. hehe|`|XzAD49iraa	id take it...<br>  <br>  obviously, whoever owned the wallet...has money?<br>  <br>  and im sure wouldnt mind losing his "pocket change".<br>  <br>  and if he isnt rich with 1,000 in his wallet then he should have put it in a bank and its his loss...<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  sorry|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That depends if there was an address of the owner in it. If not, I'd keep it and buy my friends some drinks!|`|UXlveHUvaa	If it is a wallet there is most likely an ID in it.  I would return it to the rightful owner.  Failing that, I would at least report it properly.|`|NBi07o6zaa	I'd either take all of it or return it all and hope for a reward. If you take some of it, the owner would probably know.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Its ok  its my wallet lol|`|iWLaHVbfaa	If it had like a license or i.d. I'd look them up but if not...bills here I come|`|HEhIfLpbaa	i dunno - years ago i would of handed it in but in todays society id take the cash! maybe feel guilty for a while but id use it to pay bills.|`|eYBX8yetaa	yeah i would take it and never go back to that place where i found it :)|`|AA11523465	If it has id in it, I'd try to return it.  If not, I'd turn it over to the police and wait the 30 days.|`|HEQc83d9aa	no I would hand it over to the cops.|`|BfhiLE0maa	if there was a driver's license or I.D. in it, it would be really horrible to take it, but if there was nothing else in it...hell yeah|`|a7TgRnL3aa	Do I look like a charity case?  No one needs it more than I do.  I'll keep it damnit.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Of coursee we will take. It.<br>  I would and spend it right away. LOl <br>  So there wont be any evidence|`|lnf9Ccwwaa	hell yeah!|`|AA11596713	i'd take it.  Who'd be stupid enough to leave their wallet with a grand inside?|`|NiRFYhVDaa	yes sure ..but be guilty for taking it|`|Y0RBIZJzaa	i'll try to find who it belongs to|`|8HDlfG2Iaa	yeah i wouldd|`|4JiqK2jtaa	Yes.. with todays economy... deffinatly yes.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	i would take it in a heart beat|`|E5Cwsciyaa	If there was an I.D. in it I would give it back. If there was no I.D. I'm keeping it.|`|Gd5YgR7Baa	no id let someone elese find free money|`|pRYTop6Saa	hmm depends who it belonged to|`|grifjdr0aa	No way.  Give it to the owner.|`|YLgdMXiQaa	Yes i would take some of it.. i would call it finders fee|`|BBVfRheyaa	Yes,I add another 1000$ and bring them police.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	depends on my mood. If I was feeling charitable, I might return it, but I'd expect a reward of 10-20%.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	I found one  with 3,000 in it and return it...........|`|9YZld18maa	Not all of of it but i would probably take about 95% of it! ^_^"|`|lILfQh6xaa	if there was no way to identify it and didnt know what to do cuz nobody was around, then Hell ya i would keep it. $1000 could help take care of my family. But if sombody asked me for it, i would hand it over.|`|iFuO8gy7aa	Hell Yeah!|`|VXCCjdZhaa	Hell no.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	im not going to lie, i would prolly take it if no one was around. i know that if i turned it in the person that i turned it into would prolly take it too.|`|9120dc418a017a1bdb6aae2ce3dfc8caaa	No, because that happened to me, I lost my billfold and someone was kind enough to return it to me!|`|n55igpCUaa	of course I would =D I need a new hard drive!|`|whg557P5aa	I'd be tempted to take a bit yes, and hand the rest in.|`|8f81c557782db78a6e0cfb5ef1ca75a0aa	The thought would cross my mind but I would not act on it. I would turn the wallet intact in.
ebR3nOL1aa	I would react 'ouch'! I don't like watching it neither. I can't imagine losing those. I really need my penis and my balls. I love 'em so much.|`|SqX9dGRWaa	how bout putting your skull in a vice and slowly turning it and than leaving it there for hours while your still alive and they actualy do that in the middle east or getting your fingers chopped off than blowtorched shut to seal the bleeding and than bein further tortured even worse like getting your eye balls stabbed and worse for hours

Cmun3Ec5aa	yeah i agree, the program was a bit silly and hard to believe, but i thought the rest of the program was a lot more in depth and that with freddie. i don't understand what effy's playing at, one minute she doesn't care about freddie, then just as we think they have a chance of getting together (with the kissing and that) we see cook with effy!<br>  <br>  i reckon this program has made almost everyone hate cook tons. well i do anyway :L i also don't understand why in that fighting scene cook kissed him and said he loved him, then went and slept with effy. i can't wait to see how it's all resolved, if it can be!<br>  <br>  but yeah, best so far, verrrry emotional i thought.

b9wICW1Paa	Fairy tales were clearly inspiration for modern horror writers and filmmakers.  If you recall many of the fairy tales heard during your youth, many have a decidedly dark side to them that often gets glossed over during the retelling.  <br>  <br>  If you consider only the tale of Hansel and Gretel, a witch is one of the central characters, and she plans to eat two children.  The children trick the witch into climbing into her own oven, where she obviously burns to death.  Although not quite so graphic in its details, the dark and horrific implications are quite clear.  Part of the modern horror film "Return to House on Haunted Hill" involves an evil character being burned to death in an oven, possibly directly inspired by Hansel and Gretel.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	who would attack you when you're sleeping? (Freddy Krugar)|`|S52ODgwmaa	I think that often horror movies take fairytale elements and twist them to make them creepy. Stephen King claims that horror films are like fairy tales in function. He says that they do the "dirty job" of bringing out "the worst in us" and give our "anticivilization emotions" a place to be free, without restraints.|`|v9vrH4Exaa	Two Words:<br>  Darkness Falls.<br>  that obviously was influenced by the tooth fairy.

hqH1EZFSaa	The fourth season starts with Michael avenging Sara's "death", before learning that Gretchen did not kill her as he thought. Michael also learns the truth about Whistler, that he has secretly been working alongside Mahone to take down the Company. A Company operative takes Whistler's life shortly after this. Sona has burned down and Sucre, Bellick and T-Bag have escaped during the chaos. After returning to Chicago to look for Sara, Michael is arrested and recruited by Don Self (Michael Rapaport), a Department of Homeland Security agent, to help bring down the Company in exchange for his freedom. Lincoln, who was arrested in Panama is transferred to Chicago, and along with Mahone, Sucre, and Bellick with whom a deal is made. Also joining the group are Sara, who escaped from Gretchen which resulted in Gretchen's own captivity by the Company, having failed to secure a valuable item, and Roland (James Hiroyuki Liao), a hacker who was assigned to help them after getting arrested for identity theft. Together, they devise a plan to retrieve Scylla, thought of as the Company's 'little black book', from the Company that will help to destroy them. In the meantime, Wyatt (Cress Williams), an agent from the Company, attempts to track Michael and Lincoln down. When the group eventually succeeds in stealing Scylla, Self betrays them and tries to sell Scylla, but fails. Right before the mid-season break, it is revealed that Michael and Lincoln's mother is still alive and has obtained Scylla.|`|41gtr3j7aa	It has been shared with us that Michael Scofield play by Wentworth Miller, the beloved hero and star of Fox’s Prison Break, will suffer an untimely death by seasons end.

D8KgIX8naa	It was a big thing on the show to never show his face. It was just for fun. They did show his face at the end.|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Wilson's Face - Wilson was inspired in part by a neighbor that Tim Allen had when he was too young to see over his neighbor's fence (and therefore unable to see his neighbor). As a result, the bottom half of Wilson's face was almost never seen on the show. Initially he was always seen with his mouth obscured by the fence; the gag quickly became covering the lower half of his face with other props, wardrobe, set pieces, other characters' heads, or using unconventional camera angles. Occasionally, the top half of his face would be covered leaving only the bottom half visible, and rarely, his entire face would be shown disguised by makeup for a costume. Earl Hindman's face was fully shown following the series finale episode while taking his final bow, though he did come out holding a miniature fence on a stick over the lower half of his face for one last gag. However, his full face is very briefly seen over the fence in the pilot episode.|`|fEhR7bOMaa	Wilson's Face - Wilson was inspired in part by a neighbor that Tim Allen had when he was too young to see over his neighbor's fence (and therefore unable to see his neighbor).
