uVMlNvLoaa	Some women menstruate regularly or lightly into their pregnancies. I would highly suggest that you take a pregnancy test right now to rule out that as a factor.<br>  <br>  Next time, use a condom or go on some birth control, k?|`|jf4UOCElaa	depending on if your taking some kind of contraceptive it could be throwing your period off i think your ok tho|`|62X7JGBdaa	I'm only 12 but you should take a birthtest like a per stick.|`|ioNKVW9haa	Definitely take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  A cousin of mine actually got a light period for the first three months of her pregnancy.  Another friend of mine didn't even know she was pregnant until she was 5 months along.  She had absolutely no symptoms of being pregnant and had gotten pregnant while switching birth control pills, so she wasn't expecting a regular period.<br>  <br>  The point is that some pregnancies have HORRIBLE symptoms, and some have absolutely none.<br>  <br>  Take a test, find out for sure.|`|yBlvM7fSaa	Sounds like you have an STD. go get checked ASAP and it is probably cured with antibiotics.|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Caused by the stress.  If you're worried see a doctor.|`|evK2CD6Faa	YOU COULD BE PREGNANT AND YOU COULD HAVE AN S.T.D GO TO THE DOCTORS|`|rlWZtKx2aa	take a test.  you don't always get symptoms when you are pregnant.
4KNZ0xefaa	its discharge. this happened to me!|`|yBlvM7fSaa	that was probably dried blood...kind of looks like poop though lol. but it is probably dried blood...mine is almost always brown or dark black when im on my period...you can bleed inside and it dries so that is where the color comes from. Wear a pad tomorrow!!!|`|ZRgLHW3maa	if you are having discharge, and a brown stain then I would say congrats, you are becoming a woman! wear a panty liner at least and bring pads just in case you do start and it is too heavy for a panty liner. GOOD LUCK|`|62X7JGBdaa	yes because if u do have if period and don't wear a pad it will bleed through ur clothes.|`|NBEuxzDBaa	It's yr period it's always brown the first time|`|3XDr0EiSaa	I had this and the next day I had my very first period!

I have discharge too I know this sounds so sick but like smell it! if it smells like crap ewwish but if its your period, its the normal age for your period! you might wanna consider wearing a pag tomorrow im a 30aa(yeah im small no seriously im so tiny my mom said I look like a 4th grader! im in the 6th grade)|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Probably wouldn't hurt to carry one in your back pack.  You may want to take some pain meds with you too, but you may need to leave them with the school nurse.|`|DCM4neHTaa	This is going to sound gross, but it's your body so so what--stick a finger inside and find out.|`|rlWZtKx2aa	LOL @ poop stain.<br>  well unless you farted in class and left a skid mark, then it's probably your first period.|`|utAKfPYZaa	I would wear a pad just to be safe:) just incase|`|DlH6n9PNaa	Yea u should wear a pad just in case|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	you should at least wear a pantyliner and take a few with you as back up. Congratulations and good luck!|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It sounds like your have started your first period, as some start with a brownish stain.  You should probably wear a pad to school tomorrow and to bed tonight.<br>  <br>  It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Sounds like you got your period. Welcome to womanhood, it kind of sucks.<br>  <br>  You can wear a pad if it makes you feel more secure and it's probably a good idea, but there most likely won't be too much more blood.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	damn im 15 and 5 feet lol<br>  but anyways<br>  i think you should take a pad to school with you but usually the first time you get your period its not soo bad but ya take a pad with you i mean you never know|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	It's probably about to start so, pads. :P|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	poop stains , liner yes
WXX1HZ3uaa	first of all i cant blame you for feeling that way, but you have to remember he is a doctor...its his job...you shouldnt feel that way with doctors...they have to touch alot of males that way just to make sure you are healthy and nothing is wrong down there...try not to feel that way...im sure it will be hard but just dont forget he is a doctor.|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	Well your right, you can deny that part of the exam but it's hard to get some jobs (especially government) because they require the prostate exam (that's the pants dropping part).

xsyAljhaaa	What about your deadlift? That's the most important one from a powerlifting perspective. They say the competition isn't over until the bar hits the floor-- deadlift is done last. That's fairly good for being like 16, keep up the good work. It sounds like these lifts were done "raw," that is, without any equipment like knee wraps or a bench shirt. <br>  <br>  Since you gave us 2/3 of a powerlifting total, I have a couple things to say regarding form: 1) a squat isn't good unless it is 2 or 3 inches below parallel, but maybe not a great idea if you had a bad fracture, and 2) why not arch your back? It's the preferred way to do bench presses in powerlifting. A bench is legal as long as you keep your feet on the floor, your shoulders and butt are touching the bench the entire time, and  the bar is held level during the attempt.|`|3Fma3URSaa	pretty good

CzZPFS0zaa	I generally tell people that smoking with a new piercing is just putting on more thing on there to irritate it. BUT, if cancer doesn't stop people a lip ring damn sure won't. LOL. I also let them know, if they choose to smoke try to carry a bottle of alcohol free mouth wash with them and rinse at least after every few cigarettes. The good thing is, unless you are rubbing your cigarette all over it, most of the chemicals are going in your mouth as you inhale rather than just lingering on the piercing. Keep an eye on it after you get it, if it starts to look irritated or the healing seems to be going slow, just have your piercer take a look at it. They will be able to let you know in their best opinion if you should lay off the cigarettes and for how long.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	8 weeks.|`|ZQV4QAD3aa	my friend was smoking the same day with her tongue and lip pierced. im ot saying its a good idea but its possible.
AqzsQyygaa	It could be a boil, it could be an ingrown hair, but my guess is that it's just a really deep zit.  You can put a thin layer of toothpaste on it (not gel toothpaste, regular) to help it go down, but if your skin is very sensitive it might make it look worse.  I had a huge zit on my chin and I put toothpaste on it and the next day I had a crater where the zit was.  But I globbed the toothpaste on and covered it with a bandaid.  So a thin layer could help.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	this post might help<br>  <a href="http://www.promdinurses.com/2009/01/diseases-and-conditions-types-of-acne.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promdinurses.com/2009/01/dise...</a>|`|Hxttt7G0aa	It could be a boil developing.

ftidgUNXaa	There are multiple meds for Anxiety.  Some are called Benzos (short name for them) such as Xanax,  Klonopin.<br>  <br>  Xanax is the shortest acting of them all, and most addicting.  I took xanax and have literally zero side effects, but sometimes a little more tired.  If you want something to take on a "as needed" basis, Xanax works good.  Just don't over-do it.  Taking it on a daily basis will probably lead to addiction, as Xanax is the most addicting because it's so short acting (6 hours or so i believe). Things such as Klonopin are more longer acting, less addictive, but arguably not as strong acting as Xanax.<br>  <br>  They also give antidepressants (SSRIs) to treat anxiety, such as Prozac, paxil, lexapro, zoloft.  Although these are taken on a DAILY basis, unlike Xanax that can be taken on a "as need basis".  Antidepressants also generally have more side effects then anxiety medications.  At least in general.<br>  <br>  In terms of what will give you more side effects for the Anti-anxiety meds... impossible to tell.  Some people take things such as Xanax and have zero side effects. Others take it and have multiple side effects... You'll probably just have to try ask the doctor to try one out, and see how it effects you.|`|gr4IFLsMaa	I use to take Lexapro for anxiety and it worked great for 2 years but for me because of bipolar disorder it caused a manic episode so I had to be taken off of it, but other than that, Lexapro was great for my anxiety.  Now I'm on Valium and it helps for my anxiety.  Either way (Lexapro or Valium), you (or I), will still have moments of anxiety so you will still have to find ways of dealing with it.  I do yoga for one hour twice daily.  I wish you best of luck and I hope you get on a treatment plan that works for you.  Make sure you let the doctor know you'd like to be in therapy too because therapy is also a good treatment option.  Therapy can be a useful tool for venting and getting feedback on learning ways of dealing with the stresses of everyday life.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  Andy...|`|grm23kvjaa	lexapro is great. i take it on a daily basis and it says its an antidepressant but it also helps curb anxiety attacks.  when i do experience an anxiety attack i have xanax to help stop it and it only takes an average of 15 min to kick in. it may make you seem drowsy but that is the only thing i have experienced when taking the xanax.|`|yboEJ4jHaa	There are a number of meds that address anxiety. The most commonly used are the benzodiazepines: Xanax, Valium, Ativan. They are easily abused and are best used sparingly, not for long-term resolution. A better choice may be Buspar, a non-mood altering medication. Another choice may be propanolol (Inderal) whose cardiac effects have a calming influence.|`|fwWq2llXaa	Klonopin helps ease some anxiety - it tends to make me alittle drowsy/sleepy and dulls my thinking some.  I've heard Lexapro is good - I'd like to try that
xsyAljhaaa	Your abs can handle hard exercise 7 days a week, as well as your calves. The thing is with the rectus abdominus muscles, the six-pack muscles, is that if you only do sit-ups or crunches straight up and down, or do them with weights is that your stomach can appear to bulge out because of increase in the muscle size working only in one direction. What you can do is to do crunches with a twist where you alternate one elbow towards the opposite knee. Obviously you can't touch your elbow to your knee while doing crunches, just aim towards it. You can also an exercise with a broom handle. You put the broom handle behind  your neck and grasp it with a regular grip with both hands and twist the handle towards the floor then to the other side. Twist towards the floor but you basically stand in an upright position with feet about shoulder width apart. You will lean slightly forward when you twist, and concentrate on the contraction of you midsection muscles. Another exercise that will help a little is to stand upright, feet shoulder width apart, and pick up a light dumbbell ONLY in one hand. Put the hand without a dumbbell on the side of your head with the elbow pointing out and lean towards the side with dumbbell then lean as far as reasonable in the opposite direction. Don't lean forward or backward while doing this. Do an ab-worthy number of reps, then switch to the other side.<br>  These exercises use more than just the rectus abdominus muscles and the midsection muscles get worked from different angles. This can help to flatten your stomach where regular crunches can have the opposite effect. Also watch your diet, but if you are a gymnast you don't need me to tell you that, LoL. I don't know how much ab work you do but don't be afraid to do lots of reps. In the past I've done thousands of crunches a day, and included hundreds of weighted crunches and machine crunches with hundreds of pounds--you just can't really overtrain your abs.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	You're already doing enough exercise. You need to sort out your eating (more important for fat loss anyway).|`|8xPWd35maa	You are definitely doing enough exercise.   Maybe you could try and regulate your food consumption?   Try a website such as www.mypyramid.gov, when you ented your information, there will be an option for a healthy weight loss, or something like that.   You then input your food intake each day and it tells you how many calories you've eaten and which nutrients you need more of, etc.   You might find that you eat too many saturated fats and not enough fruit, or something like that.  It will make a difference.   Good luck.  =)|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Well a common misconception is that you can trim one are of your body. If you want to get that flat stomach look, you'll need to yes work out your abdominal muscles, but also your entire core, and reducing your overall body fat %. You can do all the sit ups in the world, but if you don't minimize the fat (we all have) that cover that muscle, well you just won't see it. So to answer your question directly. A routine that will best suit you is one that burns fat, and aims at those abs. Your cheer/ Gymnastics exercises are great for the fat burning. And you are correct, you'll need a lot more than just crunches. You need to get at those abs from all angles.

ygcbrp5Uaa	LOL!!!! Wow... I doubt the answer to your question is anything extreme to the point that you need to see a doctor like in the other answers...<br>  <br>  Having a little blood in one is nothing to worry about. It just means that you probably coughed it up to hard and ruptured a small capillary in your throat. This also happens with people that cough them up all the time because it weakens the lining. (Kind of like people who blow their nose a lot are more likely to get a bloody nose.) <br>  <br>  Believe it or not but coughing and hacking takes a lot more force then you think...<br>  <br>  Unless it becomes a frequent thing and the amount of blood involved increases, don't worry about it; It's nothing to see a doctor over.|`|AA11462474	i am not a doctor but it is never a good thing to cough up blood. you may have a respitory related infection, none the less i would go get looked at by your family doctor|`|9mtMw9Qaaa	GIRLS PLUS LOOGIES=EEEEEEWWWWWWWWWLLL<br>  ARE U A REDNECK!!!<br>  I FEEL SRRY 4 WHOMEVER KISSES U<br>  10 POINTS PLEESE =]|`|jpqSnCpuaa	if you have been coughing often for the past few days it could be related to that.  if you are running a fever or if it keeps happening or is alot more blood than you should go see a doctor.  for now i think it is nothing to worry about.  remember that you know your body best and if you think something is wrong you should go get checked out.|`|CKKisY5Aaa	I always say you can  never be to careful.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	The Valium or Versed are used to calm a person down and help with anxiety.  They are used in conjunction with other anesthetics in minor surgical procedures.  The nice thing about Versed is that along with making you sleepy, it also interferes with short term memory formation.  In other words, you don't care what's going on while it's going on and you don't remember it afterwards either.  It's commonly used along with local anesthetics in dental procedures to produce a twilight sedation.  You are awake enough to answer direct questions, but snooze in the  meantime, and you just don't care what's going on.  Propofol and Ketamine are both anesthetics used in short term procedures like your wisdom teeth extraction.  Both are fairly short acting, and fairly easy to rouse from afterwards.  Fentanyl is a pain reliver that can be used with the anesthetics as well, and given just at the end so you are comfy when you wake up.  I would think for the extraction they would chose a twilight anesthesia, rather than a full anesthesia as is used for surgery like the removal of the appendix.  It's easier to wake up from, and you tend to be back on your feet faster.  Either way, with those combinations of drugs, I can't tell you exactly what the surgeon has planned and it will likely depend on your state of mind at the time.  The major thing is your fear factor, and that's one you can help control.  You aren't going to go to sleep and never wake up, so lets just set that particular fear to the side.  You will have an IV started, and they will probably give you a bit of the Versed to chill you out.  You will drift off to sleep more than likely, just like you do when you tuck in to bed at night.  You may be slightly aware of the things going on around you, maybe not.  Mostly, you just won't care.  Your next memory will be of a doctor, nurse or technician talking to you and asking you to work with them- to open your eyes and move things around a little.  You will be groggy, and for a moment you may even be slightly disoriented.  Once you are responding a bit better, you may even be asked to sit up or stand up, with help.  The grog should pass in a few minutes time, and you will just feel really sleepy and tired, but you will be awake to be under your own power to leave.  You won't be in any pain at all.  The local anesthetic will not wear off for a bit, and you should have already had some Fentanyl to cover the rest.  I'd not imagine you will feel much for a few hours afterward, and by then you will be home in your own surroundings with your prescription medications near.  You will not have any memory of much of anything that happened a few minutes after getting the sedation meds.  What you can do is just remember to keep your sanity and stay calm.   If you go to sleep all keyed up, you are more likely to wake up upset and crying, and make yourself ill.   It's okay if that happens, it's just not real pleasant for you.  If you can calm yourself beforehand, you can enjoy a nice nap.  It will all go just fine dear.  Lots of people have this done, and the doctor and staff are well trained to do this.  Don't go working yourself into a tizzy beforehand.  Deal with what happens when it happens.  I'd suggest a nice meal today though, because it may be a few days before you are on full feed again.  Your stomach will think you lost more than a few teeth, and you will be very tired of soft stuff before you get real chewy foods again.  Good luck, and just stay chilled and calm as you can.|`|8xPWd35maa	When I had my wisdom teeth out about a year ago, they hooked me up to an IV and I was knocked out cold.   As long as you stay relaxed, you'll be fine.  Don't freak out, it'll only make things worse.

AA10450505	GOOD for you! Follow your gut!!! The Loestrin was aok, except for blemishes?? It's a tried and true, safe BC med. Ask your doc to prescribe a topical facial gel, called "MINOCIN." Your skin will clear in a few days ans you'll avoid ALL the unfortunate info, recently and presently emerging, around "YAZ." You're an intuitive woman.|`|ZhpHljpNaa	I've been on Yaz for a little over a year now and I really like it. I was on Yasmin, which made me super emotional and I hated it! Yaz cleared up my skin and I love it! I do cry a lot though.
R9KvEhMxaa	Hm. I don't know about 90%, but it's incredibly high, much higher than average. <br>  <br>  Seroquel is not one of the most potent antipsychotics, but it is one of the most sedating. It is generally not an ideal first line med for managing bipolar disorder, though it does get used frequently. It's important to remember that stabilizing bipolar is not a simple task, you cannot pick one medication off the shelf and have it fit everyone. It generally takes months to years to find an appropriate medication combination through trial and error.<br>  <br>  As for why do people get involved in relationships with those with bipolar disorder? They're people. Like everyone else. They don't come with a label that says "I am bipolar, relationships with me will tend to fail when I go manic and fly to Hawaii to open a ski resort".|`|XAIiOFkXaa	Marriage is a tough road for anyone. Someone with that type of disorder begins with a handicap to forming relationships. <br>  There are no surprises in those stats. Just think about it.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Girls start their periods anywhere from 9-17 years old and all are normal.  It will happen when your body develops sufficient hormones to cause ovulation.  When that happens you will have a need for a lining in your uterus which will then come out as periods.  There is nothing you can do to make this process happen any faster than nature wants it to.  In the meantime, relax and be happy you don't have bloody, stinky discharge coming from your body with cramps that sometimes send girls to bed and PMS that causes you to be mean to the people you love.  Go somewhere and do the happy dance that you don't have something that will basically make you miserable for the next 40 or so years.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|xETCO0rUaa	Yup any day.. When i first got mine i got really depressed, like sucidle ( no clue how to spell that ). Also whenever i'm PMSing it's really hard for me to focus. You're probably going to get yours any minute.

I started at 11. but don't feel weird, because I speak for almost all women when I say you are not missing a thing. once you start, you will understand why it sucks so bad to have one. but don't worry, you will get it soon enough! Good luck when you do!|`|AA10450505	Perfectly normal. Girls who are athletic /thin, may start later.

iK3YYRaTaa	Missy, read my lips: DIVORCE ! Joking!<br>  <br>  Anger and frustration can be common reactions when someone has a chronic disease like diabetes. It is a lot to cope with, and at times it may really be upsetting to have to deal with diabetes day after day for a lifetime. Plus, physiologically, when someone's blood sugar fluctuates, spikes or drops, it can produce feelings like anger, anxiety, or depression that are really out of the control of the person experiencing them. It may be easy for spouses to overlook or make excuses for angry reactions because of these reasons. However, anger that escalates into physical, verbal, or emotional abuse is not a normal reaction.<br>  <br>  Every person has a right to get angry sometimes. But if that anger is expressed violently, to hurt or scare a partner, then it becomes domestic abuse. Abuse can be actual physical contact, like hitting, slapping, pushing, or otherwise inflicting bodily harm, but it can also be threatening, making a spouse feel intimidated or scared. If you are in a relationship that is abusive, it is important to tell someone that you trust: a friend, counselor, social worker, or your healthcare provider. Abusive relationships are often isolated ones, where the abused spouse lives in secrecy and fear. Telling others breaks the silence, and enables the abused partner to more easily seek help.<br>  <br>  Go to this support group. Sign in and start.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://diabeticfamilysupport.aimoo.com" rel="nofollow">http://diabeticfamilysupport.aimoo.com</a>|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Try to be understanding and learn all you can about the disease.  It will take time for him to start accepting this diagnosis. I would totally suggest you (and him if he is willing) join a social networking site called www.tudiabetes.com.  It is a place where you can get support from others who like you, live with a diabetic.  It will help your husband in that he will see he is not alone out there with this disease.  Members are great about answering questions and being supportive.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!  It is tough dealing with a loved one who is angry over a diagnosis like this. If he continues to behave this way and not be willing to learn more about the disease then you will have to set some firm boundaries with him.  It is not OK that you and the family are taking the brunt of his anger. It's understandable since he just found out but it cannot go on for too long, it is not fair to you and the family.|`|dJ2shbJIaa	I was kinda like that at first. My hubby and 2 boys, where very good during my upset moments. Its a lot to deal with at first. Let him know when he's being mean.Sometimes we don't know we are being like that. If your are having trouble telling him, make a sign and hold it up each time he gets up set and make funny faces at him. I can't stay mad at anyone that does that.  good luck|`|yr71Trrnaa	I have diabetes type one and i know that is fare like the type one, but you shouldn't worry, diabetes is not a bed thing, think of it like a new and healthier way of living. all will stay the same, just don't feed him with sugar lol
UL3XOKJxaa	The sedation will last as long as necessary to remove the teeth...usually less than 30 minutes. You will be drowsy most of the day, but you will be awake. Caffeine will not help and I would advise against it. You will do fine. Good luck
lgNtAyLJaa	The best way to burn fat is to consume less food and exercise more, the difficulties surface when we actually try to put that into operation! There are loads of stumbling blocks in the big wide world aren't there?! The one diet which clearly delivered for me is green tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials left, it was featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed twenty pounds, it clearly does work!|`|4odI2sFgaa	try to eat healthier and excersise more-|`|U1iBgxKmaa	yeah ur a fatty no doubt. and ur friends think ur pretty dumb, dumb enuf to bleieve ur not. go get a diet. plz. for me.
jQBM2AGkaa	I doubt this was to do with the fluoxetine. More likely, it's an emotional response to do with being somewhat better and looking to move forward with your life. Depression, although horrible, is a comfort zone where we can hide from the world and we get used to that. When we step out of that comfort zone, it can be terrifying. <br>  <br>  Give yourself a break, and don't see this as another symptom that needs treating, unless it takes over your life. Just see it as a natural response to a very brave and frightening thing you're doing: taking control of your life. Stick with it, and it'll subside in time.|`|SLph9RX6aa	it could just be a one off, if it happens again speak to your doctor. was this one of your symptoms?<br>  i think prozac can be brilliant but there are newer better drugs which work in the same way, suroxate or citralipram the more modern versions and may suit you better|`|5voSgc6Oaa	Prozac can affect people differently, when i was on Prozac they used to make me very bad tempered and aggressive. My doctor took me off them and prescribed Satilopram, I have no aggression now but i still suffer the odd mood swings.|`|f849fe6f1344072ff248076d8c5de5a4aa	yes it could be. the effect that prozac has on you definitely changes over time - see your doctor<br>  <br>  prozac absolutely saved my life so I'm a fan, but it did have side effects, for me it completely wiped out my short-term memory, like I would arrange to be 4 places at the same time and not realise till I was going out the door lol, was inconvenient but thankfully not dangerous. Yours sounds like it could lead to something more serious so get it checked out
9b3xkt36aa	Burns are nasty and can take a little while.  It's expensive but I'd recommend using a medication called "Flamizine" (medicated cream used specifically for burns) and healing occurs WAY faster and with less permanent scaring left behind.  Works wonders but...it is a little pricey
HYjsxoNaaa	It's definitely not OK, go see your therapist and stop lying to your doctor. Anorexia can cause death.

Is that possible?|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Your thinking is still unhealthy, believing you are well when you are still very sick.   Well people have curves - and energy - and love life - and food.<br>  <br>  Go back to your therapist - you still have a long way to go.<br>  <br>  Fact is, at age 16 the brain is not yet fully developed, and it is difficult for someone your age to be able to envision your future...3 yrs...5 yrs ...<br>  10 yrs...  +.     So, do you want to marry?  Do you want to be a mom?<br>  The nutrition you feed your body today may determine the longterm health of your baby's life.<br>  <br>  So, go back to your therapist - and gain LIFE PERSPECTIVE - and CHOOSE HEALTH for the rest of your life.   Until you can achieve this frame of mind, you are not yet done with therapy!|`|A96W1WVCaa	I hope you ment 119 lbs....... it's not OK to be anorexic, look tha sh*t up on google. It's disgusting looknig, ruins your complexion, ruins your hair, ruins your life. You need to just gain weight, what you think is obese is no where near it. I'm 5'1 and I weigh 103lbs, and I'm 17 years old! Just stop caring about what everyone else thinks, life is much easier that way, those who care you don't need anyways. Don't let this stupid disorder ruin your life, and eventually kill you, it's not a good way and I am SURE you do not feel good in the process, how can you feel fine starving to death? Please save yourself before it is too late. :(|`|2jMFurDoaa	definitely not ok honey.<br>  <br>  go back and see your therapist.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	no.  its not okay.|`|Xy30D0nyaa	Truthfully, it's not ok. Being 119 pounds doesnt mean your obese, and i understand that you want feel skinny, but since your only 119 pounds you probably are. What you need is some confidence in yourself and you have to want to change.<br>  <br>  i know someone that was anorexic for a couple years and she wound up in the hospitle and was told by the doctor that if she didn't change her lifestyle he couldnt promise that she would live til she was 20.<br>  <br>  You should want to change and now I'm positive people will need you and it might seem pointless right now i matters|`|O5Zr5cWqaa	Please be kidding about weighing 19 pounds, thats just crazy, No of course its not F!@#ing okay, You need to go to these people and see them.. Get whatever you need to have, done, and then Living on to tell your story to anorexic children all over the world, thus becoming famous. Or writing a book about it..|`|kLEiXXmyaa	It is not okay. You can get serious health problems and eventually die. Go back to your therapist or psychologist and tell your doctor the truth. They're all just there to help.<br>  <br>  Right now you might feel obese but with help, you'll see yourself in a different and better light.|`|rdcUOa1zaa	no. and what do u mean u liked it better when u were anorexic? YOU STILL ARE!!! 19 pounds?! how are you still alive!!!??? i would think that all ur bones plus ur skin would equal more than nineteen pounds!!!<br>  ur not obese!!! u should weigh like 115 or 120 pounds at that age!! gosh im being really insensitive. but i mean u asked for true answers and u said u needed advise so im giving it to you. eat please u are really unhealthy and i know i dont know you but i really do care. eat.|`|f8rYpHTJaa	umm it might seem normal to you but u need to teach yourself to love everything about u, forget about ur weight ur a teen have fun as long as u exercise u will be happy with your body, i don't wanna be anorexic but i do care about my weight and every time i go for a jog or do some sit ups i feel so much better, u should try that|`|Ia1ddgSCaa	If you were 19lb you'd be dead!  that's 1stone 5lb!  Your bones weigh more than that.
AA10450505	GO, at ONCE, for a second opinion. A mammogram may be insufficient to detect, and an MRI indicated. YOU know your body, and you know, instinctually, that somwthing is a miss. NO worries - chanxes are a fibroid = innocuous. Yhe worrying is more dangherous to your health, more than likely. Don't put it off, okay? Promise? I'm a cancer survivor and can assure you that I'd NOT be typing this, had I not advocated for myself. BE WELL.|`|utAKfPYZaa	If its really bothering you then just go back to the doctors and get them to check it out again. Theres no hurt in just checking though im sure its nothing.|`|rdcUOa1zaa	get it checked out again. also if ur breasts are more tender than normal that is a sign of breast cancer along with the lump.<br>  also try squeezing ur nipple to see if any thing comes out. any secretion is not normal unless you just had a baby and its breast feeding or something. but if not and there is something coming out whether its blood or something else thats another sign of breast cancer. i would see ur doc again.
XK0kZ8Iiaa	Maybe if you asked nicely, it would go over better. More like you were concerned for her instead of yourself.

There are a lot of opportunities to fail in the big wide world aren't there?!

GBG2hbQ4aa	Your adrenal glands are possibly 'off'...it's a typical symptom of overactive adrenals to have uncontrollable anger (rage). If your adrenal glands are being heavily taxed (now), they can eventually just kinda exhaust themselves, and you will be left (at some point) with unbelieveable fatigue, not to mention an additional health problem. <br>  A second point is that anger is generally not a primary emotion. Most anger is in response to someone causing us pain on some level, hurting or offending us deeply, for instance. It takes a lot sometimes to recognize what the underlying emotion(s) might be (which is why counseling can help). Remember I said 'generally'...because there are imbalances in the body that can trigger explosive anger with no other emotional states underlying it.<br>  There are some dietary considerations you might want to explore. Our food supply is so full of 'foods that aren't foods"...heavily processed foods with little or no nutritional value that are loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients. These foods can and do wreck havoc on our systems (nervous system, endocrine system). Pay attention to what you have been eating. Keep a food journal if you can. This can help you identify if a particular food item may be contributing to your explosive behaviors. With processed foods, it is most likely an additive that is causing problems...many of the artificial ingredients are neuro-toxic, meaning they are toxic to the brain and nervous system. It takes some detective work to ferret this out. Your family and friends can assist in this process. They can likewise keep tabs on what you are eating or drinking, especially noting what you have ingested prior to a rage episode. <br>  Make dietary changes as needed. Add supplements to be sure your body, your nervous system, and your brain are getting adequate levels of all nutrients. A good multi-vitamin mineral complex is a good place to start. Add a B100 complex (critical for healthy nervous system and brain function) once a day. A good EFA (essential fatty acid) is critical, take as directed on label. Check with the health food store to see what is available for adrenal support, and take as directed on label as well.<br>  It is good that you are looking for answers for yourself, and that you recognize your rage is inappropriate, unhealthy and dangerous. Educate yourself on promoting your overall health. Diet is so critical to health and wholeness, as is exercise, and stress management. <br>  <br>  Look into anger management. There are many techniques that can help you control yourself in a more appropriate manner. If you cannot afford to take anger management classes, then check your local library for books on anger management.

OceWfSbnaa	I'm just curious was this a General Practitioner that cleaned out her ears. I don't really know of to many nerves that are near the exterior of the ear canal. It sounds more like she had an ear infection or they ruptured her canal or tympanic membrane and won't fess up to it. They should have immediately referred her to an ENT to assess the damage and treat her. Instead it sounds like they are covering their mistake by making a huge one. Get a copy of her medical records from there. By law they have to give you a cop. You may have to pay but again by law there is a cap on how much they are allowed to charge. Then take those records and see a specialist. Such as a Ear Nose and Throat doctor. They will take a look at the damage that has been done and treat her accordingly. The only way you could seek legal advise is if a new doctor has indicated that there has been any permanent damage done to her ear and they committed malpractice.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	See an attorney!!

gfHutvEFaa	A sexually transmitted disease that is highly contagious. You can get herpes from your boyfriend's penis AND his mouth.<br>  <br>  If someone has a cold sore on their mouth, and they perform oral sex on you, you will get herpes on your vagina or penis.<br>  <br>  BE VERY CAREFUL and ask lots of questions and be aware .|`|loqsl5xXaa	there is 2 types <br>  <br>  1st: is the kind you get on your lips (cold sore) bacteria from a cold/flu and or from a fever. <br>  <br>  2nd: and std cause by a virus<br>  <br>  also here thought this summed it up pretty well<br>  <br>  Herpes simplex viruses -- more commonly known as herpes -- are categorized into two types: herpes type 1 (HSV-1, or oral herpes) and herpes type 2 (HSV-2, or genital herpes). Most commonly, herpes type 1 causes sores around the mouth and lips (sometimes called fever blisters or cold sores). HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum. Although HSV-2 sores may occur in other locations, these sores usually are found below the waist.<br>  <br>  Herpes simplex type 1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection. It is important to know that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread even if sores are not present.|`|brSfRLspaa	a virus responsible for the STD  and coldsores and shingles and chicken pox|`|7bdcb2934c147a075b450657963145f5aa	sores around  the gentail area or around ur mouth. its not cureable.<br>  <br>  you deff dont want it|`|mBww6ECtaa	a virus you def dont want|`|S1jddreQaa	A STD that you don't want.

9b3xkt36aa	Hyperventilation is the body trying to force out as much carbon dioxide as possible from the body...When you hyperventilate more carbon dioxide is pushed out and oxygen is sucked in.  But eventually the body gets "over oxygenated" and the brain decides that no more oxygen is required...this is why the symptoms include the sensation of being unable to breath.  It's like the body is trying to conserve Carbon Dioxide to balance out.<br>  <br>  When you hold your breath your pulse sky rockets...but here's why:  Heart rate and the need to breath are based on the acidity of the blood...holding your breath makes you hypoxic and Carbon Dioxide increases causing your blood to be more acidic.  The body attempts to adjust for this by increasing the heart rate because it's trying to max out on oxygen delivery to tissues thus decreasing the pH level in the body.  Body was designed around breathing...not for holding your breath!

gkqmrIAGaa	I am so terribly sorry for the abuse and depression that you have suffered in your life, If your mother attempted suicide it sounds like there is serious depression in your family as it can be genetic. Also the abuse sexual and physical, being in group homes and foster homes may have caused you to have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or something called Borderline Personality Disorder only a psychiatrist can give you a correct diagnosis and treat you. There is help you are suicidal. There are medications and therapy that can help you live a life without this pain. There are two numbers that you can call for help right now they are staffed with professionals who are trained to help you right now and give you advise as to what you can do to help yourself and how and where to get help one is 1-800-273-talk and the other is 1-800-suicide. There is a site you can read that was written by someone who was feeling just like you it is a wonderful thing to read and extremely helpful <a href="http://www.metanoia.org./suicide" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org./suicide</a>  Please take a moment and read it. You have to keep your mind on the fact that your daughter needs you and you don't want her to grow up with the knowledge that her mom committed suicide. In your lonlliness and feelings of hopelessness there is help you have to reach out. You cannot handle this by yourself you have to have professional help. For your daughter please do this and for yourself so that you can live a normal life and raise a happy daughter. If you don't do everything that you can do to help yourself your daughter will be sick also. If you take the Clonazapam as it is prescribed to you it will help you calm down until you get help.

After that, you can then do something to change how you are thinking through a variety of different ways, therapy like talk therapy (talking helps loads) or like cbt which helps you realize how your thinking can be incorrect at times like saying for example I suck I'm a failure to realizing at times you may fail but at other times you also succeed...and there is also medication though if you are feeling you might take more than you are supposed to i would ask your doctor(psychiatrist) to write weekly scripts or have it at the pharmacy but like weekly so you are less likely to take large quantities at a time...but medication can still help as well but be patient it does take time...i might also suggest informing any of your friends on maybe just as little info as you are having a hard time right now, can we hang out for a little while sometime or a lot more info to get some of that out...no one will have all the answers out there for you but asking for help is a very large step in the right direction...and if you think about it also everyone is screwed up in their own special ways and are hiding their 'what they consider character flaws or baggage' til they meet someone whom they can trust with all their deformities....but everyone is screwed up in their own particular way...hope one of the people on here made you feel a little better...|`|ppTbSXxOaa	See a therapist immediately.<br>  Don't let your kids lose their mom and end up in foster homes too.

zMD0VeOmaa	1st of all I would remember that you're not alone in how you feel. Millions of people including myself are battling depression. <br>  <br>  There are lots of things you can do to help yourself feel better. Have you thought about exercising? Running will release endorphins that will give you a natural high. Exercise also helps circulation, which will increase blood flow to your genitals and to your brain.<br>  <br>  If your boyfriends lives so far away and you don't get to see him that often I would suggest making some new friends. Have you thought about joining a club or signing up to participate in something in your community?

Y26eOD9Caa	Try a weight gain powder, in conjunction with weightlifting.  Go as heavy as you can, with a low amount of reps.  When you start to get to your desired weight, wean yourself off the powder, and start to lift lighter weight for more reps, and add in some cardio for muscular endurance and definintion. Be careful using weight gain powders.  If you use them for too long, you could start to develop too much fat, as some of these powders have well over 3000 calories in one serving.  Continue to eat small, sensible meals in conjunction with the powder.  When I was into weightlifting in my teens and early twenties, this worked for me, as I too was a hardgainer.  Everyone's body works differently, however.  What worked for me might not work for you, but it's a starting point, at least.|`|KYU2Yl8Waa	Eat meat.|`|DOcjGDVQaa	Eat lots of protein.Chicken is less heart clogging that  red meat or you can buy flavoured protein powder and supplements. <br>  <br>  Do lots of weights.

When you already get used to only eat 800 calories per day, your body will adapt to it and its metabolic rate will also become slower. So if you “get out” from this program and you eat normally, you will gain your weight back fast.<br>  <br>  Our body needs some time to adapt with what we eat. If we eat 2,000 calories per day, our body will store energy to burn those calories and convert the excess calories as fats. If your body gets use to 800 calories per day and you suddenly increase this number only in one day, your body won’t have enough energy to burn all these calories. So it means you will get fat again in a few weeks.<br>  <br>  One more, your body will lose water because you eat too few calories. To avoid this, you must eat enough calories every day but don’t eat too much. Decrease your proportion of meal a little bit. Let’s say if today you eat 1,700 calories, 7 days from now eat 1,600 calories. Then one week later eat 1,500 calories. Just don’t restrict yourself, minimum you must eat 1,400 calories every day.<br>  <br>  Also another way to make sure you get enough calories is to snack healthier between meals. When I say snack healthier, I don't mean eat on whole wheat crackers and low fat cheese. I'm talking about even healthier options (apples help curb your hunger and keep you feeling fuller longer). A handful of nuts, baby carrots, apples, fruit salad, or 2 tbsp of peanut butter with celery are just a few examples of what I go for when in a snacking mood. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.|`|7toznquyaa	No.. you're body needs about 1200 calories just to survive in a healthy state. <br>  Cut out junk food, eat complex carbs (minimally) and a combination of Fats, fiber and proteins.  <br>  <br>  Be careful, even fresh fruits have plenty of calories (and become carbs) and veggies are carbs as well.  <br>  <br>  I use a website called nutrawatch to determine a healthy menu for the day. <br>  www.nutrawatch.com|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	yes, it way to few calories to stay healthy.|`|e1f0EhRNaa	First of all, that's awesome! It's SO good for you to cut out junk foods from your diet, I know but sometimes I just can't resist! And yes, with that amount, your metabolism and your bodies ability to burn fat cells will suffer. You should consume about 1200 calories daily, in 6 small meals. Your metabolism needs calories to keep it going. However, if it's not all the time, 800 calories should be good if it keeps you full. You have a lot of will power! Keep it up!|`|83205fb34700949ba53315bffc459748aa	it is definitely not healthy to only eat 800 calories a day. your body needs at least 1200 to survive. so when you eat less than that, your body systems start to shut down and your body goes into starvation mode. you might not feel hungry, but your body needs more. it will wreak havoc on your metabolism and you will actually not loose weight, and may even gain weight. if you're filling up on lots of carrots or salad or something like that, then try a chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread or something, to up your calories.|`|tuNQSlaFaa	Calories is a large topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three things: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a specific activity expends every sixty minutes, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories.

ijNy8JvZaa	It could be Keratosis Pilaris, it's a hereditary skin disorder that a lot of people have.  I have it, and it sucks because there is no cure.  Fortunately for some, though, it can improve with age.  It is the most prominent during adolescence and during the teen years, but for some it starts to clear up a little later on.(some have said that when they entered their mid twenties they noticed that it was less noticeable)  There is some really useful information about it on this site that can help you determine whether or not that is the problem:<br>  <a href="http://www.helpforkp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpforkp.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can find some info and the symptoms here:<br>  <a href="http://www.helpforkp.com/keratosis_pilaris_about_kp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpforkp.com/keratosis_pilar...</a><br>  <br>  And pictures in case you want to compare:<br>  <a href="http://www.helpforkp.com/keratosis_pilaris_pictures.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpforkp.com/keratosis_pilar...</a><br>  <br>  If you do have it one thing you can do is try to moisturize it with lotion (it helps)  One really good moisturizer is Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair Cream.  Don't try to physically exfoliate the skin with things like lofa sponges.  Those can be too abrasive and can make it worse.  The Eucerin lotion I mentioned has things in it that exfoliates the skin for you, which will give you good results.<br>  <br>  If it's not Keratosis Pilaris, thank your lucky stars and be sure to see a dermatologist to see what the problem is and what you can do about it.  I had a doctor tell me I was ZINC deficient, but even after taking Zinc for 6 months there was very little improvement.  It's actually better in the summer time.  In the winter there is less moisture in the air and dryness can make Keratosis Pilaris look worse (which is why moisturizing the skin is a good idea, it’s better to put lotions and creams on right after a shower)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
949ab8f3fcab8e9a9d4d00acc398def9aa	It is important that you follow a "normal" sleeping pattern that is typical for you. While I personally would not recommend sleeping for a few hours in the middle of the day and staying up later, if that is what your body is used to on a day to day basis then yes. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, no.<br>  <br>  Your body has something called a "circadian rhythm" and it's important to keep it consistant with your sleep and wake cycle. It's easier for your body to rest and progress through the different stages of sleep if it's on a 'normal' sleeping schedule. <br>  <br>  Having 6-8 hours of UNINTERRUPTED sleep is best to provide your body the ways it rejuvinates itself while you sleep. Uniterrupted sleep is best for cognitive functioning, physical functiong, and better immunity. <br>  <br>  However. if you must sleep during the day-limit it to an hour maximum and go to bed earlier if you are that tired.
dEMPrzLaaa	when you hurt yourself during games, sometimes your adrenaline and other bodily hormones take over the pain and you feel nothing. After though, ouch!

Sozc3MyFaa	The first answer was good.  Go in with a list of your symptoms & when they occur (if you can pinpoint the symptoms to any one thing); any over the counter meds & herbals etc you take; other symptoms you may have (weight gain, dry hair etc); if anything makes you feel better or worse etc.  The more info you can bring to the appt the more info your doc has.  Write it all down so they can refer to it, it keeps you on track & nothing gets left out.|`|AA10287830	Make a note of everything you want to tell and ask her.  Think of all the possible questions you might have and write them down.  If she makes light of either complaint keep telling her it is important that you get these issues resolved.  You are paying for her time so don't let her short change you on the time spent or time answering your questions.  Be ready to ask questions if she suggests medications, such as, what does this drug do, what are the side effects, how long will I be on the medication, etc.  If she sends you to therapy for your fatigue which a lot of doctors do now be ready to ask questions about that also.  Seeing you with a list of questions will let her know that you are an active participant in your health care and she will respect you for that and probably end up spending more time answering your questions.  Good luck.|`|949ab8f3fcab8e9a9d4d00acc398def9aa	be honest and open and straightforward with what you want to know. <br>  <br>  Do not be shy, ashamed or afraid of your questions; chances are they are very common questions they recieve on a day to day basis and they have the resources available to answer your questions. <br>  <br>  If it makes your feel more at ease, I suggest writing down the specific topics you want to discuss or questions you want to ask if you get nervous while being in the office, that way you do not forget.

The fact that she is hiding, according to your words, is interesting too.|`|GBZQP5pAaa	I don't think it is toxic, but it is definitely not good for her. I was in child care for 6 years, and I've seen plenty of children eat chalk with no health crisis. Just try to prevent the child from eating chalk.|`|84fm2GXOaa	eating chalk is like eating tums, just dont eat alot of it...|`|I5SypMlsaa	only in big pieces|`|EWR01atlaa	Well it can be dangerous. I mean yeah it's not food and of course if you eat enough of it you could get sick. my sister did that once and she threw up. So i guess it could be dangerous to her health. It's just like if she ate a crayon. Sure it's non-toxic, but she still shouldn't eat it.<br>  And the thing is, it's probably going to be really hard to get her to stop. But my suggestion is that you watch her more carefully. And put the chalk in a high up area where she can't reach it. It's kinda wierd that a 10 year old would do that though. You'd think she'd know better.. haha<br>  -M|`|KSK22vHUaa	It's non-toxic.  She'll be fine.  Worst case scenario, tummy-ache. <br>  <br>  At ten years old, she should know better.  Is she developmentally challenged in some way?  If not, talk to her about it like an adult and tell her if she's hungry, you can get her a snack.  If she is a bit behind, admonish her like a younger child and take the chalk away.<br>  <br>  Either way, speak with her parents about this.  It's fairly strange to hide and eat chalk.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	If she is eating a lot of it, it will mess up the acidity of her stomach (essentially making it more nuetral) which can mess up her digestion. It won't kill her if she's only eating a couple of pieces, but obviously you should probably let the girl's parents know and take away the chalk.|`|1f603110fae30efb6841a9827a36016aaa	No chalk has been given to help induce vomiting. It's calcium carbonate and maybe she craves it because he has a calcium deficiency in her diet. give her a big glass of milk each time you babysit.|`|bx4H0KqQaa	Well, yes...<br>  It might be non-toxic but it still has like bacteria and all of that stuff on it.<br>  She could get like sick from it.<br>  So ya....|`|uqjEXAOmaa	i doubt it's dangerous, but, it's kinda weird|`|C7PcIZv9aa	its dangerous!
MSqE9rbDaa	This is completely normal. Your periods are still very irregular. Don't worry about it.|`|16bWGB14aa	Yes it's normal. When I first got mine at one point I had two periods in one month. You just started menstruating and it will take a year or two for your cycle to be regular because your body isn't use to it yet. Don't worry.|`|HtPX4uEMaa	First of all, if you're bleeding you aren't pregnant. And if you're a virgin, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  You just got your first period a few months ago so there's no knowing whats "regular" for it yet or "usual". You're just starting, in a few years it will balance out and come regularly.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out. It's going to do that a lot. You may even miss one or two periods sometimes, and don't freak unless you've reason to (being active).|`|46RT8b5Maa	when u first get ur period they tend to be really irregular. it will take about a year to actually figure out what the schedule is and when they're coming and stuff.  and btw if u DONT get ur period, thats what could mean ur pregnant. not the other way around. and anyway if u havent had sex than u cant get pregnant anyway.|`|am906CQcaa	First off all I applaud you for keeping track of your cycle so well! When you first start getting your period it takes awhile for your body to fully adjust and get a normal cycle so you may a few cycles that are out of whack. Don't worry about it too much! =)
7Ux4ucwGaa	i would try the black head eraser thing because a great company makes it.  wash your face daily and use special cleaners too.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	scrub & SQUEEEZE.!|`|N1BHGZpwaa	Dont use bar soap. it clogs the pores. But get some type of facial cleanser and use it everyday. Other than that, make a mixture of baking soda, a little bit of honey and lemon and then water to form a paste. Slop it on there massaging it into your nose, chin, etc. Wait a while and wash off. My face looks better already after doing it only once.<br>  good luck!|`|XK2nz4zyaa	Most people do have blackheads on their noses. If you want to try and shrink them put a acne fighting salicylic acid cream on them before bed. This will hopefully dry them out and shrink them. Biore makes pore strips for your nose. These will pull the blackheads out, but only if they are ready. Personally I find the pore strips don't work very well at all. In the beauty section of most stores you should be able to find a pore extractor... its a little metal tool with two loops on either end of it. If you can find one of these then you just need to press and glide it over the area you have blackheads. <br>  <br>  If you want to try really desperate measures, laser skin treatments are supposed to work well for pore extraction.|`|8gCJVFG3aa	Wash Your Face Daily.<br>  Use Face Packs And Stuff.<br>  You Cant Reelii Help Having Open Pores.|`|dnoQPOcCaa	there is a face washer called blackhead eraser.. made by clearasel.

PGkR813Jaa	I had this when I was 16 and it was extremely painful.<br>  <br>  Mine was going to be operated on to drain fluid but rest, ice and anti-inflammatories and pain killers helped. But I still do have trouble with it now and then.<br>  <br>  Has the Doctor put you on anti-inflammatories? He should have tried these. If not he.she will.<br>  <br>  If it was caused by an infection you should have also been tried on antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Surgery to remove, and make it feel so much better quickly, to remove excess fluid may be warranted.<br>  <br>  They won't usually cast it as this can make it more painful and stiff.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell what sort of pain meds he/she will prescribe as it depends on your health. Conditions. weight etc.<br>  <br>  A Chiropractor would be making it feel worse. As movement aggravates the condition.<br>  A Physiotherapist is a better bet for treatment.
wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.<br>  <br>  Monday- biceps triceps and shoulders/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Tuesday – cardio 1hr and 15 min/abs<br>  Wednesday - chest back and abs/ cardio for 65 minutes<br>  Thursday cardio 1 hour and 15 minutes<br>  Friday- legs/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Saturday- cardio hour and 15 minutes/ abs<br>  Sunday- off<br>  This routine has helped me lose 70 lbs of fat and 16 inches off my entire body and gain 45 lbs of muscle after having a baby. I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though).

xbOjNKRFaa	The gum should eventually heal by itself. Things in the mouth heal very quickly usually within one to two weeks. so if it has not healed by then go see your dentist. Sounds like you may have just cut you gum a little on something. It happens. Make sure while the area is healing you are keeping if clean by brushing often, gently in that area. Flossing the area gently and using a good mouth rinse like Crest Pro Health rinse.|`|fifEyApIaa	Make sure you rinse it with warm salt water~it will be fine!|`|SwXD8uCoaa	I think you chewed on something that caused the laceration.

BPuyPpNkaa	Our bodies are geared to be able to tolerate a certain amount of germs.  Certainly wash your hands after going to the toilet or blowing your nose.  Maybe you should start using a hand lotion to help keep your hands from getting any drier.  Suave makes a really good water-based lotion that doesn't feel greasy or sticky once you rub it in.  I'm a registered nurse, so I know first hand what you're going through with irritated skin from all the hand washing.  Try lotion on your hands.  You'll notice a huge difference within a few days.|`|L0EKlaZ8aa	use germ x that is what i do i use the stuff all the time!! my hands smell good and stay clean.

The best you can do is separate yourself from the relationship and tell him you will be there when he gets help. Otherwise, you really are just being an enabler. My mother stayed with my dad through 22 years of heroin addiction, and there is really nothing you can do for them until they decide a change needs to happen. I feel your pain and sorry you're being put through this.|`|do5uBviyaa	1 - Understand addiction in order to help addicts<br>  #2 - Get help yourself in order to help the addict<br>  This is what most people think of when they hear the term “intervention,” where the friends and family of an addict all get together and confront that person together and urge them to get help. This is not necessarily the best choice though. There is a lot of evidence that an addict or alcoholic will only change when they personally come to their own point of surrender. A formal intervention does not bring a person to this point. Many would argue that the intervention would only work if the person is already at this critical point of surrender. Nevertheless, some formal interventions have been successful at persuading people to get clean and sober

I've known people with constant headaches, their neck didn't hurt at all, and after one session with the chiropractor the pain went away.

A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.|`|LsHkgexvaa	Meditation, low lights, and calming music. always works for me.

I'm not sure, but it could be effected by how much water you drink, but people often get dehydrated on MDMA, so its a good idea to always drink plenty of water.  Yes, eating before taking MDMA could decrease the effectiveness a bit, but I think the more likely reason it wasn't as intense for you was your metabolism.  Some people simply have a higher tolerance for certain drugs.
b303NtYsaa	I had a pimple around my lips too. Do Not pop it, whatever you do. If you use a cream to take care of it, place a tiny dap directly on the pimple.

vGxipYJnaa	You're right that those aren't cold sores. Her lips are just sensitive - and they react to the oil on your lips. It's not an allergy, it's actually pretty normal. She may want to use chapstick after a lot of kissing because her lips may become dry and irritated otherwise.
KNbk23Iraa	hey lad, if you can get your hands on an exercise ball like a 55cm diameter 1 you should do it. cause you do sit ups on those and you wont be able to do 100. I had a no six pack then i started doing these sit ups on the ball and i got an 8 pack in like 1 and a half months. it also depends on your diet. Eat lots of protein, Chicken, steak and eggs. Try stay away from bread and pasta ect. Do this and you will have shreddid abbs in no time. If its no go with the ball. Do sit up twists on the ground with a 5kg weight on your chest.

5fdgfNCRaa	I'm willing to bet you're okay.<br>  Herpes look like canker sores. Canker sores are unrelated, however. Sometimes there are little blisters on the inside of your mouth that can be caused by a variety of things. I've gotten these little blisters in my mouth - and I have been getting them for years. They're little, non-painful blisters and they can pop easily and accidentally. <br>  If you had herpes, you would know it because the sores are extremely painful.<br>  If your eyelid still hurts, go see a doctor. There is acid in soda and it could've irritated your eye. Even more likely, something could've just gotten in your eye and caused it to hurt. If you wear contacts, this is even more likely, but if not, I'm still quite sure that it's just an irritant, not a virus.<br>  <br>  As for this nurse, I find her extremely irresponsible to just say "It's probably herpes," and just leave it at that. If he/she really believed that, she would've continued to do a test - any nurse would know the pain that comes along with herpes sores and would've done a test to see if that were in fact the case so you could get on meds to quicken the healing process.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned, go to a walk-in clinic and have them check you out. <br>  You'll be fine, I'm sure :)|`|ryitG21Yaa	i think you just been biting yourself in your sleep. your eyes hurt because of the carbonation and acid in the soda. unless someone jizzed in the soda you didnt get it from that and if you have had secks lately ask the person if he/she had herpes|`|9b3xkt36aa	Dude...chill out!!!

t2x7Cr6Gaa	Im not sure but this is an interesting question.|`|nEVoabeSaa	The research cements the critical role of the mu opioid system, in which naturally produced chemicals called endogenous opioids, or endorphins, match up with receptors on the surface of brain cells and reduce or block the spread of pain messages from the body through the brain. Opioids also play a role in feelings of pleasure and reward, and in responses to stressful situations, and may even be involved in the "runner's high" felt during strenuous exercise.<br>  <br>  More recently, specific endogenous opioids such as the so-called endorphins and enkephalins have been found and studied, as have the various kinds of opioid receptors that dot the surface of brain neurons. Studies have even pieced together the chemical cascade within a neuron that results from the binding of an opioid molecule to its receptor and triggers the neuron to stop sending a pain message - an effect known as antinociception.<br>  <br>  The mu opioid receptor in particular has been found to be a major target for both the body's own painkillers and for drugs from outside the body, such as heroin, morphine, methadone, synthetic pain medications and anesthetics. All are capable of numbing pain, and, in the case of drugs of abuse, produce pleasurable sensations during use.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck
XzksQ3AFaa	The same thing happened to my friend. It took over a year before the scar finally faded to white, but it did eventually. The tone of your skin will greatly impact how it scars, though. As a general rule the darker your skin is, the worse you scar. People with light skin (that is, "white people") usually scar very little, and rarely develop keloid scars. On the other hand, people of Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Asian, or African origin (basically anyone who isn't white) tend to scar more heavily, and are more likely to develop keloids. <br>  <br>  You can try to apply cocoa butter or Mederma scar cream on the spot to help speed up the process, but it could be several more months before you see the scar fade out. It may never go away completely, and it might never look close to what it was before, but if you apply the cream and don't try to repierce it, you should hardly be able to notice it by the summer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zXGTDkZmaa	Coca butter really helps.|`|7Ux4ucwGaa	it will probably go away on its own, eventually but to help it there are creams you can put on it that you should look in to.  they might have those creams at a local drug store.

iK3YYRaTaa	Nick Jonas seems to have everything a guy could want: thousands of adoring fans, a skyrocketing career, and a cool family, including Joe and Kevin, his bandmates in the Jonas Brothers.<br>  <br>  But Nick also has diabetes, a serious health condition that needs daily attention. Now 16, Nick first got sick while on tour in November 2005. He was losing weight, acting moody, and feeling thirsty all the time. A blood test showed that he had diabetes and he spent several days in the hospital. Though he is healthy and feeling great now, back then he worried he might die.<br>  <br>  "I had an emotional breakdown since I really had no idea what diabetes was all about. I wondered, 'why me?' Then I asked myself, 'why not me?' and realized that I might be able to help other kids with diabetes."<br>  <br>  In 2007, the Jonas Brothers performed at a Diabetes Research Institute fundraiser in New York City. During the show, Nick asked audience members to raise their hands if they had diabetes. Then he raised his hand, too, revealing for the first time publicly that he has type 1 diabetes.<br>  <br>  Of course, the crowd went wild. He even pulled up his T-shirt sleeve to show the audience the device he wears on his arm to deliver insulin to his body. (People who have diabetes have a problem with a hormone called insulin. Their bodies either don't make enough insulin or the insulin doesn't work as it should. Without insulin, your body can't get the fuel it needs.)<br>  <br>  At the concert, Nick encouraged other kids with diabetes to be positive, adding that he earned the nickname "Mr. Positive" because of his attitude about his condition.<br>  <br>  What causes diabetes? <br>  <br>  Health care providers do not yet know what causes diabetes. The following factors may increase your chance of getting diabetes: <br>  <br>  Family history of diabetes <br>  African-American, Hispanic, Native American or Asian-American race or ethnic background <br>  Being overweight <br>  Age (Chances increase with age) <br>  Taking certain medicines <br>  Being pregnant* <br>  *Pregnancy puts extra stress on a woman's body that causes some women to develop diabetes. Blood sugar levels often return to normal after childbirth. Yet, women who get diabetes during pregnancy have an increased chance of developing diabetes later in life. <br>  <br>  Its life long. And yes you can die from it.|`|AA11727191	You get Type 1 diabetes (What Nick has) when your pancreas produces NO or very little insulin. Which is why Type 1's have to inject insulin or use the insulin pump like he does. They are not sure what causes it for sure yet. Yes it is life-long until there is a cure.

PEN3hha7aa	EXCELLENT job, first of all.  I am not a doctor, but my guess would be that you need to wait long enough for him to have the emotional fortitude to handle and understand just what that means.<br>  <br>  The really good thing is you have your conscience back and the drugs aren't doing the talking anymore.  Reading between the lines tells me you are really sorry for what you did and you wonder if you have hurt him because of it.  The good thing is that he is only 8 years old and as long as you stay off the heroine you both have a long time go grow past this.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert by any means but I would not tell him as long as he is still in school.   The reason I am saying that is if you remember your life through and including high school you will remember how inconsiderate and cruel kids can be at that age.  Your son could just plain want to tell someone else about it and they could rag on him for years about it.  All that would do is add to the problem and neither you nor your son need any more crap to deal with.<br>  <br>  What I am not saying is not to tell him because it sounds like you really want to someday.  The bad thing is he may not like you for it and you will just have to deal with that and be happy inside that you were honest with him.  My idea is to "hedge your bets" and wait till he is  emotionally capable of handling it, but the other side of the coin is that he is young and resilient now and this may be the better time to tell him.<br>  <br>  All I can think of is for you to do what you are doing and get other opinions like you are doing now.  The better thing to do is to talk to someone professionally and ask their advice.  They will know things that we are clueless about...|`|2jMFurDoaa	i dont hate my dad.<br>  <br>  since before i was born until i was about 6 my dad was a heroin addict. i always knew there was something going on but i didnt find out it was drugs until i was about 10, what 6 year old is going to understand heroin. even at 10 i didnt have a full grasp on it but as i got older i started asking questions. my mom didnt try to hide it from me but she didnt tell me every little thing that was going on in his life and when he got straight he told me and my brothers he was doing bad things and he apologized and he has always been very upfront and honest when ever we had a question about it.<br>  <br>  i dont think your son will hate you, your his dad hes gonna love you no matter what, he may be a little freaked and hurt at first just because its scary, just explain it to him the best you can and just remember theres groups like nar-anon he can attend( my whole family went to them.)<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|HYjsxoNaaa	I'm sure he will not hate you for it.

rtrdOcTcaa	Try a larger cup size first.  If it's large enough around your chest underneath your breasts, stay a 34.  If you go up a number you're actually increasing the size of the cup as well, because the letters are proportionate to the numbers: for example, a 32B and a 34A have the same size cup, and a 32DD is bigger than a 34C.  So try a bigger cup size, and if that doesn't work try a bigger number.  Play around with different bras of the same size as well, because not every bra of the right size will be comfortable.  Good luck!|`|VuL0jr1eaa	Go get professionally measured and they will tell you exactly which bra size you should be wearing.

TsjqzanQaa	Herpes almost always appears like little pimples, not as a ring around the glans.<br>  <br>  Do you have a shorter foreskin that normally leaves a part of the glans uncovered, yet covers a part of it?<br>  <br>  That would certainly explain the effect, if the foreskin opening corresponds with the ring on the glans.<br>  <br>  If that is the case, you can stretch the foreskin longer daily to achieve full coverage.<br>  <br>  I was mutilated by circumcision and have achieved a new foreskin by restoration.     It's not yet long enough for complete coverage 24/7, but it's getting there rapidly.<br>  <br>  I know about the partial coverage thing, it's what I experience a lot of the time.|`|Ty35M5Rpaa	o its ok i have 3 of those =)|`|tG0MdSzDaa	You have the Red Ring Of Death...you need to send your penis back to Microsoft.

xYTagSIyaa	TM symptoms develop rapidly over several hours to several weeks.  <br>  <br>  Almost all patients will develop leg weakness of varying degrees of severity.  The arms are involved in a minority of cases and this is dependent upon the level of spinal cord involvement.  Sensation is diminished below the level of spinal cord involvement in the majority of people.  Some experience tingling or numbness in the legs.  Pain and temperature sensation are diminished in the majority of patients.  Bladder an bowel control may be affected.  <br>  <br>  RECOVERY may be absent, partial or complete and generally begins within 1-3months.  If she has not recovered in three months, significant recovery is unlikely.  Most people show fair recovery, lets hope your sister in law is one of them.<br>  <br>  The cause is often a viral infection, it could have been cold sores or Epstein barr virus, which causes MS and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, HIV or polio or coxsackie virus or leukemia or influenza or rabies.  <br>  <br>  It starts from some infection that affects the immune system.<br>  <br>  <br>  nurse---below is a support group web page

Well, taking it "until you get out of the age range" doesn't apply. <br>  <br>  You are never out of the age range for diabetes, because your risk rises as you age, especially with type 2. (Because you have pre-diabetes, you are at risk for type 2, you don't get prediabetes with type 1, it has a rapid onset). <br>  <br>  So if your family members got it early on, you need to be very careful because you are more likely to get it than someone whose family members got it later in life, but you will never be free from risk. <br>  <br>  Your risk won't go down. It will only go up. <br>  <br>  Taking the pill at night is not effective. It needs to be taken before meals. If you are on the slow release form, it should be taken before  supper. <br>  <br>  Digestive problems are common with the first few weeks of Metformin. You need to be more consistent with it, so your stomach can adjust to it and not have to readjust each time you miss a dose. <br>  <br>  Check with your doctor or your pharmacist. I'm sure if they look it up, they'll see that it should be taken before a meal, not at night. <br>  <br>  Before supper if that is the meal with the heaviest carb load or if you are on the time released form. <br>  <br>  If you are regular metformin, you take it before your heaviest carb loaded meal and if that's not enough (its usually not) you will add another dose before each meal, but its done over weeks or months to avoid creating digestive problems. You should be testing your blood sugar to see if its actually having any impact on them. <br>  <br>  <br>  To avoid missing a dose, get a weekly pill holder, it has one compartment for each day. Fill it every Sunday and put it where you eat your supper and make sure you take the tablet every day. Check it before you leave the table from supper, to make sure you took it. <br>  <a href="http://www.diabetesandmore.com/7-Day-Locking-Pill-Reminder-XL-P622C145.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetesandmore.com/7-Day-Loc...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can check this website, you'll see that even the extended release metformin is still supposed to be taken with the evening meal, not at night. It should be taken BEFORE you eat. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drugs.com/metformin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/metformin.html</a><br>  <br>  To help with the digestive problems, I suggest taking some yogurt with your metformin (before you eat supper). I got this suggestion from a well known diabetes group and it has helped a lot of people. Look for a yogurt with NO sugar added. There are a few of them available. The one we use is Danone "No Sugar Added" and it has fruit in it. Tastes great and its low in carbs too, so its fine for diabetics. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS.

KSUPtqCaaa	You should consult your OB before trying any recommendations offered here, particularly medications.<br>  <br>  Just being sick shouldn't be a problem for the baby, and should only be a nuisance to you. For fevers, you can safely take acetaminophen or paracetamol, but should avoid ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are drinking plenty of water, and throw in the occasional Gatorade or other electrolyte replacement drink (maybe one for every 2 liters of water). Also, make sure you are staying up on your prenatal vitamins or other supplements prescribed by your physician.<br>  <br>  Finally, get plenty of bed rest.

Taking extra Tylenol for a high fever will not help reduce it - but it can hurt your liver.<br>  You will want to monitor your fever, that it doesn't go too high and hurt the baby, as well as make sure you get enough fluids so you don't become dehydrated. <br>  Don't take *anything* without talking to your OB first.  Most over-the-counter meds are not proven safe for pregnancy.   Even the stuff you would take without giving it a second thought, needs to be scrutinized before taking it.  A stuffy nose or upset stomach is definitely uncomfortable - but not uncomfortable enough to risk something happening to your baby.   <br>  Another reliable source for safe vs not-safe meds would be your pharmacist.  <br>  Fortunately, your baby is safe in it's little "cocoon", and is blissfully unaware that anything is happening.   :)<br>  I'm sorry you're sick.  :(   I hope you are feeling better soon!|`|eY5AU9CVaa	Tylenol or Tylenol Cold<br>  Warm salt/water gargle<br>  Saline nasal drops or spray<br>  <br>  Sudafed, Actifed, Dristan, Neosynephrine*<br>  <br>  Robitussin DM, Trind-DM, Vicks Cough Syrup, Romilar, Halls*<br>  <br>  *Do not take "SA" (sustained action) forms of these drugs or the "Multi-Symptom" forms of these drugs.

EZ1cPPvkaa	Essentially, yes.  The active ingredient is the same, DXM.  I'm not sure how the amount of DXM in each tablet compares, so you'd have to check that.  The really good thing about Robitussin is that it almost always has only DXM as the active ingredient, which is really good.  Triple C' s, i'm pretty sure, have some stuff in it that can be really dangerous in much lower doses than DXM, so it's never smart to take those or anything else that has other active ingredients than DXM.|`|vlouweLwaa	what are cs?|`|GCYvo1C0aa	no, ccc's has other **** besides dxm in it which is bad for you. i.e. dont take tripple c's theyre no good<br>  <br>  just get a bottle of Robitussin and make sure on the back it says the only active ingredient is dxm, and have fun.|`|2lx4cgYPaa	pretty much, but triple C's are dangerous to do because of the other ingredients in them

This person robbed you of your innocence and joy as a child, are you really going to let them ruin your adulthood too?<br>  Do they deserve such high respect from you, that you would give them such power over you? Once you realize the fact that you are still letting them bully you even now as an adult, if you have any self respect at all, that should really tick you off, and make you determined not to let them ruin another day of your life. <br>  First, get really mad, yell, scream, whatever it takes to vent, get it all out. Then allow yourself to stop feeling guilty because you didn't stand up for yourself and put a stop to the bullying. Forgive yourself, you weren't at fault, you were a victim. Next, stop feeling sorry for yourself, because you were a victim, it's over, you are safe now. You've learned how not to be a victim again, right? Wrong, you are still allowing yourself to be victimized by the very same bully as when you were a kid. <br>  The next step after you forgive yourself, is to forgive the bully/bullies. Only then can you truly be free of the pain that was inflicted on you at such an early age. You must realize that bullies are really more scared than you are. They have either been bullied themselves, and most likely were abused either physically, sexually, or mentally. They most likely didn't feel loved, or wanted by their parents, so they made themselves feel better and powerful by taking it out on someone who may have seemed weaker than they were, or who they were jealous of. They may have thought you were better looking, or had a better home life, you may never know what made them pick you as their prey.<br>  All you have to know is that bullies build themselves up, by tearing down others. It's been this way, since time began, and there will always be bullies. You're not so special as you think, most of us have had our own personal bully too. It's how you deal with it, that makes you weak or stronger. They were the ones with the real issues, and you have taken on their issues and made them yours. You have punished yourself long enough for not knowing how to fight back. It doesn't mean you were truly weak, or a frightened little coward, as you might think of yourself. It just means that you were too gentle and kind to hurt someone else back. You were a good person, who just couldn't be as mean and ugly as they were to you. Forgive yourself, and forgive them. That is the way back to the path that you were on before these bullies side tracked you, sending you on a completely different journey in your life. It's time to get back on track, and continue on your road to self discovery, and to fulfilling your dreams, free of any more nightmares from the distant past.<br>  If this is of no help to you, then please seek professional counseling, they can really help with many issues.|`|uY8yP8EPaa	I sometimes feel similar to that, I wasn't popular or anything in school but I do have some close friends.  <br>  Would you consider counseling or seeing a psychiatrist?

Maybe you could ask them and talk it through with them -- they have plenty of life experience.  <br>  I really hope the best for you!|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Get a referal from your doctor for counciling or speak with a minister, priest or rabbi depending on your church background, they are training in counciling also.

59394a1b605823a8a42f1427df951f78aa	Hey there again.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would stop taking Fertil Plus.  This is my opinion, but the first two things I saw in the ingredient list were Black Cohosh, and Dong Quai.  Secondarily, I saw Siberian Ginseng.<br>  <br>  Black Cohosh is notorious for terminating pregnancies, and is often used to do precisely that for individuals attempting a natural abortion.  The only real problem herein lies that Black Cohosh is damaging to your liver, can cause heart dysfunction, and will bottom out your blood pressure if you're not careful.  Black Cohosh is also toxic in certain quantities.  This is not good stuff.  It could very likely make you auto-terminate any fertilization that might occur.<br>  <br>  Dong Quai, while having some useful qualities (such as possible estrogen-like effects), can cause you to have uterine difficulties.  It also tends to lower your blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Siberian Ginseng is okay in moderation, but it can have an effect on your blood pressure, too.<br>  <br>  So, yes, to answer your question, is what you're taking likely to make you have high blood pressure or to make it rise?  It's entirely possible.  I would say, however, that it has a better chance to make your blood pressure drop drastically.  You'll probably also sweat while using this stuff, and you might even feel feverish at some point.  You might also make sure that you reduce your time in the sun while using this, as several ingredients in it can cause you severe sensitivity to light.  After all of this, I haven't even mentioned possible contraindications that could occur when using this stuff with other medications.<br>  <br>  My suggestion for you is to get rid of this stuff, and start taking some other things that are not toxic, are nourishing to your body and your reproductive system, and will also promote fertility.  I'll give you some examples in a moment, but make sure, just like with this other stuff, that you find out if anything you are currently taking will interact.<br>  <br>  Red Clover Blossom:  this will help promote fertility, and is full of healthy minerals that will nourish your body.  Red Clover works well adding in mints, too, like peppermint or spearmint (real plants, not flavorings).  Do not take Pennyroyal under any circumstance.  I only mention this because it's in the mint family.<br>  <br>  Nettle Leaves:  this helps to regulate and promote a strong, healthy hormonal system, which is absolutely necessary for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Chaste Tree:  also known as Vitex agnus-castus, helps to promote ovulation by regulating and enhancing pituitary function.  It also helps to minimize the chance of miscarriage.  This is also present in Fertil Plus, and quite possibly the only truly helpful thing in the mix.<br>  <br>  Raspberry Leaves:  this helps to nourish uterine function and is safe throughout pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E:  taking 500 to 1500 IU daily of Vitamin E can help regulate hormonal systems and thereby help your chances of fertility.<br>  <br>  Adding all of these together, along with monitoring your cycles, will help you increase your fertility, minimize health risks, and maximize health benefits.  None of the things I've mentioned are bad for your heart, body, or systems, and none of the things I've recommended inherently have side effects (other than making you more healthy AND boosting your hormone levels/uterine function).<br>  <br>  You and your guy might also look into zinc, as zinc is important to creating seminal and vaginal fluid, both of which are helpful and/or necessary for pregnancy.  Don't overdo it on the zinc, though.  Pumpkin seeds are a good source of zinc.  I wouldn't necessarily take a zinc supplement, but a good multivitamin is always a smart choice.<br>  <br>  You're gonna have to get in the mode of taking vitamins and keeping yourself healthy if you want to be a new mom, anyway.<br>  <br>  So, shopping list (you should be able to easily get all of these things at a vitamin store, such as Vitamin Shoppe, etc.): <br>  <br>  Red Clover Blossom<br>  Peppermint or Spearmint<br>  Nettle Leaves<br>  Chaste Tree (Vitex agnus-castus)<br>  Raspberry Leaves<br>  Multi-Vitamin (containing zinc and Vitamin E)<br>  <br>  Good luck with the whole thing, and please, get rid of that Fertil Plus. :-)
1oNMgszMaa	It's perfectly normal. Mine changes from the darkest of greys to the brightest of blues. It usually depends on the lighting surrounding me... It's normal. dw|`|T4uZeVXjaa	It means you are in different lighting conditions.  Light eyes reflect the ambient light and will change colour from lighter to darker depending upon surroundings and pupil size.|`|zAN9JV4kaa	OMG i HATE when people say their eyes change colors!!!!! i dont know why i just doo!! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|k0D4TOOtaa	It probably depends on the colour of shirt you're wearing; different-coloured shirts bring out the different tones and hues in your eyes. So your eyes don't really change colour - it's just your perception of you eye colour with respect to your surroundings that changes. Think of it this way: if you wear a red shirt and enter a red room, your shirt won't stand out as much as if you had entered a blue room. So if you wear a blue shirt, your eyes may look more blue; if you wear a gray or green one, your eyes may look more gray or blue, respectively (it's kinda different from the room example, but it's all based on the principle of perception).|`|hYxoIVwRaa	If your eyes change colors, than they are considered hazel.
MpVQE8tnaa	You have an allergy to metal...try hydrocortisone cream 1% most drugstores have it<br>  <br>  You can not wear cheap metals anymore....rings, belts, earings, necklaces etc....|`|sHB9a7P3aa	Go to a doctor.
SltEwVX7aa	maybe you woke up just before you were gonna shoot.<br>  <br>  yeah, a wet dream usually involves you having an orgasm and shooting semen (or it may be a dry shoot if you're not 'developed' yet.)|`|BAlYRNN8aa	Wet dreams usually consist of semen, so maybe you just really had to pee lol.
ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	Once you have HPV you have it, there is no cure.  However, many women have it all their lives and never are made ill by it.  What you do need to do is have a PAP smear every single year without fail to make sure you are not developing cervical cancer.|`|GLjPiXBSaa	it wont kill u if u tke care of it. it can cause alot of problems like infertility(not able to have babies) so go 2 a gyno and ask questions b responsible do the mature thing and get informed.
mqXyDTwwaa	Sorry, no. Fat distribution is genetic. I'm the same way.|`|fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	Its called weight gain supplements, NO STEROIDS, and a exercise regiment meant to increase muscle mass. There are no such things as a magical pill or product that will let you gain muscle mass while sitting down or playing video games. I was  almost identical to you in high school, I was 5'10 and weighed 122. I tried EVERYTHING, then I started eating higher fat foods, in moderation, and lifting a little weights and now I am 30 years old, and weigh 165 lbs and in VERY good shape, you just have to keep at it and not get frustrated.|`|qc9DGQucaa	you have to get comfortable with your body. its what god gave you. but you can modify somethings. but if you cant then live with it. wear clothes to hide it.|`|wPXLu1zaaa	i heard when you eat standing up the food goes to your legs.|`|8QE30IXkaa	shake around
8q82dLS8aa	If you drink and eat before surgery, the drugs can make you sick, like, throw up. That's all.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Yes, he can drink that.  However, his doctor has also told him not to eat or drink ANYTHING past midnight the day of surgery.  <br>  <br>  Some people can react to anaesthesia, and they don't want him vomiting anything into the mask during the operation.  <br>  <br>  If he drinks or eats anything, the surgery can be canceled.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	NPO or nothing per orem is a standard procedure before operations to prevent /NV or nausea and vomiting which will give other complications to the client. It is best to follow what your doctors say before the operation to prevent complications.|`|XzksQ3AFaa	Gatorade is fine as a fluid to drink before surgery. Surgeons usually do not want you to eat before surgery because some people's gag reflex is stimulated when they go under anesthesia and/or are intubated. They don't want the patient to vomit the contents of their stomach and choke to death, because when they are unconscious they won't be able to clear their windpipe like they would be if they were choking while conscious.|`|DjyqUSjRaa	the gatorade he drank is actually what they suggest. and if he ate anything he should let them know and they might want to postpone it. the reason they ask u not to eat anything is because when under anesthesia the body relaxes. all the muscles in the anus relax and it becomes common for a person to have bowel movements. its not awful, but they do try to avoid it. i wouldn't worry to much though about eating something.<br>   however they ask u drink transparent liquids because anything red or something like soda coats the stomach and makes it harder for them to see when they need to be. <br>  <br>  hope this helps and tell ur dad good luck!|`|AA11705584	i think its to prevent him from vomiting when under the anesthetic.|`|0Baz2MPdaa	Primarily because it can cause an interaction with general anesthesia leading to your dad potentially throwing up.  During surgery this is dangerous because he will be lying down so it will be easy for him to inhale the vomit.  In addition, stomach digestion during surgery would not be a good idea and since he is being operated on his intestines the doctor/surgeon probably doesn't want to see digesta (digested food) in the surgery site causing potential contamination and making the surgery more difficult.  <br>  <br>  Check with the doctor if drinking gatorade is ok.  Usually when they say transparent fluids this means water.|`|HHyiLfAjaa	OMG ru SERIOUS?! if he was told NOT to eat or drink anything then he should have listen like a BIG BOY SHOULD! .... if something happens during the surgery then hes screwed depending if they nick his bowel with a knife or if he throws up during the surgery and chocks and dies because he ate something! GOD WHY DONT PEOPLE LISTEN!!!! EVEN KNOWING THAT IT COULD MEEN LIFE OR DEATH OMFG!!!<br>  and no the lemon lime is ok ... as long it is NOT red blue or purple dyes.|`|1sOWpQR2aa	Any kind of liquids or food in his stomach when they use the IV and other things during surgery will make him very sick and they may not be able to continue the surgery if he does. If he drank or ate with 8 hours of the surgery, you should think about calling it off.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	They advise nothing to eat/drink so that if there is any nausea associated with the anesthetic used, there wont be much to potentially throw up or asperate into the lungs. They also do not want to have any thing interfere with tests or discolor normal body fluids.|`|5lZbY4hFaa	If you eat or drink after midnight of the day of surgery they will call off the surgery. The anesthesia will make the person very sick and most likely they will vomit. They need to have an empty stomach for surgery.|`|hYoyzVuwaa	the surgery should be called off depending on the magnitude because when in surgery the body can't be controlled by the mind. it does everything on an automatic mode and digesting food may bring a person to his death|`|jKUFXzp9aa	THE REAL ANSWER IS BECASUE YOU WILL  ASPERATE ( THROW UP) AND IT GO INYO YOUR LUNGS. AND YOUR GAG REFLEX IS ALSO PUT TO SLEEP WHEN YOU ARE.............
cASB8Sh3aa	One part of mental illness is that the person suffering from it has very little insight into their own illness and severity of it.  You will need treatment as you have two major things going on here (eating disorder and self injury).  It sounds like treating yourself isn't working as you still have these issues.  You need a professional who is objective and trained to help you.  You will probably need medication as well as depression is typically part of these illnesses.  You can totally overcome this, lean on professionals and take this time to take care of yourself.|`|6e0PG4YWaa	You need to get professional help beyond your regular doctor.  If you have had an eating disorder for about 7 years, you are only to continue damaging your body physically as well as mentally.  There is a great treatment facility called Recovery Connection.  If you want to take a look at the website and get some general information about it I'll give you the link.  Good luck to you!|`|inA6ZLeAaa	you need help immeadiately.
OZBkd2BDaa	This is totally normal buddy, when I was 12-now I masturbated everyday and sometimes four or five times a day, now I'm older and in a sexual relationship I have sex mostly but still masturbate sometimes, and still 3 or 4 times if I'm in the mood, basically what I'm saying is that every body have different sexual needs, some don't feel horny enough to masturbate even twice a week but then theres also some people that need sex and masturbation two three four and some times for some people need even more, but its all normal in the fact that if you are horny and want to then there is nothing wrong... and you see the reason you might have to do it so much is because you need to release it and that would be why there is *** everytime you masturbate....<br>  Seriously though buddy, there is nothing wrong with it if thats what you feel like doing..... <br>  stay safe buddy, and just enjoy urself, sex and pleasuring yourself should never be a negative experience or accompanied with negative feelings, you don't need to worry just enjoy yourself you are normal.....hope this helped in some way.....pj|`|pbQm5LTPaa	Their is nothing wrong with the amount of mastrabution you are performing . However if you do it excessiveley their can be a great chance of affecting your posture and muscle levels . Instead of using one hand it is better to use 2 hands to distribute the enormus amount of pressure throughout the process . as long as you dont do this excessively there is relatively nothing bad as it may be good for you in different ways. hope I helped !!|`|81792ff7f01d61fedece489aa368716caa	No, it's not too much! Just dont let it take control of your life! I was lake you when I was your age. Went through times where I could do it three or four times a day, other times when I didnt want to for a week. Its all the hormones. They're at different levels all the time. If your incredibly horny, i wouldn't worry about it! Just enjoy it!|`|lHIMSICbaa	That's not an alarming lot. But maybe you just have an overactive libido (sex drive). Have you tried not masterbating for a day? Sometimes if you don't masterbate for a day or two when you do finally do it it'll feel 10 times better. Plus you don't want to go blind lol.|`|kJGic2kqaa	its normal.<br>  no side effects will develop (you wont go blind :) ) <br>  it may be a problem if you cant stop thinking about it. (if it gets compulsive) if this is the case then see ur doctor<br>  but dont panic its normal|`|qDGfoqW0aa	No if you don't have a girlfriend, your hand can be your friend. Its OK as long as you don't make it blister or bleed, just use lots of lube|`|ShVvz5qKaa	Oh goodness no! That's completely normal!|`|pgKYXG5eaa	wow that's kinda pathetic and YES that is ALOT|`|cVU79EAnaa	Im like you man i do it everyday,somtimes twice...my personal record is 7 times in one day <_<...>_>...<_<......lol.usually once/twice a day though.|`|VroLlbhcaa	totally normal dont worry i do it once or twice daily|`|84fm2GXOaa	as long as your not getting a rash your rubbing off your skin its fine.|`|gfHutvEFaa	you are absolutely NORMAL. Promise.|`|AA10475412	It's totally normal. I started masturbating at age 11, and I still masturbate at age 36.|`|sCCjAKllaa	That's pretty normal for you. Some do it up to 10x a day, or even more. What you're doing is pretty good considering you started so young.|`|DIxbib1paa	Normal dude, dont worry!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	That is normal.
gZ0NPuleaa	Try sand paper.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	uh..... i would just stick to wiping real good and washing it in the shower. if you are worried get some baby wipes and use those too.|`|sshuNKrkaa	use baby wipes, thats what i would do if i was concerned about my A$$hole smelling<br>  <br>  wow.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	Umm, showers are always good... bathing is all i can suggest to you my friend
fifEyApIaa	I just had that done on Monday and it wasn't bad at all!! Do not worry! The worst part is trying to get it to heal!|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Get a root canal if you can.
L6ILAJ3Baa	Yes as Richy said, maybe you should try and get your cousin to come live with you for a while, and give her a fun time! You should really try and revive this girls from the hard life she is going through.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	my cousin recently tried to commit suicide too.  i know how it feels to almost lose someone you're close to.  it's so scary.  i told my cousin he could spend as much time as he liked where i lived, too.<br>  i hope she gets better.  i'm so sorry.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	Im not going to pray because im an Atheist, but  will give you some advice, as i too have been suicidal<br>  <br>  A year on a farm with fresh air and family you can talk to is a great thing. Also, give her sometihng to take care of so to speak. Like a kitten. Just a little but of joy that she can experiance. You needs space. She nees to have some headspace that she can work SOME things out. And a break from her family wouldnt hurt. Just make sure your there for her<br>  <br>  dont be all 'we are here for you and we love you so much' as this will actually make things worse. Do things subtely, keep an eye on her so to speak. And if she want to do something like go outside for a walk, let her, as it takes alot of courage to step back into the world after trying to exit it|`|MhYFGewDaa	Your cousin needs help. Maybe coming to live with your family for a year would really help her. Talk to your mom and dad about your idea, you will probably have to mention the fact that she attempted suicide.<br>  <br>  I'll pray for her. <br>  <br>  You are doing more than my cousin did for me, just by asking about what is best for her and asking us to pray for her|`|0f8aaef56ddfbd7442060251c8e3315faa	u could say "hey how bout you spend the summer with us?"<br>  <br>  then after the summer, be like "how bout another round and this time a year?"
lIU5tUzDaa	Try to cover up the scab.  Try a band aide.  Since its near your scalp try maybe wearing a wrap around headband near the hairline area.  Maybe if you don't see it or cannot get to it as easily maybe you will stop.<br>  <br>  Something else you could try is to use a rubber band.  This might sound weird but wear a rubber band around your wrist.  When you're about to scratch, snap the rubber band.|`|VpmgfCOoaa	you just have to discipline yourself... every time you go to pick the scab, stop and think about the consequences of doing it... discipline is the only way to break a habit but just work at it and I'm sure you'll be able to stop... good luck!!|`|1xlV9l0saa	I pick my thumbs skin on the joint til it bleeds and a doctor once told me that it is a self mutilation behavior and wanted to put me on some strong meds...I declined thinking I could fight it. I am still doing it 3 years later and its so disgusting and I hate that I cant stop.<br>  If going to the doctor is an option I would suggest trying to go that route.
XCn2dK1laa	cuzzzz....if i pick it off,it wont' look at me anymore
os8LiTMMaa	I went through the same thing when I was 14. It's a stage where you are just trying to find yourself and your own personal style. I would go to places like Pac Sun, if you like  a more laid back style. American Eagle if you like a more preppy, cute style. Also, places like Macy's and Belk have just about everything to choose from. (And they are cheaper! lol) Good luck, girl!
yt8KccD9aa	he probably wont remember but maybe he feels that way and the substances loosened his tongue a little lol|`|1IyRmoFzaa	Most likely.  Both impair your judgement.  Hope you didn't do something you'll regret.|`|FM8aCjmuaa	Get away from him now he is a child sex abuser report him now. Tell your parents(you don`t have to tell them about the weed and drink),but it might be a good idea to anyway if this is the kind of people you hang with while you are using.|`|uDjZmSdfaa	OMG!!!!!!!! Run away.
gfHutvEFaa	could be a number of things. depends on alot of different things like if you've had your period, sexually active, etc. My suggestion is to make an appointment with an OB/GYN. They will be able to help answer all of your questions.|`|AZoOruwcaa	go to the doctor! it could be bad!|`|X453cUVFaa	u may have a severe infection c the doc 4 sure.
UzC9gsi0aa	Sharpen a hatchet with a maniacal look on your face, preferably with suitable music in the background (I reccomend the theme from the "Saw" movies). This should be done on a rainy day, especially one where it is thundering outside.<br>  Video tape this, and leave the tape on his doorstep. He'll move out.|`|8viTXKXtaa	call the cops...if he wont stay off yer propety..or if he's egging yer house...<br>  or just stay as far as possible away from himm:)|`|8EUtaXcdaa	Hitman.|`|cJhfSRn6aa	I'd make fun of him until he cries and then hope he doesn't come back.|`|b303ac30b84e46877b74d3a9633e809aaa	Try some of these suggestions from the noted website.<br>  I liked this one.<br>  Tell the annoying person to go away and leave you alone. If, after following the other steps, the annoying person is still bugging you, you will have to get very serious. Your tone should be firm so that he knows you are not joking. Have a witness present when you take this step, in case things get ugly. If the annoying person continues to bother you after this, he is not just annoying you, he is harassing you.|`|mdHfNKcTaa	If you retaliate he'll do the same thing.<br>  <br>  Just tell him te leave you alone and ignore him if he doesn't.
AZoOruwcaa	lubricant is what you can use to make the penis slide into the vagina smoother if it isnt wet enough. there are lots of different kinds...water based is best for with condoms because oil based can make the condom break.<br>  <br>  and youre making a good decision about the promise ring.|`|tCBcAhUGaa	help stuf... get in.... smoother

t2x7Cr6Gaa	ammonia?  Breathing in ammonia? Were you trying to kill yourself? Its a really dangerous chemical. You will have to go to the doctor and tell him about this, and to be honest you should have gone to the hospital after breathing that in a year ago. I am really not  sure how much damage you have done. So go get checked.

Ok9hMG0Naa	when you get to the white pills, those do nothing for you and that's when you should start your period. Sometimes you won't start your period until the last white pill and when you start taking the pink pill, your period won't stop until after the 4th or 5th pill. But you have a normal period, yaz does not only make you have 4 periods a year. Those are the seasonal pills and 4 periods a  year is unhealthy. My acne was a little bad the first month, but after that it got a lot better. Just make sure you also wash your face daily. I'm not sure about the acne medications though...

Anyways i was reading an article about this in 17 and it said that if it feels like mooshy oatmeal like lumpy then that's healthy. If you feel something that feels really hard like a peanut in the oatmeal then it may be breast cancer.

0rpN2419aa	Oh, sorry to hear you are having this pain.  It concerns me because I had a diverticular infection and was in the hospital 11 days with 2 differnet iv's of antibiotics, and one of the regular saline solution going into me.  I had severe pain on my lower left side radiating up to my navel and started running a fever.  I was taken in to emergency because I also have Addison's disease (no adrenal glands) and they admitted me.  Please see your Dr. I don't want you to go through what I did.  If this continues for more than a few more days, I would suggest you see a Dr.  and get on an antibiotic if your Dr. thinks you need it.  I know not having insurance is a tough thing, but it would be better to have a Dr. bill and get on antibiotics than to have to go to the hospital.  I am really sorry, I don't meant to scare you, but I don't want you to get as seriously ill as I was.  Do not take pain pills for this pain.  They will constipate you and cover the existing pain that might me a signal that you need to have care.<br>  <br>  I do care very much that you get this checked out ASAP.  I'm not shouting at you using the capital letters in asap, I am only stressing how serious this could get if you don't get the care you need.<br>  <br>  it could just be constipation, but then it is better to be safe than sorry.  I hope I am not scaring you, I only know how painful it is.  It hurt so bad that I couldn't even sit.  I had to lay down or stand and then the pain was still bad.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry and hope this is not what you have, but I am concerned.<br>  Please take your temperature.  I will not advice taking a laxative unless your Dr. tells you too.  I feel bad telling you this, but they were ready to do a colostomy on me, but thank God, that I didn't rupture after getting to the hospital and on treatment.<br>  <br>  Eat light meals with fruits and vegetables, drink plenty of water and if you feel up to exercise, go walking and see if you can get things moving.  If you start throwing up, you might have a blockage because your foods are not moving through you.  <br>  <br>  Please look up divericulitis online and see if those are the symptoms you are suffering.  I am really concerned about you.|`|EfUFTXxEaa	my suggesting would be getting as much information as you can before taking any action,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a good place for that <br>  purpose.|`|HjispLhMaa	Just try to eat lots of fiber and drink plenty of water.<br>  But once you get health insurance, try contacting a doctor.|`|3wNeHnAuaa	It sounds as if you are a chronic constipation sufferer.  Have you had your colonoscopy?  If you have suffered from constipation all your life you can get whats called diverticulosis.  It is when the stool builds up and pushes so hard on you large intestines that it forces the intestines into little pockets.  These pockets do not resolve, instead little things like nuts and seeds get stuck in them and diverticulitis forms.  Which is inflammation of those pockets.  Sometimes this can resolve on it's own.  However if it doesn't you can get infective colitis.  The pain in your lower left abdomen is a large amount of stool or gas in your descending colon.  You want to drink lots of water, walk as much as possible, and get some prune juice.  If you can help it do not take laxitives, our bodies become dependent on them.  But seek a doctor if you do not have a significant BM in the next 24-48 hours, you can develop an obstruction.
7xc8jgLXaa	not necessarily. Some girls say that they experience breast growth when they take birth control but its most definitely NOT a guarantee|`|EDtcTBRQaa	NO!!!! um.... i dont think so???|`|RjfesRk1aa	It really depends on the person and the type of birth control you are on.

ov7BmlTcaa	It really depends on what you are planning on doing.  I think a trailride in a western saddle would be fine, however anything in an english saddle especially jumping or posting would not be a good idea.  I would be extremely careful mounting and dismounting.  Just pay close attention to how your knee feels while mounted.  Depending on the size of your horse you could be placing some stress through your knees which will not feel the greatest.  <br>  <br>  In terms of the knee brace, it could be very uncomfortable to ride with.  Most people who ride with a brace have a custom brace that does not have medial hinge.  When riding the medial hinges tends to dig into the side of your knee, it can also make it difficult to cue your horse.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Definitely not the best idea I've heard all day.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor. If I had something to bet I'd bet that he'll sigh and put on his dealing-with-stupid-people face before calmly explaining that this is a very bad idea. You want to put on stirrups and get on to and off of a horse? Aren't you in pain?
qph06N5uaa	First multiply your weight by 13  and whatever that amount is,which would be 1820 for you and eat a little more than that everyday and you will gain weight same with weight loss just eat a little less for a while.|`|3ERx4opSaa	well what you need to do is weight lifting, such as bench presses, shoulders presses, crounches, bicep curls, and the seated row. since cardio only burns calories and builds almost no muscle.<br>  <br>  you also must eat protein filled meals, such as those with meat, nuts, beans, lentils, eggs, yogurt etc. like if you want a snack, take a yogurt instead of chips.|`|8uCjC3GYaa	You should definitely not be running on the treadmill if your trying to gain weight. This is because it is a cardio exercise, which burns far too many calories for any wanna-be weight gainer. Although you need to do some cardio, keep it to a healthy minimum, say 20 minutes max per workout.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to gain muscle, look into weight training. I will not list any specific exercises here (there are far too many), but you need to do weighted exercises using dumb bells, barbells, and weight machines. Make sure you are challenging yourself. Find out your one rep maximum for an each exercise you intend on doing; this will allow you to determine what weight you should work out at. A person who is trying to gain pure mass will do 3 sets of 8-10 reps of an exercise at 60-70 % of their one rep maximum.<br>  <br>  Also take your diet into consideration. Eat more calories. If you're going to be working out a lot like you are, you should be taking in at least 3500 calories a day. Make sure they are good calories, such as carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, and gluctose or glutamine. If you find it hard to eat that much, consider drinking protein shakes. (By the way, the general rule for protein intake per day is 1 gram of protein for your body weight). A great source of protein are eggs.<br>  <br>  If you do everything I just told you, you'll be putting on weight in no time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you're a girl, ignore the whole part of taking in 3500 calories a day. My best guess for you would be to take in 2500 + calories a day.|`|hIBNTsy3aa	Well eating more is key...stop running the treadmill and start lifting weights...running will increase your stamina but to get big you need to hits the weights religously..i had your same exact build 6ft 140 and i started eating 3000 calories a day, 150 grams of protien, and creatine along with working out 4 days a week and i gained 20 pounds in a little under a year...If you want it bad enough do it and stick with it|`|w0HgVh6iaa	eat 200 to 300 more calories then your body burns just to survive plus the gym so lets say your daily caloric intake is 2000 just to survive and do basic everyday things..then you work out that adds another 400 calories so now your up to 2400 calories that you burn and need to take into not loose weight now add another 200 to 400 calories on top of that and youll gain weight.|`|AA10855257	I would think the whole treadmill thingy would<br>  defeat the purpose. <br>  <br>  Go to GNC and buy some of their protein shakes.

If its any bigger go to the doctor!!
KOYC3XkJaa	It's to keep them sterile, but I'll also go with your sadist theory because some brands of band-aids have managed to combine the staying sterile thing with easy to open bandages. They open sort of like string cheese: the very top isn't sealed together, so you get something to grip and peel the two pieces of paper apart with minimal effort. Since the unsealed part is after the band-aid itself-- the entire length of the band-aid, sides, etc. are all sealed-- it's still sterile.<br>  So, since it's possible to make easy-to-open band-aids, I'm gonna say the brands that don't have sadistic CEOs.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	It's even worse with rubber gloves on.  It has got to the point where I don't even bother with a dinky band-aid and just use some gauze and 1" tape.|`|yid0jeX4aa	they are not hard, get over it|`|v70p2kgWaa	Because the bandaids are a medical supply, they have to follow medical regulations.  In the case of bandaids they have to be sealed, and to do that, yes it does end up being hard to get open.  That bandaid is going to be in contact with your blood.  Now what would happen if you got sick because the bandaid was contaminated due to it not being properly?  Annoying as it is, it's for your safety.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Let's see. Agree with cole i, who has the right idea, or agree with your sadist thing.<br>  <br>  Let's go with the sadist.<br>  <br>  Do you think anyone who was bleeding from a papercut got another papercut from trying to open a band aid? That sadist probably hopes so. :p
mCEKMWTYaa	It is a really scary feeling and I go through it all the time. It's a long story but I have been through so much pain and suffering in my lifetime that there are times that I completely "shut off" my emotions.  It really sounds like you and I are going through the same thing.  I learned a long time ago how to put on a good "act" or as others may call it "denial".  Even though you may be screaming inside, no one on the outside can see or feel it because you have learned how to hide it so well.  I am sorry I went on so long and I don't know if I even said all of this the right way!  I am really sorry you feel so bad and I do really know how you feel.  One other thing is you try to stay strong for your children too.|`|NrrIDQlIaa	some people get that way because they are depressed and the current depression they are in is a numb one where you just feel numb completely nothing but still kinda also utterlly depressed or it may take more time to feel and to even put a name on the feeling...i would suggest treating your depression if you are depressed as in by seeing a therapist(there are many different types you can choose from), a psychiatrist if you want to try medication, or alternative methods out there...or some people arent just able to cry (formulate tears because of their tear ducts being dry) which their is that eye solution for that...but hope you get help|`|9BbV2xqIaa	it's because you think that society mandates you to look happy. so you have been putting on a nice facade all this time but in reality you're severely depressed. what can you do about it, maybe you need something that'll be the breaking point. something that will galvanize you into crying once, letting it out, and fixing at least the numbness.<br>  <br>  if you go to the doctor they will give you happy pills but that won't fix anything permanently. there's something on the inside that is causing you to feel this horrible and you're the only one who can find out what the problem is.<br>  <br>  it's highly possible that writing in a journal, or writing poetry could help you.|`|mXFiSe2taa	IN THIS DAY AND TIME YOU’RE NOT ALONE ON THAT FEELING.

If you commit suicide you will never see your baby graduate from kindergarten, or dress up for prom, or get married. you'll miss everything in her life. <br>  <br>  How could you be depressed when there is a little girl depending on you for survival and sees you as a god? You're everything to her. Be that person that she looks up to and respects.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you are in my thoughts.|`|chfILbonaa	I am like this have you ever tried not to show your emotions before I used to think it was wrong to show your emotions but deep down inside you could use some help visit a doctor that is what helped me
415675685ba42d09964394dea4a2dc04aa	Mono is actually caused by a VERY common childhood virus called the Epstein Bar Virus, or EBV.  Most people are infected with this as children, and it barely effects them, maybe some sniffles or a little cold.  For some reason if you get it when your in your teens or older it effects you in a different way and is a little more of a pain in the butt, and causes mono.  So just because you haven't had mono, doesn't mean you haven't been infected with the virus that causes it at an earlier point in your life.  The CDC claims that almost 95% of people have had it by the age of 35.<br>  <br>  In some people, not all people mono can cause reinfections because it likes to go dormant in certain cells of your body.  The virus itself is a very strange and not well known about virus, it has been linked with a lot of other illnesses like cancers and lymphomas, but anyways thats more than what you asked.  <br>  <br>  I found this link from the CDC, the people who know the most about these viruses and have good easy to understand info. Instead of me copying the info, check out the link and good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and no, I wouldn't go find someone who has mono and try to get it, it's a pretty nasty cold that can really effect you for more than a week or too.  It also effects people differently.  Some people only have it for a week, while others feel crappy for months.|`|loqsl5xXaa	Mono really isn't that common. There are outbreaks here and there, but you can live your whole life without getting it. NO you don't want to get it just like the pox and get it over with. you can die from the stuff depending on the seriousness of your case. <br>  <br>  ck out the link below|`|ksxlW3HQaa	Excellent answer by "Lindsay" but I would just like to add: that the reinfections occur without any symptoms at all.  During these reactivations, you may become temporarily contagious.  This mostly happens within 2 years of the initial infection.  And, you would never know when you were having a reactivation because there are no symptoms.<br>    <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/ebv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/ebv.h...</a><br>  <br>  To put it simply, you cannot get mono (the disease) again.|`|XoDUTquWaa	I think it is supposed to be easier to get it a second time if you have had it once. I believe it lays dormant in your body and ready to be awaken again. And yes, many, many people never have it.
jFqWYC4uaa	You are right in avoiding aspirin, a blood thinner. Paracetamol<br>  (Acetaminophen) is very effective in controlling pain and fever and is also not a blood thinner. However, consult your doctor who will give you medicines just to avoid the possibility of any other disease that may get in to your system because of a decreased immunity due to flue.<br>  -----get well soon.
ioNKVW9haa	Breast size is usually genetic, so you'll probably end up in the C and D range... however, some women's breasts do not stop growing until they're in their mid-twenties.  Also, pregnancy can have a dramatic effect on breast size.  So that may also be a factor in your mom and your aunts and such.|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	no one can answer this because you'll never know until your fully grown up, but everyone is unique , so you might not even have the same size as your mum.

jBZ6N82vaa	I have tried Goedon. It did work for me. But everuone is different. The only thing you can do is speak with your doctor and try it. I will tell you to keep track of any changes in mood or feelings when you first try it. The best way is to keep a noteboook and write down how you feel. Then you can look back and see any changes. Good luck|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	I tried it.  It didn't do well for me as it made me quite manic.  Once I was able to sleep I couldn't wake up.  Many people do well on it however.

Also at risk are those with a personal or family history of allergic conditions, such as asthma, eczema, or hayfever.<br>  <br>  Individuals who have asthma in addition to food allergies may be at increased risk for having a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction to food.<br>  <br>  A recent study showed that teens with food allergy and asthma appear to be at the highest risk for a reaction, because they are more likely to dine away from home, are less likely to carry medications, and may ignore or not recognize symptoms.<br>  <br>  <br>  How can I determine if I’ve had anaphylaxis?<br>  <br>  Anaphylaxis is highly likely to occur when any ONE of the following happens within minutes to hours after ingestion of the food allergen:<br>  <br>  1. A person has skin symptoms or swollen lips and either :<br>  <br>  Difficulty breathing, or<br>  Reduced blood pressure<br>  2. A person was exposed to a suspected allergen, and two or more of the following occur:<br>  <br>  Skin symptoms or swollen lips<br>  Difficulty breathing<br>  Reduced blood pressure<br>  Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping)<br>  3. A person was exposed to a known allergen, and experiences:<br>  <br>  reduced blood pressure<br>  What are the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction?<br>  <br>  An anaphylactic reaction may begin with a tingling sensation, itching, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Other symptoms can include hives, a sensation of warmth, wheezing or other difficulty breathing, coughing, swelling of the mouth and throat area, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, a drop in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness. These symptoms may begin within several minutes to two hours after exposure to the allergen, but life-threatening reactions may get worse over a period of several hours.<br>  <br>  In some reactions, the symptoms go away, only to return two to three hours later. This is called a “biphasic reaction.” Often these second-phase symptoms occur in the respiratory tract and may be more severe than the first-phase symptoms. Studies suggest that biphasic reactions occur in about 20 percent of anaphylactic reactions.
XK0kZ8Iiaa	anaphylaxis usually occurs much sooner and with it your lips, tongue and mouth will start to swell also.  If you have severe allergies like that-be sure to keep a bee sting kit on hand.  My husband nearly died of the same thing. Part of your symptoms may be because you are worried about whether it is a severe reaction or not.  Calm down and relax.  You can always take some benadryl to help.  If your breathing gets worse, by all means get to the ER quickly!|`|7Y2EkSY8aa	it shouldn't come on 7 hours later. Maybe what you ate was bad in general.

But you are mostly in control of it.<br>  <br>  You may even find out that you can control it with your diet ... that is the ideal way.  First off get rid of the salt shaker.  McCormick and Mrs. Dash make some excellent NO SALT spices.  Learn to cook with spices instead of using salt.  Stay away from prepackaged "fast food" at the grocery store, stop using canned goods .. get fresh or frozen, avoid eating out as much as possible.  The biggest thing ... get in the habit of reading labels it could save your life.  I gave you the name of an invaluable book to get with another question you asked.|`|PCNsRfJPaa	Blood pressure is a dynamic thing.  It changes throughout the day.  Typically, it is lowest in the morning (hence the advice that blood work and BP readings should be done in the morning).<br>  <br>  Caffeine can spike BP, as can certain foods, stress, anger, trauma, etc.  Other things can lower BP in the same fashion.  <br>  <br>  If you're on meds, you should not be able to get your BP up to dangerous levels, unless of a severe trauma.  Finding the right meds is also tricky as your doctor with have to experiment to find the right med for your particular body.  <br>  <br>  If you're currently taking meds, and get a really high reading, you should report that to your doc right away as they need to adjust your meds.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the hypertension club.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	Sometimes certain food may raise your blood pressure. Becoming angry or upset in some way may raise it as well. I have had a blood pressure reading that was so high that a home visiting  nurse was ready to call an ambulance because she told me that I could have a stroke. I had to take a 2nd medication in front of her and after 15 minutes she retook it and it was still high but she let me stay home. I had been upset a couple of hours earlier. I had calmed down or so I thought.|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	For me my usual dose keeps it in control unless I get very upset over something then it will go up but not to what it was when I had a stroke.Then if I need it I can take a second pill to bring it down but only after I told my Dr. about it.She told me to do that,take the second pill.On the whole mine stays pretty normal now.|`|CIWd3vJIaa	I am on 2 blood pressure medications.<br>  Norvasc is one and what  it does is  dilates the blood vessels so that the blood can circulate without pressure.  With this medication I am protected for 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Atenolol is another, and what that does is relax the blood vessels and slow down you heart beat and relaxes you.<br>  <br>  You will feel so much better once your blood pressure is under control. With me it took  6 months to bring it down.  You need to have the right medicine for you, and sometimes you need a combination.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I had to have my medicine changed to a higher level twice and I still get upset at times.
a4kTbjfeaa	ECG or EKG records the electrical activity in the heart and can detect abnormal heart rhythms, enlargement of the heart chambers and some other disorders like pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart), hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in the blood).|`|AA11479078	i think its called an ekg but it measures da amount of activity in your heart|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	As someone who has done extensive research on the electrophysiology of the heart, having taught how to interpret and electrocardiogram, and having written a book (a long time ago) on ECG interpretation I believe that I am in a position to answer your question.  The ECG records only about 10% of the electrical activity of the heart and this limits its value.  If there is an abnormal finding this is almost always evidence of an abnormality affecting the heart.  If the ECG is normal however it tells you very little.  There is a very high incidence of 'false negative' results with the electrocardiogram.  I am personally very disappointed that with the many advances made with computer technology that the technique of obtaining an ECG has not been improved.  Certainly the technology exists to make the ECG much more useful and many medical articles have been written asking why we have not taken advantage of modern technology.  Indeed the technique of recording an ECG has not changed since the 1950s.  Rather sad.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|C2qdLfKdaa	it tells the doctor the electrical activity that occurs in your heart as it beats. the electrical activity follows the rhythm of your heart.<br>  so, its like at a seconds, your atria begin to contract. then at b seconds, your ventricles begin to contract. then at c seconds your atria relax. at d seconds your ventricles relax. and some more stuff.
TqBM7ZSgaa	use hot water on your face to open the pores then get a good facial scrub to clean them out use moisturizer to replenish moisture. then use cold water to close pores back up again|`|I1tnVvVGaa	biore pore strips and befine has a pore refining cleanser....it's expensive but amazing!|`|rmHDABOzaa	Keep your face clean. Wash with a cleanser specifically for oily skin at least once a day. Sometimes over washing can cause more oils to build. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend using a system such as Origins or Arbonne. Both have product lines designed large pores and oily skin (oily skin will lead to blackheads and clogged pores). Both companies have cleansers, toners, moisturizers and clay masks. They are a little more expensive, but they last a long time and I've had incredible success with both companies. My skin was terrible and now it's nearly flawless. Origins is available online, but if you go to a mall, they will give you a free consultation and facial to determine the right products for you. Arbonne is available online or through consultants.<br>  <br>  Whatever products you choose, make sure you don't let your skin become to dry. This will tell your face to make more oils, thereby clogging your pores even more.|`|LqwlAMJsaa	1. Stop wearing makeup (if you're a girl)<br>  2. DO NOT OVER-WASH-- over-washing (more than  2 or at most 3 times a day) causes your skin to up its production of sebacious oil. This is the stuff that clogs your pores, causing acne and blackheads.<br>  3. Acutaine totally cures acne (for good, and it won't come back) (and this includes getting rid of blackheads and shrinking pores). It's really severe on your body though-- it totally tries out your skin and lips, and it has been linked to depression and suicide in teens.<br>  4.MOST IMPORTANT: GET A FACIAL!!! I don't know what your financial limits are, but even if you're strapped for cash, you should consider this. Acne products, even over-the-counter items, tend to be really expensive, so you might as well try something that will work. A lot of women i know (especially fancy/rich women) swear by weekly or bi-monthly facials. I think that this is unnecessary and maybe even bad for your skin, since the aesthetician basically is picking your pimples. When your acne is reduced, you should just let it be and allow puperty and adolescence to run their course.<br>  BUT, in your case, where you have lots of big blackheads, it's important to remove the blackheads so your pores can shrink back down. Plus, they're unsightly and grotesque, so you want to remove them.<br>  <br>  Like many men, my dad has (had) HUGE blackheads on his back. He believed that if you removed them, they would come back worse, because you'd be stretching out the pores. It's the opposite: he finally allowed me to remove his blackheads, and after 2 or 3 tries, his back is almost totally clear. (gross, i know, but it helps).<br>  <br>  So research who you go to. Get a few recommendations-- never go to anyone without a recommendation! And if you do this 1-3 times, you should at least reduce the size and number of your blackheads.<br>  <br>  As for the pores: Pores can APPEAR larger when they're clogged (blackheads) but if your pores are clean and just visible, that probably means that you just have large pores. There's not much that can be done about that (it's just the way your skin is) but cleaning out your skin will make your pores much less visible.<br>  <br>  EDIT: OH and DO NOT buy any products from your doctor. Unless he's selling a real drug, like antibiotics or accutaine, dermatologists usually try to sell you REGULAR CREAMS AND LOTIONS at hugely inflated prices. They get away with it because they put a label on that says "Dr. So and So's Special Creams." In fact, i once bought a fantastic 'DCL ultra-light hydrater' (moisturizing lotion that's so light) from my dermatologist's office (with his name on the label) for $30; i later found THE VERY SAME LOTION (sans his name) online for $3.50 a bottle. Same with all those astringents that they would sell you: alcohol is alcohol; salycillic acid is salycillic acid. That's how they make their money, so don't be ripped off. If you DO go to your doctor, ask him which INGREDIENTS you should look for, and then buy those ingredients in a drug-store brand of cream/wash/astringent.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KTCR5XP8aa	go to your doctor, he'll give you special cream<br>  That's what I did and now i have really smooth skin|`|ldpDzaolaa	blackheads are oxidated whiteheads, meaning exposed to air. use benzoyl peroxide to bleach them and dry them out. avoid triclosan, deodorant and antibacterial soaps as this will dry out your face. try clearasil, the acne products on the market have retinols.glycolic acids which are weak exfoliants, benzoyl peroxide even generic works at walmart, depends what strength you buy, think it comes in 10% or salcylic acid another drying agent. for severe or cystic acne, Rx strength products are worth it like Retin A or antibiotics from a doc, Retin A peels like a sunburn for the first 1-2 wks, just keep using it and have beautiful skin. Dove soap is best for skin cleansing and makeup removal. toners are temporary and can be drying, wash hands, if you clear up the other acne problems, most likely, the pores will appear to shrink up and have overall better skin tone. avoid liquid makeups, brewing ground for bacteria as soon as you open them. wash hands, avoid picking, being a teenager is part of acne, some are luckier than others. I wasn't, but stayed ahead of the game with oral antibiotics, retin, which i still use after 20 yrs. I remember when it was a liquid form. There is topical cleocin and tetracyline or vibramycin, just worth it in the long run. some bcp will clear female acne. good luck|`|rVDBMc9caa	There are some ways for blackhead removal:<br>  <br>      * Use a facial steamer to steam your face for a few minutes. This helps you to open up facial pores, and expose the blackheads. Pat your face dry. Then, use a blackhead remover to remove blackheads. Place the hole of the remover over a blackhead, and gently press down. This will apply the pressure from underneath the blackhead, and pop it up. Then use an alcohol pad to clean it up to avoid infection. Avoid harsh squeezing or scraping at the blackhead. Excessive squeezing can damage the skin surround the pore and can actually increase the size of the pore, leading to more blackheads in the future.<br>  <br>      * You can also use a pore strip. The adhesive action of pore strips can actually rip blackheads out of your face. Since most strips are medicated, this will ensure you don’t get an infection from the rather rough extraction. Use a facial steamer to steam your face first, and pat it dry. Then, just apply the strip to the blemished area, wait the prescribed amount of time instructed by the user manual, and rip the strip off, taking the blackhead with it.|`|iRBb0W5eaa	What you could use is Clean & Clear or Neutrogena to help you shrink the black heads and they will disappear. You can find them at Walmart,Walgreen's,CVS pharmacy, but if you go to Walmart its a lot cheaper. Both helps out really really really well i use both and my face is clear as can be and soft. Hope I helped :)|`|aMvMklMbaa	Get thoose sticky things you put on your face and rip off.<br>  I always wanted to try that, but i do not have blackheads.<br>  You could find them at walmart in the skin care section.|`|WHx3YDfTaa	try using this little device called the "wave" it creams up ur face with soap and deep clens the blackheads and pores

Sack your own nuts!|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The worst pain in the world, it can really knock you sick. The nads are extremely sensitive. The effect of a kick in the nadbag is probably something like being tasered. It incapacitates. And deliberately kicking a male there is seriously NOT funny, and also very dangerous, as just one carefully placed kick can make a man sterile. Now, if that was your son on the receiving end of that kick, you would not be amused.<br>  <br>  What Daisymay refers to "turning inside the sac" is quite true. The injury she refers to is called a testicular torsion. This can occur at any time, in any man, even without a kick. Simply running too fast can cause it! The testicle turns and twists, also twisting the blood supply feeding it. Immediate surgery is then necessary to restore blood supply, or the testicle is a goner. This is the single most common male injury.|`|xgui1LAFaa	may f said it right on. its a horrible stomach ache and u feel like it has to go away immediately or ur genna die.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	worse than giving birth hurts to a woman|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	OMG... i was once accidently kicked in the balls .. at that time.. i could barely breathe.. i lied down in agony, grumbling like a wounded animal.. i thought i was gonna passed out from the pain.. <br>  and miss.. if u r thinking about doin' it.. plz don't ...<br>  have mercy on us..<br>  :)|`|fWclxi9Baa	you cant breathe for like 5 min and you have to sit down|`|XiT8q49Daa	i've never been kicked that hard but it's still hurts when your girlfriend did it!|`|BAlYRNN8aa	The worst pain you could even imagine, and im not just saying that.<br>  <br>  A good kick, sometimes even a hard jimmy tap will send a guy to the floor in pain.

However, if you don't weigh much or drink too much, then seek medical attention if you start having shaking issues, seizure or difficulty breathing.<br>  <br>  Instead of simply relying on H1/histamine blockers, you should also consider using a steroid cream directly on the rash, such as Cortizone 10.|`|XoDUTquWaa	No it will just make you very sleepy and likely to leave you with a hungover tires feeling.
0RGt9r2aaa	yeah i read it in Shape or one of those fitness magizines that doing yoga after a spin class it keeps your muscles lithe and helps you get the most mentally from your workout|`|8SRjELNBaa	Either or, it's your choice.<br>  <br>  Personally i'd do it after because it's stress-relieving.|`|psLk5fDGaa	It could go either way really.. Doing it before would leave you nice and loose for the spin class. Doing it after would be a good stretch and relaxing. If I were you, I'd do it before.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	I'd recommend Yoga before Spin.  Yoga demands strength in some moves which you'd deplete by cycling.  Spin class however you'd still be able to manage with some fatigue. In other words, cycling on a stationary bike doesn't require form so much that fatigue would compromise the exercise, whereas if your muscles were tired, there would most surely be yoga poses which you'd find difficult, or not possible after peddling for an hour!<br>  <br>  Was this too redundant? Hope it helps!|`|aMT2DJnFaa	Oh before definitely. You will be exhausted after your spin/cycling class and physically unable to do anything else.|`|Oe7SOJyDaa	After, because your body is usually tired after spin and yoga will help in relaxing your body as well as stretching it out.|`|OkkppA0Saa	I would say that after because the spinning gets your body warmed up and the yoga tones muscle mass and makes your cardiovascular system become slower than the spinning class. Allowing your body to relax. Yoga also would allow your body to stretch muscles that need to be stretched out after spinning.

Ewdne6qHaa	that sounds like a really healthy day, my only suggestions would be that:<br>  <br>  - instead of the frozen yogurt, you could substitute it with some fat-free vanilla or plain regular yogurt.  if you mix in that fruit you ate and a little touch of honey, its delicious<br>  <br>  - you need other protein besides the tuna!! try having broiled chicken or fish (like flounder or haddock) for a change sometime<br>  <br>  -take a vitamin every day (:<br>  <br>  -have some orange juice/milk with breakfast for calcium and vitamin C<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPEDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oe0aoxxbaa	It sounds as though you did, but I question JUST counting calories if you are looking for health.

g5zSRCGQaa	The discharge is probably a yeast infection.  Are you itching, too? You can get one without ever having sex.  If you have recently taken a round of antibiotics it can upset the balance in your vagina and cause an over growth of yeast.  When you have a bowel movement, you need to wipe from front to back, too, or you can introduce bacteria etc into your vagina and cause problems.<br>  <br>  The breast pain could be normal growing pains, but you should mention it to the doctor when you go to see about the discharge.|`|xijwHZrWaa	No you're probably just going through puberty & your boobs are probably going. Discharge always comes out of your vagina you can't fight that. & I have a small lump in my boob & went to the doctors & they said it was competely normal for that to happen. I don't think you have anything to worry about. But if you're worried then you can make an appoitment with your doctor if you want|`|Ym3BRsrjaa	Maybe your are wearing the wrong bra - wire, too tight.<br>  <br>  About the discharge - white discharge is normal.  If you haven't had sex the only other sign is if the discharge has a foul smell or is lumpy.  Yellow is not very common but I wonder if you are looking at your panties after it has dried.|`|gecvWl5iaa	You might have a yeast infection. Go check with your doctor about that.<br>  As for the pain in your breast, it's most likely just a growing pain.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	could be anything. only your doctor can tell you for sure by running tests. you could possibly have a yeast infection, and the pain could be anything from a pulled muscle to a cracked rib.|`|6fjMtWboaa	Yellow discharge usually mean vaginitis and YES you need to see a dr.  As for your pain, I am not sure about that, maybe trapped gas.  Are you bloated?

When noone takes you seriously . You need to talk to your parents and tell them seriously that you are really thinking about suicide. You need to have them bring you back to the hospital to get evaluated again and you need to have your parents lock up those pills so that you cannot get them. Feel free to email me if you want. Just don't give up hope. I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for 9 weeks in the psych ward and I was angry and furious but those 9 weeks saved my life|`|1o3OqSioaa	Your parents do take you seriously, or they wouldn't have taken you to the psyche wards. They just don't know what to think now that the doctor's are not dealing with your issues. <br>  Parents are at a real loss in this situation, they can't watch you 24/7. They have to work to pay the bills, they have to send you to school, they want the best for you, and don't know how to keep you from having suicidal feelings. Especially, when they've done what they know to do by taking you to the supposed experts.<br>  Sit down with your Mom (or Dad), and tell her/him how you feel without any drama. See if you can talk to a youth counselor and not the psyche ward. Someone who deals with young people your age on a daily basis, will be far more equipped to handle your problems, and feelings.<br>  Most people that have suicidal tendacies really don't want to die permanantly, they just want the pain to end right now. Death is permanant, and a total waste of a young, and precious life. I think everyone feels suicidal at one time or another in their life. Even my own mother told me she had felt that way. She is now 85 yrs old, had 6 children, 6 grandchildren, and now has 4 great grandchildren. If she had killed herself, the world would have been cheated out of 17 amazing lives. Do you understand where I'm going with this? It's not just you that your life affects, you owe it to yourself, your family, and your unborn children to live your life to the fullest. I promise you that things will get better, and you won't regret your decision to live later on down the road. Life is really worth living, especially once you get past these lousy teen years. They stink for most of us, but they are just a few temporary years of what will be a full and happy life, when you are looking back one day with your husband holding you, sitting on the couch and watching your children play around your feet.<br>  Get down on your knees and pray for help from your Lord and Savoir.<br>  May God give you strength and bless you with His unconditional Love.<br>  Lizzie|`|7oetZ4I3aa	i feel where your coming from, if you feel the need to hurt yourself in any way, go to the er it may sound weird but they will have the resources to find the best place for you to go, whether it be home, getting a psychologist, or to put you in a ward they will know what is best for you and be able to protect you from yourself.|`|2AOVcpI1aa	Feel free to talk to me. I'm 13 and going through some hard a** times myself. I've gone through the whole suicide thing. But why would you get so depressed over that?|`|Df3gXIykaa	think about what makes you so depressed, then try to imagine how the situation could be worse, while doing that try to think about what you want from life....house, sports car, husband/wife, children, travel, sports, helping people, there is so much out there to make you happy and everyone was born for a reason,, remember to the world you might be one person, but to ATLEAST one person you might be the world. from 14 on life gets better believe me!|`|PeMpDAbraa	You are making me cry. I am telling you from experience....it will get better. It isn't the end of the world. You have a whole life ahead of you and you are gonna end it over what??? Is it really worth it? NO! It isn't. You may feel like no one listens and no one loves you but you are VERY WRONG! PLEASE SEEK HELP!!! If your parents won't listen...tell someone at school. PLEASE! If you kill yourself then you will never get to find the love of your life, get married, have a beautiful baby, a good job, and all the litlte things in life that make you smile.

ZT7IcihCaa	I never take the placebos in my BC pill packs. I start a new pack of active pills instead. Every 4th month, I stop taking the active pills for a week, get my period, and then start back up again. I have never had trouble with spotting in between periods, and when I do allow my period to come, it's perfectly regular.<br>  <br>  I did a lot of research on skipping periods, and I'll be honest, there are quite a bit of negatives that you're warned about. Talking to my doctor, though, he said that...while there are risks, it's not unsafe.<br>  <br>  My best friend skips placebos and hasn't had a period in 3 years. Maybe a little extreme, but each year her doctor says she's healthy as can be.|`|6x7zV65Xaa	Hmmm the inactive pills are for when your suppose to get your period, by skipping those your doing nothing because you will still get it...the only way to not get your period is instead of skipping those pills, when your last pill is in the pack, then immediately start another pack and keep taking pills each day, but I wouldn't reccommend that...|`|AA12385489	Yes.<br>  I used to skip every other month while I took Aviane during my last two years of taking it.  I did it to avoid the three week long headache I would get every month from the pill.<br>  You don't need a special prescription.  My doctor still wrote a prescription for me for a one year supply and I always went for my annual visit when I was on my eleventh pack.|`|9cTAi7waaa	Dont try skipping your period. Youll end up pregnant. And not taking the placebo pills are fine. Theyre just sugar. Theyre only so your used to taking a pill everyday and it becomes routine. Ive been on BC for 7 years and never take the placebo pills. Take them everyday or they wont work. You mess it up like that, and your bodys out of whack|`|ERaIVdN8aa	Yep...I do it if I have a special occasion or vacation or something...I wouldn't recommend it often as it can mess up your cycle and make it slightly irregular....<br>  <br>  This is the premise of those birth control pills where you only get your period 4x/year.  They just don't have any inactive pills for 3 months...then a week of inactives.<br>  <br>  Skipping your period has an increased risk of breakthrough bleeding (spotting), but with me, I skipped it altogether.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	You can do it but you have to have a different prescription for it.  The regular pill is written for 12 months but if you are only going to have 4 periods a year it needs to be written for 16 months.  Also, talk to you doctor.  Some medical conditions worsen or are not recommended to do this.|`|AA11492002	They have that "under skin" birth control that works for 6 or 9 months without a period... it is the same meds. You should be good.|`|uVMlNvLoaa	I've used it a couple times to delay a period, and then have it a week later than normal.<br>  <br>  You might want to want out, though--you can have light spotting during you skipped period, and sometimes that defeats the purpose of skipping it in the first place. Also, some people experience heavier and more painful periods when they do finally have it.<br>  <br>  BTW, cjohnson's "you'll get pregnant" is incorrect. You -won't- get pregnant unless you have sex on the placebo pills, or if you don't take your pills for more than 2 days.<br>  <br>  Please make sure you're sure before going and giving advice that you know what you're saying.<br>  <br>  Personally, when I messed with mine the first time, I got some very odd clots at the beginning of my period (delayed it 2+ weeks) that scared me a bit. Just make sure you do allow yourself a occasional period.

sPScyaF6aa	Who's drinking?|`|Urkb5O8jaa	I was in a long-term relationship with a severe alcoholic that hid it VERY well, so I might be of some use...<br>  <br>  First is that unless you're asking about your own drinking habits, no matter how well you know the person, you sadly can't assume they are telling the truth. I was my ex's confidant & "best friend" for 4 years before we started dating, then it was another year until he told me he'd been getting drunk in secret, 3-7 nights per week, for 18 years.<br>  <br>  The big thing about alcoholism is that the person usually drinks as a way of dealing with negative emotions like anger, sadness, or anxiety. <br>  <br>  Alcoholics usually don't have "healthy" ways of handling bad feelings... Instead of looking forward to something pleasant in the near future (seeing their significant other, going to the movies, playing a new game, etc.) they have strong urges to blot out the feeling with alcohol. Even once they know the "right" way of handling it, it takes a long time of practicing before the habit becomes ingrained.<br>  <br>  In some cases, the person is 'self-medicating' an actual underlying condition, not just showing a lack of healthy ways of coping with daily life. They might use alcohol to control social anxiety to hang out with friends, for example, or they might use it to temporarily dampen down the pain of depression. <br>  <br>  If you really need to find out, then ask someone that grew up with an alcoholic parent of the same gender for help. For self-preservation, they often develop a finely-honed sense as kids for signs a person is drinking inappropriately... They'd probably know from behavioral descriptions and/or a video of the person drinking while out at restaurant.|`|ukGKDW8Oaa	query the C.A.G.E questionnaire to get a simple way of determining if a person is an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  there are no specific medical tests that can determine that.|`|KBdwiuS7aa	c<br>  Coming from a very experienced alcoholic, I say your friend is definitely an alcoholic. Especially if that person drinks alone often and has been doing so for more than a year.
Jswomud7aa	It sounds like there was decay UNDER the filling which is probably why your tooth has broken over and over. It just means that the filling was leaking and bacteria had gotten under the material. This doesn't necesarily mean that the dentist did a bad job. Nothing will ever be as good as what God gave you in the first place.<br>  <br>  When there is decay present it must be removed entirely and if it's under the filling the whole filling must be removed in order to see how far the decay goes in order to remove it completely. It sounds like that because you didn't have enough tooth structure left for a replacement filling you needed a crown. <br>  <br>  If decay was left under the crown you could have heaps of problems in the future, so it's a good thing that he took the filling out and removed the present decay. If you did not have any symptoms of needing a root canal, and if the decay did not penetrate into the pulp chamber (or nerve) of the tooth than root canal therapy would not be necessary. <br>  <br>  Remember that all the treatment to your tooth is not a guarantee that you will have this tooth for the rest of your life and that's it and it's over with. Fillings need to be replaced on average 10 years, the longevity for a crown is 8-10 years and the effectiveness of root canal therapy is only 80%.<br>  <br>  While I still believe that you should see another dentist to finish the restoration, do anticipate questions as to why you are leaving the previous dentist. Most professionals, dentists included, don't like coming in the middle to finish what somebody else started. So just be prepared.|`|326ba48f98c8c452f0091961ae9cf247aa	Blackness is cavity or teeth decay. Fillings are silver (amalgem) or white (resin).  In my opinion, if u needed a crown then u should have had a root canal.

Ia1ddgSCaa	Mood cycles for borderline can be much faster than for bipolar.  Whilst a bipolar mood, either manic or depressed will usually last at least a few days, normally 2 weeks or more, a person with borderling can have different moods hourly or even faster.  I have bpd but have friends with bipolar.<br>  <br>  Bipolar is a chemical thing, wrong wiring in the brain, cannot be cured but can be medicated, whilst borderline is a personality disorder caused by childhood upbringing and can be treated over time with DBT.  Also can be treated with medication.<br>  <br>  Many people with borderline suffer with PTSD too, due to things like childhood abuse which is a significant causation of borderline in many cases.  <br>  <br>  People with borderline see things very black and white.  Often put others on a pedestal and then can swing very quickly to seeing the person as a very bad person with no middle ground.|`|BaINDEKcaa	Very basic but distinct difference here is:<br>  <br>  Bipolar = chemical<br>  <br>  Borderline = behavioral|`|ETcBRko3aa	The MAJOR difference is that Borderlines have an intense fear of abandonment. Without this, people are not borderline. So, they may flip out when people leave them or they may instead become isolated, for fear of having any social contacts that might leave them. Almost everything a borderline does is to prevent being abandoned; with consciously or unconsciously.<br>  <br>  It is believed that this is due to the fact that Borderlines never went correctly through the developmental stage where they developed object constancy ~ recognizing that someone does not completely disappear when they are out of sight.<br>  So, this happens when children are abandoned by parents, abused, or not taken care of properly.<br>  <br>  The other key differences are that Borderlines tend to dissociate frequently under stress and can display deep seated rage.<br>  <br>  Borderline is a personality disorder that CAN NOT be "healed" with medication. Bipolar is a MOOD disorder that can be "healed" with medication.<br>  <br>  Finally, most borderlines have been severely abused as children. They grew up in an invalidating environment.<br>  Whereas, studies show that an abusive childhood DOES NOT create a bipolar person...Bipolar is a combination of genetics and brain chemicals.|`|yeYL8Udoaa	im borderline which in my opinion is worse than bipolar....<br>  it means that at any second your emotions can change to sadness to anger to happy back to sad...  its awful i cant keep one emotion for more than like half a day :(<br>  &<br>  i constantly think that someone hates more or is talking about me... i hate being alone...

If you want to tone your body, start working out. Guys like girls that are healthy, not toothpicks. I swear.|`|I0rOL46aaa	That's an unhealthy weight for you!  You should be staying at the same weight you are now!  You should probably be consuming about 2,000 calories a day, three hundred calories more on the days you do a lot of exercise.  But before you start doing any sort of weight loss planning, talk to your family doctor.  He or she will be able to tell you whether you need to lose any weight.  Personally, I think that it would be unhealthy to lose any more than 5 lbs at your height, and even that would be pushing it.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  -xo Alice|`|nN8D64Yzaa	over 2000. you're 15, at the perfectly ideal weight for your height, and you're moderately active. there is absolutely no reason for you to be trying to lose 20 pounds--if you do, you will be painfully underweight and your body won't be able to function well. it is much more important to be healthy and get the nutrients you need in a day than to be as small as you possibly can. <br>  <br>  if you really feel like you're too fat at 124 lbs, you need to seek therapy for your distorted body image and weight obsession. now, before it's too late and your mind and body are completely warped by an eating disorder.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Depends on what you eat.

Other tips: Drink lots of water (it really does help if you are looking to loose weight) work out for more than 20 (you need at least 30 if you want to start burning fat) your body goes off carbs the first 1/2 hour of a workout. It's length of the workout and not necessarily speed or difficulty level, however you still want to push yourself so that you still tired.|`|bfQfeUq5aa	around 2,000<br>  thats the average|`|fszP3Ngoaa	Wanna have lesbo sex?
4yFDVPhQaa	i lost weight through ana....|`|6jSxYrZnaa	I wasn't overweight but I decided I wanted to burn off some bodyfat. So I did. I did my research, changed my eating and did some exercise. I lost 10 pounds in five or six weeks, which is all I wanted to lose. <br>  <br>  I ate a low-carb, high protein, moderate fat diet - which is what you have to do if you want to lose weight or be healthy. I chose the Zone Diet as I quite liked the precision of the block method. Most people would not believe how much food I ate. Five smallish to medium-sized meals. This included at least 2lbs of leafy vegetables, at least 1lb of lean meat every, four hard-boiled eggs and at least 50 almonds a day. As well as other food. I was very strict and didn't eat any grains, starches or sugars. <br>  <br>  I also did high-intensity interval training twice a week.

XTqpWDXPaa	If you are anemic I wouldn't smoke marijuana.  One of the things anemia can lead to is hypoxia or lack of oxygen to your organs, and replacing the oxygen with smoke isn't a good idea. Also, in more severe cases, the body will attempt to compensate for the anemia by raising your heart rate, which can lead to serious heart problems.  One of the effects of marijuana is an increased heart rate which will only exacerbate the heart problems. <br>  This is my general understanding of the subject, but remember that few people on here are actually medical doctors.<br>  If you really want to smoke marijuana, I would talk to your doctor first.  Doctors are safe to talk to because of doctor patient confidentiality and you can't get in trouble for asking about it.|`|kFHwzBG7aa	The same thing that happens if you smoke dope and you're not anemic - you get high.

It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects.

It is a 100% natural method. <br>  Try <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a> but do not forget to talk to your parents about it first!! Ok?<br>  <br>  The KEY of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  Not only did that program cure me - you can become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution!

The only thing the doctors can do really is give you Xanax which you are too young for, I refuse to take them, they are VERY addictive and once you start you'll be on them forever, if you try to stop taking them you go through terrible withdrawls, trust me I've had one family member and one friend go through this. since xanax is so addicting people usually abuse them and it typically makes you really mean, I just decided to deal with mine own my own, and its hard not having medication for it, but its better than being addicted to drugs. Please see your doctor and don't worry!!! I wish you luck!

If that is the case, yes. I do. Most people do. Our bodies are not symmetrical, including our eyes. I have about a one diopter difference between my eyes, and have always had this. It is not norm, not the exception.|`|HlXrHd52aa	"worser"? "then"?<br>  <br>  the vision in my left eye is a little worse than my right eye.

Iyvt7ibmaa	Basically, sleep walking is a condition when your body is and some brain function are still awake, but you're unconscious enough that your brain doesn't know how to control your functions, if that makes any sense. So, parts of your brain are awake, and your body is awake enough to perform tasks, but you're still technically asleep enough that you don't really know what's going on or that you're doing it whatsoever. This can be caused by a number of things, but it's usually caused when you fall asleep too fast, without prior relaxation and giving your body and brain a chance to calm down and doze off. It's completely normal and common in children. You're more than likely grow out of it as you get older. One way to stop it is if you go to bed a little earlier, lay there and give your body and brain a chance to relax and fall asleep on your own. <br>  Try it. If it doesn't work, try going to a doctor or a therapist. There could be an underlying psychological reason for why you're not getting the sleep you need. :)
9dtrWO5laa	you have to actually eat to lose weight! your just going to starve yourself and when you go to eat normal again you'll gain all your weight back and then some.<br>  <br>  and a person who is 5'2" should weigh anywhere between 102-136|`|IGCZq7BXaa	normal weight for 14 year old girl i think is like 120 at least|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Okay, first off, unless you're overweight, you will be starving yourself, and your body will begin eating itself for energy, which IS NOT A GOOD THING.<br>  <br>  Second, if you're a HEALTHY weight, then you should TONE your body through working out. Abs have got to be the sexiest thing on a woman.<br>  <br>  Third, if you want to change your LIFESTYLE, it needs to be permanent, or you're going to **** up your metabolism, which will rubber band back on you when you "go off" your diet.|`|AA11091145	No.  You need a bigger breakfast.  Add oatmeal with that grapefruit.  <br>  <br>  The chicken nuggets are a big no.  Instead have a grilled chicken dinner for supper.  A better lunch would be tuna packed in water with no mayo.  Mustard is okay.  Or you could have a lean chicken breast sandwhich with no mayo.<br>  <br>  The salad is also a no unless you use fat-free dressing.  Even low-fat dressing has more fat than a big mac.  Eat a good proper dinner at home.  You need food for energy to do that palates :)<br>  <br>  Do not diet at 14.  Eat whatever your mom makes, but lay off the sauces like mayo and salad dressing.  You need calcium and iron when you are 14.  Cut out the coke and sweetened drinks and you could eat pratically anything at home.  Eating out is what makes a person fat.|`|F8Yj3U9caa	that is a great plan              i think the average weight is like 120 or something|`|flYO5vg2aa	your crazy|`|xijwHZrWaa	Well it'll make you lose weight but I think you'll be really hungry all the time & never satisfied. The best way is to eat a big breakfast, that should be the biggest meal of your day, but let it be health. Like a bowl of oatmeal & fruits. You should ALWAYS eat a lot of fruit for breakfast but you could also eat cereal, a small bagel.. something healthy but fulfilling not just one grapefruit. If you eat a big breakfast you'll eat pretty well throughout the day. & for lunch you should probably eat a bigger lunch, maybe eat healthy chips with the nuggets? & you don't want to eat just three meals & light healthy snacks in between & for dinner a salad is a good choice & dinner should always be your smallest meal & make sure you don't eat 3 hours before you go to sleep. & excersising 30 minutes a day will help you lose weight too but make sure you do cardio workouts too. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped (:|`|mBnmH8bUaa	jeez at 14??? honey, you're growing. Give your body some fuel for christ's sake. a healthy breakfast should be milk and cereal... lunch is a sandwich with a salad and dinner is what your mom gives you. Don't worry about your body at 14!!! Be 14 and just hang out with your friends. Worry about that stuff later when you're 18 or so.|`|yYBMYMwZaa	I think you need to eat healthy snack in between so that way you'll consume the right amount of calories and have energy<br>  You can eat apples and other fruits in between the 3 meals<br>   For a 14 year old there's no "normal weight" as long as you look and feel healthy|`|3b5c1b2374e54df48a8dc857796172edaa	That is not nearly enough food! You need to eat at least 1200-1700 calories a day. Go to www.fitday.com - they haev a free calorie tracker and some tools to help you plan your diet.<br>  <br>  If you eat too few calories, you will trick your body into thinking it is starving to death and it will reserve fat, which will make it harder to lose weight... you're better off eating more!|`|yhjoTuHzaa	A diet like that may kill you. Your body is starved for calories. No one should ever drop below 1200 calories a day. That comes from the experts the nutritionists.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	far too little. and with exercise?

But it will be extremely unhealthy for you<br>  to do this plan for many reasons. <br>  <br>  -One is you should have a variety of foods and eat different things, not just the same thing every day.<br>  <br>  - Two you should eat 5-6 small meals a day to keep your metabolism up, which will automatically increase weight loss. <br>  <br>  -And lastly with your workout plan, you should do a variety of exercises because after a while your body will build up a tolerance and you will stop losing weight and toning.<br>  <br>  <br>  And you should be between 104 and 136.|`|cZAhjolnaa	Eat some more for breakfast and dinner!! <br>  eat sweat potato- that's good for diet since you can defecate well.<br>  Excercise more than you eat<br>  <br>  You should eat meals on time or you will gain more weight<br>  If you feel hungry, YOU SHOULD EAT OR YOU WILL GET MORE WEIGHT << that's really true and you should believe me<br>  <br>  the normal weight for a 14 year old at your height is around<br>  100 pound|`|B00vcfVEaa	No, try:<br>  Eating Tortilla chips at the end of dinner and then drinking water.<br>  <br>  Eat small lunches and few snacks in between meals.(note that some healthy foods make you gain weight).<br>  <br>  Also, worrying about your weight may increase your weight.<br>  <br>  I'm not good at remembering Weight but the average weight of the girls at my school is about 110-120|`|sUzfhXpXaa	your crazy, this plan will make you die.<br>  not enough nutrients, its a fact that if you eat a bigger breakfast full of carbs you will have more energy throughout the day, and therefor you can exercise more. dont change the way you eat, except maybe cut out some junk food.|`|OQhDSYMAaa	No, it won't help you lose weight. That's starving your body, and it's rediculous. As soon as you begin eating normal again you'll gain weight because your body thinks it's still starving. Don't eat less than 1,050 calories a day, 5'2" is about 110-140lbs. Just eat healthy, don't be dumb.|`|5ZXAVeZVaa	I weigh 110 and I'm 14. <br>  But theirs plenty of people my age who weigh less than me. <br>  Probably the most "HEALTHY" weight is 120.<br>  <br>  How much do you weigh?<br>  <br>  eating less will probably make you more hungry which means in time you will probably binge on food. making you gain all the weight you lost!<br>  <br>  You should exercise and eat 3 healthy meals a day. <br>  <br>  that's probably the most healthy way to lose weight effectively.|`|wKLZobsDaa	it sounds like a stavation diet 2 me! but if ur 14 u shouldn't b diet'n like tht! when your 14 you still a lot of growing to do and certain diets like this one will not give your body the daily amount of nutrients that ur body needs, n your body will break down bekuz ur not gett'n proper nutrients. result'n n u be'n hospitalized! u have 2 watch these thingz! if u want 2 lose weight try consult'n wit ur mom! and if she agree'z then she will take u 2 a dr.!|`|KtW7TvSjaa	im also 14 and only weigh 110 lbs,,,trust me your probably fine just the way you are, the way your eating now your going to starve yourself, Being skinny isnt fun, you cant go out in bikinis cause all you see is  bones and poeple always make fun of you, just be happy wiht yourself, TRUST ME|`|t21se9dZaa	Honestly, your 14 years old, you dont need to lose weight.

Ewdne6qHaa	you don't just "become" a cheerleader. most cheerleaders have taken gymnastics most of their lives, or are just peppy and really flexible. of course if you trained by yourself wicked WICKED hard like every day i suppose you could do it. anyway, cheerleading isn't really that fun. take it from me!!! trust meee...
UUNgj9aAaa	either you don't work out as often, or you work out to the point of pain, or you work out to the point of pain and then don't work out until the pain goes away and start working out again...you need to start gradually and always warm up first...if muscles hurt then don't stop working out, you gotta work through the pain, believe it or not the pain will go away faster..i know from experience|`|f09110e96fc7fea8709e780b2d0068feaa	Are you doing large weights and high reps in your work out?|`|3ERx4opSaa	well, if your are just starting to lift weights, your muscles might not be used to such deployment and simply become sore.<br>  <br>  However if it is a strenous pain, as if one that does hurt when not using the muscle, you are working to hard.|`|pUWUf5Xfaa	They probably hurt because you didn't stretch before you exercized.  If you don't stretch, you're more likely to pull something or overwork your muscles.  When you start exercising before stretching, your muscles are still too tight; exercizing will hurt them because they aren't flexible enough to do what you are making them do.  As for a painkiller, ibuprofen works well, or try taking a hot shower/bath to relax your muscles.|`|G8W1nSmZaa	when you work out, your muscles actually rip. they get stronger by repairing themselves after being ripped. try drinking tons of water...or acai juice. <br>  if you're trying to gain muscle, try eating a lot of carbs/protein after your workout.|`|LqaM39Mbaa	im no expert, but you might be working out your muscles a little too much|`|EhEdOojOaa	It's because you've not been using your muscles for quite awhile.

For many couples it can be something interesting and enjoyable, but it should be something you feel comfortable with. If you feel uncomfortable about other people seeing it or people judging you because you did it then don't do it. If it is something you are interested in then go for it. Don't be afraid to say no if you are uncomfortable with it. <br>  <br>  Also, don't do it if you are a celebrity unless you want to leak it and get publicity.|`|T959zDizaa	i absolutely would not do that. even if you and your guy are comfortable with the situation and you feel like you can trust him not to put it on the internet and stuff, still don't. you never know what hands the tape would get into and you could have your reputation trashed for the rest of your life. but if you still want to do it, just be really careful. Good Luck and Have Fun :)|`|kVLyt5wSaa	only if you are comfortable with it. my bf and i have also been together for 2 and a half years and we have alot of tapes of us doing it. lol. but it's kinda fun when you get used to it and get comfortable. oh yea and if you trust him not to show anyone then go for it!|`|sMCXvQ5gaa	I would do it if it was to myself and a dude ^_^ not on the internet cuz if ppl watch that stuff then.... problabley when they see you the next day they will be like oh hey I really like you -------- lol so I would keep it to myself and if we brake up I would keep it just in case he thought crazy enough to put it on the internet :P|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Don't put anything on tape or video that you wouldn't want your boss or parents to see.

Good luck!|`|tC2T7poCaa	hell yeah, there r alot of things u should do with your partner that are of the radar and filming yourself is one, plus it's one of those thigs you could say "i did that" too when you are older lol|`|LVRBtXGuaa	i would say no, he could show the take the tape and show people and put it on youtube, i dont think thats a thing you want the world to see|`|xijwHZrWaa	Well if you trust him enough.

SCeIOtZpaa	Well you said "he said he thinks he's been depressed the last week" so clearly he is feeling depressed. But maybe he is embarrassed that you brought it up (people and their pride can be kind of odd and hard to understand).  <br>  <br>  When it comes to depression it's usually hard to convince someone of the things you have noticed, because it's one of those things they need to figure out and want to fix - not be told how they are acting/feeling.|`|9pLI73pqaa	I'm no mental health professional, but he definitely needs help and so do you since you can't reach him. Get third-party help quickly for the sake of your husband, yourself and your marriage. Something is definitely wrong!
XbKmgaKIaa	NO, BOTH of you will have mono if one of you is infected. Mono is a serious disease which can cause the spleen and liver to swell up and maybe even cause death. The best way to solve your  problem is to just not kiss your girlfriend until you know the real deal. Get lots of rest, stay out of physical contact with anybody, but relax and you will be fine.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	no mono is a virus even if you don't feel he effects you will always have it. take care and get lots of rest
XJ6RxMQIaa	Well, at least your thin! But you should learn to eat healthy now, because eventually your metabolism will slow, and you'll not know how to eat properly. I would suggest limiting energy drink intake, and cutting back of your salt intake a little (Noodles, chili, hotdogs, chips, and sausages contain alot of it). And eat more fresh things too :) So I would rate you a 2 :)|`|xWD4XG7Naa	seems like this is ur goal in life, to be unhealthy. hey, to each his/her own tho.|`|3ERx4opSaa	1<br>  <br>  no fruits, vegtables and only drinking an energy drink?<br>  <br>  seriously stop with the freakin energy drinks their full of caffine and have been known carcinogens.|`|FpwyxVbwaa	no fruits or veggies- bad!<br>  i'm sure you would have been fine if you had eaten maybe 1 chili hot dog and maybe 1 and 1/2 sausages instead of 2 chili hot dogs with chips and 3 sausages.<br>  you should definatly try to drink more water and try to cut out the soda as much as you can.daily recommended amount of water is usually like 8 cups but even 3 or 4 is more than enough to stay healthy and fully hydrated
upvLAyyzaa	Shrooms are evil....I did that once when I was a teenager and I will NEVER do them again.  Awful experience.

3meIiIsmaa	If she has been sick - it is most likely a swollen lymph node - but if it is red and feverish - it may mean that there is more infection in her system than the node can handle.  I think she needs to see a dr. for antibiotics to clear everything up and get well again.<br>  I don't suspect cancer or anything life threatening - but something that does need to be seen.|`|pjbz1tCraa	Sounds like it probably just a swollen lymph node. If she has been sick, then the lymph node is just filtering out all of the infection and everything. It may even stay swollen a while after she gets better. Sounds like nothing to worry about. Very normal.|`|ukGKDW8Oaa	if you think about your anatomy, it's probably a swollen lymph node that reacted to her ear infection.  it could also be the tail end of the parotid gland.<br>  <br>  do not delay seeing your doctor.  she may already need antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications.|`|KKdUWNY3aa	I get these lumps in my ears all the time.

1TD0nRaRaa	When you hiccup, your diaphragm involuntarily contracts. (The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen. It plays an extremely important role in breathing.)<br>  <br>  This contraction of the diaphragm then causes an immediate and brief closure of the vocal cords, which produces the characteristic sound of a hiccup. What actually causes the hiccup is difficult to say - in most instances, there is no obvious cause.<br>  <br>  Attacks of the hiccups seem to be associated with a few different things: eating or drinking too fast; being nervous or excited; or having irritation in the stomach and/or throat.<br>  <br>  In some extremely rare cases, the underlying cause of hiccups can be pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane lining of the lungs and chest cavity), pneumonia, certain disorders of the stomach or esophagus, pancreatitis, alcoholism, or hepatitis. Any one of these conditions can cause irritation of the diaphragm or of the phrenic nerves that supply the diaphragm - it's the irritation that causes the hiccups
EsvJ9ji3aa	no but  you can get "Sexually" transmitted diseases by doing other things such a oral sex or the genitals touching without sex.

Sexual intercourse isn't only one way to contract disease's.  All of the diseases that you can contract through intercourse you can contract through oral sex.

ES7QVGbZaa	if youre talking about penis size...<br>  then no. <br>  because sometimes a girl's vagina is really tight (don't buy that crap that if a girl has lots of sex, it gets loose. its not true at all! you're either born with a loose or tight vagina..NOTHING can change it...even after giving birth, the vagina goes back to its original size).<br>  anyways...sometimes if a penis is REALLY big around, then it could hurt and cause her to bleed. and if its really long, then he might not be able to get all the way inside of her and it could hurt her. <br>  im a virgin, but my friends always say this:<br>  7 is heaven<br>  8 is great<br>  9 is pain<br>  <br>  & a girl cant even tell a guys size until she already has him in bed, and if she is the type of girl to walk away from a guy because hes too small, then that girl isnt for you.|`|62090c45c2dff067ee36d896ab2d47d4aa	No, bigger isn't always better. Alot of guys lose their confidence when they think it's not big enough. But your as big as you feel, because in the end all that matters is your own satisfaction. Besides there is such thing as being to big and vice versa.|`|oEoYmcjNaa	I agree with cloe.  bigger is not always better.  there are other factors.  the guy has to have the right fit for the girl, and it also makes a difference how he uses it: premature ejaculators for instance are no fun.|`|xuCY36yWaa	LIKE THEY SAY IT IS  HOW YOU USE IT.

But it depends on the size of the woman, and the girth/length ratio. Girth is usually more satisfying for most women. And honestly, it's how you use it! Go for the angles! Move around in there, don't just do "in/out" like so many inexperienced guys do. It's not as satisfying. So I guess my long answer is no, bigger is not always better if a guy doesn't use it well. Size does make a difference, but it's definitely not the only factor.|`|I5PdelDoaa	brennan  - ur answer is sick, rotten bastard. <br>  <br>  size dosnt usually matter - in some few cases it does. certain positions are a lot nicer with a bigger penis and vice versa for smaller penises. girls have lots of crap to worry about (stupit celulite!!) I really think the whole penis size thing was invented by us women to give guys a taste of their own medicine!! all of my female friends agree.... it actually really is how u use it!!|`|D8mn8X85aa	No, size is never important.

ej6OdnDBaa	that is horrible. dont you EVER eat less than 1000-1200 calories a day. you will lose a ton of energy and i think you might even gain weight in the long run because it will take a major toll on your body. <br>  The body can work harder if you are well nourished. if you are starving yourself you will become weaker. As far as the 3 pounds go  just do plenty of excescise but maintain yourself fed.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Too hard to calculate how much weight you'd lose with all the variables, but let me give you some suggestions. Lets start with your intake. 600-700 calories is borderline starving. Add the 600 calories worth of exercise, and you'll be feeling pretty run down in a week I promise. Now there is a way around this TEMPORARILY.  Supplements. Protein, and some performance enhancement (like a Nitric Oxide or caffiene type energy booster). That will get you through your week. But you'll find that such low intake will most often lead to binge eating at some point and you'll make little to no progress in the long term. A better plan is to allow for more calories, say 1000 - 1500 and spread them across 5 meals (still with supplements.)  This will increase your average metabolic rate, stimulating your body to lose more weight. As far as your diet, if you lower fat, you will lower calories. Fat calories amount for 1/2 of the calories in most foods you'll find. Not all calories are the enemy, fat calories are always the enemy. Especially when it comes to a life long pursuit of healthy eating. Last thing, to burn the weight the fastest, you want to mix resistance with intensity. In other words, weights and cardio.  how do you do that? Well Alot of what you did as a kid (plyometrics/ calisthenics) are very effective. Add some light weight and you've got a serious fat burning routine. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nrVrP8mZaa	okay, it's not a good idea to eat 600 calories and then work 600 off. I wouldnt reccomend it. you need some food in your system to stay alive. i am currently on a diet right now and its really easy. my mission is to lose 50 lbs and I have already lost 8 pounds this week.<br>  <br>  All I am doing is cutting out all carbs from my diet for 2 weeks, then after that you switch to only whole wheat carbs. In the mean time I am working out burning about 300-350 calories a day just doing about a half hour in the gym (20 mins on the bike, and 10 on the treadmill) You need to really push yourself within the half hour but it really pays off.<br>  <br>  There are still plenty of things you can eat the first two weeks that arent carbs. Salad, chicken, eggs, cheese, diet pop, vegtables, etc. Also, carbs are what make you hungry, so not eating them, really makes me never hungy. Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  This diet works great and I have figured out I am going to be at my goal weight, lost 50 lbs by June 1st. Good luck.|`|2CFZrPhVaa	Calories is a major subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn three definitions: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a certain activity expends each hour, and finally our own personal daily limit of calories. The sole diet which definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce success!

It's also not great to consume unnatural stuff but they aren't doing any real damage. The other thing is that they're quite expensive. <br>  <br>  As to the "why", he's obviously got masculinity issues. It's not something he's going to get over in a hurry.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Sounds like your jealous because he is giving his body more attention that he is you... am i right?
dZxjXHA2aa	When I sprained my wrist, my doctor warned me that I would now be more prone to sprains and that that wrist would never be as strong as before.  This is probably what happened with your ankle.  Due to the earlier injury you may now have tendonitis or a touch of arthritis around those joints by the ankle.
rJgrwIodaa	If you eat healthy enough, you should burn some fat and tone your muscles.  If you eat a bunch of junk food, you'll just be replacing the calories you burned with more junk calories.  Think of it as regular fuel vs. high octane fuel.  Your car will run on both, but it will run much better and longer on the high octane stuff.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Oh my, if you eat your fruits, vegetables, nuts & whole grains your going to see AMAZING results.

Sometimes it can be a little gooey. You usually don't just bleed and bleed, but if you do you should see a doctor. Flows can vary throughout the day and week. Your period is when the lining of the uterus sheds itself. If you were to conceive a baby this lining would pad the fertilized egg, but you get your period when the egg isn't fertilized... so it's more than just blood.|`|UtULHIohaa	When you get your period it can start off quite light, usually starting off with a brown discharge.

You might be lucky and has quite light pain free periods :-)|`|rlWZtKx2aa	it drips when the flow is heavy.  if it's light it's not like a paper cut either...you will definitely know when you have your period.

AA10450505	YAZ is VERY controvertial!!! It is meant to treat PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) i don't believe it's even considered a first-line defense against pregnancy - but, primarily, an SSRI (selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor - or antidepressant) It certainly does NOT prevent sexually transmitted diseases, and in terms of regulating flow / clots / duration of flow - ASK YOU HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. Recently, the CDC made the manufacturers of YAZ retract statements they'd made, on their commercials. A very effective and narural way to assauge "PMS" symptoms, is to use Black Cohash, which is an herbal dietary supplement, to alleviate PMS,Q10coenzyme and evening primrose oil capsules are also useful. I'm, personally VERY wary of YAZ. Check out the Cebters for Disease Control website, WebMD and the National Institutes of Health websites. Take good care.|`|ERaIVdN8aa	I gained weight....I also transitioned from highschool to college to the "real world" during this time however, so that had a lot to do with it.  I think it really depends on what type of pill you are one....I gained about 10 lbs. over 3 years with the first type and then 15 lbs. in less than 3 months with the latest brand - I'm actually going to attempt another form of BC...I have an appt. tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I had a drastic decrease in sex drive.<br>  <br>  It's a process of weighing the good with the bad....if you continue a normal work out schedule and eat well (both of which I didn't do a good job with) weight gain should be minimal.

Make sure your flow is not light when you try to do it for the first time.<br>  <br>  Read the instructions that come with the tampons rather than someone trying to explain it to you.

A younger girl is more likely to be careless and leave it in for hours on end, than an older women is.|`|rtrdOcTcaa	A 13-year-old can use tampons, but it might not be very comfortable.  If a virgin (and I hope you are one, at 13) pushes the tampon up too far, it could break her hymen, which could be very painful.  And you're likely to be pretty tight, so even the slim tampon going in could hurt.  There are many people your age who use tampons successfully, but it's usually better and easier to wait a couple of years.|`|XMDN8N27aa	If a 13 year old just started her period, she should get used to it with pads first but tampons are totally ok.|`|YWMfvgyJaa	you can use tampons|`|16bWGB14aa	Who said they couldn't I was 12 when I started using them.|`|5f614e2e96b3fb9e9678be9ef96d8967aa	theres no reason you cant! tampon away! :)|`|9irbd8esaa	they can. i do?|`|8qmAe25jaa	Who said they cant?|`|UtULHIohaa	They can use tampons although it is not advised at such an early age as they can cause the hymen to break and this can be painful. <br>  When you are at this young age you are not fully developed and tampons can feel uncomfortable, also it is a responsibility as you need to remember to change them regularly as they can cause Toxic Shock Syndrome. That is why it is advised to wait until you are 15 to try tampons. At 15 your body is more developed and tampons may feel more comfortable.|`|X3HzsRD4aa	Who told you that? The only time a girl cannot use tampons if for about a year after they start their period. After about a year since you started your period, you can use tampons.|`|NJv91GTGaa	umm;who told you that. your allowed to use them. i just wouldnt use them if you just started getting your period. then use pads untilll youve had it a couple timees.

rcPnnfmmaa	The good news is you're the only person I've seen all week on Y!A Health who does not need to go find a doctor.<br>  <br>  Your hand fell asleep. If you sleep in an awkward position (or even sit in an awkward position) for too long you can cut off circulation to a hand or a foot. When that part of your body first starts losing oxygen you don't feel it but when you shift so oxygen-rich blood can flow in again the nerves wake up in a very bad mood and fire at random. This is why you feel a burning tingling sensation. It goes away because the nerves recover after a while.<br>  <br>  It is possible do slow down blood flow for long enough to do damage. I've never heard of someone doing real harm while sleeping. Usually people shift around a little or turn over as they sleep and are unlikely to spend the entire night sleeping on your hand. What does hurt people (especially those with poor circulation to begin with) is very long plane flights (say, England to Hawaii direct) with inadequate leg room. Stretch or at least get up and go to the bathroom once in a while or you risk a blood clot.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	You may have a subluxation in your spine which is pinching a nerve and causing numbness.  You may also be developing carpal tunnel syndrome.  Try pressing the backs of your hands together with your fingers pointing toward your chest.

If you gain weight or have children your bust will change. I was a 32 A for many years having my first child in my 30's changed all of that. At age 50 I was a 34 C.

a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Good specialists in thyroid disease don't really exist. You have to be your own doctor. Do your own research. Then you fire doctor after doctor after doctor when they don't do the right thing and they don't help you.<br>  <br>  I can tell  that you already ned a new doctor, because yours didn't even tell you what your daughter has. There is no such thing as "having thyroid." Well, I guess maybe technically there is. Because everyone has a thyroid. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that produces hormones that control the operation of your entire body. Your daughter has a thyroid disease. But there are a dozen different thyroid diseases. The very first step into doing your research is to figure out what your daughter has. The direction of treatment is different depending on which thyroid disease she has.

You need a specialist for that. I work for an Oral Surgeon and we fix the mistakes that dentist make all the time. They can break the tooth off and they don't have the tools A Surgeon has to get the root out. We pull out all the teeth in one shot sometimes. We sedate  the person, it is all over in one shot and you don't have to pay for the anesthesia 2x. It is better to get An IV sedation. The salt water rinses as hot as he can stand should make it feel better. about 5 or 6 times a day

hHSsMyNpaa	About 30 years ago I had perfectly straight teeth but slowly over the years my slight overbite was causing my lower fronts to hit up against the backs of my top front and have over time been pushing them out just a little and caused a slight gap to appear, and the two next to my fronts to rotate slightly.  I don't think at my age though I am going to bother with it.  Its not that bad.  You could have a lifetime of perfect teeth ahead of you though if you take care of the little details now.  Is it all worth it ?  Hard to say.  But its not like you got put in braces for no reason at all.  Make them explain it all to you again.  It will be  too tough if you are going to start to resent it and be sorry about what you are doing just 2 weeks in.  The best thing you can do is make your treatment go as quickly as possible.

AA10450505	ALWAYS take antibiotics for the FULL course prescribed. ALWAYS. Phone the pharmacy where you filled the metrogel and ask to speak to a registered PHARMACIST, not just a technician. Likely, the advice will be "too late, now. Jope for the best, but if it returns, you'll have to repeat a whole cycle." NOW, here's WHY you use ALL the medication prescribed: symptoms go away BEFORE the root cause of the problem does - thank God, right?!- so, you feel better and figure "It's resolved! YAY!" you stop using the med and the actual infection regains it's strength, has time to FIGHT the medication, may even mutate and become stronger . more difficult to cure, thus, NEXT time you need treatment, you're gonna need an even stronger med. Now, multiply that by how many times you're likely to contract some form of infection, for the rest of your life, and you can see why diseases are rampant, infections become plagues - our global health is out of control!!!!! Scientists labor, daily, to invent a strong enough medication to fight the next affliction to come down the pike. So, please, take your meds, as prescribed. Be well.|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Well, you may have just helped to create a resistant strain of the bacteria.  When you're prescribed something, especially an antibiotic, you MUST take all of it as prescribed.

oi6eHkPzaa	Hello. You are evidently very worried about this, and i don't think you should be. Faith is one of life's great intangibles. Personally, i don't really believe but i would like to be able to. I suppose what i'm saying is that if you have faith and truly believe then that's enough, or it should be. I truly hope you find what you need.|`|6fjMtWboaa	Ok first and for most you need to give this to God.  I believe that us humans are like coal, polish it and then you have a diamond.  You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you.  Now to address your anxiety, you are in need of christian counceling for this.  Someone you trust, perhaps Genesis couceling at your church.  What concerns me as a medical professional is that you need psychiatric help but must be willing to seek it and leave your home.  You need to break those chains that bind you and I know that you can do it.  You are strong you just have to believe in yourself and believe that God can heal you.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	Ask Jehovah, in his ever-lasting mercy, to take this burden from you and carry it for you--just don't try to yank it back by dwelling on it again.|`|AA11788494	You could have OCD.  I don't know.  Maybe you should see a counselor.|`|4bZou8qQaa	John Fischer has some great books that I encourage you to read. Below is an excerpt from his book Fearless Faith:<br>  <br>  A fearless faith.<br>  We all need to think through why we are here and what our faith is for. By its very nature, faith is dangerous. It puts us at risk in a world at odds with the One we follow and stretches us constantly by the demands it puts on us. And yet there is a glory and an excitement to the risks of faith. We often wonder what motivates those who attempt dangerous feats--competitors in the extreme sports or the Evel Knievels of today. Maybe it’s because there is something built into all of us that embraces risk. We can meet danger with either fear or excitement. When fear rules, it’s because deep down we don’t believe we have what it takes to face the danger. Excitement comes from knowing and believing that we do.<br>  <br>  <br>  A fearless faith, then, is one that takes full advantage of the prayer of Jesus. A fearless faith is a faith that is not driven by comfort, safety, and security. It is a faith not necessarily shared by our companions, a faith that takes mental discernment to maintain, a faith that is vulnerable and unprotected--even weak--without the prayer of Jesus to strengthen it and give it courage. A fearless faith does not need a cultural identity to thrive, for it thrives and flourishes in the heart of the believer.<br>  <br>  Real faith is always at risk; the risk is part of what makes it real.<br>  <br>  Or as Jesus said in his prayer: “As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.” The world was not a safe place for Jesus. Why would we think it would be any different for us?|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	That voice you are hearing is not God's voice. When God speaks to people, the message is always first, "don't be afraid." <br>  <br>  Whether the voice is the voice of the world, or the voice of your own frail flesh (we are all frail, I am not personally insulting you) or directly the voice of the devil, it doesn't matter. It is not of God, and you need not heed it. I know that can be hard. <br>  <br>  Remember this; God and Satan are not evenly matched. As the priest in church put it a few weeks ago, it's not like God v. Satan is a prize fight, where both are at the top of their game. God is infinitely more powerful. Satan is merely a disgruntled employee; someone who gossips around the water cooler and tries to make trouble. And trouble he does make often, but when you know how little, how weak he is (and yes, let me also emphasize that we are even more frail) and believe in the power and strength of God and let it work for us. One way that evil works is to try to convince us constantly that we are falling short, that we are supposed to feel so much pressure to do so much more, to do things that are impossible. Evil pressures us toward perfectionism, which only leads to depression. Self-pity is destructive and keeps us from healing.  So much of our task, so much of what we have to do, is simply to allow God to work in our lives. He will never let us down. So much of the battle is just to acknowledge and receive God's grace. Satan blocks us a lot in the receiving department. And God's grace is deserved by none yet bestowed upon all, especially upon those who seek Him.<br>  <br>  Get it out of your head that you are a victim; ask God to help you with all of these things. You are not a victim, you are a victor in Jesus Christ. It is never easy to accept salvation when we are filled with shame, so give your shame to Jesus, it is why he died for us. He can take it, he is one with the Father and has all of the strength of the Father. He didn't die for any of us because we are worthy; rather his act of sacrifice made us worthy. <br>  <br>  Jesus exudes healing. In the gospels, people are healed just by touching his garment. And people are healed through the faith of their friends, consider the man who couldn't walk, whose friends lowered him through the ceiling on a mat, to be healed by Jesus. Jesus said that was healed through the faith of his friends; imagine that, not even by his own faith. And even if we have little faith, it is in that faith that we must rely, and it will not let us down. There is doubt in all of us, don't dwell in the doubt, dwell in the faith.<br>  <br>  And maybe, like me, you whine a lot about your life, whine about the things that God wants you to do. Do them just the same, whining or no whining (not whining might make you feel better.) Ask God for guidance; he won't let you go to the next step until you've completed the one you are on. <br>  <br>  And no, you can't find Christian fellowship without leaving home. You can talk to people on the internet, but real fellowship requires building relationships with people, finding a good church that will lead you in the right direction. Not a church that will shame you, not a church that tells you you're just super the way you are either, but a church that will help you move in the right direction. And God loves you whether or not you love yourself, God loves you whether or not you are doing what he wants you to do (but it is because of his love that he wants even more for you.) <br>  <br>  This lenten season, try to give God the things that are keeping you from a closer relationship. Give God the self-reliance, which will fail, because of our nature as frail beings. Give God the pride, give God the sadness, give God the depression. Let go of these tares in your heart, stop feeding them. <br>  <br>  Is God telling you to witness to people all the time? You are hardly a witness if you are depressed all the time. Your life says more about you; God's people are known by their "fruit". What kind of "fruit" does depression yield? Something bitter for sure. God does ask things of us and has asked us all to spread his word, maybe you are starting at the wrong point. Not that looking foolish for Jesus Christ's cause is a bad thing; maybe just not such a fruitful thing for you or for others. <br>  <br>  Pray that God build a bridge from your mind, which comprehends these things, to your heart (your deepest will), which needs to accept these things. Be patient, wait upon the Lord. I pray that the peace that passes understanding be with you.|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I have depression and anixety and I am also a Christian woman.  I have been trying to serve God for years.<br>  <br>  I have dealt with depression and anxiety as far back as I remember.  I got prayed for many times, hoping for a healing.  It did not happen.<br>  <br>  I finally decided that I needed to get help.  I got to the point where I did not want to serve God anymore!<br>  <br>  I went to a Christian psychiatrist and he helped me with medication.  I am now having a little bit of therapy to help me with self-esteem issues.  I AM so THANKFUL  that I decided to get help.  My depression is gone.  I am happy.|`|4kkkBRTaaa	What are you guilty for? Please be sincere to yourself and God. Genuinely ask for forgiveness and repent of any sin and God will forgive you, cleanse your guilt with the blood of Jesus. If you have done this faithfully through prayer, then you will definitely be ok. God is near, just act in faith and in all honesty.<br>  <br>  Fear? Why should you be afraid if your trust is in the living God. Christianity is not about religion, it is real experience with God through Jesus Christ. Haven't you read Psalm 127? - it isn't for a joke, <br>   1 The LORD is my light and my salvation—<br>         whom shall I fear?<br>         The LORD is the stronghold of my life—<br>         of whom shall I be afraid?<br>  <br>   2 When evil men advance against me<br>         to devour my flesh, [a]<br>         when my enemies and my foes attack me,<br>         they will stumble and fall.<br>  <br>   3 Though an army besiege me,<br>         my heart will not fear;<br>         though war break out against me,<br>         even then will I be confident.<br>  <br>   4 One thing I ask of the LORD,<br>         this is what I seek:<br>         that I may dwell in the house of the LORD<br>         all the days of my life,<br>         to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD<br>         and to seek him in his temple.<br>  <br>   5 For in the day of trouble<br>         he will keep me safe in his dwelling;<br>         he will hide me in the shelter of his tabernacle<br>         and set me high upon a rock.<br>  <br>   6 Then my head will be exalted<br>         above the enemies who surround me;<br>         at his tabernacle will I sacrifice with shouts of joy;<br>         I will sing and make music to the LORD. <br>  <br>  Why are you creating your own hell? Christ died for you so that you do not go to hell. Develop much love for God by reading and meditating His word to know more of Him. Always ask the holy spirit to guide you through, seek God's face in prayer, do this more often on a daily basis. You will soon realise how much God loves you. His benefits are countless. Divine provision, protection, liberty, deliverance, upliftment, honour, glory, good health, infact, you don't need to see a psychiatrist as someone suggested because God is enough for you. How I wish you followed all this. Your joy will be full even to overflowing because Jesus bubbles, I mean just wonderful.<br>  <br>  If the devil is telling you that you are not doing enough just bind his mouth in the name of Jesus. Your "all the time" priority is to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, leave other things to Holy Spirit who directs you.<br>  <br>  If you read bible and pray quite well and you do not seem to function mentally quite alright, then check yourself. Are you leading God or allowing God to lead you? Are you open to Holy Spirit to guide you? Please do not practice religion, experince relationship with Jesus through the word of God and definitely you will win win win.<br>  <br>  Why don't you want to leave your home to attend christian fellowship? Please email me if you can I would like to counsel you further on this.<br>  <br>  Sister, take courage, the victory that overcomes the world lives inside of you.<br>  <br>  Please pray each of this prayer points below very well until your soul is satisfied: (Do not just read the prayer but pray it dilligently and sincerely).<br>  <br>  1. Holy spirit, deepen in my heart the knowledge of heaven in the name of Jesus<br>  <br>  2. O God, come as fire and purify my heart in the name of Jesus<br>  <br>  3. Holy Spirit, come by fire, come by force, fight my battle for me in the name of Jesus<br>  <br>  4. Holy spirit fire, ignite me to the glory of God in Jesus' name<br>  <br>  5. O God arise and let my story change in the name of Jesus<br>  <br>  6.Satanic agenda for my life, vanish in the name of Jesus
735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I don't know about fibroid clear, but there are supposed to be herbs or extracts which help get rid of fibroids.  Have you seen a doctor who knows how to give you bio-identical hormones for this problem?  Here are some articles to read about fibroids.

Women who have HIV and are pregnant can  be given medication that can reduce risk of transmission to the baby.

00792da82dde73ce69a0bb30ddb3220baa	Whether you can get SSI depends on your income and resources (the things you own). The two main things Social Security looks at are:<br>  <br>  Your Income:<br>  Income is money you receive such as wages, Social Security benefits and pensions. Income also includes such things as food and shelter. The amount of income you can receive each month and still get SSI depends partly on where you live. You can call the social security office to find out the income limits in your state. Social Security does not count all of your income when deciding whether you qualify for SSI.<br>  <br>  The first $20 a month of most income you receive; <br>  The first $65 a month you earn from working and half the amount over $65; <br>  Food stamps; <br>  Shelter you get from private nonprofit organizations; and <br>  Most home energy assistance<br>  <br>  If you are married, they also include part of your spouse's income and resources when deciding whether you qualify for SSI. If you are younger than age 18, part of your parents' income and resources are included. And, if you are a sponsored noncitizen, your sponsor's income and resources may be included.<br>  <br>  Social Security will not count any wages a blind person uses for work expenses. For example, if a blind person uses wages to pay for transportation to and from work, wages used to pay the transportation cost will not count against you. If you are disabled or blind, some of the income you use (or save) for training or to buy things you need to work may not count.<br>  <br>  The second main thing Social Security looks at is your resources (things you own):<br>  Resources that are counted in deciding whether you qualify for SSI include real estate, bank accounts, cash, stocksand bonds. You may be able to get SSI if you have no more than $2,000 in resources. A couple may be able to get SSI if they have no more than $3,000 in assets. Social Security does not count everything you own in deciding whether you have too many resources to qualify for SSI. For example, they do not count:<br>  <br>  1.The home you live in and the land it is on; <br>  2.Life insurance policies with a face value of $1,500 or less; <br>  3.Your car (usually); <br>  4.Burial plots for you and members of your immediate family; and <br>  5.Up to $1,500 in burial funds for you and up to $1,500 in burial funds for your spouse.<br>  <br>  Other rules you must meet:<br>  To get SSI, you must live in the U.S. or the Northern Mariana Islands and be a U.S. citizen or national. In some cases, noncitizen residents can qualify for SSI. For more information, ask for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) For Noncitizens (Publication No. 05-11051).<br>  <br>  If you are eligible for Social Security or other benefits, you should apply for them. You can get SSI and other benefits if you are eligible for both. If you live in certain types of institutions, you may get SSI. If you live in a city or county rest home, halfway house or other public institution, you usually cannot get SSI. There are some exceptions to this rule.<br>  <br>  If you live in a publicly operated community residence that serves no more than 16 people, live in a public institution mainly to attend approved educational or job training to help you get a job or if you live in a public emergency shelter for the homeless, you may get SSI. If you live in a public or private institution and Medicaid is paying more than half the cost of your care, you may get a small SSI benefit.<br>  <br>  The Biggest Loophole in the Social Security SSI Program:<br>  The loophole is simple enough to understand but complex to put into action correctly. SSI rules state that a person cannot be worth above $2000 if they are not married, and $3000 if they are married. In order to determine if a person, or married couple, is worth above the limit, Social Security looks at their resources and what they own. They look at real estate, bank accounts, cash, stocks and bonds that the person or couple owns. <br>  <br>  Specific criteria must be met to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance Income (SSDI). The Congress of the United States has defined disability, for purposes of entitlement to disabled worker's benefits as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.<br>  <br>  A person must not only be unable to do his or her previous work but cannot engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, considering the persons:<br>  <br>  <br>  age <br>  education <br>  work experience<br>  <br>  It is immaterial whether such work exists in the immediate area, or whether a specific job vacancy exists, or whether the worker would be hired if he or she applied for work.<br>  <br>  "The worker's impairment or impairment's must be the primary reason for his or her inability to engage in substantial gainful activity, although age, education, and work experience are also taken into consideration in deter|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well trying to applay for siior ssdi. you will not  get it the first time, trust me when i say that.

SSI is for medicaid/low income usually less than 12k/annual, SSDI is when you have been off work for 6 mo or short term disability. the soc sec .gov site explains info how to apply and what you need to qualify in addition to disabilities covered. you will always get denied on the first application. just go with the admin hearing instead. they back pay from time of application and you need an attorney that you won't have to pay , have to find one that either they recommend or someone who will take the case, they make you wait forever, up to a year before your case is heard or even longer, if you go back to work even 1 day before being off for 6 mo, you have to start all over again. it's a long wait.... some wait up to 2 yrs. the gov't bets you'll give up or die before they have to pay you and if you get disability, it will be less than at an older age if you were to wait, just like getting it early before age 65, etc. you need lots of doc notes to document this condition and proof of time sheets and time off from work. good luck.

JOimXli5aa	Wow, was going to ask almost the same question myself...<br>  <br>       I have quite a few doubts about ADD(which I was diagnosed with at a young age ) or ADHD should be considered a 'disorder' however, I'm not going to bother going into that topic since that's not what you asked.<br>  <br>       Anyway, I myself find it hard to present an answer as I have similar questions, however, I'll do my best.  I would like to mention that the suggestions I have apply to people in general and not just those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.<br>  <br>       It might sound silly, but first and foremost, I have found that simply eating a good breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks (for those parts of the day when you need some extra energy), keeps me energized and happy.  Also, getting a proper amount of sleep is extremely important so you don't feel exhausted all the time.  Getting outside and doing physical activities whether it be running, karate, or walking downtown with your friends.  Which brings me to keeping your social needs met.<br>  <br>       I know for a fact that after a weekend where I sit all alone at my house, I feel like crap and hate the world.  However, after a night driving around the city visiting restaurants, Record Stores, and the mall with friends, I feel good about myself and satisfied.  You may or may not be a family person, although I find it hard to enjoy family time since when I was younger I did hardly anything with my friends and went around with my family quite often.  If you do not know a great deal of people, get out there and look for shows, concerts, exhibits that match your interests and meet new folks!<br>  <br>       Basically, the answer isn't very hard to find.  If you're not finding what you're up to in life at the moment interesting, then do as you mentioned; adjust your lifestyle.  If you're cooped up inside (I for one have been guilty of this on many an occasion including the current moment), call up a friend, and get out and do something with them!  <br>  <br>       Heck, maybe even see if one of your friends would be interested in bringing a little more 'spice' into their life as well.  Try out new hobbies, who knows?  Maybe there's something out there that will strike your fancy that you never considered before, or it did and never got around to it.<br>  <br>       It's much better to make an attempt and try new things than sitting there wishing you had the energy to do them.<br>  <br>       Now, with that moving speech said and done, I'm going to try and live up to my own advice to avoid being a hypocrite, hahaha!<br>  <br>       Good luck mate, and hope I helped in some way!  If not, hopefully you find the answer you're looking for!|`|aVfOxfEDaa	omg, i seriously thought i was the only one who is constantly BORED. i know it sounds bad, but i smoke a lot of weed. even then i still am always bored, i paint a lot and read and watch movies. hope that helped|`|a5gXxwMLaa	I have both ADD and ADHD combined type.

GvQHw4Ntaa	Yeah, I think you're okay. It usually isn't a big deal to miss just one pill, and you did the right thing by taking two pills the next day. According to most prescription information that comes with birth control pills, you only need a backup method of birth control if you miss two or three pills. I wouldn't worry about it, but definitely make sure it doesn't happen again.
Dg0D8SCZaa	you need to go to your doctor. have them do a blood test (some women don't have the hcg hormone present in their urine, or not enough of it to be detected, until later in pregnancy) and an ultrasound if they see fit. if you're not pregnant, there could be a medical problem that's suppressing your period.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	I do not see how blood tests and urine tests missed your sisters pregnancy there is no real way, ha.

See: "For Most People, College is a Waste of Time" Enter this in the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a>  Richard Branson left school at 16; Winston Churchill was not a well-performed student, and Bill Gates didn't finish college.<br>  <br>  Your future may well be in another field, such as: graphic artist, real estate, cinematography, Feng Shui consultant, auctioneer, landscaping, fashion design, aromatherapist, jeweller, music industry, photographer, personal trainer/aerobics instructor, beautician, etc. School is about teaching some basics, and keeping students occupied, so adults can work, that's all! Try many things (except drugs, binge drinking, and the more dangerous ones) and develop those areas in which you perform well, or have natural talents. <br>  <br>  Consider having aptitude tests, vocational guidance, and career counselling, to give you some ideas on what may suit you best. Ultimately, it is much more important that you be a good person, who helps others when reasonable to do so, and makes a fair contribution to the society which supports him/her, than academic performance. <br>  <br>   See section 26, on getting organised, at ezy build. Build in around an hour daily "me time". The study breaks, shown in section 13, can contribute to reducing that to as little as 30 mns, but that should be your absolute limit, and have more free time on weekends. Make a study schedule, and show yours to your teachers, complaining that you have too much to do, already. <br>  <br>  You could either join, or start study, and homework groups with A FEW friends, sharing the workload, TO SOME EXTENT , ONLY. If you all present virtually the same answers, you will be found out, but if you rewrite it, using your own words, do a fair amount yourself, and restrict the tendency to try to get too much of a free ride; you may find this helps. It won't, though, when it comes to examinations, which is why you need to do as much as reasonably possible, yourself. Ensure other members do similarly, or they will surely "blow it".|`|cH1ztMjPaa	Stop feeling like a complete failure because you're not.  You're a totally overloaded human being.  ANYBODY would be feeling like you do right now.  That's the truth.  You have too much to do.  Any human being right now would be having a breakdown.<br>     It doesn't make sense that your goals for the future costs you a decent life now.  That only makes sense if you're fighting for basic needs, like food and shelter.  You're doing this for an Ivy League school.   I think you know it's not worth it.  Do you want to trade a life worth living now for the status of an Ivy League school later?  That means you don't count, but impressing other people does.  Hmm.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	dannng!<br>  <br>  I have like 2.5 GPA haha<br>  take it down a notch.

Think about it, if you can push yourself through this dark time, most obstacles will seem meager in comparison.  Don't crumble under the pressure, fight back and use it as a motivation to do even better despite the hardship.  I would normally say that you shouldn't be so worried about grades seeing as colleges hardly look at sophomore year, but just seeing what you've typed I know that I cannot change your direction.  Meditation will really help with the stress, but don't lose hope and keep fighting.|`|BiiLd4O6aa	You don't need to overburden yourself with homework. Take a break every hour or two. Relax for a few minutes. When you are all stressed and tired, you are less efficient. Take a few minutes to stretch and relax. You'll feel a lot better and you'll have more room to breathe and think.<br>  <br>  Ivy league colleges look at multiple things, not just your GPA and scores. They look for extracurricular activities, clubs, and other activities. Set a reasonable standard for yourself. If you don't feel like you can achieve a 4.0, aim for something lower, like 3.7 or 3.8. Whatever it is, don't feel like its the end of the world.<br>  <br>  Also, there are plenty of top schools in the country. Ivy leagues are up there, but there are plenty of alternatives. Not every company wants to hire an ivy league student when they graduate. You'll probably have better luck, but there are other options out there.<br>  <br>  Again, take a deep breath, relax, and start again. If you need help with your homework, try getting help from friends, a tutor, or asking your teacher for help. Also, the web is a great resource.<br>  <br>  No reason to get all stressed out.|`|TaHIpVBLaa	tell your teachers about your homework situation. Show them your school record and that you've always maintained good grades before. Tell them how the rest of your life is suffering from the overload. It is good to have such great goals, but remember that colleges are also looking for balanced people who are interesting, not just drones. Use your communication skills and ask if there is some way you can prove to each teacher that you can perform just as well in class and in testing without all the homework. Strike up a deal if you can and then stick to it and prove that you are a great student irregardless of homework.|`|f8rYpHTJaa	how do u know an ivy league school wont be harder than this is for you now???<br>  maybe u should get ur priorities straight i know this sounds bad but my teachers told me that when i complained about homework, maybe do the homework you know u need to do to learn, maybe your homeworks taking so long because its not your learning style <br>  i really dont know but good luck<br>  <br>  buck up little camper as quoted from one of my all time favorite movies [=
ddCU9KTWaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IUI. Went through the IUI injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IUI and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianmedguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianmedguru.com</a><br>  You can get much information in this website.
RFUgLmxyaa	Simple: if she says to stop, stop. If she says she wants to keep going, keep going.|`|rSwce38saa	I think that this answer is self-explanatory. If anyone is in pain, would you continue to provoke it?<br>  <br>  I mean, if she says "keep going" thats a different story. But I doubt a virgin would say, "keep going."|`|GrCj35muaa	first of all, you have to make sure she is wet, it helps with the pain, also, if it is really hurting her you should stop even if she says not to, it will hurt less the next time you have sex.|`|oYGtkVwOaa	it hurts when ur cherry is popped. unless she really is in pain dont stop.  it will stop hurting her the more u do it.  <br>  lol have fun|`|oncDS4FKaa	Well its easy as pie lol  If she says STOP then you STOP and so forth :)|`|TYxbaE4paa	uhhh noo. She's in pain..give it some time.|`|hSaEhRwJaa	NO and don't do that to her if you love her. Beleive me i'm not an old arcaeic nun or something, but I think sex is for married couples. After all what is the root of it? Procreation. Any non-romantic and loving sexual feeling you have are harmones, animalistic harmones. Loose your virginity to your wife and her's to you then she will feel pain, but be proud of it.|`|g5zSRCGQaa	Your obvious guess is good.  The first time is usually a bit uncomfortable for the girl but it shouldn't be painful.  If she is in obvious pain then she has not lubricated enough or you are pushing in too far or too hard.|`|FEGDvZ77aa	You should continue because they are always gonna feel pain when your dick goes in there vagaina, it may not hurt as much as it used to if you were to have sex regularely with her, but they are always gonna feel pain when having sex.|`|X453cUVFaa	unless she tells u to stop i dont see y u would need to it doesnt hurt that bad.|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Wow!  I'm impressed.  I don'tt think most guys think about this.  Whoever you end up with will be one very lucky girl.<br>  <br>  Sex doesn't have to hurt the first time.  If it does, her body isn't ready for sex.  This may be she's just not matured enough physically, or she isn't "turned on" enough yet.  If you start having sex, and she looks uncomfortable, you should switch tactics and not enter her yet... try going back to kissing, and touching.  Try using your finger inside her many, many different make-out sessions before you even attempt sex.  If you cant talk to each other comfortably about anything, especially about sex,don'tt do it yet.<br>  <br>  A piece of advise if you want.  Both my fiance and I had sex with different people before we started dating, and we both agree that we wished we had waited for each other.  It's totally different with someone you're ACTUALLY in love with.  We both feel that in our relationship together, we had sex too soon.  Once you have sex, you can never, ever take it back.  Its a decision you should puta lott of thought and love into making. Don'tt rush into it, no matter how you feel at the time, you WILL feel differently in the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sMCXvQ5gaa	Well first of all when a girl is gonna do it with a guy they should be ready with at first masterbating dude Im 11 and I sometimes masterbate it feels good :) Lol anyways its pretty retarted if you see porn videos and the lesbians(Im not) make noises like uhh uhh when the other lesbian sticks a sex toy in their vagina....so yeah it doesnt hurt if you practiced before lol, so if your a dude and your about to have sex with a girl you maybe should ask her have you practiced yet or started masterbating and if she says no...well bring out the skinny sex toys\furniture lol so then stick it in there but first start with your fingers if its dry spit on it and rub it until she fells great and start putting your finger inside of her lol, in and out and shes like :) lol after that start putting the sex toys in her and fast then bam bring out your king penis and your having sex with her and she enjoys it and if she makes loud noises like so hard well then your doing a good job but it hurts her so maybe you should start by her sucking your penis :) and then rub your penis on the vagina up and down and ask her "so...are you enjoying this so far" she might say " OH YES" oh "yeah :)" Lol so then you work down to her vagina slowly after tell her your gonna go rough on her vagina or butt whole the end!!!

I highly doubt a doctor will give you medication and tell you that it's ok to drink. If you let your doctor know that you occasionally have a drink, he or she might be able to prescribe something that you can skip taking for a day. A lot of anxiety and depression medications are the types that the doses need to be lowered over time to get it out of your system, rather than just abruptly stopping the usage.<br>  <br>  If this is something that you really want to get under control, you will give up the couple days a month that you go out drinking.

Just be easier on her next time.|`|1KqknaUHaa	she might have started her period early or if she's on birth control and forgot to take it a few times it can cause your period to start, so it could be either of those.<br>  <br>  You could also have just made her bleed and the cut or whatever keeps getting reopened with sitting maybe?<br>  <br>  She should go to the doctor as it could be more serious.<br>  <br>  I doubt it was your fault.|`|gI887vfyaa	hey..sorry im a girl...but sounds like to me she could have some kind of infection (not really saying you gave it to her ya know) but she needs to be mad at herself and not you so just tell her (calmly) that she should just go to a doctor because yall had some "rough sex" and there might be some damage goin on or somethin that she needs help wit....sorry im no xpert.|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	well either she was a virgin but unlikely or she was pregnant  she really should go have that checked out but it was HER fault|`|qOTTt7mhaa	Tell her to go to the doctor....?|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Not ur fault.|`|grRGlNWhaa	.. sorry if this is too much information. but the same thing happened to me. he's not like.. ridicously big- but hes pretty big. and i started bleeding. i also told him to keep going- this happened like.. last sunday. and i'm still bleeding. i'm not supposed to get my period until tomorrow. so i was a whole like.. week early- which doesnt happen when your on the pill. i'm not sure what it is.. maybe shes just early, maybe you ripped into something, i'm not sure.  you didn't do anything wrong, don't blame yourself. this is so ironic
KSUPtqCaaa	The immune system of a newly-born or neonatal child is immature. Typically, newborns rely on their mothers milk for antibodies to help fight disease; but this of course relies on the child receiving such feedings in the first place.<br>  <br>  That said, I would recommend you speak to the neonatologist before taking him home. It may be worthwhile for him to spend a few days longer while you recuperate. This will help minimize any risk of transferring the virus to him. Once he does come home, you will be less able to get adequate rest yourself, which could worsen your condition.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your son and best wishes!<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Newborns don't have much of an immune system at all.<br>  <br>  If you do feel a little sick, ask the doctors for a mask (i'm sure they will give you one) and wash your hands before you hold him.<br>  <br>  You should also boost your immune system.|`|gyixPyOsaa	no. talk to the dr if he is in the hospital still its because his immune system is weak. it depends on the baby but defiantly tell the dr what your symptoms are and ask if your baby can deal with colds yet. they won't send him home if he can't handle a little cold.
iCqfmRC3aa	Oh, hell yes.  Yummy!<br>  <br>  It is my very favorite pastime.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry that you are uptight about it.  If you do it for him, he will feel very disappointed in not being able to please you in return.<br>  <br>  Try this, go take a long bath, primp and pamper yourself before bed, so you feel very clean and pretty, then do him for a little while, then let him do you for a little while ... by taking turns you might be able to relax and get more into it and I promise you'll have his attention for as long as you want. Or you could do each other at the same time :)  I really like that!<br>  <br>  Also remember its not a race and climax is not the only reward, sometimes when you take away trying so hard it makes it better and easier.  So don't set artificial goals, giving him pleasure and allowing him to give you pleasure is often enough. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RSBufJHUaa	First time I was 15, she was 14. She LOVED it.  After we parted, her sister told me my ex used to tell her every time I went down on her.  Her sis and I got together and I was the first to go down on HER.  She said no wonder her sis loved it.  I could pleasure a lady orally all day and all night! I LOVE doing it!  So, youngest I've done was 14, oldest was...58 (my lady)...and several ages in between.  I never had a lover who didn't come while I was down there pleasuring her.  Course, I had a good teacher from the time I was 15 until I was 19 (43 year old widowed friend of the family).|`|Df3gXIykaa	i honestly do, i would actually prefer giving as opposed to receiving, something about it and maybe the females reaction is what gets me goin..........|`|nzf258hEaa	I have enjoyed oral sex with my woman but she is not very comfy with it when I give it to her, she enjoys giving it to me.|`|XAkLPdhqaa	I love to give women oral.

But i know people who have it and im the exact same way as them. You get hyper at random times, and you cant sit still or concentrate on anything. You can go to this site <a href="http://cdc.gov/NCBDDD/adhd/symptom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cdc.gov/NCBDDD/adhd/symptom.htm</a> and it will help you to know better if you have it. Sometimes ADHD isn't noticable when you're younger, i know someone who didnt find out until they were 20. So go to the site and if you think you have it, go to your doctor and he will refer you to a specialist. Also, you do get depressed often.|`|TaHIpVBLaa	Sounds like  a type of Bipolar. There are several types, and they usually show up at this age till about 30 years old. You may have the one where you are mainly having manic episodes and then after a long period of time you get a few days of depression. The mania will make you hyper and give you feelings like you are invincible, and make you want to do things you wouldn't normally do that might be reckless, or irresponsible. Research Bi-polar and see if it might fit what you are feeling.

nv5Mewe3aa	1.) What are some questions they might ask me?<br>  a.) What are your goals?<br>  b.) What do you do to exercise currently?<br>  c.) Do you have any physical limitations or health problems?<br>  d.) What is your diet like?<br>  <br>  2.) How many sessions should I buy?  -  You need to work out for 30 days to give any routine a chance whether you are doing your own, or being trained by someone else. Just once or twice a week (it will take your own added efforts of course.)<br>  <br>  3.) Is it worth it?  - Absolutely. Many lack the knowledge and motivation it takes to make a difference. Not in a belittling sense.  But as with any pursuit, a specialist is going to be able to provide you with much more in depth direction and attention.  A trainer will push you, manage your goals and log your progress. The trainer will add a myriad of different exercises to your routine, and specifically tailor them to the result you want.  You'll also get advice on your diet as well, again, tailored to your goals.<br>  <br>  4.) Do you know any specific companies or any personal training facilities? - Most gyms have personal trainers on staff or in house independants. Finding one won't be hard. What you should do is find a gym nearby, and within budget. Then take the time to interview a couple of trainers. 1/2 of training is the chemistry between the trainer and the trainee. Look for someone who is geared toward the kind of training you are looking for. Muscle/ Mass building and weight training are pretty specific. So look for those types of trainers.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3ERx4opSaa	1. they will ask you why you want to get fit, and what you eat as well as taking some measurements.<br>  <br>  2. as many as they reccommend you need<br>  <br>  3. yes, it very useful to have somone push you.<br>  <br>  4. no, it is better to get a personal trainer in private practice because in a corporation it is much more expensive.|`|OzK10hKxaa	The questions they will ask you will be what you are aiming to achieve, the experience you have of the gym already and probably the diet that you are on.<br>  <br>  Only buy 1 or 2 sessions, see how you get on at first. You want someone who you feel comfortable with. And you should be asking them questions. You are paying for them. Like what their past success with people has been. <br>  <br>  Is it worth it? In my opinion, no. maybe if you are 400lbs of an obese mess and you are too lazy to motivate yourself and have money to burn. Then sure. <br>  If you are smart enough to motivate yourself and browse the internet, sign up to forums, you'll get advice from people who actually do what they talk about. <br>  <br>  Some personal trainers just get the grade in it, and it is all theory they have learnt about. They haven't actually gone through it themselves. I'd recommend a personal trainer who is or has been in the past a bodybuilder themselves. <br>  <br>  I'd rather learn from someone who's been there rather than read about it in a book. <br>  <br>  As for your final question, can't help you there due to being in different locations. You should ask at your local gyms. Popular, really busy gyms are usually not for the serious though. Unless it's golds gym! :-P
fmdWrtBaaa	Absolutely call the dentist or a doctor. You may have contracted an infection while you were having the work done and may need antibiotics. It is potentially serious, so make sure you do. Depending upon your age, you may also want to have x-rays taken to see whether your wisdom teeth (third molars) are coming in. I remember my entire upper teeth hurting when mine wanted to "be born."

You know sugar free gum?  Chew it on that side and this will dispurse pain on a short time scale.  Now you know Oraldine mouth wash, wash with it for a few days. If pain persists you need to have the nerve taken out (not as bad as it sounds), its basically just drill out filling, kill nerve and refill.

Is this more or different than what you've experienced in the past? If so, see a doctor immediately.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you mentioned a discharge coming out of them. I don't mean to scare you, but if you are having discharge (and not milk from lactation), you need to go to a doctor immediately. That is not normal and can be a sign of something extremely serious. It may be something small (like a breast infection).... but there is a possibility that it is something very serious. Don't wait... see a doctor now!

YLhwwndqaa	dear Sabifnak,<br>  Earaches are symptoms of infection, or something causing irritation. Both of these problems if remain untreated may lead to hearing loss. The most commonest form of earache is caused by a condition called Otitis Media a common infection which can eventually cause damage to the sensitive operation of the middle ear. Pain is a warning that all is not well and you should seek the opinion of a doctor or audiologist as soon as possible. If permanent damage occurs then you will experience hearing loss, so the sooner the cause is found and treated, the better.<br>  Wishing you well.<br>  Maureen|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I'm not sure that earaches would be a "symptom" of hearing loss, but if you have a severe earache and do not get it treated I'm sure it could lead to hearing loss.  If you have an earache, best thing to do is see a doctor--you do not want to risk losing your hearing.  Hope this helps.|`|ZNnPNgZOaa	im no MD but I have heard that before.  Have your hearing checked.  My son has a lot of earaches and I have been told if I don't watch it he may have hearing problems when he is older.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Ear infections can lead to hearing loss if untreated.
6fjMtWboaa	Yes it can increase your risk of hypertension.  You might want to see your dr, perhaps he/she can recommend another BC pill for you that won't affect you.  Also it would be a good idea for them to check your BP to make sure it's not being masked by the BC pills.  Either way don't let this go on long, you don't want to up your risk of stroke, or kidney disease.
XVe2Jkbsaa	I hate that! I always get them if I put on lotion right after I shave, at least if it's thick or scented lotion.

Also get new razors and make sure to use a good shaving lotion, preferably one for sensitive skin.|`|WQULO92xaa	Yep, definitely try a change of razors, specially if this is a new brand for you or if the company has changed the composition of it's soap strip...

I think addiction affects the whole family unit not just the addict.<br>  I think your hate stems from the fact you feel let down by your dad and you feel unsupported as he doesn't realise how important your status is with your friends and how his behaviour reflects on how people may see you. This is the embarrassment part. this hurts so you hate your dad as a result, but love, hate solves nothing. And that is why your mum who is also probably affected by this situation isn't listening to you, you need to speak to a counsellor as a family and explain living with addiction and about how you feel about this with your mum. In the meantime, I would suggest you make alternative arrangements with your friends and maybe meet up elsewhere and keep your life separate that will reduce your feelings of your dad ruining your life and give your family space to work out your own problems.|`|KhOx6oTMaa	your really hurting yourself as well as your dad when when you say things like that.

Being a teen is rough, your old enough to see your parents behave badly but not old enough to do anything about it.<br>  <br>  You have 3 issues that need resolution:<br>  1. You are angry with an addict you are living with<br>  2. Your boundries are being violated<br>  3. The drama is driving you apart from your Mom.<br>  <br>  Decide what you want, and what is in your power to change. You cannot make you Dad be sober. You can't make your Mom understand. You *can* defend your boundries, either by trying to change your relationship with your parents, or by getting social services involved.<br>  <br>  If I was in this situation I would try to change the dynamic so I was more of a "roomate" than a child. This will take some work and maturity but it could drop the amount of drama you have to deal with.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting a job so you have your own cash, this is not fun money, this is emergency monet. Once you have a few hundred bucks save up, you will have the freedom of options. <br>  <br>  Don't save the cash at home. Put it in a bank account. Tell your parents you have spent the money on eating out and clothes, don't give up your hard earned $ to the addict or enabler.<br>  <br>  On a good day, when everyone is in their right mind, you need to have a family meeting. I'm sorry, but you will have to be the "grown up" since your parents aren't stepping up. Basically you need to communicate that you respect them, but you need respect back in order for the situation to be healthy. <br>  <br>  Request to install a lock on your door. Your belonging are to be considered off-limits. Use your cash to put the lock in sometime when no-one is arround so it can't turn into a fight. Keep it locked all the time. Think of your room as an apartment. <br>  <br>  Get a mini-fridge to keep in your room and buy your own food. Again, you can't control Dad doing weird things to salad, but at least your salad will be safe behind a locked door.<br>  <br>  Don't have friends over to your house. You cannot control the bad behavior, all you can do is avoid being embarassed. Offer to meet friends out, at school, or at their places. Since you will have your own cash you won't have to mooch. If you are eating dinner at friends houses you can afford to bring a dessert etc.<br>  <br>  I also recommend joining a group for adult children of alcoholics. It might not be dads, drug of choice, but the problems are the same. This will give you a place to talk about your feelings and find a connection with people going through the same thing.<br>  <br>  In summary:<br>  Yes, you have be mad at your Dad.<br>  No, Your mother will not take your side, she has got her hands full.<br>  Yes, you can change the situation.<br>  No, you cannot change them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, God Bless!|`|hoLi0Kejaa	Woow, thats kinda harshh..but I can understandd why you do.<br>  Tell yourr mom you don't like him because he is always dooing werid things and isn't what a father should be...and that you wish he were a normall dad..<br>  hahah Thats pretty muchh all that came to my mind.<br>  If she doesnt understand, then tell your dad that your sick of him doing all these thingss and see if he changes.<br>  good luck girl!<br>  [=|`|Y2VsqIO7aa	You can't make your mom take your side of hating him. Your mom is having twice the trouble you're experiencing now. Imagine going home to a husband who's on drugs, taking care of kids, cooking meals and working all at the same time. It's too much for her. She needs your help around the house and your support. She's trying to help your Dad get better and to take care of you. It's normal for you to feel irritated sometimes. Was there ever a time when he's not on drugs that he treated you well? Then, remember that  every time you get irritated.If he stumbles around the house, then rearrange the furniture. Although it was a disaster, he's making an effort to help around the house by doing the laundry. If you're afraid that your clothes will be ruined then hide them and laundry them on your own. But keep in mind that: "You could always replace and get new clothes. They come and go. But you only have one father and he's irreplaceable." Accept the fact that your father has a problem instead of resenting and denying it. Then, make an effort to look beyond his problem. Think of his positive side. And support your Mom in helping him change. True friends will accept you and will still hang out with you despite your family's situation.True friends will stick with you through thick and thin. If they don't, then let them go, because if they're not around now that you need them then  they won't be around in the future too. But your family will surely be around in the future because they love you. The best thing that you could do for yourself is not to dwell on the negative but on the positive. Engage in a new sport or hobby that you like to lessen the stress. And do Pray.|`|q63zCT1Waa	Try to look at the good things about your father.  He's still your father no matter how much you hate him, so try to love him.  It might sound hard at first, but open your mind and heart up to him.  Maybe even talk to him about how you feel about his bad habits, and add in that you still love him and give him a hug.  You might even begin to actually like him after doing all of this.  It'll make both of you feel a whole heck of a lot better.  Talk to your mom too.  Have her sit down with you somewhere private or sometime that you're father's gone so you can discuss how you feel about your father.

Showers actually dry out your skin (though usually it's hot ones that do), so you should 1. use a body wash or soap that is moisturizing, AND 2. put on lotion after you get out of the shower.|`|I8szWmVMaa	you could take a warm shower i guess. Also you can dry yourself off quickly. I know they have anti itch cream at local convenient stores. Maybe this would help if you put body butter or lotion right after you dry off.|`|izFtmVCYaa	put moisturizer on to keep ur skin hydrated and switch ur soap to something natural.|`|spFmMOL2aa	put a water softener on the water feed.|`|GFHRpDE4aa	You can't fix it, it's because when your body is colder or the air is cold around you it makes your blood run slowly through your body, then when you get into a hot shower it speeds the blood up, making your skin get itchy from the rush of the blood, the only way to make it less likely to be itchy is to take a colder shower or make your bathroom hot before a shower.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]|`|XoDUTquWaa	DO NOT shower or bathe in HOT water even though it feels so good when it's cold out. This causes over drying of the skin especially if you are prone to dry skin any way. I know this does not sound like the most glamorous cure but I paid a dermatologist good money for this. After leaving shower or bath do not dry skin. 1st massage a small amount of Crisco into wet skin all over or to the most troublesome areas. Massage it in until completely absorbed. Then gently towel dry skin by patting not rubbing. It is inexpensive and will heal the most troublesome skin without allergic reactions. It's really great for people with sensitive skin and it really works. It's well worth trying and good luck.|`|loqsl5xXaa	it could b from them treating the water!! i get like that sometimes too.. U can use lotions and change your body wash. sometimes shampoo and your conditioner could be behind it too. Just change one thing at a time and go from there. <br>  <br>  always a good idea to keep your skin hydrated and drink more water (i have a prob. with that myself)|`|jNm1eIzBaa	The air is really dry in the Winter and like you might get some help with some kind of moisturizing cream. You might need to put it on a couple times a day for a little while until you start to notice a difference.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	When its cold out, your skin dries out really easily, plus people tend to take warmer showers when its cold out, and hot water dries out your skin.|`|7Y2EkSY8aa	Take some baby oil in with you to the shower and rub it on your skin right before you get out of the shower.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Use some body lotion. Your skin gets dried out in the winter.|`|lA8mfDvJaa	idk... take a hot shower..?|`|SiTnSLUDaa	Maybe your soap or body wash is not suiting you, so you should try changing it.
W2z5dCrmaa	Ligaments are slow to heal, and one difference is that your way taller now with longer limbs and more body leverage so to speak for doing more serious ligament damage. Once you tear them right off in spots, they never reattach, like bad ankle sprains. The remaining ones get to strengthen to try and pick up for the ones that are gone.<br>  <br>  At 18, I sprained my ankle really bad by wearing like biker boots with a thick heel and leather straps around the back and over the ankle part of the boot...you know the ones that I mean. Anyway, the high heel caused the ankle twist when I stepped down over the highway edge onto the ditch slope, and it was a bad one. At 23 now I need to watch it because the ankle is still weak and twists easy and still swells up. I do exercises to strengthen my ankles but it takes forever.<br>  <br>  I wear basket ball boots or runners like in staying out of high risk foot wear. It's not about healthy, just change in body type and more ability do do damage with it. Haha!<br>  <br>  Take care Man<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|xuCY36yWaa	YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE THAT TRY TO STAY HEALTHY, BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. SEEN IT MANY TIMES. PERHAPS YOU CAN NOT HANDLE PAIN.

For me, I need someone who can support my treatment and illness - if not, I'm probably better off without that person.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	1. Mental illness is a real disease.<br>  2. Doctors are experts in treating disease.<br>  3. Anyone who does not want you to be treated for your illness doens't want the best for you.<br>  <br>  Breaking up was the right thing to do. You didn't lose him because you wouldn't stop the meds, he left because he did not accept that you were not well.<br>  <br>  Like any other serious illness you may find some people are not able to cope with the reality, and they may not be good choices to date.<br>  <br>  After the relationship starts to get serious, way before you get engaged... you should talk to your next boyfriend about your illness. No one likes to be suprized. <br>  <br>  Your illness isn't contageous, but it can effect those who love you. Give your partner a chance to show you he is serious about what's best for you. Anyone who is scared off by it wasn't going to stand by you in life's ups and downs.|`|6h5slqFnaa	Taking care of yourself is the most important thing.  If he is putting some crazy ideology of anti-medication before your health, happiness, and well-being then he either doesn't care as much about you as you thought, or he needs to be with somebody with beliefs compatible to him.  Keep looking, you will find the right man for you :)  And props for putting yourself first!  I've heard so many horror stories of people with bipolar and schizophrenia not taking medications because their boyfriends didn't think they needed it - couldn't get past the "social stigma" of having a mental health problem.  If someone is going to marry you, they have to accept ALL of you - they have to love you in sickness and in health.  Don't settle, and don't deny who you are.  A strong woman like you will get over this and you will find somebody loves you for exactly who you are.|`|olopisx7aa	That has to be the dumbest reason to break up with someone ever. If you need your meds, then you need them and he shouldn't want you to stop taking them if they are helping you.<br>  <br>  He's not worth it, you need someone who will support you.<br>  <br>  Just be glad you didn't get  married, he'd probably divorce you for putting too much pepper on dinner.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	If he doesn't want you to take your meds, that is very unloving of him.  I know after 7 years, it will be hard to just go on, but you need to mourn this relationship.  He was not good for you.  You need to keep treating yourself as the doctors recommend and find someone who will accept you and your medications.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	Stop what? Stop him from being stubbornly ignorant and a jerk? Just imagine being MARRIED to this clown. That'll stop you.|`|NrrIDQlIaa	there are mental stigmas everywhere unfortunately and it also varies how bad a stigma by culture but uhh i would not suggest you stop your meds for him...you have got to be well enough for yourself and then to love so you can be well enough for other people as well...the best way to attack stigma is very slowly...explain all you can about the disease (how it affects you moreso than others but), that it is a disease just like heart disease or lung diease the chemicals in your brain an organ are not being recieved as they should be, and let him get to know you personally so he can see you instead of just a disease...and some people you wont be able to change their minds, some people are too stubborn which is only their loss not yours...do whatever it takes to keep yourself well and possibly try and explain your oddities just like anyone else can act socially awkward and have oddities about them you can interesting things about you too...you worry but that also means that you care, there are positives to anxiety, others who dont know what its liked are just afraid of the unknown since they will never be able to understand what it is really like...|`|eBEfZO9eaa	Hopefully, you will meet someone who will care about you for who you are no matter what medical issues you have.  As for your health, maybe you could ask your doctor if it is ok to incorporate nutritional and herbal remedies, which might possibly allow you to take less medication and/or eliminate some meds.  Good luck to you.|`|lo5MkhG8aa	You don't need people like that in your life specially if your taking med.<br>  I used to take Lexapro but stopped it was making me really anxies.

AA11374522	It's probable that you simply hate to see it end. Many readers experience a similar feeling when they finish a good book. After being let into the story and into the lives of the characters within, you develop some level of attachment. When the movie ends, you are suddenly thrust out of the story and back into a mundane,  uneventful (by comparison) life. You are forced to leave the sides of the characters, never knowing how they will end up nor fully understanding who they are.<br>  <br>  One of the ways you can combat this feeling is by creating change in your life. As a previous answerer said, you can work to create action in your life by engaging in physical activities such as self-defense classes. However, the changes could be as small as changing around your wardrobe or taking different routs to work. <br>  <br>  Change, even small change, keeps the mind active and helps combat feelings of stagnancy. While you will probably never experience the lives of James Bond or Lara Croft, mixing things up a little in your daily routine may give you just enough excitement to pull you out of your slump.|`|4i2e231Oaa	Maybe the action in the movies is something that makes you really happy and once they're over you feel a bit let down? Maybe a solution would be creating more action in your own life, whether it be exercise, outdoor activities, taking martial arts classes, or even a career change to something more exciting ! (Not sure if you already do any of these, sorry).|`|XAIiOFkXaa	We all get affected by environmental factors in different ways.<br>  This is not the right forum to phsyco-analyse anyone.<br>  Most of us either deal with it or avoid the offending situations, like you should weigh up the +ives against the -ives decide if you enjoy the films enough to suffer the consequeces or  avoid those types of film|`|8azLDJ9Caa	You want action in your life|`|AA11707163	if these movies make you sad, don't watch them.watch movies like invincible or rudy ! rocky 1 !

x6dkY2aNaa	I have had pain on my left side of my jaw for a year now, and I was diagnosed with TMJ, very painful. I lived on advil daily, and also did some jaw stretching that seems to help alot. Eating non chewy foods helps alot. I still have pain, not much else has helped me. I also had to wear a mouth piece at night, helps with teeth clenching.|`|S9vnARx8aa	Your wisdom teeth may be coming in and putting extra pressure on your other teeth. grab some ice and chill your jaw (10 min at a time) and then make yourself a dentist appt.
P3HbFSn7aa	I can't sleep unless I do these thing (It might be different for you tho )<br>  Think of a colour and think off all the things in the world that are that colour- you'll lose concentration and gradually fall asleep<br>  Think of a dream you want to have-  fairly elaborate but not confusing and day dream it it'll help you wind down.<br>  Try reading something boring before you go to bed or even just a book- while in bed and it relaxes you and again helps you wind down.<br>  <br>  Counting sheep has never helped me but using creative ways always helps, you might be different- so if you're better at maths you could imagine number/times tables/ shapes or so on.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend medicine, but that might just be me.|`|MDsufhrZaa	possibly tylenol pm, or a small bit of nyquil but i dont suggest that for health reasons.<br>  just relax and clear your mind, avoid caffiene and food before bed.<br>  while your laying there never open your eyes and visualize something calming so your mind doesnt rush. i usually think about playing fetch with my dog.<br>  <br>  hope it helps.|`|63tch8D5aa	oh man i m the same way,<br>  <br>  <br>  take a sleeping pill.|`|7NG6OHZbaa	IDK|`|rUjQM1biaa	Take a big shot of NyQuil works every time|`|QueLLNiraa	I have the same problem. I go to bed late a about 11pm - 1am every night.<br>  <br>  Here's a natural way of doing it without ingesting any chemicals into your body.<br>  <br>  Avoid naps at all costs! They can make you stay up all night, even if your tired avoid naps! They should be no longer than half an hour otherwise your body mistakes it as your sleeping time.<br>  <br>  Meditation also helps alot. Just lie on your bed and relax down, calm down.<br>  <br>  Avoid high energy drinks that contain any caffeine before you sleep.<br>  <br>  If this happens again, warm milk is a stimulator which helps you get to sleep better. <br>  <br>  Another tip is that you should avoid doing things in your bed, eg. Reading on your bed. (Don't ask me why, reseach has been proven that it's a psychological factor).<br>  <br>  Make sure all lights are off before you sleep, remove all distraction and worries. <br>  <br>  Write up all your worries somewhere and forget about them until tomorrow morning.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11739944	don't take nyquil.

f8fd7e1b2e70baaf1b4a26dd0e05b39daa	I'm pretty sure the folklore is actually the other way around, that wearing wet socks AFTER you have a fever will draw the fever down to your feet, helping the fever go away.<br>  <br>  Whether that works or not, I couldn't tell you, but I'm quite sure it won't give you a fever, and would probably just be really uncomfortable, and give you wrinkled feet ;).|`|LPPpzSGAaa	if the water is cold then you should get a fever, also go to sleep with a fan blowing right on you I did that and I got a fever in the moring
6fjMtWboaa	Could be an enlarged lymphnode that is fighting some infection that you may have being that you are sick.  I would see your dr, you might need antibiotics.|`|C2qdLfKdaa	it's probably a swollen lymph node...<br>  it may have been swollen due to some sort of stress on your immune system.<br>  your cold probably just made it worse..<br>  even though the possibility of it being cancer is really low, its always better to get it checked out, if it remains swollen for like 2 more weeks after your cold is gone.
loqsl5xXaa	the thing is.. you really should go to the dr and have it done. normally it isn't done by your pmc doc. they usually send you out to a dermatologist or if there is one in your building he'll/she'll do it. You can ask for a female. But see usually when they remove it they have to cut beneath the skin to get the "legs" out of your body as well so it doesn't grow back. plus they always like to make sure it isn't cancerous. if you don't get it all then it cold grow back and it could be cancerous the 2nd time around. There isn't anything to be scared about or ashamed of.<br>  <br>  be safe and do it at an office.

sBVmxwqhaa	You're fine...many girls dont start their periods until they're much older, even into their early 20's.  Your body is just getting used to having a period.  I'm 24 and dont have a period every month because I have long cycles.  It just depends how the month falls.  What is important is that you count the number of days between periods, not the months.  Start with the first day of your period as day one.  The last day you count is the day before the next period.  It should be some where between 26 & 35 days on average.  If it's shorter or longer, dont worry.|`|HouzERhsaa	its ok it is normal your 13 and just got it not even a year ago ur body is just getting use to it im 15 and i started at 13 and mine comes lates so dont worry|`|1aJjFrUCaa	you may have irregular periods. that is quite normal hunny.

You really need to rule out 1 of 2 things.  PCOS and thyroid disease, these 2 can go undetected and really wreak havoc on you and your body.

jAouwgtlaa	This is normal, all females in general get this, although only after you have hit puberty, so I am surprised you have not had it before now.  It is your body's natural way of keeping yourself moist and healthy down there.  Also it cleans away any bacteria.  The discharge should be white or clear, if it is anything other than that or has a strange texture/smell, it could be an STD so get checked ASAP.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	its normal, you can't stop it and it has nothing to do with virginity..<br>  it's called being hormonal.|`|c42a426f28c9fd509f9cc8dd1cb7d303aa	haha thats cute, well your 15, most teens have the strongest sexuality! since your starting out you will get horny all the time!! try masturbating, look it up to find out how lol<br>  so you can start satisfying your self a bit more!|`|cae3920de07aa32ac6f35149da7938a4aa	Idiots. (others, not you.)<br>  <br>  What's happening to you is a very normal thing. The vagina constantly produces a natural vaginal discharge which functions as a cleaning agent. It's your body's way of flushing out and preventing infection. It's not the same as ejaculation due to sexual arousal, so just because you're wet doesn't mean you're horny and masturbating in the morning (as some morons suggested) does not change the amount of vaginal discharge you'll be secreting the rest of day. I know it's annoying and uncomfortable but it'll happen for pretty much the rest of your life.|`|Uv9z5ZHSaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArC2R7sPEa9Bmp3Ber8UE2vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221195627AAE872E">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|wrLu93C9aa	YOU need some good "loving", A lengthy session of Amore!|`|OLy54IDOaa	ur horny or ur body is cleaning it out down there|`|WQULO92xaa	Well there is one thing I can suggest:<br>  <br>  - Every morning before you step out of the house make yourself *** (ejaculate) to your hearts desire... (you can use your fingers or candle or similar object). This will ensure that your body (and mind) are satiated during the day and will not secrete lubricants in your vaginal passage in anticipation of (you know what) the rest of the day.|`|8EHYNBNtaa	Does "vcard" mean virginity? Well, if you're getting wet too often, you might have a sexually transmitted infection. Once you lose your virginity you need to go get a check up and pap smear. Getting your panties wet all the time is NOT NORMAL.
TRrTunqvaa	well rashes are caused by different things, and treating time differs.|`|wWcUSPygaa	This seems like an odd question....<br>  But It depends on who you are<br>  You can scratch yourself alot<br>  Some people are allergic to some soaps/laundry detergents, so that could be a cause.<br>  Or maybe it's a plant like poison oak that got to you.<br>  Anyway, just use anti-itch cream and don't itch your rash, and hopefully it will go away. I guess it depends on it's severity.

If you can't figure it out. IE: are you doing more physical things than before, are you in puberty, have you had an annual physical? You have to almost make a check list to see what has changed recently & then see a qualified Physician. You can not self diagnose, nor can we via a short bit of info. You may have high blood pressure, you may have a myriad of things or you may just not be sleeping in REM sleep so you actually require more to get what before was adequate. You may have sleep apnea. Like I said there are way to many things that may be a factor & reason why. See a doctor if it continues!<br>  AB|`|fwWq2llXaa	For me it was.  Abilify helped me with this tremendously
ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence is addressed in section 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".|`|fmdWrtBaaa	I am really sorry to hear that you are so down on yourself and have had a seriously abusive relationship. In short, your mother failed you. Whether verbally or nonverbally, she communicated a dislike of your body probably even as an infant. She or another close female relative, such as an aunt, also pelted you with a steady stream of criticism. Every criticism conveys the same message: you aren't good enough. She probably had an abusive/neglectful mother herself, which is not meant as blame. Suffering abuse is never an excuse to be abusive to someone else. You do need to see this link, however, in order to understand and begin to see the patterns that recur in your life. Once you are able to see a pattern, you are 80% of the way toward breaking the cycle for good. You will probably need the help of a therapist to do this. Stay away from male therapists who will see your insecurity and if they have poor ethics, may try to take advantage of you. Female therapists may perceive you as competition, so if you catch any wierd vibes, move on.<br>  <br>  To help impove your self-esteem subliminally, go to www.meditationmovie.com and listen to the brief meditation with your eyes closed at the beginning and end of each day. I know its message will really hit home for you. Good Luck!|`|8bI3BIRJaa	Hey there.  Sorry you're feeling down and out.  You just need to build on your spirituality.  You need confidence...

If you think that physical appearance is so important and critical to a value of a person, you should distract your attention away by doing something different. eg. request yourself being skillful and professional in works rather than being beautiful; train yourself to be a person with wisdom rather than to be someone who is beautiful in physical appearance. <br>  <br>  Why should we be so beautiful instead of other good qualities?<br>  <br>   I know this is difficult but we can improve it gradually. We can not spend hours and days by looking into the mirror and ignore other dimensions of life. Forbid ourselves from looking into the mirror to find flaw on our physical appearance. <br>  <br>  Use the time to learn something that can make us happy. Gradually, we will find that we have gained more thing and less worry about the loss of our physical beauty.|`|UDaFpPp8aa	Hey there sis, chill out a little. Take a deep breath, smile and say 'Men are Bastards' Most anyway.<br>  The asshole in your relationship probably continuously put you down and said many nasty things about you yeah? Man, he's the one who's insecure and feels good when putting you down. He's the one with the problem not you! You need to hang out with happy, positive people and after a while, your confidence will grow back. Then you'll meet a sweet man who talks to you nicely, buys you flowers and will restore your confidence. As for looking in the mirror, ever seen the poster of a kitten looking into the mirror and the reflection is of a lion? How you see yourself is really up to you! I'm ugly and when I look in the mirror I see Frankenstein (without the bolts) Every day is a fresh start to something new and wonderful-if you want it to.  PS-Don't take any abuse or crap from any guy ever again..EVER...EVER...Now go and buy some nice clothes. PPS-watch Schrek again.
w51hObZyaa	I've had bad nightmare problems before. Try eating chocolate or some comfort food before bed. It usually brings nice dreams. <br>  Exercise a lot before bed, like some jogging in place or push ups. That will make you more tired and usually blocks out dreams.<br>  Put up a dream catcher. They may not work, but sometimes just the though helps keeps away bad dreams.<br>  Also, try to think of happy things before bed.

Iyvt7ibmaa	I wouldn't really know without pictures of seeing it, but my boyfriend has weird shaped ribs too. His look really boxy on both sides and he says it's from when he was a baby. He slept on his sides from birth and I guess the pressure of his body caused his ribs to mold into a more boxy look. Maybe that's it?
eaYtGz9gaa	Hiking is great exercise.  If you are in terrible shape, start by walking briskly around your neighborhood without a pack until that becomes easy.  Then add a backpack with a little weight.  Progress until you can easily carry about 12 pounds in your backpack easily.<br>  <br>  If you are already in reasonable shape, you can begin hiking mild to moderate terrain with a light backpack.  I find it more fun to hike with a group or at least a buddy or two.  If you don't know anyone that likes to hike, google "hiking clubs" followed by your town.  Most medium to larger cities have hiking clubs that welcome new-comers.  Not only do you get buddies to hike with, you get itineraries planned for you and advice of people who have hiked longer.<br>  <br>  As far as the health benefits?  Hiking increases your heart rate giving significant cardio-vascular fitness.  Hiking with a full pack on moderate trails will easily burn 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day!  Woohoo!  You can even get away with eating M&Ms while hiking! HA!<br>  <br>  Of course, hiking is going to develop muscles that you didn't know you had too.  Even at rest, muscles burn more calories than fat.  Therefore, even at rest, a fit body needs more calories than an unfit one.  <br>  <br>  We haven't even discussed the psychological benefits of getting out into the woods away from cell phone signals.  I'll let you discover those on your own.<br>  <br>  Have fun hiking and getting good exercise without even realizing it.<br>  <br>  For information gear, food, clothing and everything you need to begin ultralight backpacking.  See the website below.<br>  <br>  Happy Hiking.|`|Ug03kkN2aa	It most certainly is...but if you haven't done much hiking in the past, suggest you start off lightly and gradually work your way up to a more difficult stage...as each stage gets easier then you know its time to up the pace|`|tireoWI0aa	Absolutely, as long as you hike for at least 20-30 minutes.

You may just need some extra vitamins in your diet to boost your body. But please, please, please, be sure that you get second opinion if you are prescribed any medication. Google the medication and see if anyone has suffered side effects. Be sure that doctors get kick-backs from Pharmaceutical company's for pushing their products. If you get dependant on a drug at an early age, you may hooked for life. Look at America and see how many kids are prescribed medication for whatever reason and those poor kids are now dependant for life. (Google it) As for killing yourself...bar-humbug.

yQacZw5zaa	Lithium is known to have a negative effect on libido and may be a cause of erectile dysfunction.  Libido reduction and erectile dysfunction effects are common with anti-manic drugs and is perhaps a natural by product of suppressing that feelgood factor.  Lithium is an anti-manic drug (but it is also an anti-depressant).<br>  <br>  WHO defines sterility based on sperm count.  Lithium does not affect sterility from that aspect.  Alternatively, sterility might be considered the "inability to produce offspring", i.e. male fertility.  Since both libido and erectile dysfunction have their part to play in the normal ability to produce offspring, lithium might be considered to have some effect on the probability of a couple to have children if the man is on such a treatment.<br>  <br>  You'll have to make up your mind if any of this answers your question.|`|L5ie6msYaa	lithium is pollutant metal just like lead. there is a direct correlation between lithium and death in men women and you dog.|`|MsMrJgAVaa	what do you mean|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I don't know about sterility, but I have heard that it takes away your sex drive, often makes you lose your hair and gain weight.

Instead of listening to a bunch of yahoos on here that couldn't give a crap about you. See your doctor!|`|G07o0cHPaa	Better head to the store to find something to suppress it and get you some orange juice.  What actually fights the illness is just food and juice that have the vitamins your body needs.  "Medicine" does nothing but suppress the symptoms that are actually your body's defenses.  For example, you think the coughing is the symptom of the cold, but it's your own body's response to fight it.  Your body forces you to cough the cold out.  So "medicine" can suppress the cough but it's only suppressing your own defenses.  But it's not going to kill you obviously.  But like I said, if you really want to actually fight it, get plenty of orange juice, the oranges themselves, vegetables, fish, chicken, and berries.  But usually plenty of orange juice will do the trick.

NPpalf1Gaa	Well since you've had a tooth pulled in the past, you already know the after effects and how it will feel during the process. These nerves you are feeling.. completely normal. Keep the thought in your mind that everything will be ok.. nothing is being done that will harm you, only to help you. <br>  Also, maybe a little after your feeling better from getting your tooth pulled, you can treat yourself for doing such a good job and handling it well. And if your a bit younger, having a parent with you while it is being pulled may help because you will feel supported and safe:] If you can't do this, just rest assured that your dentist knows exactly what he or she is doing and is only there to help. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Gk181ojaaa	I've had 16 teeth pulled out, but I've only had experience with Novocaine, so I don't know what it's like otherwise. The worst part is putting the Novocaine in- so when that happens, think of something relaxing. It might seem stupid, but when I was younger, they told me to squeeze my hands and wiggle my toes- and it works! I'm sure all will go well. Good luck!|`|Gg4rq4MQaa	I'm sure you will receive some kind of a pain controller. the modern anasthetics are really good and you might not feel much at all.

8lYZROjuaa	Well, at least you have a check up with your doctor tomorrow. I hope you can tolerate it until then.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes a heating pad will relax a person, but not necessarily relieve pain.  Sure wouldn't hurt your stiff neck.  I use one for mine.  <br>  <br>  I'd say some relaxation would be beneficial.  Heating pad and some herbal tea which is for relaxing or to obtain a calm effect.  <br>  <br>  Do you have a friend or family member who could rub your neck and shoulders in a relaxing way for you?  Sometimes a stiff neck can be due to stress; as in you may be stressing out about the pancreatitis. <br>  <br>  God bless, and please tell your doctor about your symptoms tomorrow. <br>    <br>  Take care and hopefully you can rest a bit tonight.
a4kTbjfeaa	Pancreatitis should not affect your fertility. If your pancreatitis is due to alcohol you need to quit before trying to conceive. If it is due to gallstones you may want to discuss with a surgeon the option of having your gallbladder removed (if this has not been done already) to prevent future attacks of pancreatitis.

I talked to doctors about it and everything & they just told me that I didn't relax and wasn't completely comfortable. Finally, after about being with the same guy for 7 months or so I was able to. It came really naturally -- so I guess I was just finally relaxed. Everytime we have sex I can't do it and it takes a lot of foreplay for me to be calm and not thinking about a million things.

It is far worse for the guy who has had his penis butchered by a hack with a medical degree.<br>  Circumcision is an aberration of medical care.

I have heard that it can help keep a woman lubricated during intercourse.<br>  <br>  When a man gets circumcised it is a protective extra layer of skin that protects the penis that is removed. Most of the time this extra skin doesn't cause trouble but in some cases it can become too tight and cause pain. Reasons why people remove this skin is either religious or traditional reasons (Many Jews, Christians, Muslims do this), for hygienic purposes (people believe it is easier to clean) and other. <br>  <br>  But from a biological point of view no circumcision isn't absolutely necessary. If the skin becomes too tight one can always remove it once one grows up.|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Haha, uh no it's the other way around. Circumcision hurts a lot (from what I've seen and heard). But leaving it uncut doesn't hurt at all anymore than it hurts a girl. Most men in the world are not circumcised. It's just a cultural tradition in the United States and a religious custom for Jews and Muslims, otherwise boys are generally left intact and grow up uncircumcised.|`|EwmHsEoiaa	Only 20% of the world's men are circumcised.  Most of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision began in the late 1800's to stop boys from masturbating among other silly reasons.  This only happened in English speaking countries.  Most countries have never circumcised.  Circumcision was never that popular in Britain and had died out by 1950.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.  In Canada and Australia it died out in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% of boys are circumcised in these 2 countries.  The USA is the only place it is really done.

With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  the glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.

kpKBwOcnaa	You say you self harm to deal with pain relief, I consider you maybe need to a therapy that can help you to address these emotions as it seems that the cutting is merely the symptom of difficult feelings and emotions, I think your mum is right, but I think you need to explore some of the different types of therapy to get the right one. It seems to me that you have very turbulent emotions that are quite difficult for you to manage and also cause you pain. I am wondering more what is at the root of your emotional distress, also reading material in regard to Bi polar and getting to know your illness, your symptoms I can pretty much gather you can predict what stress ors trigger off your episodes by when your cutting is at it's worse, you do understand that one way or the other the cutting is perhaps helpful to your emotions but it isn't helpful toward your healing, cutting only further encourages feelings of worthlessness trapping you in a cycle, you cannot heal yourself by hurting yourself that just doesn't work. What you do need is to find some other methods to stop this and I think therapy would be a start.|`|ETcBRko3aa	How many times are you going to ask the same question or something similar????<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmfcFzpJ6igRIg_r2YSz02jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222173400AA0P7nV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvmqVIsV1w0LZ5MH.mlXhb7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221235559AAkQrN0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An9E2i4iy1KQtYYYYzxuxifsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221183039AAvN3xe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|eCtrOR3Baa	No one can tell you if they will put you on meds or not, that will be up to your doctor.

But otherwise you probably somehow pulled something and the doc. will probably give you a muscle relaxor and maybe some pain med if it's real bad.  For over night, use Tylenol and Advil alternating every two hours if it's killing you.  If you are okay, do it every four hours.  If you need to take something else after two hours just take the opposite of what you took the first time (tylenol and advil are two different pain releivers and this is how you can do this if necessary)  You may want to get some tylenol pm even if you're having problems sleeping.

I do not know how long this lasts. <br>  <br>  2.

AA10818655	I get chronic migraines and they keep me home occasionally. There is no test for it, so even if you are taken into the doctor all they can do is question you. Wince a lot, complain about loud noises and sounds, breathe very slow and shallow (this lowers your blood-pressure and can sometimes make you look pale), complain about being nauseous, seeing weird colors (or tunnel vision), act disorianted, stare off into space, and if you're daring even go into the bathroom and wretch a little. It's a throbbing pain that's not very localized. You won't want to move your head very fast, and curl up with a pillow in a dark room. If you can cry convincingly, that always helps. Pop a couple asprin if they're offered to you, and be adamant about not being able to function. It's a lot like faking the flu, you just don't need to come up with a fever. I'd look up migraine symptoms and memorize them (though I labeled all the ones I personally get). If she volunteers to take you to the doctor, don't fear it, just be dedicated to the act--you might get some great pain pills in the process and you won't be questioned if you decide to act it up again. What's great about this to is that it can hit suddenly, and disappear as suddenly, so it /is/ possible to be flat on your back ill in the morning and be perfectly fine by evening. The typical migraine lasts anywhere from 4-72 hours.|`|7Y2EkSY8aa	Intestinal cramps works pretty well.|`|a71d6398b9b54fe96b5da7798ed275f0aa	mono...but that will only work if you wana miss a whole month or two LOL then your kinda screwd...go with sinus infection, tell her your gums hurt, your forhead and cheek bones and neck itll work..

Part of the abstract is below:<br>  <br>  J Affect Disord. 2009 Apr;114(1-3):32-40<br>  <br>  Spirituality, religion and suicidal behavior in a nationally representative sample.<br>  <br>  Rasic DT, Belik SL, Elias B, Katz LY, Enns M, Sareen J; Swampy Cree Suicide Prevention Team.<br>  <br>  Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University, Canada.<br>  <br>  BACKGROUND: Studies show that religion and spirituality are associated with decreased rates of mental illness. Some studies show decreased rates of suicide in religious populations, but the association between religion, spirituality and suicidal behaviors in people with mental illness are understudied. Few studies have examined the influence of social supports in these relationships. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between spiritual values and religious worship attendance with twelve-month suicidal ideation and attempts. Regressions were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and social supports. Interaction variables were then tested to examine possible effect modification by presence of a mental disorder. RESULTS: Identifying oneself as spiritual was associated with decreased odds of suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio-1 [AOR-1]=0.65, CI: 0.44-0.96) but was not significant after adjusting for social supports. Religious attendance was associated with decreased odds of suicidal ideation (AOR-1=0.64, 95% CI: 0.53-0.77) but not after adjusting for social supports. Religious attendance was associated with decreased odds of suicide attempt and remained significant after adjusting for social supports (AOR-2=0.38, 95% CI: 0.17-0.89). No significant interaction effects were observed between any of the tested mental disorders and religion, spirituality and suicidal behavior. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional survey and causality of relationships cannot be inferred. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that religious attendance is associated with decreased suicide attempts in the general population and in those with a mental illness independent of the effects of social supports.|`|7da94e3c936a7afc3d03e6dc12b85b9daa	There are many religions that don't recognize mental health issues. I recommend looking into controversial topics (article wise) examples: catholic view on mental illness and judaism view on mental illness. Then research christianity and mental illness. If you have access to internet and research articles (try the library) just type in "religous debates on mental illness".|`|fmdWrtBaaa	Being religious is often a smoke screen for mental illness, in my opinion. I have known some very sick religious puppies. There is, however, something to be said for surrounding yourself with like-minded people. The key is to make sure that it is a circle of sanity not insanity - you need only quote the sad consequences of following charismatic "religious" leaders in the late 20th C.|`|TdqeC0vmaa	I would say largely no more than anyone else because mental illness is due to chemical imbalances brain functioning and raising. <br>  <br>  However I think it can affect positively those who are suicidal. Their spiritual beliefs may keep them from doing so.<br>  <br>  negatively<br>  If they are psychotic however their spiritual beliefs may make them more delusional. They may discount their mental illnesses believing them to be demonic possessions or punishment for sins and not seek help.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	No, mental health is based on one's brain chemistry.  I know a pastor's wife that suffers depression and has to take medicine.  The main difference there are less suicides with the truly religiously devout.|`|1Y1CTj9aaa	Ha! Good question, but I've had mental illnesses before I turned to Christianity.|`|IkAtIQumaa	No some religions are insane.|`|NrrIDQlIaa	that answer really depends on what you mean 'greater mental health' to be...and i would say it moreso depends on the person but thats my opinion...
tMtBe1lKaa	Probably a wisdom tooth. It could be a cavity, or TMJ pain, which happens when you clinch your teeth often. <br>  <br>  Take some tylenol to help reduce the pain, and relax your jaw. You might have someone look in the back of your mouth to see if the gum covering where your wisdom teeth are is red and inflamed. That would help you know. Now is a good time to see a dentist.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Yep, I bet it's the wisdom tooth|`|6k5fhFyBaa	It's called TMJ.

Your brain may whiz out of control and start thinking about things other than your habit, not addiction (right) just a habit. TRY to stop blazing long enough to eat your mush. <br>  If it's really about the anxiety, master your anxiety. If you feel anxious, go out for a run or excersise indoors until you have no more energy. Take a warm shower, breathe deep, counting to 10 in and 10 out (without a pipe in your mouth). Do yoga, go swimming. Pot only makes anxiety worse over time. As you smoke more, you have more on you to be anxious about.. money, work, getting caught. not worth it.
W3bcdCymaa	Yes! It is the enamel on your teeth is wearing away! It is from the acid when you purge. Enamel doesn't grow back but you can make it stronger...

Take one puff and wait 2 minutes. then take another puff. You should give the first puff a chance to open you up a little so the second puff will get deeper. If you don't feel better in half an hour go to an ER or call your doctor. You'd be better off at an ER actually where they can treat you definitively right away.<br>  God bless.|`|pcI25NXzaa	I take two usually. Sometimes if I'm really really really really having trouble, i wait every 20 minutes and do it twice, until i feel a little better. Just do whatever it says on the box of your inhaler, and if you're having a bad asthma attack, do one more than that. HOWEVER make sure you do this with a fast acting inhaler and not one of those twice a day ones, there is a big difference and you don't wanna mess with that.|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	no more than 2 ! if nothing happens. it doesnt help. then go to er for breathing treatment. i had an idiot doctor when i was younger and he told me to take it up to 10 times a night! idiot almost got me killed. found out from a specialist. albuterol is SPEED! the drug speed. which is why it opens up your lungs so fast. but if you over dose. your overdosing on speed and can kill you. be careful. i have over used it so much *since i was 5 * now 24. that im immune to it. doesnt work.|`|speJXeIhaa	I normally take 2 puffs of my reliever during an attack,wait a few mins and take 2 more until you can breathe  'normally' again.The more you panic the worse you'll be though so stay calm- hard i know when you can't breathe.|`|nXM3AznEaa	1 or 2 no more than 3 at once .... if u have more than 2 its not good when i did i had to go to the emergency room cause my blood pressure sky rocketed ( i took 3 puffs ) the doc told me u cant take more than 2 . :)
9pLdhuBnaa	This bleeding could be an aftereffect of being on the antibiotics (an example only), but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
0rpN2419aa	Yes, I have diverticulosis that turned into divericulitis infections.  It was very serious and very painful in my lower left side and I had to be hospitalized with two different antibiotics and a regular saline solution dripping in my veins.  A surgeon was called in and I was at high risk for having a colostomy because the infection was raging by the time I got to the emergency room.  Thank God the antibiotics worked.  I can not believe your Dr.  prescribed pain medications because number one, they will cover up the pain that signifies he needs to experience telling him he needs to get something done and two, most pain medicines are constipating which will make the problem worse.  Has he see a gastroenterologist?  Has he had a conlonscope done?  <br>  He should NOT take laxatives because my mom did and her colon ruptured.  (I don't meant to be shouting at you stressing not...just want to make sure he doesn't take laxatives)  I was 58 or thereabouts when I was hospitalized. It is odd that mom and I have the same problem.<br>  He needs to eat 6 small meals throughout the day, consisting of healthy fiber rich fruit and vegetables, cut down on the fats, and not eat within 3 hours of going to bed.  He can drink milk or juice.<br>  <br>  I really am concerned about him taking the pain meds.  My Dr. gave me pain meds and it is a good thing I DIDN.T take them, or I probably would have ruptured because the pain would have been covered up.  Needless to say, after having to go in to emergency after my Dr. told me there was noting wrong with me, I changed Dr.'s.  <br>  <br>  Again.....NO laxatives because of the harshness of the pain they will cause him.  I still do have gastrointestinal problems and always will be at risk for infections again  Please watch him for signs of an infection...he will run a fever, have severe pain in his lower left side that may radiate up to his navel, and fever.  The pain meds really scare me.<br>  <br>  Did the Dr. check his blood for an infection?  The white and red count?<br>  Check the internet for divericulitis and check his symptoms against they sypmtoms listed.|`|f53WfMm9aa	Wish I had the answer for you on this but as I'm no doctor I don't. But I do wan't to say that as his husband, I applaud you for coming here and making the effort to find the answer for him. I agree with you and I'm sure there's better treatment.|`|H2ujc4Gvaa	Sounds like your husband's quality of life has greatly been reduced because of his disease. Maybe it would be time to consider surgery.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.
upvLAyyzaa	Opps.....<br>  <br>  Approximately 20 million Americans are currently infected with HPV, and another 6.2 million people become newly infected each year. At least 50% of sexually active men and women acquire genital HPV infection at some point in their lives. <br>  <br>  That's from the CDC website....much more reliable.

A TECHNIQUE FOR REPROGRAMMING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS: (ALSO SEE PAGE L, IN SECTION 2). When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", or a disturbing image, recognise that this is part of the mindset which will hold you back from progress. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large red "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" <br>  <br>  <br>  You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method.|`|qbzt3r4xaa	Yes... Be a friend.

It is wrong of them to critique you if they don't listen to you but you have to let it slide.  Do the best you can to stay away and eat the good stuff.  The biggest issue with this is money.  Organic foods and healthy foods are more expensive.  Perhaps a job is in order but there is a happy medium.|`|58H53s8maa	i agree with dan ha..but anyways just try and eat the healthiest things that you do have in your house..not every single thing can be junk..and try going to the grocery store with them and suggesting a few things that you want. then maybe after awhile they will see that you are really seriouse about this and try to change|`|ouEdxS5taa	want to trade houses for a day?<br>  <br>  edit: geez, it was a joke<br>  my house has zero junk food, wish i could have some<br>  <br>  i thumbs you up summergirl !|`|M8tlF8Yuaa	Don't eat the cake, candy, chips, soda, etc. Eating meat in moderate amounts is healthy. Just make sure you eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid the junky stuff they like.<br>  <br>  Instead of telling them to "eat healthy," give them examples of what you want. Say, "could you get me some apples and some stuff for salad when you go to the store?" <br>  <br>  Also, if you volunteer to make the healthy dishes that will help too. Maybe your parents don't know how to eat healthy. You can show them by your example.|`|988cef7150394dd70b851a71d9b84c1aaa	talk to your parents and tell them that when they go grocery shopping to let you get what you want to eat for the week.and maybe you are the one to change there eating from bad to good and help there health in the future you sound like a smart person I think they will listen to you eventually.GoodLuck|`|BYDPhlUXaa	Allowance, going to the grocery store, talking to your parents.<br>  <br>  Those ideas from other users are good ideas.<br>  <br>  DEFINITELY drink more water.<br>  <br>  Bring up the fact that you'd like to get a job, but you aren't allowed so could you do things around the house for allowance?|`|AA11378593	Go shopping as well and ask for an allowance towards foods you choose, or make a shopping list if you cannot go yourself and have them get things for you to eat.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Go grocery shopping with them.

Let them know that you want to do this for your health. When it comes to grocery time, go with them. They don't need to cut out all of the bad stuff, but as long as you can at least get some healthy things, you're not losing completely. Hopefully they can compromise!<br>  Good luck!|`|GcgrFMuNaa	When they go buy the groceries, COME WITH THEM<br>  so you can pick out the stuff.

dmsLrFQnaa	Arya: The best way to find this information would be through independent research. Asking questions here will get you plenty of incorrect information, such as the previous replies. A couple sites to start with:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/</a><br>  <br>  Wikipedia may not be the best source, but its citations point to many academic papers and credible documents. These are the things you should be reading.<br>  <br>  I will tell you now that years of scientific research on these drugs has only come to suggest that the risk of using LSD, DMT, MDMA and even cocaine is far lower than what the general public will have you believe. LSD and DMT, in particular, are extremely low in harm and dependence potential (especially when compared to tobacco and alcohol). <br>  <br>  Kenny: Which study is this? Please provide sources before you make such outlandish claims.<br>  <br>  Bunny: I'm shocked and appalled that you linked to Erowid (a credible source) after making so many absolutely bullshit claims.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Chronic use of ecstasy and LSD has been proven to cause brain deterioration. There was a study done a while about about chronic users. They did mostly the younger age groups (16-24).

Be careful with that one.  Also casual MDMA use will burn out your serotonin receptors, but occaisional use can be as safe as aspirin if used correctly.|`|aoCCeZgkaa	Diseases are the sure results when a person has long-term drug abuse to his/her body.  Cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis, kidney and liver damage, stroke, and all kinds of psychological and physiological illness.  The fact about these drugs is that it can only produce negative and harmful effects to the body, so it is better to avoid it.|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	With LSD, depending on if you're at risk of schizophrenia or not, it can cause you to go schizo. But that's only if you have the schizo trait in your DNA already. DMT, I don't know too much about, but from what I've heard, there's really no long term side affects besides from flashbacks every so often, but even then those are uncommon. Ecstacy is dangerous simply because all it does is dump your seratonin (the chemical that makes you happy) in your brain all at once. The problem with that is once your seratonin is gone, it doesn't ever reproduce to it's normal rate. So, the next day, you're going to feel like you want to kill yourself because you're so depressed. This is about a 50/50 chance it will happen. With long term usage with XTC, it can cause brain tumors and holes in the brain, but only if you use it ALOT over a long period of time. Cocaine kind of does the same thing, but with cocaine comes withdrawl, which is really hard to get over, and nosebleeds and it screwing up your mucus membrane. If you want to know more, I suggest www.erowid.com. It's a great place to learn the pros and cons of a lot of different drugs.<br>  Research what you're going to use, ladies and gents! :)
n7bok7NRaa	Blood is fine, swelling is not.<br>  <br>  For this sort of "injury" it may take a while for any vessels that were ruptured to permanently heal over.<br>  <br>  I would recommend cleaning it even more often than you have been (at least three-four times a day) and rotating it as often as you remember to. This will encourage scarring in the inside of the 'wound'.<br>  <br>  Slight swelling is normal, but if it gets painful when you're not touching it, turns purple/greenish or begins to leak any color fluid (save for clear/blood) you'll need to go get antibiotics, because that's an infection.<br>  <br>  You can take it out when it doesn't hurt in the slightest and hasn't hurt for a good week.
GiONso7zaa	Given I don't know the specifics of the child's behavior, however it needs to be taken into consideration that kids are more active than adults. Children having seemingly abnormal amounts of energy is nothing to be concerned with and in my honest opinion, you're reading ito it too much|`|13k2WKx8aa	Irrelevant. Drug use would have more to do with birth defects and developmental problems than with Asperger's and ADHD.<br>  <br>  Take it from someone whose parents are stone hard sober, never smoked, no real drug use. I have ADD.|`|8ryoShBpaa	Yes, I understand your observation.  What I have found is that those who are doing drugs are often self-medicating.  In that they have ADHD, or ADD, or anxiety, or concentration problems, etc.  They use drugs as a way to feel better from these symptoms.  Thus, they are more likely to have children with problems, because they pass on the toxins and pathogens that are making them ill.  <br>  <br>  Children are being recovered from ADHD, autism, etc. by treating for pathogens and toxins, which are certainly transferred via sex and in pregnancy.  Thus, it is appearing to be a genetic thing, but it's a pathogen-carrying thing.  Did you know that dental fillings contain mercury, and that doctors who are successfully treating children for autism and ADHD, etc, say that the mother passes on this mercury into her children, along with pathogens she is carrying that may not make her seem ill, but the children can get autism, ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, etc. symptoms from it.  Thus, know that there are pathogens and toxins in vaccines, but also in biting insects, foods (fish and corn syrup contain mercury), and pets carry pathogens, etc. that are being found in these children.  This is why vaccines can be a contributor, but currently not necessary to obtain autism.  <br>  <br>  Drug abuse contributes, more likely because the parents have stock-piled more pathogens and toxins than those who have not used drugs.  Either this state lead them to want to do drugs, or was a result from the drugs.  But, here again, it's only a contributor.  You can never have done drugs and still have children with all kinds of diagnoses.  But, the bottom line is that they are being recovered from treating for pathogens and toxins.  My children no longer have autism.

Symptoms of menopause. I suggest eating lower calorie foods such as fresh vegetables and fruit and drinking 64 ounces of water, or more, every day. Eat small meals throughout the day - 5 or 6 times a day. Carry health food bars (low calorie), dried fruit, etc. with you so you won't buy from the vending machine or candy at the checkout lane. You want to consume low calorie/low fat food. Carbs are good for you as long as they are healthy carbs - meaning complex or whole wheat type foods. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you experience at night or after each meal. Park far from the store in the parking lot so you have to walk. Walk around your building at work on your break. Do yoga after breakfast and crunches after dinner. Don't just eat a container of ice cream and a soda while watching television at night and go straight to bed. The secret to losing weight is to burn more than you consume. <br>  <br>  Lastly, start taking some herbal supplements to help with your menopause. This will alleviate your symptoms and help. My mom totally turned around in her attitude and how she felt after she started them.

Call Planned Parenthood. They have certain clinics where they perform the surgery. Make your decision quickly, because Planned Parenthood only performs abortions within the first trimester, which is the first 3 months of pregnancy since conception, rightly so. And if your schedule your appointment now, you may have to wait over a month to see someone. You still have a bit of time, so make a wise decision of which you are absolutely certain, because whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, abortion is a very very serious issue with serious consequences. Good luck, and please be careful in the future. Seeing as you're consulting a question-answer online forum to make such drastic life decisions...perhaps the level of maturity to even be sexually active is not quite there.

I3PdIX0Kaa	It actually sounds like you have fleas in your room..... or maybe even bed mites.  I would suggest one or two things.  Bug bomb your room and your house.  Read the directions carefully.... and then treat any pets you might have as well.  For bed mites, you are going to have to be more aggressive.  If you have a steamer, you can use that on your bed and pillows.  Wash the bed linens in super hot water.  If you do not have a steamer, it might be worth it to rent one.... or google another "cure" for bed mites.  How you can check for mites is to find the edge of your mattress where the piping is (along the side) and see if there are little red spots in there.  Those are bed mites.  For fleas, you can usually see them against white sheets...  If it IS spiders, the bug bomb should work as well.... and clean your room - under your bed, in the corners, the ceiling, around the ceiling fan... any place they can make webs...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ziRA9CIOaa	it could be your matress or there are bugs living in your room. try cleaning out from underneath your bed, other furniture, baseboards, and behind surfaces. if this doesn't work, then try getting a new matress or hire someone to de-bug your house. i had random spider bites for a week and tried cleaning out from underneath my bed and ive never had a problem since.|`|gzlz4i3Naa	no that's not a spider, that's me.
13k2WKx8aa	The Doctor is right. It's probably an infected cyst. That's actually exactly what I was going to tell you. ^_^<br>  <br>  Cysts are actually fairly common. Also, if it was something like breast cancer, #1 it wouldn't have grown so quickly, and #2 it wouldn't hurt to the touch at this early on.<br>  <br>  You have a cyst. It can go away on it's own or sometimes they have to drain them.|`|3z3P6j49aa	Its probably a cyst. Its very very rare to get breast cancer that young, and cancer bumps aren't red, and don't hurt.|`|W2pvqhbkaa	I would wait for the ultra sound.  A cyst sound like an appropriate diagnosis.  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself if anything rubs on this part of your body and may be causing a callous.  If you are not aware of anything you may have done to cause a blood blister or bruise then the only other thing I have ever heard of are tumors and cysts. <br>  <br>  I am not a doctor.  I have no medical experience.|`|H2ujc4Gvaa	Well, sounds like you already have a diagnosis. It IS probably an infected cyst (cancer lumps usually don't hurt), and yes it's practically impossible to have breast cancer at 14.
Xnr3sCZRaa	If you cannot distance yourself from the ignorance of these callers you should probably look for another job. There are lots of jobs in the customer service field that do not have the high rate of angry people that collection calls get. I have worked as a customer service rep for large company's and also as a receptionist and both are very rewarding. No matter what you do if you work with people you will face angry ones so eventually you will have to learn how to hang up the phone, and think to yourself that they were not really aiming their anger at you and move on. also I found that being overly nice and overly helpful really do help to defuse angry people. If you can get them to pause long enough to let you get a word in explain that you are giving them a solution to the problem not creating one (i.e. giving them a chance to pay their bill, not running up their credit cards), if you do it right you can help them to see that it is their fault that you are calling not yours (this is very tricky so tread lightly). <br>  <br>  Good Luck and try to stay positive!!!|`|PmG0Isnnaa	One thing I have done is to set up a side business on the side which, if successful, can grow into a full time business.  When I am miserable at work, I just think of the fun I can have later running my own business and the possibilities if I work to make it successful.|`|3SwWwR4aaa	Do a little something each day that will be in the direction you want to move in. The trouble many people make is they make drastic moves and this can totally upset their lives. Take a few moments each day to learn and move in the direction and job you want to have.........School, training, resumes.|`|spXPpyP0aa	get a newone|`|AA11707163	What i do is keep score with a friend of mine about how many of these lame brains are gonna give us a hard time today ! sometimes i win sometimes he wins ! you know it doesn't bother me anymore ! your not the only one don't let them get to you or they win ! shake it off !|`|Ovgp8QxJaa	Welcome to the world of customer service :)<br>  I think the best thing too do is just get to know your coworkers to the point where your all close and can share alot of jokes.<br>  I work in autoservice, and there is ALWAYS going to be that one horrible customer that will ruin your day. Its a part of working in customer service, just brush it off and keep on going. People have made me cry before. It just happens. Make the best out of it.|`|vMG0CHmgaa	I hate dealing with stupid, stubborn, stuck up customers every single day. Ever since I started drinking energy drinks every time before work, I just can't seem to care about what customers say to me until the drink wears off then it ruins my day if someone says something. I down a Nos drink and it puts me through the roof all day|`|LThcbFoGaa	Just don't take anything they say personally. Try to find humor in the things you hear from customers -- stupidity doesn't have a limit! The hold (or mute) button can be your best friend, and if you distance yourself emotionally it will be a lot easier.|`|aWZXeJR7aa	it's hard to get up every morning to do something you hate doing. but jobs are more harder to get these days. lucky you have a job. suck it up for now. when economy is better look for another job.|`|EozYN8ynaa	realize how great it is that you are not as miserable as those people. if you have someone particularly horrible, vent to someone about why that customer bothered you so much. honestly, don't worry about it. focus on the customers who were nicer than the others.|`|mzWNBtbqaa	HAHA I work in a call centre too, it's awful. Here's what I do when I get the bad calls. <br>  1) I write the person's address/phone number down on a piece of paper and put in my pocket. Then I daydream about either going to their house and slashing their tires or prank calling them at 3am and saying something really scary. I never end up doing anything, but at least it makes me feel better.<br>  2) I've learned a really good technique of mocking them without them being able to really get mad at me lol. When they say something completely ridiculous or something horrible my company did I give a wide-eyed "Oh my gosh" and "wow". The best thing to do is never lose your cool.<br>  3) I put myself in their shoes - both mentally and verbally. So if they are angry about a billing error, think of how that would make you feel and say something to that effect "I totally understand how frustrating that might be!" Kill them with kindness, only giant psychos can still yell at people who have spent the last 10 minutes sympathizing with their totally rude ranting. And sometimes it helps to think that maybe that person is totally broke, or abused or otherwise hurting - it helps to understand where the anger comes from.<br>  4) Always, ALWAYS keep working towards something else, callcentres have really high entry level wages for a reason, and if you become complacent you have just given yourself a life sentence. Don't do it! Just view your job as a means to an end and once you go home for the day put all the negativity out of your head. Never think or talk of work at home. As soon as you start to, stop yourself and start doing something else. Call someone on the phone, read a book, whatever you have to do.|`|qrGLcTh4aa	I hate mine too. It gives me chest pains and shortness of breath. I'm quitting tomorrow actually.<br>  <br>  I work nights in an urgent care center. People come in sick, bleeding, missing fingers, barfing, yelling and screaming,  all that while I registrar them and enter insurance info. At the same time I have to discharge people, take their payments and budget the finances for the day, fax rx's to pharmacies. I have never hated a job so much in my life. I leave there every night with heart palpatations.<br>  Do yourself a favor and quit. You deserve to be happy.
6YnwXCIaaa	You don't need to go to a gynecologist necessarily.  You can go to a family doctor who will be very competent in prescribing pills, testing for STIs, and performing Pap tests.  If you're 16, your parents would probably be okay with you going to see this type of doctor without them sitting in there with you; if not, just tell them that you'd like to talk to the doctor privately.  There are doctor-patient confidentiality rules, so it's not like your doctor can just tell your parents what you've talked about (unless you are going to harm yourself or are being abused).  So, getting the prescription itself shouldn't be too big a deal.  It sounds like your dad is being reasonable and willing to pay for the pill.  Can you just hand him the prescription and tell him you need it?  Get him to go to the pharmacy with you and pay for it?|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You could see if there is a Planned Parenthood in your area and go there for birth control pills or Plan B is needed.  The basic rule for gynecologist is at 18 years old or when you start having sex, so you need to do that.  You may just need to level with one of your parents about you relationship with this bf and I am sure they will want to keep you safe and do the right thing.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|XVe2Jkbsaa	I agree with the going to Planned Parenthood thing. They are very friendly and will give you birth control, condoms, and Plan B. It's free if you don't have an income, but they do like you to make a donation. Going on the pill is a very good idea, condoms are about 85% effective and you don't want to get pregnant at such a young age I'm assuming.|`|KXWoP078aa	If you feel old enough to have sex then you should feel old enough to talk to you parents, who sound like they are giving you an opening for you to talk to them.<br>  All young women should go in and have a complete exam, so they can be aware of all factors. Sex is beautiful, so why not keep yourself in good health so you can have a long and beautiful sex life.|`|B3qjtZuRaa	You said that you "just can't ask them now".  WHY?<br>  <br>  I'm not telling you that you should abstain.  That's obviously not going to work -- it's NEVER worked!!  Teenagers have a lot of sex.  That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always been (in fact, it's also called "anthropology").<br>  <br>  However, I have to say that -- if you "just can't" tell your parents the truth about yourself -- you might have to look at the possibility that you're just "too young" to deal with the world responsibly!!  It takes GUTS, HONESTY and CHARACTER.<br>  <br>  If you're too young and too scared to deal with it, you should admit that to yourself!!  You might also be "too young" for other things...|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Well, first you need to know how to spell condom if you're using them. I'm not saying don't have sex, but to be as safe as possible, you should wait three months until you can go to the doctor to get birth control. You can also go to Planned Parenthood and they will give you discounted or free birth control pills without parental consent.<br>  <br>  If you plan on staying with condoms, get ones with spermicide and make sure they are the right size for him (not too tight, not too loose) because that has a huge effect on their effectiveness. Make sure that he leaves a small space in the tip for semen and that there is no air in the condom after he puts it on. Don't use them more than once. Don't flip it over if he starts to put it on wrong. Store them in a room-temperature place and not in a wallet or purse where they can get worn or ruptured.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and please please please stay safe!|`|jAouwgtlaa	There is this thing called Planned Parenthood.  www.plannedparenthood.org  <br>  Some people think that you have to be expecting a child to go there but that is NOT true.  They help all girls whether they are just becoming sexually active or have been.  If you fill out forms they will supply you with birth control pills, condoms, etc. for free and it is entirely confidential which means that they CANNOT tell your parents.  Also since neither of you have ever been sexually active before you can be pretty certain that you guys won't come into contact with STD's, so a gynecologist isn't necessary.  Although it would be a good idea to get one just in case.  This I think can be found through Planned Parenthood as well.  If you enter your zip code into the website it shows your Planned Parenthoods near you.  There is quite a few, probably one in every town, even the little ones!
GiONso7zaa	he's probably just nervous or something.

When I was in ninth grade, it was considered nerdy. My lab partner in my science class used to tug at the loose end of my belt. He would also spin his pen around, snap his binder open and closed and turn the faucet off and on. I used to take my belt off and hang it in my locker before science class, and put it back on before my next class.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Maybe he want to tighten it so he looks hawter to you..... really it's anybody's guess.

862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	are you male or female?<br>  <br>  Either way, you're a little overweight for your height, but you're only 11! You're growing. As you get taller, that weight will distribute more evenly.|`|IlXW1s3xaa	overweight but not obese. Don't worry you're only eleven you should grow more. Most people are pretty chubby when they're little but thats just their body getting ready for a growth spurt. If your still large and 15-16 then you should be worried. Until then just be active and stay away from fast foods =)|`|KT8i2YL7aa	The most effective way to burn fat is to eat less food and exercise more, the issues surface when we really attempt to put that into practice! There are lots of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The only diet that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and CNN. I worked off 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|qhJZrYB9aa	It doesn't matter, you're young, so you'll grow into all the extra stuff your body stores.  If you're that concerned about your weight and appearance, talk to your parents, join a school sports team.  But don't bottle these feelings up.  It could result in an eating disorder.|`|m389Isf0aa	Why are people telling this 11 year old girl she is overweight?<br>  You are young, you are still growing and you body is changing.<br>  132 isn't fat, you are way to young to be going on any crazy diets so please dont do that!!!  If you want to be a little more active join a sport at school...   You are okay!|`|3ERx4opSaa	Well that is over weight if your only 4' 10".<br>  <br>  you should start being more active.|`|BYDPhlUXaa	Listen to me,<br>  <br>  Your weight should not be the reason you don't have friends. <br>  As far as school, people are always going to be cruel because it makes them feel better about their problems and how bad they feel about themselves.<br>  <br>  In terms of weight, you are overweight. I know that has to hurt alot, but trust me when I say it's nothing to hurt over too bad.<br>  <br>  Cry about it, get it out of your system, and once you do - make a plan to exercise. <br>  If you're close to your mom or dad - ask them to help you by walking a few miles with you. I'm sure talking to the people close to you will help.|`|ReNmXYiKaa	I do think that you are a bit overweight, but it will distribute more evenly around your body, that happened to me, I got a couple of growth spirts and it made me look a lot better.  But I do recomend trying to become more active, which could mean shooting hoops for 1/2 an hour or just playing sports.  <br>  <br>  Just don't worry about what other people think, as long as you are happy with yourself you have nothing to be worried about.  Try not to care about what other people think, don't let anything get under your skin.  Just keep reminding yourself that.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful|`|ji5vcwcvaa	You aren't fat. Don't call yourself fat. But to feel better about yourself you could eat healthier and be more active. Drink water and eat fruits and vegetables. You'll feel better about yourself. You'll be healthy and energized. Don't diet. Make this a lifestyle change. Be healthy for life and you will live longer. Good Luck :]|`|pdASSjn8aa	no way, you should just eat healthily and have a routine excersize and that's it, that's all you should be worried about. Weight is just a number.|`|5ZXAVeZVaa	Yes you are overweight.<br>  Even if its the truth.<br>  The ideal weight for your age and height is 89-110lbs<br>  You should be more confident even though you are. <br>  It could be your advantage.|`|jxYiY42Eaa	my b.m.i. thing on my i touch says that you are obese|`|DUa16Ka4aa	Babe...<br>  I refuse to call you fat.<br>  <br>  But, you do need to lose weight hon.<br>  And in your case, with your age, just eat healthy and less.<br>  Only eat when you are actually HUNGRY. With me, sometimes I'll find myself craving food just because I'm bored, and I've been struggling to knock the habit, and I'm doing good so far.<br>  So, only eat when you are hungry, and eat things like.. a whole wheat sandwich, lots of water, and fruits and veggies and lean meat, or protein like chicken or something, skinless though.<br>  With light seasoning.<br>  ALSO!<br>  Eat whole wheat pastas and salad {stay away from pale salad, try baby spinach} and things like that. They are extremely good and easy to make. Also make sure, when you do eat healthy foods like that, that you don't drown it in unhealthy toppings like creamy ranch. Try low fat ranch or vinegar based things.<br>  One more thing, don't think of it as a diet.. it should be a lifestyle. Eat how you are originally SUPPOSED TO.<br>  It'll work better in the end I promise.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if people aren't being your friends because of your weight, they wouldn't make for good friends anyway.

AA11030509	I have pretty severe astigmatism, and I wear contacts as well.  The AST contacts are thicker on the one side for a reason, so it moves into the right position on your eye.  It took me almost 2 weeks to get used them enough to not keep blinking all the time.  About a month to not notice them at all.  Give them some time, you'll adjust.|`|mVPBkUWSaa	I do. I wear Acuvue Oyasis for astigmatism.

It's just me, though. <br>  It really just depends on the person. Talk to your eye doctor about changing the contacts for a different brand that might work better.|`|1lewFV8oaa	I wear purevision toric for astigmatism.

My parents wouldn't let me see a therapist, but a few years later when I moved to my aunts house before I finished high school they demanded that I see one.

KhQ4do2Zaa	Sweetie, there's no such a thing as am I too fat to dance or am I too skinny to dance...Dancing is a language, a body language. Not a SKINNY body language or a FAT body language, just a way to express yourself without speaking. It's a fun, free feeling you get when you dance, and you dance because you enjoy it. Now in order for you to be a GOOD dancer, your weight has absolutely nootthiinngggg to do with it. Dancing is a feeling, and you need to feel the rhythm of a song in order to dance well. So don't put yourself down because ur friends are skinny skin sticks! It doesn't mean they can actually dance because they're skinny.

These are designed for strength, which will be obviously important in your sport.<br>  <br>  As for this stunting your growth, well I have to respectfully disagree with your father as much as that is not a comfortable thing to do. I absolutely think a workout regiment will benefit you.|`|OmsFqgG7aa	The fastest way to build muscle is to strength train. As you get stronger you build more muscle. Strength training focuses on exercises that work at least 3 or more muscle groups in one exercise: The best exercises are:<br>  <br>  ? Squats<br>  ? Deadlifts<br>  ? Chin ups<br>  ? Rows<br>  ? Dips<br>  ? Overhead Pressing<br>  <br>  Strength training avoids any major arm work like curls and triceps extensions. Strength training 3 times per week will build muscle.<br>  <br>  After your strength training (and cardio) your body will build more muscle by consuming a whey protein powder with some form of carbohydrates. For a 150lb male that would be about 75g carbs and 50g protein.

NnYXx5ASaa	If you don't have access to healthy foods, just keep track of your calories. Your not going to stay satisfied off of "unhealthy" foods like you would healthy things but if its your only option you can still lose weight it will just be a little bit more of a struggle. For someone like you who is somewhat tall like me, we need about 2,200 calories each day to maintain our weight. In order to lose 2 pounds a week you'd have to eat 1200 calories a day or you could eat say an extra 300-500 calories and just have to burn those off so your total each day is 1200. <br>  <br>  If 1200 is too hard do it slower so you have a better chance at not putting the weight back on. Eating about 1500 calories a week would make you lose 1.5lbs a week. <br>  <br>  Basically you just need to workout and eat less than 2,200 calories and you'll lose weight :)|`|5ZXAVeZVaa	Yes you need to lose weight. <br>  I have no intention of  trying to sound harsh or mean.<br>  the normal weight on your height is 118-159<br>  What you should do is eat slowly. <br>  It helps your food digest alot better and makes you fuller faster.<br>  When you eat fast your food doesn't digest well making you more hungry later on!<br>  To get rid of the stomach fat exercising would be the most effective way. <br>  going to the gym is a great way to lose the fat and tone up.|`|O1XyigGqaa	Well a website that helps me stay healthy and fit and up to shape is Women Prevention.

You should eat 5 small portions of healthy foods a day. For instance, a bowl of All Bran with a cup of coffee. At  about 10 am eat a piece of fruit and yogurt(light).

wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though). Still losing fat and gaining muscle.
aEUtmsYtaa	Things to think about:<br>  <br>  1)There are some surgeons in Mexico who have affiliations with US surgeons where a local US surgeon will provide your aftercare.<br>  <br>  2) Think twice about lap band out of the country, because US surgeons are not wild about doing the fills when they did not put in the band.  They tend to charge so much it negates the savings of going to Mexico.<br>  <br>  3) When you are self pay, everything is negotiable.  Discuss this with several surgeons and tell them you can afford to pay about the amount insurance companies pay, not full rate, you might be surprised how much less domestic can be.  By the time you factor in travel, lodging, etc, Mexico might not be as much less as you think.<br>  <br>  4) The American Society of Bariatric Surgeons (www.asbs.org) is there professional organization.  There you can find a list of all surgeons in your area as well as contact data.<br>  <br>  5) If you do go out of the country, DEFINITELY buy the complication insurance that is commonly sold overseas which is not sold domestically except for plastic surgery.<br>  <br>  If you email me where you are located, may be able to make more specific suggestions.|`|W8R6g5hEaa	I would be very careful, do your research. You want to make sure the post op follow up care is good, You will need to be monitored for at least a year out with the surgeon, dietitians and medical providers to see Baratric patients.

The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!<br>  <br>  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeon’s recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family.

It could also be nerves, muscles or  gastric reflux. Why havent you gone to the dr? if your afraid then dont be, they can only help. <br>  <br>  Imagine going to the dr and them telling you.."if you had only come in 3 months ago, we could have helped, but now the condition has progressed to an untreatable stage" <br>  <br>  You dont want that girl, go..go now!!! If you dont have medical insurance then seek low cost or free health care. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|Fmeiu9PVaa	You need to get checked by a cardiologist, sooner rather than later. There are tests and procedures that can be done that will determine if your heart and arteries are OK or not. Remember that there are other organs near the heart in the chest and one of them may be the source of your discomfort. For example, acid reflux can cause some real chest pain in the vicinity of the heart. Also chest muscle strain can cause soreness and pain around the heart.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I knew someone who, at 24, had an infection of the lining of his heart. I'm not sure what it is called, it is rare, but he had to drastically alter his lifestyle after it happened. Including quitting smoking and going on a low-sodium diet. <br>  <br>  If you have heart or respiratory problems, no amount of cigarettes is safe. <br>  Sorry if I sound preachy here (former smoker, can't help it sometimes.)<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what his symptoms were, but the point is that your body is telling you something. You're not getting any younger. Go see a doctor, and in a hurry. Do you want us to tell you that it's probably nothing? Sure, keep denying there's a problem, it'll go away. <br>  <br>  You can even go to an e.r.; they'll run a full battery of tests on you.

W2z5dCrmaa	The male body monitors the level of free testosterone in the blood stream by the pineal gland. If testosterone gets higher than the body allows, the pineal gland sends a chemical signal to the pituitary gland, which sends out an endorphin into the blood stream.<br>  <br>  The endorphin causes free blood testosterone to be synthesized into estrogen.<br>  Estrogen causes the testicles to cut down on testosterone production, or even shut down temporarily until the levels of estrogen dissipate.<br>  <br>  The pineal and the pituitary quit the chem. and synthesizing endorphin as soon as the lower testosterone is detected. The process isn't usually this rough, but this extreme gives how it works. It's usually way more balanced, and like an automatic thermostat to control testosterone production levels in the male body.In puberty there can be some big overruns in both directions.<br>  <br>  Breast lumps in boys, like under one or both nipples, known as "bi*thch ti_ts" ...are the outcome of a Dude having too high of estrogen in his blood stream. They will go away in time and balance. Prior to that kind of situation, he would have had a huge testosterone spike, sex crazed, and semen flying. Haha!<br>  Puberty can be a bumpy ride for some Dudes.<br>  <br>  Body building Dudes who take testosterone from external sources into the blood steam or how ever, run some big risks, because there is still a max. level that the body will try to achieve, so the controlling glands see it, send out chemicals to synthesize the high testosterone into estrogen, not realizing that the testosterone isn't in coming from his balls. How can they know, they just do their job.<br>  <br>  The estrogen shuts his balls right down, and now he is taking more testos. to override the estrogen to get bulking power out of external testos. Soon he has both high testosterone and estrogen.<br>  His balls remain shut down and start to shrink...known as atrophy. He is an adult, so his testicles won't ever come back again to where they were. The penis shrinks...like reverse puberty. It won't ever come back again either because forward puberty isn't achievable because at this mature stage, the pineal and pituitary won't allow that.<br>  <br>  Muscles will now bulk because of the high testos., but  bi*t_ch  t_its for keeps are at  risk of forming. The skeletal structure will start to grow and change because estrogen is a growth hormone. That's why when girls hit puberty, suddenly they are way taller than  the boys at the same age....That's because of the growth hormone effect of estrogen.<br>  <br>  The jaw will grow longer, the forehead will change a more square notable frontal lobe, and internal organs are at risk of damage, like liver, spleen and kidneys in particular from dealing with the toxins of the process as well as the immune system trying to resist the conditions. Bad water retention will happen. He will become aggressive, mean, cranky, tough to live with himself and potentially dangerous for his family to be around if he has a wife and kids.<br>  He will be functioning on a physical and logical level like males do, with the physical power of a male, but add all of the emotional aspect that estrogen contributes to a human mind, and that is a dangerous combination and formula. Men need to be less emotional because with their strength they become dangerous and aren't equipped or experienced to handle the emotional aspects.    <br>  <br>  The hand knuckles will broaden with bone expansion to look like ham hands, and arthritis is a common long outcome.<br>  <br>  My sex is up beside survival as number one on my list of importance, and the outcome of doping in this way is just so not worth it for my sex especially.<br>  <br>  Way too many words Man, but needed to answer your question as needed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|bf5cDEyZaa	In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm and may be necessary for a healthy libido.<br>  <br>  High levels of estrogen can cause reduced levels of testosterone, fatigue, loss of muscle tone, increased body fat, loss of libido and sexual function and an enlarged prostate.<br>  Long-term health risks including an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.|`|yid0jeX4aa	become more feminine

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	You have nothing to worry about, she is taking all the proper precautions. The HIV virus is passed through body fluids. <br>  But I commend you on your concern, if all people were as careful as you and your girlfriend, a lot less people would have AIDS.<br>  The HIV virus can be transmitted by needle sticks, splashes of blood. The Virus can be in the infected person's blood, semen, or vaginal fluids, and can enter your body through tiny cuts and sores in your skin or in the lining of vagina, penis, rectum or mouth. Strange how teens are touting Anal Sex as a way to prevent getting the HIV virus. Sorry but it does not work that way, anal sex can be just as dangerous.<br>  I would suggest one further step, if you are having emergency surgery this does not work, but if you are having elective surgery, go yourself to the hospital about a week or two before the operation and give a pint of your own blood, then do the same a couple days before the surgery. They will tell you the Nations blood supply is completely safe, still a lot of people each year pick up the virus from blood transfusions, to me, it's just not worth taking the chance.|`|G0O1M5XZaa	she cannot contact the hiv virus by touching the patient with gloves on. The only way would be if she was giving the patient an injection and got pricked herself with the needle or she had some kind of sexual things with the patient which i am sure she wouldn't be.  Hope this has helped you.|`|C2qdLfKdaa	neither one of you is at risk unless the patient actually bled on her or engaged in sexual activity with her (which is think is impossible.. just saying).|`|Eec9JeXbaa	you know us ppl with HIV, questions like this really hurt, because ppl so uneducated about it :o((<br>  <br>  You can only contract HIV though blood to blood contact...huge amounts, small cut will not really effect transmission.<br>  <br>  though unprotected intercourse.<br>  <br>  through oral sex, if the negative person would have open sores in their mouth or throat.<br>  <br>  anal sex<br>  <br>  and that's abou it... <br>  <br>  I really like that you are carefull, but it would help to find out more about it, so you don't have to freak out everytime you get into contact with HIV positive person.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	There are many people in society living with the HIV virus, and it's likely both of you have had some physical contact with them.  Unless there was transmitting of fluids (needlestick injury or sexual contact), there's no shot o getting HIV|`|DzpNel6Caa	im also a cna....you can only contract hiv from someone by being exposed to their bodily fluids (i.e blood, semen). as long as she is using special precautions with the patient you both will be fine.|`|XoDUTquWaa	Only if she recieves a needle stick from a needle already used on this patient.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Germiphobe ah?<br>  <br>  If she did have HIV then yes, you could get it from oral sex, but it is impossible to get HIV from simply touching an infected person. HIV can only be spread through body fluids. You have nothing to worry about.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	HIV is a virus that must be spread by blood or body fluid.<br>  It is not spread by air, or by touching intact skin.<br>  <br>  If you girlfriend is following all the safety procedures at her job the risk should be extremely low. Especially considering the "universal precaution" of the gloves.<br>  <br>  Even if she was actually stuck with a needle that was used on the patient, it is not guaranteed that she would catch it. Although it would be possible.<br>  <br>  It's is a good idea to get tested for STDs since you are having sexual relations, so good job. <br>  <br>  The activities you mentioned have not been proven completely safe with regards to HIV transmition, but they are among the lower risk activities.<br>  <br>  Considering all the information you gave, it sounds like you are doing everything you should be doing to reduce the likelyhood catching HIV.<br>  <br>  Specifically:<br>  1. You are monogamous and have both had blood tests<br>  2. You do not do high risk sexual acts<br>  3. Your girlfriend follows safety guidelines at work.<br>  <br>  If everyone was this careful everyone would be a lot safer.

I had an overweight friend a few years back who never masturbated, and then one day while we were talking about things that might help her lose weight, she brought up sex/masturbation for burning energy. She told me that she was scared to do it, but I told her that it was all right and that she should give it a try. The next day, she told me she tried it and that she thought it was the best thing ever. Not saying it'll work for your girlfriend, but it's worth a try. Either that or just put the moves on her already :p

ZuYTZ80Gaa	The docs are pretty good at trying to balance the side effects of meds with reduction of symptoms.  There are other options for bipolar disorder, and you should let your doctor know that the side effects are unbearable.  Certain medications such as seroquel, zeldox, lithium, and others are also effective.|`|ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer follows: See section 10, on bipolar disorder, at ezy build, below, and take the quiz, if unsure, and if the results are positive, ensure you get an expert diagnosis from a mental health professional, not doctors, who are much better dealing with physical ailments, and don't diagnose complex disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder often enough to develop any real expertise. <br>  <br>            Bipolar disorder usually involves major mood swings, which occur without apparent cause, and often over many months, or a matter of years, rather than days, as with most people (unless rapid cycling). Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. More about this on page R, in section 2.<br>  <br>           If you decide to use allopathy, (modern Western medicine) I recommend trying Lithium Carbonate, or Lithium Citrate. (regular tests are necessary, for these) before trying the other mood stabilisers, but if you aren't good at taking medications regularly, drinking adequate water, and keeping up your salt intake, something else, such as  Lamictal,  or Depakote, may suit you better. Check out "lithium"  at <a href="http://www.drugs.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/,</a> and <a href="http://crazymeds.us/" rel="nofollow">http://crazymeds.us/</a> and always research medications first, there, and at <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askapatient.com/</a> (read, and keep the labels/information sheets) so you will be aware of the risks, and on the lookout for side effects. Personally, if I wasn't bipolar type 1, and didn't experience hallucinations, or serious delusional states, I know I'd first try the orthomolecular, and Omega 3 fish oil supplements, vitamins, minerals; a herbal remedy, and a mostly raw food diet, for several months. Note: St. John's wort, and also antidepressants, may trigger mania, or hypomania, in people with bipolar disorder. I'd aso eat in accordance with my "nutritional type". Enter that term in the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a>  <br>  <br>           If not considerably improved, after a maximum of 6 months trial period, consult your primary mental health care provider: you may be one of those who need medications to prevent this serious disorder from worsening.  If you have bipolar type 1, an antipsychotic medication will probably be required. Everyone should take the Omega 3 supplements, or preferably "krill oil" for its other health benefits: use the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> (also enter "diabetes; type 2") Some people refuse medication, using supplements, and a selective, mostly raw food diet (I do not recommended trying this, if bipolar 1, unless you aren't troubled by hallucinations, or delusional states). There are various types, and degrees of severity with bipolar disorder, and although many people with the milder versions can get by without medication, using the alternative treatments, those whose disorder in more serious, really would benefit from taking it.|`|9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	There's no blanket "yes" or "no" answer to your question as what works for someone else may not work for you and visa versa.<br>  <br>  Tell your doc how things are going and let him/her advise you on what you should do next.  It might be to lower the risperidone or it might be something else.  They have a lot more experience in these things so I'd do it their way first before self-prescribing.<br>  <br>  With risperidone, many people will be uncomfortable for the first couple of weeks until their body makes the adjustment, so if you've been on it a short time your problem may resolve it self in a few days.|`|wTpBvti0aa	honey if youre that uncomfortable asking your doctor then you need a new doctor , or get over your aprehension.

I hope you look into it before deciding. the doctors will push it on you because they get paid by the drug companies for giving it out|`|soCH3ycWaa	The timing between HPV shots is supposed to be approximately three months between each treatment.

rzBxRw7Haa	If you are not happy with the information your doctor has given you, go back and ask them what they believe it is.<br>  Did your doctor mention piles (hemorrhoids) or did she find any little cuts around your back passage as these are common reasons for finding blood in the toilet or on the paper when you wipe.<br>  Did your doc advise the fruit etc because you are constipated, because if you are that can cause the little cracks or fissures to occur when trying to go, as everything can be overstretched to the point of splitting.<br>  I am 51 now but when I was your age I had the same thing, in fact I got off the loo at school one day to find the loo full of blood and this was down to being constipated a lot and having hemorrhoids, one of which was bleeding.<br>  I was told I was too young to have them treated and finally had them injected to shrink them when I was 18. This was extremely painful and I wish I had tried harder to eat more fruit and veg.<br>  So depending on what you doctor came up with, go back if you are not happy.|`|F08HDRvraa	Colo rectal cancer is a disease that older people usually have, not 15 year olds.  I suspect that your problem is probably a simple case of hemorrhoids.|`|94ccd8e8d81b10b0838eed1a1cc8ea82aa	Colorectal cancer in a 15 year old is rare but not unheard of. You need to discuss this with the family member who carries your medical insurance to see if there is a list of other doctors that your insurance plan has on call to go talk to. Explain you are not comfortable with this Dr. and would like to see some one else for a second opinion Do not discuss this with your friends or any one other then a responsable adult. Your friends might mean well but will give you a lot of here say advice that is worthless. It appears that your Dr. is not treating you as an adult by not telling you everything. I am an adult and had two Dr.s like that, they no longer treat me. i found one who was honest and talked straight with me. First I would go to another Dr. and get another exam, embarasing or not this is your life and your health we are talking about not some classroom gossipe. this is big time adult stuff so handel it as an adult. Second depending on what the second Dr. discovered I would ask whether you should go have a colon oscapy done because of the bleeding.  This is not a painful procedure that is where they check your colone with a camera and look for polups that could be canserous . when found early they snip them out like you would snip fuzz off a sweater. and thats that. I have had three of these done and they allow me to keep good health Some bleeding from the rectum is normal, your diet plays a big role in your digestive system which your colen is the last part. Fruit fiber and exercise help make you regular and soften your stool  if you have hard stool because of lack of moisture in your system  or because of what you eat regularly some times tiny fishers around the opening tears just a alittle that causes the bleeding but if it is happenng on a frequent bases then its time to get a second oppinion. If you feel you can't talk to a parent or who ever holds your insurance then talk to an adult that you love and trust. Such as a teacher or the mother or father of a friend. they will help you find a clinic or other health care provideer that can help you. Its your body protect it and guard it and keep it healthy|`|DgtKoTsQaa	Find another doctor, don't waste your time on one you don't respect.
AA11906603	Call the national Poison Control Hotline at 1-800-222-1222.<br>  <br>  <br>  I take Nyquil and Dayquil in capsules so there is no confusion. Still, Nyquil makes me very drowsy - even 18 hours after 1 dose.|`|13k2WKx8aa	She's fine. It's not going to do anything to her except make her tired. <br>  <br>  That's about it. Just tell her to drink some water and she should be fine.<br>  <br>  That is to say however that she shouldn't do this on a regular basis. It's strong and over time has potential to cause some problems, but once or twice within a day or so of each other is no big deal.<br>  <br>  Tell her to stop being such a worry wort. Also, don't mix it with Delsym. <br>  <br>  Story time:<br>  <br>  I accidentally OD'd on that stuff once with Nyquil. Worst cold of my life (acute bronchitis) and hadn't slept in two days. It drove me nuts to the point where I just busted open the cabinet saw it, and attempted to read the directions (three AM and I was pissed and couldn't see well). I didn't read it very well. I saw "2" and your standard measuring cup. Poured two tablespoons of the stuff and then stormed back to bed (I had already taken some NyQuil at that point earlier on). About four hours later I woke up, sat up, and then tripped balls. I lied back down and proceeded to call in sick to work that day. Something told me it wouldn't have been a great idea to show up there high as a kite (I'm against abusing any kind of drugs. This was a complete accident spawned from a month and a half long cold that turned into bronchitis).<br>  <br>  So yea. Moral of my totally irrelevant story, don't mix NyQuil and Delsym.

ZRgLHW3maa	okay, it is a possibility. but how long ago did this happen? are your breasts sore? and have you had morning sickness, or get sick when you smell or eat certain foods? those are usually the first signs along with the missed periods. take a home pregnancy test and even if it does say negative, still schedule a doctor's appointment to get blood work done. that is 100% correct instead of only like 97%. a home test could say negative even though you are pregnant. if it isn't that, then it could be a change in your hormones. a number of things can cause that, like stress, eating habits, smoking can, or just hormones. Good luck and best wishes to you and your man!|`|sBVmxwqhaa	Could be.  I've read that when you get pregnant there can be implantation spotting or that you may have some spotting when you would have normally started your period.<br>  <br>  You should take a pregnancy test just to be sure.  Take two because they can have false positives and false negatives.  Good Luck!  Hope the wedding isn't in nine months!|`|abf5d4fe2f9bae29c0d64b30a39b985faa	The only way to know for sure is take the test.  Other than that in my experience when you freak out or have higher than normal stress levels it can flat out stop your period dead in it's tracks.  My man and I had a scare like that when we were only together less than a month. <br>  Take a deep breath buy the test and CALL ME when you get results. <br>  I better be the god mother.|`|n5TwQt9Oaa	your probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  i would see a doctor.<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|z5JkgFOyaa	When a fertilised egg attaches to the uterine lining, this can result in light spotting or streaking (streaks of blood). Usually this only lasts a day or two, however do mention it to your doctor for safe measure.<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding is usually bright fresh blood like that which you would expect to see if you cut your finger. It can also be in the form of a pink mucous stain.<br>  <br>  If you think that you could be pregnant, I would recommend doing a pregnancy test or wait until your period is late and then take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

The acai berry is really high in anti-oxidants and really helps people loose weight . There are lots of health advantages to acai berries, but they must be frozen right after harvest to make sure they retain thier potency.

You do not want to mess with that or you may do more harm than good.<br>  As I say over and over, if something is over-the-counter or legal, it is because it doesn't work at all, or barely works and not worth the hard-earned cash you spend.|`|3DqNexwkaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry. I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight. So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.

The site was <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> - All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold, I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

S7GqsRWDaa	Not really, if you have a fast metabolism, you can eat whatever you want.  The best thing to get abs is workout with resistance, meaning not just regular crunches, but with resistance.  For example, lay down and put your feet under something stable, put a light dumbbell on your chest and do sit ups, this will build ab muscle better than just doing crunches.|`|bImYoZsraa	It certainly helps to have a good diet.  Eat healthy foods and keep at the exercise.  I would say if you exercise about five times a week, you'll see results within a month.|`|SUnBUBlUaa	Your stomach can be flat, but if you don't see abs you still have a thin layer of abdominal fat filling in the lines between your abdominal muscles.  Lots of crunches, sit ups, and cardio are obviously the best thing to target that area.  You technically already have a six pack (actually an eight pack), you just cant see it.

MJyM1XWJaa	STopping eating past 7:30 pm (my goal is 7pm but I started at 9, then 8:30 and so on) with only minor exceptions (late happy hour with friends) has helped me a lot. Also drinking lots of water and tea instead of any other drink, specifically oolong and green tea which are known to help you burn fat and lose water weight. <br>  <br>  Besides that just portion control. I try to be more mindful of how much of what I'm eating, so far I've lost a few lbs this week! Each person is different and if you try any drastic diets do consult your doctor first. But this is just healthy dieting.|`|qhJZrYB9aa	Eat veggies, fruits and stuff.  Stay away from meat if you don't exercise,  your body will just store it as fat.  You can take a cold shower, your body burns more calories trying to keep you warm, drink ice cold water (for the same reason as before) and drink cold water right when you wake up.|`|Y3HWASvPaa	The key for losing weight is simple - eat less and exercise more - the problems arise when we in reality try to put that into practice!

This also works on puppies too.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Nope !|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Well, yes and no.  You can't always control when and where things go off.  Some of it is hormone driven, and the body during puberty is still trying to get all that sorted out.  Sometimes thoughts can trigger the response, and sometimes sights or smells can do the trick.  The easiest way to deal with an unexpected rise in matters is to divert the thoughts to something definitively unsexy.   Grandma in a bikini usually does the trick.   The more you stress over it, the worse it tends to get though.  It's not a question of what kind of guy he is, though I'm not sure there are many kinds of guys, you sound pretty normal.  Sometimes it does feel like parts of you have their own opinions about things, and your brain nor you are in control.  I would just say try to chill and not get too excited about it.

But years ago I did have this nasty habit of biting my nails down to the quick.  It hurt really bad, that's why I wanted to stop. Gradually over time I stopped biting my nails like that but didn't realize at the time that I was stopping.  Then one day I looked down at my hands and noticed my nails were grown out and they didn't hurt anymore. I got to wondering how it is I had stopped.  Then I realized...I had somehow associated biting my nails with a mental picture of nails scratching a chalkboard.  Subconsciously every time I'd reach to bite my nails that horribly irritating sound and picture of nails on a chalkboard would make me cringe at biting my nails.  So my nails never made it to my mouth.<br>  <br>  My answer to you:  Come up with your own mental picture that makes you not want to scratch your head anymore.  Maybe imagining maggots embedding into your scalp every time you scratch your head will give you a picture repulsive enough to slow your hand.  That would sure get me to stop.  Eww.|`|zp92VY0Kaa	Use less conditioner.<br>  Shampoo twice or thrice. Haha, thrice.<br>  <br>  I like that word.<br>  Anyway, that's all I got for you. :D

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Most pills recommend that you take the first one on the Sunday that you are having your period.  So if you start on Thursday, start pills on Sunday.  Most also say that if you start them during your period, to wait 7 days before having unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.  I used them for years, was married, and never used a condom and never got pregnant, so it is up to you if you want to do that.  If you are not married, you might want to consider condoms to protect from STDs.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|9QC1MD4Naa	You're supposed to start the pill the Sunday your period ends.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills are 99.9% effective when taken RELIGIOUSLY. Most people do not do this, so, the chances of pregnancy are greater. Use a condom as a backup.<br>  <br>  The pill will become effective after one week of starting it.<br>  <br>  Also, read the information that came with your pill. It will answer a lot of your questions.|`|BIyiOgPYaa	You usually start it either the first day of your period, or the first Sunday AFTER your period is over. You will have to wait 1-4 weeks to forgo any protection, it depends on your brand. I have Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO so it's different than just OTC, but the instructions were clear in my booklet. Hope this helps, but if not, call your doctor and she/he will explain it better.
c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	These are not uncommon conditions and in most cases these problems resolve on their own without medical intervention.  Again - in most cases - these problems to do affect your blood oxygen levels.  There are some cases where the 'shunting' of blood is sufficient to reduce your blood oxygen level and in these cases medical or surgical intervention is required.  Even in the case of surgical intervention it is quite safe and simple.  For example - a catheter may be threaded through the right groin into the atrium and an 'umbrella' opened that will close a patent foramen ovale.  The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale are expected to close at birth or soon after.  If you have been told that you have one or both conditions then you have undergone an echocardiogram.  The echocardiogram would have determined whether one or both of these conditions was significant enough to warrant intervention.  I wish you the very best of health and may God Bless.|`|7PHKYCKDaa	idk but i wanna be a heart surgeon one day!!! isn't it so exciting lol i get to save peoples livessss im so excited=]|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	These are effectively shunts where oxygenated and deoxygenated blood can come into contact.

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	my doctors think i have endometriosis too :(<br>  and im only fifteen.<br>  sex has never been a problem for me though.<br>  <br>  gooooood luckkkk.

It's a decongestant.<br>  <br>  If you've got a Chinatown near you, and assuming the natural form isn't banned or restricted in your country, you can try an herbalist shop at your local Chinatown.  If they've no idea what you're talking about, it may also be called Ma Huang.

Because, when I applied after being run over by a train and being drug down the track 200 feet, and having my right leg crushed and torn off and breaking a rib and having my back literally skinned alive as I was being drug down the side of the track for that distance, and having in chip in the only ankle I had left, they said I WASN'T disabled, if you can believe that.  Their reason for saying I wasn't disabled?  They said I was too educated to be disabled.  No joke.  That's what they said.  And when I asked them what being so educated had to do with being allegedly NOT disabled after being run over by a  train, they said, (and I quote), "You had  a sit-down job before the accident and you can have a sit-down job again".  I can assure you that I'm a WHOLE LOT  more educated than that "person-of-ill-repute" who sat at that government paid job with as little intelligence and as little education as I KNOW she has.  I pray ya'll have better luck than me.  God Bless you.|`|9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	Having schizophrenia in and of itself doesn't qualify you; the question is whether or not you will be unable to work for at least a year or more because of the schizophrenia.  They will ask you to describe your daily activities and will look at your work history.<br>  <br>  And whether your doc recommends you or doesn't recommend you isn't as critical as your documented history about your impairment.<br>  <br>  And it is true that most psych disability applications are getting turned down these days.  The key thing is to appeal your denial within the number of days in your rejection letter, then when you get turned down again, appeal it again within the listed number of days.  <br>  <br>  You'll have to go through these appeals on three or four different levels until your appeal goes in front of an administrative law judge.  At that point you've got a good chance of winning.  <br>  <br>  You might want to hire a lawyer who specializes in Social Security Law to help with your application and appeals as they know what the right kind of documentation is to win your case.  You didn't use to need that but now days with so many denials it is not a bad idea.  They get a set percentage of your retroactive payment, and if you don't win your case they get nothing, so they're pretty motivated to win.<br>  <br>  The amount of time this take varies depending on where you live.  In my community it can take 2 years or more between initial application and winning an administrative law hearing.<br>  <br>  To find an attorney you can contact your local bar association which probably runs an attorney referral service.|`|NrrIDQlIaa	actually the hardest thing about ssd/ssdi is persistence...most people are turned down their first time and even second time (the government is a lot like insurance companies trying to weed out the less needy by claims) and it is also due to income...the best bet i would say is to get a lawyer to do your ssi case...(i usually am not pro lawyers but i am in this case)...they are limited to the amount of money they can get out of you if you get ssi/ssdi so they are less pernicious and all the forms and appointments are quite a hassle even for the sanest of people...(some will deny you though at first because they want you to try and get rejected proving you need assistance which helps their case and then theyll try you, others will try you at the very beginning)....i dont know of anyone personally with paranoid schizophrenia that tried it but know of plenty of people who have tried and eventually got it...i think only one of my friends got rejected and stopped trying, another one got it the first time...if you keep good documentation of his illness like his doctors and all that will also definitely help you...

Read this article to know about medical billing services and insurance claims.   The term medical billing refers to the process of submitting claims to the insurance companies and following them in order to collect payment for the services delivered by a healthcare provider. One can start his/her medical billing services to provide billing and collection to the providers. Many of the providers depend on medical billing services for processing claims to insurance companies (payer), instead of claiming themselves.<br>   <br>   A patient visits a healthcare physician for medical checkup or treatment. The patient gives information on his/her personal details (age, sex, location, etc.) and about the insurance company that he/she has taken up the medical policy. The doctor updates the medical record of the patient for further diagnosis, examinations, test, medications and treatment (if any). The information provided by the patient about the policy can be confirmed by contacting the payer.<br>   <br>   A qualified staff examines the medical record and translates into certain procedural and diagnosis codes. The medical billing company analyzes the data and performs services for the provider. Either medical billing services handle claims only or take care of both claims and billing. It is not easy to settle a medical insurance claim. The billing company has to bill the claim amount and fill up the claim form. Filling the claim form should be done carefully; even a single mistake on the part of the patient's details or treatments can lead to rejection and returning of the claim. Information in the claim should match with that in the policy document. Regarding any doubt, the billing company can verify with the patient and the provider.<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   The claim is then submitted to the respected insurance company in which the patient has a policy with. In some cases, the claim has to be submitted to a clearinghouse before submitting to the payer. Insurance company will further process the claim. If there are no mistakes, it determines the allowed charge payable for each service depending upon the patient's policy and accordingly, payment is done. Thus, a medical claim is settled.<br>   <br>   The medical billing services charge fee to the provider for their services. Some medical billing services charge their fees according to the number of claims handled, whereas some prefer to charge for a percentage of what they collect.<br>   <br>   Majority of the medical billing services use electronic billing system with advanced medical billing software. All the major tasks like filling up the claim forms, submitting claims and sending billing statements are done via the Internet. The advantages of using electronic billing service are it saves time and increases efficiency and profitability.<br>   <br>   Everyone must be aware about various health insurance schemes and their significance. Majority of the American citizens have medical insurance cover, which can be in the form of dental insurance, individual health insurance or family health insurance. One can take up disability insurance according to the lifestyle and risks involved. While taking up any insurance, it is very important for all the policyholders to have detailed information about the policy he/she has taken. One should analyze the policy documents and understand the coverage that comes under the particular scheme.<br>   <br>   Certain problems may arise related to the claims submitted via the billing services and the insurance company's payment. In such conditions, the cooperation of the patient is very important. He/she should give detailed information about the policy such as coverage of the policy and policy terms. If possible, the patient should call up the insurance company and inquire about reasons for denial. If the insurance company denies the claim, then the patient has to pay the medical bill to the provider. For genuine reasons, the patient can file an appeal against the insurance company.<br>   Other Blog<br>                                                                Money Professor ? Insurance ?

OzK10hKxaa	Well, yes and no.<br>  <br>  Eating whatever you want, non healthy foods like say a chocolate bar a day, you will lose weight. So in that aspect, the answer is yes, you can.<br>  <br>  BUT...<br>  <br>  For your body to function correctly, you need quality calories going into your body, which I'm afraid does mean those dreaded "healthy foods."<br>  <br>  So yes, staying within calorie limits by eating whatever you want does work, but your body wont thank you for it. Nor will you thank yourself. You will also have affects such as feeling tired and weak.<br>  <br>  You have to combine healthy with the occasional treat foods.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Choose a low fat diet.  It is more of a healthy way of eating than a diet.  There are fats in each food group that you can & cannot eat.  There is plenty there that you can eat without feeling hungry.

You will lose weight on this.  Good luck...Nala|`|tIldpr7vaa	technically yes, but u need to avoid sugars and limit simple carbs as well, its not all a calorie counting game<br>  <br>  the problem is that unheathy food usually has alot of cals so u will be eating very small portions to stay with in ur calorie limit|`|h9djwAVRaa	You can eat 2000 kcals worth of a cocktail consisting SOLELY of trans fat oil, white sugar, and MSG and you'll lose weight (if 2000 kcals does it for you).<br>  <br>  Orrrr... you can eat 2000 kcals of raw, organic fruits, vegetables, egg whites and whole grains and lose the same amount of weight.<br>  <br>  The only difference is, with the latter diet, you'll be able to physically EAT a lot more food, and you'll live to see the weight loss happen. :)

The biggest thing that the amount depends on is how recently he last ejaculated was.<br>  <br>  If he masturbated last night or this morning or afternoon he will come less than he would if he waited a day or two.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Well his physical size is not a determinate but a guy will small spuds ..

If a guy hasn't in like 2-3 weeks he could produce a lot. If he's doing his business very frequently 1-2 daily then he's likely going to be doing droplets.  Not to brag but to state a point I'm a small guy and I've shocked a girl or two with the amount produced.|`|XAkLPdhqaa	If a man has not had sex for a few days he will ejaculate more sperm.

And then, one day, I just did it.  It was strange at first, but like with all things, people get used to it.  Now, it would be weird if I had hair.  I didn't do it for any charitable cause.  I just got tired of dealing with it.  However, I don't completely shave it, only run the clippers over it at their lowest setting.  Quick and easy.  It's not a big deal, really.  Hair is dead.  And you can grow it back.<br>  <br>  As far as making money, there are places online where you can set up a site for receiving donations (might need to find someone 18+ to help with that).  Here's the first one I found:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Process/RaiseMoney/" rel="nofollow">http://www.justgiving.com/Process/RaiseM...</a><br>  <br>  Or you can set up your own site for free.

You'll need someone trustworthy with a paypal account to help with this.  <br>  <br>  Then you have to make people aware of it.  Send emails to friends and family.  Make fliers.  Call the newspaper and let them know.  Make it a challenge.  Say something like, "Once we reach $1000, I'll shave my head" [or whatever you feel your hair is worth. :)]<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Urkb5O8jaa	I'm not sure what you mean by your heart stopping...  But you might be describing a normal (but sometimes annoying or scary) thing called a hypnic jerk. It usually happens if you're overtired, fighting sleep, or not sleeping comfortably enough; something (they don't know what) causes the brain to tell the entire body to jerk violently. It's believed to be the same kind of thing that causes humans & pets to twitch & move around so much sometimes when dreaming.<br>  <br>  The most common type often feels like falling or being hit with an electric shock, and can get the heart pounding quite hard. One theory is that the brain sometimes reacts to muscles relaxing by thinking the body is falling or dying, and sends a panicked omg-get-up-right-away message out, literally jerking the person awake.<br>  <br>  The pages I linked to in my source has descriptions of the types that happen at other parts of sleep, if you're curious. I hope this helps, and that you sleep better!

AA11929981	acetaminophen and ibuprofen are both pain-killers, but they target different pain receptors in the brain. ibuprofen is better for inflammation, acetaminophen is better for fever. an example of ibuprofen is advil or motrin, while an example of acetaminophen is tylenol.  tip: if you suffer from bad headaches, instead of taking 2 tylenol or 2 advil, take one of each -- they target different pain receptors and will get rid of your headache faster (a good friend of mine is an ER doctor and told me this!).|`|JxY5WXF2aa	Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are used to stop pain. Acetaminophen differs from ibuprofen because it doesn't relieve inflammation with pain like ibuprofen and it can be used to break fevers.|`|nAe0sYrsaa	The other answers are very good but I wanted to tell you this also..acetaminophen absorbs in the small intestine where ibuprofen { which is acetycelic acid} absorbs in the stomach.

z5JkgFOyaa	If you are experiencing symptoms of menstrual cramps, it's important to see your doctor to be properly diagnosed. <br>  <br>  Although certain natural remedies show some promise, there hasn't been enough research at this point to conclude they're effective. Here are some of the more popular natural remedies for menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  Magnesium, acupressure, omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat diet, vitamin E, vitamin B1, heat (such as a heat pack, warm bath/shower), aromatherapy, massage, calcium, chiropractic exercise or you could go to the chemist and ask them for something for the pain if none of the above-mentioned helps.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if painful cramps during your period is so bad that it interferes with your daily activities or causes you to miss work/school because of it, that you definitely see your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation as painful periods can sometimes be caused by conditions such as endometriosis which can sometimes cause severe pain from an early age (although the pain typically gets worse as the disease does more damage with each monthly cycle). Other causes can include fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease and sometimes a narrowing of the cervix (using all these conditions as examples only).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|3SwWwR4aaa	Simple answer.<br>  No school or education = low income<br>  Education or trade = higher income and better life satisfaction.<br>  <br>  You are an adult, sometimes we need to do unpleasant things to obtain a better life in the future.|`|Xnr3sCZRaa	First - please get help, see a doctor or a therapist.

And I know that everyone saying "oh just suck it up and do it" don't understand that it's so hard. I don't know why it is, but it is.<br>  <br>  The consequence thing doesn't even work for me anymore. Sadly enough I've come to accept the consequences, but I feel that there's nothing I can do about it.<br>  <br>  Don't let it get to that point. See if you can get a hold of a guidance counselor and try to see if they can help you out and if need be, prescribe you some non-addictive meds. My biggest issue at the moment is that I never told anyone and never sought any help besides articles on the internet. So I never found any help. And due to that I've been paying the steep consequences for quit some time now.|`|sSpOCUGNaa	Zoloft is great for Depression.

Uma pessoa pode enlouquecer, morrer, e nunca ser encontrada numa floresta,se n?o tiver preparo e conhecimento de orienta??o com bússolas, GPS.Ou um guia<br>  que conhe?a bem a regi?o e seus perigos,pode-se cair num buraco fundo, quebrar um bra?o,uma perna,ou ficar preso numa armadilha e morrer de fome por n?o conseguir se soltar.Ou ser devorado por animais selvagens. Reflita bem, sobre isso.

b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Beim Morbus Hirschsprung handelt es sich um das Fehlen von parasympathischen Nervenzellen in der Darmwand. Durch die fehlenden Nervenimpulse kommt es zu einem überschuss der Aktivierung der Muskulatur und die Darmwand kann sich in dem betroffenen Abschnitt nicht aufweiten, es entsteht eine Engstelle (Stenose).<br>   <br>  Der vor der Engstelle liegende Darmanteil wird durch die Passagebehinderung sehr weit und es kommt sp?ter auch hier zu einer Transportst?rung des Stuhlganges (sogenannter Mega-Dickdarm).<br>   <br>  Die Krankheit ist angeboren und wird heute schon beim Neugeborenen bemerkt. Bei 4000 Geburten kommt es zu einer Erkrankung, Jungen überwiegen. Bei etwa 25 % der mitteleurop?ischen Bev?lkerung besteht eine spezielle Genvariante, die die Erkrankung bei Jungen bis 6fach und bei M?dchen bis 2fach h?ufiger ausbrechen l??t, als in der Gesamtbev?lkerung.<br>   <br>  Die Therapie besteht in der Entlastung des Darmes, so dass ein Riesen-Dickdarm nicht auftreten sollte. Diese Entlastung wird meist durch einen künstlichen Darmausgang vorgenommen. Nachdem das Ausma? der Erkrankung klar ist, wird der erkrankte Darmanteil entfernt (ab dem 2. Lebensmonat). Nachdem die Passage wieder hergestellt wurde, kann der künstliche Darmausgang wieder verschlossen werden. <br>   <br>  Ein normales Leben ist nach einer erfolgreichen Operation m?glich.|`|006b8164ab0ff10b2b7595b95f6eb9e0aa	Angeborene Erkrankung. Kommt auf 5000 Geburten einmal vor. Jungen sind 4 mal h?ufiger betroffen. Es sind Nervenstrukturen der Darmwand so ver?ndert, dass es zu einer spastischen Verengung des betroffenen Darmabschnittes kommt. Dadurch entsteht eine Passagebehinderung mit nachfolgender Erweiterung der vor der Verengung liegenden Darmabschnitte. Dieses sogenannte Megakolon kann man im R?ntgenbild erkennen. Die Erkrankung hei?t deshalb auch Megacolon congenitum. Eine frühzeitige chirurgische Behandlung des S?uglings, der durch einen massiv gebl?hten Bauch auff?llt, ist lebensnotwenig, da es sonst zum Darmverschlu? kommt mit der Gefahr eines Durchbruchs von Darminhalt in die Bauchh?hle und der Entstehung einer Bauchfellentzündung.|`|12e3f1ca9255663b5f864a94b56795f0aa	Beim Morbus Hirschsprung (Megacolon congenitum) handelt es sich um eine Erkrankung des Dickdarms, die zur Gruppe der Aganglionosen gez?hlt wird.|`|0db870e42a35aff800f2b613a4252a04aa	Schau mal hier:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbus_Hirschsprung" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbus_Hirs...</a><br>  <br>  dann kannst du dich ja weiter klicken...<br>  <br>  hoffe, es hilft dir weiter! alles gute!

77e87a292029be0adec952f9539afd9caa	Eine Schweizer Firma vertreibt seit kurzem Zimtkapseln, die gegen Diabetes etc. helfen sollen. Wie berichtet (MEDIZIN-WELT Top-Meldung vom 13.12.03) kann laut einer Untersuchung in den USA die regelm??ige Einnahme von Zimt den Blutzuckerspiegel und die Blutfettwerte absenken. Erste Recherchen von MEDIZIN-WELT ergaben, da? eine Packung Zimtkapseln mit 200 Stück zu je 250 mg etwa 20.- Euro kostet. Da ist es viel, viel billiger, Zimt über Joghurt zu streuen oder in warmer Milch aufzul?sen (Siehe auch unser Experten-Forum dazu).<br>  ------------<br>  Der Einfluss von Zimt auf Diabetes<br>  Einleitung<br>  <br>  Zimt wird vor allem zum Würzen verwendet, kommt aber auch als Aromastoff in der Parfümherstellung, in Kaugummis oder als Heilmittel zum Einsatz.<br>  <br>  Methodik<br>  <br>  Im Jahr 2003 wurden in einer Studie die Wirkungen von Zimt auf den Blutzucker- und Fettstoffwechsel bei Diabetes-Patienten untersucht. Teilgenommen haben 60 M?nner und Frauen mit einer Sulfonyl-Harnstoff-Medikation. Zun?chst wurde eine Einteilung der Personen in 6 Gruppen vorgenommen, von denen 3 Gruppen t?glich 1,3 bzw. 6g Zimt in Kapselform bekamen und 3 Gruppen eine Kontrollgruppe bildeten, die Placebos in Form von Weizenmehl-Kapseln erhielten. Die Einnahme erfolgte direkt nach den Mahlzeiten, die den üblichen Ern?hrungsgewohnheiten der Teilnehmer entsprachen. Die Studiendauer umfasste 60 Tage, wobei an den ersten 40 Tagen Zimtkapseln gegeben wurden und in den folgenden 20 Tagen keine Einnahme mehr erfolgte. W?hrend dieser Zeit wurden mehrere Nüchternblut-Analysen durchgeführt.<br>  <br>  Ergebnisse<br>  <br>  Ergebnisse dieser Studie waren die Senkung der Nüchternblutzuckerwerte um 18 bis 29% und die Abnahme der Triglyzeridwerte um 23 bis 30%. Weiterhin konnten Reduktionen des LDL-Cholesterins um 7 bis 27% und des Gesamt-Cholesterins um 12 bis 26% beobachtet werden.<br>  <br>  Diskussion<br>  <br>  Obwohl diese Studie einen Hinweis auf eine blutzucker- und blutfettsenkende Wirkung von Zimt gibt, entsteht daraus keine Rechtfertigung zu einer Empfehlung für eine therapeutische Anwendung, welches vor allem für die Verwendung von haushaltsüblichen Zimt gilt. Au?erdem ist zu beachten, dass Nebenwirkungen bei einer hohen Zimtaufnahme nicht ausgeschlossen werden k?nnen. In Folge hoher Dosen sollen beispielsweise erh?hter Puls, eine Erh?hung der Atemt?tgkeit und Schwei?sekretion, allergische Haut- und Schleimhautreaktionen beobachtet worden sein. Au?erdem sollten Patienten mit Allergien gegen Zimt, mit Magen-Darm-Geschwüren und Fieber unbekannter Ursache von einer erh?hten Zimtaufnahme absehen. Dies gilt auch für Schwangere und Stillende, da die Risiko-Nutzen-Einsch?tzung auf Grundlage der vorhandenen Daten nicht m?glich ist.|`|1ee3fac682caf3fb3533d9ca6bae7406aa	Eine gesunde Lebensweise und Ern?hrung ist für Diabetiker besonders wichtig. Nur eine ausgewogene, vitale Ern?hrung stellt sicher, dass unser K?rper mit wesentlichen Spurenelementen und Vitaminen, sowie Energie versorgt wird. Kohlenhydrate, wie z.B. Zucker sind für die Energiegewinnung im K?rper wichtig. Im menschlichen K?rper werden die Kohlenhydrate im Zuckerstoffwechsel durch das k?rpereigene Hormon Insulin in unsere K?rperzellen eingelagert. Produziert unser Organismus zu wenig Insulin steigt der Blutzuckerspiegel und die Glukose wird mit dem Urin ausgeschieden. Durch eine Ern?hrungs-Anpassung (Di?tplan) -Abbau von übergewicht und viel Bewegung lassen sich die Blutzuckerwerte h?ufig im normalen Bereich halten.<br>  <br>  Mit Zimt - Kapseln als di?tetisches Lebensmittel kann durch regelm??igen Verzehr im Rahmen eines Di?tplanes der Zuckerstoffwechsel günstig beeinflusst werden.<br>  <br>  Die Rinde des bis zu 12m. hohen Zimtbaumes wird zu Pulver gemahlen und als Gewürz verwendet. Zimt zeichnet sich durch seinen intensiven charakteristischen Geschmack und Geruch aus. Zimt - Gewürz - Kapseln für Menschen, die t?glich eine Menge an Zimt verzehren m?chten, was bei einer fett- und kohlenhydratreichen Ern?hrung verdauungsf?rdernd und entkrampfend wirken kann.<br>  <br>  Verzehrempfehlung:<br>  <br>  3 mal t?glich 1-2 Kapseln mit reichlich Flüssigkeit schlucken.<br>  <br>  Die angegebene empfohlene t?gliche Verzehrmenge darf nicht überschritten werden.<br>  <br>  Der Verzehr ersetzt nicht eine ausgewogene und abwechslungsreiche Ern?hrung.<br>  <br>  Inhalt: 1 Dose enth?lt 120 Kapseln a 415 mg = 50 g|`|0f9e5a98767458fd0a121f76591080c0aa	Ich habe gelesen, Zimt hilft z.B. bei Diabetes 2.|`|b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Der Glaube an die Hilfe kann Wunder bewirken.<br>  Zimtkapseln gut und sch?n, aber auf l?ngere Dauer gew?hnt sich der Stoffwechsel daran und der BZ steigt wieder(eigene Erhfahrung).<br>  Du müsstest t?glich schon mindesten 10 kg Zimt verzehren, um dauerhafte Senkung erreichen.<br>  Bin auch Diabetiker Typ 2 mir hilft am besten viel Bewegung und eine Ern?hrungsumstellung.<br>  Hba1c-Wert konstant 5,3|`|bbcd916f17edd1ce268040af1e7dd469aa	In einigen Drogeriem?rkten gibt es inzwischen auch schon günstige Packungen mit Zimtkapseln.

Dauerhaftikeit ist ohnehin das beste Schlagwort und nicht 4 Wochen und auch nicht 15 kg.<br>  <br>  Oh noch 2 Tipps, die mir gut taten: <br>  1) Sehr sehr viel Wasser trinken (Von Coke und Eistee auf Wasser umzusteigen fiel mir irgendwie am leichtesten und wirkt wunder) 2 l am Tag solltens mindestens sein, einfach immer nachschenken.<br>  2) Such dir etwas kalorienarmes zum Knabbern.

Schoki oder kleinere Portionen Kartoffeln/Nudeln/Reise/Brot), dafür mehr Gemüse, das satt macht. Viel Bewegung - auch Muskelkr?ftigungen sind effektiv, da sich durch Muskelzuwachs der Energie-Grundumsatz erh?ht (und man k?nnte theoretisch sogar mehr essen *g*); viel Kalorienloses trinken.<br>  <br>  Zu wenig zu essen ist sogar auch deshalb nicht gut, weil der Stoffwechsel, weil er unseren K?rper in Notzeiten schützen will, sich auf etwas ein Fünftel des normalen Energie-Bedarfs runterfahren kann. So braucht dein K?rper, wenn er l?nger eine Notzeit registriert (z.B. Hungergefühle), vielleicht statt 2000 kcal nur nur 400 kcal pro Tag. Das ist schlimm, denn dann würdest du selbst wenn du sehr wenig isst, noch zunehmen. Ist mir selbst so gegangen. Das ist gro?er Unsinn!! Lass das sein!<br>  <br>  Geduld und Willen zu Ver?nderung sind die Dinge, die dir bei deiner Lebensumstellung (Ern?hrung, Sport etc.) helfen. Ich hab letztes Jahr bei meiner Ern?hrungsberaterin gelernt, dass Gewichtsabnahmen von 5-10% des K?rpergewichts pro Jahr (!!!) gesund sind. Das muss man sich erst mal bewusstmachen, wie wenig das ist. Es muss wirklich langsam gehen. Der K?rper braucht Zeit, um sich an die neuen Stoffwechselverh?ltnisse anzupassen. Gib sie ihm! Sonst droht bspw. auch Haarausfall (kann bei zu schnellem Abnehmen passieren!). Das will doch keiner, oder?<br>  <br>  Ich drück dir die Daumen! Alles Gute!|`|2be6b3b56785814b6cc89dad7fec9df0aa	Die Einstellung zur Di?t zur Ern?hrung muss stimmen.<br>  Dann klappt es! Jedoch nicht in vier Wochen!!!

Das w?ren fast 4 Kilo die Woche. Wenn es so schnell geht, ist das meistens Wasserverlust, und der Jo-Jo-Effekt ist vorprogrammiert. Gesund ist etwa 2 Kilo im Monat abzunehmen. Das bleibt dann auch. Grunds?tzlich sollte die Ern?hrung auf Kohlenhydratarme Kost umgestellt werden.|`|62281f529003f8f1232d0caca64e1df1aa	gar nicht. übrigens solltest du bedenken wenn du zu schnell abnimmst hat deine haut keine zeit sich mit zurückzubilden und h?ngt dann. setz dir mal vier oder fünf kilo in den vier wochen, stell deine ern?hrung um oder geh zu den weight watchers (n kumpel von mir hat damit schon 10 kilo runter). viel erfolg!|`|69360298c87e36db5c9540c7acf96395aa	Das w?re zuviel in zuwenig Zeit.

Geh doch einfach mal zu deinem Arzt und lass dir einen Ern?hrungsplan erstellen.<br>  Du kannst dich auch in einem Fitness-Center anmelden und einen speziellen Trainingsplan erstellen lassen, um abzunehmen. Die meisten Fitness-Center machen das gratis (natürlich nur wenn du dich dafür bei ihnen anmeldest).<br>  Es geht auch leichter, wenn du jemanden findest, der mit dir abnehmen m?chte.

Das entspricht ca. 180g Fett. Wenn Du gar nichts isst, k?nntest Du also in 30 Tagen maximal 5kg abnehmen. Durch viel Sport liesse sich das vielleicht verdoppeln, also maximal 10kg in 4 Wochen. Aber danach w?rst Du praktisch tot.<br>  Soweit die Theorie. Vernünftig und realistisch ist es, pro Monat 1-2 kg abzunehmen. Das schaffst Du mit gesunder Ern?hrung und viel Bewegung. In einem Jahr kannst Du so die 15kg abnehmen, um die es Dir geht. Und dieses Gewicht kannst Du dann auch leicht halten.<br>  Alles andere ist Illusion.

Nimm dir vor 5 Kilo, das ist realistischer und zieh dass ganze dann aber auch durch nach dem Monat musst du aber unbedingt weiter machen sonst droht der Jojo effekt!!! So wirst du nach und nach doch noch deine 15 Kilo abnehmen. Und falls bei dir in einem Monat irgendwas anstehen sollte wofür du unbedingt top aussehen willst: keine sorge dass tust du auch mit nur wenigen kilos weniger. Und zwar nicht wegen dem gewicht sondern weil du dann einfach glücklicher bist!!|`|AA11475771	bullemie|`|ba2469dc144344f4a75bf19785d33e70aa	Das ginge wohl nur unter ?rztlicher Aufsicht im Krankenhaus mit einer speziellen Nahrung, die die wichtigsten Elemente enth?lt, die für die Aufrechterhaltung der K?rperfunktionen notwendig sind. Dafür müsstest du aber sehr krank sein und die Ma?nahme z. B. wegen einer OP unumg?nglich sein. Ansonsten ist das ein unvernünftiges, ungesundes Vorhaben. Ich habe in 8 Monaten 22 kg abgenommen durch eine Ern?hrungstherapie,die von Ern?hrungsberatern und vielen Arztpraxen angeboten wird. Es gibt Einzeltermine sowie Gruppen wie bei den Weight Watchers. 2 mal im Monat wird man gewogen und es wird mit einem Messger?t die Zusammensetzung des K?rpers gemessen. Darüber erh?lt man einen Ausdruck, auf dem die Anteile an Wasser, Fett- und aktiver Zellmasse dargestellt sind. Man bezahlt einen Monatsbeitrag und zus?tzlich das Eiwei?konzentrat, das man 2 x t?gl. in Magermilch oder fettarmen Joghurt gerührt zu sich nimmt. Die Hauptmahlzeit, die man frei w?hlen kann, also mal gemütliches Frühstück oder lieber Abendessen, Mittagessen mit der Familie, soll fettarm sein. Es gibt dazu ein Kochbuch, die Rezepte lassen sich gut für die nicht Di?t haltenden Familienmitglieder anreichern. Schmecken tut es allen, weil keine exotischen Lebensmittelzusammenstellungen vorkommen, die man sonst niemals verwenden würde. Auf diese Weise verliert man nicht ganz den Kontakt zu den "Normalessern", kann bei vernünftiger Auswahl auch im Restaurant essen. Das ist nicht so frustrierend wie alles abzusagen wegen einer Di?t. Und man bekommt keinen Hei?hunger, weil man ja seine Mahlzeit entsprechend kombinieren kann. Mann muss sich konsequent an 3 Mahlzeiten halten und reichlich Mineralwasser, Kr?utertee usw. trinken. Wenn es gar nicht geht, gibt es erg?nzend eine Brühe aus dem Programm, die einem z. B. hilft, wenn man keinen Tee mehr sehen kann und dringend etwas Hei?es braucht. <br>  Natürlich ist viel Bewegung angesagt - wie immer!!!<br>  Dadurch wird auch bei gr??erer Abnahme gew?hrleistet, dass die Haut nicht "schlappmacht".|`|bd60b598dd36e88f8a0cd5eacea73dadaa	Das kannst vergessen, alles wo Du auch nur ann?hernd so viel abnehmen kannst ist extrem ungesund und nicht von Dauer.<br>  Viel Obst viel Gemüse wenig Kohlehydrate wenig Fett kein Süsskram und viel viel Wasser, dann purzeln die Pfunde aber halt nicht ganz so schnell|`|c172e4d475d5fc2085ecf3634e8c98cbaa	Gar nicht|`|dd9056f32c62b03bf359baf975847ef1aa	Haare schneiden und Duschen soll Wunder wirken....<br>  ;-)<br>  <br>  Nein, nein...<br>  Du wei?t selber, da? das auf gesunde Art und Weise unm?glich ist, es sei denn Du nimmst die Chirurgie zur Hilfe.<br>  <br>  Stecke Dir ein Ziel:<br>  <br>  In 4 Wochen 5 Kilo!!!! <br>  Das ist realistisch.<br>  Sehr viel Bewegung, Wasser trinken ohne Ende und einfach mal<br>  auf Sü?igkeiten o. ?. verzichten.<br>  <br>  - 5 Kg ist doch auch was , oder?<br>  <br>  Viel Erfolg<br>  und <br>  LG<br>  <br>  (-35 Kg in 12 Mon.)<br>  Gaby|`|ddca6030145fcca93b7d51fb5618ba6aaa	Mit Nulldi?t.

It took someone I loved (at the time) telling someone else, because I was too frightened to do it. Told my student teacher whom I absolutly adored.

70b8fcefe3697f891dad9603df2a560faa	Circa un mese fa, durante una passeggiata-relax sul mare, improvvisamente il mio cuore ha iniziato a battere così forte che,  tastando il polso, non sentivo il battito. Le mie braccia si sono fatte gelide ed ho iniziato a sudare come non mai... Tutto questo per circa un'oretta! Il mio medico l'ha definito "attacco d'ansia" e mi ha "consolato" dicendo che non esiste una cura! Sei ansioso e basta. Il mio sbaglio è di accumulare ansia e di concedermi raramente al libero sfogo! Le benzodiazepine (lexotan, ecc..) possono servire sul momento, ma non risolvono. Perciò... il consiglio che potrei darti (darmi) è di liberarti dei demoni che tieni dentro..... andando contro ai tuoi convincimenti e a tutto ciò che ti condiziona. Tu sei importante, il resto viene e va....  Ciao da un ansioso che non vorrebbe esserlo e che lo ha ereditato sicuramente da sua madre che lo è!

AA12005596	Até hoje, n?o se sabe a extens?o do impacto que essas experiências genéticas podem causar ao homem e ao meio ambiente. Os impactos ambientais mais graves causados pelo cultivo de transgênicos s?o: a diminui??o da biodiversidade; a contamina??o genética (cruzamento de OGMs com plantas convencionais); o surgimento de superpragas (resistentes a herbicidas), o desaparecimento de espécies benéficas; e o aumento da utiliza??o de herbicidas.<br>  <br>  Em rela??o à saúde humana, o que se sabe por enquanto é que os transgênicos têm causado o aumento de casos de alergia, principalmente entre crian?as, além do aumento da resistência a antibióticos. Duas plantas transgênicas podem cruzar entre si e gerar um descendente n?o esperado ou previsto pelos cientistas. No Canadá, por exemplo, a canola transgênica Roundup Ready cruzou com a canola transgênica Liberty Link, o que resultou em uma canola supertransgênica. Além disso, as plantas transgênicas podem produzir substancias novas e desconhecidas, tóxicas ao homem.|`|517b5f06d3e9184303944e92e4bb0828aa	N?o sou especialista p/ falar, mas sei que n?o precisam de herbicidas p/ o cultivo.

A perspectiva de passar a ingerir vegetais geneticamente modificados despertou no imaginário das pessoas vagos fantasmas associados com a energia nuclear: uma tecnologia incompreensível, fora de controle público e capaz de p?r em circula??o amea?as invisíveis contra a saúde humana e o ambiente.<br>  <br>  Motivado sobretudo pela ignorancia sobre os fundamentos dessa tecnologia e pela surpresa desagradável de vê-la t?o perto do próprio corpo sem prévio aviso, o temor se difundiu rapidamente. Em quest?o de semanas, era assunto obrigatório nas reda??es de jornais e revistas, nos programas de televis?o e nas festas - em particular, jantares. O assunto foi dado como favas contadas no vestibular. Um estilista anunciou que criaria "roupas transgênicas". Até as histórias em quadrinhos, oráculos dos humores da sociedade, despertaram para o que parecia ser um desastre à espreita, como nestas tiras de Angeli e Laerte publicadas pela Folha de S.Paulo.<br>  <br>  Todo mundo queria saber: afinal, os transgênicos fazem mal ou n?o? Como quase sempre ocorre no mundo da ciência, n?o há uma resposta clara, muito menos definitiva, para essa pergunta. Por mais angustiante e urgente que ela seja, anos de debate ainda n?o foram suficientes para esclarecê-la. Este livro pode apenas ajudar os aflitos e interessados a localizar algumas das respostas parciais disponíveis, muitas vezes conflitantes, e a refletir sobre elas. Oxalá isso seja o bastante para que tirem suas próprias conclus?es.<br>  <br>  A única promessa do texto é tentar manter eqüidistancia dos extremos fundamentalistas --de um lado, a confian?a cega da indústria biotecnológica na seguran?a da engenharia genética; de outro, a desconfian?a alarmada e nem sempre bem informada da militancia verde. Sua única conclus?o: a querela dos transgênicos constitui provavelmente só o primeiro debate de uma longa série que a opini?o pública de qualquer país, desenvolvido ou n?o, terá de encarar, e nos quais a ciência será ingrediente fundamental. Os transgênicos ser?o apenas o aperitivo de uma dieta indigesta para quem n?o for capaz de acompanhar a marcha da tecnociência e, sobretudo, entender a revolu??o genética na biologia.<br>  <br>  O DEBATE PEGA FOGO<br>  <br>  A polêmica chegou ao Brasil com certo atraso, embora mais rápido do que --quem diria?-- aos Estados Unidos, onde só se tornou tema de debate na véspera do ano 2000. Enquanto isso, na Europa e na ásia, os transgênicos literalmente pegavam fogo, com militantes ambientalistas incendiando campos cultivados com variedades de organismos geneticamente modificados (os famigerados OGM), plantas 'engenheiradas' para se tornarem resistentes a insetos ou herbicidas. Em novembro de 1998, a associa??o de agricultores de Karnataka, um estado no sul da índia, lan?ou a campanha 'Opera??o Cremar a Monsanto', com o objetivo de arrancar e queimar pés de algod?o transgênico plantados - segundo eles, ilegalmente - em campos de teste (Monsanto é a empresa multinacional mais identificada com a tecnologia transgênica, embora n?o seja a única a empregá-la). No mês seguinte, a Euro-Toques, uma organiza??o que reúne mais de 2.500 gourmets da Europa, lan?ava um manifesto em que condenava a introdu??o de gêneros geneticamente alterados na cadeia alimentar, alegando que isso equivaleria a impor ao público um experimento genético de conseqüências t?o imprevisíveis quanto irreversíveis.<br>  <br>  Protestos e manifesta??es se sucediam com freqüência cada vez maior no continente europeu, traumatizado que estava com os escandalos alimentares da dioxina e da doen?a da vaca louca (encefalopatia espongiforme bovina, ou BSE, doen?a cerebral transmitida ao gado alimentado com carca?as de ovelhas contaminadas). N?o foi por acaso que a rea??o mais forte aos transgênicos desencadeou-se no país da BSE, o Reino Unido, em particular depois que o público britanico deu-se conta de que a soja - que entra como ingrediente num sem-número de comidas industrializadas, de salsichas a sorvetes - importada da ex-col?nia Estados Unidos vinha misturada com gr?os de plantas transgênicas. Diante da forte rea??o pública, a Uni?o Européia (que havia autorizado a importa??o e o processamento da soja transgênica em 1996) decidiu já em maio de 1998 introduzir regras para rotular alguns produtos que contivessem soja ou milho geneticamente alterados. Nos Estados Unidos, em contraste, culturas transgênicas já estavam aprovadas desde 1995, sem nenhuma imposi??o de rótulos ou segrega??o de produtos.<br>  <br>  No Brasil, desde junho de 1998 a Comiss?o Técnica Nacional de Biosseguran?a (CTNBio) examinava um pedido de licen?a da empresa Monsanto para comercializar a soja geneticamente modificada Roundup Ready, uma variedade resistente ao herbicida Roundup, da própria Monsanto (nome genérico: glifosato). Em 24 de setembro do mesmo ano, apesar de uma liminar que sustava o plantio, obtida pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do Consumidor (Idec) e pela organiza??o ambientalista Greenpeace, a CTNBio reiterou sua autoriza??o, deliberando que nada haveria a temer do ponto de vista da biosseguran?a e deixando outros aspectos de licenciamento a critério do Ministério da Agricultura. Era a primeira licen?a que a Comiss?o concedia para cultivo em escala comercial, mas já havia aprovado dezenas de outras para testes experimentais, normalmente realizados em áreas diminutas (da ordem de uns poucos hectares cada uma) e submetidos a severas medidas de seguran?a (como as faixas de seguran?a para evitar dispers?o de pólen e a queima de todos os pés após a colheita).<br>  <br>  Essa libera??o pioneira funcionou como estopim para uma saraivada de recursos e liminares. Nesse meio tempo, a guerra dos transgênicos já tinha desenvolvido até uma vers?o regional, farroupilha, com o novo governo petista do Rio Grande do Sul (administra??o Olívio Dutra) declarando o estado território livre de cultivares geneticamente modificados --uma decis?o distante da realidade, porque na prática o Rio Grande é a regi?o do Brasil onde mais se planta soja transgênica resistente ao glifosato, com recurso a sementes ilegalmente importadas da Argentina. Ao menos uma grande cadeia de varejo, o Carrefour, anunciou sua disposi??o de comprar exclusivamente soja n?o-transgênica. No Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia, saiu um ministro inteiramente favorável aos transgênicos, Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, e entrou um bem mais moderado, o diplomata Ronaldo Sardenberg, disposto a levar em conta a rea??o desfavorável de parcela do público.<br>  <br>  A semeadura da primeira safra de soja Roundup Ready foi adiada uma segunda vez, para desgosto da Monsanto. Também no caso dos transgênicos, e apesar dos esfor?os em contrário do governo federal, o Brasil se recusava a ser a Argentina de ontem, que aprovara a novidade da biotecnologia sem pestanejar e hoje conta com 80% de sua safra geneticamente modificada, mais que os Estados Unidos (55%) e o Canadá (10%).<br>  <br>  FRANKENSTEIN E AS BIOTECNOLOGIAS<br>  <br>  A desorienta??o do público persiste, assim como a indefini??o do Estado brasileiro sobre essa quest?o estratégica. Muita gente, perdida com o excesso e a novidade das informa??es, atira num mesmo saco de incertezas e temores frankensteinianos os alimentos transgênicos, clones de animais e seres humanos, técnicas desconcertantes de reprodu??o assistida e a manipula??o de embri?es e suas células em laboratório. N?o resta dúvida de que a confus?o auxilia os adversários dos OGM (o que n?o implica, como querem fazer crer seus partidários, que o exame imparcial e científico da matéria conduza única e necessariamente a sua aceita??o). Mesmo em setores esclarecidos da sociedade, parece predominar uma mentalidade algo paranóica em rela??o aos transgênicos, o que no final de contas pode revelar-se uma saudável forma de autodefesa diante do rolo compressor da indústria. Considere-se, por exemplo, o que escreveu o juiz federal Ant?nio Souza Prudente numa decis?o liminar proferida em junho de 1999, determinando que se realizasse estudo de impacto ambiental como precondi??o do plantio comercial da soja Roundup Ready:<br>  <br>  'Creio que a velocidade irresponsável que se pretende imprimir aos avan?os da engenharia genética, [...] guiada pela desregulamenta??o gananciosa da globaliza??o econ?mica, poderá gestar, nos albores do novo milênio, uma esquisita civiliza??o de 'aliens hospedeiros', com fisionomia pe?onhenta'.<br>  <br>  Preferências ideológicas e literárias à parte, a polêmica dos transgênicos ainda está por decidir-se. Os próximos quatro capítulos tentar?o lan?ar alguma luz sobre esse debate até agora mais acalorado do que esclarecedor, principiando por uma explica??o didática --objeto do Capítulo 1-- das bases da engenharia genética e de sua história, desde a descoberta da estrutura do DNA em 1953 e o surgimento da tecnologia do DNA recombinante em 1973, que já nasceu controvertida. O Capítulo 1 mostrará ao leitor que n?o procedem os argumentos, freqüentemente reiterados pela indústria e pelos cientistas partidários da biotecnologia, de que esta nada mais faria do que reproduzir em laboratório os rearranjos genéticos realizados há milênios, com auxílio de sele??o e cruzamentos, por melhoristas de plantas e animais. Abordará igualmente as rea??es do público aos organismos geneticamente modificados, em particular plantas cultivadas com fins alimentares (debates em nada comparáveis aos suscitados pelo emprego da mesma técnica na produ??o de drogas como insulina ou interferon, bem mais amenos). Ficará ent?o evidente que a engenharia genética sempre originou dúvidas e desconfian?a, mas também que estas sempre foram desconsideradas em nome do desenvolvimento tecnocientífico.<br>  <br>  O Capítulo 2 tratará das grandes incógnitas sobre os alimentos transgênicos, seus supostos efeitos danosos à saúde (toxicidade, alergias, dissemina??o da resistência a antibióticos) e ao ambiente (polui??o genética, surgimento de 'superervas' daninhas, mortandade de insetos benéficos). Sua leitura deixará claro que a discuss?o ainda está longe de terminar e que, provavelmente, seria sensato realizar estudos mais amplos antes de espalhar sem nenhum critério dúzias de variedades transgênicas pelo mundo.<br>  <br>  No penúltimo capítulo ser?o analisadas algumas quest?es relativas à ética, às políticas públicas e à legisla??o, como os direitos intelectuais (patentes) sobre sementes, em conflito com os direitos de agricultores tradicionais, e a relativa promiscuidade entre órg?os reguladores e a indústria. Sua mensagem central será a de que o Brasil --segundo maior produtor de soja do mundo-- pode extrair algumas vantagens do fato de ter se atrasado na regulamenta??o dessa matéria.<br>  <br>  No último capítulo, como mandam a lógica e o bom senso, virá a conclus?o --precária e provisória, além de muito mais genérica do que o leitor ávido por respostas preferiria encontrar: sim, as chamadas ciências da vida deveriam ser governadas por algo mais que a simples lógica científica e de mercado; mas, n?o, o teor médio de conhecimento ainda n?o é o suficiente para garantir uma interferência positiva e democrática nesse debate. Este livro pretende contribuir para alargar o conhecimento público de um tema que tem fundo técnico e científico, mas que cada vez mais se torna pré-requisito fundamental para a participa??o na vida política.<br>  <br>  Esta introdu??o comporta ainda alguns reconhecimentos imprescindíveis. Agrade?o a Lúcia Aleixo, Rodrigo Almeida, Joel Cohen, Goran Jezovsek, Marilena Lazzarini, Leila Oda e Elibio Rech as muitas oportunidades de aprofundamento na compreens?o da biotecnologia.

dpgXzMenaa	Yep... that's what orgasms *do*.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole (yes, your uterus *especially*, because it's mostly muscle and is *central* in all this) will squeeze and pulse a few times... maybe many times... while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	yes.  really deep orgasms cause both the uterus and the vagina to contract.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Yes when you have an orgasm, your vagina, anal area and uterus all have spasms for several seconds, and  you should be able to feel it, along with a tingly warm sensation throughout the lower tummy and vagina area.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	an orgasm is a series of contractions, so yes this is normal

FEAeTMnfaa	I think this might require professional help if your nephew is living with her.  Do you think he is in an unsafe situation?  If so, you need to get him out of there.<br>  <br>  Is your mom an alcoholic?  To deal with your relationship with her, you and your sister might look into Alanon meetings.   You could also see if there are any social work services in your area that can help you.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for your family's loss ... I hope you are able to get help for your mom.|`|XoDUTquWaa	If you have tried talking to her already and it hasn't helped I would go for the professional and soon. Not only is she killing herself but it sounds as if she is endangering your little sister also. And what about the little boy? Who is looking after him while she is in her alcohol stoopers and what about his mental health? He has lost a mother and a father already. Professional help I believe it is.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	this definately calls for professional help.<br>  contact anyone in the medical field.  she's a danger to your household and she needs help.|`|TfcxT0zTaa	I would sit down and talk about how you feel and if that does not help get help please

Why are you asking this?<br>  It is not weird or odd for two people who work out together to hang out after wards. Why would you think that?

Dehydration isn't fun.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Well,I go back to my apartment.<br>  I'm all sweaty and tired so I go to Subway,pick up a footlong go home,shower,eat,sleep.|`|JrrDtwVZaa	Depends on my mood, sometimes I might go out after and have a few brews. Other days just go back to my house and grab a protein shake.
KSUPtqCaaa	I don't think race or ethnicity has anything to do with the subject, frankly...<br>  <br>  That said, if you have sutures in place, you should be careful until about two weeks. It would be very bad if the wounds reopened and became infected, or you develop a dry socket.<br>  <br>  That said, you can very likely eat more solid foods. Rice is fine, as are beans and soft bread. Chicken should be fine, but avoid the thickly fried skins. I wouldn't go for ribs or such. Popsicles should be fine, too; unless the temperature causes discomfort.<br>  <br>  Honestly, when I had my wisdom teeth out, it was under local anesthetic only; and I had to work that night. I think I got Kung Pao chicken from the Chinese restaurant up the road from my job, lol... I just didn't chew with my back teeth.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I had mine pulled this past summer.<br>  I ate jello, pudding, ice cream, and cheesy grits (delicious!), as well as some other soft foods for the first 2 or 3 days.  After that, I ate mostly normal food, I just had to take smaller bites.  The worst part is that, because of your stitches and the scar tissue, you can't open your mouth all the way for weeks!!!  It gets better gradually,  but it was really hard to eat things like hot dogs!!  Actually, it was pretty amusing.  My friends all laughed at me.<br>  <br>  So, by your 4th or 5th day you should be able to eat whatever you want, just take small bites and chew closer to the front of your mouth!|`|7x9lvbhAaa	mac and cheese,soup,mushedpotato,ice cream,|`|3GHXk05saa	I lived on mashed potatoes and pudding for a week and a half, and not much of either.<br>  Maybe buttered noodles, yogurt, or really well cooked carrots or green beans?<br>  Frozen mac and cheese or other noodle dishes are usually pretty soft. Mama somebody, they're usually $1.|`|Afmv2WYSaa	pudding, applesauce, really soggy cereal|`|Wm1JL4ETaa	Soups or anythin soft.  Don't remember what I ate probably the same. Ice cream would be great.|`|1MBQqDETaa	I ate fried chicken and mac and cheese collard greens
cddd5cd90c0ecdfe5eb3c2995f593f4faa	Are you doing cardio at the gym?  That burns the badunkadunk off.<br>  Don't eat after 8pm, drink half your body weight in ounces of water p/day, use fat free spray butter instead of stick, nonstick spray instead of oil, 1% milk instead of whole, etc.  Add in fiber and eat 5 small meals instead of 3 large p/day.<br>  Largest meal breakfast, then medium for lunch, light for dinner so it doesn't stick to your body when you're least active.<br>  GL!|`|9oRgTCjKaa	You can lose that much weight in a week on the wu tea diet.
D8SpQAgLaa	Cayenne pepper works great. 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper in a glass of tomato juice, chug it down.<br>  B Vitamins work good also.|`|qeR967J7aa	First, can I recommend some sort of improved study habits... possibly a course.  Maybe, your course load is too high.  Your study hours are too long.<br>    As far as staying awake in class, try quiet fidgeting, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist, etc.  Also, participate in class.  That will keep you tuned in. If you're bored with the material, multitask. Try quietly doing some of that homework.  If you get sleepy before lunch, eat a snack earlier.  Your sugar levels could be low.  Most students forget how important a good diet is.  Good Luck!|`|8uXFDMEWaa	Eat regularly (healthy food, obviously). Drink cold water, splash cold water on your face. The advice of the person who posted above: things to keep you awake like rubber bands.<br>  <br>  Drinking coffee will only make you dependent on it, so I'm glad you don't want that kind of advice from anybody. <br>  <br>  Suggestions on staying up late: Get a schedule that works for you. I find it helps to go to the library after classes instead of doing homework at home. Then you can go home, eat, whatever other things you need to do, sleep. Have your fun on the weekends, but do school things during the week.
aNlT1NRqaa	Don't just diet to lose the weight. You may lose it, but you'll probably bounce back & gain more. It takes a lifestyle change.<br>  <br>  Don't drink soda, even diet. They are empty calories and actually bad for your teeth and bones.<br>  Drink tea, without sugar (1-2 cups per day) and water (8 glasses per day)<br>  Walk where you can, we tend to get lazy and drive. Walk to the grocery store (if it's within 2 miles) when you just need a few small things.<br>  One of the best & relatively cheap exercises is cycling. 1 hour on a bike will burn 750-1000 calories (3500 calories per pound) and it tones muscles while building endurance. So it will tighten up those legs for the dress.<br>  Even jumping rope can burn 500-700 calories per hour.<br>  <br>  Don't skip breakfast. Instead try to make breakfast the biggest meal of the day. It will satisfy you and keep you from wanting to snack. Steel cut oatmeal with raisins, craisins, dried peaches, etc. is very nutritious & will fill you up.<br>  Have a healthy lunch (no fast food).<br>  Dinner should be small. Who needs tons of calories to sleep?<br>  <br>  Some people need guidance, Weight Watchers seems to ba a good choice. My wife uses it and it's not a rip off like the people pushing miracle teas & berries. I didn't use it, but she loves it & they have good recipes (not prepackaged food - stuff you make).<br>  <br>  You'll be amazed at how much weight you lose. Just don't go back to any bad habits. It's much easier to gain instead of losing weight.<br>  <br>  Example: 1 Outback Bloomin' Onion has 2200 calories. That is 2-4 hours of heavy exercise, just to keep the same weight!<br>  <br>  Remember also, muscle weighs more than fat, so at some point you will level off (maybe gain 1-2 pounds), stay off the scale for a week when that happens & just look how your clothes fit.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Simple. In order to loose weight and keep it off... Lifestyle change.<br>  <br>  Burn more calories than you eat<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you.......|`|AicQ9LdEaa	I'm going to give it to you straight as a Personal Trainer.  Weight loss WITHOUT supplements is the best way to go.  Nothing works better on the body than NATURAL remedies.  You simply need to improve the quality of the food you eat, increase your level of activity even if it's just a daily walk around the block and reduce your total caloric intake each day.  You will hear all kinds of WONDER METHODS but if you want to take off the weight and KEEP it off while simultaneously keeping your body at optimal health and optimal performance then this is THE route to take.|`|jj3L6MDgaa	Okay, I'm not going to be like all the other people and just copy and paste the same answer into everyone's questions. You can't lose weight fast. I'm in the same situation as you are. I want to lose fast, but it simply isn't possible. Anorexia is not the way to go, because even if you do lose a lot, your metabolism will slow down shockingly and if you ever eat a medium-sized meal again, you can gain wait at an astounding rate. The best bet for someone who is going to be dedicated to getting fit is a structured program like Weight Watchers. Go to <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightwatchers.com</a> and try the free-trial. Hope I helped you out and I hope you make progress towards your goal!|`|1oBoDwxvaa	ithe thing i am currently doing at the moment is eating a lot of greens drinking a heap of water and having a good healthy dinner a small luch and only a bowl of cereal with half a glass of orange juice. plus doing sit up and crunches plus 100 mins sport on tuesdays at school xD Good luck!|`|zjNBxRU8aa	smoke rock
jlpQwPktaa	Having diarrhea a lot is something you should talk to the doctor about.  This is not normal and could be indicative of a serious illness.  <br>  <br>  Having diarrhea all the time IS life threatening.  Your body looses too much water and salt. Nutrients cannot be properly absorbed.|`|Ve6RAuq3aa	it will not go away by itself i assure you. i work at a pharmacy and ive heard some stories of ppl waiting before they treat hemorrhoids. Dont wait. get something from a pharmacy or drug store. lots of options to choose from. <br>  <br>  not much u can do apart from actually getting a cream from it. a hemorrhoid is where a vein in the anal region becomes inflammed and often breaks, creating bleeding, itching and general pain/discomfort. <br>  <br>  not life threatening but its gunna be a real pain in the **** (please excuse the pun) for a very long time

z5JkgFOyaa	Having irregular or missed periods can be caused by a number of things such as significant weight gain or loss (although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems), over-exercise, poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates), smoking, certain medications, caffeine, excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone), eating disorders, increased stress, PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome or estrogen dominance), uterine abnormalities such as fibroids, ovarian cysts, polyps, endometriosis and hormonal imbalances.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you consult with your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation to see what they think could be causing this if you have missed your period for more than two months.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	The best thing you can do is wait.  If you doctor was concerned she could have given you medication to start your period, so just be patient and it will start eventually.<br>  <br>  good luck..
FEAeTMnfaa	Light yogurts, 94% fat free popcorn, fruit, veggies, low-sugar granola bars, light ice cream bars (like Weight Watchers Smart Ones), fruit cups, unsweetened applesauce, high-fiber cereal (dry), vegetable soup, light cheese & whole grain crackers.  <br>  <br>  Find things you would normally like to snack on and then try to find a way to make it healthier.  For example, if you like pudding cups, you can eat pudding cups, just get some fat-free, sugar-free ones.|`|2HJYblAPaa	Fresh cut veggies. Drink plenty of water and watch the sugar intake.  I used to snack on yogurt but found that the amount of sugar is almost the same as eating a candy bar. Make sure you get lots of fiber also.|`|t5djNGJ0aa	Celery is excellent for that.

PVe6jK78aa	Marijuana was thought to kill brain cells after a study done in the 70's where rhesus monkeys were forced to smoke 4 joints a day for one year. After which the results showed minor brain cell damage.

If I were to do it all over again, I would make sure I used that saline nasal spray a few times a day after the operation.  I think that would prevent the stuffy nose part.|`|MtDMzSQjaa	3 days .. thats it!<br>  <br>  though even after that, you have to take proper care of yourself.
KOYC3XkJaa	It isn't water and it isn't pus either, unless your blister has gotten infected.<br>  It's serum and plasma (liquid component of your blood). Blisters form when there's damage to underlying skin layers and tissue but the top layer remains intact. So what happens is you have essentially a gap between layers of skin. Your immune system sends serum and plasma to the area to protect and cushion and allow for healing. The serum and plasma fill up the gap and in doing so push the top layer of skin outwards, creating a blister.<br>  So the liquid comes from your body and should stay in it. Blisters are your body's natural band-aids (so to speak) and should not be popped. Given time, your body will reabsorb the fluid and heal up all by itself. No blister breaking needed. Not to mention that breaking them is a great way to get an infection, they take longer to heal broken, and they sting quite a bit.|`|dnwGHBBdaa	its puss and its made up mostly off water though. but our bodies are made up of 70% water .... but i think it come from plasma in your blood.

And you have to have a mentor or some one who can guide you, help you, and monitor your progress as you dieting and do some aerobic exercises    <br>  <br>  It is a tall order but when there is a WILL there will be SUCCESS. <br>  Go ahead I know you can do it !
upvLAyyzaa	Going to therapy is not a sign of weakness.  It's actually a sign of strength because you are admitting to yourself that you have a problem and you are seeking help to solve it.  That's something many people can't do, then their lives fall apart.  Good luck!|`|AA11707163	IT SOUNDS LIKE IT MAY BE GOOD FOR YOU !|`|AA12383804	Needing help from someone else isn't weak, especially if you're admitting it. Everybody has problems and you shouldn't feel bad that yours are effecting your life. I think it's awesome that you're trying to fix things. Not everyone is bold enough to admit when they actually need help. I hope that you feel better about yourself!|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Going to therapy needs to only be for you.  If you do it for him, it won't work.  I know I tried.  Go to improve yourself.  Everything else will fall in place.|`|2rXITP7Yaa	You've hit on a key idea there - that you know you're viewing it in the wrong way.  It's ALL ABOUT how you view this - and in your case, it's not necessarily that you have a weakness - you could have no weakness at all in this area, and still decide to go to therapy anyway.  In the end, it's about bettering yourself.<br>  <br>  My advice - 'suck it up' and just go to one session.  Try and ensure you find someone good, via recommendations, ect.  You may be surprised at what comes out of this.  If you can't bring yourself to check out therapy on your own, enlist a good friend to talk to about this, or if you trust them enough, have them go with you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have nothing to lose here except an inhibiting fear.|`|QHBuH39jaa	Welcome to my world.  I went to my first counseling session last monday and am going again tomorrow.  I never thought I could do it and saw it as a weakness.  <br>  <br>  You just have to grab the phone and call and make the appointment.  Thats the hardest part.  I to am going because of my marriage.  My hubby has PTSD from the war and over the last six years since he has been home I have become angry and insecure, and my self esteem in down the tubes.<br>  <br>  Just do it for you, no one else.  If anything, tell yourself that you are going to validate what you already know.  I dunno, it took me years to decide to just do it.

DO NOT SHAVE there.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Yes, hair continues to grow, unless the follicles die, or the owner of the follicles dies.|`|Qas05nZraa	it grows back|`|mjDdy67Jaa	yes. did it before. i gave it a haircut every month|`|JMIKVR5waa	uhm yeah...<br>  keep it shaved hairy penis it gross|`|GiONso7zaa	yes the hair will grow back thicker than before|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yes it does grow|`|NTxx4gBNaa	your 'thing'?  you mean your PENIS?!?  it's just a word dude...<br>  <br>  anyway, yeah- it does grow back.  I trim (not shave, just trim short with a beard trimmer) it and eventually it'll all grow back like it was before.  Girls like it when it's trimmed.  It also helps keep you from being stinky down there.|`|62090c45c2dff067ee36d896ab2d47d4aa	Yes like most hair (unless your head is naturally bald) it does grow back it just takes time.|`|L5I2tXvVaa	of course it will its like hair on any other part it grows back|`|R2T8768Zaa	Lol, troll dude! <br>  <br>  And yes, it grows back.|`|PaPXlWwIaa	well duh it grows back|`|fCZO0LGcaa	Oh yeah!

Its just like when you shave your legs, no matter how many times you shave it, it will always grow back, usually thicker & faster.<br>  <br>  Sorry to scare you, but it's the truth.|`|C8pFxLDYaa	Yes. I suggest trimming. If you shave your hair follicles will turn red and be agitated for a bit. Your partner won't want you to have alot of hair down there.|`|LrnvYraKaa	If you cut your pubic hair it will grow back and it will be even bigger.|`|AMPuiA9Maa	ya it does and since you shaved it the hair will grow faster and thicker
Ve6RAuq3aa	not normal, pain when ur not actually touching ur glands usually means something is wrong...any chance you have been exposed to a person with glandular fever (epstein-barr virus) ?? this could include kissing, sharing cutlery, sharing drink bottles, etc. exposer could cause swollen glands. Sore throat or anything like that can also indicate a viral infection like epstein-barr. u should definately see a doctor<br>  <br>  the pimple is probably unrealated, depends on just how big it is. if u are still calling it a pimple then it sounds okay. if it gets so big that its obviously not a pimple then definately talk to a doctor about this.

You will start to bleed and may pass large clots or pieces of tissue. It will hurt.

However, if you don't go to the ER you should call your OB/GYN ASAP so that he or she can see you quickly enough to make sure the baby is OK.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	It doubtful the test missed anything.  If you have recurrent SVT it's an AV Node issue and no amount of tests will diagnose that just the recurrent SVT that's documented/picked up by a holter monitor.  Frankly it sounds like you have a panic disorder regardless you should consider seeking treatment for that so you won't continue to be debilitated by it and can try to live as normal of a life as possible.

Sex makes babies, and if you don't want babies get her on birth control. Go to the Planned Parenthood website and learn about it.<br>  <br>  Sex is NOT something to just do without knowing how to do it. You need to learn how to protect yourselves first.

Optimum nutrition is a good brand.|`|AicQ9LdEaa	Contrary to popular belief, unless you are an athlete and training hours a day then a well balanced diet will provide more than enough protein for anyone doing a normal work out.  It's all because of a lot of hype and marketing that the general public thinks that they have to use these products to build good solid, lean muscle mass.  This is simply not true.  However, if you ARE a serious athlete then the best time to take the supplements is immediately after the workout because it's during the reconstructive phase that your body needs the additional protein.  As to which kind to use, it doesn't matter as long as they contain good quality whey proteins.  I use a product called Muscle Milk.  It's a little high in fat but it's a specially engineered fat that burns up as energy instead of being stored in the body.|`|jj3L6MDgaa	Protein shakes are better and I suggest making your own. Get a bucket of Whey Protein and put in the blender along with some frozen fruit (berry, tropical, etc. they sell bags of them in the frozen food aisle) and some ice.

z5JkgFOyaa	There is quite a bit of variation in how long it takes for a girl to establish the regular menstrual cycle that most women experience in adulthood. And even after the menstrual cycle matures and becomes regular, this "regularity" may differ greatly from woman to woman. This irregularity can give you a concern because you feel there is something wrong going on.<br>  <br>  So, some understanding about the normal variations that occur in early adolescence and young adulthood can help ease some of the anxiety. <br>  <br>  The cycles in the early years after menstruation has begun typically are a few days longer than in adults. In addition, the lengths of time for irregularity may commonly be longer in these first couple of years.<br>  <br>  During the first two years after a girl begins having periods, up to 50% of the cycles occur without ovulation. By about 5 years after the onset of menses, 80% of the cycles have ovulation occurring within them. Without ovulation, the timing of menstrual cycles is not too predictable which is why periods are so variable during the first two years after they have begun. <br>  <br>  There are other reasons why a girl could go for an extended period of time without a period. However, you can see that it is quite normal for a girl to have somewhat irregular periods during the first two years of menses. Barring concern for pregnancy or other health problems that could be a factor in not menstruating, many doctors wait until two periods have been missed before doing any significant evaluation for causes.<br>  <br>  The most common causes for missed periods in teenagers are pregnancy, stress, and a condition called polycystic ovaries. I would suggest that you talk to your Mum about this and have her call your doctor to discuss this matter in order that he/she may decide whether or not it is necessary to make an appointment. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|udpdCqQ2aa	For the first two years ur period is going to be irregular..we all go thru it dnt worry<br>  <br>  vote me as best! :)|`|eHn708pDaa	Periods are very irregular for the first few years.

Since it's a pretty large object, you may need some lubrication, and if it starts hurting worse adjust the angle you're pulling at; You wouldn't want to get any sort of injuries in there.  When it is out (be patient, it may take a while) be sure to wash your vagina very well.  I'd suggest making a run to the store and finding a soap for that purpose, but if not a gentle antibacterial or lemon juice will work.  Lemon juice will sting though.  I'd also recommend that you see a doctor or gynecologist after you get it out.  And hon, if you're serious, just buy a vibrator.|`|AVqV2Q9waa	well if it not that far up take a butter knife and put it in there past the bottle and then move it and pull down intill it comes out or push really hard like your having a baby if that don't work see a doctor immediatly. wtf were u doin putting that in there thats what they make toys for...umm also next time try lubricating it with ky or something alot whatever object it may be so it gets slippery and isnt likely to get stuck.|`|BcWs38MWaa	hahahaha i dont believe u what part of the ketcup botthe ? is it the stick or the other part and how deep in it is it maybe try some baby oil and put it around ur vagina and them circle it hope that gets it out or else u will have to go to er|`|wkyNWtfAaa	why do you want to take it out? your babby is drinking ketchup and won't let go of the bottle. try slipping some xanax into it that will knock babby right out!|`|7uRFHWxkaa	Try taking a warm bath to relax your muscles and gently tug at the bottle a bit until it is free.

In the last ten years, women suddenly think they are better off with no pubic hair.  The hair is so thick that it causes itchy and scratchy stubble, like on your legs but worse.  Waxing doesn't create this stubble.  However, in my opinion, and I have tried it, it's totally unnecessary and a waste of time.  If you have excessive hair, just trim it a little so it doesn't stick through your undies or bathing suit, and let it go.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|JIGTZyUnaa	It's completely up to you whether or not you shave your pubic hair.. some girls like to be "bare" down there, some like it trimmed a little, and some don't mind all the hair. It's completely your preference, but if you do shave make sure you use moisturizer and shaving cream so that you don't dry out your skin and get razor burn because the skin down there is much more sensitive than that of your legs..|`|ETiITRdoaa	only if you want to most women do but if your european or something dont that like against there religion or something|`|ZOJuDnZmaa	You  don't have to shave if you don't want to.

No matter what anyone says, it is not up to your boyfriend/partner in any way. If shaving makes you feel sexy and comfortable, then go for it. If a bush makes you confident and sexy, then keep it. This is a decision you have to make for yourself. If whoever your with doesn't like your decision, then find someone who likes it. Just because your a woman does not mean you need to shave your pubic hairs. Think about this and decide what you want to do. Also, you could shave it all off, and if you don't like it then let your bush grow back. There is nothing wrong with trying new things.|`|JQAVZuqpaa	whichever you feel more comfortable with. i think shaving is better and it is just cleaner and more comfortable but it doesn't really matter.|`|RWhdtG33aa	It's a personal choice girl.But hygienically yes its better if u trim it atleast.

You cannot get AIDS by having sex with a partner that does not have it.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

o1d673xLaa	It sounds like tonsillitis or strep throat or something similar.  These all produce pus on your tonsils.  So don't worry, it's completely normal (although very painful!).  I was going to suggest seeing the doctor again but since you are going to the specialist he/she should be able to diagnose it very quickly.  Hope it gets better soon!|`|YB3ULPPeaa	Kiddo, you can't see your tonsils when you open your mouth. Those two tiny holes are openings to your salivary glands (I think) and when you have infection they leak white pus. I don't know what is up with the white skin, but it sounds like you need to go back to the doc. You may have mono or something. Being that your a football player, that may be the reason you are not healing. Try to gargle with warm salt water at least six times a day to make your throat feel better. AND... stay out of the weather for at least three days. I am getting over the flu myself and still have drainage and laryngitis. So, I know what your talking about :)|`|YAplkfZgaa	Get them out then.

GtBOQPKqaa	It could be something as simple as wearing glasses, though I doubt it.<br>  <br>  You need to follow what you said: see a doctor (go to the ER if you must). They can perform a CT scan or even an MRI to determine the cause. If there's a tumor there, then it would help explain what you're experiencing.|`|q2cuRzaKaa	You don't have health insurance? You need an MRI. Getting insurance should be high on your list of priorities. Your list of symptoms is too vague to classify accordingly - do you also experience nausea? Dizziness? If so, then the underlying problem can be in your eye and is called Asthenopia. Do you have swollen feet or hands? Then it can be Borries syndrome. <br>  <br>  The point: It can be a thousand different things based on the symptoms you've listed. If you can provide any further information I will gladly help you in determining what you have - or lack thereof.
11N5NSAqaa	try to not think so much about it.  i know there's always a fear of the unknown, but getting yourself worked up about it won't make it any better.  first things first, before anything happens PLEASE make sure you have some kind of protection- make sure he has a condom, or maybe you're on birth control.  knowing that you are doing it responsibly will alleviate some of the stress about your first time.  remember: in the event that the condom breaks or some other problem comes along, Plan B (or 'the morning after pill') is sold over the counter at almost all drugstores. <br>       you are correct that there will be some bleeding.  don't worry, it won't be like having a period.  it's going to be minimal and you may not even notice it because it will get mixed in with the other fluids that are happening down there.  bleeding also depends on intensity of your boyfriend...if you are considering having sex you should be able to talk to him about being gentle with you and not being too rough.  <br>       you are also going to be tight...this is normal obviously and it will cause minimal discomfort.  as your boyfriend's motion becomes repetitive, you will begin to loosen up and it will begin to hurt less.  try to remain calm and don't tense up because that will only make it worse.  the most painful part (at least for me) was the next day--it hurt to sit down.  but that too is temporary and could probably be relieved by taking tylenol or something of the sort. <br>       most importantly, your boyfriend should love you enough to understand and guide you through any concerns you may have.  maybe try and talk to him, you could even make the conversation playful and sort of naughty so you get him excited.  it will bring you guys closer and make the experience that much better!!<br>  <br>  best of luck!!|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It sounds like you really need someone to talk to that can give you some honest answers and not skirt around the truth.  You can email me through my profile if you want and I will help with any questions you have.<br>  <br>  First, don't do anything you are not ready to do even if he wants you to.  You can expect some pain and maybe some bleeding, but the pain is not excruciating and the bleeding is not excessive.  You may be sore in your pelvic area muscles and have some spotting from your hymen for a couple of days.  It may work to your advantage that he is experienced so he won't rush you, will take his time and use lube so you are wet.  Most of the time, your first experience is not great, so don't worry about things like orgasm until you get more experience.  <br>  <br>  have fun..|`|IWMAm959aa	two words..pain and bleeding. at least thats what it was with me lol but dont worry, after your first time, it gets GOOD ;D|`|Eec9JeXbaa	the bleeding depends... I never bled..<br>  <br>  One think I have to say is to make sure you and your boyfriend have long foreplay. Just enjoy each others touches etc before you go for the intercourse. Don't worry, as long as you are relaxed and eased about what you're doing, you'll be absolutely fine.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel ready when he's about to enter, just stop him and do more foreplay, just talk, touch, kiss whatever makes you feel good.<br>  <br>  Experience doesn't come into it. It's all about enjoying yourself and you'll go with the flow...<br>  If he wants you to do something that makes him feel good, its fine, don't feel bad about it, because you didn't think of it yourself. That's the pleasure of couple being intimate.<br>  You both should talk about what feels good during sex so you can find out how to please each other.|`|kzmvzTeEaa	I asked the Same question a while ago.. I had the same problem... I asked people on yahoo and this is what they say(it was accurate!!) Good luck!!<br>  <br>  It depends on what type of expeirience you and ya bf make of it. Ofcourse it'll hurt a bit as he breaks his way through your hymen but its not like giving birth or anything like that. Its's not like the movies neither,all sensual and perfect. Sex can have it's moments like sometimes it comes with funny sounds(vaginas make farting noises when air is blocked inside) but thats sometimes. And if he's on top sometimes it can take him a few seconds before he finds the right hole so dont be surprised if ya butthole gets a short visit (lol). But after a while you get used to certain positions and you'll stretch out to accomadate the size of his "stuff" and it can be a nice beautiful expeirience but sucks once you gotta start going to the gyn and all that crap. Just be safe and use protection always<br>  <br>  <br>  Relax. But expect pain and for you to have a hard time walking after sex. It is never pleasurable after the first few tries. After the first few tries and when "his" gets in more easily in "yours", make sure to explore the different positions afterwards, that way you won't be disappointed on why he's not giving you pleasure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Expect a pain there like a cramp in your stomach but not in your stomach.<br>  You may feel a bit sick from this pain.<br>  Also bleeding.<br>  Tell him to go slow and be gentle. If it hurts a bit to much to begin with tell him to stop and then do some foreplay and try again.<br>  Just get to know each others bodies a bit more.<br>  Also you might be a bit sore down there for a while.<br>  It will go.<br>  Promise.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most girls don't feel pleasure for their first time(s).<br>  But some girls do.<br>  Before he puts his penis in you make sure you are loose enough.<br>  Let him finger you first.<br>  Try 2 fingers, it will make it not hurt so much.<br>  Um yeah?<br>  Oh and don't go on top at first because being on top hurts more for the girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  use condoms, be relaxed.|`|wol6ECnQaa	If your hymen has already broken due to other activities that can break it (like rigorous biking, swimming, and exercise) then you shouldn't bleed. It's only when the hymen rips for the first time that you will bleed. A few table spoons of blood +/- you can expect.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to be well lubricated before penetration and to take your time. Make sure he eases himself in you and not just jam it in. If you have to guide him, then do so. Don't make him go too excited because he might go too rough on you which will bring you more pain.<br>  <br>  And another thing, have him wear a condom! Even if your on the pill. Better safe than sorry.<br>  Make sure to think about this clearly before going on your first time because this is a gift that can only be given once. Once you give that gift no one else for the rest of your life can be that close. it sounds sad but it is true.|`|xXiCghR4aa	Don't worry. A lot of girls feel the same way. You might experience pain and discomfort during your first time due to a membrane at the opening of your vagina called a hymen. It usually breaks during your first time especially if you've never pleasured yourself or used a tampon, however this doesn't mean you'll be in pain. <br>  <br>  Your hymen could have broken when you were a child from playing, falling down, or riding a horse or bike. Some people don't feel any pain their first time, myself included, but I masturbated before I had sex. <br>  <br>  Anything is possible.<br>  <br>  Also the thickness of your hymen also mirrors how much you may or may not bleed. Thicker hymens lead to more bleeding and more painful penetration, but thinner ones are less painful and bleed less. There's never large quantities of blood. <br>  <br>  Also make sure your boyfriend knows that you're a virgin. I know it might be embarrassing but he will be more inclined to be easy on you if you explain your concerns. If you don't tell him he might try to go deeper or too fast and that could hurt you too. Make sure he knew to go slow until you know whether or not it hurts too badly. Don't feel ashamed of yourself if you bleed either. It happens to almost every girl and if he's serious about you, he'll understand. <br>  <br>  Lastly, don't be scared. If sex wasn't so awesome in the first place no one would have it if it hurt so bad the first time. Even if there is a little bit of discomfort, if you have a good partner, that pain at the beginning will be well worth it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RWhdtG33aa	Try checking google to if u can find out something helpful. But as u said that ur BF n u r serious then he shud appreciate the fact that u are a virgin & he shud make u feel comfortable, dont worry evey1 learns thru experience.

There is a very very very slim possiblity but one of you would have to be SUPER SUPER fertile to get pregnant from the sperm on a fingertip.  Unless his finger went way way up there it's probably not likely at all.  The penis gets right up close to your cervix when it ejactulates (usually) which pushes all the spermies into the uterus.  Any sperm that were on the finger probably didn't live anyway, they don't do well outside of the male or female body (and in intercourse where the man ejactulates, most of the sperm die on the way to the uterus anyway).  It is possible to get pregnant even if the penis isn't right up next to the cervix, but since a penis wasn't even close to your cervix I would say you're safe.  Maybe you got stressed out, worried that you could be pregnant, stress can DEFINITELY cause a period to be late.  Maybe all the hormones that got excited from your intimate encounter set off your rhythm.  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|AA12086008	yes.|`|d8f55876885a56e33de3ab12cbef49f9aa	no ,never it is not possible .so not be afraid.and enjoy|`|fa538899208a36a5e99ad0873a8b05ebaa	YES IF THE GUY WAS MASTURBATING AND THEN TOUCHES YOU YES IT IS A POSSIBILITY.
9aed608586b95196d3f231567f3b182caa	Weight lifting in-and-of-itself has no effect on the ultimate height of an adolescent.  There are some skeletal changes which can take place (all are minor and reverse once the body catches up in all forms), such as a prominent bump on the lower leg bone, just below the knee.<br>  What CAN affect the ultimate height of an adolescent trying to gain muscle mass is steroids.  Sex hormones (testosterone if you utilize steroids) cause the areas of the bone where length-wise growth takes place to become inactive.  So, if an adolescent tries to help their muscle growth by taking steroids, it can cause fusion of the "epiphiseal growth plate" thust halting longitudinal growth.|`|AA11408260	as long as they stick to the right forms of training there is no problem|`|518a1c45b661d71113522f75cc06842baa	no but they shouldn't lift too much|`|AA11354519	lol no it won't stunt your growth.

Das Herz fungiert dabei als Antriebsmotor, der das Blut mit Druck durch die Adern pumpt und so in Bewegung h?lt. Normalerweise arbeitet das Herz in einem regelm??igen Rhythmus von 60 bis 80 Schl?gen pro Minute. <br>    <br>  Die H?he des Blutdrucks ist von der St?rke der Herzt?tigkeit abh?ngig und von der Muskelspannung in den W?nden der Adern. Je h?her diese Wandspannung ist, desto enger sind die Adern und desto h?her ist der Blutdruck. Den Blutdruck in der Schlagader kann man mit aufblasbaren Manschetten, die an Druckmessger?te angeschlossen sind, am Oberarm oder am Handgelenk bestimmen. <br>  Der Blutdruck wird in 2 Werten angegeben<br>  <br>  Der h?here, systolische Wert gibt den Druck an, der beim Zusammenziehen des Herzens entsteht, wenn das Blut in die Schlagadern gepumpt wird.<br>  Der niedrigere, diastolische Wert gibt den Druck zwischen zwei Herzschl?gen an, wenn das Herz nach dem Pumpvorgang erschlafft und sich wieder mit Blut füllt. In dieser Ruhephase ist der Druck in den Adern niedriger.<br>  Wird bei einem gesunden Erwachsenen der Blutdruck in Ruhe gemessen, sollte der h?here, systolische Wert etwa bei 120mmHg und der niedrigere, diastolische Wert bei etwa 80mmHg liegen. <br>  Wenn das Blut unter Hochdruck steht<br>  <br>  Blutdruckschwankungen im Tagesverlauf sind ganz normal, denn der Druck in den Adern passt sich den jeweiligen Aktivit?ten an. Bei k?rperlicher Anstrengung, wenn Muskeln und Organe st?rker mit Blut versorgt werden müssen, oder bei Aufregung schl?gt das Herz schneller, und der Blutdruck steigt.<br>  Darüber hinaus unterliegt der Blutdruck auch einem natürlichen Tagesrhythmus. Am frühen Vormittag und am sp?ten Nachmittag ist er am h?chsten. Nachts ist er am niedrigsten. <br>    <br>  <br>  Wann ist der Blutdruck krankhaft erh?ht?<br>  <br>  <br>  Normaler Blutdruck<br>  <br>  Nach neuesten Erkenntnissen sollte der Blutdruck optimalerweise im Ruhezustand unter 120/80 mmHg liegen. Allerdings werden Werte zwischen 120/80 und 129/84 mmHg ebenfalls als ideal angesehen. <br>  Hoch-Normaler Blutdruck<br>  <br>  Liegen die Ruhewerte zwischen 130/85 und 139/89 mmHg spricht man von hoch-normalen Werten. Wenn keine weiteren Erkrankungen vorliegen, ist das nicht so schlimm. Allerdings sollte der Blutdruck dann in regelm??igen Abst?nden kontrolliert werden. Bei einem Diabetes mellitus (Zuckerkrankheit) oder bei einem schwachen Herzen kann der Arzt schon bei hoch-normalen Werten ein blutdrucksenkendes Medikament verschreiben. <br>  Bluthochdruck (Hypertonie)<br>  <br>  Wenn die Grenze des normalen Blutdrucks von 140/90 mmHg in Ruhe auf Dauer überschritten wird, spricht man von Bluthochdruck oder arterieller Hypertonie. <br>    <br>  <br>  Bin ich allein?<br>  <br>  Der Bluthochdruck ist die h?ufigste Erkrankung in den Industriel?ndern.

Frau wissen nichts darüber. <br>  Jeder 4. Betroffene verzichtet auf die Behandlung. <br>  Das Tückische am Bluthochdruck ist, dass er im Anfangsstadium im Allgemeinen keine Beschwerden verursacht. Gelegentlich kommt es zu Kopfschmerzen oder Müdigkeit, was man jedoch auch auf andere Ursachen zurückführen kann. So wird der Bluthochdruck meist zuf?llig bei einem Arztbesuch entdeckt. Gerade die frühzeitige Erkennung und eine anschlie?ende konsequente Behandlung des Bluthochdrucks sind jedoch sehr wichtig, um sich vor Folgeerkrankungen und Sch?den an den Organen zu schützen.|`|2dacf5e8f68700a15d9799e73a9247bcaa	Diese Frage sollte Dir am besten Dein Hausarzt  beantworten, denn der kennt Deinen allgemeinen Gesundheitszustand und was gerade speziell bei Dir zu beachten ist!<br>  <br>  Natürlich gibt es allgemeine Faustregeln:<br>  der untere Wert gut unter 100, der obere Wert bei jungen Leuten 100+Alter und ansonsten nicht über ca. 140.

60e687a1022a8549cc7b3d2d3d7cabafaa	I have 3 bulging disks in my low back and 2 herniated in my neck...the treatments can be either, going to the chiropractor,pain medications and surgery or all of these at once.Bulging disks will eventually get worse and either become herniated or degenerated.All doctors use the terms of bulging ,herniated and degeneration differently,I have come to find out.Some doctors say that bulging and herniated are the same,and some say that disk degeneration is hairline cracks in the disk.I have researched these terms and this is how I define them along with other doctors,bulging is where the rubbery material between the vertebrae have been pushed out by bending improperly,coughing hard or sitting for long periods of time,herniated is where the rubbery material has torn open and is leaking into your body,it usually starts out as a bulging disk or can happen from any type of injury to the back,degeneration is where you have cracks in the vertebrae and bulging disks can push the vertebrae to the point where they touch each other and pressure from standing can cause them to have hairline cracks.Al of these are terribly pain full.The treatment is more invasive if you wait until things get worse.I currently take pain medication and I'm waiting to get my disk replacement surgery.I will have either a plastic disk or they will use part of my hip bone to replace the broken and damaged disks and vertebrae.It's totally up to you when you have treatment done,most people try to go to the chiropractor but it causes more pain so they stop going,that's what I did.It made things worse.Make sure to get second and third opinions when it comes to surgery,other doctors may have better options and the newest forms of treatment.Good luck!!You are going to have a long road ahead of you to getting any relief.Remember,most pain medications are addictive!I am addicted to pain meds. now because of this type of injury!|`|9439577287c89721deb85e4735b6ccefaa	Take it easy, pray it heals on its on.

b1f833fbeb8f8dde93981f06e0dc7ab0aa	Narzissmus ist eine Charaktereigenschaft, die sich durch ein geringes Selbstwertgefühl bei gleichzeitig übertriebener Einsch?tzung der eigenen Wichtigkeit und dem gro?en Wunsch nach Bewunderung auszeichnet.<br>  Narzissmus ist ein geschichtetes Deutungsmuster, das auf vielf?ltige miteinander verbundene Erscheinungen verweist. Diese Erscheinungen sind zugleich auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen für alle Betroffenen wirksam, wenn auch in unterschiedlichem Ma?e. Sie werden jedoch nicht immer bewusst wahrgenommen und selten miteinander in Beziehung gesetzt, da die Erkenntnis dieses Ph?nomens von den Betroffenen als Narzisstische Kr?nkung empfunden wird. Man meidet die geistige Auseinandersetzung mit diesem anscheinbar unergründlichen Ph?nomen, weil sie zu einer Selbsterkenntnis führt, die nicht leicht zu verkraften ist.<br>  Auf der mythologischen Ebene ist Narziss ein Knabe, der sich in sein Spiegelbild verliebt. Da er das Spiegelbild nicht fassen kann, verzweifelt er an der Suche nach Identit?t. Es ist der Mythos der Identit?tssuche. Eine Suche, die letztlich ohne Erfolg bleiben muss, denn wer wei? schon, wer er ?wirklich“ ist.<br>  Im Alltagsverst?ndnis ist ein Narzisst ein Mensch, der sich mehr auf sich selbst bezieht und dabei andere (Mensch, Natur usw.) vernachl?ssigt. Bedingt also ein Egoist.<br>  Manche Menschen haben in ihrer frühkindlichen Entwicklung weniger Liebe von Bezugspersonen als andere erhalten, sie leiden oft lebenslang darunter und geben ihre Reaktionen auf ihre Entbehrungen an andere weiter. Dies muss aber nicht zwangsl?ufig zu einer narzisstischen Erkrankung führen. Sie reagieren mit Verhaltensweisen, die von der Psychologie als narzisstische Charakterst?rungen eingeordnet werden. Diese psychologische Deutung versteht den Narzissmus als ein Leiden, weil die Betroffenen Schwierigkeiten haben, Objektbeziehungen zu führen. Sie versuchen ihr Gegenüber zu kontrollieren und suchen nach st?ndiger Best?tigung ihrer Grandiosit?t, da sie sich ohne diese leer fühlen.<br>  Auf der kulturellen Ebene werden in der narzisstischen Gesellschaft Werte des Eigennutz propagiert unter Vernachl?ssigung von Werten des Gemeinnutzes. Das macht ein Anpassen an diese Werte (z.B. Geiz ist geil) einfach. Die in dieser narzisstischen Kultur lebenden Menschen brauchen eine willentliche Entscheidung oder alternative Vorbilder, um nach Werten zu handeln, die nicht im gesellschaftlichen Mainstream liegen. Sie müssen dann oft auf Privilegien verzichten.<br>  Auf der spirituellen Ebene ist ein Narzisst ein Mensch, der den Kontakt zum Sein verloren hat. Dieser Mensch ist in seiner oder ihrer narzisstischen Pers?nlichkeitsstruktur wie in einem Gef?ngnis eingesperrt. Das Gef?ngnis wird jedoch oft erst dann offensichtlich, wenn die Sehnsucht nach dem ?Sinn des Lebens“, nach dem ?eigentlichen“ und nach dem ?Glück“ nicht verstummen will.<br>  Umgangssprachlich heften dem Wort ?Narzissmus“ nur negative Bedeutungen an. Alice Miller sieht den Begriff hingegen als Eigenschaft, wie sie es unter anderem in Das Drama des Begabten Kindes erl?utert. Narzisstisch zu sein ist für sie etwas normales, gesundes und meint jemanden, der seine Interessen verfolgen kann. Eine narzisstische St?rung entsteht laut Miller, wenn ein Kind seine eigenen Gefühle und Interessen nicht artikulieren durfte und sp?ter dafür ein ?Ventil“ braucht. Das ?u?ert sich meistens in Depression und/oder Gefühlen der Gro?artigkeit, die aber nur zwei Seiten der selben Medaille darstellen.<br>  In der Psychiatrie und der Psychologie findet der Narzissmus Ausdruck in der so genannten narzisstischen Pers?nlichkeitsst?rung, die aber klar abzugrenzen ist von der allgemeinsprachlichen Verwendung des Begriffs Narzissmus als 'Selbstverliebtheit'.<br>  Narzisstische Personen sind gekennzeichnet durch einen Mangel an Einfühlungsverm?gen und überempfindlichkeit gegenüber Kritik, welches sie mit einem gro?artigen ?u?eren Erscheinungsbild zu kompensieren versuchen. H?ufig h?ngt das mit ihrem brüchigen Selbstwertgefühl zusammen. Sie besitzen aber auch einen Blick für das Besondere, k?nnen leistungsstark (in Schule, Beruf, Hobby) sein und haben oft gepflegte und statusbewusste Umgangsformen. Neben Pr?dispositionierung ist das Elternhaus ein entscheidender Faktor für narzisstische Pers?nlichkeiten. Es finden sich überwiegend sehr unempathische, wenig akzeptierende Eltern, die das Kind nicht selten schon früh überfordern. So findet in der kindlichen Erziehung vor allem ein Verhalten Beachtung und Verst?rkung, das in gewisser Intoleranz gegenüber anderen (Menschen) die eigenen F?higkeiten und Wertigkeit betont und diese auch nach au?en gut darstellen kann, und zwar ohne dass das tats?chlich gezeigte Verhalten dieser Selbstpr?sentation auch nur ann?hernd entsprechen muss.<br>  Maligner Narzissmus kann als Zwischenstufe von narzisstischer und antisozialer Pers?nlichkeitsst?rung angesehen werden. Als maligner (= b?sartiger) Narzissmus wird die Kombination von narzisstischer Pers?nlichkeitsstruktur, antisozialen Verhaltensweisen mit intensiven krankhaften Aggressionen und eventuellen paranoiden Neigungen bezeichnet. Kennzeichnend sind krankhafte Grandiosit?t bis hin zu Sadismus und Hass. Im Unterschied zur antisozialen Pers?nlichkeitsst?rung, welche sich durch das v?llige Fehlen von Schuldgefühlen und Gewissen und Sorge/Mitgefühl sich selbst und andere Menschen betreffend auszeichnet, sind jedoch beim malignen Narzissmus noch über-Ich Anteile funktionsf?hig und es exisitiert auch ein Gefühl für Mitmenschen, wenn auch oft in ausbeuterischem Interesse.<br>  Jeder Mensch durchl?uft narzisstische Zust?nde. Nach Sigmund Freud unterscheidet man den prim?ren und sekund?ren Narzissmus. Beim prim?ren Narzissmus richtet das Kleinkind seine sexuelle Energie (Libido) ganz auf sich selbst. Beim sekund?ren Narzissmus wird die sexuelle Energie von ?u?eren Objekten wieder abgezogen und auf sich selbst bezogen (Regression). Dieser Zustand trete vor allem nach entt?uschter Liebe oder Selbstwertkr?nkungen auf.<br>  Erich Fromm bezeichnet Narzissmus als Gegenpol zur Liebe und unterscheidet neben dem Narzissmus des Einzelnen auch den Gruppennarzissmus (siehe Patriotismus bzw. Fanatismus).<br>  Heute bezeichnet der Begriff Narzissmus innerhalb der psychoanalytischen Theorie nicht nur eine krankhafte Bezogenheit auf sich selbst, sondern ist auch Ausdruck eines gesunden Selbstwertes. Vor allem die selbstpsychologische Schule (innerhalb der Psychoanalyse) von Heinz Kohut hat diesen Wechsel in der Bewertung des Narzissmus als bedeutendes Modell für die psychische Gesundheit eingeleitet. So bezeichnet der Narzissmus ein System von Libidobesetzungen. Hier werden allerdings nicht Objekte wie die eigenen Eltern oder ein Liebespartner libidin?s besetzt, sondern eine eigene innerpsychische Instanz. Diese Instanz wird sowohl von Kohut als auch von Kernberg das Selbst genannt. Kohut versteht darunter ein von Beginn an vorhandenes psychisches System, welches dem gesamten psychischen Apparat als auch dem K?rper ein Gefühl der Einheit und Zusammengeh?rigkeit verleiht. Die Besetzung mit psychischer Energie (Libido) dieses Selbstes wird von Kohut als Narzissmus angesehen. Diese Besetzung kann pathologische Züge annehmen, wenn die Instanz des Selbst aus verschiedenen Gründen nicht gesund entwickelt ist. Eine gro?e Rolle spielt hierbei die frühe Beziehung zwischen Kind und Bezugsperson. Wenn die Bezugsperson dem S?ugling nicht genügend Einfühlungsverm?gen und Best?tigung entgegenbringt, kann es zu einer Fehlentwicklung kommen. So kommt es zu den Erscheinungsformen von pathologischem Narzissmus.<br>  Kernberg sieht den Narzissmus ebenfalls mit dem Selbst verbunden (im Gegensatz zu Freud, der noch kein Selbst kannte, und im Narzissmus die Besetzung des Ichs sah). Für Kernberg ist das Selbst ein Teil des Ichs. Dieses Selbst ist ein Resultat aus den frühen Objektbeziehungen. Kommt es zu St?rungen in der miteinander verknüpften Entwicklung von frühen Objektbeziehungen und Selbst, kann dies zu dem beschriebenen pathologischen Narzissmus führen. Auch hier spielt die erste Bezugsperson eine ?hnliche Rolle.<br>  In der psychoanalytischen Theorie wird nicht nur die Pers?nlichkeitsst?rung aus einer narzisstischen St?rung abgeleitet. Auch Depression, Suizidalit?t, Aggression, Dissoziation, Autoaggression und Hyperaktivit?t geh?ren zu den narzisstischen St?rungen|`|73a265993185737c282eced2b5ebfb1daa	Unter Narzi?mus versteht man nicht nur das krankhafte Extrem der absoluten Selbstsucht, sondern auch Strebungen der Selbstliebe, wie sie bei jedem Menschen vorhanden sein k?nnen. Die Liebe zur eigenen Person ist ein Teil der Liebe insgesamt, ohne sie w?re eine Liebe zu anderen Personen nicht zu verwirklichen. Der Narzi?mus ist also nicht nur das erotische ?quivalent des Egoismus.

According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.<br>   <br>  What is the reason for being over weight?<br>  <br>  This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI. <br>   <br>  Basic understanding of loosing weight. <br>  <br>  Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.<br>  <br>  Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.<br>  <br>  What is a healthy weight loss?<br>  <br>  When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  How much is one pound of body fat?<br>  <br>  One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.  <br>  <br>  How many pounds should a person loose in a month?<br>  <br>  Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.<br>  <br>  This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.<br>  <br>  <br>  When an overweight person should start loosing weight?<br>   <br>  At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  How does body react to weight lose?<br>  <br>  Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.<br>  <br>  What is the relationship between body and body fat?<br>  <br>  Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.<br>  <br>  What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?<br>  <br>  This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately. <br>  <br>  What is the importance of body fat for a female?<br>  <br>  Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet. <br>  <br>  At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).<br>  Calories should be accounted for all other liquids.<br>  <br>  Why water?<br>  <br>  Water is a universal solvent, means it dissolves almost every thing at least in very minute quantities. This helps purification of body.<br>  <br>  Eat <br>  <br>  What should be your proportionate in take of fat, Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates? <br>  <br>  This depends on what your need are.<br>  <br>  1.Need to reduce fat.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 30 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 60 percent of 1500 calories per day = 900 calories.<br>         <br>  2.Need more energy.<br>       <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 40 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>         <br>  3.Need to reduce weight only.<br>  <br>  Fat: 25 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 375 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 25 percent of 1500 calories per day = 375 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>  <br>  4.Need to increase muscles bulk, but still reduce weight.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 15 percent of 1500 calories per day = 225 calories.<br>  Proteins: 75 percent of 1500 calories per day = 1125 calories.<br>  Exercise the muscles you want to develop, you can find right exercise on line, recommend use of light weights.<br>  <br>  Foot note: To take fat is so important, while reducing even fat, that it is included in all cases. If the fat is completely cut out, body will think of producing the fat, and will produce the fat by reducing metabolism, without fat in take, you may actually again weight even at lower than 1500 calorie level. You will feel run down and lethargic.<br>  <br>  How one must, drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  Every one may not be able to follow this regime.<br>  <br>  A 16 oz glass of water fist thing in the morning will be very healthy start. <br>  If you need to stabilize your stomach before eating, you can have a glass of water just before each and every meal. This is the easiest way to meet your quota of gallon of liquids.<br>  <br>  Eat<br>  <br>  To day almost half the world is starving. <br>  <br>  In western culture. Standard healthy practice for long time was three warm square meals per day. No eating in between, but children were allowed night cap.<br>  <br>  All that has changed, present thinking is 5 to 6 times per day. Any way what practice one follows is up to them; to each his own.<br>  <br>  Another best practice will be a glass of water before bed time, nothing to eat for two hours before bed time.<br>  <br>  How do I know the calorie count for various drinks and food?<br>  <br>  If you are buying packaged items it is on the package.<br>  <br>  Go on the internet and find the calorie information.<br>  <br>  Lots of cook book now a days list calorie per serving.<br>  Use your best guess, in this method use higher figure then you have guessed.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-mdp&p=Calories+chart">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a>|`|6aa2f0ef32dcce758ba638cb6d0104d3aa	get up early in the moring and eat sweets and go to **** immediately.<br>  <br>  that will increase your height also and weight also.<br>  <br>  very important is dont you ever forget to wash your ***.|`|2739aa817a733e25044bacbd2b39e2ecaa	hey i have a really fast metabolism too. whenever i want to gain weight though, i just eat a lot of carbs at night. like cookies, crackers, pretzels. just eat as many as you can before you go to bed!|`|2ce066b550053747813577c66388e884aa	If I were you I wouldn't want to be more fatty, it won't help anything in any way.

Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.<br>   <br>  What is the reason for being over weight?<br>  <br>  This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI. <br>   <br>  Basic understanding of loosing weight. <br>  <br>  Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.<br>  <br>  Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.<br>  <br>  What is a healthy weight loss?<br>  <br>  When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  How much is one pound of body fat?<br>  <br>  One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.  <br>  <br>  How many pounds should a person loose in a month?<br>  <br>  Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.<br>  <br>  This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.<br>  <br>  <br>  When an overweight person should start loosing weight?<br>   <br>  At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  How does body react to weight lose?<br>  <br>  Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.<br>  <br>  What is the relationship between body and body fat?<br>  <br>  Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.<br>  <br>  What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?<br>  <br>  This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately. <br>  <br>  What is the importance of body fat for a female?<br>  <br>  Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet. <br>  <br>  At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).<br>  Calories should be accounted for all other liquids.<br>  <br>  Why water?<br>  <br>  Water is a universal solvent, means it dissolves almost every thing at least in very minute quantities. This helps purification of body.<br>  <br>  Eat <br>  <br>  What should be your proportionate in take of fat, Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates? <br>  <br>  This depends on what your need are.<br>  <br>  1. Need to reduce fat.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 30 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 60 percent of 1500 calories per day = 900 calories.<br>         <br>  2. Need more energy.<br>        <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 40 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>         <br>  3. Need to reduce weight only.<br>  <br>  Fat: 25 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 375 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 25 percent of 1500 calories per day = 375 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>  <br>  4. Need to increase muscles bulk, but still reduce weight.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 15 percent of 1500 calories per day = 225 calories.<br>  Proteins: 75 percent of 1500 calories per day = 1125 calories.<br>  Exercise the muscles you want to develop, you can find right exercise on line, recommend use of light weights.<br>  <br>  Foot note: To take fat is so important, while reducing even fat, that it is included in all cases. If the fat is completely cut out, body will think of producing the fat, and will produce the fat by reducing metabolism, without fat in take, you may actually again weight even at lower than 1500 calorie level. You will feel run down and lethargic.<br>  <br>  How one must, drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  Every one may not be able to follow this regime.<br>  <br>  A 16 oz glass of water fist thing in the morning will be very healthy start. <br>  If you need to stabilize your stomach before eating, you can have a glass of water just before each and every meal. This is the easiest way to meet your quota of gallon of liquids.<br>  <br>  Eat<br>  <br>  To day almost half the world is starving. <br>  <br>  In western culture. Standard healthy practice for long time was three warm square meals per day. No eating in between, but children were allowed night cap.<br>  <br>  All that has changed, present thinking is 5 to 6 times per day. Any way what practice one follows is up to them; to each his own.<br>  <br>  Another best practice will be a glass of water before bed time, nothing to eat for two hours before bed time.<br>  <br>  How do I know the calorie count for various drinks and food?<br>  <br>  If you are buying packaged items it is on the package.<br>  <br>  Go on the internet and find the calorie information.<br>  <br>  Lots of cook book now a days list calorie per serving.<br>  Use your best guess, in this method use higher figure then you have guessed.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-mdp&p=Calories+chart">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a><br>  **************************************...<br>  Body Building<br>  BY<br>  minootoo<br>  <br>  You are blessed.<br>  <br>  How old are you?<br>  <br>  Most people put on weight after age 40.<br>  <br>  Any way before you try any thing, see a doctor to rule out any abnormalities (Hormone, Pituitary).<br>  <br>  Remember it is ten times easier to put on the weight then to take it off.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Body building is opposite of weight loss. But you must understand weight loss in order to build body.<br>  <br>  I will include my article on weight loss also.<br>  <br>  Most people eat protein reach food and complex carbohydrates, with one thing in mind, that they have to exercise 6 days a week and they have to eat more than what they burn off each day.<br>  <br>  If you eat about 300 to 400 more calories per day then you burn off, you have a weight gain of slightly less than one pound per week.<br>  <br>  You need to eat about 4000 calories per day minimum.<br>  <br>  If that does not work than slow down your exercises routine.<br>  <br>  In extreme case you will not exercises for two weeks at all, followed by vigorous exercises routine for six weeks.

AA10061233	Unfortunately, there is no medication for viral meningitis.  When you were a child, you were likely exposed to someone with bacterial meningitis.

c8b76be8f6bf2f5a698c0bd2d4432b45aa	You do realize that tanning booths can cause a type of skin cancer that is way worse than that caused by the sun, don't you?<br>  <br>  Any time you damage your skin like that, you are seriously increasing your risk of skin cancer. Why would you do that to yourself?<br>  <br>  My close friend died from a very agressive form of melanoma when he was 26, and he always used to go to tanning salons.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	No, do not go out to tan if you already have a sunburn (in fact, it's probably best to avoid going out to tan at all, but if you must, make sure your skin is in good shape when you start)|`|952329e019d09ef4c2108d3867a6683caa	MELANOMA|`|a2ad1e4ef837f49048406a50986af21daa	Even if it does not hurt that is your skin's way of telling you that have you overexposed yourself, and OVEREXPOSURE is what causes cancers, NOT tanning itself. <br>  <br>  If you burn, take a break until the burn is gone. If you continue to tan while burned, no matter how severe, you will continue to overexpose yourself and make it much worse, and there is a 50/50 chance you will notice a slight tan underneath the burn, but that is simply because when you tan your skin has it's max point. <br>  <br>  Say your max point is 10 minutes, and you do 12, you will produce a great looking tan in 10 minutes, but for those 2 extra minutes your skin will be overexerted. So yes, there is a tan underneath that burn, but you NEVER EVER need to burn to tan. Burning stops the tanning processn because you need to stop tanning, wait for the burn to go away, and then continue tanning.

Com ela, aprende-se a reduzir alimentos que prejudicam a saúde e o peso e a comer alimentos considerados deliciosos em quantidades moderadas e com prazer. Assim, dá para emagrecer gradativamente, sem sofrimento e respeitando os hábitos alimentares de cada um. Perder peso e conseguir manter-se nesse novo peso deve ser encarado como uma tarefa para ser cumprida em longo prazo.<br>  E n?o se esque?a de fazer exercícios físicos... por exemplo:<br>   a corrida é uma das melhores atividades físicas para gerar a perda e a manuten??o da perda de peso, pois tem gasto calórico elevado. Associada à reeduca??o alimentar, constitui um método eficiente para emagrecer. De modo geral, o exercício físico induz a adapta??es metabólicas, aumentando o gasto energético diário e minimizando a diminui??o do metabolismo de repouso ocasionado pela perda de peso. A combina??o de restri??o calórica e treinamento físico é excelente para o tratamento da obesidade. Mas a corrida só deve ser feita por pessoas que n?o tenham problemas clínicos que representem risco de complica??es com a prática como, por exemplo, pessoas com problemas cardíacos ou com diferen?a significativa entre o tamanho das duas pernas.|`|4bb454c3540ea1f242cdb1e1b3ef1db6aa	Outro dia eu conversava com uma menina que trabalha numa academia e ela disse que é muito comum isso por lá. <br>  <br>  A menina vai casar em julho e quer perder até lá 20 quilos. <br>  <br>  Outras compram um vestido de manequim menor que o seu e pronto, v?o e querem emagrecer pra ir naquela festa. <br>  <br>  Bem, eu te diria que será algo bem ferra de se conseguir.

Y esto es algo muy correcto, porque tanto las evidencias científicas como las experiencias en el mundo de los gimnasios y las pistas de atletismo avalan los beneficios producidos por su uso. Vamos a intentar responder algunas de las preguntas más comunes respecto a este producto maravilloso.<br>  <br>           ?Qué es la Creatina?<br>           Se deriva de los aminoácidos arginina, glicina y metionina, el cuerpo la fabrica básicamente en el hígado, los ri?ones y el páncreas, y también puede obtenerse a través de una dieta rica en carne o pescado (podemos encontrar unos 5 gr., de creatina por cada kilo de carne). Por lo tanto, habría que ingerir ?cuatro kilos de carne para obtener 20 gr. de creatina! La dosis inicial de carga prescrita usualmente durante la primera fase de la suplementación con creatina.<br>  <br>           La creatina se acumula básicamente en los músculos esqueléticos (aproximadamente un 98 %) en forma de creatina libre unida a una molécula de fosfato (PCr o fosfocreatina). La PCr sirve como fuente inmediata de energía para la contracción muscular, algo especialmente importante durante los ejercicios de breve duración, alta intensidad y carácter anaerobico. Otra función vital de la creatina es su capacidad para detener o rechazar los iones de hidrogeno, responsables de la bajada del pH del músculo y su conversión en mas acidico, un factor que contribuye a la fatiga muscular.<br>  <br>           ?Cómo Trabaja la Creatina?<br>           Cuando hacemos varias series de ejercicios anaerobicos intensos, el PCr se puede llegar a agotar incluso en 10 segundos, esto puede contribuir a parte de nuestra incapacidad para levantar pesos o al incremento de la fatiga. La suplementacion con creatina puede aumentar la creatina intramuscular tanto como en un tercio, lo que favorece la formación de PCr y a su vez ayuda para mantener una potencia máxima o casi máxima durante mas tiempo del habitual. Consecuentemente nuestros entrenamientos pueden ser más intensos y la fatiga producida por ellos inferior, lo que parece trasladarse a la larga en superiores incrementos del tama?o muscular.<br>  <br>           ?Cuáles son los principales efectos ergogenicos de la Creatina?<br>           La creatina ha demostrado potenciar los siguientes rendimientos atléticos y musculares:<br>  ? Incremento del máximo para una repetición (1RM) en el press de banca.<br>  ? Incremento del numero total de repeticiones con el 70% del 1RM en el press de banca.<br>  ? Incremento del rendimiento de la potencia.<br>  ? Se mantiene mejor el ciclo de potencia a lo largo de 10 repeticiones de 6 segundos.<br>  ? Reducción de la formación de fatiga.<br>  ? Aumento de la capacidad para efectuar repeticiones de saltos máximos.<br>  ? Aumento del tiempo anterior al agotamiento durante la ejecución de cualquier "Sprint".<br>  ? Mejora de los tiempos en carreras de 300 y 1000 metros.<br>  <br>           ?Cuál es la dosis ideal para producir un efectos ergogenico?<br>           La manera clásica de la suplemntacion de creatina implica una fase inicial de carga seguida de una fase de mantenimiento. Por lo general se ingieren de 20 a 30 gr. diarios de Monohidrato de creatina durante una semana, una dosis de unos 0.3 gr. por cada kilo de peso corporal. Esta dosis inicial incrementa aproximadamente un 30% los depósitos musculares de PCr. Los individuos que tengan más bajos esos depósitos son los que logran los incrementos mayores. Debido a que la cantidad de creatina acumulada en el músculo es algo limitado, se recomienda seguir con una fase de mantenimiento con unas dosis de 5 - 10 gr. diarios pueden mantener ostensiblemente los niveles totales de creatina establecidos a través del régimen de carga.<br>  <br>           ?La cafeína afecta positiva o negativamente a la creatina?<br>           Ha habido fuertes controversias respecto a la posibilidad de que la cafeína pueda afectar a la toma de creatina. Un estudio reciente comparo los efectos de ingerir creatina con la ingestión de creatina + cafeína. La cantidad de cafeína ingerida equivalía a dos tazas de café. Los niveles del PCr en el músculo se incrementaron en ambos grupos. Sin embargo, la producción de fuerza aplicada a una articulación, mejoro en un 23 % en el grupo de la creatina, pero no sufrieron modificación alguna en el grupo de la creatina + cafeína. En el estudio, la cafeína pareció impedir los efectos ergogenicos de la creatina. Sin embargo, hay muchos atletas que toman café u otras bebidas que contienen cafeína y siguen obteniendo los beneficios de la creatina. <br>  <br>            ?Cómo afecta la ingestión de carbohidratos a los efectos ergogenicos de la creatina?<br>           Se ha investigado los efectos de la ingestión de carbohidratos unidos a la toma de creatina. Durante cuatro veces diarias y a lo largo de un periodo de tiempo de cinco días, los investigadores proporcionaron a 24 hombres sanos, de edad promedio 24 a?os, 5 gr. de creatina o 5 gr. de creatina seguidos por 93 gr. de carbohidratos hiperglucemicos. Las dos suplementaciones incrementaron notoriamente los niveles de creatina muscular; sin embargo, el grupo que ingirió carbohidratos obtuvo un 60% mas incremento de la creatina muscular. La emisión de insulina estimulada por el consumo de esos azucares simples parece jugar un importante papel en le transporte de creatina hacia las células musculares. Algunos productos de creatina incluyen azucares en su formula para capitalizar esos efectos.<br>  <br>            ?Es cierto que la creatina afecta a la bioquímica de las fibras musculares?<br>            Los estudios demuestran que tomando creatina se puede correr durante mas tiempo y con mayor intensidad. Se ha observado que la creatina produjo un ligero incremento en el porcentaje de fibras musculares Tipo llB, las mayores de las fibras musculares. Teóricamente, si pudiéramos aumentar el porcentaje de este tipo de fibras tendríamos mas capacidad para producir un gran rendimiento de fuerza y de potencia, en relación con las otras fibras de Tipo llA y l. Un incremento superior de fuerza se puede traducir en el incremento del potencial para el crecimiento de las fibras musculares.<br>  <br>            ?Tiene la creatina algún efectos secundario que pueda resultar peligroso para el ser humano?<br>            El único efectos secundario conocido de la ingestión de creatina es el supuesto aumento de peso. Algunos informes anecdóticos sugieren que la creatina puede predisponer a algunos usuarios a padecer calambres y tirones musculares, pero esto es algo que todavía no ha sido demostrado.

Informa??es recentes<br>  apontam para as sérias conseqüências desses problemas. Em<br>  1990, nos EUA, 200 mil acidentes de automóveis foram causados<br>  por cochilos no volante. Já um ter?o de todos acidentes<br>  fatais com motoristas de caminh?es s?o relacionados à SE ao<br>  dirigir. As causas, oficialmente determinadas, de grandes desastres<br>  como o do Exxon Valdez, Bhopal, Challenger, Chernobyl<br>  e Three Mile Island ocorreram por impedimento de julgamento<br>  e desempenho relacionados à fadiga. Quarenta milh?es de<br>  americanos sofrem de distúrbios do sono cr?nicos, sendo que<br>  95% desses n?o s?o totalmente diagnosticados e tratados. Os<br>  custos diretamente envolvidos com SE e DS, em 1990, nos<br>  EUA, foram de 15,9 bilh?es de dólares.1<br>  Defini??o<br>  A sonolência é uma fun??o biológica, definida como uma probabilidade<br>  aumentada para dormir. Já a sonolência excessiva<br>  (SE), ou hipersonia, refere-se a uma propens?o aumentada ao<br>  sono com uma compuls?o subjetiva para dormir, tirar cochilos<br>  involuntários e ataques de sono, quando o sono é inapropriado.2<br>  A SE acomete 2 a 5% da popula??o, tendo como conseqüências<br>  prejuízo no desempenho nos estudos, no trabalho, nas rela??es<br>  familiares e sociais, altera??es neuropsicológicas e cognitivas e<br>  risco aumentado de acidentes.<br>  Por muito tempo, o sintoma de SE foi atribuído à depress?o,<br>  apatia, lacid?o ou característica de personalidade negativa.<br>  Nenhuma condi??o causa SE verdadeira, na ausência de sonolência<br>  fisiológica de base. Deve ser distinguida de fadiga e<br>  apatia, condi??es associadas com uma variedade de doen?as<br>  médicas e psiquiátricas (esclerose múltipla, lupus, cancer,<br>  infec??es, doen?a de Parkinson, acidentes vasculares cerebrais,<br>  síndrome da fadiga cr?nica, fibromialgia, depress?o,<br>  entre outras).3 A fadiga é referida como cansa?o, falta de energia<br>  e exaust?o. é geralmente induzida por excesso de atividade<br>  e aliviada pelo repouso. A SE é referida como uma diminui??o<br>  da capacidade de trabalho físico e/ou mental e tem,<br>  muitas vezes, alívio incompleto com o repouso ou sono e está<br>  geralmente associada a distúrbios do sono.4 Muitas vezes, essas<br>  condi??es, apesar de serem entidades clínicas distintas, coexistem<br>  no mesmo paciente. A presen?a de fadiga e/ou SE<br>  pode predizer doen?as psiquiátricas ou mesmo representar um<br>  prognóstico pior dessas.<br>  Causas<br>  As principais causas de SE s?o a priva??o cr?nica de sono<br>  (sono insuficiente), a Síndrome da Apnéia e Hipopnéia<br>  Obstrutiva do Sono (SAHOS), a narcolepsia, a Síndrome das<br>  Pernas Inquietas/Movimentos Periódicos de Membros (SPI/<br>  MPM), Distúrbios do Ritmo Circadiano, uso de drogas e medica??es<br>  e a hipersonia idiopática.5<br>  1.

AA12005596	Trata-se dos Exercícios de Kegel, uma técnica sugerida por muitos ginecologistas às pacientes para prevenir flacidez pós-parto e incontinência urinária. <br>  <br>  Outra vantagem: os movimentos ajudam a mulher a perceber melhor as sensa??es vaginais e, com isso, descobrir mais maneiras de sentir prazer. Esses exercícios s?o técnicas iniciais para a prática do pompoarismo. <br>  <br>  1. Contra??o vaginal <br>  <br>  Sentada numa cadeira, contraia os músculos da vagina como se apertasse algo dentro dela. Conte até três e relaxe. Repita dez vezes. Depois, contraia e relaxe rapidamente, como se quisesse imitar o ritmo de uma respira??o ofegante. Conte até dez novamente. Total: 20 repeti??es.<br>  <br>  2. Contra??o Anal <br>  <br>  Pompoarismo: <br>  <br>  Deitada, flexione as pernas e eleve o quadril. Fique apoiada apenas sobre os ombros e os pés. Contraia o bumbum, conte até três e solte. Fa?a dez vezes. Deite na cama e relaxe o corpo por alguns instantes. Depois, volte à posi??o anterior e contraia o anus em três tempos, sem relaxar entre um e outro: de leve, mais forte e com toda a intensidade. Fa?a dez vezes. Relaxe e repita o exercício, só que dessa vez você irá contrair n?o só o anus, mas também a vagina como se quisesse sugar alguma coisa com ela. Mais dez vezes. Total: 30 repeti??es.<br>  <br>  3. Suc??o vaginal <br>  <br>  Recostada na cama, separe as pernas e deixe-as semiflexionadas. Insira um dos dedos na vagina e aperte-o o máximo que puder. Caso n?o consiga apertar o dedo, insira dois. Fa?a dez vezes. Depois, tente sugar o dedo com a vagina. Ajude com a respira??o: na hora do movimento de suc??o do dedo, inspire e prenda o ar. Conte até três. Repita dez vezes. Total: 20 repeti??es.<br>  <br>  4. Contra??o de glúteo <br>  <br>  De pé, com os pés paralelos e distantes 20 centímetros um do outro, contraia o bumbum. Tente unir as nádegas o máximo que puder. Conte até três e relaxe. Fa?a dez vezes. Repita o exercício contraindo e soltando rapidamente, como se acompanhasse uma respira??o ofegante. Conte dez vezes. Total: 20 repeti??es.<br>  <br>  5. Movimenta??o do períneo <br>  <br>  De pé, com as pernas semiflexionadas e as m?os na cintura, mova a pélvis para cima e para frente, contraindo o canal da vagina. Conte até três e solte. Fa?a dez vezes. Depois, fa?a um movimento circular, como se usasse um bambolê. S?o quatro movimentos: primeiro, a pélvis vai para cima e para frente; depois o quadril vai para a esquerda; em seguida o bumbum deve ser impinado para trás; por último, o quadril vai para a esquerda. Fala dez giros completos. Total: 20 repeti??es. <br>  <br>  A dica é: n?o fique com pregui?a! Seu saúde – e seu prazer – agradecem!|`|32292ea3f00176533e0020668b1be63baa	Pompoarismo é o que se refere à ontra??o voluntária dos músculos circunvaginais, a fim de induzir sensa??es eróticas no pênis, durante o ato sexual.

Apenas a vagina e o pênis têm a fun??o sexual, e um completa o outro. <br>  Quando duas pessoas decidem pela penetra??o anal, significa a busca de estímulos nessa regi?o, mas em momento algum ocorre rela??o sexual, mesmo quando a penetra??o é feita por pênis. <br>  Com rela??o à pergunta, pode ser prejudicial para quem penetra sem usar preservativo (camisinha), pois as paredes do anus s?o repletas de bactérias, podendo contaminar com facilidade, principalmente se houver algum ferimento no pênis. Se o anus conter algum ferimento também, n?o importa a dimens?o, pode ser contaminado.<br>  O anus n?o foi feito para ser penetrado, portanto, se a pessoa deseja isso, precisa lubrificar bem toda a regi?o anal, precisa de muito estímulo e paciência do parceiro, pois toda interven??o com for?a provoca ferimentos. Em alguns casos, a pessoa acaba tendo de ser levada a um pronto socorro, podendo passar por uma cirurgia. Outro detalhe: ao decidir pela penetra??o anal, nada de fazer lavagem, pois ela prejudica a mucosa natural do anus. Neste caso, os parceiros precisam aceitar o fato de ter de penetrar sem fazer tanta higiene. <br>  A natureza n?o fez o anus para ser penetrado, embora é comum homem e mulher sentirem sensa??es agradáveis ao terem essa regi?o massageada, por ser ela cheia de nervos. Mesmo assim, ninguém deve se iludir, pensando em fazer "sexo anal". <br>  Ao dar essa orienta??o, n?o pretendo inibir o desejo de alguém, apenas fui sincero. A decis?o de fazer cabe aos interessados e interessadas.|`|PczQi4pcaa	Depende da posi??o em que esta...<br>  Brincadeiras a parte, n?o faz n?o , mas requer maiores cuidados quanto  a higiene, de preferencia deve ser feito com camisinha e lembrar sempre que após a penetra??o anal, n?o se deve fazer a penetra??o vaginal sem a troca do preservativo, pois pode ser um dos fatores que leva infec??es vaginais e ou urinárias...Fora isso n?o há o que se preocupar<br>  Abra?os|`|b0cFrbYKaa	O problema reside no calibre do pau do companheiro.<br>  <br>  Se o pênis for muito grosso, a mulher vai perder todas as suas pregas e ficará larga.<br>  <br>  O que antes era um buraquinho transformar-se-á num buraco considerável.<br>  <br>  Assim, com seu c.u. dilatado, ao ter vontade de c.a.g.a.r, a mulher terá dificuldade em segurar o negócio.

O pensamento dá a ordem e o subconsciente cumpre. Por isso, você é o resultado dos seus pensamentos. Seu pensamento é sua verdadeira ora??o. Todo pensamento que o subconsciente aceita como verdadeiro, ele move céus e terra para realizá-lo.<br>  <br>  Você mesmo já teve sonhos, em outros tempos, que lhe pareciam inatingíveis, mas hoje eles s?o realidade na sua vida. Para realizar um sonho você deve criar forte convic??o e n?o apenas alguma esperan?a. <br>  <br>  Se você tem convic??o, sua idéia surgirá, a cada instante, eletromagnetizada e essa for?a emocional sensibilizará o subconsciente, fazendo-o agir na concretiza??o desse desejo.<br>  <br>  O sucesso chega para aqueles que têm certeza do sucesso e, conseqüentemente, caminham na dire??o dele. Nunca diga que algo é impossível. Todo desejo refor?ado pela fé torna-se realidade física. <br>  <br>  PARA ALCAN?AR<br>  A vida é uma festa e está aí de bra?os abertos para acolher-nos carinhosamente e nos oferecer todas as dádivas. Isso é viver no mundo dos sonhos, pois quem vive, sabe que todo sonho se torna realidade. Todo sonho já é uma realidade mental que caminha a passos largos para a realidade física. Mas é preciso sonhar e usar os meios certos para atingir esse objetivo. é preciso querer uma coisa com o cora??o e sintonizar a mente na mesma freqüência do cora??o. <br>  <br>  Se você é uma pessoa honesta, leal e de bom caráter, mergulhe na abundancia divina que jorra para você como uma chuva torrencial. As riquezas do universo n?o s?o limitadas no sentido pregado pelos economistas. As riquezas, no sentido metafísico, s?o inesgotáveis e todos podem extraí-las para seu benefício e para benefício da humanidade. Quanto mais você acredita nas riquezas infindáveis do universo, mais riquezas atrairá para si. Quanto mais você acredita que as riquezas da terra est?o à sua disposi??o, mais rapidamente elas chegar?o até você. Se existem ricos ao seu redor e você é pobre, isto é a prova mais cabal de que você pode ser rico como eles, e até muito mais se assim o desejar.<br>  <br>  Você está pensando certo quando imagina – e a for?a do subconsciente está na sua imagina??o – a riqueza fluindo aos borbot?es para você, circulando por você e seguindo adiante. Você é o universo e, ao mesmo tempo, é parte do universo. Receba os bens, use-os à vontade, transforme-os e devolva-os à livre circula??o novamente. <br>  <br>  Você nasceu para viver na abundancia. Esta é sua única verdade. O resto é ilus?o. E n?o é certo que só poderá progredir dando murro e trabalhando como um mouro. Utilize seu talento, sua simpatia, sua personalidade marcante e fa?a a riqueza fluir naturalmente para você. Aproprie-se dela porque ela lhe pertence. Deseje o que é bom e este bem será seu. O homem é aquilo que pensa o dia inteiro, porque é o fervor com que pensa que faz o desejo tornar-se realidade física. é a lei da a??o e da rea??o. O pensamento é a a??o e a resposta do subconsciente é a rea??o.<br>  Diga muitas vezes ao dia, até impressionar vivamente seu subconsciente: as riquezas de Deus est?o jorrando vivamente para mim e todas as minhas contas s?o pagas devidamente e sempre ser?o pagas. Ainda me sobre a abundancia infinita. Sou imensamente grato ao Poder Supremo por fazer com que o dinheiro sempre apare?a para pagá-las e tomo o dinheiro necessário no meu Banco Divino. A cada pedido, o Poder Supremo sempre me atenderá porque essa é uma lei que nunca falha. Todo pedido já vem junto com o provimento. é a lei da opulência. Sempre que pe?o, já estou “ipso facto”, atendido. <br>  <br>  O PODER DE PENSAR <br>  Como é o pensamento que aciona o poder do subconsciente, na verdade pensar é poder. Acredite que você e Deus formam uma só unidade todo-poderosa e por isso você irradia paz para todas as pessoas. N?o deve existir lugar para tristeza, mágoas, ressentimentos, solid?o e nervosismo. Esse enlace com a for?a divina nos fortalece para enfrentar a vida. Isso é mudar o padr?o dos pensamentos e, conseqüentemente, mudar os rumos da própria vida. <br>  <br>  A FOR?A DA PALAVRA<br>  De Hudyard Kipling: “as palavras s?o a droga mais poderosa da humanidade”. <br>  <br>  Algumas palavras que irradiam energia poderosa: Amor, Fé, Sucesso, Riqueza, Paz, Alegria, Saúde, Harmonia, Vencer, Eu Posso, Deus, For?a, etc. A repeti??o de uma palavra tem for?a, note como s?o utilizadas pelos meios de comunica??o. Uma curta frase, repetida muitas vezes como numa can??o de acalanto, tem poder. Veja a ora??o. Neste caso você está usando, conjugadamente, duas for?as poderosas: a for?a energética do pensamento que tem a carga significativa da palavra e a for?a da repeti??o. Acredite na for?a de suas palavras. Fa?a jorrar o conteúdo de cada palavra como uma torrente irresistível, e verdadeiros milagres acontecer?o.<br>  <br>  “Tu Lho rogarás e Ele te ouvirá e cumprirá os teus votos. Formarás os teus projetos e ter?o feliz êxito e a luz brilhará em teus caminhos” (Jó, 27-28).<br>  <br>  A Fé COMO LEI DO PODER MENTAL <br>  Durante toda a história da humanidade a fé tem sido o grande suporte do homem. Todos os grandes líderes da Bíblia extraíram sua for?a da fé. Só existe uma forma de acionar o Poder Infinito que é através da fé. N?o a fé no sentido de um sentimento vago, indefinido, esperan?a imprecisa, mas fé no sentido de certeza de que seu pensamento é verdadeiro. Acreditar, portanto, é aceitar definitivamente uma coisa como verdadeira.<br>  <br>  A mente tem suas leis e seus princípios que nunca falham quando usados corretamente. O pensamento cria, o desejo atrai e a fé realiza. Isto quer dizer que tudo o que você pensa, deseja e acredita que vai acontecer, acontece obrigatoriamente. Pe?a e receberá! é um princípio simples, mas verdadeiro, porque todo pedido já traz, subjacente, o recebimento. Quando se pede, automaticamente, já se está sento atendido, assim como quando se bebe água, já se está matando a sede. O pedido existe para ser atendido. <br>  Entretanto, para ter seu pedido atendido, deve-se seguir o princípio básico da fé: acredite que o seu pensamento é verdadeiro, ou seja, que o seu pedido já está sendo atendido só pelo fato de ter sido formulado. Permitir a dúvida, n?o acreditando que vai ser atendido, é mandar duas ordens opostas e conflitantes ao seu subconsciente. E como seu subconsciente é o seu subordinado todo-poderoso, que n?o discute ordens, que n?o raciocina nem seleciona, vai ficar sem condi??es de realizar seu pedido. Mandar duas ordens opostas ao subconsciente é o mesmo que n?o desejar ser atendido. é por esse motivo que muitos pedidos e ora??es n?o s?o atendidos.<br>  QUANDO O ATENDIMENTO é AO CONTRáRIO <br>  <br>  Observe que, sempre que o seu pedido n?o é atendido, é porque você está fazendo duas ora??es opostas. Isso significa que você foi atendido, só que negativamente atendido, porque, entre duas ordens opostas e contraditórias, numa você acreditou muito mais do que na outra. E, nesses casos, com certeza, você p?s muito mais emo??o, muito mais energia, no pensamento negativo.<br>  Está errado, também, mentalizar durante dez ou quinze minutos por dia aquilo que se deseja e passar o restante das vinte e três horas e quarenta e cinco minutos mentalizando idéias de fracasso e inseguran?a. Você precisa acreditar. Desfa?a-se das barreiras negativas. A sua mente é cósmica, e, através dela, você pode entrar em contato com todo o universo. <br>  Quando o subconsciente está ligado a sentimentos de medo, de expectativa, de incerteza, tudo acontece ao contrário daquilo que se deseja.<br>  Ao pedir, veja a pessoa ou aquilo que deseja. N?o se volte para as imagens contrárias ao seu desejo. Fixe na mente apenas a imagem que verdadeiramente deseja e o seu subconsciente reagirá de acordo com isso. Ter fé é acreditar que a imagem colocada na mente se tornará realidade física. E quanto mais emocionalizado for seu pensamento, com mais for?a e rapidez vai ocorrer o resultado almejado. <br>  <br>  é a fé que opera no subconsciente. Na realidade n?o é a religi?o, o objeto ou a imagem que produzem o resultado, mas a cren?a que você tem de que esses elementos produzem resultado é que fará com que as coisas aconte?am. A fé é uma for?a irresistível imanente em você, no fundo, é a própria For?a Divina existente em você. Essa for?a n?o age movida por aparatos exteriores, mas unicamente pelo seu pensamento. Lembre-se que acreditar é aceitar o seu pensamento como verdadeiro, quer ele seja, de fato, verdadeiro ou n?o.<br>  Quando você acredita em alguma coisa o seu pensamento se dirige apenas nessa dire??o e ent?o aciona o Poder Infinito que está dentro de você e o Poder Infinito cumpre. Ent?o é o seu pensamento que se cria na sua mente a capacidade de realiza??o. <br>  <br>  PREMONI??ES<br>  De Shakespeare: “o bem e o mal n?o existem, é o pensamento que os cria”. <br>  <br>  A sugest?o é uma for?a difícil de resistir, mas toda pessoa tem o poder de conduzir e reprogramar sua vida conforme o desejar. A criatura humana, pelo fato de ter liberdade e capacidade de novas op??es a cada instante, pode, conseqüentemente, modificar qualquer premoni??o, por mais que aquilo lhe pare?a verdadeiro.<br>  No momento em que acreditamos em premoni??es estamos dando a outrem o poder de comandar nossa vida. Deixar-se influenciar é aceitar um comando dado por outra pessoa para reger nossa vida. E se você permitir que o seu subconsciente aceite, essa ordem vai realmente tornar-se realidade física. Portanto, nunca dê a outrem um poder que é só seu. é você que deve conduzir sua vida conforme sua determina??o e n?o se deixar subordinar pelos fatos aleatórios da vida. Se você acredita numa sugest?o negativa dada por alguém, na verdade n?o é esse alguém que está prejudicando você, é você mesmo que, ao assumir uma sugest?o estranha, adotou-a como sua, prejudicando-se. <br>  <br>  N?o acredite num destino fatalístico. Você pode modificar o destino a qualquer momento. Acredite que existe uma Sabedoria Infinita dentro de você e invoque-a sempre para que ela o conduza pelo melhor e para o melhor. Imagine-se transitando pela vida alegre e feliz e viva sua vida de forma maravilhosa. Exer?a você mesmo esse poder e ent?o estará acima das influências negativas. Ore, com convic??o absoluta, esta prece: “A Presen?a Infinita que está em mim e sabe tudo sobre todos me guia e me protege, ent?o nada de ruim poderá acontecer-me”. Nunca se perturbe e fa?a com que a Sabedoria Infinita, que habita o seu íntimo, oriente você corretamente, na dire??o do amor, do sucesso, da felicidade e da vida.<br>  Agora fa?a uma limpeza geral na sua mente. Destrua a ponte que o liga às influências negativas. Assuma você mesmo o comando do seu barco, pois ninguém quer mais bem a você do que você mesmo, portanto ninguém buscará com mais acerto o seu benefício do que você mesmo. <br>  <br>  OS MEDOS<br>  Todo pensamento de medo tem uma for?a magnética que atrai a realidade. Os medos nos enfraquecem porque sufocam nosso talento, achatam nossa personalidade, aniquilam a liberdade e a nossa autoconfian?a. N?o se deixe vencer pala crítica. Elas partem, muitas vezes, de pessoas que n?o est?o bem consigo mesmas. S?o peda?os da doen?a de outras pessoas que n?o podem se alojar dentro de nós. Seja você. Deixe-se guiar pela Sabedoria Infinita que está no seu íntimo e siga em frente de cabe?a erguida, sem se intimidar com comentários destrutivos. Acreditar no nosso próprio pensamento é acreditar que temos, dentro de nós, a Sabedoria Infinita. é confiar nela. Se há uma voz dentro de você, que gosta de você que quer seu sucesso e sua felicidade, é essa voz que você deve ouvir. Se desprezarmos aquele pensamento que é nosso, corremos o risco de ver, mais tarde, com magistral bom senso, precisamente aquilo que sempre pensamos e sentimos, e seremos for?ados a receber de outrem, envergonhados, nossa própria opini?o. Deixe que os outros pensem como quiserem. Apenas n?o permita que decidam num mundo que é apenas seu. <br>  <br>  N?o tenha medo de perder o amor. Quando duas pessoas se amam, s?o como duas metades que se juntam de forma t?o unitária que ninguém pode separar, a n?o ser vocês mesmos. é só cultivar e o amor continuará até o fim dos tempos. Mas o mais importante é que você nunca perderá o amor em seu cora??o. Se o seu amor se foi, saiba que você pode perder o amor do outro, mas jamais perderá o amor verdadeiro que habita seu cora??o. Este sempre existe em você, é inesgotável e tende, por sua própria essência, a encontrar a sua outra parte. N?o se feche e n?o sufoque. é na liberdade que o amor mais se desenvolve. Se você deseja ter um amor na vida, também é verdade que existe alguém que deseja amar uma pessoa exatamente como você. Você é como uma metade que está atraindo uma outra metade, cuja uni?o e fus?o formam uma unidade perfeita. Só o que você precisa fazer é atrair o seu amor para você o verdadeiro amor de sua vida. Acione o seu radar. E assim tudo acontecerá.<br>  N?o tenha medo do fracasso. Ligue sua mente no sucesso e terá sucesso. O negócio que você abriu é outro e nada tem a ver com o anterior. Para você criar uma imagem positiva mais forte, fixe sua mente naquilo que realmente almeja. Amplie essa vis?o e dê muita luminosidade a ela. Vá em frente com coragem, entusiasmo, dinamismo e inteligência. Ponha na cabe?a que aquilo foi talhado para você e sinta-se uma pessoa bem-sucedida. Aja como se já estivesse na posse daquilo que você almeja. Você é um vitorioso. O pensamento positivo atrai a realidade positiva. Use suas energias para progredir e confie na Sabedoria Infinita que habita sua inteligência. Essa é uma nova mentalidade para encarar a vida de frente. <br>  <br>  N?o tenha medo de envelhecer. Tudo tem o seu encanto. à medida que os anos avan?am, você passará a contemplar o mundo de um pedestal mais alto e, na medida em que diminuem os seus espa?os exteriores, ampliam-se, consideravelmente, os seus espa?os interiores. Ent?o nada há para se perturbar.<br>  <br>  Os valores mais fortes da vida, que mantêm uma pessoa vigorosa, sadia, jovem, produtiva, n?o envelhecem nunca. S?o o amor, a alegria, a paz de espírito, a bondade, a generosidade, a sabedoria, o poder mental, a felicidade, a lucidez e o ideal. Você tem a idade dos seus pensamentos. Você só envelhecerá quando parar de sonhar. <br>  <br>  A FOR?A DA SUGEST?O EM SEU BENEFíCIO<br>  A corrente positiva e a negativa coexistem. Nada dá certo para quem está mergulhado na corrente negativa e tudo acontece para quem está envolto na corrente positiva. Por isso é necessário fazer uma reprograma??o mental porque o homem é aquilo que pensa.<br>  Pela auto-sugest?o positiva você pode determinar que o seu subconsciente alcance o que você deseja. é no subconsciente que residem o Poder Infinito e a Sabedoria Infinita, que agem de acordo com as impress?es recebidas de forma marcante e unívoca, transformando as ordens recebidas em realidade física. <br>  <br>  Ent?o a sugest?o é uma for?a muito poderosa que deve ser utilizada em seu benefício. Ela pressiona o bot?o do subconsciente e o faz abrir as comportas do poder e da sabedoria. Ela tem mais for?a do que a própria realidade e torna a mente subconsciente submissa, impotente para confrontar-se contra ela. é por isso que a sugest?o pode curar e pode adoecer uma pessoa. Pode enriquecê-la e pode empobrecê-la. Pode erguê-la e pode rebaixá-la.<br>  <br>  Um método simples e prático para trabalhar a auto-sugest?o é a repeti??o: “Todos os dias, sob todos os pontos de vista, vou indo cada vez melhor em todos os sentidos”. Essa afirma??o deve ser feita de olhos fechados, com sentimento e de forma que você possa ouvir as próprias palavras e disso convencer-se. Os melhores momentos para esse exercício s?o à noite, deitado, quando você está querendo pegar no sono e de manh?, quando você recém acordou e ainda está em estado de sonolência. Fa?a a sua própria ora??o, pedindo tudo o que você deseja. Essa sugest?o, repetida em momentos estratégicos, lhe dará resultados maravilhosos. <br>  <br>  Quando a vontade e a imagina??o est?o em conflito é sempre a imagina??o quem vence. E quando a vontade e a imagina??o est?o de acordo, multiplica-se o poder e a for?a tanto da vontade quanto da imagina??o. Ent?o o uso da imagina??o lhe auxilia a alcan?ar o que deseja. A imagina??o sempre vence a vontade. é por isso que lhe acontece na vida n?o tanto o que você quer que aconte?a, como o que você imagina que vá acontecer. A imagina??o e a sugest?o geram a realidade porque acionam o subconsciente nessa dire??o. Toda ordem que você manda para o subconsciente com determina??o, ele trata de realizar.<br>  <br>  Muitas vezes você se queixa de que n?o consegue as coisas que mentaliza, mas se esquece de que há uma dicotomia nos seus pensamentos. Se você se programa para um determinado lado, mas acha que está mentindo para si mesmo, está mantendo duas for?as lutando dentro de si mesmo, cada uma querendo impor-se ao subconsciente. Nesse caso, o que você deve fazer é optar racionalmente pelo caminho melhor e procurar imp?-lo ao seu subconsciente pelo método da repeti??o, afastando a imagem negativa. Você já aprendeu que se mandar duas ordens conflitantes para o seu subconsciente ele tornará realidade aquele comando que estiver mais carregado de emo??o, mesmo que essa emo??o tenha origem no medo! <br>  <br>  O PASSADO<br>  N?o adianta se amargurar recordando o passado porque ele n?o vai mais voltar. Isso é desperdício de energia que poderá ser aproveitada em outra nova empreitada. Também n?o queira antecipar o futuro porque vai igualmente desperdi?ar energia. A vida é hoje, é o presente, é o agora. Você é o que está vivendo agora, por isso é importante organizar-se de forma a sentir-se bem no presente. <br>  <br>  O FUTURO<br>  Para assegurar um futuro maravilhoso, basta viver o presente de maneira maravilhosa. Aquilo que você semeia hoje, irá colher amanh?. Plante o sucesso e colherá sucesso. Nada há de incerto no futuro porque ele é a resposta do seu presente. Só cuide para semear no seu cora??o e na sua mente, sementes sadias e de alto astral porque o subconsciente n?o seleciona os pensamentos assim como a terra n?o seleciona as sementes que nela s?o jogadas. Nunca semeie fracasso. Viva o presente intensamente, com fé e confian?a total. Se você acredita em si, seu futuro será um sucesso. N?o cultive problemas. Expulse-os da mente e eles desaparecer?o. Esque?a-os e eles ficar?o na poeira da estrada. Negue-os e eles se evaporar?o. Defina o que você quer da vida e siga por essa estrada. Você chegará lá com absoluta certeza. A mente subconsciente responde de forma infalível ao que for programado. <br>  <br>  O PEDIDO E O ATENDIMENTO<br>  Todo o que pedires ao Pai, em ora??o, crendo que haveis de alcan?ar, alcan?areis. Trata-se de uma lei universal e, conseqüentemente, infalível como o s?o a lei da física da mecanica, da eletricidade, etc. Isso vale para qualquer pedido: amor, saúde, paz interior, casa, carro riquezas, felicidade, harmonia, inteligência, memória, emprego, viagem, alegria, calma, seguran?a interior, coragem, sensibilidade, intrepidez, sucesso, etc. Para tanto é necessário, antes de tudo, pedir. Pedir para que o Poder Infinito tenha definido, sabendo o que você quer realmente. Isso porque Deus sabe o que é melhor para você, mas deu-lhe a liberdade para escolher. Também esse pedido tem de ser feito em estado de ora??o, portanto, ao pedir, recolha-se para dentro de si mesmo e procure descer às profundezas de sua mente para que sua ora??o chegue mais límpida. Quanto mais profunda a sua concentra??o e mais passiva estiver a sua mente consciente, mais fortemente você gravará no subconsciente o seu pensamento. Como em estado de profundidade mental diminuem as rea??es contrárias da mente consciente, com mais facilidade e seguran?a você crê que vai alcan?ar o que pedir. Este é um requisito para o atendimento: crer que, só pelo fato de pedir, já está sendo atendido. Crer é ter certeza. Quando você duvida, está mandando duas ordens contrárias ao subconsciente: uma é a ordem daquilo que você deseja e pede e a outra é o sentimento hesitante de que talvez n?o seja atendido. <br>  <br>  Quando você vai retirar o dinheiro do banco, basta preencher corretamente o cheque, ter crédito e entregar o cheque ao caixa, n?o é mesmo? A partir daí você fica só esperando o dinheiro com a tranqüilidade e certeza absoluta de que o receberá. Pois é assim que deve fazer quando pedir algo ao Poder Infinito. Crie o sentimento de certeza de que, só pelo fato de pedir, será atendido. Assim, livre de preocupa??es, de dúvidas, de medos, de incertezas e de ansiedades, você alcan?ará o que almeja.Toda ora??o é infalível.<br>  <br>  O MUNDO A SEUS PéS<br>  Levante-se e ponha o mundo a seus pés. Comece desde agora a construir o seu mundo. Seja você o arquiteto e o engenheiro de sua vida. Você é uno com o Pai e nunca deve sentir-se como um verme rastejante. Sinta como é poderoso e livre! Seus anseios de amor e felicidade, seus desejos de viver em abundancia e na saúde perfeita s?o normais e legítimos. Este mundo cheio de belezas e riquezas foi criado também para você. Use a For?a Divina e terá o mundo a seus pés. Use o Poder Infinito que está dentro de você e será um triunfador. Use a Sabedoria Infinita que está em você e saberá chegar aonde deseja. Mergulhe na Presen?a Infinita e nada de mal poderá acontecer-lhe. Proclame, com vigor, para você mesmo: eu sou um vencedor. Assim é e assim será! <br>  <br>  Tudo o que você determinar, com convic??o, ao subconsciente, ele realiza. Aí está sua arma. à noite, ao entrar em estado de sonolência, repita, repita, repita: “eu estou em paz, estou alegre, dormirei um sono saudável e reparador e amanh? acordarei bem disposto, feliz e tranqüilo, em perfeita saúde física e mental”. Está feita a sua programa??o. Fa?a assim todas as noites e o subconsciente aceitará a sugest?o. Isso é assumir o comando da sua mente e n?o permitir que nenhum pensamento aventureiro lance m?o de você. Comece a imaginar-se – a for?a da mente subconsciente é a imagina??o – sorridente, alegre, calmo, bem humorado, vitorioso e em ótimo estado de saúde. Agrade?a a incrível aventura de estar vivo neste universo particular, saudando os filhos, os amigos, os familiares. Sinta-se uma pessoa agradável, benquista, admirada e querida por todos. Repita: bom-dia, bom-dia, bom-dia e levante-se em estado de vibra??o interior. Vá até a janela, respire o ar puro do amanhecer e saúde o céu, os pássaros, as plantas,o sol ou a chuva e as pessoas que já est?o circulando na rua. Diante do espelho, sorria para si mesmo e diga que gosta muito de você. Fale da sua admira??o pela sua coragem, pela sua valentia, pela sua honestidade. Cante, dance e seja uma pessoa admirável e bem sucedida. Pronto, está gravado em você um novo padr?o positivo de pensamento e de vida.<br>  Recorra também à visualiza??o. Visualize-se praticando aquilo que quer que aconte?a. Quanto mais claro e vivamente puder imaginar os detalhes, mais profundamente experimentará aquela situa??o que está determinando à sua mente. Relaxe os músculos e respire profundamente. Todos os grandes atletas de nível internacional e outras pessoas capazes de performances admiráveis s?o visualizadores. Eles vêem, eles sentem, eles experimentam antes a situa??o que enfrentar?o depois. Mas todos eles come?am com um objetivo em mente. Crie uma “zona confortável” interna. Depois, quando você chegar diante da situa??o, já estará t?o familiarizado com ela que vai sentir-se seguro para lidar com os fatos com maestria. <br>  O que se quer mostrar com isso é que se você hoje está na pior, n?o se julgue um derrotado, um incapaz, um pobre coitado, pois você está apenas a um passo dos homens de sucesso. Acredite na sua capacidade, na sua boa estrela, nos seus dons que emanam do Infinito. Em realidade somos mais do que conhecemos de nós próprios. Siga em frente, portanto. As portas da riqueza e do sucesso continuam abertas para você porque a sua for?a está conectada à Inteligência Infinita.<br>  Se até hoje você n?o foi bem, apague tudo e, a partir de agora come?e a ser um vencedor, alinhando seus pensamentos de fé no sucesso, eletromagnetizados pelo entusiasmo e pela certeza da vitória. <br>  O fracasso deve ser encarado de imediato como um fato passado. Ele foi apenas um requisito para você se aprimorar e alcan?ar o sucesso. Hoje já é outro dia e agora você deve sentir-se mergulhado na abundancia, na riqueza e na plenitude. N?o há carência para quem está mergulhado na presen?a de Deus, que é a Riqueza Infinita.<br>  Ore todos os dias: Deus é meu sócio e agora estou progredindo maravilhosamente. Sou guiado divinamente nos negócios e a Riqueza Infinita me provê de tudo o que necessito para pagar minhas contas e prosperar largamente. Obrigado Meu Deus. Muito obrigado Senhor. <br>  <br>  Em todo objetivo que tivermos em mente, é nosso entusiasmo que nos livrará do malogro. é a intensidade do nosso interesse por um resultado feliz que nos levará a alcan?á-lo. Se quisermos ser ricos, seremos ricos. Se quisermos ser felizes, seremos felizes. Todas as coisas nos s?o dadas de acordo com o nosso pensamento. Ninguém é rico por sorte e ninguém é pobre por azar. E também n?o há ninguém que tenha alcan?ado essas coisas tendo desejado o contrário. Só temos, ent?o de querer essas coisas com todas as for?as do nosso cora??o. A Mente Infinita atende a cada um conforme seus pensamentos.<br>  Se você deseja alguma coisa, construa-a mentalmente, pe?a-a, acredite que já está recebendo e tudo acontecerá de acordo. Dê vida às suas idéias. Aguce a criatividade que existe em seu amago e veja, por onde quer que passe, rios de fortuna jorrando em sua dire??o. Amplie essa vis?o e dê-lhe for?a e muita luminosidade! <br>  Para livrar-se da incerteza e da dúvida, medite e pergunte à Sabedoria Infinita se há alguma raz?o para n?o ter o que deseja. Quando há perfeita intera??o entre o sujeito e o merecimento, entre a mente consciente e o subconsciente, há sintonia entre você e o Poder Supremo que habita seu íntimo e, nesse caso, infalivelmente, a ora??o é atendida porque você agora sabe que merece. Deus só age em você por meio de você.<br>  Quando a mente consciente duvida, tem medo, ela torna-se negativa e passa a ser causa de dano. Você precisa acalmá-la, ou adormecê-la, tornando-a passiva para que n?o crie obstáculos às ordens que você está mandando para o seu subconsciente. Por isso há a necessidade de medita??o. <br>  Procure, ent?o relaxar a mente consciente, descontraindo seu corpo e concentrando-se profundamente no seu desejo. Acalme-se, solte-se bem, relaxe, feche os olhos e afirme, na sua mente, o quadro ideal daquilo que deseja ver realizado. Formule o pedido positivamente. Mantenha uma atitude serena, confiante e certa. N?o fa?a um pedido vago e indefinido. Pe?a especificamente o que deseja. Trace sua meta e deixe que o subconsciente providencie o meio para você chegar até lá. Tudo acontecerá conforme o seu desejo porque o Poder Infinito, que habita você, irá fazer com que as coisas aconte?am, acredite. Mentalize constantemente até receber. Você se sentirá impulsionado a dar os passos necessários para a concretiza??o dos seus desejos. Mas na hora que você for chamado a agir, aja!<br>  <br>  Sua meta reflete seu talento e seu sentido de miss?o. Uma meta eficaz concentra-se em resultados e n?o na atividade. Ela estabelece onde você quer chegar e, durante o processo lhe ajuda a determinar onde está. é gra?as à sua meta que o seu subconsciente o impulsiona a agir para chegar até lá. Identifique os objetivos que deseja atingir e mova-se nessa dire??o.<br>  Pe?a e mentalize quando estiver dominado por um desejo forte. Crie emo??o e sentimento. A satisfa??o ou prazer que causará a obten??o do pedido têm muita for?a emocional. Repita com freqüência, com sentimento e com persistência e busque conservar a imagem mental vívida em você. Você receberá infalivelmente o que pediu. <br>  <br>  Saiba que o subconsciente reage melhor quando você estiver em relax. Quanto mais calma e passiva estiver a mente consciente na hora de formular o pedido, tanto melhor. E n?o se ponha a especular sobre o tempo que irá demorar para ser atendido. Você será atendido. Você será atendido!<br>  Agora comece a agradecer. Diga: muito obrigado, Senhor, pois tu ouviste a minha ora??o. Tu sempre ouves o meu pedido. Estou sendo atendido em Teu nome e por isso Te sou imensamente grato. <br>  <br>  Um momento muito valioso para você mentalizar aquilo que deseja é à noite, quando vai dormir. Coloque-se numa posi??o confortável, relaxe e fique visualizando na sua tela mental aquilo que deseja. Adorme?a com a mente ligada nesses pensamentos. O seu subconsciente, nessas horas, está mais receptivo e pode ser que você obtenha a resposta até em sonhos.<br>  Mas qualquer outra posi??o de relax, em qualquer hora do dia, pode também ser empregada com muito proveito. é que o subconsciente n?o distingue entre a realidade e a imagina??o e buscará criar condi??es para transformar a sua imagina??o em realidade física. O que você cria na mente, acontece no mundo dos fatos! <br>  <br>  A MEDITA??O <br>  S?o quatro os estados de consciência: nível beta, nível alfa, nível teta e nível delta. O cérebro emite minúsculos impulsos eletroquímicos e a maior ou menor freqüência dessas pulsa??es ou ciclos é que vai determinar o seu estado de consciência. Quanto mais elevada estiver a sua freqüência mental, menor será a sua capacidade. Quanto mais baixa a freqüência cerebral, maior a sua capacidade. Beta é o estado mental em que você se encontra agora. é o estado de vigília, é o estado máximo da mente consciente. Representa, portanto, a mais alta ciclagem cerebral. Correspondendo a uma média de 21 ciclos por segundo. O panico, o susto, o nervosismo, a ansiedade podem, no entanto, elevar essa ciclagem até 60 ciclos ou mais. Observe que, quanto maior a sua freqüência cerebral, menor e a sua capacidade mental, a tal ponto de a freqüência máxima poder gerar um “branco total” na mente ou até mesmo paralisá-la. A acelera??o da sua freqüência cerebral faz diminuir proporcionalmente a sua lucidez mental, bloqueando a sua inteligência. E nessa ciclagem cerebral a mente n?o raciocina bem. é no relaxamento que a mente passa a funcionar melhor. Quando a pulsa??o cerebral se aproxima dos 21 ciclos volta a ser possível um raciocínio lógico e analítico. <br>  <br>  Mas o ideal para o nosso trabalho é o estado de alfa. Entrar em alfa é descer ao estado de relax profundo, mantendo a mente e o corpo, através de técnicas adequadas, em paz, em calma, sem tens?es físicas e emocionais. Pode-se descer ao nível alfa n?o só através de relax profundo, como também pela medita??o, pela contempla??o, pela ora??o. Nesse estágio, o ritmo cerebral se situa entre 7 e 14 ciclos por segundos. Nesse nível mais profundo, aumenta o campo da sua inteligência, da sua memória, da sua criatividade, da sua inspira??o, da sua percep??o sensorial e extra-sensorial e a sua intui??o é mais aguda. Toda programa??o mental que você fizer em nível alfa sensibilizará de modo efetivo o seu subconsciente, pois quanto mais profundamente gravar uma determina??o ou desejo no subconsciente, mais rápido e fortemente ele cumpre. O nível alfa é, portanto, o nível ideal para gravar profundamente.<br>  <br>  ENTRANDO EM NíVEL ALFA<br>  Pode-se recorrer a uma música calma, colocando-se numa posi??o bem confortável. Procure relaxar, respirando profundamente algumas vezes. Concentre sua aten??o nas diversas partes do seu corpo e vá relaxando uma por uma. Você estará relaxado se sentir, nessa parte, uma espécie de formigamento ou leveza, dando a impress?o de que essa parte do corpo n?o existe. Vá da sola dos pés até o couro cabeludo, incluindo todos os órg?os internos. Sinta a mente leve, límpida, em paz e calma, sinta o cora??o iluminado e feliz, cheio de boas inten??es positivas. Saboreie uma perfeita intera??o entre sua mente, seu cora??o e seu corpo e sinta-se mais leve, leve como a flutuar num mundo maravilhoso e sinta a serenidade de um lago azulado. Relaxe mais e mais. Agora você está em condi??es de se programar, de mandar alguma ordem para o seu subconsciente, está em condi??es de estudar e resolver problemas.<br>  O nível teta é ainda mais profundo e é o último nível que você atinge em estado de consciência. O ritmo cerebral fica entre 4 e 7 pulsos por segundo. é como se você estivesse em estado de sonolência, mas ainda está em consciência, embora em baixa freqüência. Por sinal, quanto mais baixa é a freqüência em estado de consciência, maior é a energia mental. Quanto mais diminui a fronteira entre a mente consciente e a mente subconsciente, mais você se aproxima da Sabedoria Infinita, do Eu Superior e da Mente Cósmica. <br>  <br>  Aproveite, ent?o, a hora em que vai dormir e deixe-se adormecer com o pensamento ligado naquilo que você deseja solucionar. Você obterá a resposta do subconsciente e essa resposta nunca pode ser errada.<br>  O nível delta é o do sono. Nesse estado a mente consciente n?o atua. Mas você pode programar-se para sonhar a solu??o de um problema, para alcan?ar a resposta de uma quest?o e assim por diante. <br>  Agora que você já tem asas, seja o senhor das alturas. Alce seu v?o e aventure-se pelos céus a fora. Voe bem alto, como uma águia.<br>  <a href="http://www.lema.not.br/indexxq2.php?pageartigo=faq&acao=resposta&sub=&princi=&recstart=0&q_id=274" rel="nofollow">http://www.lema.not.br/indexxq2.php?page...</a>|`|PXlYYTlvaa	Eu tive ins?nia durante 9 meses.<br>  Esperar o sono chegar n?o adiantava,ent?o comecei a levantar,assistir tv,estudar...<br>  Cada noite eu ficava menos acordada ,até q a ins?nia passou.<br>  Tome um copo de leite morno,ajuda.<br>  Bjsss|`|c724a51cd8ac98a9c76995de84f9e11caa	Tente nem cochilar durante o dia.Fa?a esfor?o físico.

was93X3daa	Sou contra o aborto no caso de irresponsabilidade humana, sabemos que o que engravida é fazer sexo, ninguém engravida por hosmose, a ciência nos proporciona inúmeros metodos para evitar a gravidez, é irracional n?o usa-los e depois fazer um aborto.Nesses casos acho totalmente incorreto é troféu de bobo, é como pilula do dia seguinte se as pessoas n?o tem sabedoria para usa-lá ela nao devia ser fornecida, inumeras mulheres utilizam essas pilulas de forma indiscriminada, porque acham mais pratico que tomar anticoncepcional.Acho a legaliza??o do aborto no Brasil quase que irracional.<br>  Essa é minha opni?o sobre o aborto, mas concordo plenamente com a legaliza??o do aborto, visto que devemos respeitar que cada um tem suas cren?as, cada um tem suas limita??es e que o seu corpo é de responsabilidade unicamente daquele que o possue, sou favoravél ao direito da livre escolha e da infroma??o.|`|0sLx4rB8aa	Olha acho isso um fato a ser pensado!<br>  Acho correto no caso do estrupo mas n?o creio que a<br>  regulariza??o seja correta pois vai ter<br>  um monte de vadias que v?o ficar abortando por ai sem ter<br>  vergonha do que esta fazendo!|`|PJAfSHaKaa	Sabe, eu n?o faria, mas n?o sou contra!<br>  Acho que cada pessoa sabe o que faz, como um assassino que mata pessoas inocentes.

O que pode acontecer é ter mais assistencia para as m?es que desejam, enfim, por algum motivo pessoal que n?o cabe a ninguem julgar. Acho também que é muito fácil as pessoas aqui falarem em pílulas e camisinha. Todo mundo sabe que é raro o casal, que conhece-se a tempos, usar camisinha, daí dizem , e pq a mulher n?o toma anticoncepcional. Pouis bem, nem em todas as mulheres isso funciona, podem dizer que é mentira, mas meu pai fez vasectomia após minha 2a irm? nascer pq minha m?e tomava anticoncepcional e chegava uma hora que o organismo acostumava e deixava d fazer efeito, assim nasceram minhas duas irm?s, e olha que minha m?e tomava certo o remédio. Voltando...: A pessoa que comete esse ato, pode n?o saber o que está fazendo na hora, mas algum dia verá, acredito que se ela n?o quiser o bebe, ela n?o terá de qualquer jeito, ou abandonará o mesmo, ou n?o cuidará enfim...<br>  muitos motivos, e cada um sabe de sua vida!<br>  Eu n?o faria, por principios meus. Mas n?o julgo quem faz, pq n?o sou ninguém para julgar!<br>  Cada um sabe de si, como diz a famosa frase:<br>  "Deus deu a vida para que cada um cuide da Sua"|`|SE7GyUftaa	Independente de achar certo ou errado, a quest?o do aborto hoje no Brasil é um caso de saúde pública.. Milhares de mulheres morrem após fazerem um aborto, n?o há assistência e muitas vezes o aborto é mal feito causando risco de vida para as mulheres. Quem quer fazer um aborto consegue, existem milhares de clínicas clandestinas ou nem t?o clandestinas assim que fazem.. ent?o por que n?o legalizar e regularizar essas clínicas para que amulher n?o corra risco de vida? é engra?ado como as pessoas usam discursos moralistas para resguardar a vida do feto mas n?o pensam nas m?es.. é por isso que sou favorável a legaliza??o do aborto e por considerar que a decis?o de ter ou n?o um filho cabe à mulher em quest?o. A mulher têm que ter direito ao seu próprio corpo e ter direito de escolher se quer ter um filho ou n?o, mesmo se for uma medida extrema como o aborto.. e ter toda assistência e cuidado, médicos e psicológicos para que ocorra sem maiores traumas e com toda seguran?a..|`|bd63b9cb1321658ce385fd2bad5e8ff0aa	Acho ridiculo a legaliza??o para matar um ser humano...<br>  acho que deviamos ter mais respeito a vida...<br>  acho que as pessoas deveriam pensar em se prevenir ao invés desse tipo de barbaridade...a unica quest?o que fico em duvida é nos casos de estrupo...|`|limEmGXsaa	Interessante como logo as pessoas levantam o dedo e a voz paracondenar os outros. Em caso de estupro ou em caso que ponha a vida da m?e em risco eu acho que está certo que seja legal mesmo, até porque quem fica falando que é horrível em qualquer circunstancia, será que já sofreu um estupro pra sentir na pele como é que é? Eu acho que o que alguns religiosos dizem o famoso "n?o julgueis paran?o seres julgado" se adapta muito bem aqui. Claro que quem aborta simplesmente porque n?o usou anticoncepcional e quer "se livrar do fardo" é abominável, mas às vezes fico em dúvida sobre o que é pior, abortar ou simplesmente pegar a crian?a com placenta e tudo, meter num saco e atirar num rio ou numa lata de lixo. N?o sei n?o. N?o concordo com o aborto, mas n?o condeno as pobres e traumatizadas jovem estupradas que n?o querem sentir crescer em seu ventre o resultado de um crime bárbaro, e ficar todos os nove meses, mesmo que vá dar a crian?a pra ado??o, odiando, sob efeito do seu choque emocional, aquele feto, porque está comprovado que a crian?a sente tais emo??es.

Pois antes de nascer, ele seria abordado...<br>  <br>  Sei que é uma idéia cruel, mas quem irá provar o contrário?<br>  <br>  Acho que todo caso de aborto deveria ser levado à julgamento, para avaliar se a familia n?o está estruturada para receber uma crian?a, ou se é apenas descuido...<br>  E familias que tiverem um filhos abordado, estas devem ser "estelizadas", o marido sofrer uma vasectomia, e a esposa um "rompimento" nas trombas.<br>  <br>  Desculpe-me ser t?o má neste sentido, mas n?o aguento ver familias das quais n?o agüentam com elas mesmas e tem mais 4, 5 filhos...

54843cb2f875ae217aa1efe71939bdabaa	Fimose, ao contrário do que muitos dizem e pensam, é estritamente a incapacidade de expor completamente a glande (cabe?a do pênis). Expor a glande significa poder "descobrir" a "cabe?a" do pênis, espontaneamente ou manualmente, com o pênis flácido ou ereto. A n?o exposi??o da glande se dá por aderência desta ao prepúcio (pele que recobre a cabe?a do pênis) ou por estreitamento do orifício prepucial. Na prática, em linguagem popular, fimose é quando você n?o consegue "abrir" o pênis, ou seja, puxar a pele para trás e descobrir a "cabe?a". A origem é congênita ou adquirida. O n?o tratamento da fimose pode trazer complica??es locais do tipo PARAFIMOSE , que é o estrangulamento da glande pelo prepúcio de orifício estreito. A fimose n?o tratada também dificulta a higiene local, favorece o aparecimento de infec??es, e é altamente implicada na gênese do cancer do pênis. A presen?a da fimose n?o altera o desenvolvimento do pênis. Freqüentemente se confunde a fimose com o excesso de pele ou o encurtamento do freio(cabresto) do pênis. Tal excesso de pele, só deve ser operado (retirado) se traumas ou infec??es frequentes se desenvolvem durante ou logo após o coito. O tratamento da fimose é sempre cirúrgico. No adulto, a cirurgia (postectomia ou circuncis?o) é feita sob anestesia local e dura cerca de 30 minutos. Repouso relativo de 01 a 03 dias; rela??es sexuais após 30 dias. Na crian?a, a cirurgia é realizada sob anestesia geral ou espinhal. Consiste em remover a por??o prepucial aderida à glande ou estreitada. Na crian?a, é comum a prática de "exercícios" nos quais os pais puxam o prepúcio sobre a glande, numa tentativa de romper as aderências. Tal prática deve ser evitada visto que causa roturas no prepúcio, agravando a condi??o. O correto é levar a crian?a ao urologista para que este decida entre esperar a resolu??o espontanea das aderências ou indicar a cirurgia. Se você acha que seu prepúcio ou freio do pênis tem alguma altera??o ou lhe atrapalha sexualmente de alguma forma, o correto é ser examinado por um urologista. <br>  <br>  <br>  ok|`|4OE7RLD3aa	sim e sim,portanto,qto mais cedo se fizer a cirurgia,melhor.|`|eb2b60f083b8041b0d6d47bd509ff5edaa	N?o atrapalha,mas a higiene fica restrita e incomoda vc em ter que capear....se tem mais de 12 anos pode fazer,é rápido e sem dor!|`|AA12005596	Ela for?a a glande.

O certo seria você e ele procurarem um médico, pois você pode estar infectada com algum problema que está ainda imperceptível.|`|bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	N?o necessariamente, amiga. Algumas doen?as sexualmente transmissíveis aparecem primeiro no homem do que na mulher, até pela própria anatomia. No homem, o mesmo canal compartilha a fun??o sexual e a fun??o urinária. Assim, se a uretra está irritada por alguma infec??o genital, a urina ao passar se encarregará de irritar mais ainda. Na mulher os canais s?o diferentes, e a mulher sempre tem alguma secre??o vaginal, o que pode mascarar por algum tempo uma doen?a sexualmente transmissível. Sugiro que seu namorado procure um urologista e de acordo com o diagnóstico dele, você procure um ginecologista. Boa sorte.|`|239ac81c8aab4eaeb545bc6f7a235c79aa	Ele esta com alguma molestia e vai passar p/você.|`|OzbPuiFAaa	Bom dia Debora,se a ardencia for ao urinar,é Gonorréia doen?a infectocontagiosa,provocada por gonococus,procure um urologista ou um clínico geral,o tratamento deve ser para os dois,abra?os álien a fera|`|ojPU0myeaa	talvez ele esteja c/ ifec??o urinária,mas é bom ir ao medico e ver direitinho,porque talvez pode ocorrer do medico indicar medicamento p/ os dois tomarem.|`|IX32Hk8Xaa	se seu parceiro ta sentindo ardência e vcs  tem rela??o sem o uso do preservativo,consequentemente vc tbm tera problemas ,as vezes a mulher n?o sente nada,o inc?modo,coceiras,ou coisas assim vem mais tarde,n?o necessariamente junto com seu parceiro,o melhor a fazer é proucurar seu ginicologista o mais rápido possível,e fazer um preventivo!beijooo|`|lZ08h1oOaa	Provavelmente ele esta com infec??o e provavelmente voce ja esteja tambem, em voce  pode ocasionar corrimento. é so ir no posto de saude la vao dar uns comprimidinhos que nao lembro o nome sao bem poucos e uma pomada pra voce eem poucos dias vao estar bem.

YOu will get back to the same problem when you stop taking them. <br>  <br>  My opinion, go check out some herbal source such as Bazhen, Eu Yan Sang Pills or even recently marketed GYNITA NOURISH. They helps regulates your period and readjust your body back to normal cycle naturally.

Mo5VOHxraa	Em primeiro lugar a denomina??o correta s?o energias renováveis de baixo impacto ambiental, pois alternativa deve ser referida a o quê. Exemplo: o petróleo foi a alternativa ao carv?o mineral. Se pensarmos em alternativa ao petróleo, eu acredito que n?o só o produto utilizado deve ser limpo, mas a sociedade deve funcionar também de forma harm?nica, pois o biodiesel ou aenergia eóliaca e solar se utilizadas de forma errada também podem ser socialmente e ambientalmente degradantes.|`|AA12005596	Eu.

Todos morreremos um dia e é certo de que temos um espírito que há de ser julgado um dia. Porém, qaui na terra ela somente deve eter canseira e enfado.

frpKiB16aa	Fimose<br>  Fimose é a incapacidade de uma pessoa expor (exteriorizar) sua glande (cabe?a do pênis) com o pênis flácido ou ereto. A dificuldade em expor a glande ocorre quando o prepúcio (a pele do pênis) possui um anel muito estreito, ou seja, a abertura do prepúcio é muito pequena para que se possa expor a glande. O problema pode ser de origem congênita (desde o nascimento) ou adquirida.<br>  A fimose pode se complicar quando ocorre a parafimose, onde a glande é exposta mas o estreitamento no prepúcio impede que seja recolhida, levando a estrangulamento da glande, ou quando impede a higiene adequada, levando a uma propens?o a infec??es (balanopostites).<br>  A fimose pode ser retirada por meio de cirurgia, geralmente realizada por urologista. Aplica-se uma anestesia na regi?o e retira-se a pele desnecessária. Após a cirurgia recomenda-se o repouso de um mês sem masturba??o e rela??es sexuais, e normalmente cessa o SANGRAMENTO NOS PRIMEIROS   QUTRO OU CINCOS DIAS|`|AA12005596	Claro que é.
