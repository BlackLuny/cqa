20061122134032AAo0mWG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How and if to come out when other things are involved?	I'm in my second year of undergrad right now and I've come to the point where I recognize I'm gay (I have also never been in an relationship, heterosexual or same-sex).    My severely homophobic parents currently cover most of my tuition and r&b.  Because of my parents finances, I don't qualify for much financial aid (around 10% max of cost, often in loans).  I have a few small jobs right now, not enough to live off of or pay for any decent school.    Should I just keep my mouth shut for 2.5 more years and then tell them when I get into a law school (Id get financial aid at that point)?  One or two of my really close friends at college already know and theyre being supportive (my college is also extremely gay-friendly) of sexuality although they tell me I should probably just keep my parents in the dark for now.    Also, is there anything I can do to make myself feel more comfortable with my sexual preferences w/o being so public to the point where my parents might hear of it? Tnxs.
20061124120610AAceAr9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who is aware that Jesus was written about by non-christian historians of the time?	Writings of non-christians about Jesus:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_t...       Since this is wikipedia, the best thing to do is get the names there, and then research what each writer said.      As for freet and other hardcore atheists, it doesn't matter what textual, archeological, or other kinds of evidence is found; they will always find a way to dispute it. Their minds are totally closed, and anything found that might prove the existence of Jesus is automatically deemed a fraud by these rabid atheists. Jesus said that people don't come to the light (Him) because their evil deeds will be exposed. These atheist are afraid to take an honest inventory of themselves and the hurt they have caused others, and that is why they refuse to believe that the existence of Christ might, at the least, be possible. I, for one, believe He is the Savior. Too bad these atheists can't open their  minds for one sliver of a second to that possibility.

20061127010218AA0xzci	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would you join pizdelica?	5 billion years ago a god named Potter created the greatest thing in history he called them life capsules, the only thing was he created too many life capsules. Potter decided to send all the life capsules out into the universe creating life, he then sent out a huge bolt of energy creating all the planets and stars. From there on life evolved into what it is today. Since Potter created life and all the planets he asked on thing and thats that man practice pizdelica, If man is a pizdelican he will go to pestopia to meet potter and live a great afterlife and possibley return to life one day.  If man defies Potter and does not practice pizdelica he will be bannished and sent down to zigophia where his soul will rott and suffer and he will recieve no afterlife.
20061129020215AAuSTae	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you know the life-span of the Tathagata?	well, how is possible that 25 old person to preach the truth to old wise people? How is possible that one relatively young person, who act as he have 25 years (see song "forever young") to teach all movie makers and love-song makers even the lovers themselves were not yet born?   "Milions, bilions of eons before I have attained Buddhahood". In Lotus Sutra it is stated very huge number of time to express this meaning. But the Law of Nam-myo-ho-renge-kyo is expressed as eternal, where eternity is declared as previous number multiplied by itself milions bilions times. In one word, it is eternity. Therefore, life-span of the Tathagata is eternal and also love is eternal and therefore the old wise people preach it.   The secret of the 16 chapter of the Lotus Sutra is explained by the words: "Once I also practiced boddhisatva austerities". It means that the lovers has suffered for love even before this life. In Buddhism, the boddhisatva has to sacrifice his or her happiness to help others.

20061130024604AAsR6Kc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians- Have you had any last days visions or dreams from Jesus?	Concidering that we are in the last days, God said in the last days your young men shall dream dreams and you old men shall see visions and your sons and daughters shall prophecy.  I have had an end time vision in the middle of last year  which was so real, and it was not hallucination as I do not drink or smoke.  There was a lot of destruction outside my unit, the sun went dark and the moon went dark as well, and there was people inside my place who were nonchristians.  I told them the truth, that they will go to hell and burn if they do not repent.  The did not believe me. I heard an auditable voice speak(God) in a voice of authority, telling them that I am right and to lissten to me. I then heard a knock at my front door, and then I answerd it. There were 4 Angels standing there with white robes on, then they flew me to Jesus where other people were gathered before him.  I ran up to him with my arms open, and that was the end of the vision. Have you had any.

I used to be an ugly duckling when I was a teenager, and now people seem to find me more attractive. It's true that I'm not used to too much attention. It has made me worry a lot about my appearance that I think of the worse scenarios happening to me. Since I am naturally hirsute, I am undergoing laser hair removal to remove hair from my face. Honestly, it's THE best thing that has happened to me! But, it has also made me be too anxious to follow every word of the doctor's advise, like not to remove hair from my face during the course. I used to be someone for whom plucking hair was as normal and easy as brushing the teeth, so I'm kinda used to it. But, now I'm afraid of even washing my face or touching the chin for the fear of unconciously removing hair. Even if I don't actually do it, I keep imagining that I have. I get depressed for hours, even days,when this happens. I am afraid of myself now. I don't trust myself anymore.HELP!
20061205081755AAqrueo	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Isn't this what Christmas is all about?	As retold by Linus,      And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.    And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.    And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.    For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.    And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.      source: The bible and my favorite Charlie Brown Christmas movie.

Something you don't mind   You can choose any, none or all of the above   I must point out though, that it is NOT against any State Dept. Health Code, or OSHA regulations (for patrons that is),to go bf anywhere,  including eateries. The signs that claim health code are simply wrong. Thousands of us barefooters have written all State health depts. and OSHA, and have confirmed this. Also, the liability argument doesn't stand because of a little thing called contributory negligence. The torts civil standard is that you assume the risk. It's also not so that you can contract athlete's foot or other disease if you're a barefooter, because if you habitually go barefoot, even if you come in contact with fungus or bacteria, you will not let it infect you because you don't provide it with a damp, moist environment. Therefore, a barefooter doesn't pose a health risk. look at  http://www.barefooters.org  for more info.

So now it's the third time she has blown me off while we were all together. I got really pissed and didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. Later on, she told me she has been spending more time with her friend because her friend might be moving. She also said that she hasn't been paying attention to me because I am not moving and I will be there. She treats me as a friend and hardly kisses or holds my hand anymore.

In my studies, a scientist said there are actually 12   vortexes, (spirals of energy), at work on our world.   He allegedly proved this making readings with certain instruments.    One is in the Bermuda Triangle. Another alleged to be   on the site of Solomons Temple and the Dome of the Rock.   I have seen photos from space using high tech photography that show what appear to be beams coming to   Earth.    Does 7 represent Light? Which is in actuality 6 colors.   Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Which combined make white, or clear light. 7. And multi-dimensions?    3.

20070314002016AAQnZUq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone experience this?	Far too many times anti-Islamists Christians had attacked my religion, and surely it pisses me off. Sometimes, I had the urge to attack the Christians, but then, suddenly I remembered someone said      "I prayed for you last time when you asked for prayers.."      There was this time I asked everyone for some prayers, and she prayed for me. And then one week later there was this day where the anti-islamic questions are a bit high, so I sorta attacked the Christians. Then she answered my question with that and it made me feel guilty..      So, from that day on whenever I had the urge to attack those who attack me, I remember my friends of that faith and how I would hurt them if I do so.      Anyone else have this particular experience?

Nessuno crede alle profezie di Nostradamus e di San Malachia che sembrano dovute a visioni del futuro o se volete ad allucinazioni o peggio a mistificazioni. Anch'io sono scettico però ora ditemi:  la Suora tedesca che con le sue visioni ha indicato dove aveva vissuto i suoi ultimi anni di vita la Madonna (vicino ad Efeso), visioni che hanno portato al ritrovamento dei resti della casa (adesso venerata da cristiani e musulmani)  con conferme di tradizioni locali che parlano di Lei e che vengono tramandate da generazioninei secoli, ebbene queste profezie  o visioni sono false o sono accettate solo perchè confermano il Credo dei Cristiani?

20070129125933AABo79F	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	A question for Fem Lesbians: Do you find it more difficult than straight women to make friends with women?	To clarify: When I say, "make friends" I mean regular pals, not sexual relationships.       Do you find it more difficult because your lesbians? Like for example, your out of school and have a good job. You'd like to make friends and have a life but the women at work have problems being around you because your a lesbian. Because your feminine and cute, some women who aren't as pretty may feel uncomfortable around you. They may even find you attractive and feel put off by it. Maybe some women who are religious feel that your a moral problem so they avoid you. (This also applies to being in school with other students who may treat you this way too).      Do any of you feel this way when all you want is to be treated like a human being, and have normal human interaction with people like everyone else? Or is making friends as easy for you as any straight woman? Or do you find it easier to make friends with guys. Or do guys just try to get in your pants even though your les?      Just wondering.

Delusion   Noun   1:  the act of deluding : the state of being deluded   2 a : something that is falsely or delusively believed or propagated b : a persistent false psychotic belief regarding the self or persons or objects outside the self that is maintained despite indisputable evidence to the contrary; also : the abnormal state marked by such beliefs       Now, does that not define religious faith?Sure sounds like it to me.What do you think?

20070127205324AAqix8U	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do people have to be Politically Correct in French too?	I once saw a woman who was disabled yell at one of her students because he said "disabled woman", and not "woman who is disabled".      In English the adjective comes before the noun, and therefore it is natural to say "disabled woman", but this woman argued that saying it this way put the disability first.      In French the adjective comes after the noun.  People would naturally say "woman disabled", just as they say "horse brown".  So what do they say: "woman disabled", "disabled woman", "the woman who is disabled", or something else?

Just real assholes and their wives are usually snooty "Stepford Wives" characters who like to spend much of their time gossiping about other people in their nice elite communities.

(non specifico per non offendere nessuno).    Da un po' di tempo si divertono a storpiare il mio nome chiamandomi con il nome di quel simpatico quattrozampe che ci dà il prosciutto (questo quattrozampe lo avete visto anche nello studio di Affari Tuoi quando conduceva Antonella Clerici).       Ho provato ad ignorarli e far finta di non sentirli, ma con questo si sentono autorizzati a continuare.       Piuttosto di rovinarmi la vita lascio perdere, ma un mio amico Poliziotto ora in pensione mi ha consigliato di fare querela.       Da quanto ho capito intanto che questo amico mi parlava, la querela non è altro che informare la Polizia di questa situazione. Ho capito bene?       Cosa mi consigliate di fare?       C'è un modo meno doloroso per chiedere di smetterla?

You ask us on a daily basis, "why don't you condemn terroism" and we tell you we do, as well as show you proof that nonbelievers are not to be harmed no matter what crazy extremists who belong in psyche wards say.  But you ignore us or don't bother to read it, turn around, and ask the same thing.  WHy don't you listen to us, for once?  On your questions, many speak up and many condemn it.  Not a single muslim supports it on any of your questions.  So why do you ignore them?      This link goes to where so many have condemned it, and even a march was held in Washington in 2006.  No media coverage at all.  Can you explain to me why all of this is ignored, but a single stupid man yelling "Allahu Akbar" gets so much attention?  Those few idiots don't speak for the rest of us!

There have been so many signs that have pointed back to him as well. things that have not let me forget I made a vow. I really believe that God is trying to tell me to stay strong and wait on Him and His timing even when the world is telling me, "Ahh move on, there are better fish out there". I just don't believe that, that is what Gods will and plan for me is. What do you think I should do? Do you think I am being decieved? or do you think that God is really trying to tell me He is not finished yet and I shouldn't give up either?

The word says that he called to them from the shore to come and dine with him, and they did, and that not one of them asked him, "who art thou"- knowing it was the Lord!    So I picture them all in awe, too dumbstruck for words, here's Jesus who was hung up on the cross for hours, after being severely whipped and beaten, who they also knew had been pierced thru the side with a spear, and blood AND water came out-signfying the spear had pierced his heart..then put in a tomb...so you tottally know they were like waiting! For what He would say...you probably coulda heard a pin drop..anyone else see this?    What does he do? he sits and eats!   While they wait bigeyed. hmmmm .why?

But like the ocean, when she is angry, she can be implacable. Therefore, she    represents the mother who gives love, but does not give her power away. Yemaya is also the owner of the collective subconcious and ancient wisdom, since she holds the secrets that are hidden in the sea. She is often invoked in fertility rituals for women and in any ritual concerning women's issues.

20060718142520AAvZVOG	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Help for an introvert?	I've been having some problems recently, maybe you guys can help?      I'm so introverted I'm practically inverted. I don't know what that meant.      The problem is, everyone thinks I'm being arrogant or stuck up, or playing favorites because my social circle is five people (the biggest it's ever been) when I really just don't like people.  Not because of their personalities, but because they're people, and they're in my space. I'm 14 years old and female, and this also causes problems because teenage girls just _love_ their numerous peripheral relationships, and yakking their tongues out. All of them except me, apparently.      I don't talk much, but when I do it's because I have something to say, and I know how I'm going to word it, but then people get all hurt because I don't want to have some superficial, stupid conversation with them.      Lastly, I don't go to school, which rocks. But I'm quiet, and pop culture bores me, so people assume I can't deal with people.       What should I do?

I admit it, but I'm not addicted to it.      I find that the mainstream porn is pretty much a lie, and I'll tell you why. It's the business to make bigger $$$$, and women get paid more than men, and to me that's pretty sexist. They have to look really good, and dolled up with tan oil with bigger breasts... The men can't be skinny, they have big toned muscles, and a big... Yea.      WOWY at first, then it becomes boring and too trendy, and it's pretty much a lie.      So I stepped out of watching mainstream porn, and saw the otherside, you know the underground of it, Like Bisexual Porn, Amateur, Bondage, Shemale, and Goth. These women don't look pretty as Jenna Jameson, and they don't have to be perfect... They look good the way they are.      Doesn't matter if the men have small penises or women having small boobs.... Sex is Sex if you know how to perform, and I saw the truth in that, and I appreciated more of the stuff that doesn't show up on Mainstream Porn.

Do you think that, in this time of war and pestilence (like it always is), and global warming, God is currently giving someone the power to save the world? Not like sending down Jesus, but giving someone the power to stop global warming so humans cant erradicate themselves? The times arent like they used to be. God never had to worry about us completely destroying ourselves, even after we made nukes. But with global warming and all, maybe he has blessed a baby, a child or a teen that is alive today with a gift, say, knowledge of the most efficient power source that we could create with our technology, like perpetual evergy, for example, to stop global warming? I know il probably get a lot of athiest answers like 'there is no god to give such a gift," or a lot of christian answers like "ONLY JEEEEESUS CAN SAVE US!!!," but, i can deal.

Someone today told me that in general Filipino women do not have the capacity to love as an American woman does, and that Filipinas basically try to sink their teeth into the first American they see to get a green card. Girl probably does not even know where the PI is on a map, and still has something to say about it.   My parents were immigrants, and I was born here, so I'm technically American.  However, I'll never be American because of racist people who only see that I'm brown and have a foreign sounding name.  It drives me crazy!  Please tell me what's going on with people.  When will we all just get along?  When will people look past cultural differences and stereotypes?  When will I, and every other minority person, be accepted as American?

20081005131956AAV8MaI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	What did your elders teach you about growing older?	My Dad died at 55 and my Mother immediately became an old woman.  She never learned to be comfortable with life on her own although she lived to 95.  She would dwell much too often in the past right up to her dying day.  We were a close family and tried to be with her as much as possible but she would have been happier if we had all just moved back home with her.  She was a good woman, just not an emotionally secure person and she would have preferred not to have outlived my Dad.  She never sang again after his death and when her own came, it was a blessing for her.     Because of Mother I vow to live life to the fullest every day and drag my way back up again when life knocks me down.  I vow to always look ahead, sure that another adventure is just up the road!

20080218113953AAW01eT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I have a poem.?	Here is a poem I’ve written please keep in mind that I am an MTF Transsexual.        I’ve lived my life as an empty shell I regret the time I spent in hell    I should have talked instead of walked but now I see what’s lay before me   I tried to hid from who I am but it just took me to death again    My heart is heavy my soul is sick    I have no friends behind to hid I miss her love and her soothing eyes    I must move on to my life’s plan    I never ran from what I knew but know I see my soul just loom    I lie awake at night to hid from dreams the dreams that hang till I die   I’ve lived and loved and all in vain for now I know life’s true pain    I never think all see the day when all my troubles might go away    but now I see it all to clear I hear the voice inside my ear the one I knew o so well the one from the years I spent in hell     now’s the time to sit and think for now I know what has come over me I long for hair that will not grow and soft breast that will never flow    I know my life will be in vain and O how I miss her far the well I will hear her back in hell    I know my life has just begun but I would rather run    My soul can go no further now I must rest and well I weight I see time pass within the wake I never knew her with so much hate    I see myself cold and dark never thinking of my heart    I will miss my strong back bone but will see the new me I’ve have never known    One who kills without the parting of a will is doomed to die and in his hand lay the master plan      My soul is blank and all is dank I see no place in which to think     I long for times that have past and now I know my life’s true path     I find all is gloom within my doom    I must lie awake to keep the thoughts from my head and as I sit and try to think my mind still tries to sink    I know all who know think I will fail and how I will prove them all so wrong when I come back o so very strong   We live to die and die to think why must I never wink    I still have trouble with my life but still I strive    Why do I exist so well when better men are doomed to fail      I will never know the love of life the gift of birth and sight of a child’s life    I was exposed to all too much when I saw my life get turned to muss     I know I will live a full happy life as long as I can see the light    Few know the pain I feel the thought of am I even real?    I’ve lived my life with few mistakes and I know I will never break    I see the hope that will always last as long as I can see life’s path    Now I sit and will think some more as I near the door of life’s true reward my true body lying on the ground just waiting to be found.   I will live my life no matter what and I know sometimes I will run amuck but will move on to better days as long as I keep death away.

In almost every movie from USA I ever watch, you refer to your country as "America". Even, in Macmillan dictionary, it says:             ...while there are MANY MANY other countries that are also Americans!      It's like if I, being Argentine, refer to my country as "South-America", ignoring that also Chile, Brasil, Paraguay, Uruguay, etc. are ALSO part of South-America.      SO MY QUESTION IS: Have you thought about this and then decided to call your self America, consciously? Or it has never ocurred to you?      I'm merely curiuos.    ps: Forgive my bad english...!

Simile discorso sulla prostituzione in genere... sono quasi tutte straniere le donne che "vendono" il proprio corpo per denaro... ma se nessuno di noi lo "comprasse" (o "affittasse" per qualche minuto) forse non ci sarebbero (ah già... ma quello è il mestiere più antico del mondo... anche allora erano straniere quelle che "vendevano" il corpo giusto?)

Isolationist attitudes are outdated. We can not depend on two huge   oceans to buffer us from the world anymore. Todays enemy envisions world dominance as those did in the past.

20070707175912AAQ8UoR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What the hell is going on with me?	My entire life i have liked girls, i had a crush on at least one girl through out elementry and middle school, i am now in 9th grade going on 10th and im so confused. I dont think im gay because i dont want to have sex with men nor do i want a relationship with them.  I do want to have a gf, and later on a wife and i do want to have sex with a girl.  But i find that when im in public i feel more confortable around girls.  Could this be because when i was younger my dad was always in college and i had to spend my young childhood with women?  I have these urges to look at certain men but i dont think about having sex with them.  This is very serious for me,  its made my very depressed to the point that i wanted to kill myself.  I said to myself that if i turned out gay i would never have a relationship with a man because that is against my belief.  So i would have to do the best with living alone.        Please dont go agains what i believe in and say "its not so bad".

I was thinking, if two identical people lived in two seperate places, one with 999 other people, and the other with 9999 people, would the first person in practical terms be ten times more important than the second, and would it be ten times less important if the second person went off the rails altogether and contributed nothing to the society they lived in. If this was the case, how big could a population centre get before a society collapses altogether?  What irritates you most about cities?

A febbraio andiamo in gita, 1 giorno, siamo in stanza assieme, neanche il tempo di farci una doccia, che lui è sopra di me, e mi chiede di rifare ciò che è successo tanto tempo fa. Prendo coraggio e gli spiego che sono gay. Lui capisce, accetta, mi chiede delle mie storie passate, scherziamo. La notte stessa mentre dormivamo, mette la mano dove l'aveva già messa, ci masturbiamo nuovamente, io gli pratico del sesso orale, dopodichè ci addormentiamo. la mattina tt come prima. durante la gita va con 2 ragazze. dopo quella sera più niente.lui continua a definirsi etero. ma secondo voi..???

20081005074827AA3ZGpb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	I have a problem with this article about gay elderly people?	I worked for years in nursing homes.  I then spent years more working as a private duty nurse in peoples homes, with 99% of my patients being elderly (usually late 70's to late 90's in age).      This article about the gay/lesbian elderly is stating that they face special problems of isolation as they age, because most do not have children, their partners have died, and family has sometimes denounced them years ago.      Here's my problem.  In the years I spent working with the elderly in both nursing homes, and in their own private homes, I found that family of any sort coming to visit them was an extremely rare thing.  I'd say LESS than 5% of the patients recieved a visit of any kind from friends or family ONCE in an entire year!      I took care of people of all walks of life.  An extremely famous M.D.  in his 100's, a famous Native American Indian Chief with great landholdings, a vivacious married couple who had both been extremely popular teachers at the local University they lived two blocks from, an extremely wealthy rancher and his wife, with ranchland messured in miles, not acres, a mother of 12, a mother of 10, a mother of 18, a famous author, a famous prize fighter....the list could go on, and on.      I'm talking about people who were famous, socially connected, powerful for the land they owned or thier pollitical connections, or the mother of numerous children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.      The SINGLE visit that was ever recieved by any of the above mentioned people...the married couple who had been teachers at the Unniversity.  Their nephew came by for about 1 hour with some legal papers for them to sign.  That's it.  Not a single other visit for these people (and I could mention a LOT more).      So my problem with the article is, I REALLY have trouble with the notion that gay/lesbian elderly folks are any worse off in terms of a suport system than the heterosexual folks out there.  In my years of experience, the elderly are completely forgotten. Sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.      Here's a link to the article:    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081005/ap_o...
