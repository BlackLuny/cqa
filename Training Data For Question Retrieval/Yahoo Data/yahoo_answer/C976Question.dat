The BBC has reported that the few England players in line to secure lucrative IPL contracts are very unhappy with having to pay 10% of their auction fee back to their counties.       Under the conditions imposed by the ECB, any player signing for one of the IPL franchises has to compensate his county for his time away by handing over the set amount.       In the case of Kevin Pietersen, whose base price has been set at $1,350,000, that would mean him having to pay Hampshire $67,500. But others will fetch far less. Owais Shah Will only have to pay $15,000 to Middlesex and Ravi Bopara $15,000 to Essex.       Are the ECB being tight wads or are the players just having a whinge?

20090205172115AAJg9qk	Sports;Baseball	Becoming decent in Baseball very quickly?	Hi, I have started to show up for baseball practice just recently. I enjoyed it and had a bit of fun. However, I talked to the coach again and he had informed me that he has nothing against me, however, he told me that my throwing arm is very weak. He had also informed me that if there needs to be cuts, I will probably be the person who will be cut out. I decided to stay after for practice about a month before tryouts begin, because I believed this will be the best time since I can learn to play. It seems that I had shown up a bit late, even though they are just starting  pre-tryout practice. I would like to know how to increase my arm strength so I can throw the baseball farther. There are a few more weeks till the tryouts start I presume, so what can I do to increase throwing strength?

Okay, so I am currently a sophomore in high school and i've always wanted to go back to playing baseball. I started playing baseball when i was 5 and continued up until i was in the 6th grade. Since then i've gradually become more and more out of shape. I'd like to start up playing baseball again my junior year but I would like to be in decent shape/condition so I don't look like a fool at tryouts. So, my question is, with summer creeping up slowly is there anything I can do from now and thru the time up until baseball season of next year to get in shape? Thanks.       Btw, I also have access to the gym, so feel free to add anything related to that.

20090205183935AAB8JjB	Sports;Running	Top of foot really hurts when sprinting?	To put it in a nutshell, I haven't had any injury to my left foot (my right foot however, I did sprain back in July). Track started 3 weeks ago, and about last Thursday-Friday, the top of my foot started hurting. It hurts more towards my ankle, all across the top, but more especially towards the outer side. And just a little lower down, it feels REALLY sore to touch. I can't really describe the pain, it just radiates from that area up towards my ankle.       I'm not the only one on my team with problems- other girls' ankles are hurting, and many have shin splints. But mine seem to get the worst of me. I struggle through the drills, and by the time we get to the get outs and intervals, it hurts so badly that the coaches make me do barefoot running on the grass. However, that's started to hurt too much too, so they have me sitting out part of the time. It drives me absolutely crazy- I finally got over all the initial soreness and being out of shape state, so my mind and my body are pumped up and ready to go. It's just that my foot keeps holding me back. I try to think mind over matter, but I only get enough to keep me through the drills. I really want to get back doing regular workouts with everyone else because I'm one of the fastest sprinters on the team. Does anyone have any idea why my foot could be hurting and how to help it?      I do stretch and ice in 15 minute intervals.

Who would probably be dissolved in real life?      As a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, I would bring in...      Peter Meuller, Shane Doan, Kyle Turris, Ilya Kovalchuk and Shea Weber. How about you guys? Remember, your choices are to be made barring any and all factors which could stop your team realistically from bringing them in to add to the roster.

Is there anything else I could try or a training program to get him back to a normal head collar and what should I do after he gets away when I catch him again because words don't work and if you tell him to do something o hit him(not hard) he practically runs over you! please help!

I'm a die-hard Suns fun and it kills me to realize that Amare is probably going to be traded (I hate Steve Kerr). I just hope we get some good players in return. Can you come up with some good trades that would be possible? They can involve any other players on the team too, except for Nash. I've been thoroughly disappointed in the Suns' play thus far in the season and I hope Kerr gets at least a decent trade for Amare.    Thanks.
