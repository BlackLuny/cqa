I submitted the I-864 form last month (as part of I-485) but it appears that I need to add a sponsor to it. Now USCIS is asking me to provide financial information which I know will not be sufficient. Question is - can I fill up a new I-864 form and submit it as a replacement for the one they currently have?      Thanks in advance!

I'm an American living and working in the UK since 2001; I have a National Insurance number, have paid taxes the entire time, am married to a British national, and we have 2 young children, both British citizens. My wife stays home to care for the children. I obtained Indefinite Leave to Remain status in 2005.  I am wondering if, should I become unemployed (as many are wondering at present), am I eligible for Job Seekers Allowance while I look for a new job?  Asking mainly for planning purposes.  If I'm not eligible then we may decide to move to the States, but I'd really hate to do that.  Any input most welcome.

Reagan's reckless tax cuts and increased military spending led to a huge deficit, destruction of our currency and total meltdown of our housing prices and stock market - just like now!   I know I lived through it and owned a house I got killed on too.   Bush I RAISED taxes and got us out of it, allowing Clinton and the Republican to balance the budget and cause the hugest economic boom this country has ever seen (which only broke down after Bush came in, lowered taxes, made us insolvent and started the whole crash thing over again).   Why can't people see this!   The deficit hurts out country - the higher it is the worst we do - EVERY TIME!

20090225024734AAGN8lX	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why are council workers so lazy?	They do NOTHING!!! It is so true, and you know it. You can't honestly say when you drive past a roadwork site, you see people working. 95% of the time when I drive past, they are lounging on the side of the road, in a large group, while OUR TAX MONEY is paying them!!! Doesn't that outrage you??? It does to me, and it's about time something is done, so our tax money is spent better. Think about when the governent announce they are spending billions of dollars on roads. That is just a monetary achievement. The government is publicising that they are spending money. Big deal. They are spending OUR TAX MONEY on lazy, underworked council workers. I have to go to work every day, work hard at what I do, and pay tax, which is ultimitely paying them. It is so unjust and unfair and pathetic.       Today, I was stopped at roadworks for 20 minutes, sitting in my hot, non-airconditioned car, whilst there was one person on each side of the road stoping traffic, and NOTHING at all being done on the road. In the end, I just drove through the site, as the two cars ahead of me did.       SO don't you think it's about time something is done to change the ways of the current council "workers" "working" habits.       Thank how good our roads would be if they actually worked on the roads, instead of lounging? Everything would be donw 5 times faster, so we would have 5 times more road projects done.       Even top gear proved council workers are lazy, by completing a road in 48 hours it took the council 3 or 4 weeks to do.

I TRUST IT WILL DO BETTER HERE, BUT PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SMUG REMARKS, THIS ONLY SHOWS YOU'RE IGNORANCE.  IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO MY POSTING, PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER.  THESE ARE OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS IM WRITING ABOUT.      Please read the following and tell me what you think.?      Why you think Government's in American and the UK treat our elderly people so badly.  BELOW ARE PENSION FACTS IN THE UK.      a.. The British state pension link with average earnings was broken in 1980.      Had the link remained, today's state pension for single pensioners would now be worth ￡145.15 a week rather than ￡90.70.      b.. By the time the link is restored by the government in 2012, millions of today's pensioners will have already died.      c.. The national insurance fund currently has a surplus balance of ￡46bn.      d.. Around 1.8m pensioners do not claim the means-tested Pension Credit, despite being eligible.  1 in 5 UK pensioners, from a 12 million generation live in poverty, with many thousands dying of starvation and cold every year.      Ide like your answers to why you think government's in Britain, and the USA, treat our old people badly.  Below are British facts and figures.      I strongly believe that the younger generations should support the old.      Now the question is, how many young people will respond to my posting.

If anyone if familiar with this, you apply to get out early if you like if your MOS isn't short-handed.  anyways, i received a 10,000 dollar enlistment bonus and ever since i was discharged they have been taking my federal taxes each year to cover the remainder of my bonus that i didn't serve out.  My main question is:  Who do I contact to find out how much i have left to pay on this??  I have been searching online and cannot find anything regarding this, and i'd like to find out before i file my taxes this year so i could just possibly pay it off before.  Thanks!!

20090225062140AASrI1t	Politics & Government;Politics	How can the definition of "earmark" be a subjective term?	Earlier I asked a question about earmarks in the stimulus bill.  Someone said that the word earmark is subjective because I pointed the question to  http://www.stimuluswatch.org.         According to WordNet at Princeton University, the word earmark is defined as:      noun    1.  identification mark on the ear of a domestic animal     2.  a distinctive characteristic or attribute [syn: hallmark]        verb    1.  give or assign a resource to a particular person or cause; "I will earmark this money for your research"; "She sets aside time for meditation every day" [syn: allow]        WordNet? 3.0, ? 2006 by Princeton University      In politics, earmark means that spending is pointed to a particular project.  For example in the stimulus II bill being debated in Congress right now, John Kerry has put this particular earmark in the bill:      Washington, DC - Senator John F. Kerry and Congressman John Tierney today announced a $50,000 Department of Commerce grant to the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries in Boston, Massachusetts. The funding will enable commercial lobster sea sampling in the southern gulf of Maine. The sampling will strive to be done at least twice a month in Exclusive Economic Zones, which extend up to 200 miles from the U.S. Coastline, such as the Lobster Conservation Management Area including Stellwagen Bank       http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?i...       Under the definition, John Kerry has said the following:      verb    1.  give or assign a resource to a particular person or cause;       "I will earmark $50,000 Department of Commerce grant to the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries in Boston, Massachusetts. The funding will enable commercial lobster sea sampling in the southern gulf of Maine"      How is this subjective?  He is stating a fact and following through with a promise to give money to a particular project if the spending bill is approved.

20090224175238AAwslTA	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can i still file a lawsuit?(details kinda long but crucial)?	When i was 10 i was mis-diagnosed with a stomach virus. For a week and a half to 2 weeks i continuously took the stomach virus meds and continuously got worse. One night my mother couldnt take it anymore and took me back to the doctors office. They were almost closing so they refused to see me. My mom yelled and made a scene until they opened the door. The doctor pushed down on my stomach and i let out a painful scream. He then looked at my mom and said "This child's appendix has ruptured she needs to be taken to the emergency room right now"      by the time i had my surgery my appendix had ruptured and spread infectiously throughout my stomach....      on the day i was scheduled to leave the hospital i woke up to my hospital gowncold and soaking wet.      i honestly thought i peed myself until i pulled up my gown and saw blood and puss where the incision was made      the surgeon came in and basically explained i would need to have another operation.      apparently they missed some of the ruptured appendix and it had now started infecting my stomach and eating away at it.         i dont remember waking up for 2 or 3 days. and when i did i was in ICU.      i had this gaping wound on the side of my stomach that i had to let heal from the inside, out.      i could literally stick my fingers inside it....      i now have this horrible scar and i just feel alot of this could have been avoided if i was looked at better.      as a child i even asked my mom if it were possible to sue...      at least for pain and suffering bc i was indeed in enormous pain and suffered greatly....even now.   (when i became pregnant and as my belly stretched it felt as if the scar was stretching too and it would hurt so much towards the end of my pregnancy)      she never wanted to do anything legal bc we arent a wealthy family and couldnt afford a lawyer....         but can we?         im 19 now.      is it possible to still file a lawsuit?         does anyone have any legal advice?
20090225043328AAYTd4p	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What would you do if you got a letter like this from your boss?	All My Valued Employees,      There have been some rumblings around the office about the future of this company, and more specifically, your job. As you know, the economy has changed for the worse and presents many challenges. However, the good news is this: The economy doesn't pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job however, is the changing political landscape in this country.      However, let me tell you some little tidbits of fact which might help you decide what is in your best interests.      First, while it is easy to spew rhetoric that casts employers against employees, you have to understand that for every business owner there is a back story. This back story is often neglected and overshadowed by what you see and hear. Sure, you see me park my Mercedes outside. You've seen my big home at last years Christmas party. I'm sure; all these flashy icons of luxury conjure up some idealized thoughts about my life.      However, what you don't see is the back story.      I started this company 28 years ago. At that time, I lived in a 300 square foot studio apartment for 3 years. My entire living apartment was converted into an office so I could put forth 100% effort into building a company, which by the way, would eventually employ you.      My diet consisted of Ramen Pride noodles because every dollar I spent went back into this company. I drove a rusty Toyota Corolla with a defective transmission. I didn't have time to date. Often times, I stayed home on weekends, while my friends went out drinking and partying. In fact, I was married to my business -- hard work, discipline, and sacrifice.      Meanwhile, my friends got jobs. They worked 40 hours a week and made a modest $50K a year and spent every dime they earned. They drove flashy cars and lived in expensive homes and wore fancy designer clothes. Instead of hitting the Nordstrom's for the latest hot fashion item, I was trolling through the Goodwill store extracting any clothing item that didn't look like it was birthed in the 70's. My friends refinanced their mortgages and lived a life of luxury. I, however, did not. I put my time, my money, and my life into a business with a vision that eventually, some day, I too, will be able to afford these luxuries my friends supposedly had.      So, while you physically arrive at the office at 9am, mentally check in at about noon, and then leave at 5pm, I don't. There is no "off" button for me. When you leave the office, you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself. I unfortunately do not have the freedom. I eat, and breathe this company every minute of the day. There is no rest. There is no weekend. There is no happy hour. Every day this business is attached to my hip like a 1 year old special-needs child. You, of course, only see the fruits of that garden -- the nice house, the Mercedes, the vacations... You never realize the back story and the sacrifices I've made.      Now, the economy is falling apart and I, the guy that made all the right decisions and saved his money, have to bail-out all the people who didn't. The people that overspent their paychecks suddenly feel entitled to the same luxuries that I earned and sacrificed a decade of my life for.      Yes, business ownership has is benefits but the price I've paid is steep and not without wounds.      Unfortunately, the cost of running this business, and employing you, is starting to eclipse the threshold of marginal benefit and let me tell you why:      I am being taxed to death and the government thinks I don't pay enough. I have state taxes. Federal taxes. Property taxes. Sales and use taxes. Payroll taxes. Workers compensation taxes. Unemployment taxes. Taxes on taxes. I have to hire a tax man to manage all these taxes and then guess what? I have to pay taxes for employing him. Government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with it, now occupy most of my time. On Oct 15th, I wrote a check to the US Treasury for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what my "stimulus" check was? Zero. Nada. Zilch.      The question I have is this: Who is stimulating the economy? Me, the guy who has provided 14 people good paying jobs and serves over 2,200,000 people per year with a flourishing business? Or, the single mother sitting at home pregnant with her fourth child waiting for her next welfare check? Obviously, government feels the latter is the economic stimulus of this country.      The fact is, if I deducted (Read: Stole) 50% of your paycheck you'd quit and you wouldn't work here. I mean, why should you? That's nuts. Who wants to get rewarded only 50% of their hard work? Well, I agree which is why your job is in jeopardy.      Here is what many of you don't understand ... to stimulate the economy you need to stimulate what runs the economy. Had suddenly government mandated to me that I didn't need to pay taxes, guess what? Instead of depositing that $288,000 into the Washington black-hole, I would have spent it, hired more employees, and gene

20090225073836AAp2FP5	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How much of a legal right does an 'absent' parent have to a child?	A friend of mine has a four year old son with an ex-boyfriend. The ex rarely sees the child, perhaps once every couple of months, sometimes more and sometimes less. He pays child support, but it is not always on time. As the little boy is getting older, the father sporadically mentions that he might take the boy away on holiday. His mother (my friend) knows that the child would not be at all happy to do this. He is quite a nervy little boy at times, and would be unable to cope with extended periods of time away from his mother and the people he actually knows.      The father doesn't seem bothered about spending time with his son to get to know him, and will be unlikely to do this, or even want to do this, before the summer (when he apparently wants to take the child away). My friend plans to say no to him, and make sure he can not take the child with him. There is no question in her mind about actually allowing it, since she knows the child is not ready for that kind of thing.      My question is, how much power would the father have to insist on the holiday? His name is on the birth certificate and there is no question about the child being his so the mum can't make waves with that. The dad has never been interested in the child very much, and the mum doesn't feel that he has considered the little boy's best interests in thinking about this situation. The mum would never stand in the way of her son's relationship with his dad, but she knows, and we all agree with her, that this would be detrimental to the boy's welfare.      Does anyone know what the court would be likely to do if it went that far? The dad can't prove that the mum has stood in the way of their relationship, since she has actively promoted it. But the mum will truthfully state that the father has no real relationship with the child and that it will terrify the kid to be taken away from her like that.      Would the dad be entitled to take the child like this? Where would the court likely side? Thanks for any help.

20090225040419AA24lfL	Politics & Government;Politics	Religion versus US politics: a question for the Conservatives?	Okay, I know that many Americans with Conservative politics are proudly Christian and of those have seen many express the belief that the two go hand in hand, especially over such issues as abortion and gay marriage.      It also occurs to me that I've seen many Americans, particularly Conservatives, express the opinion that it is for whatever reason wrong to increase taxes on those who earn more, or a fear that half of the american citizenship will have to support the other half.      My question is: surely the idea that the rich should support the less fortunate is part and parcel of the Christian philosophy?  A few examples- the parable of the good Samaritan; the idea that it's harder for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than enter heaven; Jesus' numerous exhortations that those who wish to follow him should go out and aid the poor.      Christians in general and Conservatives in particular: do you not agree that increasing taxes for those who agree to pay for such things as universal healthcare is a good thing?  If not, how do you reconcile these views?         As ever, please avoid answers intended purely as attacks- this is an honest question.

Last weekend I was up at my friend's college GMU and 3 of us were walking back to his dorm room from a party when we were stopped by 2 campus cops. When we asked the officers why we were being stopped they gave us no reason. They illegally searched the bag my friend was carrying and they found a couple of marijuana seeds and flakes so they charged us with possession of marijuana. I DON'T SMOKE WEED! I don't sell weed, I don't associate myself in any way shape or form with weed. I just happened to be with a couple kids who had a little bit of leftover pot in their bag. I took a drug test a day later and passed and I have 3 drug tests from the last 4 months that I passed. I've been having to take the drug test because I'm in the SEAL program. I went out and got the best lawyer and he said he can clear it all up but what if he can't?! WHAT SHOULD I DO?!!?!??!? MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN SET ON BECOMING A NAVY SEAL!!!! Even if I'm found innocent of the crime can it still affect me getting into the Navy?!            THEY WERE CAMPUS COPS. Complete and total douche bags who take their anger out on intelligent and physically fit teenagers because they went nowhere with their lives.

Why is getting high on something illegal if we're not hurting anyone?      Some drugs, such as MDMA, were originally used by psychiatrists to treat patients suffering from depression. The result of the drug on these patients was phenomenal; giving them hope and hapiness which eventually led them to escape their depression and get on with thier lives. However, the government becamse unhappy with people being able to feel happy legally, and decided to make it an illegal substance. I'm sure you've all heard this before, and about many other drugs which are now illegal today. It really doesn't make any sense but I know it's probably got something to do with the government wanting to control and lead everybody into the same path so that they can keep their power and positions.

I have taken in my sisters (3) children, and our CPS worker is a horrible person!! She is constantly saying rude things to me and about my house. She keeps telling her supervisor that she is scared to go to my house for pop in visits because I confront her and her methods. She will promise to get the kids something ( and it gets them excited) and then never does! I asked for a new worker and when I met with the head at CPS I was told that we are so close to the end lets just wait it out and that he will remind her about customer service policies. I had asked for (again) a new CPS case worker and the head guy said to meet and discuss this issue. Then after all I had said he told me that he has only known of one time that a person was able to get a new worker and that I wasn't. When she does her pop in visits and I'm getting ready to leave for an appt. or something, she tells me that if she does not do the visit that she can say to the court that I'm not cooperating and the kids can be taken away. I have had the kids for a year and a half, and the parents are getting out of the picture. Sad I know, but that's life sometimes. I love the kids with all my hart and will do anything for them.

Rewarded labor unions by revoking a former executive order that forced employers to notify employees of their rights.      ?

20090225080318AAK1hf7	Politics & Government;Elections	What will Obama do when the DOW hits zero?	Barack Obama and his Democrat majority may think they have a mandate to transform our nation into a European style social democracy, but Americans apparently have a different idea.      First, as we watch the stock market continuing its free fall, keep in mind the reason - Americans are taking their money out of the stock market. There are now millions of dollars sitting one the sidelines, waiting to see what happens. People are taking their wealth into their own hands to preserve it. I did that too.      Second, it’s interesting to note that the market started this latest fall as soon as the so called Stimulus package was passed in Congress. The market understands that this was not gong to stimulate anything, rather it was a massive tool to create bigger government than ever before dreamed of in this country.      In addition, the bailout money is being used to literally nationalize industry and there is a move on to nationalize banks. If government owns and controls the market place then there is no free market and nothing to invest in. We have watched the market sink by 50% of its former value in the past year and the fall continues. If there is no free market, it could in fact, fall to nothing because the stock market is a reflection of a free market. Government control produces nothing but misery and ultimate poverty.      Finally, as the linked item shows, the states are beginning to fight back and resist massive federal efforts to control them. For the first time since 1865, states are rediscovering their Constitutional rights as defined in the 10th Amendment. At least 21 states have now passed resolutions claiming their sovereignty and independence from federal mandates.

20090224194916AAmypLm	Politics & Government;Politics	Louisiana Governor Jindal a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012?	I'm a supporter of Obama. After tonight's speech to Congress I saw the GOP "rebuttal" speech given by Gov. Jindal. I couldn't help but notice that he seems to be a sensible, intelligent politician (although pretty much everything he said was highly Republican.) Nevertheless, he seems like he could have potential appeal to moderates, Republicans, and undecided voters.      Add to that the "revolutionary/historical" factor of him being of East Indian descent.       Could we see Jindal as the GOP challenger to Obama in the 2012 presidential elections?

20090225034526AAeY1we	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What do you think of this? Is the USA Stimulus package really worth having just anyone invade your privacy?	I found something of interest in the stimulus   bill.  (If you feel the same way about this please contact your senator,   and congressman.)  I urge all Americans and policymakers to carefully examine the    Final Conference Report,    Part A on the economic stimulus bill, pdf page 296 (p. 11)    and pdf pages 391-395 (pp. 106-110).   - The final economic stimulus bill permits Americans' personal health    information to be exchanged and sold -- without patients' consent --    for research and public-health purposes.   The bill also mandates the plan for each American to have a single electronic health record by 2014, without opt-out or patient consent provisions.  Research sometimes meaning some college pulling    certain persons in for research (so now people have animal status),   or the risk of using medical records that are not accurate.  It's like: How are you doing   Hitler?  Has the medical portion of the prison reopened?"  Yikes!

20090225040728AAbNJzO	Politics & Government;Immigration	Spouse visa application - Travel history checks?	I'm a male british citizen and in January 2009 I got married in Morocco to a Moroccan woman. We're about to apply for a settlement spouse visa (valid for 2 years) so that she can come to the UK.       She tried to come to see me in the UK in 2007 and applied for a visitor visa which was declined. Problem is - at the time of the initial application she said we met in Dubai even though we initially met in Morocco.      I think the reason she said it was because in Morocco the authorities frown upon non marital relationships - it's either marriage or nothing.      So the question is - now that we're applying for a spouse visa, if I confirm that we first met in Dubai, will they be able to check my travel history? If they can, then we're in trouble.      Another problem is I now have to say we met in Dubai because they'll check the notes made for her previous application.      Is there any way around the problem? I know it was a mistake to lie, but it's too late to take it back.

So many times have we been fed with this sad story about how Israel has been "genociding" the palestinian arabs for 60 years! What I can′t understand is the following. In 1947,there were less than 200000 arabs left in ALL parts of Palestine,and Gaza.Other 700000 ran to arab countries.   Now,only in Gaza there live over A MILLION of arabs,and another 1,6 Million live in Israel. How could the "genocided" palestinian arabs grow 13 times in just 60 years,from less than 200000 to 2,6 Millions?   During the WWII,when germans together with arabs were genociding Jews,the Jewish population decreasd from 12 millions to 6 millions in just 7 years.If Israel really "genocided" palestinian arabs,then for 60 yeas there would not be a single palestinian arab left alive.   But the arabs go on existing-and judgng by the photos,look quite fine.At least,undernourished they,evidently,are not.    http://www.hurryupharry.org/2008/09/12/l...     http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archive/20...

Perhaps genuine tax relief, the total elimination of federal income and payroll taxes for the 60% of income tax filers who make less than <$40,000 / year, would have been a far greater "stimulus?"

My husband has a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology, but with the unemployment crisis is unable to find a decent job.

I think it is Pretty well acceptable by most of us on this forum that New Labour and other mainstream politicians are totally corrupt.  Peter Hain for example accused of robbing a bank full of witnesses that said,Hey it was defiantly peter Hain that did it. Then he embezzles ￡100000 of tax payers money to fight an election which is totally illegal. Is he asked to pay it back? No of course not but he does resign from office. OK that's alright then isn't it?       He then turns up on Radio four slagging the BNP down and it appears that Radio 4 will quite happily give the fraudster as much time on air as he wants but again, of course that does not apply to the BNP because Radio four is democratic.      So how long do you think it will take the dictator and his gang to have Hain back in a ministerial position confirming New Labours contempt for the British Public      ATB Red

My younger brother's two idiot friends tried trading eight-hundred dollars worth of one-hundred dollar counterfeit bills for a dirt bike.

OBAMAS TWO-WEEK RECAP       1, The American people elect a black president with a total of 42 days experience as a U S Senator from the most politically corrupt state in America whose governor is ousted from office. The President's first official act is to close Gitmo and make sure Terrorists civil rights are not violated.       2, The U.S. Congress rushes to confirm a black Attorney General, Eric Holder, whose law firm we later find out represents seventeen Gitmo Terrorists.       3, The CIA Boss, Leon Penetta with absolutely no experience, has a daughter Linda we find out, that is a true radical anti-American activist who is a supporter of all the Anti-American regimes in the western hemisphere.       4. We got the most corrupt female in America as Secretary of State; bought and paid for.       5. We got a Tax Cheat for Treasury Secretary who files his own taxes.       6. A Commerce Secretary nominee who withdrew due to corruption charges.       7. A Tax cheat nominee for Chief Performance Officer who withdrew under charges.       8. A Labor Sec'y nominee who withdrew under charges of unethical conduct.       9. A Sec'y HHS nominee who withdrew under charges of cheating on his taxes.       And that's just the first two weeks . . . but who's counting.       America is being run by the modern-day Three Stooges ~ Barrack, Nancy , and Harry ~ and they are still trying to define stimulus.       Stimulus is where the government gives a smidgen of your tax dollars back to you making you feel so good about yourself [stimulated] that you want to run out to Wal-Mart and buy a new Chinese-made HDTV and go home and watch Telemundo!          I got this the other day & it would be absolutely hilarious if it weren't true!!!!!!!       My opinion is I disagree with it I think Obama has done a great job, and he will be a great President...

We've had very good luck with good tenants...and very very bad luck with break ins.  3 months ago his rental had the front door smashed in and they were looted.  It was very costly for us b/c we had to make repairs and find new tenants since they got scared and moved out right away.  Last night my rental property got broken into and my friends I rented it too got looted.  They really damaged the house and I'm sure I've lost my tenants again.  We don't have a lot of money and feel terrible for our tenants that have lost everything.  We never had a single issue when we lived in either of these properties..in fact we never locked the doors!  (I also have a huge scary dog). So we are quite shocked that this is happening! We were already shopping for alarm systems to install in all the houses we just were trying to save up the money to do it....now we had to use that money to replace everything.  Any suggestions?

Any suggestions? On a personal level I am well shot of him. I just hate the idea of him getting by scot free.

Hello,       I am a french lawyer and I know only a very few thing about the american system, so I hope you could help me...      A client bought a house in Los Angeles. He asked for a building permit. But it was refused, due to certain distance between the house and the street, the color of the walls, and some other things.      Unfortunalty, others houses (on the same street) have those caracteristics...      He would like to ask for the annulation of the city's refusale. For that, I need to have access to the building permit of the others houses, in order to prove that the refusal is illegal.      Unfortunatly, the city refuses to send me those documents (say I have to see them by myself, and I cannot duplicate them) and I need the agreement of the owners (they obviously refuse).      What is the procedure to have them send me (to france) those documents???? What kind of documents will they send?? I need the blueprints of the houses (for the measures)      Thanks a lot!

I work for part time at my job currently and have worked very hard to exceed my monthly goals so I can get in full time.  A full time position came open at my location and my boss asked me to come in early one day, not stating why and when I came in she offered the position to me. She stated she would try to get me full time status this month, but it would be no later then March 2nd. I accepted and did as she told me and "applied" for the position with Human Resources so I could start ASAP.  Human Resources contacted me and said they received my info and she knew I was already the candidate my manager wanted so it would be an easy process.  Well 5 days later my boss finds out a full time person is getting cut at another branch and she stated that she is coming to take the full time at my location (out of her control) since her position is being cut.  However, I called the ethics line at my work because I don't feel this is right when I was already offered this position.  In my situation I feel strongly this is unethical, however I don't know if I am going to get anywhere by calling the ethics line or not.

I don't mind having him around, I know he's not a criminal. I just don't want to get in trouble for some sort of crazy 'aiding and abedding'.

Couple months later I decided to build my dream house. I contacted BB&T Bank (same lender) loan officer to apply for the construction loan. I wanted have $500K for C.L. At the settlement I found something that Bank approved $800K and paid off my existing loan of $300k and gave me $500k.I asked loan officer that why he applied $800k instead of $500k. I wanted have just $500k for C.L. It looked like they refinanced existing mortgage and gave me a C.L. which I didn't request. He answered that to apply for the construction loan, lender must to close existing loan first (refinance) and approve C.L.   I had no choice but to trust him.   I don’t know. Is this right way to do it? Was he right about that?   *I believe I paid more money (closing cost) because of the volume of the loan.      Thanks.

Does anyone know the penalties for parent(s) who doesn't properly put their child in car seats. I tried to look it up but I can't find where it states what the penalties are. I have a 4 year old son. HIs dad doesn't use a car seat and sits him in the front seat of the car. I have pleaded with him to please put him in the car seat in the back instead of the front seat. I even told him that he is risking our son's life by not properly securing him in the car seat where he belongs. If and when I do, he just agrees with me but does nothing about it. I am at my wits end and scared to death that one day (god forbid) his stupidity and lack of respect for the law will cause lives. I was even thinking of talking to his next door neighbor who is a cop to have a chat with him about not putting our son in a car seat. I know I'm wrong about this but I'd rather be wrong than lose my son because his father won't take a minute to properly secure him in the car.

After Christmas Exodus all of the soldiers were drug tested and unfortunately my brother-in-law`s test came back "hot." Now they have explained to him that he will be receiving an article 15 and not some other thing (forget the name of it because it`s not a discharge) that could possibly put him out of the Army all together. So I guess you could say he is very lucky because the consequences of his actions could have been much worse. He has told us however that they have no "read" him yet...what ever that means. So he has no idea exactly how severe the punishment for the article 15 will be. The catch to all of this is that he will be finishing class for his training in 3 days and then is suppose to graduate some time around the 18th of this month. If he does receive the article 15 and he gets 45/45 which I guess means 45 days extra duty and 45 days worth of pay taken or something like that, will he have to stay at his AIT training even after his graduation to finish the rest of the 45 days or do they just let him go?? He is suppose to report to Fort Benning on March 13th which would be way before the 45 days is complete.

But I was told by a friend that I will not be able to re-enter the country with my F-1 visa because it is void after my marriage.(As now I have an intention to stay in the US)  The thing is, we haven't yet filed any change of status form, if I have not filed anything, is my F-1 still void?      We really wish to travel home this May because we already paid thousands for our plane tickets and I haven't seen my family for a long time.  Another friend suggested me to apply for my green card now and get the "travel permit I-131" with it. But it is already Feb 09, and I am leaving in 3 and a half months, can the process come quick enough ?      Or should I stay in the US and not leave at all ?

I have finally realized what it was that bothered me about the 100+ questions about tax problems.      It was a comment intended to be ironic regarding transparency.   I realized that his administration was in fact transparent, in that In Bush’s (and many other Presidents’) administration they would have simply appointed the person anyways (even if there were substantially greater problems, such as Chaney’s unethical conduct regarding his former position in a major business) and then hidden the truth, and then denied it, and then when they could no longer deny it they would have spun it until they figured no-one cared anymore, and then moved without making any changes based upon the discoveries.      Who agrees with this assessment?

He wanted to "reform" the health care industry with an unofficial lobbyist of the health care industry (and even said he "absolutely" stood by this individual after it was revealed this individual hadn't paid over $100,000 in taxes):       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090202/ap_o...

He SAID he would ban all lobbyists (then waived the rules when it mattered):       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...       He then SAID George W. Bush was wrong for throwing money at the banks (but now wants to do it ON A LARGER SCALE):       http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/busine...       He also said he would veto any bill with pork in it (the solution: SECRET PORK!!):       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090125/ap_o...       And then there's the pork-filled "stimulus" bill which includes:    http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/g...       ? $75 million for "smoking cessation activities."      ? $2 billion earmark to re-start FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Department of Energy defunded last year because it said the project was inefficient.      ? A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film.      ? $248 million for furniture at the new Homeland Security headquarters.      ? $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees.      ? $400 million for the Centers for Disease Control to screen and prevent STD's.      ? $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI.      ? $25 million for tribal alcohol and substance abuse reduction.      ? $160 million for "paid volunteers" at the Corporation for National and Community Service.

20090203144945AAQNGSt	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Below is what I believe Free Speech should constitute. What do you think?	Free speech is an inalienable right of a human being. Free speech includes but not limited to one's right to make statements that may be offensive, insulting and/or provocative to other people individually or the society in general. Free speech is one's freedom of criticizing and mocking any religion as well as religious figures. I believe, the only limitation free speech should have is anybody's calls to committing violence against other people (for example, "kill the jews" or "bomb the arabs" is not free speech and people should be punished for saying stuff like this). And, of course, nobody should have the right to shout "fire!" in a crowded movie theater if such alarm would be false.      Of course, one should always understand that he/she is or may be held responsible for his/her words.

Then you go to another doctor and find out that everything is not okay and you have some kind of condition, that possibly requires surgery.  So can you sue the first doctor, when in fact he had the information right in front of him of what was wrong with you and he chose to do nothing about it?        This is my case...my doctor chose to do nothing about what was right in front of his face.

I told him he should find someone on his ship to talk to like I know there is a Chaplain, and I told him he should talk to him/her because I thought they were supposed to keep people's personal problems confidential?  I told him this in an email today that he should talk to the Chaplain instead of keeping it all inside and being stressed but he said that he Chaplain could report him.  Is that true?  I thought that you would be able to talk to them like a councilor or something?  I don't want to go into all his personal issues on this site, but he isn't doing anything like truly illegal, he is having an affair, though, and he says he can get in trouble for it if they find out.  So do you think if he told the Chaplain about it that he would report him to someone or just listen and give him advice?  I just feel really bad that my brother has no one he can talk to and I can tell all his stress and worry is making him suffer emotionally.  Thanks for any advice you can give, I'd just really like to know if its true that the Chaplain would report him?

20090225063049AAK1ucI	Politics & Government;Government	Why is federal government so inefficient and incompentent under Republican rule..like under Bush?	is it because they believe in government so little that they actually purposely hire incompentent people to run departments or who actually believe those departments should not exist so that they fail when they are most needed....and government is seen to have failed and  then so the people have to say to themselves "oh gosh...government is so bad I do not want anymore of it..I do not want it to try to tell me it will protect me even in a crisis..not even against crooks like Madoff, or natural disasters like Katrina, or Corrupt greedy wall street speculators, for from what I see they can't do anything right".  Then the people will vote for Republicans since they are the party that wants government to be as small as possible, overseeing the least, regulating the least, and taxing the least to afford government.      And that the reason tax cuts, tax cuts, and more tax cuts....are so wanted by Republicans is that without money the government cannot run and that they would rather have 12 trillion dollars of national debt owed to other countries and tax cuts than to have a surplus and the appropriate amount of taxes to have a balance budget or God forbid a surplus....for that would mean that government is efficient, is run well, and has money to get things done for the people.  And that would be bad news for Republicans if that were the case.      Is this the logic?

I'm crap at running, push ups, crunches--I know you're probably thinking you wouldn't want someone like me in the Marines but I am DESPERATE but my question really is, can I do it? Because I hear all the time how MAJORLY difficult Marine training is and if I've never been very fit all my life then how can I suddenly do it now? Any help is appreciated beyond measure! Btw I'm 18 years old, thanks a lot.

I have stuck by him throughout this whole situation even though I know he was very dum to quit during a recession. He says he pur out resumes online but he needs to be more proactive and go search for jobs . When I went to see him yesterday and a few other days, instead of looking for work he is home playing xbox. I'm still hurt because he doesn't see the seriousness of this matter. I thought he was highly ambitious but he is not holding his weight. He think he is too good to take any job during these hard times.    He rents out a room and I have an apartment. I do not support him financially but he needs to get a job for himself and his kid    I buss my butt 6 days a week going to work and school ft and taking care my son (not his) and it id unfair to date someone who thinks the world will fall into his lap.

What does Obama plan on doing with our troops currently deployed in the middle east and what does he plan on doing with our troops in USA?    2.) Does he plan on sending more troops? If so, where to?    I might have a few more questions so if you reply to this I might have a few questions so please be sure to check back on this question a few minutes after you answer. Thank you

I mail in the fine and get it returned with a letter saying this is a criminal offense. Because the code he wrote down was a criminal offense.

"You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating the wealthy out of freedom.  What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else..  When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.    You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it."
20090203145737AAc6Cx6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How can I fight, appeal, a speeding ticket conviction after a court date?	I was accused of going 44 in a 30.  I was waiting to pull out onto a road and had to waite for cars coming through a light and then pull out behind them.  I was pulled over 1/2 block later for speeding.  There is no way that I was going 44 and the ten cars in front of me were only going 30.  A parade had just ended so there was an extreme amount of traffic.  I presented my case in court and had witnesses there that were in the car with me and felt really good about it until today when I received the courts decision in the mail.  The deciding judge was not even the judge that we presented our case too, but one that just reviewed the testimony at a later date. . . it explains in the courts decision that if I was stopped at a traffic light, then there would have been a break in traffic allowing me to reach the speed that I was accused off.  I never said that I was at a light, but had to waite for the cars coming through the light and then pull out behind them.  They obviously didn't read the testimony from that day.  I still want to fight this.  Its just the principle of the hole thing. . . Is there appeals process for something like this, or should I just write the judge a letter?

The Iranian leader called him "pathetic and weak"      3) Got into pissing match with Rush Limbaugh, thus helping solidify the Conservative base, give Rush new listeners all the while making Obama look week and Un-Presidential. most politicians know not to get in a fight with someone who buys ink buy the barrel.        4) Deferring to Polosi to right the porkulus bill the same day he promised to end washington pork.      5) Telling Republicans he wants to be bipartisan and then telling them 5 minutes later he Won the election.        6) Tied himself to the Porkulas bill, not knowing what was in it to begin with.

20090203100735AAhb1TD	Politics & Government;Politics	What if this happens to you?	It don't matter who you are or what type of life you are living. If those in power above you pulls the security rug out from under your whole family, it will put your life in a living Hell.  Your retirement savings yanked from you, you got 6 months of Employment Insurance checks to live on (if they send them), no jobs to be had. no health care insurance and your current bills keeps piling up.  Your bank is not working with you and demanding money, you fallen into home foreclosure and all you have left to survive on is what is left of your life savings if any is left now.  What would you do?  This isn't just a question, it is a reality for MILLIONS of Americans now today. Give it a thought before you answer, for it can happen to you next without warning

Bill Richardson, New Mexico's governor withdrew his name from nomination to be Commerce secretary because of a grand jury investigation over the way his state contracts were being awarded to political donors.      2. Nancy Killefer withdrew her name from nomination to be chief performance officer once it was discovered she had unpaid taxes.      3. Ex-Senator Tom Daschle withdrew his name from nomination to be Health & Human Services secretary because he did not pay $128,000 in back-taxes until January when he was nominated.      4. Timothy Geithner was confirmed to be Treasury Secretary despite paying $34,000 in income taxes late, once his nomination was in progress.   5 seconds ago - 4 days left to answer.

Basically, you brainwash him and put in a new memory and personality (maybe the memory and personality from his victim).  Should he go free?  This person now has no memory of his crime and in fact thinks he is the victim who has swapped bodies with the prisoner.

20090203145857AAwHyRt	Politics & Government;Politics	What is the cause of loss in scientific motivation in Muslim countries?	I wonder about this sometimes.     And I feel like the people are not to be blamed, they could be rather motivated if they were given the sources.   I currently live in Saudi Arabia and the bookstores have a great lack of popular scientific books, if there are any at all, and no books on philosophy either. They have books though that have pornographic content (Obviously un-Islamic). Sure, we can order now from Amazon, but in your youth, you just need something displayed there in front of you, or given to you by someone to find initial motivation.    Any other reasons that are less obvious?

20090203143238AADNrpX	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should I get a lawyer for my child support case?	I will try to make a long story short...   My son is 9 months old tomorrow and I have been dealing with his father since before he was even born. I won't even begin to explain the chaos and stress his father has put me through b/c it would take foreverrr to explain everything! I have been going through the court process to get support from him for so many months and it just keeps getting dragged out and put off for future court dates. The last court appt. his father didn't even show up and had his attorney tell me that I need to bring my son's social security number so they can get him on his father's insurance. I thought they would finally set up child support payments at this court hearing but they just continued it for another month!   My son's father still hasn't helped me pay for the $600 DNA test that he refused to pay for, even though he knew the truth about his own son! I just didn't know where else to start to get the ball rolling and get his unsupportive butt into court.   SO, I guess what I am trying to say is everytime I show up in that court room and see him there with his new girlfriend and his attorney I feel so vulnerable.   I don't want to get screwed over and have my son not get the support he deserves from his own dad. I don't think his dad realizes how hard it is to raise a child on your own!   I def. can't afford a lawyer, but I know they have 'court appointed' lawyers? Like I said, I feel so alone and I feel like I should get a lawyer and go kick this guy's butt and stop letting him take advantage of me! Any suggestions?   I know people always say, "the mom always makes it out in the end..." but who knows if that's always the case. I want to mention to the judge at the end of this month that he refused to help pay for the DNA test too let alone not support his own son for the past 9 months....
