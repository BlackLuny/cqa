Normalmente ci impiegano pochi minuti ad eliminare una domanda intelligente.   Ci sono volute sei ore,nonostante le tantissime segnalazioni, per la domanda del pedofilo.   Sono già partite querele e anche qualche denuncia rivolte sia al pedofilo sia ad answers (quest'ultimo per colpevole mancanza di vigilanza).   E' stata presa l'iniziativa di astenersi per 24 ore da entrare in answers il giorno 3 maggio , dalla mezzanotte di oggi a quella di domani.

Sabe que nossa vida pode ser *entalhada* dia a dia?   Estamos sempre “esculpindo” nossa história.   às vezes até com muitas dores...    Mas um novo ser pode nascer a cada instante...   Se você permitir e desejar.   Só nós teremos que prestar contas do que a gente fez da gente mesmo.   Logo mais estará no céu uma nova manh?.    E isso, por si só,    já significa uma grande novidade, um grande presente.    E essa manh? n?o tem nada haver com a manh? de ontem.    Afinal, a manh? de ontem já n?o tem  mais nada de novo...    O tempo segue seu curso enquanto você vai criando marcas para justificar sua história!      “O tempo n?o pára e,    no entanto,    ele envelhece.”       O tempo é o produto mais perecível que existe.   Por isso, atue!!!    Use sua energia para agir bem.    Use todos os canais de percep??o para contemplar o belo, o bom!    Você tem  todos os próximos momentos à sua frente.   Preencha o tempo com significado e sentimentos especiais.    Coloque para fora sua alegria de viver e n?o fique aí travando com suas preocupa??es, amarguras e outros bichos...    Nunca perca tempo pensando nas coisas que você n?o quer que aconte?a.    Elas n?o v?o acontecer mesmo.    Conven?a-se disso!!!   Ao contrário!!!    Ocupe seu espa?o mental com o que você quer que aconte?a.    é assim que você pode ficar mais próximo de seus sonhos...    E tem mais uma coisa:    Quando você se DISP?E a viver bem e alegre,    você contagia todo mundo e vive intensamente a VIDA.   Ame!!!    E...    Se deixe amar com intensidade!!!    Nada melhor do que amar verdadeiramente as pessoas que você escolheu para amar.   E...   AGRADE?A!    VOCê EXISTE!      LUZ

Um diz que vai acabar com a violência, haja paciência!   O outro jura que vai cuidar da nossa saúde.   Sei, vai é nos chutar que nem bola de gude.   Há quem prometa que vai se dedicar as crian?as de rua, que loucura!   E aquele outro que cismou que vai dar um grande apoio aos aposentados?   Esse já deve estar esclerosado!

Pago um plano de saúde absurdo, um verdadeiro abuso   por que nos hospitais do governo é impossível se tratar   chega a ser melhor morrer do que ir parar lá.   Passo as noites rezando pra ver minhas filhas que v?o badalar,   de volta, inteiras, ao nosso lar.   E chega a minha vez de votar.   Entro na cabine e tento me concentrar.   Inútil pois n?o paro de pensar   que nenhum deles, meus problemas, vai solucionar   ent?o como eu posso apertar a tecla confirmar?   **************************************...   Bem, cumpri meu dever de cidad?.   Voltei pra casa até animada.   Na portaria do meu prédio encontrei com uma das empregadas.   E aí Dona Silvana, em quem votou?

O menino olhava a avó escrevendo uma carta e perguntou:       - Você está escrevendo uma história que aconteceu conosco? E, por acaso, é uma história sobre mim?     A avó parou a carta, sorriu, e comentou:      - Estou escrevendo sobre você, é verdade. Entretanto, mais importante do que as palavras, é o lápis que estou usando. Gostaria que você fosse como ele!     O menino olhou para o lápis, intrigado, e n?o viu nada de especial.     - Mas ele é igual a todos os lápis que vi em minha vida!     - Tudo depende do modo como você olha as coisas. Há cinco qualidades nele que, se você conseguir mantê-las, será sempre uma pessoa em paz com o mundo.     "Primeira qualidade: você pode fazer grandes coisas, mas n?o deve esquecer nunca que existe uma m?o que guia seus passos. Esta m?o nós chamamos de Deus e Ele deve sempre conduzi-lo em dire??o à sua vontade".     "Segunda qualidade: de vez em quando preciso parar o que estou escrevendo, e usar o apontador. Isso faz com que o lápis sofra um pouco, mas no final, ele está mais afiado. Portanto, saiba suportar algumas dores, porque elas o far?o ser uma pessoa melhor."     "Terceira qualidade: o lápis sempre permite que usemos uma borracha para apagar aquilo que estava errado. Entenda que corrigir uma coisa que fizemos n?o é necessariamente algo mau, mas algo importante para nos manter no caminho da justi?a".     "Quarta qualidade: o que realmente importa no lápis n?o é a madeira ou sua forma exterior, mas o grafite que está dentro. Portanto, sempre cuide daquilo que acontece dentro de você."        "Finalmente, ele sempre deixa uma marca. Da mesma maneira, saiba que tudo que você fizer na vida, irá deixar tra?os, e procure ser consciente de cada a??o".       Paulo Coelho

The Child Who Walks Backwards      My next-door neighbor tells me   her child runs into things.   Cupboard corners and doorknobs   have pounded their shapes   into his face. She says   he is bothered by dreams,   rises in sleep from his bed   to steal through the halls   and plummet like a wounded bird   down the flight of stairs.      This child who climbed my maple   with the sureness of a cat,   trips in his room, cracks   his skull on the bedpost,   smacks his cheeks on the floor.   When I ask about the burns   on the back of his knee,   his mother tells me   he walks backwards   into fireplace grates   or sits and stares at flames   while sparks burn stars in his skin.      Other children write their names   on the casts that hold   his small bones.   His mother tells me   he runs into things,   walks backwards,   breaks his leg   while she lies   sleeping.               Thanks in advance! =]

20090211134223AAbDtJh	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	La felicità uccide l'arte?	non so se sono fusa dal troppo studio e mi metto a sparare cavolate.. ma pensavo.. che quando si è molto felici, quando tutto -o quasi- nella nostra vita ci va bene, non si è così ispirati come quando si soffre.   quando si è felici è come se il cervello si svuotasse, di colpo, per respirare.   il dolore soffoca, ci riempie i polmoni di aria viziata, ci occlude il respiro, così, per liberarci, dobbiamo trovare un modo alternativo: e usiamo l'arte.   certo, non è che la fantasia, l'immaginazione, o la capacità di scrivere bene spariscano di colpo, ma -almeno per quanto mi riguarda- credo che il dolore, il disagio, la sofferenza siano sempre stati e siano tuttora un modo per approfondire al meglio ciò che sentiamo.. cosa di cui forse non sentiamo l'esigenza se stiamo bene con noi stessi e con gli altri.   quando stiamo bene, quando nessuna preoccupazione ci sfiora, nè alcuna angoscia ci opprime, siamo in grando di essere altrettanto profondi?   e la cosa buffa è che il mio libro io l'ho scritto in un momento in cui effettivamente non avevo grandi problemi personali.   o forse si soffre sempre, ma non sempre consciamente.    Forse, per ritrovare l'arte, basterebbe scavare un poco più a fondo.   non lo so.   sto cominciando a perdere il filo dei miei pensieri.   non so se sono riuscita a farvi capire ciò che intendo.. nel caso.. che ne pensate di questi folli pensieri notturni?

Seguramente hay otros excesos abusivos en el mundo, pero ESE, resulta el mas ofensivo y degradante.Porque de acuerdo a lo que predican, Jesus, nunca precisò como escenario màs que una monta?a, rio o pradera; y como vestimenta solo una humilde tùnica, nunca esos costosìsimos atuendos dorados, y etc.etc.   Pregunta final: algùn dia esa historia cambiarà?

20090223004638AAgJjU7	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	What do you think of this photo taken with a Kodak Brownie camera?	I took this picture recently with my Kodak Brownie 2A (Model B) camera.  Keep in mind this is a 100 year old box camera.  (Well, actually the last patent date is 1909, but I have no idea how old this exact camera is.  I'm thinking it's from the 1920's at least).  I have a collection of vintage cameras, and when I found this one in an antique shop, I thought it was pretty cool.      I found a really simple way of using spacers on the film spool so that you can use 120 film with this camera.      Here's the camera:      http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/ga...          And here's the picture I took.  This is a contact print I made directly from the negative.       http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/ga...       And a higher resolution scan:       http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f86/ga...       Has anyone else tried taking pictures with a Brownie box camera?  Any opinions or suggestions?  It has a really slow shutter speed, I think around 1/30.  So I was actually surprised that I was able to hold it steady enough to get a clear picture.        The film was Kodak Plus-X.      The original print is better than the scan.  But the camera does seem to have a somewhat shallow depth of field, and the picture looks a little soft.  But still, I was surprised at how good the pictures came out.      Did any of the early Brownie cameras have a tripod mount?  I don't see any way of mounting this camera to a tripod...which would really help since the shutter speed is so slow.  I'm a young guy and I have steady hands and good eyesight, but even for me hand holding at 1/30 and looking through the tiny viewfinder is kinda tricky.

Last year I saw the audition dance and double turns like pirouettes were a requirement.      With the 7 weeks of class, will I be ready?   Should I also take a jazz class?

20081108135113AAShsK0	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Help With Shutter speed?	Hi.      I was wondering if a shutter speed of 1/15 with f22 would make a moving subject appear blurry because when i was taking a picture with my 35 mm camera, it seemed like a fast shutter speed, not a slow one.      Also, I was wondering if a shutter speed of 1/1000 with f2 will appear to "freeze" an action shot.  the reason why I am asking this is because the 1/15 with f22 seemed the same shutter speed as 1/1000 with f2 even though I was trying to take one picture where a moving subject appeared blurry, and one where the moving subject seemed "frozen".      Please help me!      THANKS!

Three best friends go on vacation and they order pizza but the pizza man is a kidnapper so he kidnaps the 3 friends with help fro, his two friends. They get tied up and they end up killing one of them but the other two people end up getting free and run off. They both take  for counseling two years. Then two years later they get called to court to tell their stories, but the two friends havent seen each since what happened.       So basically it goes from what happened during vacation, to the , to counseling,he court house. {so it goes back and forth}

I have a 35mm film camera and it doesn't take very good pictures indoors. When I'm outside and its sunny, is when the pictures come out really good! Just thought I should let you know....      1. "Tell a story from beginning to end in 6 or more pictures."   The example she showed us in class was a lunch being eaten. The first pic, all the food was there, and at the end all the food was gone. I  don't know what "story"to tell though.... I need ideas...      2. "Take pictures that represent YOUR family heritage or family."   All the stuff I want to take pictures of is indoors and the pictures don't come out very good as you know.... so how am I supposed to show our heritage if the pictures only come out good outside? This one is troubling me the most!!      3. "Take 2 pictures of only man made things. NO NATURE"   again, the only way to get my good pictures is if its outside... its really hard because if grass, food, or the sky are in the pictures, she'll mark me down.... she's a really tough grader!! D:      Please help me with ideas!! And if you figure out a way to fix the problem with indoor pictures, that will be greatly appreciated!! :D

20090223015806AAppTtf	Arts & Humanities;History	Help with year 10 history of medicine. Vesalius and Harvey?	could you tell if i've included enough information in my answer to this exam-style question? What would give in out of 8 marks?      Question: Who was more important in the history of medicine, Vesalius or Harvey?      Answer: Both Harvey and Vesalius contributed greatly in medicine and allowed future progress. It is difficult to determine who had made a bigger contribution to medicine as both have aided in different ways. Harvey’s work, for instance, wasn’t fully appreciated at the time, as discovering that the heart was pumping the same blood around the body and blood wasn’t simply being used up had had no practical use to doctors at the time. Yet Harvey’s discovery would lead to blood transfusions and the discovery of blood groups, which without Harvey would make surgery much more challenging. Vesalius’s discoveries on anatomy, gave us the first true description of the human body. Before Vesalius, doctors believed completely in ideas of Galen and, due to religion, never dissected human bodies to check if he was correct. The printing press enabled Vesalius to publish his work, this was the most anatomically correct text produced and included very detailed illustrations. Comparing the work of Vesalius and Harvey is hard as they both made discoveries in separate fields, Harvey worked in physiology and  Vesalius worked in anatomy.

There, in the dark air of a room,    lie this body, this body of great age, weary.   eyelids feel heavier. The heart pumps away with great effort.   inside dwells a mind, a mind with many years, tales, and wisdom stored within,    Breaths are shallow, and muscles are weak and tired.   Muscles that have withstood labor for so long.   The limbs flaccid and still.   The relentless beat of the pulse.   A pulse that has kept steady rhythm for decades   Blue eyes reflect the light of the moon as they stare into the blank ceiling overhead.   thousands upon thousands of gallons of water have passed through,   matched by tens of thousands of pounds of food consumed.   blood rushes through veins slower.   one last breath.   eyelids blanket vision,    The thoughts of a once restless brain halt.   and in one instant lifelessness consumes this being.   heat leaves the body. There is no fear when acceptance takes over.   and in these last final seconds, clarity takes the place of previous beliefs and illusions.   intense emotion floods in at an indescribable rate.   the divide between pain and ecstasy is broken.   and at last freedom's reign is restored.   and then   there is no future   no past.   only the   present   exists.   Nothing   matters.

Thoughts in my head run round,   What I want cannot be found.   Dreaming I am awake,   Awake I am dreaming.      Cured, the broken heart in my chest,   When in the ground my body rests,   From everything I shall be free,   When this world my soul does flee.

20090223002741AAmZKHi	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poem by: Jokke Yara. Thoughts? Analysis? Conclusions?	Her unnamed      Found guilty of those which I did not commit by the jury of my own chest,    divided as those of life.   Smouldering on the precipice of convoluted lies in a forsaken shell.    For the moment.    The eyes of those so loving, are betrayed by their forgetting counterparts…   something.      Found guilty of that which I did not commit by the jury of my own chest,   I’m sorry for you,    From inside this full heart is filled with…    Something.      From outside and behind as a self- forsaken shell I stand,    Turn around and leave, without goodbyes or regret….   Clear now.       No body owes you.   Not even the eyes of those so loving: yours truly   Yet I am not owed by those with whom I did not commit: her unnamed     Even with this pain, I am not owed by those whom I    Am giving my eyes so loving.    This circle of forgetting counterparts, follows as my eyes are deceived   By my own and by hers; her unnamed for her sake of herself.   She does not owe me   Because I did not commit.      Because I did not commit I was forgotten.   And because I did not commit I am forgetting.    Love for one and love for another,    Nothing for either with the other there.    All gone   Never clear   Convoluted      Jokke Yara

I recieved a Nikon D60 for Christmas and was wondering if It would be alright to use for my course.   On the application form it says quote:   Students would be expected to have access to a reasonable quality, 35mm SLR camera (film or digital) with manual capability.   What I'm trying to ask is will my D60 be okey or will I have to purchase an other camera.   Any help would be appreciated.   Thankyou.

Usually hedonism gets a bad rap, but what's wrong with it if you don't hurt another person and if you're responsible for yourself and don't hurt yourself either. It just seems that since the dawn of time, that humans have lived for their pleasures, they want the best life possible and they all want to be happy. Does hedonism have to be something that's completely bad?

20090223024252AA7ZGva	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Question about what I'm about to write...?	I have a short story written. However, I am just wondering about the legalities to such a story so I can know what to change.      It's a personal story about a failed relationship I just got out of. Now this thing is very personal, and adult themed. All the sex stuff and all is in there. Everything is true though. It's a real funny story that I'd like to share with some buddies.      However, I just want to make sure what's allowed and what's note. When writing this, do I have to change the names of people? I just used first names only.      Second, the girl cheated on me and it's in the story. Also in the story are several conversation logs which I have saved showing the said cheating, that she had between herself and other men. Am I supposed to cover up their screen names? I just removed the numbers from their names, and didn't mention what instant message client was used or anything of the sort.      I highly doubt anything would happen. But it's  a very humorous and embarassing story with many personal details. So I'm not trying to get in trouble for any defamation of character or anything xD. But I guess it all comes down to... do I have to change names? Also, what do I do about the conversation logs that are in there, do I have to change the screennames? Thanks!

20090223022238AACOYKP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can someone look at this very very short story and what do you think, thanks?	“Please leave my nightmares.”   She felt her tongue constrict as she looked up at him.   “Just please, leave them. You’re in my head.”   She sat in a semi circle of chairs, eating watermelon with her friends.   Her tongue could not unbind itself and speak.   “My nightmares…they’re interesting, to say the least. You’re a snake in one of them, wrapping yourself around an icy pond. Don’t ask me what it means symbolically, I’m sure Freud could come up with---“   “I’m going to call my mom,” she said. Her cheeks blushed and her eyes would not meet his. They focused absently on her list of contacts. She passed ‘Mama’ several times before realizing that she had.    “Your mom can’t protect you from anything. You might be done with me, with the past, but the past is never done with you. Call her. Why don’t all of you call your moms?” he asked the group of confused watermelon-eating girls. One of them laughed.   “The most incredible thing happens in the dream,” he continued, wanting so badly to penetrate her soul with his eyes. “The sun comes out, and…let me grab a chair…the sun comes out, and disintegrates the snake and melts the pond.”   There was silence.   “What was the sun?” he asked her, leaning towards her.   No response.   “In the dream, what was the sun?”   Silence and exchanged glances of worry and amusement.   “Well, the sun is the truth. The pond is how cold my heart became after you sunk your teeth into me. The truth kills you and the rock that is supposed to be my heart.”   “Basically, the lies you told me, the closeness I felt to you, was brilliantly conceived by someone with greater social skills than me, who could manipulate anyone whenever she pleased. It was destroyed by the truth. I am the Sun.”   He stood up.   “You’ll never understand what it means to be honest and truthful. You seek convenience. So do I, I suppose,” he said grabbing a chair and lifting it over his head. “This is pretty convenient and right now I’m acting on honest impulses.” He rushed towards her and swung downwards as hard as he could so that two legs of the chair broke on her skull and her chair, then he picked it up again and swung at her face. Her body slumped to the ground as her friends screamed and tried to attack him.    “Everybody loves you, oh they love you, because they don’t know you.”   Then he pulled out a .45mm pistol from his backpack and calmly placed it near his temple. He could not hear the screams and commotion and fear and confusion.    “The Sun is shining so brightly today,” he mused, and pulled the trigger, a thick jet of blood expelling itself onto the dirt. He slumped over and died.

After waiting for what seems like an eternity he thinks he has been duped and leaves the barn. No sooner does he leave a bright light flashes inside the barn. He quickly returns to find everyone gone. He goes the next day to return the tickets and the travel place is gone. Does this sound familiar to anybody? I can't think of the title or the author.
