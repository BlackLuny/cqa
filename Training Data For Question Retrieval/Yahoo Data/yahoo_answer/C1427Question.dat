20090129084520AAUQLGw	Social Science;Psychology	How do I assure my psychologist she doesn't have to worry that I will committ suicide without stopping cutting?	I'm not really sure what to do. I recently started seeing a counselor at the beginning of the summer and in dealing with some sexual abuse issues for the first time I felt really overwhelmed. I felt like I was losing control because for the first time since I can remember I was allowing myself to feel. I tried to put control back into my life by restricting my intake (bad idea I know) and that got a little out of hand so in trying to get control over that my cutting became more frequent (at least every other day). My counselor at the college I attend doesn't know that I cut but she did refer me to a psychologist after I lost 120 pounds in 5 months. (I was 285--now I'm 160) I told my new counselor about my cutting (mistake again) and now she won't get off of it. She is constantly saying how concerned she is that I'm going to kill myself. How do I help her understand that I'm not  trying to kill myself but that this is just something that works for me right now. She also keeps asking me to show her--Isn't that a little off--I mean why would I want to show anybody? I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie to my psychologist and tell her that I've stopped cutting if I haven't but I also want her to see me as someone she doesn't have to worry about because I don't want to have to stop going there. My counselor and psychologist are the only 2 people I have to talk to about stuff like this and if my college counselor finds out she'll have to report it because of the college's policy. My psychologist has said she might have to tell my counselor if I can't stop but I can't and don't think I want to. I don't want to lose either support person and don't know what to do. Can you help?

If a majority of people did this, how would the economy be affected?        a.The economy would suffer because less money would be spent on goods and services.      b.The economy would prosper because their investment funds would be available for businesses.      c.There would be no effect because the same amount of money would enter the economy.      d.The economy would suffer because the government would collect fewer income taxes.
20090129093547AAWP70V	Social Science;Psychology	I suddenly feel very lost in life? (mature responses only please)?	I'd just like a bit of advice I guess. I'm 18 years old, very nearly 19. Around New Years a year ago, I came to the realisation I'd be turning 18 very soon, and that really made me evaluate my life & current situation. I decided to really let my hair down, quit worrying and just really enjoy what's left of my teenagehood. I was quite unhappy at the time and hating college (UK - not university, last 2 years of high school) so this new outlook really turned my life around. I chose happiness, I started going out there and getting what I wanted, my social network expanded hugely and I pretty much partied, socialised, and had a lot of fun. It was the best year of my life so far with so many life changing experiences.       Recently somethings changed. I don't feel that "flow" anymore. My "energy" (without getting too spiritual here) feels like it's jammed or something. I just suddenly feel lost. Whereas before I was just loving every single minute of life, I'm suddenly pretty bored with life. I feel like I need a change, somethings gotta give, but I don't know what. A lot of my friends are at uni now, but I'm not, I started working, but after about 4 months lost my job a few weeks ago. I'd be tempted to look for another one, but I kind of don't want to, infact a large part of me wants to pack up and go travelling and finally escape this city I'd never really, until last year, felt at all happy in.       I know this is long, and vague, but I didn't want to ramble on forever. If you could offer any advice on ANYTHING I'd really appreciate it. I need it right now. =)

20090129094043AAeZKSC	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can anyone explain to me the meaning of this dream and why I ended up choking?	Ok so this morning I had a really strange dream. I dreamt that a woman, who was friends with my mom many years ago, came by and told us that we have to go to a funeral somewhere at the countryside. [just a comment, last month I found out that she might have cancer but we aren't close at all, we just know each other] She kept on insisting to bring all kinds of pies and stuff because the family of the deceased was very poor. I didn't know who was that person who died but we went to that funeral. Next thing I know, I'm with my dad at the cemetery and we were talking about how beautiful the cemetery is. It looked really nice with all kinds of trees and it was a dark atmosphere.After that, something happened and it got really dark and I felt evil all around us.      My dad started to pray "Our Father" and it passed for a couple of seconds. Then it got dark again and a guy with a skeleton on his face came from a door and he was saying a very different and changed "Our Father" prayer , against us. I started to pray too louder and louder and went towards him hoping that we will win but it got harder and harder to pray and I started to get very far away from my dad.       So I reached out and grabbed his shirt and then a message appeared from him that said "Keep praying, and don't forget that you are holding my shirt" It was a bit longer but this is all I remember from the message.It's like we were trapped inside an illusion or something. Anyway, the weirdest part is that I woke up choking and I could hardly breathe, it took me a couple of minutes to recover, it's like I was drowning. or something was holding my neck.After that I went back to sleep and also had some weird dreams and I remember one in which my mom had a really big belly and I thought she was pregnant but she told me that she isn't and I told her to go to the doctor but she didn't want to. I was so worried in the dream about her. Maybe this is because I worry a lot when I hear that some people I know have cancer. I hate this disease.      But still, I don't understand why I woke up choking.And this is not the first time it happens. It happened again some time ago, I dreamt I was in a room or something and it felt really evil and bad and it happened very similar with the cemetery, a fight with evil which resulted in choking.

20090129113218AA41Ff7	Social Science;Psychology	Did bad experience in highschool cause this?	am trying to figure out what happened to me that makes me not talk to married or taken men at all. Aquaintance business wise yes but friends no.      I am friends with women who are married but I rarely talk to their husbands. They(the women who are married) even know about this. And fine with it!      Anyway the only thing that I could come up with is back in highschool I set up my two best friends together. Well the guy friend started taking me out on all his dates and jokingly flirt with me in front of her. Then he told me that he cheated on her with someone else. And I was the one that had to tell her. Her and all of her friends thought I was the one that broke them up. That I was in love with him which I wasn't. I never did anything inappropriate with him.      They were 17 and 16 at the time and I was 18-19(graduating) and I didn't reach puberty until age 23 because of a disease.      This incident in highschool, could that be the cause of not talking to taken or married men? Even if my single guy friends get married or get a girlfriend I stop talking to them all together.    My reasoning is to avoid misunderstanding.   I'm no longer friends with those people in highschool.

The teaching of the theory of evolution in pre-college classes has been debated since the 1920s.  Since that time, the theory has been expanded considerably and evidence for both microevolution and macroevolution continues to mount.  Despite the scientific evidence, some feel that the place for teaching about evolution resides only in colleges and universities.        What do you think?

I asked her why she didn't tell me and she said it was because she knew it would make me sad. She then went on to say that she knew I really wanted a child and that it was just not the right time to have one.       But for some odd reason deep down I do agree with her. She is right that we are not in the good financial situation to provide for a child. I'm not angry or sad anymore and I am not anrgy at her either. I just feel somewhat empty. Why am I feeling like this?

Last night i had one of the weirdest yet. I was visiting my inlaws and they happened to live in a house on a hillside overlooking a large city. In my dream a horrendous earthquake struck. the house came sliding off its foundation slid down the hill them flew off the hill through the air(much like a ski jump) and straight into a tall building under construction. The house landed inside and was still somewhat in tact and non of us was seriously injured. A bunch of people from the city took refuge inside this building too.    Heres the funny part. My inlaws live out in the sticks no where near a major city. I do live in a seismic area but earthquakes have never bothered me much.

20090128092304AAe7whe	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do people confuse chivalry and good manners?	Chivalry seems to be more of a specific way for men to treat women. Open doors, pull out chairs, take off jackets, pay for dates...things that if you didn't do for other men, you wouldn't be considered as impolite. In fact, taking another guy's jacket off for him will earn you 'the eyebrow'.   Further, chivalry doesn't seem reciprocal in the way that politeness is. Its sort of an 'entitlement'. Women aren't expected to pay chivalrous acts back. However, if someone repays your politeness with rudeness or even mere indeference, you desist, and PDQ!      I personally think that there's a big difference, but I'm open to correction. Its why im here, innit?

20090128092817AAKmzOp	Social Science;Psychology	Do you ever feel inadequate?	I'm 25 years old, finishing my university degree, however, sometimes I feel like inadequate to others.  I feel as though most of the time I say or do things that make people question my intelligence.  I know based on my test scores that I'm not a moron, but why do I instantly regret my actions or words.        I'm probably being really hard on myself and completely misjudging other peoples thoughts about me.  How do I learn to be more confident with myself and learn to be self-aware and self-regulating.  Practice I suppose, thinking before I act and say.      Does anyone feel like this too, or am I completely alone on this?      For instance, today I had a meeting at a hotel with a group from school.  We met in the lobby with a coordinator for a group project we are doing. I wasn't familiar with the area but I drove myself.  As we were leaving, I guess the hotel had a separate entrance for entering and leaving the hotel, so I drove out the wrong way, but I don't recall it being adequately marked with signs.  There was a sign that I did notice, but it appeared, or so I thought that it was guiding people to a bank that shares the same parking lot.  It's snowing like crazy here right now, so visibility is decreased substantially.  The people from my group project saw me make this mistake and now I feel completely stupid.  It's a stupid incident but I just need to know if I'm the only one.
20090129121206AAwdeJ0	Social Science;Psychology	What can I do when it's too loud for me to concentrate during a test?	I was trying to take an exam today and I just could not concentrate. It's not that people were talking or anything, but I could hear the girl sitting next to me's pencil scraping her paper as she was filling in the bubbles. I feel like that wouldn't bother most people, but it was really hard for me to tune that out!      I've had problems with this before too. Like, I was taking an algebra test and the sound of the person sitting next to me tapping away on their calculator was too much for me. It's like when I'm taking a test, every little sound is magnified x1000 and it's really hard for me to keep focused.      I also can't stand when people bring laptops to class. I know it's much easier to take notes on a computer, but the sound of 30+ people clicking the keys on their keyboards drives me nuts. It's like I can't even hear the professor sometimes.      What can I do so that I'll be able to focus during tests and drown out all the annoying sounds I hear? I feel like it's not normal for someone to be so bothered by everyday classroom sounds that they can't even take a test. I'm frustrated.

20090129113622AAcr0lt	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	T_T What does my nightmare mean? Please help?	Three things you should know: I abbreviated peoples names to single letters in case one of them sees this. Im in high school, but please still take me seriously. I always carry around a journal / book of complete randomness with me.    ***    I was somewhere with a green floor that appeared to be fake grass. Somewhere with the atmosphere of a talk show, but the only other people I was aware of was the psychologist host, and some blurry ghost-like guy standing more towards the middle of the stage. The host looked like my psychology teacher, ironically. She was talking to me about some thing or another, but the only part of the conversation I can remember is her saying something about how I mispronounce certain words, park specifically, because of the   misgivings of traumatic childhood experiences and that I subconsciously "wish to keep remembering" so-called experiences. What she said offended me very much, though now Im not sure why.    I was suddenly in a very unfamiliar place. It was cold, and I felt surrounded by metal beams, which lined the walls and ceiling. It gave me the feeling of either a deserted college, or a deserted factory. I was waiting by the door, but when I saw C.s car pull up I went outside. (C is my math tutor by the way.) He and his girlfriend got out of the car, but to my knowledge C. doesnt even have a girlfriend. She reminded me a lot of my mom for some strange reason, but she was taller than me. Do you want a ride home? she asked, but C. said something like, No, we have to go. He grabbed her hand and started to turn back to his car. Wait. I need a ride. I said quietly. C. finally looked at me, smirking because I had said exactly what he wanted me too. Really? Maybe you should have been a little nicer to me before?    Then I was at school, in the only class my friend E's has with me. We were casually talking, when K. walked into the room. K. is friends with E. and myself. She walked up to us and I said Hey. But she didnt appear to notice. She picked up my journal and started looking through it casually. I didnt mind as my friends do that all the time, though K. herself is not usually interested. She didnt stay long, and took my journal with her when she left, which I found odd. Then I noticed there werent any other people in the room besides E. At lunch time, I found K. with A. in their usual spot. Hey you guys, wheres that book? I asked cheerfully. What book? K. said. I didnt know what to do. I went to E.s table and told her I thought that K. lost my book. E. cynically replied, She looses everything. But E. hadnt seen it around either so I had to look for it on the floors of the hallways. Usually the hall monitors dont allow us to wander the halls during lunch, but I didnt care. I could never find it, but I didnt have much time to look.    When I woke up I immediately thought of that image that had flashed through my mind at the beginning of the school year, (I guess you could call it a vision. Hard to explain how it had felt. Definitely not a normal daydream), of myself literally blowing out like the flame of a candle. Thats how I know this dream must be important.

20090128095929AARqXIE	Social Science;Psychology	It is extremely hard for me to be social. How do I change this?	I'm a 17 year old guy still in high school. I consider myself to be a loner because I like my own company sometimes. But I've been alone all throughout high school. All of this isolation has had a negative effect on me. Now I've become depressed and socially anxious. I've also had tons of family problems that contributed to this, but I won't get into it. Now I'm almost out of high school with no friends or anybody to talk to.    Back in grade school, all of the other kids really pissed me off. They were all so superficial and hating each other for the stupidest crap. Those people are still in my high school and they haven't changed much. Even some of the geeky kids piss me off. Some of them are extremely annoying or some of them have this attitude like they are better than everyone else simply because they are different. I knew this one kid in my grade 9 gym class who nobody liked. We had to pick partners for badminton. I felt bad because nobody picked him, so I offered to be his partner. Well, he sucked at the game and so did I. Throughout the game, he kept criticizing me and telling me how to do it correctly. I found out that day why nobody liked him.    It's been hard for me to find people that I like. With the anxiety, it makes it a whole lot harder. Even when I do somehow make a connection with someone, I become very insecure and it's harder for me to stay connected. I wish I could be in classes full of people that I liked. Often, I'm stuck with people I really don't like. When the majority of those people are there, I don't even want to try to communicate.  I dont know if Ill ever be able to communicate comfortably. How am I going to change this?
20090128102630AAdbUjB	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Odd part of a dream... I cut my thumb and tasted the blood...?	In a dream I was in the company of an old girlfriend, we where talking sitting at a cafe style table outside in day time, bit cloudy, in a old European cobble stoned water side terrace. I am cutting an apple. While attempting to cut a halve into a quarter the knife slipped through the apple and sliced the tip of my right thumb tip. Not alot but a good nick which made it bleed. I sucked the tip and tasted blood. I woke up and my thumb tip actually hurt as if it was cut, I had to check to make sure it was not. It was not but really felt like it was.       What is the significant meaning, if any?

20090128111108AAuXTxL	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can you tell me what these dreams mean?	Dream 1) There is a boy around the age of 14 who is standing on top of a hill in the middle of a war battle. The war is more like around the time of the revolutionary war though, not like a modern war. The boy is dressed in modern day clothes though. He has short spikey black hair. Then the boy gets shot in the heart. He collapses. After that my dream goes into a living room. It has a huge white drape in the middle. (like for when you get proffesional pictures) There is a black coffin on the drape. It's open and the boy is in it, but there is no wound from where he was shot. Then the boy rises up out of the coffin, but he's still in the coffin. It's like there's two of him, one alive and one dead. He walks away. My dream moves into a school hallway. I'm in this part. I'm in a disguise. I'm dressed up as the boy. I think he's my brother( in the dream) but I'm not sure. I pass the boy in the hallway and start freaking out, so does everyone else when they see there are two of us. My dream ends back in the living room. I'm in the disguise looking into the coffin where I see the dead boy.      Dream 2) This one is short. I'm standing on the top of my stairs and jump off. I start flying. I go into our dining room, then my kitchen. When I get into my family room there are two monsters in it. I think they're my older brother and sister. (my brother and sister are 10 years older than me and don't live with me)       I've had both these dreams periodically for as long as I can remember. I think they started when I was 4-6. I'm 14 now. I haven't had one in a while, but I still remember them so vividly.

Because in the past friends have said I've had a good singing voice whilst boys have heard me singing quietly at parties with my friends have said rude comments. My school does a christmas and spring show every year and students sing in front of parents and pupils. I'd love to sing but I don't have the self confidence to do it let alone sing in front of a singing teacher. I've had dreams about it. How can I want something so bad when I don't have the strength to do it??
20090128100821AAlR8Iy	Social Science;Psychology	Interpret my dream PLEASE?	So, for the past week or so, i've been having the same dream.  I need help interpreting it.      In my dream, i'm standing on the piece of floor, a small circular section of ground that is revolving slowly. I can't seem to move, but i can speak. People i know and people i don't know are standing there, and on the outside are people in white robes.  I start calling to them and they look at me in confusion. I see an unborn child, a fetus, floating in midair, and one of the robed figures walks up to it and slashes it in midair with a sword. No one seems to notice and i start screaming as the robed figures move as one, killing my friends and family mercilessly. No one seems to notice until they are attacked and no one else seems to notice that either.  I am screaming and screaming and the people still alive just stare at me as if im crazy.  One of my best friends walks up to me and puts his hands on my shoulders and shakes me, saying, "Wake up wake up everything is fine!" And then his face changes, its painful and blood spills from his mouth.  A see the tip of the sword as it pushes through his gut and he falls, lifeless, at my feet. I still can't move. Then everything fades to black, and im still rotating. There's this thing there, all black save for  a bony hand with long savage fingers and a face, if you could call it a face. Its more like skin stretched over what could be a face, but no eyes and no shape of a nose. Then it revolves out of sight. When i turn around a gain, its three inches from me, and i can see that its hand is dripping with blown blood, and i somehow know its the blood of the rotting corpse of the friend who died at my feet.  I scream but i find my mouth is sewn together, and the scream tears the skin through and i taste my own blood. I'm choking on it as the thing retracts. Then it starts moaning, kind of a low whirring sound, and my skin crawls as its hand reaches towards me slowly. I can't move, i can't escape. i can only scream a bloodcurdling scream. It is at that point that i sit up in bed, covered in a cold sweat, and wonder what this dream means. Please help me figure it out. Maybe if i know what it means it will go away.

20090128100908AAN7U0s	Social Science;Psychology	Why would a man who cheated on you repeatedly feel no remorse?	Denial? Delayed reaction? Ever going to change?

20090128102101AA63Stn	Social Science;Psychology	How do writers organize in formation in the article? what purpose do you think they had in mind with this stru?	Monday 9:30 a.m. It's time for a frank talk. And no, it can't wait. We know, we know: Most of you are sick to death of blogs. Don't even want to hear about these millions of online journals that link together into a vast network. And yes, there's plenty out there not to like. Self-obsession, politics of hate, and the same hunger for fame that has people lining up to trade punches on The Jerry Springer Show. Name just about anything that's sick in our society today, and it's on parade in the blogs. On lots of them, even the writing stinks.       Go ahead and bellyache about blogs. But you cannot afford to close your eyes to them, because they're simply the most explosive outbreak in the information world since the Internet itself. And they're going to shake up just about every business—including yours. It doesn't matter whether you're shipping paper clips, pork bellies, or videos of Britney in a bikini, blogs are a phenomenon that you cannot ignore, postpone, or delegate. Given the changes barreling down upon us, blogs are not a business elective. They're a prerequisite. (And yes, that goes for us, too.)       There's a little problem, though. Many of you don't visit blogs—or haven't since blogs became a sensation in last year's Presidential race. According to a Pew Research Center Survey, only 27% Some newer numbers: According to Forrester, 11.2% of online adults in the U.S. publish a blog at least once a month. Of the same group, 24.8% read a blog and 13.7% comment on a blog at least once a month. The numbers are higher for youths. Of online youths, 20.8% publish a blog, 36.6% read a blog, and 26.4% comment on a blog at least once a month. But I suspect the numbers are unreliable because many mainstream sites with millions of readers—celebrity site TMZ and gadget sites like Gizmodo—are actually blogs. But are all the readers aware of this? I doubt it. This is the blurring of the blog/mainstream divide, a theme we'll see again and again in these revisions. of Internet users in America now bother to read them. So we're going to take you into the world of blogs by delivering this story—call it Blogs 101 for businesses—in the style of a blog. We're even sprinkling it with links. These are underlined words that, when clicked, carry readers of this story's online version to another Web page. This all may make for a strange experience, but it's the closest we can come to reaching out from the page, grabbing you by the collar, and shaking you into action.       First, a few numbers. There are some 9 million blogs out there, Yes, there were 9 million, but how many of them were active? Probably only a fraction. In early 2008, says Technorati Chairman David Sifry, the search company indexes 112 million blogs, with 120,000 new ones popping up each day. But only 11% of these blogs, he says, have posted within the past two months. That means the active universe is closer to 13 million blogs. Kevin Burton, CEO of FeedBlog, argues that the number should be lower, from 2 million to 4 million blogs. with 40,000 new ones popping up each day. Some discuss poetry, others constitutional law. And, yes, many are plain silly. "Mommy tells me it may rain today. Oh Yucky Dee Doo," reads only one April Posting. Let's assume that 99.9% are equally off point. What we didn't see in early 2005 was the advent of the spam blog. These blogs, produced automatically, are designed to show up in search results and to attract Google advertisements known as Adsense. Sifry estimates that fully 99% of the blog posts reaching search engines are spam. So what? That leaves some 40 new ones every day that could be talking about your business, engaging your employees, or leaking those merger discussions you thought were hush-hush.

My guy best friend (whom I'm attracted to romantically, and who I am hoping will develop the same feelings toward me!) has recently seen the following two dreams:      1. I was dancing around him naked, totally un-selfconscious. He was trying to get me to cover up, because there were some other people around as well, but I would not listen and kept on dancing that way!      2. He and I were having a normal, everyday conversation while he was having a shower, naked. Neither of us was feeling weird or self -conscious. Only once, when I looked down at him, he suddenly felt shy!      Can u give me ur thoughts on what these 2 dreams probably mean? Thanks! :-)
