gaXUIduMaa	Drugstore or a Pharmacy?  On the drugstore all you need are the usual licenses, including liquor if you sell that too.  For a pharmacy, you need to have a registered pharmacist on board and would probably need to add some extra security measures but that is not required by law.

Bz0niDHlaa	they are everywhere in camden<br>  there is one stall, when you come out of the station turn right and it's one of the first few shops there, it has a lot of necklaces and hair bows and tutus and there is often a girl with bright pink hair in there<br>  do not go to the shop tho which has loads of things on the front, including tutus, and says it specialises in metal band things, the people in there force you to look at stufff and it takes ages to get out

4RjM5lElaa	I found the most reasonable folks in town for re-keying were Pop A Lock.  They are nice, prompt and don't, cost an arm and a leg - give them a call - they are in the phone book and have several locations - tell them your issue and have them give you a quote - it might shave a few bucks off if you are willing to travel to their office so offer that up if that is an option for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D6t6SoFRaa	Taking it to a locksmith shop and having it rekeyed is the cheapest route: $10-$20 depending on the lock and the area.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I may have some details that may be able to help you, but I notice you don't allow for emails. Would you be able to email me and I could then send you the info.<br>  My husband was made redundant 4 weeks ago, he had not received a wage from his employer for four weeks prior to that (he was paid weekly) and was told like you that he would not be receiving any more monies from the employer for hours worked or holidays owed. He too had worked a full shift before being told this. He has just completed a form that pays for wages holidays and I think redundancy monies owed but I cannot remember the name of the place. If you send me your email I can get the name and send you the details or get my husband to email you back.<br>  Hope this helps and congratulations on your new arrival.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  <br>  Hi my husband says this is what you will need to complete  to enable you to claim any unpaid wages/redundancy/holidays owed:  <a href="http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/pdfs/RP1%20Form%20revised%20Feb07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/pdfs/RP1%20...</a><br>  <br>  Also check this link: <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/employment/redundancy/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/employme...</a><br>  <br>  Even though you can download the RP1 form to complete it yourself, if a company goes insolvent the appointed liquidators by law have to contact all employees once the company has gone into liquidation with there details so that the RP1 form can be returned to the liquidators. This process can take several weeks (as we are finding out) and it can take upto about 3 months before you may receive any outstanding monies owed by your employer. <br>  <br>  This link allows you to check online whether the company that you worked for has gone into liquidation or has applied to go into liquidation: <a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/d30a385e48e055ae5dff6b41e8df9a00/wcframe?name=accessCompanyInfo" rel="nofollow">http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/d30a38...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this information proves helpful and I wish you good luck for the future.
hmZwWZibaa	Had problems like this before. Depending on what state you live in, call your local towns person or search your yellow book, or on google ups center or ups business. They should have a phone number and help you with the situation. They will let you come pick it up =]

WlYnuBXxaa	yes, i know a little about the sherman house my dad's wife use to live there.<br>  now it is a non smoking building and the rent is based on your income,<br>  yes that part of town does flood! <br>  the only draw back that i can see is that parking for the building is across the street near the river and i know that does flood.<br>  if you are disabled in anyway or elderly it maybe hard to get your groceries from the parking lot to the building parking out front is very hard and you can't be there for long without getting a ticket.<br>  i hope this information helps take care and God Bless
kXjwAYh4aa	hollister is my favorite store they have very like beach kind of clothes there expensive and some people say its not worth it but it is to me so try it!|`|FaOmMOdsaa	well honestly, it's only okay.  If you wear smaller than a size 7 pant size, then you can shop there, any bigger and you're wasting money.  <br>  <br>  Given, they have some cute stuff there, but is it really worth it compared to shops such as American Eagle or Forever 21?  Not really.  Hollister is a beach style type of clothing, very casual, and NOT made to last.  Their clothing is designed for supermodel bodies, tall, and size zero preferably.  So before you go in and buy something, keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! =]

7fe1d2bb017a1b7ab229dde0350616eeaa	You need to take drivers ed online, there are thousands of courses you can take online for not more then about $100. Theres a lot of information in them, but its important to know before you take your permit test. A lot of people mistake the permit test for the driving test, DO NOT WORRY IF YOU'VE NEVER TOUCHED THE WHEEL OF A CAR BEFORE. The permit test is a written test that you take after you've completed the whole course online and they will send you a certificate, then you have to sign up for a driving school, ( a trained professional that will teach you the basics of driving) so now you will have two certificates that prove you have signed up for driving school and completed the online course. Then you take it into the DMV and you take the written test which comes easy for some people but don't worry if you fail, its the most failed test in the world, and you can go back in a week and take it again. good luck!
