20090225111748AAqjPsb	Dining Out;United States;Washington, D.C.	Are you legally allowed to drink alcohol on your 21st birthday in the District of Columbia?	On my 21st birthday (February 24) I went to dinner at a restaurant in DC with my friends and family and ordered a glass of wine. When the server looked at my ID, he consulted his manager and they told me that they could not legally serve me alcohol until midnight (at which time it would technically be February 25, the day after my birthday). In addition to being humiliated, I believe he was wrong. I have never heard of anyone having to wait until the day AFTER their 21st birthday to drink alcohol.

20090225121959AAxPMWw	Dining Out;Fast Food	Is McDonald's a decent first job?	I'm 17, and I'm really just looking for some money. I have a McDonald's right behind my house that I know will hire me just because they need the help. I'm not too picky, I really just need some money right now. I've never had a job before either. I've filled out other applications, but I really have nothing to put down because I've never worked before. Also I'm homeschooled until I graduate in a few months, so I think I could get some pretty good hours and talk to them about it.  And they don't drug test that I know of so that's always a plus. For those of you that are against cannabis for some biased ignorant reason, don't be rude. I was just wondering if this would be a decent starter job.
