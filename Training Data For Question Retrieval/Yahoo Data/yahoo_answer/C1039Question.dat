20090307023945AAzxdrV	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Fergie admits retirement fear?	Ferguson had previously announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2001/02 season before performing a U-turn to continue his association with the Red Devils.      He has subsequently added a string of further honours to the Old Trafford trophy cabinet and has enjoyed over 22 years at the United helm.      Speculation persists as to when the 67-year-old will eventually decide to relinquish the reins of the Premier League leaders and he acknowledged he assesses the situation on an annual basis.      However, the Scot also revealed the three factors which will determine when is the right time to step down, despite outlining his concerns about retiring.      "When I reached 60, I asked myself the question," Ferguson told L'Equipe. "I almost left.       "But I quickly realised, with my family, that it was a mistake. Today, I fear the idea of retiring.       "I have been on the train for so long that when I get off I fear my system will collapse.       "I have decided not to ask myself the question any more.       "Three things can make me stop. 1. My health. 2. If I don't take pleasure any more. 3. If I don't have the strength for new challenges any more.       "Each summer, I have a look at those three things. I go to my doctor first. I had a pacemaker set up four or five years ago.       "Today, I am playing the penalty shoot-out of my managerial career. I know that. The rest is decided between me and me.       "I see my doctor every summer. He says 'boss, you are 67. You will have more and more back pains. Getting up in the morning sometimes won't be easy'.      "This is the penalty shoot-out."      farewell Fergie, you will be missed.

Michelle McCool is nothing shes boring she cant wrestle that good, she cant do promos, she cant talk on the mic, and the fans dont even like her thats way before she turned heel.  WWE need to save money and release Michelle McCool as shes not entertaining

20090307013829AACvrJk	Sports;Tennis	Don't you think Federer should not have used illness and back problem excuses last year?	The great Aussie player, Roy Emerson, once said: “If you’re hurt, don’t play. If you play, you’re not hurt. There are no excuses.” The author of this article then writes: "Surely Federer believes in this code. Surely he heard it as a teen when he was coached by an Aussie, Peter Carter. Yet now Federer has given himself a public, sanctified excuse — a reason for past losses this year to Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, as well as a cloud of concern that will cover him for several weeks. Why he would do this is something I find mystifying, disturbing and, yes, downright unfair". Also he writes - "why would he dare insult the sport’s code of sportsmanship by going public with news of his illness? It was nauseating to me to see Federer stand alongside the great Roy Emerson Monday night..."   Federer, as I have said many times before, is an unpleasant character, and I'm glad that more members of the press and tennis fans are realizing this.   Here is the article: (the latter part of the 1st half is what counts)   http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2008-03-17...

I've watched all of NZ 7's games in the current season and the prvious years and after watching a average Wales squad beat us i think it is time for new vision and direction.  My concern in the current NZ Team is, "where is the out and out speedsters"???  It is true, "don;t fix what's not broken" my question is how long do you wait to fix it when it is broken.  Rushie to take top job.  He has a lot of Tiech in him but also has a great understanding of touch football where you have to beat a player with the pass and ball speed.  I don;t know if he is or is not but maybe someone like Peter Walters (Mr Touch) to be an advisor of some sort!!! My thoughts anyway!!      Interested for comments!

20080927185931AAQtWBw	Sports;Football (American)	True or False : "Every Game Matters" in college football.?	If "Every Game Matters" how come , for the past 2 years , there have been crazy weekends and upsets and upheaval within the polls. People , if the college football regular season really was the playoff like so many people claim , wouldn't you be finished after 1 loss? What kind of playoff allows you to lose one , even two games and puts you in the national championship?       Every game doesn't matter. I think what we see today with all these upsets just proves this point. Many of these teams aren't done yet and could still make the championship game if they get their stuff together the rest of the way. So how is the regular season a playoff?       It's not. I think Wetzel put it better in his column , go read it on the Yahoo Sports site.

20090307010739AAeWxf2	Sports;Cricket	Is Sehwag the most CONSISTENTLY destructive player to have played international cricket?	I think YES. Note the use of the word consistently. Sehwag's career strike rate in ODI cricket is 100.92. The people with career SR greater than him all have a much lower average i.e. they are not as consistently destructive. In terms of Test cricket, the only person with a better SR than him is Gilchrist. But still Sehwag is more consistently destructive in Test cricket. Consider the fact that he is an opener (i.e. bats in tougher conditions) and he is the only person to have made a triple century in less than 300 balls. Moreover he has made two triple centuries (only the Don and Lara have achieved this, and neither clobbered as much as Sehwag does). Overall he is one of the few players that all bowlers dread bowling to in today's game.

20070519051304AAxXrLr	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Fantasy Baseball Trade?	Just out of curiosity, would it be a good idea to trade Barry Bonds and Barry Zito for Cliff lee, Brandon Webb, and David Wright?      Statistically I am way ahead on Home Runs, Bonds walks a ton, and I'm dead-last in strikeouts.      I have Chipper and Upton to play 3rd already, but have Beltran, Tori Hunter, and Sizemore in the OF.      My starting pitching isn't so great, Zito, Verlander, Meche, Blanton, Glavine, Javier Vasquez, and Freddy Garcia. I have Rich Harden on the DL, hopefully coming back soon.      I see Cliff Lee as a direct replacement for Zito, and Webb is a pretty good pitcher. Wright hasn't hit his stride yet, but Bonds draws a ton of walks plus an insane OBP. The downside of Bonds is he takes more days off and he's injury-prone.      Any advice?

20090306170204AAKzQL1	Sports;Martial Arts	Has there ever been someone in your life that you just really (I mean really) want to mess up?	Read whole thing.Okay. I used to be this guys friend. Actually this last summer. But while we were friends, he convinced my little brother to steal a bike from a public pool and he told him that he would fix it up and know one would know. But the owner found out and he convinced my little brother to take the rat for it and I let it go. I knew about the whole thing and I didn't prevent it and that's my wrong and I'm not proud of it. He also turned me against one of my best friends by lying about him to me while he was gone in El Paso. He's always thought he was cool and popular but 1.He's a total white trash punk and 2.His only friends are the loser skater kids. Imagine a skinny skater kid with short redish hair and big bug eyes that thinks he's funny when he acts like and *** hole. Nobody even laughs at his jokes and it's pathetic. But he always told me, "if you hang out with me, you'll be more popular". I didn't ever buy into that crap because everyone's always liked me. So one day we got in an argument. He's always thought that I should be his little posy and I should let him treat me like his b**ch. So I got tired of it and told him off and that I'm taking any of his crap. So he THINKS, he has a right to defend himself on that one and before I got the nerve to just deck him in the jaw, I decided to go check on my old friend that I talked about earlier. Turns out that I became friends with him again. I haven't been the punks friend since then. But sometimes he'll talk with my little brother and tell him how much of a loser i am at school and that i don't talk to anybody. Which is bull because he sees me every day and he himself know that's not true. He's just a punk. He thinks hes the coolest kid in school but the only people he hangs out with are skater fags. And theyre not that popular. He's disrespected my whole family (including my mother), messed with our house, talks too much crap. He's not that normal person just have a little grudge on. I HATE everything about him. His face, his voice, his walk, his posture, and his personality. I've never been violent......ever. I've had urges toward some people but have never acted them out. But this guy just makes me want to break him. He still makes comments to my brother about me. It's just the fact that he has this little fantasy that I 'm such a loser and he's so much cooler than me. But what gets me the most is the enormous amount of disrespect towards my family. I'm just waiting for that time when he's on my property (I live in Texas. It's law that if you feel threatened, you can take action) and he decides to flap his jaw and say the wrong thing because I'm not kidding, he wont be able to talk out of that mouth again. I know I can take him. I'm buffed out and he's this skinny punk. I don't have a big ego just to let you know. I'm just comparing size and composition. Has anyone ever felt that way about someone. Should I wait for that moment?

To: Cavs fans   Don't criticize it right away just because Mo Williams is involved in the deal. In this trade they get to trade Ben Wallace's big contract and receive an underrated star like B. Davis, who showed he can lead the point extremely well with the Warriors along with his underrated defense. He is only struggling with the Clips because of their supporting cast and chemistry, while Randolph has proven that he can still dominate scoring in the paint which would take the pressure off Illgauskas. While the Clips get a nice shooter out of Mo Williams along with Big Ben's expiring contract.

The only good news from that trade is that the Knicks didn't give up much in that deal, and don't say that the trade was meant to clear up salary cap. Because last I checked Tim thomas also only had a 2 yrs left, while Jerome James had an 1 yr. expiring contract.

Do you feel it's kinda sad to see them in perhaps the biggest match of both men legendary careers in a month from now? I said sad because, one way or another, I feel like after this match it's about time for maybe one or even both of them to leave the business.      Before u start ranting, hear me out first. It's not that I want them to retire, but u know, the day will eventually come when they will no longer there to entertain us when they retire. My point is, does anybody here feel like this match is the penultimate match for both legends?      They have accomplished everything to be accomplished n they are simply irreplaceable, no doubting that. Watching their match won't only bring joy for me, but also sadness, because you know, when men has accomplished everything to be accomplished, perhaps it's about time for them to go and move on with their lives, and so is ours.

This guy yes i know hes hurt bla bla bla last year but he's been out for all this time and recovered all this time and has pitched healthy 100% this spring. Why didn't he join Chinese Taipei and pitch for them? By doing so would have dramatically increased Chinese Taipei's chances in the WBC, maybe not the ENTIRE WBC, but certainly against korea/china. And why isn't Dodgers hybrid RP/SP Kuo playing for Chinese Taipei as well?

20090227130631AAM8lWz	Sports;Hockey	Soda pop Friday.  Can you answer these questions about hockey and fashion?	I got all girly and went on a clothing shopping spree while getting all juiced up on pop.        Can you answer these question relating to hockey and fashion?        1) Ovechkin put on sunglasses and a stupid hat during the All Star game.  Was this because he can’t shoot a puck when he is not wearing overly tinted glass in front of his eyes?  Yuck….yuck.       2) I am sure you guys remember Cooperalls came in a long plants version and a long shorts (or since we are talking 80’s….jams) version?  I saw a pair of Toronto Maple Leafs Darryl Sittler Game Worn (preseason) Cooperalls on E-bay selling for $4,200.  Ummmm, “Total rip-off” OR “What a Deal”?       3) If they started making jerseys for dogs, would you buy one for your pooch? If you do not have a dog…..why not….do you not like dogs?  Don’t want the responsibility?        4) If they sold something called a “4th jersey” for autograph signings, public appearances, and whatnot……and they sold for half the price of regular jerseys……would more people buy them……OR do people like to stick to the standard home or away jersey, no matter the cost?        5) Most NHL teams have dangle earrings that girls can purchase.  Really think about it:  If you see a chick wearing NHL earrings is that tacky?  Why or why not?       6) Name 2 reasons why you should NEVER wear flip-flops to a hockey game?      Please note:  I asked all of these without bringing up Don Cherry or Avery *pats self on back*

Like I go to the BMX racing track and you know they turn up wearing moto X gear full face helmets goggles and they have like cruddy little BMX bikes I mean if they want to have an MX type bicycle get a mountain bike, and the track has to be soooo perfect because thats all the bmx bikes can go on, they have to carve out the shape etc etc with MX you just need to chuck a heap of dirt thier and the bike carves it out itself, And they all think thier sooo good but thier real Fa*gs and they will never make it anywhere, I think bmx racing is just for people who cant afford a dirtbike and I think BMX bikes are good for skate parks not dirt tracks, they dont use mountain bikes on BMX tracks cuz thier too hard to controll well maby if they had some muscels they would be able to, I hate how they pretend to be MX riders AND Bmx started from some kids pretending to be moto X riders (fact) I have a real problem with it

Plus he pronounces his name like "Steffin" instead of "Steven".  Yecchhh.  I'm drafting Meeks.

Why is it that in their morning sequences it is always light out and like 9 or 10 AM when they're shooting deer? In around 5-6 years of hunting and getting to my stand or spot on the ground I have never seen a deer after 8 AM just walk around and moving, only if someone pushes them out of beds. Is it because the deer they hunt have a ton of food plots to choose from? I also know they need light for the camera, but it just seems too late in the morning for deer to be moving. I hunt on the east coast by the way. Our bow, rifle and muzzleloader seasons run from the beginning of october to the middle of december. With school I am in the woods 12-20 days per year (not counting turkey and bear seasons) with some after school evening hunts. Thanks.

However, I think that a lot depends on how Flintoff is bowling and whether Brett Lee is fit. I dont think there's too much between the batting, mayb Autrialia are slightly better but I definitely think they'll win it in the batting.

I recently tried to purchase a couple Browning Buckmark .22 pistols for target practice, only to be told by multiple dealers that they're not available in the warehouses across the entire East Coast. Not only Browning .22 pistols, but Ruger's, et al. as well.       What do you think is the reason for the dearth of .22 pistols? I can't imagine there is a politically motivated rush for plinking guns with 10 round magazines? Or have the manufacturers just stopped making "irrelevant" guns so they can focus on meeting the demand for guns that are more likely to be affected by the Obama administration?

20090307070222AANYUeM	Sports;Football (American)	Who will win the finals of my favorite NFL players playoff?	In this corner 6'2, weighing in at 205 pounds, was originally signed by the Packers in 1994 as an undrafted free agent, but went back to the Arena Football Leauge in '95, and returned to the NFL in '98 and was signed by the Rams, has the 3rd highest quarterback rating of all-time, with 94.3, trailing only Steve Young and Peyton Manning, also is the 2nd most accurate QB in NFL history, his back-up quarterback while he was on the Rams was Jake Delhomme, who now plays for the Carolina Panthers(who I do NOT like at all. LOL), and one of his wide recievers was Ricky Proehl, who soon thereafter played for the Panthers, in SB XXXIV, he led the Rams to a Super Bowl Victory, their first NFL championship in almost 50 years, and the next year, in 2001, he led the Rams to the Super Bowl YET AGAIN, but this time they lost to the Patriots, who would win 2 of the next 3 Super Bowls, then in 2004, he was released and picked up by the New York Giants for 2 years, and then in 2006, they released him, and he was signed by the Arizona Cardinals, and just this past season, he led the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl and their first NFL championship game in 62 years, Kurt Warner!      And in the left corner, I think he's about 6 feet tall, but I can't guess his weight just by looking at his face; LOL. What I mean is the Wikipedia article about him doesn't tell his weight or height. He started his NFL career in '79 with the 49ers and stayed with them for 14 YEARS, before signing with the Chiefs in 1993, and retiring in 1994, THE YEAR I WAS BORN! Thats a weird coincidence!(I HAD TO GOOGLE THAT WORD(coincidence) TO REMEBER HOW TO SPELL IT!!!! LOL.) In 1981, '84, '85, '87, and '89, he had the highest passer rating in the NFC, and in '87 and '89, he had the highest passer rating in the entire NFL. Known for his ability to stay calm under pressure, he led his teams to 31 4th-quarter comebacks. Two of those games were the 1981 NFC Championship game and SB XXIII. The GW-TD in SB XXIII WAS AT THE END OF A 92-YD DRIVE! The 49ers retired his #16 jersey in 1997 during halftime of a MNF game. He led the Chiefs to their first AFC championship game in JANUARY 1994, THE MONTH I WAS BORN! And most likely A WEEK AFTER I WAS BORN!!!!!! More WEIRD COINCIDENCES! Also in '94, he earned a spot on the NFL 75th anniversary All-Time team, and in 1999, the SportingNews editors chose him as the 3rd greatest football player of all-time, also in '99, ESPN named him the 25th greatest athlete of the 1900's, and in 2006, Sports Illustrated rated him the #1 clutch QB of all-time. Despite his success, he did not become the starting QB until halfway through the 1980 NFL season. He has the 4th Highest career passing rating with 92.3, and is the only player ever to win 3 Super Bowls, Joe Montana!   Pick who you think is better. First one to 5 votes will go to the final 4 of my favorite NFL-NBA-MLB-NHL players playoff!

20090307065829AA4pGiq	Sports;Boxing	Would changing how the late rounds are scored make boxing better?	First off, Friday Night Fights last night was a real treat for non-ppv boxing.  The last round of the second fight and main event were very exciting, and it got me thinking.      Would boxing matches be more interesting if the later rounds were somehow given more weight than the early rounds?  Maybe a 20 point must system in which 20-18 rounds are given for dominating rounds with no knockdowns?  Or Maybe clearly winning a late round earns a 10-8.5 round without having to dominate or score a knock down?      Sometimes I think about how a fighter barely wins the first round and gets a 10-9 round, then his opponent clearly wins the last round, and he gets a 10-9.  Clearly, the late round guy did a lot more to win his round, but they are weighted the same.      Should the championship rounds be pro-rated 1.5 times the worth of an early round?  Or maybe 1.25.

Here in Malaysia, the gap between a good player and a lousy one is pretty large. So when it comes to 1 on 1's I have no idea what to do. Should I guess it or use my reflexes to save it. I can use my reflexes to save most above average players. What can I do when the handball scores here in the school leagues are usually very low and all the pressure is on me to save these kind of shots?

It's middle school, so there's 6th, 7th, and 8th graders trying out.  I'm only in 6th grade!  Usually only 2 or 3 6th graders make the school teams.  Everyone is saying I'll make it, because I would say I'm the best in my grade.  I really really really wanna show people what I can do, but I'm scared!  And there's not even a JV team, just one!      So, what kind of preparation can I do?  I play pitcher, 3rd, and right field.  Well I definitely won't pitch in the game, because I'll be a 6th grader, so if I do make it they'll probably pick me for right field.  Oh by the way, 15 people make it.  I have a very strong arm, but sometimes it's not that accurate.  I'm great at catching pop-ups, so that's not a problem.  I sorta need help in grounders?!      AND HITTING!  I really need help in hitting!  When I practice at home, all I seem to do is swoop the bat.  How can I keep it more level?  I need help in like following my hips too.  What do I do?!  They're probably looking for girls who can really hit!      Oh and I have a dad, sister, and brother who can help me play.  My dad plays baseball, my sister plays softball and is 18, and my brother plays baseball and he's 15.  I come from a baseball/softball family.  And I go for private pitching lessons sometimes at this place.      Help me!  I really really really really really really really really really REALLY..... wanna make the team!

20090307055605AAOshzd	Sports;Basketball	Basketball captain...?	Hi,      My basketball team names captains for the next year at the banquet. I wasn't really expecting it anyways seeing my coach ripped me off in playing time because I didn't play my sophomore year due to torn ligaments in my foot, but he gave it to one girl who just whines all the time. I'm going to be a senior and he has two junior captains. All season this year he started the whiny girl (the coach is friends with her family). Meanwhile, the captains and all four of the other starters were telling him to start me. On top of not playing over girls I'm clearly better than, I could be doing indoor track and breaking school records.I think it's a slap in the face not being captain my senior year over two juniors due to his relations with her family. And it's not like I have a bad attitude or don't have leadership... I've been captain on my cross country team since sophomore year, I'm captain of my ASA Softball team, and I'm a junior captain on my varsity softball team. The whiny girl also has an older sister who played for this coach and I overheard her talking with one of her friends that her sister already talked to him about her being captain. I don't really mind that I'm not captain, but it frustrates me that a younger girl is because she sucks up to the coach and has her family help her, while ALL of my teamates are saying they're not going to listen to her and will listen to me. What does everyone else think?

Just started thinking, everyone is making this big deal about AI coming off the bench and he doesn't want to do this and do that, but Marbury is coming off of the bench and is totally embrasing his role. Granted he didn't play all year, but damn, I'd rather back up Rodney Stuckey and Rip hamilton than Rajon Rondo! They both need rings and I don't think Iverson off the bench will be a bad thing. It is a great thing! Just give the guy a chance like Marbury has gotten.

If anything, he could have hung for 1 minute, but for God's sakes Hunter, TAKE THE BEATDOWN AND SELL IT!!! Hunter is killing this storyline with his politics and unprofessionalism. On top of that, Hunter is a bad actor and overdid it on the drama. Foaming at the mouth, grabbing Orton's knee and falling out multiple times. Pathetic...      Why didn't they just have Orton punt him in side of the head last night?
