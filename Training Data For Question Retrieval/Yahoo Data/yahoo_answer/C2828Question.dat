20090304154742AAM2fQp	Dining Out;United States;New York City	Restaurant & etc. for Birthday in the City?	Well, its that time again for my birthday! This year is a big one, so my mom is allowing me to take some friends and sleep over in New York City (I live on Long Island). I was a planning to hang out in the Union Square area because my absolute favorite restaurant in the world, Max Brenner's, is there, and I really wanted to  take my friends there for dessert. But MB's is quite expensive, and I don't want to make my mom pay for an entire meal ticket for eight people (my mom and myself included) there. I would love to go to Craft, Tom Coliccio's restaurant, but it's waaayy too expensive. So, do you know of any really cool restaurants in the Union Square area or even down or uptown a little, (as long as it's not like 50 blocks) which aren't super expensive but are cool and have good food? I'm open to all food types, I especially like Japanese, though the restaurant would have to have cooked food as well as sushi.       The day of the trip is probably going to be in mid-April.       Thanks :)
