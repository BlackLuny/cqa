The earring feels like it's tight. So I changed the back to a butterfly back & now it seems like it feels looser. Is the butterfly back worse for it compared to the safety ones. (You know the ones that you push on & it clicks in and end of the stud is covered by it.)      Do you think it's infected because it's swollen so long after it's been pierced? Should I take out this stud & put in a GOLD hoop that I have to give it more room to heal?

20090304104811AAcqyxt	Beauty & Style;Hair	Can coloring your hair cause it to fall out?	I admit it, I'm addicted to coloring my hair! I love putting a new color every month or so using a home hair color kit. I like the thrill of changing the color, never knowing exactly what the color will turn out as. I'm currently on a red kick, and it's soo much fun watching people do double takes. But I've taken a lot of ribbing of the years, which kind of annoys the heck out of me.    The biggest and most popular comment "All that coloring is going to cause your hair to fall out!" To me this is ridiculous, my hair is quite healthy, soft and smooth. I don't use heat or products, I let it air dry, and I even use a conditioning treatments.    So will it really cause my hair to fall out? (I don't think so, but nobody believes me)   Oh another one is that it'll cause cancer. That one I know is wrong, that's why they put stoppers on the developing cream.

Well I went to a new salon that was supposed to do "perfect" eyebrows and it was not to mention really expensive and the first thing the lady does is wax off a line of hair off the tops of my brows and I have never had that done before. Now my eyebrows are too low on my face and when I make facial expressions I look funny cause the hair is missing from the tops of my brows and it's obvious  that hair should be there. I've heard that once you wax or pluck an eyebrow hair is may or may not grow back and now I'm constantly thinking about it and worrying that I'll have sh*tty eyebrows forever...    = ( Is it possible for my brows to grow back in a look as good as they did before this disaster???

I get the black heads and some red pimples.  I don't have a lot, most of it is on my nose.  But it USED TO BE TERRIBLE right when I was going through puberty.  So I have a few acne scars.  Would it get rid of the scars, do you think?  I'm 15, if that matters.  :]      How long does it take to start showing improvement?         Also....  My family is lower middle class, and I always feel bad about asking for things, so I rarely ever do.  Should I feel bad about asking my dad if he'll pay for this?  Because I kind of do, but I'm sick of my skin breaking out.      I always have at least three pimples, and I feel so unattractive.  How should I bring up the situation with my dad?    >.<

Would my results be permament?

20090227064726AARQ0oS	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help finding a wig for Cosplay...?	I'm currently planning a Cosplay (Costume Play) of Terra Branford as she appears in the PSP game Dissidia: Final Fantasy. As her normally Blonde hair would make me look too washed-out and pale, I am going to be making her alternate outfit, which involves a Dark Green, Curly Wig.       I have looked online for a while, and I have found several wigs that would work, but don't come in the right color. I know that certain wigs can be dyed, but I'm not sure I trust myself to be able to do that. If all else fails, I know my Mom could do that, she's dyed other Costumes for me, and they turned out wonderfully.       I don't want to spend more than around $70 for a wig. The website www.creativeuncut.com has a gallery of Dissidia artwork if you're unfamiliar with the Character, just click on "Video Game Art Galleries" at the top of the page, then scroll down until you can see "Dissidia: Final Fantasy" on the list.

20090304132243AAJnhho	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How do you get rid of lip hair other than shaving or waxing?	I'm a girl, and I'm having a problem with the hair on my upper lip. It never really bother me that much because I can't see it. But in the sun, it's extremely obvious, and today someone noticed and now he makes fun of me for it, so I was really self conscious all day. I've gotten it waxed twice before, but I am NOT doing that again, it stings like hell! I've also tried bleaching it, but that also stings like hell, and surprisingly for longer than waxing it does. Plus, when you bleach it it's still there, and still obvious in the sun. Is there anything that I can convince my mom to let me try? She's not gonna let me shave it (she claims it'll grow back darker...I think that's a total myth. I've never seen proof. Prove me wrong if you can!). I've thought about that Smooth Away thing they advertise on TV, but I've heard it doesn't work well, and of course my mom doesn't think it will work. Yesterday I saw a commercial for some kind of skin cream that's supposed to minimize facial hair growth, but I suggested we try that and my mom said she's not gonna get me some drug that has to come from a doctor when I can just get it waxed... ._.

20090304131554AAQMlRf	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How can I save my navel piercing?	Ok, so I got my belly button pierced 5 1/2 weeks ago and changed the barbell after a month like they said I could, it was red the WHOLE time, but not too bad. The holes looked fine and everything. It was healing pretty well, just was purplish/redish and crusty. I have cleaned it well and in the right way the whole time through. I cleaned it with dial when I showered (even used it as a body wash so no perfume body wash would get into it), did sea salt soaks at least twice a day...until I switched to the sea salt spray stuff, and I never put any perfumes down there, no boyfriend licking it, no touching it with dirty hands, nothing. I did everything right, than this last sunday which marked week five of having it, I noticed a bump on the side of it...not where the holes are...and it still was really reddish/purple so I went to the place I had it pierced. The lady took me to the back and examined it. She said it wasn't infected, but that it looked like there may have been sumn in there that was irritating it but it passed though I guess, and she also said she didn't think it was migrating. I asked her about an allergy to the metal and she said no symptoms of that either...so she said to use hydrogen peroxide for 2-3 days instead of the sea salt (in this case) even tho you DON'T USE IT IN NEW piercings......so my question is....HOW DO I SAVE IT...because I think the hydrogen peroxide was not effective at all....or very little....so please help me save my piercing. What should I do?? It looks like this currently.....I switchedback to the sea salt spray now....after using the hydrogen for two and a half days...          http://s21.photobucket.com/albums/b270/g...     http://s21.photobucket.com/albums/b270/g...        http://s21.photobucket.com/albums/b270/g...        http://s21.photobucket.com/albums/b270/g...

Sorry if its too long....Don't know from where to start actually as my case was a bit different than others. I'm a girl and always liked the way I looked and not only me but sooo many others also believed that I look cute. But again I was the one who liked my own looks most of all. I had confident, and I hated any kind of surgery. However in our country almost all the girls go for surgeries like 'nose job'. But my nose was really good and I liked it so much. to make the story short ...I dont have a nice and supportive family at all, my parents have always been terifying for me as a girl and then for my younger brother too. And I am 27 years old girl and and in our culture we have to live with parents as long as we are single. However I am planning to move abroad soon. But under a very hard situation after I feeled that I am ashamed to go out and to see the neighbours, as of the shouts of my father and his mad behaviour, with the pressure of my depressed mom (me who has always been the most happy and smiling girl) went under the surgery with having like 100% doubt. I know it has partly been my responsible to avoide making what I didnt like happen. But now I have lost my favorite looks and nobody notices the surgery but everybody just like me see the bad changes that I have gotten. Many doesnt notice my surgery but I have a very deep feeling of "missing my own looks, the nose I liked and though was not all perfect from others views but I liked it so much and changed it just for even unknowns. Feeling like having done something vain and having a deep feeling like have hurt myself and having lost a part of me :(. That said I am and have always been the one who didnt even like to put much make up and was beautiful and cute the way I was :(. Yeah this nose is somehow making me very sad each day. It has been 8 months (I know they say it takes 1 year for full recovery). But I cannot imagine much good changes in the rest 4 months actually either.   I know my own nose doesnt come back...But this has actually hurt me more than enough :( I'm somehow getting sick of this nose that I dont like even a bit of it....It just happened with me not liking to do so....I just sometimes think it has happened like a nightmare and I cannot get rid of it. How can I be happy again? any expereinces or nice and kind advices?      Looking forward for your replies....(trying to find remedies actually as it makes me so sad, for someone like me who liked everything only in their natural way :( )

Well im a tattoo artist, and i was just wondering if those artists who do the nipple tattoos(on breast cancer survivors), or possibly other medical-related tattoos work in a different type of shop than a regular artist.      are there tattoo shops made specifically for that kind of work?      i just want to know because i think it would be a very gratifying job to have if i were doing those kinds of tattoos on a daily basis.

20090304132222AA4HUAJ	Beauty & Style;Hair	HELP ME! I messed up my hair color!!?	Ok, so for the past couple months I've had my hair a dark auburn color (really red in the sunlight) and i got blonde peekaboo highlights put in. I decided to strip my haircolor with LOreal Haircolor Remover and then dyed it a Light Ash Brown with Revlon Colorsilk. Anyways, my hair looks horrible. It's like a poopy color light brown with LOTS of red in it still. There are also dark patches of reddish brown in some spots and the top my head (roots) are the lightest color, which is almost blonde.      I have light eyebrows which is why I wanted to try to go back to my natural color, but I'm thinking I should just go back to a Medium/Dark Brown but I don't know the best way to do it.       1) Do I wait a few days to dye my hair again?   2) Do I dye my roots first since they are the lightest?   3) What kind of hair dye would I use? a darker non-brassy brown?   4) How can I completely get rid of the red tint in my hair?         p.s. I know how to dye hair, and have dyed my own hair for the past 6 years. So don't tell me to "go to the salon" because I won't go there unless my hair is unfixable. Thanks!

You DO NOT have to use polyvore, but you can. You can just post the links to each item.   Guidelines:   Must be high-quality. NO American Eagle, Hollister, Aeropostale, or Abercrombie. Stores like Ralph Lauren, BCBG, Anthopologie, and Juicy Couture are fine, but others are okay too.      Try to keep the outfit $300 or under. If you don't, it's okay.   I don't care how many pieces are in the outfit. If it isn't a 1-piece, include a top and a bottom.      Not for any special occasion, so day clothes are okay.       Additional Information: I'm a 14 year old girl. This is me:  http://heathertaco.piczo.com/?cr=5    I KNOW I have a big forehead. You don't have to tell me.   Thank you!

Here's the color:  http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c76/ra...       Here's the important stuff:  http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c76/ra...        http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c76/ra...       I'm trying to find a necklace/earrings to match the bow/gems in the bow on this dress.      Any regular CZ's or Diamonds are too bright and white. The rhinestones in the bow are like..tinted yellow/pink. So i don't know what kind of jewelry to look for/search for online.      One last thing- I think SILVER metal would be the best to match this. It looks fresher and not too "gold-on-gold matchy". But silver with diamonds is too bright and white and doesn't look good with the yellow and yellow/pink tint of the gems in this. So thats my dilemma. I was also considering gold metal with diamonds?                and yes ik i posted this question already, but i took new pictures since the old one looked wayy tooo dark! =D      thank you all so so so soooo much! =) =) =)

The tattoo I want is Freddy Kreuger's claws slashing at my shoulder, blood seeping threw the wound, and his face in like the background and stuff.  I also want to know how long it would take to get the tattoo, I want it to look realistic. However like I said before I can't handle pain, I hate needles so the only way I will get a tattoo if they are able to numb it so I will not feel the pain. So, are you able to numb the area you want tattooed? For me it will be my shoulder and half way down my arm.

Ive already tried to change it, and i can get the hoop through my ear but im having a really tough time closing it. It hurts my ear like crazy and i totally cant close it when i try. To close it you seem to have to have to grab the hoop part AND the clasp part really firmly, and you cant when the whole clasp is through your ear -.- please help?? i will definately award best answer to the stratigy that works!

What is this thing you all have going on with jeans that are so many sizes too large for you that your a** is almost completely exposed?  Do we want to see your underpants - no.  Do you seriously check your rear view in the mirror and give yourself a thumbs up when you see that your bum cheeks are resting on top of your waistband?  Why do you do this?  As an advertisement of availability for the gay market?  Are you all rent boys?  Why do you do it?
