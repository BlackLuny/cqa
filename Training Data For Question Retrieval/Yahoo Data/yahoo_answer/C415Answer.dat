ZbP7vYAraa	Vc n?o especificou qual tipo de mancha quer tirar para te dar uma boa resposta.... <br>  <br>  Mas se forem manchas amarelas, devido ao tempo que ficaram guardadas podem ser retiradas fácilmente com uma boa lavagem, mas antes apenas ensaboe bastante e coloque de molho com sab?o em pó "bom" e um pouco de candida. <br>  No outro dia, após terem ficados de molho esfregue e retire todo o sab?o e a c?ndida dos tecidos. <br>  E coloque em uma bacia mais sab?o em pó e esfregue as pe?as. <br>  Depois é apenas enxaguar bem e por para secar na sombra, de preferência. Ficam como novas. <br>  <br>  Mas se for outro tipo de mancha, como de comidas, molhos, é preferível usar "Semorim" (que vc acha em qualquer supermercado) e passe sobre o local manchado e use uma pequena escova para esfregar. <br>  Repita a opera??o e deixe com o "Semorim" umas 8 horas, e depois proceda como disse acima colocando de molho, enxaguando, e colocando de molho novamente até o enxágue final. <br>  <br>  Espero que possa te-la ajudado, mas seria muito mais preciso se dissesse o tipo de mancha. <br>  <br>  Fonte: Morei sózinho e solteiro por muitos anos, e sempre tirava as manchas assim.<br>  Um abra?o afetuoso.|`|AA12005596	Deixar durante várias horas dentro de leite, depois esfregar a mancha com vinagre ou lim?o ou ainda água sanitária diluída.|`|951dbb6f10aa046dca4c86813c1e4419aa	Roupa branca?

KjQaxGX0aa	Hi Your picture shows a girl so I will work with that.  The answers so far are good.  You could walk the dog, mow the lawn, wash cars, babysit(although I think 13 is too young) not sure about paper route and we don't have trash cans in Australia anymore.  All these things are fine if you live in a good neighbourhood  where the neighbours get along.  What about asking your parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles if they have friends who need odd jobs doing.  Also if you happen to live in a small town you could contact local businessess to ask if they have any odd jobs.  This doesn't really work in the city too much competition for work.  How about delivering catalogues after school/weekends.  One your parents would have to get the job but you do the leg work and pocket the money.  Trolley collecting at supermarkets is another one but you need to be strong and that's why boys normally do it.  Have you thought about a stall at a local market, with a parent or friends?  Are you any good at making things, like greeting cards, jewellery, etc.  You can sell things you no longer want or need.  I have done quite a few markets and made some serious money. There is always volunteer work but that would be mostly school holidays. Hope it helped|`|3QtO3SpFaa	I don't know where you live, but a paper route would be a good job for a kid. Also, just doing little odd jobs for people around your neighborhood. Like mow the yard, pick up leaves, take the trash cans to the curb for elderly people. Those kind of things. You can advertise to the neighbors by word of mouth. Let your work habits shine and people will take notice.|`|AA10750524	I was babysitting on weekends at 13 years old.

e3d6184a3ea55a02fdece0e08105ed3aaa	Don't worry about it.  It's just some seeds or plant pieces that are sprouting, just turn the pile over and they'll become part of the compost.<br>  <br>  Compost is truly wonderful stuff. It adds nutrients and organic material to your garden while keeping lots of stuff out of the landfill.<br>  <br>  Making compost isn't rocket science. Some folks like to just pile things up and let nature take it's course, while others like to do everything they can to speed thing along, It's all about what fits into your lifestyle. A properly constructed pile can reach temperatures of 150 degrees internally which will kill any weed seeds.<br>  <br>  To properly construct a pile you should alternate layers of high nitrogen materials (fresh green plant material, animal manures, kitchen wastes) with materials containing carbon (dead leaves, straw, newspapers). Items you should never use are meats, bones, fats and dog or cat manure. The dog and cat manures can contain pathogens that are harmful to humans.<br>  <br>  Using a containment system depends on how much room you have and how organized you want to be. I use recycled sections of fencing for my bins, but you can also use pallets, garbage cans with drainage holes in the bottom or anything else that will contain the compost and provide drainage. The only thing I advise against are the "compost tumblers." They are very expensive, and while the theory behind them sound appealing, they do not have tha capacity to have a large enough mass to heat up properly, in my humble opinion.<br>  <br>  Check out our website for more composting ideas at-<br>  <a href="http://www.gardening-at-the-crossroads.com/compost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardening-at-the-crossroads.c...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck and Happy Gardening from Cathy and Neal!|`|wdAhcZTxaa	Actually, the inside of the pile needs to be "hot".  Are you watering your compost pile?  It needs to remain consistently moist.  Make sure that you are turning the compost pipe with a pitch fork regularly.  The composting process requires plenty of oxygen.|`|BUMcntqDaa	Seeds and things that you threw out have started to grow.  Check out this website.  You need to mix the compost with dirt.

3ddf005595c8b453708d608592924293aa	Put on some peppy music and wear comfortable old clothes.  Set a goal or a time limit - for instance, pick up all the clothes off the floor and put them away, or work for one hour without stopping. Reward yourself with a coke or lemonade while taking a ten minute break.  Then set another goal or pick an area to work on. Keep at it until it's done, or give yourself a time limit, like before, then take a short break before finishing up. <br>  <br>  Oh - make sure you have a big trash bag with you to fill as you go.<br>  <br>  If you have a "kitchen" collection in your room, such as snacks or dishes, have a tray so you can corral all that stuff in one place.<br>  <br>  Have a hamper, box, or bag nearby to collect dirty clothes. <br>  <br>  Put "like" things together.<br>  <br>  Once you get all the surfaces cleared, dust first, then vacuum, or sweep and mop, depending on your floor surface.  If there's an inch or more of dust and fuzz and dust bunnies around, knock everything off with a feather duster, next, tackle with a rag sprayed with dust solution.  Don't forget to clean mirrors and glass surfaces.  If you have book shelves, take all the stuff off  and dust the shelves.  Use a feather duster or microfiber mop on the books and knick-knacks. <br>  <br>  Then, organize. Throw away a bunch of stuff, and I mean, be ruthless. Throw it away!  <br>  <br>  Sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it?  Well, it is!  Hey, you asked, didn't you?  I have a feeling you are a teen, and I know how teens' rooms look.

YMwUpBIAaa	they are really easy to find even north in the summer. most mursuries will have them in the summer, also home depots or lowes will have them. if you still cannot find them their their are some nice ones off ebay. search date palm and you will see some 3 gallon palms for only 8 dollars and they are a nice size.    nice indoor palms are    bottle palms  date palms  lady palms (expensive, but worth it)  sago palms (actually a cycad, stays nice and small)  spindle palm (same family as a bottle palm, but shinier and rarer)  parlor palm (expensive sometimes, but fast growing and stays small)          also if you live in an area that has winters that are cold, but temperatures on the coldest night of the year dont go below 0-5 degrees fahrenheit you can still grow palm trees outdoors. windmill palms can tolerate 10 degrees and if you wrap christmas lights followed by burlap on the trunk, or put a garbage can over small plants on cold nights it can survive. needle palms can survive down to -15 Fahrenheit once old, and can take dips to 0F for short durations with only a little damage. young trees will not survive these extremes, but can survive down to 5 F and 0 with protection.        good luck|`|YOt6uTSzaa	There is so much to learn about taking  care of houseplants.

grKtTRYtaa	All these ideas are good.  There is a product called Dryell that you can get in most major stores.  It is for dry cleaning in the dryer.

lwMmZY4Xaa	Are you sure they are cement and not fiberglass? Are they solid or hollow? You should maybe run the fourth floor joist out to the columns and put down some subfloor or decking material before adding the new columns. What are the diamiter of the 3rd floor columns? You need to determan the load bearing max on them. If they are fiberglass and 10" they should have a max load of around 10 thousand pounds per column. This should be ok. How far apart are the columns? This will also play into the wieght and how evenly it is distributed. Also check the load max on the new wood columns they will hold much less than the fiberglass.|`|W8HsTKs0aa	If the wooden columns are square and a standard size, use a bracket designed for deck construction. They are made of galvanized sheet steel and are bolted down to the concrete in the center. Look into an epoxy product (maybe 3M) that will allow you to use a stud to hold the steel bracket in the concrete. Often, cracks occur in a narrow column if an old fashioned lag anchor or lag type stud is used.

Your heating element is most likely out and needs to be replaced.  It's not something you can do in the next half hour.  But just in case go to your breaker box, find the correct breaker and turn it off.  Then turn it back on and try your dryer again.  It's a long shot that will probably not cure your problem.  If you have a gas dryer you might have a clogged line or your gas might be out of service due to a repair on the main line.  If you have other gas appliances you can check them.  If they aren't working at least you'll know why your dryer isn't heating.  Last resort is to pull out your iron.  Start with low heat and work your way up to where you need it.|`|428cefd98c948f9b77b3cd98f614844faa	Clean the lint trap first.

Heat makes them spread the scent more. Continue to clean the spot but use a stronger All purpose cleaner. Even go to the extreme and use pet anti-oder sprays.

x86mC8yyaa	Yes, you can, but be sure to get a nice fat growbag with plenty of compost in it to hold enough water to keep them going. Plant the seeds in late spring (in May in the UK) in pots of compost in the greenhouse or indoors on a sunny windowsill, or preferably in a propagator to get them to germinate. Put one seed in each pot.about 1/2 down in the compost, and use quite big pots as they grow big very fast. When danger of frost is past, and it's reliably warm, harden them off by putting them outdoors on sunny days and then gradually get them used to outdoor conditions. Plant them out in a sunny spot in your growbag, 2 or 3 per bag, and if possible give them a bit of shelter (horticultural fleece) if you get a cool spell, as they do sometimes take a while to get going when transplanted and left out at night. Keep well watered, use liquid fertilizer. The first flowers to appear may not result in courgettes as they may be males, but as the plant grows it will produce female flowers as well and these will have a tiny courgette visible behind the base of the flower.

You can buy a small bar in Depot that will help you unsnap a middle section---if  the nails seem tight--you need to back off them a bit and hopefully the vinyl will work itself out.. if you don't have extra its going to be difficult to match it perfectly if you need to replace panels.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Curtain wall is a term used to describe a building facade which does not carry any dead load from the building other than its own dead load, and one which transfers the horizontal loads (wind loads) that are incident upon it. These loads are transferred to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, wind forces acting on the building, seismic forces (usually only those imposed by the inertia of the curtain wall), and its own dead load forces.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	The term originally meant the long lengths of wall between towers surrounding a castle. It has since been adopted to mean the 'skin' which covers modern buildings, which is carried off the structure of the building, and has no structural capability. Virtually any high rise office building that you care to think of will have a curtain walling system of some kind - the cladding material may be more or less anything: stone, glass or stainless steel for example. <br>  <br>  The term is more specifically applied to glazed or partially glazed systems - otherwise it is simply described as cladding such as might be found on a factory building. Beloved of architects when it was first introduced in the early twentieth century as you could have immense areas of glass - which turned out to be a disaster - freezing cold in winter, boiling hot in summer.  Modern systems are rather more sophisticated. <br>  <br>  Rain screen cladding is another form - distinguished by the fact that it is really a cosmetic covering to (usually) blockwork or some such and so does not perform the same weatherproof function of true curtain walling.|`|bxlYleZkaa	A curtain wall is a wall which does not carry any weight from any other part of the structure. Its purpose it to fill in a space between, for instance, two turrets of a castle, to complete a defensive circle.|`|kvjp8GPnaa	A curtain wall can have two meanings:<br>  <br>  1. It is a non-load bearing facade on a building, usually glazed such as on an office block or similar. Here is a link to a wikipedia definition <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtain_wall" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtain_wal...</a><br>  <br>  2. Also called a diaphragm wall this is a method of building basement walls in poor ground conditions. The 'wall' is dug as a trench using a grab bucket and as the trench is dug it is filled with a liquid slurry made with a clay product called bentonite. This supports the sides of the excavation and is constantly topped up from a bentonite mixing plant. When the trench is complete reinforcing steel cages are lowered into place and then the concrete is poured through a pipe called a tremie from the bottom of the trench. This displaces the bentonite as it is heavier and the bentonite is recovered to a holding lagoon. Once all walls are sunk and the concrete cured the middle of the basement is dug out. This is a simplified description and there are many variations but it is an expensive, complicated and messy job. This is a reasonable description from wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_wall" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragm_w...</a>

5d9pCmjyaa	A queen ant has probably set up her colony somewhere within your house.  I've had that happen to me once. I used diazanon to rid myself of the colony and it worked great.  The ants would carry diazanon to their colony where it would kill the queen.  But the U.S. govt. banned residential use of  diazanon in 2004.  I'm not sure why.  I guess it was too easy to poison yourself or your pets with it.  It's still available on the internet, but if you live in the U.S. it's still illegal for residential use.<br>  <br>  You should go to your local tractor supply store and tell them the type of ant you infestation you have.
