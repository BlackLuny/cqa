I'm 24 and enjoy all of those games a lot.|`|BTczpeUQaa	I was asking the same type of questions a few weeks ago, but if you are still looking to invest into a Nintendo DS game, then you should consider purchasing a Nintendo DS storage unit instead. With this unit, you can download ALL and EVERY SINGLE Nintendo DS games on the internet (for free), and run it on your Nintendo DS. This accessory even cost less than the price of single game. Its call the R4DS card. I have over 2000+ Nintendo DS games on my computer now and I have trouble playing them all indeed. Definitely worth the money.<br>  <br>  Check out the following for further details about it. To be frank, its just so legit!<br>  <a href="http://www.NDSstoragecards.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.NDSstoragecards.com</a>|`|PGAKu4Mzaa	depends on what you like. i know a few people in their 20s that play pokemon diamond/pearl because of the changes they can do to pokemon stats and they can battle eachother/ cook/ w/e together. other games would be lunar, chrono cross tho those are rpg like.|`|hecLfcedaa	Try Mario games. They are so fun. Especially Mario Bros.|`|E0WMJwTMaa	Hi hockeysticks, Nintendo games are rip off to be frank. I used to invest on games for my children every so and then. I just couldnt bare with it any longer, as each game cost is so much. My kids usually got bored with the games within a short period of time or so. <br>  <br>  Good thing, I become aware of and bought a storage unit for the Nintendo DS, call the R4 DS card. Now I can download Nintendo DS games from the internet (FREE), install it onto this storage device and use it on my Nintendo DS. Its absoulately no difference between the download game and the ones yuo obtained from major retail shop such as GameStop or BestBuy etc. Saved me a lot of $$$ and my children are extremely satisfied. They now download new games almost daily now. <br>  <br>  Oh! You can also play movies and music on your Nintendo DS too, just by using this storage device.<br>  <br>  Here is what I am talking about, you will be amazed;<br>  <a href="http://www.systemgears.com/info" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemgears.com/info</a>|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	I love MarioKart!

AA11850311	which specific graphics card do you have?  Sims 2 Double Deluxe has MUCH higher system requirements than the Stories games.

7Ca2ns47aa	All of those expansions are my favorite... but I'd have to recommend Open For Business over Seasons... but you should still get seasons eventually :P|`|mesqZ1mUaa	I would recommend Free Time first - lots of new careers and hobbies for your sims to do.<br>  <br>  Seasons would be my second choice - with one caveat. Make sure you have a good computer. If the came is at all slow with what you have now, I would not get Seasons. The weather calculations are extremely taxing on computers.|`|hecLfcedaa	Okay. I would'nt get open for business. It's really hard to understand how to own the business and the sims need bar drops too fast when they're running it. I don't know what seasons is like.Sims Freetime is a really fun one. You get a second aspiration and it downloads awesome new activities to do.|`|j2NfHzjPaa	I should recomend the sims 2 Seasons. The weather changes! It is so awesome!!! I have it!!! It's so cool!!! you gotta get it! Oh my!!! It's so cool. It snows and a lot of sun and in fall and spring!!! It is so cool, promise yah ;)!

CMNZikAnaa	sadly i don't think there will be a psp saints row, but i feel your pain|`|lhuJ5K5caa	i'm sorry but the PSP cannot handle the graphics of Saints Row 2. But you never know maybe in the future...|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	There will never be a Saints Row 2 for Playstation Portable. Saints Row 2 is too high-tech for it. The reason why Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories is because they are PSP-material as in, not sold for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.  Another reason is because PSP does not have the buttons you need in order to play Saints Row 2.

2a9b73f7bf7e0cd4e948b84be973ed30aa	This is the only way that you can transfer your songs. You have to own both games.<br>  <br>  You can export your Rock Band 1 songs to the hard drive and use within Rock Band 2. It costs 400 MS Points ($4.99) to purchase a transfer license. Four songs from Rock Band are not transferable: "Enter Sandman" by Metallica, "Run to the Hills" as made famous by Iron Maiden, and "Paranoid" as made famous by Black Sabbath are unavailable for transfer in all versions of Rock Band.<br>  <br>  To do this, you have insert your RB1 disc and unless you've played it since RB2 came out, you'll have to update it. Once that is done, they'll be an "Export" command on the RB1 menu. After that, you will be prompted to pay the 400 Microsoft Points for the transfer. Select a storage drive for the songs to be downloaded onto (most likely, your hard drive) and once completed, you'll be able to play your RB1 songs on your RB2 game.|`|PQy6if0Waa	Gotta have RB1 and RB2 games, obviously. Go to RB1's main menu, go to Options, then to 'Export Songs to RB2', which will cost 400 Microsoft points. There you go.
O5YIKaVfaa	lol your stuck with this as the best answer...
xDubataIaa	I am going to go ahead and say get the ocarina lol. <br>  <br>  The PS3 is overpriced, and has a relatively small library of must-play games. If anything, I would recommend a 360 over that. <br>  <br>  The DS is awesome, has a large library of fun games. However, the DSi is coming out soon so now may not be the best time to get one. Personally, I don't care for the DSi but the added features may matter enough for you to wait and get one of those instead. <br>  <br>  Now an ocarina on the other hand would be great! Never played one myself (or even held one lol) but I would never recommend a game system over learning an instrument. I am huge gamer but learning an instrument, even one a uncommon as an ocarina can be greatly rewarding and fun.|`|NkyPZMynaa	ocarina first because you don't have to spend extra money on it for games like the other 2<br>  <br>  Ps3 because it is newer than DS and you can get internet on it and order games and movies or whatever you want. When you get this make sure to get fallout 3 it is in my opinion the best game.<br>  <br>   DS last because it is kinda outdated and like you say yours might turn up and that is a lot of money wasted|`|jwoVlmV5aa	DS. It's amazing. Games I recommend:<br>  <br>  Nintendogs<br>  Mario Kart DS<br>  <br>  For I've never heard of an ocarina, so I don't know anything about it. Please, go for DS. It's a WHOLE LOT CHEAPER THAN PS3! Besides, with the DS, you can take it anywhere! :P<br>  <br>  So, what's it going to be? A stationary thing or a hand-held thing that you can take anywhere?|`|BDbRVrhXaa	I'd wait until April 5th and buy a dsi.|`|Cr1DoHuqaa	i have an ocarina and a ds lite both a big let down so i would say xbox 360 but if u prefer the ps3 then its the better choice|`|jxpV13rTaa	ps3 easily. trust me.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	PS3 all the way. Top of the list...<br>  <br>  But um... why are you going to buy an ocarina? lol...
7Lmdrxicaa	I don't think so, beacuse they probably need a blu ray disc to get the new HD quality to work. Isn? AC complete the same as AC, but with HD quality?:P<br>  <br>  Just buy an PS3, then you get a blu ray player ;)
kthrNyAdaa	man good question.  im a big fan of both characters.<br>  <br>  in the end im going to have to go with Snake.<br>  <br>  i know that both have to survive using a good amount of stealth.  i know that both are good with weapons.  Snake doesnt have to worry about getting bitten/infected.  Leon has always had to avoid that.  therefore Snake usually able to get up close and personal with his enemies and lets not forget CQC.  i think snake has that advantage over Leon.<br>  <br>  again in the end i will go with Snake.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Leon, considering he has the same weapons as snake. If snake has the launcher then....well|`|UoxracOPaa	Leon is a badass and I like him better, but without a doubt Snake would easily win, Snake is a highly trained agent who has had experience fighting giant Metal Gears, terrorists, and army guys. The only things Leon fought were some parasite infected zombies, and a couple of bosses (no where near as powerful as the bosses in Metal Gear)|`|i84D9j5Paa	Snake because his pants are too tight so they cut off circulation to his butt, so then when Leon kicks it he wouldn't feel any pain and have the upper hand.<br>  <br>  Unless Ashley was with Leon, then she could just annoy Snake to death.|`|dwEJ94yEaa	snake definately bcuz he is more stealthy and has better weapons. in my opinion leon just llkes to charge into places.|`|hgamJ1JBaa	Snake no doubt<br>  <br>  I think he is cooler<br>  bolder<br>  smart<br>  has cool story lined game series<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL

jLb4PAreaa	The easiest way is to have the modem connected to a computer, and then share the internet connection to the ps3.<br>  <br>  If you are to do that, there is various aspects you need to consider depending on your operating system and if you have a router.<br>  <br>  In short, you should have an ad-hoc (wireless direct connection) OR wired, if available, network between your computer and the ps3, and then just activate sharing in windows.<br>  <br>  Windows XP: and assuming you have a working direct connection between the ps3 and the computer -means NO router-:<br>  <br>  1. First make the computer share the internet connection by: Right clicking the internet connection and choosing "Properties" in the "Network Connections" section in the control panel<br>  <br>  2. When you have the properties in front of you, Click advanced tab and choose activate sharing for other computers.<br>  <br>  (<br>  Also you could check the second box too, about automatically dial up when someone on the network wants to use the internet.<br>  <br>  If you have multiple network cards (NIC's) choose the NIC that is connected to the PS3 as the "connection to the local network"<br>  )<br>  <br>  Done! <br>  That activates a DHCP server in XP that gives out an ip-adress, and all information needed for the console to use the 3G connection, and its basically the same in vista, just that network control panel is located elsewhere.<br>  <br>  You need to tell more about your setup for me to guide you.<br>  Do you have a computer, router wireless network access in either of them?<br>  <br>  Feel free to mail me for more and better help.

Hiasgb75aa	Only have Gyarados keep Surf.<br>  <br>  It looks like your team is based around water so I could get my Sceptile and Weavile to own your whole team.<br>  <br>  You either need a psychic type like Alakazam or a ghost type like Gengar.<br>  <br>  Instead of Surf, teach Tyranitar Fire Fang or Flamethrower, your team needs at least two powerful fire type moves.<br>  <br>  Instead of Surf, teach Nidoking Rest or Ice Beam. Rest is important, but if you can't get it, Ice Beam would be useful<br>  <br>  For Dragonite, swap Surf with Outrage the power of Outrage combined with its attack bonus is important|`|qbmkMWqeaa	You have Surf, on all your pokemon, why? Leave it on Blastoise and get other powers for for the rest. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, Gyarados can learn Dragon, Electric and Fire powers by TM. I'd go with Thunder, Flamethrower, Bite, and Hyper Beam.  For Dragonite, I'd go with Twister, Wing Attack, Dragon Claw, and Outrage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you could add a Dark or Psychic type.|`|JDuakHYRaa	Change one of the surfs to an electric move maybe Thunder (dragonite) and maybe another surf to psychic (nidoking)
uE70jPiEaa	Ah ok. Well, since I have both headsets I can help you out a little bit here. The original wired one costs less, and is about as durable as the wireless one. I really do not see a difference there. With the wireless one it is way more expensive. Also the wireless one is farther away from your mouth, which makes it more sensitive to sound. So you probably won't have to talk as loud as you usually would with the wired one. Really, in the long run I think they both last about the same, with the wireless one being a little more convenient as it does not tangle or get knots. Hope this helped you out at least a little! Happy gaming!|`|FBGvUOVPaa	I prefers wireless so when I have friends over we can pass around the mike without having to deal with a short wire.
kVBDpAMTaa	You have to buy world of warcraft game and then the burning crusade and then wrath of the lich king, you can't just choose. You will need all of them.|`|uE70jPiEaa	Well it sounds like you are a bit confused here. There is only one version of World of Warcraft. The Burning Crusade is only an expansion full of bonus content and additional things. Same with the new addition of The Wrath of the Lich King if you have heard of that. Both are only ADDITIONS to World of Warcraft itself, each containing their own bonus content. I believe the Burning Crusade has been out for atleast a year and a half now, it gives you two new races to use in World of Warcraft, along with new areas and what not. I'm not to sure what the Wrath of the Lich King contains, as I have stopped playing World of Warcraft myself. I hope this answer has clerified your outlook. <br>  <br>  P.S. <br>  There are ways to use a sort of trial for the expansions.<br>  -Go to www.worldofwarcraft.com <br>  -Click Burning Crusade trial<br>  I believe that is an additional 10 days to try that out also.<br>  Goodluck and happy gaming!|`|xQByM54saa	Thats not how it works mate.<br>  <br>  You buy original WoW first, otherwise you cannot play, the other games are expansions, with extra areas and levels to add onto the original game for example<br>  <br>  World of Warcraft: Level 1-60 Azeroth<br>  <br>  World of Warcraft; The Burning Crusade: Level 60-70 Outlands Draenai/Blood Elves<br>  <br>  World of Warcraft; Wrath of the Lich King: Level 70-80 Northrend<br>  <br>  You HAVE to buy original wow then if you want to level above 60 you HAVE to buy burning crusade, if you want to level above 70 you HAVE to buy wrath, in that order.

bU9Iy8Gvaa	I think it would've attracted a greater following and interest if it'd come out a year or more ago. Dead Rising has been relegated to a classic that fewer people play.<br>  <br>  That said, I still think that for those that love zombie survival games that are more than simple first person shooters, this will be a popular game, especially if there's co-op as that's the big thing that was missing last time.<br>  <br>  I'm definitely looking forward to it.

JwGwUcCsaa	PS3!<br>  You already have enough money, what would be the point of getting a 360.  Most people who have a 360 complain about the price of a ps3 yet PAY for live?!?  Get the PS3, you get a blu-ray, a great gaming system, and free internet.  The PS3 has Metal Gear 4 and God of War 3 coming out soon.  Not to mention Warhawk, Bad Company, GTA 4, and the best graphics for the best games.<br>  If you get a 360, you might have to worry about the red-rings, and if it doesn't stand right, it eats your game disks!<br>  <br>  Ps, the online DOESN'T SUCK!!!  people who say it does are just fricking jealous they have to pay and PS3 owners dont.  In fact, for most games that are avaible for both systems, gaming grading company prefer the PS3 online play because it doesn't lag as much.  Plus, the PS3 online doesn't have as many 8 year olds who swear everytime you kill them.  Don't even listen to people who don't have a PS3.|`|r60WMB6paa	360|`|3eQhA8nraa	the new 360's are supposed to be "red ring" free. if you go with a 360, make sure that on the side of the box the pro is listed as having a 60 gig hard drive. i find that the 360 currently has better exclusive games, halo 3 (GRIFBALL!!!!!!!) and that all my friends have one. the ps3 has some major potential, and online play is free. that and it has a bluray dvd player built in. i believe the newer models are not backwards compatible. if you don't have a bluray player and have a high def tv, id get a ps3. if you don't have a high def tv, get a xbox 360 pro, and provided you have highspeed internet and a way to connect to you router, a year card of xbox live gold.|`|UzV0jc2haa	I have both and seriously the ps3.   The graphics are better and everyone says the online is worse but there isn't really anything different online besides you gotta pay on the 360 and you don't have to pay on the ps3.  PS3 also is coming out with an awesome game(god of war rated M and killzone 2 rated M)  which will be awesome.  I would take the ps3 over the 360 anyday.  Oh and lets not forget blu-ray player|`|PKULDaC7aa	Get a 360. It has more games of similar quality and you can buy many more cheap games than you can for the PS3, especially if you buy used. Plus the 360 has better online if you're interested in that. As far as the system crapping out on you, both the 360 and PS3 have equal chances of failing. I've had my 360 since it came out and its still going strong.|`|DY8YYluqaa	you can still get red ring on xbox 360 but they fix it for free if it happens within 3 years.<br>  Xbox 360 is cheaper, better online too, so you will have some money left for some games and stuff.<br>  <br>  playstation 3 costs a lot more and the games arent as good...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but your going to get people saying GET XBOX GET PS3.... but they are both as good as each other.... personally i would get the xbox|`|BLNiwHUDaa	the xbox 360 it is great and no red ring|`|OPHnir3Raa	You should by all means get a ps3. the price may be a bit high but taking into consideration all you get when you buy a ps3 its more than worth it. i personally have a ps3 and i can't put it down. there are tons of excellent games already on and are coming out for ps3. the ps3's blu ray player also looks excellent if you're into watching excellent quality movies. ps3 trumps xbox any day anytime. Has anyone complained about ps3 software or hardware malfunctions? NO. PS3 is the ultimate gaming machine.|`|FPsMtmThaa	RROD will always be in the minds of Xbox owners but the new "Jasper" models are supposed to be RROD proof.  SO find those ones and you should be fine.  It's really not that big of a deal. If you do get RROD, it will be under a 3 year warranty so just send it in, and its fixed. No cost to you.|`|VyzDoETuaa	Dude get the 360. The online is only like 6.00. Ps3 is free because their online sucks. The only thing good about the ps3 is the graphics. Xbox 360 has better games. I've had my xbox 360 for 3 years. It's never had rrod. I wouldn't worry about it. The new 360 is RROD proof. Don't get a Ps3, its a waste of money.|`|qhLcOyTlaa	i would get a xbox but ps3 are faster and they got some good games<br>  they are better but i like my 360 i mean you cant compete with halo3<br>  but you cant compete with call of duty world at war|`|mQM9UZpUaa	I would get whatever more of your friends have so you can play together. I don't own a PS3 but I can tell you that XBOX LIVE is great!|`|7Ca2ns47aa	You'll definitely have to worry about the red rings of death... along with everything else with the xbox.<br>  <br>  PS3!!!|`|cUDUrGyBaa	**** id keep the wii but its all on you. id say the ps3 cos that also plays blue ray discs|`|saGJIp5laa	I would get the PS3
uGL6L1dtaa	Once you break up, she will leave and go to the family bin i think. In response to your additional question, it costs no money to merge families. She can move back in for free if someone lives there. If no one does, she will start with the 20,000 simoleans for a new house.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	lol well since you'll have control of her once she moves in you can move her out back and go to the neighborhood and move her back into the Goth residence. however, i like one of the previous answers: just kill her.  it's kinda fun sometimes. if an appliance breaks and her mechanical skill is low, have her fix it. she'll electrocute herself. :D|`|LQ2Bxt8Qaa	she won't go home. she'll never go home. JUST KILL HER.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	depression|`|AA12094990	I'm not sure what happens after the break-up, but you could just move her to the family bin and then move her back into the goth house. That should work.
QriWp4fzaa	u can add me bloodhawk. ill join
QriWp4fzaa	none give trophies. but cod4 better online. mgs4 better story mode. cod4 czy and mgs4 tactical..|`|JwGwUcCsaa	MG4 is better because its single player and story is better.  You should play MG4 first so you can fully appreciate your PS3 purchase.|`|raEUval8aa	If you've played the other Metal Gear Solid games, MGS4 will be better to you. MGS4's online component is very team based and methodical. It's also very good. <br>  <br>  COD4's online play is frantic, twitch shooter that you can pick up and play easily. The single player is good, though short.<br>  <br>  Neither have trophies.|`|UzV0jc2haa	NO!  Metal gear solid 4 and call of duty 4 don't give trophies MGS4 probably has a better story if you played the first 3 otherwise call of duty 4 does.  Obviously online is better with call of duty  4 and wep call of duty 4.  So yea try cod4 first and then MGS4
QriWp4fzaa	add bloodhawk ill join u...|`|jdklZ1rJaa	hey HOLY is my hubbys clan name!
MnEHO9u9aa	could be possible. the other games were 3 years apart|`|62mt0VKJaa	I sure hope not, unless they change it up.|`|saGJIp5laa	The AC games were left about three years apart, so yeah, but that also depends on if nintendo plans to make another one. and also there is another pattern to the releases, they were released on different consoles every time, so if nintendo makes another console sooner, then it would be sooner.<br>  If this confused you, i am sorry. But i hope i helped you.|`|vE0ECnV0aa	Most likely yes but if they are thay should make it so you are able to do more things and a diffrent area besides city,wild world, and the one for game cube
AA11089669	I've beaten all the CoD games and here's what I can tell you. For the campaign missions, whereever you are, make sure there is somewhere concealed near you where you can hide out and wait to heal if you are injured. Also, in this game enemies respawn until you advance, so the best thing I have found is to clear out an area of enemies, and then move forward quickly and find new cover to stop them from respawning in that spot. Finally, make good use of your grenades, they can be really effective if used at the right times. If there is a big group of people together, try to burn a grenade and land it right in the middle of them and take out a large group at once.<br>  <br>  As for the Zombies, please PLEASE do not uses the glitches people are telling you about. For one, what is the point of playing the game if you can't die? Any monkey with a controller can stand in a corner and shoot people if there isn't a chance of him dying. Also, if you are glitching, it will make the game freeze for the people who are not glitching and can potentially ruin their disc.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	try try and try again|`|XO5TY6tPaa	Try Doing Glitches Type 'Glitches' In Any Search Engine and it will come up with cod 5 glitches|`|GMzjnG2Oaa	well if you have live then go onto live and play team deathmatch or any other game type for that fact and just play, play, play. you'll get better the more you play but some tips i can give you are.<br>  1. don't run around too much, if you do then you cant stop fast enough  to get your gun up to shoot at people.<br>  2.place any bouncing bettys or any other mines in random spots around corners so people cant see them.<br>  3. keep your sensitivity at medium or so because you don't want to be trying to shoot somebody and your too slow or too fast.<br>  4. another good talent is a fast trigger finger so if you run out of a clip you can switch to your pistol quickly and kill them that way. <br>  5. watch Your back a lot because yuor teammates wont.<br>  <br>  all in all it just depends on what perks you have and also what gun you have. me and my friends were the best at CoD 4 and CoD WaW, on a regular game we would get about 20 kills each and then if you put us together we were unstoppable because we also know how to work well together as a team. but you neeworryt wory about that now. just try to get better.|`|PrRNMDXRaa	dont listen this idiot above about glitches... If you have to cheat to win you might as well not even play at all.<br>  <br>  Just try different methods and tactics. it takes time to become great|`|qhLcOyTlaa	youtube will tell you some glitches for nazi zombie and campain
8x0oe23aaa	forget them don't even touch them and when healers come move them away from them.
LKiVXEcCaa	Yeah gamestop has refurbished 360's, and they very in price to what you want. for example the refurbished with the wired controller costs less than the refurbished one with the wireless controller. The refurby I got from gamestop didn't come with the hd, but all together with the hd came out to about $200. AND no point dont work for cash sorry man. O BUT what you wanna do is buy theyre 1 year rrod warranty just incase, cuz I'm on my second one now
uctxzjIIaa	In the dead-end section of town, opposite the center of Rabanastre from all the other shops. Unless you have joined Clan Centurio, there's really nothing in Murthu Bazaar at all. However, once you are, a Bangaa there under an awning will sell you stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also buy Teleport Stones in the shops on the Leisure Airship trips.
AKWsmH6naa	so far, there r only four:<br>  David, ALTNOY, Digital, Rain|`|lTLkv2Bkaa	you have to read the clues and then enter to the websites ... its SIMPLE!!<br>  <br>  but ill help you with the first code so you can get the wallpaper<br>  its DAVID
7uwAI1y3aa	I am not 100% sure this is what you are thinking of but it sounds very familiar.<br>  Temple of Elemental Evil, released by Atari in 2003.<br>  The graphics are trimmed down a bit to cram more content into the game so I can see why you would consider it an earlier example. Early in the game you explore the moat house which is prison-like in many respects. The main evil in the game is Zuggtmoy, Demon Queen of Fungi. Turn based role playing games with parties do have a feel similar to a strategy game with the same camera angle you describe.<br>  <br>  If you aren't in to playing old-style Dungeons & Dragons computer games you might not enjoy ToEE very much.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
245e6145aa5f4cd6c9aae8a4f627ef1baa	if you dont have the disc, you wont be able to install it AT ALL !<br>  <br>  unless you download it<br>  <br>  Or re buy it|`|DBIeKv49aa	I recommend emailing or contacting EA in some way, because if they see you have a valid code, they will probably send you a disk or link to download it. The original sims is very cheap now, with the Sims 3 coming out in June, so you may just have to buy another copy. Unfortunately, there is no way to borrow a disk as your data is saved to the disk... I think:)|`|iXpQdp45aa	you need 2 put the cd into your computer <br>  so you wil have to buy it again <br>  <br>  go on a online website like<br>  www.amazon.co.uk<br>  www.ebay.co.uk<br>  <br>  you should b able 2 get them cheap enough from there :)|`|jU7ASbDdaa	Well if you lost your cd case then you're out of luck, but i think the code is included in the cd case.
fpGroPpzaa	They won't send you a confirmation unless your drawing is picked to appear in an issue. That could take as long as a year because they keep artwork that is good and save it for upcoming issues, so even if yours is picked there is a long waiting list.
3d131bca01d0625796c23ebc8a924047aa	If you are wondering how not to get the RROD then just take regular breaks and do not leave it on overnight or anything make sure you have the setting that makes it auto turn off after a certain time to like 3 hours of inactivity.|`|62mt0VKJaa	Don't buy an inter cooler -.- There have been so many people who have bought them and its shorted out their xbox or the inter cooler malfunctioned and ended up melting to the back of the xbox. We had one and we went through 3 xboxs before we figured out it was the inter cooler and chucked it. And we haven't had any problems since.|`|D7iYNq2Maa	Lay ur xbox 360 down, dont put it on the carpet, dont put the power brick near xbox 360, clean dust off the system, dont play too long like 3 hours or more, and don't buy a intercooler, because it absord the energy from the xbox 360. Hope i help.|`|eCrLwRTZaa	dont stand it up.<br>  lay it down.<br>  and get an external fan.|`|aSq7YLzEaa	make sure the back of the xbox is not against the wall, you want it to have about 5-7 inches at least of space so it can exhaust all the hot air out, keep the room cool in summers avoid playing long hours lol you notice cause when you play during the summer you room can turn up 15 degrees than the outside :D, Do not leave your xbox on for long hours if your not using it turn it off. Oh and DO NOT MOVE YOUR XBOX WHILE A DISK IS INSIDE OF IT! IT WILL SCRATCH THE DISK major! AND POSSIBLY DAMAGE THE READER!|`|DQGutEkjaa	Buy the Inter-cooler for it. Keep it off carpet and away from animals to prevent dust and hair from getting inside the console. And lay it flat on a surface, not vertical. This should help from you causing any problems to it, but always remember that you have a Warranty from Microsoft with it.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Keep your xbox 360 on a flat surface. Clean the dust from it every couple of days with a clean cloth. I recommend buying the inter-cooler for it. The inter-cooler will keep your xbox cool and prevent any overheating/red rings of death.|`|8i76USBBaa	DO NOT TOUCH IT.<br>  <br>  DO NOT TURN IT ON.<br>  <br>  lol all i did was move it from tv to tv in my house (always very careful, i never even dropped it) and is has slowly developed tons of little problems, bordering on big-enough-to-anoy-me-but-not-anoying-en...|`|tpPO7qehaa	DON'T **** IT UP.|`|DY8YYluqaa	What do you mean good shape?<br>  Because whatever you do it will break anyway...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I played 2 of mine every day... after 5 months.... each broke...<br>  My friend played it for no more than an hour because he was paranoid... and made sure he took the disc's out etc before shutting off... and it still broke....<br>  <br>  <br>  So ....

DBIeKv49aa	Hah! I just answered a question on this. Yes, the instruments should work for the other games as long as they are the same console.
gDF7tTZAaa	To the bone heads who hate on the game:<br>  <br>  If you hate a certain game and brag about it on the internet you are the reason playing games is very shitty... Runescape doesn't have a meaning it is said on the website... The point of the game is to let us create a story.  So the guy who said it was meaningless you are correct. :]<br>  <br>  <br>  When i played i trained in the Stronghold of Security, for you level you should train on guards and when you get to level 40 go to the Stronghold of Security, go down two levels and train on flesh crawlers, they have massive fire rune drops and the are easy to kill. They also re spawn rather quickly but there is usually a high amount of people killing them.|`|ojavmDcgaa	Ignore the ******** that answered before.<br>  <br>  Answer: If you are just starting, most people just kill goblins until they are a decent level (10 in atk def range and str). With the new addition of the security stronghold (i haven't played in a long time but I was good) you can earn some easy money. Just Google a map and get a path and you can run straight through!

5EJ3rLbvaa	I want a 360 also, and I've been having the same concerns.  I don't want to buy a $200 arcade or more just to have a new one come out and they stop making games for the 360.  I don't think that any new ones will come out in the very near future, among the factors one being the economy.  A new console wouldn't sell well if people can't afford it.  I get a subscription to EGM and haven't seen anything about a new console, so hopefully not anytime soon.|`|vzVSYzWLaa	I really don't think Microsoft,Sony and Nintendo would have designed new models of their consoles in just 3 yrs.   I would think the next consoles would be out in 2010-2013ish. I dont think that they would be anywhere near complete by next year.   Because you know, the companies want to suck every dollar out of their products.|`|MHo2SGPRaa	I think you will be safe for at least 18 months(more realistically probably 24 months). I have not heard of any (home) new console coming out. I haven't even heard any rumors about a new console possibly coming out. The technology has really been pushed for the price point at this time. Their is a small rumor or Apple and Sega possibly making a joint venture...but even that is possibly just a small rumor started by a Sega Fan Boy...    PS...

FH0oIzjwaa	Definatly 2.  Megaman 3 had the best music though.  2 Just had the best storyline in my opinion and the best ending.

Dso7k3sjaa	I answered your other question, last night.  The one that was similar to this one.    The message you are getting is a message caused by Securom.  It is a copy protection that EA puts on to all of their computer games now.  Many, many people can play the games without ever seeing this message, but there are many others who, like you, went out and bought their games legally, from a legitimate store, and are still getting this message.    It does NOT actually mean that the game you bought is a "copy" at all.  It is a MISTAKE that is being made by the Securom on the disk.  Why does it happen to some people and not all?  No one is really sure.  It is thought that maybe it depends on the other software you have on your computer.    You need to do some reading to learn about Securom.  Last night I gave you a link so you could simply put a no-cd crack in and play it that way.  Apparently you are not comfortable doing that.  So, today I am going to give you a link to another website which will talk about Securom.  On that website, you can read what has happened to other people because of the securom.  You can read about things they did to try to fix the problems they were having.    But one thing you need to know is that even though you legally bought this game, from a reputable store and it's NOT an "illegal" copy, Securom is seeing it that way anyway.  EA is being sued in court by 5 different groups of people right now over this Securom mess.  You are NOT the only person this has happened to.  As far as how to fix it, the answer I gave you last night is really the only way you can fix it.  If you try to get EA to help you, they will simply give you things to try that do not really work.    Here's the link for the site where you can learn more about Securom:    http://reclaimyourgame.com/|`|NXznTrbQaa	I'm assuming you talking about another question that you posted earlier. edit your answer with more details or link the url of the last question so we can help you.

y02PZj22aa	For knitting a hat with the "usual" circular method, 24" is just a bit too long.  It is also quite a bit too short to use what is often called the Magic Loop method (when I discovered it by accident, I just called it "Hey, I can knit small circumference things by pulling all the cable I don't need out of the way and artificially creating a 'front' and a 'back'").  <br>  <br>  Right now, I am knitting a pair of baby socks on 60" circular needles (both socks at once).  Clearly, there is a lot of needle cable left over;  it's just pulled out of the way.  To see what it looks like, take a look at the video on Magic Loop at KnittingHelp.com (<a href="http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/advanced-techniques" rel="nofollow">http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/advan...</a> ).   This technique works best on long circs with *flexible* cables.  One of the women in the knitting group at church permanently kinked a circular needle that was of less flexible plastic and too short for Magic Loop for the sweater sleeves she was knitting but too long for traditional circular knitting.<br>  <br>  If using a long circular needle and storing your knitting on just portions of it doesn't ring your chimes, using two circular needles would be my second-best recommendation.  There's a demo video at the KnittingHelp.com link for knitting small diameter projects on two circular needles.  I have also knit multiple pairs of socks and mittens at the same time using two circular needles.  My warning to you if you decide to use this method is, *make sure the needles are different colors*.  When you knit with this method, the stitches that are cast on to one circ *stay* on that circ--so when you work, both needle tips you're working with should be the same color (which I found out the hard way).|`|WbJPQM1naa	Knitting a hat in the round, you would really need 16" circulars AND Double pointed needles for managing your decreases for the crown.   You can use two longer circular needles and you put have the stitches on each and knit in the same fashion as you would use double pointed needles.  You can also just use four or five dpns.  <br>  <br>  If you go to youtube and search "cat bordhi" you will find her video demonstrating using two circular needles for knitting. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your hat and feel free to message me if you have any more questions.<br>  <br>  R|`|q0EwnYroaa	you need circular needle with circumference less then the item you are knitting. if your hat will be 18" in  round when  finished (measure circumference around your head) you will use 16" long circular needle because the stitches need to fit comfortably around the needle and meet at the tips without stretching. Using a needle that is too long can result in miss shaping fabric. <br>  <br>  p.s. you can always order your material online.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	yeah 60 cm equals 24 inches, so no those circular needles are too long to work in the round when it comes to knitting hats. you should have circular needles that are shorter then your head is round.<br>  <br>  you can still use those circulars and simply knit the hat flat and seam it up in the end.|`|P0kmmwtCaa	24" may be a little too long for a hat.  If you can't find 16" needles, you could try using double pointed needles instead - they're usually easy to find.|`|154dzJ1Faa	No, I feel that 16" is too short. My larger hands just can't handle such short needles. I prefer something much longer, perhaps 36" or 40".  I like to use the Magic Loop method.  You can use any length of circular, even very long ones, to knit fingers of a glove!<br>  <br>  I feel that you should have only one length (a long one) in every size of needle and you can do anything with those.  So there really is no need to have every size in every length!  Too costly, and too much to try and keep in order.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can always knit any circumference using two circular needles -- the front and the back.  That means I can now use all those short needles.  I've used this on socks and hats and mittens... anything in the round.<br>  <br>  Or you may find that knitting a hat with double pointed needles easier for you, and you have a lot more flexibility with them as well. You will still need them when you decrease for the crown, or you may have to learn the Magic Loop for that anyway.  It's not the length of needle that is important, but how you use them.  They all work, and you can only work one stitch at a time with two pointed stitcks anyway.

Edit: Andrew, he didn't specify, so you can't assume.

HzGNm97Maa	that is such a silly question. The answer is obvious. Xbox 360. Reason is because Xbox is more social. People who play Xbox live talk to you, you will have such a blas communicationg with other people if you ever do decide to hook up to Live. Its wort it and besides Xbox carries the most amazing games scuh as Halo 3 and the Gears of War series and even Fable 2. Im not sure what your game style is but Gears of War is a third person shooter that involves an epic battle between good and evil packed with all the blood and gore and game lvoer could ever want. Bottom line is, xbox is better. It have external memory which is usually your best bet because with internal memory what hapens when you out of room? You need an alternative. My reccomendation is Xbox all the way.|`|cumhOqjXaa	Well if you want awesome hardcore in your face games then get the 360.  It has really good games for you and every1.    Sure Online is not free but its the best.  360 i recoomend.    I might buy it this Saturday as well.   =]|`|pl2SocVKaa	playstation 3|`|pFzkC9y5aa	If price isn't an issue then PS3 by far the best option.     - Blu-Ray,   - Huge memeory space,   - Ace games (Little Big Planet , Metal Gear Solid 4, Resistance, Motorstorm etc)   - Best upcoming games (Killzone 2, Heavy Rain, MAG, God of War3 etc)  - And the best thing, no red lights :)|`|AA10911217	same amount? that's a hella cheap PS3!!!    seriously tho, if your friends with PS3s are fine lending you games you may do better with that, having said that as xbox is so cheap at the moment and quite a few games like gears of war are very cheap it's a prtety impressive prospect    best thing to do is go to gamespot.com and look at reviews/video reviews of the top games than decide which games you want to play and whether more of them are on one console, easy, don't forget ps3 also has blu-ray so if you want to buy or borrow these movies and have a decent tv, you get that funcionality too|`|5KdPRKIVaa	Honestly, I have both and there are more games, better online components, and better looking graphics (mostly) on the 360. But the 360 tends to break all the time while the ps3 is more reliable and can play blu-ray movies. I say, if you are interested in gaming mainly, get a 360 but if you are interested in some gaming and watching movies in hd then get a ps3.|`|X9iZA9svaa	ps3 is a lot better because    better graphics  better gameplay  better games  can play dvd and blu-ray  costs more (which means its better)   wireless controllers  can play ps1 and ps2 games on it  more gig  online game play is free    out of those 2 consoles i suggest you buy a ps3 its brilliant|`|YvdFoGQ2aa	Xbox 360    Many more "ace" titles than the ones listed below for the ps3 and "ace" titles coming out than the ones listed below.    Xbox live is a great service and with the way it works you can make friends easily.    Even though it doesnt have blu ray...why would you buy a system to watch movies anyway? Oh and thanks to a new deal between microsoft and netflix if you have a net flix account you can just stream movies form your xbox.     The equipment is durable except for the system itself which even if it does break and red ring microsoft will fix it for free. as a side note it sounds as if your not a very serious gamer so even if it does break and has to be sent out for a month you should still be in good shape.    Huge arcade selection including some games from the genesis and super nintendo era.    xbox has more competitions and give aways and things like that.    more in game downloadable content is made and released for the xbox compared to the ps3 which only gets not even a third of that.    No installation process which throws the ps3's "HUGE" storage space thing out the window    and thats all that can really be said about the xbox|`|m7fgw4BSaa	I got xbox 360,  gears of war 2. halo 3. need i say more, yes, save music on xbox n every game lets u listen 2 music if u like, 360 have acheivment points, u get msn on xbox live.  i hear ps3 has free online gaming. but if u compared the looks of the games quality, its like when sega genisis vs super nintendo. i was all nintendo. n in this case xbox is my clear winner.|`|pp0kcm4uaa	out of all the times i have seen this question ps3 won about 17 of them and xbox 360 won  about twenty two i guess its just what type of games you like or do what i did buy both
5KdPRKIVaa	It hasn't been announced as coming out and since it was made by Naughty Dog who makes games exclusively for Sony, I doubt it ever will.|`|pFzkC9y5aa	Yes, like the above user said Naughty Dog work almost exclusive for Sony so its very very very unlikely it will appear on PC.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No.  It's for the PS3 only.

ZfIj286kaa	1) California Adventure has more thrill rides so probablly better for teens<br>  2) You're going to see this more at Disney land<br>  3) The best for that would be Disney land not sure what shows they have going on now they change.<br>  4) Very worth it and not hard to do you're not going to get every single ride in at both parks asnd there's not as many in California adventure but they're both amazing parks.|`|VwZvy5H7aa	well DCA has more thrill rides for teens and not so long lines, they both have the mickey mouse they also have good show but DCA is kind of better in those 2 things when it comes to fireworks Disneyland is better, YOu can do DCA in less than 5 hours if you use the fast pases and walk back and forth so you can get on the ride faster while doing something else but you will get tired in one day. its better if you do both parks but if you are going with a lot of people you should chose disneyland especialy if there are more lil kids|`|2URc5Safaa	i love both dca and disneyland. but its better to go to disneyland than try to do both. dca is more for maybe grown ups. there are more stores and resturaunts and shows there , and for kids too. disneyland is better for a teenager diffinately more thrill rides, good shows good food its more like lively too cobblestones and all. disneyland is more fun. california adventure is more for like a casual hang out day like a carnival disneyland is like a natural high.|`|H6LKMffraa	dca has more thrill rides.
zkscW8seaa	There have been several changes to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, and because of these changes, even the game itself has been renamed as the Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Trading Card Game to cope with itself.<br>  <br>  Here are the most major term changes to game:<br>  1. Tribute Summoning is now called Advanced Summoning.*<br>  2. When you Tribute a Monster in general, it is referred to as being Released.*<br>  3. Your Main Deck MUST have at least 40 cards but no more than 60 cards.<br>  4. The Fusion Deck is now called the Extra Deck to support Synchro Monsters.<br>  5. Synchro Monsters are a brand-new card, where you combine the Levels of Tuner and non-Tuner Monsters to Synchro Summon.<br>  6. The Extra Deck MUST not exceed 15 cards.<br>  7. A new main type of card, Psychic, has been added. This is an actual Type, NOT a Sub-Type like Union or Spirit.<br>  <br>  *These terms are interchangeable in the game, only Japan has made it official to call out Advance Summon and Release. Otherwise, say Tribute Summon or Tribute whenever you like, they are the same as Advance Summon and Release respectively.<br>  <br>  Of course, the biggest change is the new white-border Synchro Monsters, coming off from the 3rd Anime series of Yu-Gi-Oh!, that being Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's. These Monsters are put in the Extra Deck with the Fusion Monsters and can be Synchro Summoned by Tuning a Tuner Monster with a non-Tuner Monster.<br>  <br>  Tuner Monsters are a new Sub-Type card, much like a Union or Spirit or Gemini Monster, Tuner Monsters are indicated by saying the word Tuner next to the Monsters Type. So far, only Effect Monsters and a select few Normal Monsters are also Tuners. As for non-Tuners, these are cards that simply do not say Tuner on them in their Type.<br>  <br>  To Synchro Summon, you simply add the Level of the Monsters you want to Tune together, and bam. Synchro Monsters MUST have ONLY one Tuner Monster, and any other number of non-Tuner Monsters so that Level of those combined Monsters equals the EXACT Level on the Synchro Monster. This is basically the same rule that Ritual Monsters use in terms of adding Levels together.<br>  <br>  For example, to Synchro Summon Stardust Dragon [LV8], you could Tune the [LV2] Krebons with the [LV6] Destiny Hero - Malicious. You could also Tune the [LV4] Rose, Warrior of Revenge with a [LV2] Morphing Jar and a [LV2] Mystic Swordsman LV2. Note that to Synchro Summon, all Monsters being used must be face-up and on the field.<br>  <br>  Other than those rules, terms, and card changes, the game is just as it was, but better. Also, if you happen to catch the new series Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, they have introduced a new way to duel, called Turbo Dueling or called a Riding Duel. Of course, this type of duel is Anime exclusive for now, where duelists ride D-Wheels [or Duel Runners] and duel using the power of speed.<br>  <br>  Basically, the entire duel is played using the Field Spell, Speed World. This is where players can only use Speed Spells based on the number of Speed Counters they have. Any other Monsters and Trap Cards are also used, only Spell Cards are changed. Again, this is Anime exclusive so don't get confused.<br>  <br>  Disclaimer: Please, do not take your Mattel Duel Disk, attach it to your bicycle, and duel on it while riding at high speeds. You may get hurt, and will probably look downright silly doing it. LOL<br>  <br>  Anyway, did you get all that?|`|mHWsuqjZaa	Well Synchro cards are monsters that go in your extra deck (formally know as fusion deck). You get these cards on the feild by haveing the EXACT amount of stars on you tuner (explain what they are in a bit) and your non-tuner monsters. say you have colossal fighter, an 8 star synchro, and you have a 6 star monster and a 2 star tuner. Then you can summon colossal fighter. Now say that 2 star was a 3 star, then you could not synchro summon colossal fighter because 6+3=9. to many stars. Synchro monsters usually have amazing effects, take Black rose dragon for example. It can clear the feild when it is summoned and give 2400 direct attack! Tuners are special monsters you must have to bring out your synchro monsters. You combine these with normal mosters to bring out your synchros.<br>  <br>  Also there are a lot of changes to the yugioh card game. It is much faster paced now than it used to be, and tributing is a thing of the past. sure you will see the occasional blue-eyes deck but normally they are running a set of anceint rules (allows you to freely sp. summon a lv. 5 or higher monster). Well i hope i have helped you out and gave you a lot more knowledge on the yugioh TCG.

y02PZj22aa	How do you usually learn best?  That method is what will work best for you.  If you have learned other skills from books, then a good book with good diagrams may be the best way for you.  If you prefer seeing a demonstration, YouTube videos or an instructional DVD may be best.  If you need to try it for yourself and have an expert on hand to correct your errors and walk you through the basics--and give advice--perhaps a class is in your crocheting future.  Or you might enjoy a combination of multiple methods.<br>  <br>  I agree that $25 per class is a high price for crochet classes.  Does that include a "beginner kit" to make a project on which the entire class will learn together?  A book and/or video?  Lunch?  The kit of pattern, hook, yarn, and other materials would lower the per-hour charge a bit; otherwise, consider the per-hour charge.  In many places you would be able to find less expensive (but adequate) classes through the Continuing Education division of your local community college or through Adult Education classes through your public school system.  <br>  <br>  If you decide on a book or similar instruction, I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting is available at most craft stores for under $10 and rudimentary instructions are available at the Crochet Guild of America web site for free (<a href="http://www.crochet.org/lessons/lessonr/lessonr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crochet.org/lessons/lessonr/l...</a> --for right-handed crocheters; left-handed crochet instructions are also available.)<br>  <br>  You're on your own for finding a YouTube video that works for you; there are many available (some cause me to grind my teeth; others are excellent).  I *can* recommend the DVD of I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting! which is available from Amazon.com at this link:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Cant-Believe-Im-Crocheting/dp/B000GD85IU" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/I-Cant-Believe-Im-...</a>  (and from other sources as well; however, you might want to read the user reviews at the bottom of the Amazon.com page).<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, a book or video may or may not have anticipated the question that becomes critical to you ("OMG! This yarn has a big knot in it that will show in my project. What should I do?").  You can always ask an instructor (well, usually--we've all known the weirdo who comes in, demonstrates, and leaves and refuses to take questions).  Or you can come back to Yahoo! Answers and ask it here.|`|154dzJ1Faa	It depends on what kind of learner you are.  Some need to actually see it, some can study books.  I do like the idea of an actual class, where all the basics are covered, and you get a good start.  Most of the work will come from you with lots of pratice, practice, practice!<br>  <br>  I do agree that $150 seems a little high for only 6 classes.  However, if there is nothing else, you will have to accept it or not.  I would let the coordinator of the class know that the price is too high.<br>  <br>  Sometimes only one class is all you need, just to get the basics of how to hold the hook and yarns, of what all those short abbreviations mean, and where to get more information.  After that, some on-line videos may help (careful about YouTube -- not all of them are done very well, or even show you the correct way to do things).<br>  <br>  How do you learn the best?|`|jjDZJmfpaa	Taking classes opens up to a lot of things one doesn't really suspect. One that you will gain friendships that you would not have had before. You will also see the mistakes of others in the class and get first notice on what not to do. Taking on new hobbies can be frustrating and hearing others tell of their same frustrations gives you an awareness that you are not alone.<br>  <br>  Having said that, reading a book will allow you to go over something you have missed without any hissing and sighing from other people who caught on faster than you. Looking at free videos online will save you money and you can see them over and over again. For the most part when the instructor is finished with the class it will be up to you to learn all of those abbreviations and in order to do that, you will have to read. You know where I am going with this? You will have to read anyway!<br>  <br>  Go and take a look at the tutorials on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a> and make your decision after seeing all of what there is to offer for free.|`|rYNM67oyaa	$150 seems like an awfully high price for classes.<br>  <br>  Try following the directions in the following web sites.

l9jtfrU4aa	Well if you’re looking for a good class for team fighting, then you will want a tank class like a paladin or a warrior.  I say this because your friend is a class that’s used to draw the enemy out, and do damage from far away so to be a good team you would need to be the player that gets up close and personal with the enemy.<br>  <br>  But if you’re looking for just a fun class to play I would recommend a warlock. They can do a lot of fun things and once you get their level up they can be very useful when playing in groups or by yourself.  A rouge is also fun to play simply because you will become an assassin, and lets face it…assassins are awesome!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  -Pandora-<br>  <br>  Oh, and you don’t have to get all your gear from the Auction House. Some of the best gear can be found while looting dead bodies or won after completing quests. Also, why wont you have a lot of money, you know that you can find it on almost all humanoid bad guys, and that most quests award you with some after you complete the quest.|`|f3f3bVRcaa	It depends heavily on what you enjoy more! Healing, tanking, damage dealing are the main class roles you want to consider. Paladins are a good choice owing to the fact that they are effective doing any of these roles.<br>  <br>  It also depends weither, at maximum level, you prefer PvE (raiding with many other players) or PvP (playing against others). For PvE, consider the roles above. For PvP, there are some classes more effective that others. Rogues for instance are very powerful in PvP.|`|S8rldtsgaa	you could be a warrior or a priest.<br>  warrior is a good start,but thats gear dependent.Priest is a little harder,but if u get a feel of it then it rulez ;).and if u do instances,u wont be needin' money for auctions ;)<br>  +rogues are plain fun....but if you stick with night elf,then u cant play paladin,warlock,shaman (i played shaman to 70 so i now a lot 'bout it,and its trong too),etc.

It should then begin a connection test, and if it's succesful, you'll connect. <br>  <br>  I just did that off of memory, so sorry if something's wrong.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The game can be played in multiplayer just like if it was a local game.

y02PZj22aa	You didn't mention whether it's one of the red satin hearts or one of the clear plastic hearts.  However, here are ideas for both:<br>  <br>  Clear plastic: <br>  <br>  1.  Use at your vanity to store cotton balls, makeup, your retainer, lenses, or other stuff you keep at the sink.<br>  2.  Put your cell phone in it while it's recharging.  <br>  3.  Use it on your dresser to hold keys, cash, credit/debit card and "stuff" from your pockets.<br>  4.  Use it in your desk to hold paper clips, push pins, and so on.<br>  5.  Use it as a spoon holder while cooking.  The top and bottom can be used separately.<br>  <br>  Red satin:<br>  <br>  1.  Use it to hold memorabilia (that's probably what most of them do in Red Satin Heart Heaven).<br>  2.  Use it to hold a cross-stitch project.<br>  3.  Pry the heart off the lid and glue it on the cover of a scrapbook.<br>  4.  Pry the heart off the lid and glue it on the cover of a storage box.  You could make a nifty unique storage box with a boot box covered with appropriate wallpaper or gift wrap (the lid and bottom covered separately, of course) with the heart glued on the top.<br>  5.  Use it to store the CDs that came with your computer--the operating system and so on--that you hope you never need, but when you need them you need them.  If they're in a Valentine box, they should be easier to find than tossed into the stack with alll your other CDs.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	You can keep some of your dead animals in there.

MsqINb58aa	I think Horde is better than Alliance.<br>  <br>  If you want a faster and easier way to get level 80 or need better PvP gear, I recommend getting in touch with the U.S. company Yeh! for Games, Inc., you can give them a call at 702-425-8654 or just google yeh for games to get their website.  They are based in Nevada State so it is very safe and reliable, unlike all the other unsafe websites that are from foreign countries.  My friend got them to level his death knight to level 80 and was one of the first 80s on his server.  I am planning to get the new PvP arena gear and have them run Naxx for my Tier 8 gear.|`|jv9kTxtYaa	Generally, I would say blood elves, as they are the most attractive horde race. and face it, if you're going to be staring at a character for a LONG time, you might as well look at something aesthetically pleasing. If you want alliance however, it purely depends on which racial you want. Either a pvp trinket for humans, or that good dranei HoT, or the Night Elves shadowmeld and faster death running speed. Personally, i play Belf, as i prefer the horde side of the game and ADORE arcane torrent, but my alt is a night elf. Also, you need to take into consideration which classes there are, Such as if you want to be a horde paladin you need to be a belf, and for an ally shammy you need to be a dranei. Night elves and Taurens are the only ones who can be Druids, So if you want to play that class you need to be them.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	It depends on what class you're playing. But Horde is better because Alliance is for simple-minded children who don't realize that Thrall is the main character and hero.|`|YdQOpsHCaa	It doesn't matter whats the best race, that doesnt even exist.

dcOClaUAaa	You need to find torrents that people are seeding.  With torrents, it downloads the file from other people who have the file, but those people have to be seeding.  If no people are seeding, it will never download.<br>  <br>  Also, if there's more peers than seeders, it'll take longer since more people will be going off the seeders.<br>  <br>  So yeah, try to find ones that have more seeders than peers.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Torrents aren't illegal.  Downloading things that have copyrights are illegal, but if you use torrents to download things that aren't copyrighted, it's not illegal.  Of course, I doubt anybody's going to be doing that.<br>  <br>  Also, I use uTorrent, and it works pretty well.  You don't need to set a maximum download rate with it and it will still work fine.|`|WZQ6fRDtaa	Torrents are screwy.  They are also illegal. Most of them dont work, and they are extremely slow.

They are the best, I don't know what I would do without them. <br>  <br>  They are illegal btw. Because we are downloading something that has not been paid for, or the manufacturer itself is not earning any money out of it, therefore it's illegal.|`|eESLJZ4jaa	Maybe you can try using Ares at <a href="http://www.toggle.com/lv/group/view/kl22461/Ares.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.toggle.com/lv/group/view/kl22...</a><br>  <br>  I use it by selecting torrent file, right click it then select open with > ares.

6xf5il22aa	First off make sure you have DSL or higher. You'll need to have wireless internet, you would know if you have wireless internet if you have a router. Once you have that set up, you go to your psp's internet browser, there it will ask you if you would like to use the psp's wifi to scan for a network connection. Scroll down the list of available networks and choose yours. Sometimes if you're lucky, your neighbors might have wireless internet that is not protected, meaning that there is no password to access their internet. One thing I almost forgot to mention was that if you look under the column "Security" after you complete the wifi scan, there it should tell you if there internet is protected or not, if it says "None" you're good to go.|`|WZQ6fRDtaa	wi fi with no security is easy. you just run a scan|`|fwcuyh37aa	wireless internet is the only thing that works , you need to grt the acces code off your wieless router unless your in a hotspot (hotel cafe etc) go into new connection turn on the wifi switch thingy|`|mgQuRnaJaa	Get a wireless router and connect it.

dcOClaUAaa	This is a direct copy and paste from a FAQ on Gamefaqs, I take no credit for this.<br>  <br>  This battle is somewhat surprisingly easy from all the hard sub<br>  monsters out there in Halloween Town. Really, Oogie Boogie is easy.<br>  You'll notice you are in his torture room so to speak that looks like<br>  Vegas slots. You'll notice a huge roulette table and when the fight<br>  begins, Oogie will toss you guys onto it. Oogie will toss some dice and<br>  conjure some Heartless monsters as his attack. At this point you want<br>  to target Oogie and use your magic attacks on him. Fira and Thundera<br>  work really well on him, even Gravity. Also, the Summon of Genie and<br>  using his Showtime magic on Oogie works reeeally well for long range<br>  attacks. Also if you have the Strike Raid ability equipped, then I<br>  suggest you use it to your advantage on Oogie - just watch your MP<br>  gauge it you want to use any other magic/attacks that use MP, just<br>  replenish your gauge with ether or mega-ether. He'll soon seclude one<br>  part of the roulette table and it'll rise up, if you are lucky it'll<br>  rise up right in front of him and you can jump up and do your air<br>  attack combo on him. After you do that, do a standing attack combo.<br>  Keep doing that till he pushes you off onto the roulette table again<br>  and work your magic on him yet again. Remember there is other Heartless<br>  running around on the table too. Halfway through the fight Oogie will<br>  start using the other contraptions on the table like a saw, just get<br>  out of its way if it comes near and stay in the middle of the roulette<br>  table since the spinner can block it. Also another torture device has<br>  these 3 blades that come chopping down on the roulette table, just time<br>  it right and Dodge Roll under them. After those are out of the way,<br>  more magic until he traps you on part of the table again and it rises<br>  up, you can jump onto the platform and attack him once again, and surly<br>  you'll finish him off then.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  C.) Just when you though it was over that easily, it wasn't. Oogie will<br>  transform even bigger and actually be the house that use to be Boogie's<br>  Manor. You'll have to go back and fight yet one more time....<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  |---C.) Giant Oogie Boogie| Difficulty: Easy | HP: 40 (each orb)---|<br>  ======================================...<br>  To start the battle you'll need to jump a long way down onto the ground<br>  and find a place to run up onto part of Oogie or the house. Remember<br>  what Jack said, attack the dark purple orbs. There are about 6 orbs on<br>  him and they aren't too hard to find. When you find one hack away at it<br>  till it explodes, and just repeat that for every orb. Oogies only<br>  attacks are sending off sub Heartless creatures to fight you and the<br>  cage of fire he is holding, swaying it back and forth. So yeah you need<br>  to dodge the fireballs that come close and when you get close to the<br>  cage he is holding run like hell to the other side, cause you need to<br>  get to the other orbs by running past that cage, if you get hit with it<br>  - it does a lot of damage, so be sure to heal yourself if you get hit<br>  twice. Find all 6 orbs located on Oogie Boogie and destroy them. After<br>  that, sit back and relax a bit cause you beat him.<br>  --------------------------------------...|`|2g1LbQutaa	haha that was forever ago... lets see if i still remember... i think you have to like... mabe hit whatever he throws at you back? i forget... sorry lol. look up a walkthru online, search for kingdom hearts oggie boogie walkthrough|`|PTovC2Dqaa	The battle with Oogie Boogie in Halloween Town is a little tricky due to his game of roling dice Oogie tosses into the wheel. Sometimes the dice turn out to be bombs, while others determine what type of machine the wheel will use to attack you next. Both types will hurt you dramatically and lower your HP down alot (it is a good idea to summon Genie during this fight).<br>  <br>  One of the attcks that occur is a large, three-blade, spinning weapon that circles the wheel slowly or fast with a bounce. The slow circle is easy to avoid by standing in one spot and jumping over the blades as they spin around. The bouncy blade is a little difficult, since you can take damage whether you're standing still or jumping into the air. Some rolls of the dice can also trigger a buzz saw that slices through everyone.<br>  <br>  All of this madness will continue unless you figure out Oogie's pattern and use it to defeat him. Unless Heartless enemies are present, stay locked on to Oogie so you can keep an eye on him if he starts to move around. He will parade back and forth with joy, trying to trick you. If your in the same section as Oogie, touch the glowing gems on the wheel you're standing on. This will cause the section of the wheel that you're standing on to become gated off and rise to Oogie's level. Once there, jump off the wheel and attack him with several combos with this rare advantage.<br>  <br>  Physical attacks are the only way to hurt him, since magic won't do anything to help you defeat him. After a few attacks, he will create an explosion that knocks you back onto the wheel, which will start the whole cycle again. Continue to dodge all the contraptions and machines of the wheel he uses on you, and stay close to Oogie at all times. <br>  <br>  With the victory of defeating Oogie Boogie, you receive the HOLY CIRCLET and ANSEM'S REPORT 7. Also, you receive 2,500 EXP for winning this battle.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	As the battle starts, Oogie Boogie starts throwing explosive dice at you. Defeat the Gargoyles he sends your way before you do anything else. After you've done that, get a lock on Oogie as he runs around the perimeter. He'll start throwing regular dice to determine what type of attack his giant roulette wheel will use. Some of the attacks include spinning and dicing blades that you must jump or run from to avoid, toy soldiers shooting guns, which you also must jump to avoid, and buzz saws, which, you guessed it, you have to jump or run away from.<br>  <br>  When the little symbols near the inside of the circle light up, step on the one nearest Oogie. This creates a fenced in area in which the platform rises and you are carried to Oogie Boogie. From here, it's just a matter of hitting him with physical attacks. The battle will be over after a few rounds of this. Also, although magic doesn't hurt him, you can summon Genie to help anytime.

Doesn't your pattern specify?  Usually they do.  It's important not to pull too hard on your thread so that it covers evenly.

I have been working at home successfully for the past 2 years so I know what works.    There are many work-from-home programs on the Internet today that will promise you the world, however most of these programs don't deliver on their promises. If you aren't careful you will end up joining a work-from-home program that just takes your money and leaves you with an empty pocket.    I know from firsthand experience which programs actually work and which ones will just steal your money. See, two years ago when my company was having layoffs I was worried about losing my job, so I started searching the Internet for ways to create a part-time second income.    After investing 8 months of my time and over $5700 in bogus money making programs I finally found a few work from home programs that actually work. Of the 28 programs I signed up for only one of them made me money. I have provided a review of this powerful system which you can check out.    I am now happy to say I no longer have a job with my previous company. No, I wasn't laid off, I retired just 6 months after I started using this system. I have been consistently earning between $15,000 and $22,000 per month using this work from home system.    Check it out and I hope this is the answer you've been looking for.|`|GiOL1xLoaa	www.greatjoboptions.com watch step 1 and step 2 then call Asod or Tammi at 262-623-2628 for more information.|`|YZ4ozLyyaa	eat capsicum ;)|`|njW7N3OSaa	i just found out i have fibro and arth, so instead of seeking wah jobs, i went to caeercenter, local job service, asked bbb for list of real wah companies.  try there.
6N7eF9tBaa	no they will have play lists for Recon. and it's on these new maps that there will be new weapons and armour. You properly won't play as a spartan. it will work like The legendary maps atm.|`|aZ9CGbYoaa	i know there will be a silenced smg|`|e8dc63c6a93e534d95e66cc04a7c3dc6aa	highly doubt it...halo 3 ODST is actually a stand alone and not an expansion pack...its gonna be its own game with its own multiplayer aspect to it...as for halo 3 there is the mythic map pack coming out which will in turn carry the chance of getting recon armor...so in a sense i guess you can say it does but at the same time it doesnt
muTCr40eaa	its the only gem i have but i forgot where to get it........... ok that was problobly not helpful :(
WMrNa3Doaa	Yeah, the actual storyline is pretty weak. And short.  However, it's still pretty fun to play.  I thought the ending was kind of different, if a bit anti-climactic.  I'm not sure if the game is worth the $60 though. And the new DLC, $10 for about 45 minutes of gameplay? I thought it was kind of a rip-off. But I did enjoy playing the game, despite it's flaws.    If you still need to open the Bowerstone Graveyard Demon Door, you have to kick a chicken at it.|`|3BO2mFZ1aa	Sorry but i thought it was really good.  The voice acting and characters were fantastic compared to, say, the two dimensional puppetts that were inflicted on us in fallout 3 and oblivion.  I thought the ending was pretty good, I ended up hating that Theresa woman, my poor character had gone through all kinds of crap (scars, old age, loss of dog, loss of family) and for what?  It just seemed to make me think, is this whole hero thing worth it, might as well have been an evil baddie and kept the dog...
uctxzjIIaa	Well, it's not coming out in the US until some unspecified date in 2010, and normally, there's about a 6-month lag on FF games between the US and Europe releases.

AA11850311	first, get the patches for all your games<br>  <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/update/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/update/index.php</a><br>  If you got houses from the Sims2 site, you could easily have gotten a piece of bad or incompatible custom content, that you may not even know you have.

40ObXE0caa	Don't report it. They might think your trying to get a belt that you didn't get. I suggest you try to look through your inventory one last time. Hmm... You know what, try reporting it!

COFPXYvZaa	once the game starts, there'll probably be a "main menu", and you get to choose between the original storyline and L&D. the special areas (safehouses and interiors) exclusive in L&D cannot be explored in GTA4, and presumably vice versa. the multiplayer will still be the same across both games.|`|O2dwxAysaa	I'm probably not helping because i cant answer that for sure but i was thinking maybe u play as two seperate games and it just saves seperately on whatever console you have for instace xbox 360 maybe there will be two seperate acheivemants lists and on the memory and stuff, and that u need the original disc for things like the whole map    I rteally cant answer that i guess im just going to have to wait till it comes out|`|qUuafpuwaa	It'll probably be that you go to another city, or that it is simply an "arcade game" in the game. Like in Saints Row 2 where there are arcade games you participate in. But if you don't have a 360, you don't need to worry your pretty little head over this, its only coming out for 360.|`|B0ToljScaa	I think when you start up the game it will let you choose between Gta4 and L&D but if you choose gta 4 you will not to be able to use all of the features the DLC gives you for example you cant go into the special areas you can go in L&D.
AA12337159	i really liked it too, i'm a huge fan of ther series, i've playd all the RE games except for cronicles, at first i thought that th co-op factor would kill the intesnsity of the game, but if anything it makes it more intense, and i think this is going to be the best so far, i already have my collectors edition paid in full, cant wait!|`|EagkCeNHaa	It's out? I haven't tried it out yet, but the game looks really good. It caused a lot of drama on the internet too which makes it even better.|`|Mea7w1Gzaa	i have a 360 but its fuckin awesome but i wish you could walk and aim at the same time.|`|Xn9J7RTAaa	Crap i wish i had a xbox 360!|`|WH8o5Ntwaa	i downloaded the demo for 360 but im sure the demo isnt much different i found it entertaining and a litttle challenging but not very difficult personally i liked the demo mission with the infected chainsaw maniac i found the two characters were cool but it was a little annoying raceing shiva to certain items but helpful when ur getting attacked or need healing over all i thought it was pretty bad *** and i cant wait for the actual game|`|a5gAwH4Laa	not keen to be honest,graphics are fantastic but i hate the standing still when u shoot,and not much ammo about

DtkLsetkaa	Several places you can get codes, most common is from the trading card game.  Some cards have special codes for in game rewards.  Another way is to go to the Blizzcons, each one you get a code just for going which has a special in game prize.  You can buy the cards on ebay or win them in the card packs.|`|AehuhUYcaa	you buy the codes or win them and you enter them for things like a few 1000g or tier items.

You could pick a best answer (10 points) then give them a thumbs up (1 point). TOTAL 11 points|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I've been playing those games for YEARS using MAMEUI. I don't know if I can say it's the best version but I haven't had any complains so far.    http://mameui.classicgaming.gamespy.com/
sgxGglK4aa	The Brainwave deck or Invisible Deck could be used for this or maybe a marked deck may be the way to go.|`|8QGt44O3aa	Hmm, a lot...  But I kinda forgot :O|`|AA12347684	Yes.  I can do a version of that.|`|hTv9chZ6aa	yes im very familiar with that its called the invisible deck|`|mTwn8p79aa	There's a little more to it than that.  That's usually a "force."  You've actually told them what card to think of but they didn't realize it.  This trick would often use a trick deck with slightly different size cards or multiple identical cards or both, mine uses the four of clubs but it could be any card.    If you've seen a trick on TV, don't forget about TV magic.  David Blain is a great example of the magician that uses the "OK, now close your eyes while I go over there" style of magic.  Another common trick on TV is just to have the other person (or large group of people) in on it.

L8XP51rdaa	Skip out on the PS3 and get a 360. The online is fantastic on the 360. You get plenty out of things you pay for, PS3's internet is kinda mediocre, the majority of PS3 users complain about features that are missing, especially if the game is also available on 360 as well. A large amount of gaming companies favor the 360 because it's sooo much easier to code games into, unlike PS3's hardware. Also, the 360 is receiving exclusive downloads for GTA4, something that won't appear on PS3, sadly.
7OOokw3paa	nope|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Yeah, I can, actually.|`|AA11763950	Nope.
4nROh3yOaa	I believe that hardcore gamers, make accounts get to level 50 on halo 3 and then sell them on , however wen you are lvl 50 your level cannot decrease, but if you die you experience still goes down.    Possibly the people who buy these account are then new to the game so their experience goes down very quickly.

OF COURSE YOU SHOULD! :D<br>  <br>  Oh yes make sure it is in great condition and works :)|`|kbE7LbZUaa	erm.. yes !!!<br>  <br>  thats a really good deal <br>  <br>  and theyre really good :P|`|ou2vZnkqaa	cheap! but there's a DSi coming up!|`|0AOTN962aa	Theres this thing called an R4 revolution for the ds. Its reallly cheap for like 15$ and you can get it at Dealextreme.com. <br>  Its a game adapter that requires a micro sd card. It can hold games or (called roms)  You download the gameonline and you place them on the microsd then put it the r4. You can then play it. You can has many games as your microsd can hold. they only take up a like 100 mbs at the most usaly. I can fit like 70 on mine. You can also listen to music and videos on it. Any questios email me at jtramirez94@yahoo.com|`|Or6RoRWDaa	I would think it's used. Check the condition of the console itself. Turn it on, try it out, make sure the person that's selling it isn't screwing you over.|`|RxSe8Mtjaa	Yeah very fun. Get brain age. Great game and very good mental exercise.
jK7pklCKaa	You dont even need xbox live to do system link as it is basically local play using 2 xboxs.|`|BLNiwHUDaa	ya just no online play or special downloads but if you play system link i dont think you need live at all but really why would you need gold that would be dumb for that it really defeats the purpose of having system link doesnt it|`|Id9ce5kPaa	Make sure you research halo wars, it's not your normal halo, it's a rts game and it kinda looks like it's going to suck.  Rts games (in my opinion) are made for the computer, not a console with a controller.  Don't think halo wars is going to be anything like 1,2,3 because it's a complete different style of game.

AUCcZ8lQaa	I would say 2-300 bucks.  You have some good games there, so as long as the xbox is working you should be set.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Go on Ebay and where the Sell section is, there is actually a button to check corresponding things for sale-look it up.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	Nobody can answer that for sure. You'll only get what people are prepared to pay, and that varies per person obviously. Your best bet is to try ebay and see what prices they are selling for. Keep in mind that xbox's are fairly cheap in the shops now, and people may not be as likely to risk buying a used one unless it seems like a good deal.|`|NYNnJQC1aa	a few hundred bucks my range would be 1-4 hundred
bb8h33w8aa	Well you also have Malaria, which the game should be leading you to a place to get pills you have to take every so often if it hasnt already.

I would recommend something like:<br>  <br>  Any gun with RDS or ACOG scope, as a silencer is not really needed seeing as there is no radar unless an enemy gets a UAV.<br>  <br>  Perk 1: Bomb Squad so you don't get killed by claymores if your planning on sneaking up on a sniper<br>  <br>  Perk 2: UAV Jammer for obvious reason - Stopping power is not needed on hard core:<br>  <br>  Perk 3: The Last Stand, i've lost count on the amount of extra kills i've picked up on hardcore mode using the Last Stand. Also, you could try using Dead Silence if you don't like the Last Stand.|`|WleS3Bugaa	I use an MP5 with RDS.  I also use overkill and equip the G3, again with RDS, as it's great for long range shots when not using a sniper rifle.

SkpRC2Nmaa	Which game are you talking about
1T35X8dEaa	most of the time when that happens if you want to play a certain game and the version needs to be upgraded you will be given that option to upgrade it, takes about 10 mins. to fully upgrade.<br>  <br>  I had that happen when I tried to play Lego Batman, and it said that my version needed to be upgraded. I popped the game into my PSP, and upgraded the version on my PSP. <br>  <br>  If you want it to install put the game into the PSP and it should give you the option to upgrade|`|UZjtXdlqaa	You could get your PSP to a hotspot and update the firmware from the internet or you could pop a game in that has the update data on it already. If that fails, you can download the firmware off of the internet and transfer it to your PSP. You can easily find a tutorial on how to do that on google.
A9TbEueYaa	nope you cant sorry|`|qtlzdtMVaa	No can do. Unfortunately that's the disadvantage for the ps3 and an advantage for the so called "xbox". You can transfer music from your computer using a USB memory stick but you can't play it while you are on a game =( I hate that.

3tuwWidiaa	Of course you made it up.  What you describe cannot be safe.<br>  <br>  Unless there is some mechanism to keep you upright, no matter how much foam is at the bottom will prevent someone from having their neck snapped.<br>  <br>  With the way you've described this, I'd expect about 25% of the "riders" to die.  Another 50% to be severely hurt, most likely paralyzed.|`|LAhGRwU9aa	yeh|`|X55FV04Kaa	It doesn't sound realistic enough and there is no proof about the safety. It also isn't very original, sounds too familiar to Tower of Terror and to me it doesn't sound like a ride i would go nuts for. <br>  <br>  The Name is also veeeeeeery un original|`|qS17gUVraa	ive always wondered what it would be like to totally freefall, but skydivings not really my thing, too high, and id be worried about the parachute jamming or something. sounds fun, but totally unsafe.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	No I dont like the sound of it...I went on my first roller coaster in Euro Disney at the age of 47 ...Space Mountain.That was awesome..|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	It would be a nice twist on the Vomit Comet from NASA.|`|AM0SieZLaa	When I was reading that I was like . . OMG that sounds fun!<br>  But you made it up! :( LOL.<br>  Yeah I sure do like the idea, not very safety prone though but still, well done! :]
jhNUuz0maa	They did have Transformers that you could connect to make a larger robot.<br>  <br>  Another was Voltron, there were two different kinds, but not sure if there was a falcon one.<br>  <br>  Then there were GoBots, but I don't recall making a huge model out of them.|`|x30Pwy6eaa	I think youre talking about a certain type of Transformers called the "Predacons", that were a sub-group of the Decepticons, that transforms in a Big Robot Called "Predaking".<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.

You just need to refresh and cross your fingers<br>  <br>  Lunatri's are the only L.E. pet that will not be found in the pound, if users attempt to pound it will run away|`|co0z9Lp6aa	It is.
769e50f08cc5813d11f23a96eaac7104aa	i will tell you that when the sea monster ate me it caught me off guard and scared me a little but ive played well into the space stage and  of course the music is sort of repetitive, but nothing scary or creepy. i personally think space stage was designed well and could only be better if your ally's wouldnt ask for help every 5 minutes.
DtkLsetkaa	It is my least favorite expac.  I hate the fact that the students have SO little time to do anything but study, and that you HAVE to go to college or the teen is miserable.  It put something in the game that you almost MUST do and that to me isn't the point of the Sims.  I uninstalled it.. Lots of people like it tho, so its just my opinion and I know its the minority.  So get it if you want it :)|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Uni you get to do a lot with. You can live in the dorm or rent a house. You can even join a frat. But you can't have pets and babies with out having a hack. I have them all.|`|LWLX1ha2aa	It is very nice and you only have to worry for one person which is your sim you get to live in a dorm and you take a midterm and a final exam there is four college years.<br>  You could get it for like $15.00 at walmart.|`|8Ic3r9i8aa	very cool, you can play as a whole buncha people.<br>  sometimes it gets annoying of taking care of up to 12+people, but it is cool to play a game with people in college.|`|nQwSlue1aa	I really like it. But I'd say you should just wait for Sims 3 to come out and get that. It'll be a little bit more expensive, but more advanced.|`|o2WPPUp3aa	Yeah , if you want to play your sims for an extra equivalent of an adult life-span.|`|BZrLmsalaa	no
5ag4Og6vaa	Etsy.com<br>  <br>  Everything, or mostly everything, sold there is handmade. Anyone can make an account. People buy things by the seller rating so have a relative buy something from you to give you a positive rating.|`|ad89O2nCaa	I would say ebay

1G6fvr2gaa	GeForce 9300 (GS)|`|E0djcoukaa	The GeForce 9300 GS is the best of the 3. They're not top of the range, but they're good.<br>  I had a Radeon 3200 and it couldn't even play the Sims 2 properly.<br>  The GeForce 8200M is ok, a bit outdated though.<br>  So your best bet is the 9300 GS. It's still a very good card.|`|X92FdfPeaa	Try the one that is the newest and most expensive.|`|XNJ8xCvWaa	what? was it out today?
fdb0c3b52694d39c6cc1024dfb404380aa	well mine isn't all that interesting, but I'm dying to learn how to crochet or knit|`|SdHqyWKHaa	Personally, I'd learn how to weld, which is definitely impressive but not a good party trick. Card tricks, juggling, magic tricks and yo-yo tricks all get people's attention if you learn to do them well and, unlike welding, they're suitable for most living rooms.|`|AA12177717	I'd like to learn wood carving and ballroom dancing, myself.

SEwqwjPkaa	When you visit the club nintendo us site you can enter your PIN from your games/systems and your account will be credited with the appropriate point value.  I've been doing this since Xmas and have had no problems.  However, it'll take a while to accumulate enough points to get anything worthwhile.  Good Luck!    Peace!  The Reverend    P.S.  Remember, not ALL games come with PINS.
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Probably in the same places as the PC version...and there are 30 pieces of intel. Unfortuntely, based on your number, you're still 22 away from having the unlimited ammo cheat.    Try going to IGN or a similar site and going to the "Cheats" tab once you've gone to the CoD4 page.    One "cheat" I'm pretty sure you can try is what's called the "Black & White Mode".    BTW: Which weapon did you use on the AC-130 mission? I've used all three, but I prefer the big BOFORS gun - even up close! ;) (40mm produces too small a burst for groups of infantry, and the vulcan seems to take forever, and the sighting system is too tight.)    Good Luck!    EDIT: One of the laptops is exceptionally difficult to find. It is in the All Ghillied-Up level when you have to carry your mate to the chopper. When the enemy choppers come in to drop the Russian Troops, a door in the S/W corner of the map is supposed to open-up to and spawn troopers. I have yet to see that door open. Supposedly you have to approach from the direction of the pool to find the door open. (And go through the gates, not hop the fence.)|`|NfsGPniJaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-vGpS1cD... Watch this, this video works for both the PC and Xbox versions.|`|qusKbEmBaa	go to google and search for cheats and collectables.|`|CSrNYeMaaa	there laptops|`|4db1BR9qaa	there is no cheat code for infinite ammo but if you get all 30 pieces of Intel you get infinite ammo...    for the locations go to http://www.gamerz-forum.com/forum/first-...    its my friends post in a blog (reliable)     do you have live???
PtfgIvnHaa	You could level your slayer, until you get monster with really good drops, and you also level combat while doing so, so it helps.    Also, you could do lvl 2-3 Treasure clue, I got 6 million from a lvl 2 clue I did in about 15 minute ( I got Ranger boots, it's pretty rare but it happens).    If you don't have alot of quest and combat skill done, you could buy Vial, fill them with water and sell them for a 100-200k profit.    There's alot of way to make money in this game, I suggest you go to the runescape forums, in the Guide section and look for a Money making guide, cause it would take a long time to write every way in here :)|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Mining is boring and tedious but will get you Runescape dosh.|`|rL6UXXjWaa	If your a member then cut down regular trees and make them into arrows shafts (best way for me)    If your not a member then you can get feathers and sell them  or get lobsters and sell them  or mine or cut trees and sell them      If you buy feathers lobsters or arrows shafts or coal or anything like   that then remember to buy low and sell high  You make alot of gold like that|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Quit playing Runescape and get a life. Maybe get a job so you can make some real Mullah.|`|U6rCN4R8aa	loser.    hey, its not anything you said not to say.|`|yxNPmoviaa	I hear Hunting is a good way, especially if you can catch Chins (theyre always in demand) I believe thats level 68?    Armadyl KC is a good way to make money, the guys you kill before you go into the Armadyl chamber.. They drop loads of Addy bars. But frankly a lot of people go there, so you'll be battling a lot between people.    Ankous at the StrongHold of Barbville drops tons of runes. Where a Salve amulet from Haunted mines quest and you hit way higher.    Any raw material skill, like mining, fishing, etc. Oh and runecrafting is good too.|`|7jp7sTdFaa	Mine. Mine all you can; get your level up insanely high, until you can mine Addy. Just get a good quality pickaxe -- you might want to start out with Mithy or Steel if your level is low -- and then go to that spot under Falador or near Rimmington and mine away. Mining coal is a really smart way to get a lot of money fast; The Falador site on a foreign, empty server is always very convenient for this.    Smithing. Once you've got a lot of extra ores, you can smelt them and then hammer then, on an anvil, into some quality armor or weapons. As usual, this will take time and practice, but its worth it in the end.    Fishing; once your level is high enough, you can catch things like lobster, swordfish, and I believe sharks.    Have fun, and good luck!|`|CSrNYeMaaa	go to a money website and pay a few $ and they will give u gold|`|24edoF3Daa	Cut wood like willows or yews. Mine coal too.|`|2YSr4Hzlaa	ok i play runescape im a level 41. what i do go around like the town center of lumbridge or varrock and say :if u can give me a job press 500" or u can mine and sell it or make bronze bars,iron,gold, etc. also u can sell wood or sell fish and that how i got my 30k so have fun and good luck.  runescape name: freshtodef2  add me if u need help i can pay u to work for me|`|LhMQi2SEaa	ok heres what you do spend all your money on clay get jugs of water use the jugs on the clay and u have soft clay|`|aYoscopKaa	Pay in cash online theres loads of sites. Do quests you get gold for them, do stuff for other people. Get new people to pay you to do stuff for them (take them around, help them with quests), sell stuff. Ohh and fight in wilderness and you get peoples stuff (keep yours in the bank when fighting) this obv helps when your levels pretty high.|`|ncQtVVg9aa	How about.... Get a life?    Runescape aint the way to enjoy life :l    Get a girlfriend, get a job and earn REAL MONEY.|`|WCfbW7lCaa	Pick Snapegrass or Seaweed. Sell it in 1k bundles.  Once you have enough to buy say 5 x 1k bundles buy the snapegrass cheap from other players, then go to the forums and advertise to sell it in large quantities.  I used to buy 1k snapegrass for 150k from players and sell it for 200k on forums. Thats 50k profit for standing outside the Ah for half an hour.    I havent played it for years so things may have changed since then.

You will not be bored and feel better about yourself|`|XQIbx7Plaa	Think about some things that are of interest to you.  Reading, going for a run, photoshopping or even surfing the web... there is a ton of great resources for things that are on here that you probably just haven't discovered yet.

3LPTLUczaa	Turn the lighting effects down, they have crap optimisation. Maybe try loosing AA as well if that doesn't help.
NiGvdObLaa	there's not a certain part since the wifi goes through the store. at the gamestop deoxys event, a person that works there said that most people just drove up there, stayed in their car, and got on the wifi and got it.    just anywhere in the store would work :3|`|iux0q5UFaa	Anywhere in the store.

f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	Currently there are no Emulators for the Xbox 360 due to technical limitations.  Sorry my friend =/.|`|KUcM5UDKaa	If you understand how an emulator works, you would know that there are none available.     An emulator only works as well as it does because the technology it emulates is very old and requires very little memory usage.     Xbox 360 games are 4-5 Gigabytes, and if it has DLC, it's even bigger.  Plus the amount of RAM and processing speed of the 360 can't be emulated, because it's current technology.    your best bet is to buy the actual pc version of a game.|`|EdP54QBYaa	Yes there are but none of them work. Trust me, they a waste of cap and I've tried it on so many of my friends computers.    Just get the 360 or upgrade your computer. Don't bother with emulators. The Gameboy emulators are the only ones that seem to work. PSP,PS2,PS3 all Epic fail ;)
AA11311094	if its for like 5 or less Dollars, go ahead
h9zzljmRaa	Yes, Piplup and Torchic is a very decent team in Mystery Dungeon:Explorers of Time that should be able to carry you through many of the main storyline battles.  Their stats are pretty good and they both learn decent attacks.  All in all, this is a very versatile team that should be able to handle the challenges of the storyline in MD:EoT.    Hope this helps :)
Y7c7WNd6aa	Uhh they're supposed to be the 4 best trainers in the world of pokemon. You have to beat them and the champion one after another in order to beat the game. They're really tough and have pokemon of one common type. Sydney uses dark type, Phoebe uses ghost type, Glacia uses ice and the last guy(who's name I cant remember) uses dragons. Steven, the champion, uses steel type.

Wxr3mIRnaa	Well son, <br>  <br>  What processor and graphics card does your comp have? If it's really poor this might be the reason... <br>  <br>  And when you play runescape, try not to have any other things on, antivirus, other pages etc etc, might mess with the graphics... <br>  <br>  And if you have a real lousy connection, it hangs and show's a black screen.. nothing uncommon.. happens to me alot... buy  a better itnernet package.. that would solve the prob.. <br>  <br>  Well this is all the advice i can give.. <br>  <br>  GOod luck!|`|Tq98g20raa	well my expert advice would be .... QUIT|`|zcUE6f4Oaa	Urmm, stop playing it?
C62F31Dwaa	Games are meant to be played by everyone. Girls have a equal right at playing them freely, even start a group on a online game or something. Play away gals, play away.|`|stHol8ITaa	Of course it's okay. Why wouldn't it be? It might be minority, but I wouldn't call it weird by a long shot.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Don't worry about those teasing you... they're been sexist against their own gender. Remind them it's the 21st Century, and woman aren't expected to strictly fit into the "feminine mold" anymore.

8TttaNc3aa	i used to have the same problem. what you do is start a garden around your house and in the summer. there should be lots of bugs. ladybugs, orchid mantises, stuff like that. you have to look real close. also. at night, there could be rare bugs on the trees. oooo and if your looking for money, make sure you have your net with you and then go shake down trees. if a bee comes out get to a good place to swing your net. press pause. equip your net, then (even though there r bees all around you) press pause and then immediatly start pressing the net button. if your lucky ull catch a bug worth like 5000 bells. dont worry if u cant get it on your first try. it takes practice|`|G3ScsO6haa	u find them on trees and on the floor on flowers and u catch them with a net u can buy them from tom nook and step  about a 2 steps away from the tree.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|i5cJ4LSnaa	you have to buy a net from tom nooks, and you can find them almost anywhere, they come out at day and night depending on what they are, look around the trees,<br>  to use the net you have to equip it and then double tap your person to swing it or press a; just like a fishing net, watering can, shovel, catapult etc..<br>  hope that helps! ^_^

KtBfxkNAaa	The Assault has to be the best. With the best scope you can almost become a sniper with an assault rifle. But why not be both with the overkill perk. I use that and carry an assault rifle and a sniper rifle. Use the assault rifle while moving to a different sniping location instead of the pistol. It also gives you the chance to mix up your style while having both weapons available.|`|90Zieeglaa	Hardcore Team Deathmatch<br>  <br>  G3 Red Dot/Silencer<br>  USP Silenced<br>  <br>  Bandolier<br>  UAV Jammer<br>  Last Stand/Dead Silence<br>  <br>  Normal Team Deathmatch<br>  <br>  P90 Red Dot/Silencer<br>  Desert Eagle<br>  <br>  Bandolier<br>  Stopping Power<br>  Steady Aim<br>  <br>  If you are a good sniper<br>  <br>  M40A3<br>  USP Silenced<br>  <br>  Claymore<br>  Stopping Power<br>  Iron Lungs/Deep Impact<br>  <br>  If You Are An Assault Sniper<br>  <br>  M40A3 ACOG<br>  USP<br>  <br>  Bandolier<br>  Stopping Power/Slight Of Hand (Slight Of Hand For Hard Core)<br>  Steady Aim (NOOO SCOOOOOOPES)<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  --->Neil|`|8AYigk5faa	Defiantly sniper!!! very effective and fun, so much blood <br>  <br>  or maybe a shotgun. hehe always fun to blow people away with a shoty!!!!|`|VJtadJtxaa	sniper all the way, especially on OVERGROWN and CROSSFIRE
sX8SD7N9aa	Paladins are pretty good. A mild mix between Warrior and Mage. Paladins can use magic and MP and most of they're magic are stat boosters and heals. They can use up to plate armor. They have pretty good attacking skills and I think that they're main weapon is a mace or a club. That's all I know.|`|yubRUIWqaa	Here is my guide to learning the paladin.<br>  A paladin is one of the two "Master of role" classes in the game meaning (like the druid) they can heal, tank, or dps.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Decide whether you want to Heal, Tank, or Dps in you raids or instances. Also, please be aware that your decision can always be changed in the future.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Make sure you assemble your UI according to what spec. For leveling, holy paladins use seal of righteousness as well as holy shock, concecrete and shield of righteousness. Judgement of wisdom works here because you can easily heal yourself. <br>  Retribution - Crusader strike, Divine storm, and Judgement are your primary abilities. Concecrete is a mana burn and I do not reccomend you use it. Seal of command works best for leveling as well as judgement of light,<br>  Prot - Blessing of sanctuary on yourself, judge wisdom, and use seal of wisdom. This combination will ensure you have infinite mana so you can use your other abilities like Hammer of the Righeous, concecrete, and holy shield without having to worry about going out of mana.<br>  <br>  That is the basic guide, the rest YOU MUST LEARN ON YOUR OWN. If you level a class from 1 to 80, you will posses knowledge of the class greater than any guide can ever teach you. Good luck fellow paladin.|`|xXNZCJr7aa	Don't use it. Make a level 1 and level it.. learn the class. Once you get it down then you could probably go to the 75. Nobody likes playing with a guy that can't play his toon.. and someone telling you how isn't going to make you good. Only way to get good is to practice!<br>  <br>  But I think that the only attack a holy [HEALING] pally has is judgement of [light/thewise/justiceorwhatever..it's your choice really one which you need to use.] and consecrate.<br>  <br>  I have a paladin myself but I've never played it as holy. I've always been ret or prot. If you have the gear, you might want to respec and finish leveling as ret or prot since it'll be waaaaay faster than holy unless you have someone to level with... but you'll probably find instance groups easier as holy. ;)|`|hpEFHZuZaa	<a href="http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/</a><br>  <br>  An awesome, free WoW guide, that has all different kinds of guides including class guides, gold-making guides, leveling guides, achievement guides, etc.<br>  <br>  hope it helps.|`|npkLIKPUaa	:O<br>  Make a new paladin and learn from the level 1?<br>  Thats what i did to play my bf paladin

0lK1dPjnaa	Get them to sit in chairs or relax on beds for a while. Sometimes you can call into work and say your sick or just take the day of if you have vacation days available. Also avoid making them go outside especially when it rains or snows if you have Seasons.<br>  You can prevent chills by making them wear outdoor clothes outside. If they get too cold, bring them outside and give them hot chocolate or have them take a bath.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Illness<br>  Illnesses can be caused for several reasons. Sims can get food poisoning from undercooked or overcooked food, they can catch the flu or colds from being outside at night without much clothes on, etc. There will be no visual clue that a Sim is sick aside from a pop-up window in the corner.<br>  <br>  To fix an illness, have your Sim relax in bed and lounge on the couch as much as possible. Avoid anything active, and do your best not to study for any job skills. Sims normally heal after a day or so.<br>  <br>  If a Sim is sick, they can call work via the phone. If a Sim calls in sick, they don't have to go to work, but they don't get paid that day.|`|2Oo5f1dMaa	All you need to do is make sure that they get plenty of rest (e.g sleep alot and relax on the sofa) and you have to make sure that they're clean all the time (e.g take at least 2 showers a day) and in a few days they should be well again.<br>  Also if it's winter , make sure they don't go outside because it's cold and they would get even more ill.|`|1QMhfJ6Laa	make sure they don't stand up for too long. the best thing is to make them sleep, but if they have too much energy, make them read a book on the couch or bed. to prevent it from happening again, keep them away from vermin and call the exterminator.|`|Egszyk9Jaa	Well one way is to just let them rest a lot and don't let them on their feet too much.

eaIA6KSvaa	put the difficulty on very hard and try to discover every location in the wasteland...loot have fun and if you're still bored, try starting the game over with opposite karma then do it all again and note the differences.  You can buy DLC's too if you have Xbox 360 or PC.  Some places that were my favortites from fallout are vault 106, national Guard Depot, Nuka Cola Factory,  Red Racer Factory.  When you go anywhere read all of the terminals because they tell the story and will make the place seem much more interesting.  hope this is what you were looking for.

COFPXYvZaa	1. No, the new weapons do not carry over from one story to another. the grenade launcher will only stay in L&D.<br>  <br>  2. yes, the original cheats will work in L&D. there are also some new cheats as well (just vehicle spawns, nothing else). however, I do not know if these new cheats will work in niko's story (I doubt it).<br>  <br>  3. description kinda vague. you could be talking about new pipe bombs (which are almost the exact thing as the original grenades). you might also be talking about the sawed-off shotgun, one of the new guns. you'll be able to use this in a vehicle as well as on foot (and it's quite powerful). it's available in both single and multiplayer, and it's only available in L&D.<br>  <br>  4. if you want to switch between the original and L&D, you'll have to set up save files from both games (for example, the original game in slot 1, L&D in slot 2). you can then load between both at will (note that it takes some time to load if you're switching games). <br>  <br>  5. I'll have to say that it's worth $20. the storyline is satisfying (despite being 1/3 the original storyline), the new multiplayer options are entertaining, and the new weapons, vehicles and songs make it very worth it.|`|T17pbHVJaa	1) You can use the previous weapons that Niko had with TLAD, plus new weapons, but you cannot use the new weapons in GTA4 with Niko<br>  <br>  2) I never cheat, so I dunno about that.<br>  <br>  3) As far as I can tell from playing for 2 evenings, it's multiplayer chopper only. I took a chopper up in TLAD single player and no explosive rounds. No new content gets moved over to GTA4<br>  <br>  4) You cannot play Niko in TLAD, only Johnny - you cannot switch players, Niko for GTA4, Johnny for TLAD.<br>  <br>  5) Yes. It's an ad-on, not a new game, but worth the $20.|`|8zE2gjReaa	its worth the $20. No doubt, its getting all good reviews, most are 4.5/5 or higher. It has at least 10 hours of missions and game play. like over 10 new vehicles. Most of them are bikes. but no surprise there. All weapons will carry over and then there are some new ones added to the LaD. Don't know about cheats. Probably though because its a DLC (down loadable Content) add-on not actually a new game. And I'm not sure about switching the characters. But its the best DLC ever for the 360. Highly recommended. And its a great value
XIIiGv4Jaa	Hmm... Your best bet would be SecondLife I think, it's free and there is a large group of vampire lovers in the game.

It is just a rumor.<br>  <br>  : )|`|PGv3srOmaa	ok i know how to beat Lt Surge with taking very minimal damage. go find a geodude and get it to about lvl 30 ( becomes graveler at 25 ) . it will be wicked easy for you because it wont take all that lightning damage.|`|UM51slpRaa	you should be alright if you get them all to lvl 20 but i would make sure theyre all between lvl 22-25 just to be sure.|`|XE0wIUTyaa	lol yes that is a good team, though aside from just training bulbasaur and charmander, pidgeotto (when evolves into pidgeot) is a very powerful pokemon, so certainly improve his level. Other than that, you have a good balance of different type of pokemon, a strong grass pokemon, strong water (when magicarp evolves to garydos with i believe a water stone), and who could forget the classic pikachu =D|`|poqgew3Uaa	I would level up nidoking as he is a valuable pokemon against thunder. Magikarp is out for this gym to weak against thunder. Try the Safari park and use the glitch of standing on one patch of grass and tapping the move button lightly not sure if that works on yellow (I play them all lol) Also what is the mew glitch? could you add it as additional details.|`|R65OcMaUaa	good team but be careful of ground type moves, they can devistate 1/2 your party another thing lvl up your pokemon higer than the gym leader at this point itll help for the rest of the game, plus beating surge isnt that difficult (beat him with a pidgeot lol) but be careful pack a few potions and you should be fine|`|QObO5q0aaa	well why dont you just train them and you need to get magikarp out of ur team that pokemon really sucks so train in the wild and level all of ur pokemon to a good level. the level u want to be to beat the gim leader is all ur pokemon to level 20 and if u dont want to spend much time with all of them just train 2-3 pokemon that are ur best ones and train them to level 25 and u will beat the team leader ok.|`|Del5F0anaa	Yeah its a pretty decent team,<br>  except you shouldn't have evolved your nidorino just yet.<br>  <br>  Magikarp isn't obviously the best type to use against electric but apart from that its a very good team ^_^|`|vqJTgq4kaa	you need to get all you monsters at least level 20.

Tk29jePpaa	You are going to have to go get the xbox 360 hard drive. Without it you cannot connect to xbl.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Fortunately, purchasing a hard drive is NOT your only option.  Although it's the more preferred of the two options, it's not really a requirement.  The 512MB memory card will do the trick for you and if you have an arcade or core system, you can get one at a reduced price, or perhaps even free from Microsoft.  Google xbox live experience along with free memory card and you'll get some results for xbox.com which should lead you to the details about the offer.<br>  <br>  However, please be aware that in order to save games, download DLC, movies, audio, multimedia, etc. you'll need to upgrade to at least the 20GB HDD.  In the end, the 512MB card is only going to get you on live...and that's about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!  Peace!<br>  The Reverend|`|N5LM2wRdaa	You probably dont have a hard drive i am guessing.

b1coALxbaa	I'm not familiar with a Night of the Living Dead game, but the movie was awesome so I'm just going to suggest some zombie games to you, hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 5 is coming out pretty soon, looks pretty awesome gonna need to fire up the xbox 360 for this one.<br>  <br>  Left 4 Dead is blood awesome co op / vs. (much better on PC than console thanks to the modding community)<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 4 (great game you can get this on PC as well, I highly suggest modding it to have higher resolution textures / mouse control..etc..)<br>  <br>  the House of the dead games are pretty fun if a bit on the extremely cheesy side.<br>  <br>  There's an old Half Life 1 mod called "They Hunger" which had three episodes that were all VERY good for the time.<br>  <br>  In addition to the old mod, there's a new game coming out (supposedly sometime this year) from the same guys using the Source engine (half life 2 engine) called "They Hunger: Lost Souls"  it takes place in the 60's making it slightly more similar to Night of the Living Dead. <br>  <br>  Many other games feature zombies or zombie like horror / action.<br>  <br>  I highly suggest Dead Space it features strategic dismemberment and had a good story, I suggest reading the 6 issue comics and watching the hour and a half Anime "Dead Space Downfall" before you play the game to really set yourself up for the action.  (this mixes science fiction with the zombie survival horror thing though)<br>  <br>  the Half Life games themselves have these creatures called "head crabs" that attach themselves to a person's face and once the body goes necrotic due to a puncture to the brain / suffocation the body re-animates at the control of the creature.  (not traditional zombies for sure, but provides a zombie killing / survival experience.)<br>  <br>  There's another Half Life 1 mod that may or may not still be supported called "Brain Bread" that features zombie survival.<br>  <br>  There was a really bad zombie survival game based on the movie Land of the dead.  It was called "Land of the Dead: Fiddler's green" there were no hordes of zombies (maybe 7 or 8 at a time) and it was extremely easy.  again it was a very BAD game.<br>  <br>  Dead Rising is another zombie game, a more traditional one in the way of the zombies being slow moving very romero like.  Great game its for xbox 360, the sequel is in the works right now, so might wanna pick that one up. <br>  <br>  Doom 3 sports zombies as well, I suggest playing it if you never have, Doom 4 is in the works so I'm sure that'll have them as well.  These again aren't necessarily your traditional romero zombie they're soldiers..etc.. on a mars base that get turned into undead (more intelligent than basic zombies) by a hell gate..etc..<br>  <br>  and speaking of Hellgates, there are zombies in Hellgate london (not the best game but it is a fun hack n' slash style game sporting zombies, hell, all manner of horror creatures.)  <br>  <br>  out of all of these I'd suggest you play the following if looking for that horror experience:<br>  <br>  The Resident Evil games.<br>  Dead Space<br>  Left 4 Dead<br>  Doom 3<br>  They Hunger (the half life mods)<br>  They Hunger: Lost souls (when it releases)<br>  Dead Rising<br>  <br>  Less horror but still fun:<br>  <br>  Half Life games<br>  House of the Dead|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Well if you are looking for zombie killing games then there are plenty. Depending on your platform you can look at resident evil or dead rising, the latter of which focuses less on story lines and more on endless zombie carnage. There is also Left 4 Dead, which is a great shooter with awesome game play.|`|PGv3srOmaa	im sorry i dont know what system night of the living dead comes from but id recommend<br>  <br>  Xbox 360- Left 4 Dead<br>  <br>  Wii- House of the Dead
ZsnelFnkaa	no i dont think so, i sat here for 10 minutes thinking and i cant think of anygame. i mean there are some really great games out there but none that surpass The orcarina of time|`|WbVE1cXKaa	yep.  haven,t found one yet that is better in my opinion.  The perfect mix of battle fun and mental challenge.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	You are correct. There has never been a better game than OoT. Even Twilight Princess couldn't compare. The gameplay was just far too long that most players just gave up before finishing it.<br>  <br>  Okami tried to be like Zelda, but the gameplay was far too repetitive. I am debating trading it back in before even beating it.<br>  <br>  Fable 2 and Fallout 3 both are GREAT rpg games, but their storylines cannot compare to Zelda's.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell: No, Oot is still the best game ever created. : )|`|Del5F0anaa	Haha someone actually compared ocarina of time to cod4 ?<br>  cod4 sucks.<br>  <br>  No game will EVER surpass ocarina,<br>  i just hope they don't try and re-create it.|`|MFp1AELqaa	probably not unles cod 4 multiplayer

As well as far more exclusive titles.<br>  <br>  It's an easy pick for me.  1000>200.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	It is definately all preference. It depends on what type of gamer you are and which games you enjoy. I have never been a playstation fan, I have always had nintendo systems and the original xbox. However I now own a PS3 and it is one of the best systems I have ever owned. It is far more reliable then the 360 which has caused problems for everyone I know who owns one. <br>  <br>  People make a big deal about the online play being better on 360, but the only real difference is you don't have to pay for playstation which i feel is awesome. Obviously the 360 server is much larger but as far as the actual game play I think ps3 is just as good.<br>  <br>  Once again its all really personal preference but in my opinion ps3 is a far superior system. ( By the way I own a ps3, xbox 360, 2 wii's, every nintendo system from original to the wii, so I have experience with everything).|`|6eROUvT1aa	very good idea, i just sold my xbox 360 elite for a ps3, it was biggest mistake ever, xbox 360 is way better, so yes i'de recommend you do.|`|peKTF4uIaa	xbox 360 all the way|`|LPplfTKVaa	No way keep the ps3 I mean if there is a problem with it then sure sell it or some thing but the xbox is not as good a quality as the ps3 and the xbox overheats way quicker. in my view if you are set on buying a 360 for the halo games i would be with you but i would keep the ps3, you have one now use it until it burns out THEN take it back and get a 360|`|JAp72R5raa	I have both consoles and both have their benefits.<br>  <br>  Xbox360 has better online play and more choice of games, but the system is very unreliable and is prone to the 'RROD' red ring of death, I've had mine repaired twice in 18 months.<br>  <br>  PS3 is an awesome multimedia machine, it plays blu-ray discs brilliantly, has enough choice of games to keep me happy and exceptional graphics and sound.<br>  and now PSHome is a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose only one of them I would have to go for the PS3 because it can do everything an xbox can and more.<br>  <br>  If you can afford an xbox without having to sell your PS3 I'd go for that option.|`|rndrIjkyaa	NO. Don't do it. The PS3 is a machine, a 360 is a toy. You're missing out.

SEwqwjPkaa	I've only experienced that once previously.  And at that time, the only answer I got from the XBOX community was that the error was the result of a communication error.  Their suggestion was to log off, restart the console, log back on, and try again.  This method of resolution worked perfectly for me.  If you're not able to get it done using the same method, perhaps you should contact Microsoft at 800-4my-xbox.<br>  <br>  Peace and good luck!<br>  The Reverend

W6LGsQC8aa	That is a decent party, however having only 3 pokemon is not the best, you should try to level some others as well. <br>  <br>  As far as Earthquake goes it is one of the most powerful moves in the game and especially against a fire type pokemon such as blaziken. As far as Swellow goes though Earthquake should be ineffective against him since he is a flying type pokemon.<br>  <br>  The best strategy would be level you Wailmer a little more and possibly go for a grass type pokemon to help you in the fight.

ELovXY9Paa	there are several games such as PBR that allow you to connect your ds and your wii for in-game interaction.  however, on the wii you can also download the Nintendo Channel from the wii shop channel, and this will allow you to download game demos from your wii to your ds.  <br>  So it is possible to link the wii and the ds, but there's not really much to do.  And the DS lite works exactly the same way the original DS does when you're connecting.|`|ZZR30G7raa	you can on certain games (e.g. pokemon battle revolution) but it's nothing epic, and pkmn BR is TERRIBLE.

ELovXY9Paa	what processor do you have?  You may just need to run a virus scan.  Realtek 6.0 is just an audio driver, it doesn't really apply to the game.  Try running the game by itself (no other software running), and see if the problem is any different.  If you've modified your COD4 files, then punkbuster might be kicking you out.  If you can't figure it out, try reinstalling the game, and if that doesn't work, call or email activision and complain loudly.  They WILL help you until your problem is solved.|`|92mVvHIuaa	If you are trying to play online you need to have playstation network and internet connection.

ajEuk4MTaa	The best reason to own a PS3 is for bluray. If you don't have an HDTV or any interest in bluray, I would say go for the 360. It has a massive library of good games, and most games that come out for PS3, also come out for 360. They also tend to be a lot more solid.<br>  <br>  The controller on the 360 also tends to last longer, and the rumble is stronger. It's also a lot easier to customize the 360, but that is my opinion. <br>  <br>  Unless you get the most expensive version of PS3, it isn't backwards compatible. 360 will play most xbox games, regardless of which version.|`|vCaCIriyaa	I think u should play wii instead becouse all xbox games are the same  alls u do is shoot people its exept with different charaters and the guns are the same in every game but they look diferent and the maps are different and pikmin 3 is coming out and i think it is just like little big planet and u cant play mario games on xbox|`|UVTxwDnfaa	get an xbox they are way better than a ps3. all my friends argue about this and xbox wins every time. xbox has better games a better online service and better community.<br>  i have had my xbox since they first came out and have never had the red ring of death|`|2L9mQ1nPaa	In my opinion, I would go with 360.  The PS3 is good, but has a lack of originals.  The online play for the 360 is amazing as well, and $50 a year is worth it.  If your a hardcore gamer go with 360.  If your not, go with the Wii.|`|ZCe0DfFTaa	PS3 is the answer. The only good thing about the 360 is the fact that you can have parties and chat to eachother while playing other games.

ELovXY9Paa	you may as well go ahead and install it, but don't play it until you've finished the original.  The multiplayer included with warhead (crysis wars) is a great upgrade to the original crysis multiplayer, and it doesn't give away the story, so you could at least install and play crysis wars.<br>  And yes, it does change the original a good bit.  Warhead follows the path of Psycho after he and Nomad split up in the original Crysis campaign.  You should definitely play through them in order.<br>  I don't feel like typing a book AGAIN, so here's a link to my other summary of the differences in those two games.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhWpA4QuS6CzzPMSlj1XETIjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090127144413AAdFgRQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  There actually aren't any new guns in Warhead until the very last boss battle, but the game mechanics are changed a lot.  for instance, in Warhead, you don't have to press F to pick up ammo; instead, when you walk over it, he picks it up automatically.|`|S8rldtsgaa	Crysis warhead's story is happening parallel to the originals story...yes there are JUST new missions,weapons,vehicules....but the missions are better then the originals (but its too short afterwards),the new weaps are very fun to use,and the crysis wars multiplayer is fun!it doesnt changes the original game,its standalone,and its not must to play the original.u should try it ;)
RChhlmmXaa	It depends on the game, as each game will have game save files in different folders. Most likely, it would be located somewhere like this on the hard drive:<br>  C:\Program Files\Game Publisher\Game Title\saved games\<br>  <br>  I have no idea whether the directory hierarchy would look different in windows Vista, but I'd be surprised.<br>  <br>  Putting them into such a folder might work, although the folder might be harder to find than that. If you can't find the saved games folder, try looking for file in the c: drive that have the same extension (i.e. .doc, .pdf, .mp3, .sav) as the file that you have downloaded. That format will probably be specific to your game, and if you find files that are called save1 or something similar, that's probably where the saved games belong.
