If so did it show your refund was processed or did it show something ike the following:   We have received your tax return and it is being processed. Unless we find mistakes or you owe other taxes, you should receive your refund by March 3, 2009.      It has said this for us for about 1 week.  I did the E-file.  I remember doing this all the other years and it came up by now that it has been processed, etc...I am wondering if their could be problems.  I claimed my daughter and her last name has changed, but we did not catch the mistake the tax lady made by putting her old last name.  I wonder if this could hold it up - the last name not matching her social.      Thank you and Serious Answers Only Please.

20090223133737AAO5Exu	Business & Finance;Insurance	Am I eligible for Unemployment Benefits (Ma)?	Hello Y! community.       Alright this is the scenario I started working at a company back in December of 2007, my primary job was answering phones. No problem's with my job I won numerous Customer Service and Company based awards. Well in August of 2008 I got really sick constant vomiting, stomach pains, headache and more horrible symptoms. Well this lasted with me calling out and updating my manager for approx 1 1/2 weeks. My manager and the HR rep were extremely proactive on helping file for a leave but I was not there long enough to file for paid leave. Found out I was pregnant and my leave ended, so they laid me off. I didn't file until after I had a miscarriage, I explained this to the young lady and they sent me the preliminary paperwork that said per info I gave I seemed to be eligible. Now this was received beginning of January since I have been submitting claims every week but it is still being processed.      My questions are:      1. Do I have a chance in h&ll of getting approved?   2. If so, In Mass. does it typically take more than 4 weeks to hear back?   3. Could there be any reason for it taking so long? And is it typical for a rep to call back (no one has reached me at all)      Believe me I have looked for job after job. Went on active work searches even nailed a few interviews. Had a professional do my resume' and nothing. I am so scared I have no income coming in, lost my apartment, have illnesses that I am pushing aside to work and it seems like everything is against me.    Any suggestion are appreciated, Thank You all for your time and input.

20090223141516AA9pHBs	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Would you quit your job under these circumstances?	I'm getting to the point that I don't want to go to work anymore and it's worrying me because I am only 27. I have been at my job for over eight years and I'm not sure If I am tired of my job or just tired of working in general. I'm not a lazy person by any means but I feel worn out. Recently, my boss fired 2 of our office employees (cutbacks) and have put a good portion of their work on my plate. He said that he wants to add to my workload because things are slowing down due to the economy. This is fine, but my duties have yet to slow down and he is putting pressure on me for these new responsibilities that I am having a hard time finding extra time for. I already run his office and his rental  properties (separate from his business) and I manage one other employee. I feel overworked and I feel like a paid slave. The other thing that irks me his wife who has nothing better to do, makes me do her personal stuff stuff like deal with her personal insurance problems. I have to pretend I am her on the phone, which I hate. I feel this is out of the question because I was not hired as a "personal assistant" although I feel like one. She used to have me watch her kids constantly and help her clean her house and I would get yelled at by my boss for not being in the office enough. I hate when she asks me for anything anymore. I just want to scream at her and tell her to do something for herself for once. She doesn't even work. I would so quit my job if the pay wasn't reasonablly good. If I leave I will likely have to take a signifigant pay cut and I am used to living on what I make now. I'm trying to decide if I should "spread my wings" and work somehwere else regardless of a pay cut. Anyone else feel this way about their job?

I work in a call center as a supervisor, recently a manager came up to me asking me to follow up with a call taking rep who is not on my team.  I am supposed to follow up with him to let him know that it has been noticed that he is not "cleaning up after himself" (manager's words) after using the bathroom - meaning he isn't flushing #2s and supposedly leaving "used" toilet paper on the floor.  They picked me because I am the only male supervisor and they think it would be better coming from another male.  If you must ask how we know it is him, he was noticed by our janitor as the only one leaving the bathroom at around the time of the discoveries (this has happened more than several times).  How would you handle this in the most HR friendly way possible?

20090223143921AAz8a3w	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	What are my legal options?	I purchased a 5-1 printer from a local Radio Shack. When I purchased the printer, I also bought a repair or replace warranty good for one year. In December, my printer needed repair. When I took the printer to Radio Shack, the store manager did not want to honor my warranty, stating that it was expired. Once I proved to him it wasn't, he then proceeded to ship my printer off to the repair site in Texas. A few days after shipping the printer, I received a call from the store manager saying he received an e-mail from FedEx stating that my printer was damaged before it made it to the repair site. Then, I had to report to the store and fill out a claim form for my printer. The store manager faxed the form to the repair site. He informed me that this process would take 5-7 business days. Two weeks past and I received no call from FedEx. I then called Radio Shack, spoke to the store manager and got my tracking and claim number. So, I contacted FedEx and requested to speak to someone in claims. Apparently, my claim was sitting on a desk of a claims rep and had not been processed. Another day passes by and still no word from FedEx. I then proceeded to get FedEx and the store manager on the phone via 3-way. The billing department asked the store manager for a quote of the value of the printer. The store manager stated $250. All was to be taken care of, so I thought. Yet another day passes and no check or printer is in my possession. Again, I call FedEx and by this time, I have become irate. I speak to the Senior Claims Rep for FedEx and contact the store manager again, via 3-way. They were in a debate about a invoice that needed to be received from Radio Shack with the quote of the printer value. I have become even more angered because this was supposed to take 5-7 days and it has been two months. The store manager calls me the same night and offers another printer for the same price. I refuse to accept the printer because I want to take my business elsewhere. Last week, I receive a call from a Risk Management Rep from Radio Shack in Texas, telling me to contact her to arrange a settlement. To this day, I have left her three messages, one even leaving my e-mail address to contact me and I have not received a call from anyone. I am thinking about taking this to small claims court. What are my legal options. Any sound advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hi   According to the company i work for Im self employed but the company tell me when and where to work at their premises using their equipment.   I read somewhere that this means i am technically really an employee of the company and if they are not paying tax & NIC for me then it is their responsibility and they would be liable if caught. is that correct or i would i be in trouble if i didn't pay?      also what really happens if you did get caught?   some say its a fine for less than the tax, ￡60 a day penalty, prison, or just makes you pay what you owe. ccjs, seems to be different for everyone!      thanks!

20090223153203AA6X2hd	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I include this job on my resume's work history?	I'm applying to several banks around town for a teller position. I only have two retail jobs (college convenience store and a small produce stand) listed in my resume that I have worked at for about 2 years each. Before I had those 2 jobs, I held a cashier/photo tech position at a department store for 3 years. I quit that position without giving 2 weeks notice, but I feel that my resume will look empty if I don't add that job to my work experience. I basically had that job for that first couple of years that I went to college.      Do you suggest that I leave that job out of my resume? Or do you all suggest that I leave it in? If I were to leave it in, how would I explain why I left, without looking bad? I left that job because my boss was a jerk and because I could not stand being around one of my coworkers anymore (those two made my life very stressful, I could not work as efficiently as I used to anymore). It's not like everyone gives their notice before they quit their job!       Even though I disliked some of the people at that job, I feel that omitting this part of my work history would be a waste. This is because I feel that I got my most and best retail experience at that place. The other two jobs that I had were less complicated.      Thanks in advance for all the constructive feedback.

20090223153657AA7b0RC	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	What is the least costly way of sending money from either Europe or Japan to the US?	I have a French friend now living in Japan who owes me about 600 euro (about US $900). He is a trustworthy guy & we're good friends so I'm not worried about getting my money back. I want to remind him to pay me back but also want to suggest a way for him to send me money. He can send it either from France or Japan. Online seems like it would be the cheapest, but what safe & secure website(s) is or are the cheapest for cross-currency transfers (ie from euro or yen to US dollar)? I want to avoid paypal because they are pretty expensive & with their currency exchange rates, probably even more so. I used to use moneybookers, but now they don't allow non-US to US money transfers.
20090223153907AA5J1hO	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Why is the amount on my Form 1098-T different from the actual amount of financial aid I received?	Our CPA is trying to fill out our tax report, and he asked for my Form 1098-T so that my parents could receive education credit for me, since I am claimed by them as a dependent.    But the amount on the form 1098-T reported by my school is much less than the actual amount of loans,grants,scholarship that I received.   I know that scholarships and government grants aren't tax deductible, and that those 2 might have been excluded on the form, but it still doesn't add up. Why is this?   Will I receive less credit than I'm supposed to?

I am expecting in late August. The baby's father is going to do his share in the baby's life but is having trouble finding a job. I have insurance with everything I need through my grandparents. The father is trying to find a job so the baby will have the same.      But my question is what if he doesn't find a job in time, or one that doesn't have insurance? How can I go about getting my baby insured    because my grandparents can not insure us both unless they adopt the baby and I would not want that.   I'm not very educated on this subject and would really like some advice. Thank you all very much in advance

En primera instancia pareciera ser esto logico, pero pretende olvidar con ese argumento que debe de proveer toda la informacion referente a su producto, ya que con esa actitud en un pais con la falta de presencia de un gobierno se legitima el "robo de cuello blanco" y a quienes lo practican ostentan el nobre de empresarios, siendo que la legislacion no los considera como enrriquesimiento en prejuicio de la otra persona, pero si lo vemos que es a millones de personas a las que roban cada 30 dias; entoces tenemos que roban mes a mes millones de pesos a un poblacion. Si los de PUBLI XIII ubieran escrito letras muy chiquitas al final de sus convenios como lo hacen los bancos talvez no tuvieran los problemas legales que tienen; ya que pudieron argumentar "ellos sabian que los carros se tenian que pagar, y el pago corresponde a quien tiene el auto"
