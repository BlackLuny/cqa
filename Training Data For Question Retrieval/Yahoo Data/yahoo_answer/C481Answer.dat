AA10003191	Sure sounds like it. Drink cranberry juice & see a doctor.
vR7fzZkXaa	Yes! you can get your period at any weight you are!!|`|iPcO4kmKaa	yupp|`|qbbNtGVcaa	you probably can. usually girls get theirs around 100 lbs. so you might get it soon. but if your anorexic haha then pro ably not! :)|`|AA12385489	Yes.|`|ru4wtKFsaa	As long as your not Anorexic, you won't have trouble getting your period. Here's a link to see if you are on an average weight.     http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/...    SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN|`|ygELhfO6aa	It depends. Are you underweight? How tall are you? How old are you? And blah blah blah...if you are underweight, you will not get your period. Once, I lost only 5 pounds and I skipped my period for 2 months.
D4NOrqM7aa	if you have painful bumps...try honey.  if you put a glob of honey over a painful zit over night the swelling will reduce, as will size and redness.  honey can also be used every other day as a mask. it will clear your acne, lessen acne scars, and even your skin tone!    good luckerzz=]|`|EivEhi8Gaa	I highly recommend the Clearasil Tinted Acne Treatment cream.  I know you have tried Clearasil, but if you haven't tried this cream, I'd definitely try it. Also, if you don't want to try that or already have and it didn't work, you could try the Burt's Bee Herbal Blemish stick. Both of those things have worked great for me. I trade off on which one I use about every couple of months. They are under $8 each, I believe. So they're not too expensive.

Also wear support socks to reduce swelling & heal pain. C a sports physio too.
pTbGI4sZaa	Passing is usually 70% on ARC tests.  For most classes, there are "A" and "B" tests - the difference is the order of the questions and wording, they are alternates and you will only have to take 1 if you pass.  Most instructors will give you the alternate test if you fail.      You need to ask your instructor about getting your card.
vR7fzZkXaa	yea sometimes that happens to me. I have no clue what it is. I wish i did know|`|FiKniDMjaa	ok, what exactly do u mean? does something come out or does it just hurt a lot?|`|QsD9VOMYaa	that happens to me to lol. I dont know what it could be though|`|rE9J1DqTaa	lol omg me to no joke. I herd it was because the muscles you use to hold in your pee are the same ones you use during sexual intercourse
OtiTiVDNaa	Well get motivated ,   1 first day is the hardest so just try to push yourself once and then its going to turn up into a routine.  2. Get a friend who is also sharing the same interest and help you out while working out.  3. Get an mp3 and play your favourite songs on it while you do cardio  4. Try if you can get into competitions, like cycling or marathon or similar, which is probably the best motivation booster ever.    Good luck!|`|fmeuE91Paa	This is a technique that anorexic/bulemic people use but I find that it works for people who want to loose wieght and exercise the healthy way lol. Find pictures of your favorite models/actresses or people who have the body that you want and save them somewhere(on a computer, post them on your walls, etc.). Just buy a few magazines and rip out the pages where you find a body that you'd like to end up having and place it somewhere where you can see it. It will help motivate you because you can tell yourself "if I go out and excercise I can end up having her body" lol. Hope this helps.|`|ckpVwS5Uaa	tyju6ty|`|3unTnZhfaa	I'm in the same boat with regards to lack of motivation, so what I suggest is to find someone who will exercise with you. Team sports are always more fun and get you motivated since you've got people waiting for you rather than you relying on yourself to get up off the couch. Some of my friends have tried joining up for the gym, using 'wasted money for gym membership' as a motivating factor.     Always try and mix it up, go swimming one day, run around with friends and play frisbee or something the next. Cross trainers and treadmills get pretty boring after a few weeks so try putting some different music on your stereo or ipod when you go for a run.    Hope this helps and good luck!|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Put some music on that you really love and pump it up really loud mate ........ i like putting ACDC's "A whole lotta Rosie" on and leaping wildly around my living room jamming on down on my air guitar pretending i'm up on stage with all the boys in the band having the time of my life ........... do that for 15 - 20 minutes a couple of times a day and tell me you don't feel freaking fabulous .......... gets the serotonin pumping through your brain and de frizzles you as well as getting up a healthy sweat.    peace baby  ?
z0OSXFoTaa	I would suggest doing some stair steppers, assuming of course you have stairs in your home. Crunches are a great way to knock off love handles, start out with 5 to 10 and work up to 20 per session. you should try to fit in a minimum of two session a day. Get a Yoga ball and exercise with it, it will also make you very flexible. When you go shopping look at the calorie counts, try to maintain a 1000 cal/day diet, this is very easy to do.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|BCgp7GTpaa	Cardio!  Even if you have to do jumping jacks for fifteen minutes and  then walk up and down stairs for fifteen minutes.     Also add either fruits of vegies to every meal!!

Remember its all about cardio.|`|1nIeHzofaa	Most people don't have six pack abs because they focus too much on working out.  You will never lose those love handles without healthy eating habits.  Not dieting! That's short term.  You need to change forever.  I went from a size 36 waist to 31/32 and from 200 pounds down to 170 (6'1" tall) with a tone body.  I do push ups, pull ups, chin ups, and sit ups.  I only eat foods that are low in fat and almost no saturated fat, whole grains, low fat protein (fish, soy, yogurt, beans) and a lot of fruits and vegetables.  Replace butter and mayo with olive oil. Your BMI will begin to decrease to an acceptable range for your height and weight and you will begin to see those abs as the fat in your body decreases.  Don't cheat..ever..that's where people fail.|`|ckpVwS5Uaa	crunches, oatmeal, and fruites:)|`|RVqw1C8baa	im going thru the same except im not 138 im around 118.   well you can do lots of aerobics, maybe buy a dvd and do the excercising thing, eat in moderation and drink lots of water, instead of eating 3 big meals try 6 small ones and dont eat just cuz ur bored. good luck!|`|rmkganLQaa	the normal, healthy weight for a 5'6" female is 118-155 pounds. you are well within those parameters, and you're not even on the high end of the spectrum. if you want to lose inches, you have to loose them all over. it's hard to target one area for weight loss, so do lots of cardio and avoid foods that you know are bad for you. eat lots of fruits instead of candy/sweets, and eat vegetables for sides instead of fries or chips or something else bad for you. good luck!
qbbNtGVcaa	haha i have the same problem. its normal. its probably cuz your going so long without food. who cares its not like your not eating or anything. every ones's stomach growls haha :)|`|iPcO4kmKaa	icky. my stomach growls weni m not even hungry. ppl think i like farted but i really didnt just my stupid stomach!!!! try eating more at breakfast.
5Qo6OWNzaa	my recommendation is phase 1 of Atkins. You can read about it and do it by going to www.atkins.com. Its free. It would be the fastest way to safely lose weight. In fact, on the site there are links to independent research that shows Atkins is THE fastest way to lose weight in the first 12 months of the program. After that, the rest of the programs start catching up.|`|I5BXiTzLaa	I have many weight loss tips in my blog:  http://rorysblogspot.blogspot.com/|`|hpadhXUiaa	First check out what is your blood group and what diet is good for your health .

If your looking for short term, any food or drink that's a diuretic will help you lose water weight.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|5K7zq7tjaa	diet and excerise  eat your food in SMALL amounts  GOOD LUCK!!!
AA10025824	There's a lot of different things that could be.  Strep throat to Mono and a whole bunch more but it usually means your fighting some kind of infection.  You need to have a doctor check it out.|`|DbWpGJLfaa	Mono from kissing other people, is how you get swollen glands 1 way|`|KBmhGxumaa	i would go see a doctor about that because it could become something serious|`|ssHzAVlwaa	You might have a thyroid condition.

3c90ab9bfffe34bff700221249b00257aa	It comes from the old French word "clapier" meaning a brothel, and it usually refers to gonorrhoea. The banging bricks or rocks together story is common and dramatic, but unlikely, even given the primitive state of medicine in the premodern era.    I suspect the story originates with a survivor of early and not terribly pleasant (or effective) treatments regaling his mates later down at the tavern with his view: "Forsooth! They might as well have banged two rocks together - with my john thomas in between!"    The English traditionally blamed sexually transmitted diseases on the French. "The French disease" was a common name for syphilis, or occasionally other sexually transmitted infections.    The French in turn called syphilis the "Neapolitan disease". I'm not sure who the residents of Naples blamed it on.     The English got their comeuppance, though. When syphilis started appearing in the Pacific, the Tahitians called it the "British disease".    For the French, the term "la maladie anglaise" - the English disease - referred to sadomasochistic activities involving flagellation. Make of that what you will, but I suspect there was a specialised cross-channel sex tourism industry in historical times.    Plus ?a change.|`|Su0O55W8aa	The term is derived from Old French, "Clapoir", meaning sexual sore. Also, Drs would "clap" both sides of the penis as treatment.    Yes it is Gonorrhea!|`|OpkuaKiYaa	Gonorrhea is called the clap because back then in order to cure it are "professional" would take to rocks and slam your penis together in order to cure it.

95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	You don't "HAVE" to have it pulled. I still got mine and I'm planing to keep them.    Some 10 years ago a dentist tried to push me into pull them out but he was only interested in the money (I suspect) and I was like "Why to pull them out if there is nothing wrong with them???"|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	If you have insurance that will cover it get them pulled. There is usually barely any room for them and they are impossible to brush so they can get cavities really easily.  Just get them out you will be glad you did.|`|ZR8htpB5aa	You will only need to take them out if they are crooked/impacted/slanted.    If they are growing just like all your other teeth.. nice and straight, then you can leave them alone.. just make sure you brush them just as much as your other teeth. It can be kinda hard because they are back there in your mouth but just keep them clean and you should be good. :)|`|2fGHF3RQaa	No don't get them pulled unless they start bothering you.  I actually have a wisdom tooth that the dentist put a crown on.  You never know when they might come in handy.

yDJiiqcsaa	Trying to "figure it out" or "fix yourself" is like doing surgery on yourself - it doesn't work.  It's said that about 90% of what we are (personality) was made by the time we were 5 years old.  Most people don't even remember much before 4 years old. You need help with this - a skilled psychologist. And it won't be quick either - expect it to take years..... but if you succeed in 3 years you'll still be much better off than where you'll be if you spend the next 3 years trying to figure it out yourself.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	sounds like you are trying to live up to what you think others expectations are and you are failing to do that.    imo it is self esteem issues - some cognitive therapy/group therapy if it is the right group/therapist would be good.    if you have ever been emotionally or physcially abused it is important to address these issues - they destroy ones self worth.|`|nPwxVN1naa	I recommend seeing a counselor about this. And if you don't want to do that, at least talk to your general practitioner about prescribing you an anti-anxiety or anti-depressant.     But I recommend seeing a counselor/psychologist the most. You need to figure out why you're feeling this tremendous guilt in the first place. I wish you luck. And stay strong!|`|4c9c508939fd5ea8648f237d1f1a66c4aa	Unnecessary guilt is a symptom of depression. So you could have depression. See a doctor.
pTbGI4sZaa	Deoxygenated blood enters the heart through the right atrium.  It then passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.  From there it flows through the pulmonary artery (the only artery in the body to carry deoxygenated blood) to the lungs, where it is oxygenated.  The blood then goes back to the heart's left atrium, through the bicuspid valve to the left ventricle, and out to the body through the aorta.|`|nqDqTZKUaa	Its kind of amazing if you think about it, cuz.. blood is always flowing thru the body in a closed loop, you dont even know or see it but its flowing.
5Pf2az2saa	You don't need God to resolve your problems.   I think you finally need to let go of the feelings you have for this ex girlfriend of yours because with these feelings you will never truly be able to attract other girls. I mean how great could this girl be if she broke up with you and is now dating another guy? Not that great. You truly deserve better. And seeing how much you love this girl shows your capacity for other women out there who would truly appreciate you. Get over her. You deserve much better. All your problems could have arisen from the break up. So try your best to get over her. One way to go about it is to see how much she is missing out and not realizing how much you care about her. If she cannot do that, then she does not deserve your love. And as far as other girls go, the right one will come along. You just need to prioritize your day to day actions and goals. They always do come around. I hope i was a little bit of help. Wish you the best of luck. And be strong, screw her!  ciao|`|39x9tNJzaa	You need God and medicine.    I'm kidding.  Sort of.    Sounds like you've gotten yourself in a slump over this girl.  The only thing I can tell you is what you probably already know.  She has moved on, but you haven't, but you need to.  Stewing in your grief over losing her is self destructive and counter productive, not to mention it won't bring her back.  I don't know how to tell you to get over her and move on, because I've done the same thing, and I've been in the same position as you, and I know how much it sucks.    Time will help, and so will avoiding the places you know you're likely to run into her or see her. When you start thinking about her try to go do something else to take your mind off her.  Do you have any friends that will let you vent?  A shoulder to cry on?  If not, see a counselor a few times.  Sometimes just ranting and venting all that pent up emotion and frustration is all it takes.    You don't need medication.  You just need somebody to listen.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	You need God and medicine. And I'm not kidding.  Maybe you won't need medicine if God fixes you.   I'm sorry but God IS the answer to any question of the meaning/purpose of life.  If I thought that all there is is THIS life - let me load my gun.  But it's not. Only in the perspective of how God sees you and loves you will any person's life make sense.  Sorry but if you take those 2 (God/medicine) out of the equation (especially God) - you've got 5hit.  Sorry that's not what you want to hear but it's the best I have.
OcbO80Hoaa	its a hard road to recovery.  i know it is. im there right now.  you need to know that rescue is possible, and that freedom is possible.  if you have something, like a razor, that you always use, put a little note on it talking about how you dont wanna do this, how youre stronger and better then this.  also, try holding ice in your hand  try snapping an elactic band around your wrist every time you get an urge.  write down all your feelings then rip it up  call a friend, go for a wall, or somewhere public when you get the urge  try punching a pillow etc..    theres many more things that help- just try goggling it!    best of luck !|`|k4DxnbMCaa	Try to find a different way to release, such as poetry or cooking.|`|tqn64Pstaa	Put all the cutting instruments in a box, tape it all up and ship it off to sea.

And think about waht causes you to cut?|`|6TAsm1Bzaa	Forget all you've been told about communism and collective ownership. Your body does not belong to you, but to the collective.

When you are sad try to recognize what made you sad.  When your angry, what made you feel angry...etc.  Hopefully this will help you get in touch with your feelings and emotions.  Best Wishes to you.

I used to struggle with my weight and ate almost nothing all the time to lose it all.  Then I started weight training and built up some strength.  You can build strength without muscle growth, and it will burn more calories which means you can eat more, look good, and weigh less.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	That is a good weigh but you need to eat start eating fresh fruit and vegetable stay away from the fat and refine sugars and you should be good.Start weight lifting 3 pounds to define your muscles and swimming,if you do not eat you will mess up your metabolism and set your self up for diabetes your young and need food to stay healthy|`|qiIlZLs6aa	123 lbs at 5'4 is normal and healthy weight. I'm the same height and weigh 130 lbs.  Your calorie intake per day seems rather low though most people go for 1400-2000 calories per day so they can try to maintain a high or decent metabolism.  So don't feel guilty when you eat because you have to remember that your body stores fat when it doesn't get enough food,  so just make sure you are eating healthier and less fatty foods and you should be fine.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	If you don't believe your doctor, why should you believe us?

VBMOuIuxaa	umfortunately, popping a pimple by using your fingers and applying pressure can damage your skin and believe it or not, in some casescan cause scarring. therefore if you just have to get rid of it, i would suggest use a needle, safety pin, etc (sterilized first) and prick the tip of the head and GENTLY remove the exudate (the gunky stuff) then sterilize the "wound" and give it time to heal. no picking.|`|woxz5TrDaa	People always say popped pimples scar, and they really don't. If you can't see it I would have someone else pop it, with their finger nails, or even something like a needle or safety pin that has been rubbed down with rubbing alcohol or lemon juice.  :Lemon juice makes the pores smaller leaving you with less breakouts and black heads!!!!   And to reduce the redness, a frozen spoon on the effected area can fix that!|`|EPeWrtZVaa	OMG NEVER!!!! POP A ZIT!!!!! It WILL scar!! Get your pimple cleared naturally so you don't scar.

A lot of times the need to cough is suppressed while sleeping just like most body functions.  This will cause things that make you cough settle in the lungs during sleep, which is why people with allergies, asthma and smokers will wake up coughing or start to cough as soon as they sit up in the morning.  Usually watery burning eyes is a symptom of allergies, or perhaps sinus problems.|`|La49JNrAaa	Instead of asking Yahoo for help I think you would be better off at least calling the doctor's office and getting a check-up. it couldn't hurt.

8RiufGhVaa	It could be you're overtraining/exercising too much. If you do this you weaken your immune system making you susceptible to colds and other illnesses. Try to take a day off in between the days you exercise. If that's not possible, try going to bed earlier and get more rest. As always, make sure you are eating properly and getting enough nutrients.     Another possibility is allergies. If you are running outdoors you could encounter things you are allergic to (dander, pollen, dust, weeds, mold, etc.) These allergens can stick to your clothing and hair. If you don't shower after you run to get all of these things off of you it can cause the basic allergic symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat). You could see a doctor to get allergy testing or try taking Claritin or over the counter medicines that will help your symptoms. Depending on your allergies, any environment could cause problems. For example, I am allergic to mold, so if I run on a treadmill in the basement, I would have to make sure I took something for my allergies beforehand.     Good luck!|`|pMAqetBUaa	I think it's time to change your habit.  I think you smoke cigarette.  Before starting a run you better try to flex your  muscles first, like stretching exercises like  jumping jack, my toes my knees.|`|e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	People don't get sick from being cold or getting caught in the rain.  The real cause for colds during the change of seasons, and your exercising, is the drying out of the mucus in your nose and throat.  This increases the susceptibility to germs and you're more likely to catch a cold or other illness at that time.  Another issue might be where you run or exercise.  Is there anything you're allergic to?  Being exposed to this might be the problem.  Just having symptoms for 1 day is more like an allergy than a cold or other sickness which should last for several days.
l2qtG4yfaa	It happened to me today ( it was the first day of official practice for us), I think it has to do with being outside in the cold weather so long. I was sneezing a lot after practice today, because it was pretty cold.
mqXyDTwwaa	You can't. You didn't lose much fat while you were sick. Most of what you lost is water and intestinal bulk. As soon as you start eating on a regular basis again you'll regain what you lost. Sorry. Just keep in mind that numbers on a scale don't mean much. If you didn't lose any fat, then it doesn't matter if the scale says 128 lbs, or 120 lbs.|`|1nIeHzofaa	If your serious you must change your eating habits forever.  Diets are short term.  Only eat foods low in fat with almost no saturated fat.  Read every food label.  Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low fat protein (fish, soy, yogurt, and beans), and substitute olive oil for butter and mayo.  Do not eat any fried foods or fast food.  Don't cheat. That's where most people fail and why you don't see everyone at the gym having six pack abs.|`|AA12051696	portion control and exercise|`|FTeonR2laa	Without gaining it back ....you'll have to eat less than you did b4 you were sick  so say u ate 1500 calories b4 u were sick  eat about 900-1300 calories....  and excercise!    umm i was anorexic last year...and i ate only 600 calories....so trust me ur not anorexic......if ur say 5'4 than n e thing less than 105 lbs would make u anorexic....thats what my doctor told me!|`|gzLzzIZLaa	Actually, as others had said, you didn't lose any fat at all.    To prevent eating disorder, try to follow a certain balanced diet.    For example, drink more water, eat less carb, and adequate protein, do not forget about fruits and vegetable as well.    for fruits, I can recommend some berry like grape, acai berry and others.
FCWq1v6oaa	Aww, it sucks, I know. I have anger management issues and it's hard to deal with. I did a report on it, because I needed some ways to deal with anger and tame it. Now, I'm about the same age as you. At early ages is the best time to start doing something about it.  I really for feel you to.  Don't bottle up though!    First, I want you to think back to when all your anger started building up. Violence that takes place in your house can be stressful, and can build up anger. If anything happens that is dangerous, tell someone that can help, don't let it continue. Moving to a new school and getting bullied can make you angry to. Some signs are very irritable and crabby, tired and restless, excited and wired, paranoid, nervous, strong feeling toward minor problems, confused and concentrating becomes harder, doubting self ability, and smiling less the usual.     Here's how to help. Get a rubber band that fits around your wrist. When you feel urges to become violent, snap the rubber band. Snap it once or twice to snap you out of it and distract you. Another good way is get a journal! Write your feelings and also write letters that aren't the best things to say to people face to face. Walk away from the scene before you flip. Sit down, cool off, and come back to maturely deal with the situation. You can ten deep breathes from your gut, not your chest. It will calm you and help you deal better. Another one is yoga, yoga, yoga. It may not be for you, but if it is, do it. It helps you connect to your feelings and think things through.     I don't recommend anger management classes for your age. If it comes down to it, you may need to, but if those help, don't do it.     And if someone says that a girl punching a wall isn't excepted, they are crazy.  I am a girl along with you, and trust me, I have had times where I could just punch someone and feel SO much better.  It is tough having anger problems, but don't ever think that your family won't love you anymore.  Depression is hard and almost everyone goes through some sort of it.  Don't let it take you over, rise above it.    Also, boxing is absouletley amazing!  I loved it, and it really helps.  Martial Arts also, it's stress releiving.     Please, email me anytime for anything else. I have MANY more tips I can share with you. Take care|`|cF236fvTaa	Don't u kill your self or think about it you are so young and have a full life a head of you.  I know Ur going though a lot but i promise u, u can get through it.

You could try taking St. Johns Wort. It's a natural supplement that helps to balance certain chemicals in your brain and can help not only your anger, but your depression as well.|`|UsH20vSAaa	Hi,    I am sorry that you are struggling with depression from such an early age.  I have had major depression from about the same time.  I also have a friend that is bi-polar.  I have a question for you....  Do you only hit people that you feel are safe to hit?  For example someone you know may not or may not be able to stand up to you.  I hope that this is not the case because that just makes you a bully.  If you really can not control your anger then that makes it much more difficult to answer.  I would definitely talk to your therapist about this when you go.  The medications that you are taking can be adjusted or you could be switched to another that would help more.  Just don't give up because there is always hope.  I have suffered since about your age as I said and have just recently been put on a medication that is helping immensely.  Abilify.  At your age there are certain meds. that they will not put you on because they may cause more harm than good.  Just remember to keep your head up and keep up hope.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk.|`|39x9tNJzaa	Your parents aren't taking this seriously?  What the hell is wrong with them?  You'd be surprised how many seemingly well-adjusted girls feel and lash out the same way you do.  In this society, it's common for us to hide our mental illness because, as you said, it's unbecoming.    I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  I'm very, very familiar with anger and rage problems.  I've contemplated suicide on numerous occasions, nearly did several times, and have nearly been admitted into the hospital's psyche ward by my doctor.  And what's even more frustrating than being unable to regulate my moods and emotions like everybody else can is the fact that when I tell people what's wrong with me they tell me the same thing they tell you.  They laugh at me and tell me everybody feels that way, that I need to grow up, and that I have no reason to feel this way.    Counseling will help you a lot, and it will also help your parents understand just how serious bipolar behavior is, and how deeply it really does affect your life.  A therapist CAN help with your depression, and so can medication if it's necessary.  The lowest available dosage of Zoloft is so small and subtle, and yet made a world of difference for me.|`|fMLBPUVeaa	sounds tough. don't off yourself, that's not the way to go. no giving up by crossfade is a good song to get you through the really tough moments, i'll admit it can be kind of corny when all you want to do is give up, but if you're open to it it can help. i'll be thinking about you on wednesday, i hope it goes well, i've never heard of neuroscience. do you like your counselor?? or like them as much as you can, because i don't think you will get much out of it if you don't care for their personality.  parents can be tricky, just hang in there with them and don't let them get to you. friends can be just as tough, but if i were you i would try to tell them some so its not like you're prentending all the time. but only tell those who will at least have some empathy, don't hurt yourself more by telling those you know won't care too much. i hope you meet a good counselor or person to help you, someone who will listen and help you. i am a 14 year old girl, so if you ever want to talk to me sometime i can give you my email. i know you don't know me and i'm not the best with advice all the time, but i know what it's like to need to tell someone something right now, when it can't wait. so hang in there and i really do hope you feel better soon. just let me know if you want to talk.|`|mCS5Dy7paa	well, i have some of the same problems, but on a lesser scale. i find it easy to talk to my good friends, sometimes i tell people and they think im crazy, but they pretend not to believe me.. but i do have one good friend that i can trust and she doesn't have any bias and doesn't judge. My state of mind was worse when i was little. and i tried to end my life several times, but as i've gotten older i try to go through life in a day by day, simpler way. a am always mad, and i have a hard time expressing my anger. but now i take myself away from the situation as best as i can. sit down think about what matter most to me, like the love that i can experience as my life goes on, and if i let this feeling consume me then i cant get to experience all this good stuff that if u don't give up will happen.     i know that the hardest thing to do sometime is to leg go of the feeling of anger. but it is easier to if u can just take a step back from the situation and really consider wut u are doing. and u have to have a pretty good will power to be able to stop urself, and if u dont have everything under control now, u will be able to over time develop a better and better will power to resist ur anger.     i find that drawing, music, and going for walks (out in the fresh air, makes me feel less claustrophobic, in a way and less angry) i will ask my friends to go for a walk with me, or i will just step out side  and let out a little bit of steam, and if u feel really angry u can try to run, BUT do not do anything to hurt urself. i have experienced to many times were i have taken out my anger on myself in order to feel better.    but its not worth it. and hurting other ppl no matter how much u are mad at them doesn't help either.    u need to start to try to get ur emotions and actions under control as soo as u can cuz the older u get the harder it is.|`|YJtjPUDBaa	I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but I think you should find the reason your depressed all the time. Is it because of someone or an event? Once you do try to overcome your depression by talking to someone, maybe your parents or your best friend.  The good thing is that you admit that you have a problem. That's the first step to recovery.   Try to find a hobby or something that takes your mind off the depression.  However, above all else, DO NOT EVEN THINK OF COMMITTING SUICIDE. Your life is too valuable.     P.S. listen to your counselor and see a psychiatrist, they're there to help you  P.P.S. i hope you get better :)
AA10718475	avoid eating and activities 3-4hrs before your target sleep time, dirnk warm milk and avoid doing activities in your bed so your mind will be set that the bed is for sleeping only.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	Going to bed and getting up at the same time is definitely a good start.  You need to make sure your room is totally dark and totally quiet.  Lights and sounds catch the attention of your brain and distract it from falling asleep, and even when you do fall asleep it is hard to achieve REM sleep because your brain is still paying attention to the tv or radio.  Even if you do not sleep, it is important to lay down in a dark quiet room at a comfortable temperature from the time you would like to fall asleep to the time you would like to get up.  This will eventually train your body that this is the times you want it to sleep.  Also, even if you do not sleep during this time,  your muscles and brain have gotten some relaxation and you will not be as tired as if u were up pacing around and stressing over not sleeping.  Also if you are going to count sheep, make sure they are sleeping when you imagine them and not jumping over a fence.  Jumpy sheep will not help you sleep!|`|F3ActNtIaa	You have to get up and go to sleep at the same time everyday.

What that is you worked out and just hit a spot where you cant gain more weight.  Im guessing you probably havent been able to advance in weights your able to lift either.  I get these alot, alot of people do.  If you start to take Creatine, you will gain water weight, but it also makes you stronger too.  It takes two weeks to feel the full effects.  I started using supplements when I was 16.  Im 18 now and fine.  So I wouldnt worry about that.   I dont reccommend NO Xplode.  It has WAY to much caffine.  at least for my stomach at least.  I recommed  MuscleTech NaNO Vapor.  To me and others its better.  Creatine is a awesome supplement!  I love it!    look on bodybuilding.com for the least expensive supplements and best reviews.  its really the best site.  msg me if you have questions.

Those will really help you gain weight. Eating ice cream, peanut butter, breads, nuts, pastas, and bagels will help. Just eat more than you normally would, but not to the point where you feel sick. Weight gaining shakes will probably be the most effective; these include Ensure and Boost. You can drink these as many times a day as you want to. I've heard the "Boost smoothies" line tastes good. Try protein shakes, I know they work. Also, you could go to a health food store or a vitamin store and ask an employee for a weight gaining supplement. Eating eggs- boiled, fried, scrambled can also help you gain weight. If you are using fat free milk, switch to whole milk or 2%. Dairy is a great source for weight gain. Think: cheese, yogurt (not the low fat variety), whole milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, (nothing below 2%, try to find something higher.)    Here's some more info:  Tips for Increasing Calories While Keeping a Healthy Diet    * Add cheese, nuts and dressings made with olive, walnut or canola oil to salads.  * Eat starchy vegetables such as potatoes and corn more often.  * Go for dried fruits or fruit juices as healthy higher calorie snacks.  * Add cream or cheese sauces to fish and baked chicken breast.  * Choose herbs and spices to increase the flavors of your food rather than relying on salt.  * Add powdered milk to soups and sauces to offer calories and protein.  * Spread Peanut butter on whole grain bread, apples or celery sticks to get a great source of protein and calories.  * Stick with healthy desserts, such as a bowl of berries with whipped topping and lot of chopped nuts.  * Spoon healthy salad dressings on sandwiches and as a dip for vegetables.  * Dip whole grain bread into olive oil, walnut oil or flax seed oil. If you don't care for much meat, add legumes such as black beans, kidney beans and pinto beans as protein sources.  * Pick dark chocolate as a treat. Dark chocolate has antioxidants that other sweets don't have.|`|tfPT2zIlaa	i think u should talk to ur doctor.. but i heard that if u eat lots of pasta and potatoes u gain weight quickly :)|`|doftmlQWaa	believe me...

Your hospital must be as useless as my local hospital.    Go to the doctor. Immediately. And tell him what you are experiencing mentally.

You are also going to appreciate having smaller breasts when you are older - they will look firm a lot longer than bigger breasts do - especially if you always wear a bra to keep them supported.    You can do exercises to perk up your pectoral muscles which might help them appear a little bigger, but try to love your body the way it is.    Take it from a large breasted girl - big boobs come with back pain, make it impossible to find pretty bras that work, and make working out terribly difficult. It's not fun!|`|ps3GTuO2aa	Nope not at all  sowwy.|`|F2i2Ll7saa	Nope they don't make one sorry!|`|Msx6VKHSaa	i don't think there is a pill for that|`|VBMOuIuxaa	fraid not. surgery works though. i love MINE

doftmlQWaa	kind of...    just by being alive you burn (your weight in lbs) x 10 calories a day.  eg, if you weigh 110lbs, you will burn off 1100cals a day APPROX    there are ways to ork it put exactly but it takes a while    Add exercise ontop of that ie, walking and moving etc... you probably will burn that off anyway :)    good luck!! x|`|3tnistZQaa	Of course, no way around it.|`|IeOeYOJ3aa	Ugh no. That would be unhealthy.  There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat, you could try burning that but that would be even stupider. The way to lose fat would be by reducing the number of calories you intake from the number of  calories you should be eating in a day. Your body would then be forced to burn the fat stored in your body to get the energy you aren't eating in calories. And that's how you lose fat.|`|4Di2LRstaa	not really    many would say yes many no  try googling it|`|FTeonR2laa	yes you do have to burn more calories than you eat.....  if you burnt 1500 calories a day  and ate 1500 calories a day  than ur body would just eat the food....cuz there is no point to break into your energy stores....when theres supply from your food already
NSayh9jDaa	When I was in physical therapy for my shoulder, they did a technique call 'icing' and they said it will work for shin splints also. You just take an ice cube or frozen cup of water is what they used. You rub it up and down the area for  almost 1 minute, then take off and it should be numb. You then press on the area and massage it for 30 sec. Repeat this about 5 times.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Shin Splints are excruciatingly painful. They're caused by too much exercise & not enough stretching. It's basically when the muscle pushes the two bones apart. It would hurt whether you're sitting still or moving. The only thing you can do for it is massage out the cramps. Maybe your muscles are just sore.

nksewi03aa	Please do NOT listen to the poster who said to try them a bit and see if you have "toleration".  Something caused your GPC, and that something was likely:    -Dirty lenses  -Small scratches in the lenses that are not visible    Putting those lenses back in your eye is inviting trouble.  I know you hate your glasses, we all do, but the chances of you getting GPC all over again is probably 75% or greater if you reuse those same lenses.  I'm not saying I guarantee you WILL get GPC again, I'm saying the odds are not in your favor if it involves your original lenses.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	You can wear your contact for a short period first to see how you can tolerate them. Different people have different tolerations. Always clean and disinfect your lenses. Dirty lenses can hurt your eyes.
4cWtH7X2aa	Well I don't have all the info you're looking for, but I was at the dentist today and just scaling cost me $200.    If you don't have insurance hold on to your receipts as you can use them for a tax break. Anything over 3% of your total income you can claim.
f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	See a podiatrist, if possible.  I would look for one who has a focus on sports medicine.  I don't have "flat feet" but I do have very low arches.  I ended up tearing the tendon that supports my left arch.  After getting it repaired, I was fitted with custom orthotic arch supports, and given a lot of information on shoe types that were good for my type of feet.  I have been doing very well since then.  If you can't see a podiatrist, go to a store that specializes in running shoes and runners.  Most of the staff is pretty knowledgeable, and if you explain your problems, they can probably hook you up with a pair of shoes that will help.|`|xthjbUg2aa	CUT EM OFF AND GET PEG LEGS,      SO WHAT IM SAYING IS THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT....INCASE YOU DIDNT GET THAT MESSAGE...|`|uHDGzmeqaa	Get shoes or shoe inserts with high arcs in them so you foot forms to the arc|`|annOPoQJaa	oh my gosh, i have this EXACT same problem. i know how you feel, it sucks! what helped for me is getting what are called orthotics, they're arch inserts that you put inside your shoes that give you arch support. they make such a difference and your feet don't hurt nearly as bad. talk to your doctor or podiatrist about getting some made. or you can buy the kind at the store, dr. scholl's seems to work pretty well. good luck!|`|AFi5kTiEaa	If you plan on running long term, you should go to an orthapedist and get inserts fit to your foot.  they are expensive but worth it if you are in pain.  Insurance might cover some or all of the cost, not sure.|`|pqnEavSyaa	Flat feet (or low/fallen arches) can lead to over-pronation, a biomechanical imbalance that may cause serious problems over time.  When people who suffer from over-pronation stand or walk, the arches collapse with every step we take, and the ankles roll inwards.  Pronation itself is not wrong as we need to pronate and supinate as part of our gait. Pronation (rolling in) acts as a shock-absorbing process and supination (rolling out) helps to propel our feet forward.    Flat feet or fallen arches may lead to uncomfortable, and even painful conditions such as plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The most effective treatment solution for over-pronation is to wear an orthotic shoe insert.    For more information please refer to links below.
5E2ryPPIaa	Just remember to keep your hands away from your face.  Also, if your daughter is puking, definately try to keep your mouth closed because the vomit can go airborne in tiny vapor size particles.   In addition, if you flush vomit, close the lid first, as it can send the particles airborne.  Unfortunately, Lysol, does not kill the stomach flu as it is actually not influenza, but a stomach virus. You need bleach to kill it. Your daughter can be contagious for up to 3 days after the symptoms subside and for up to 2 weeks in the urine and feces.  I'm not sure how old she is, but if she is in diapers or toddler age needing help in the restroom, just be careful and wash your hands thoroughly for the next 2 weeks.  Good luck!

d6M0jmIkaa	Lena got some of her facts wrong.    Bipolar 1 is where you have both manic and major depressive episodes.  Bipolar 2 is where you have hypomanic and major depressive episodes.  There is also Cyclothymia which is a milder form of bipolar; with hypomanic and mild depressive episodes.  Finally Bipolar NOS where your doctor feels for some reason you are bipolar, but you do not fit any other category.    Now all this is quite confusing, so I added a link to a web-site that you should read over.    Based on your symptoms, it is unlikely that you are bipolar.  When you're bipolar you have EXTREME mood swings that usually last for weeks or months.  They don't usually change several times a day.    To Lena- Were you diagnosed by a Professional, because the symptoms you are describing don't sound like bipolar disorder.  I am not trying to judge you but it is important not to self-diagnose.  If that's what you did.  You don't seem to understand the disorder very well, be carefull what you are telling other people and make sure you know what you are talking about.    EDIT: Glad I could help, you should defenatly seek out help if you think this is an issue.  Try talking to a school counselor or asking your parents to take you to see a psychologist.|`|ps3GTuO2aa	Well im Bipolar,  and trust me it is not something you want to have.  You constantly are changing,  for ex: i myself are sometimes really happy at my friends and idk what happens to me but the second i opened my eyes again all i know is that im mad at them for no reason.  And being bipolar is you either are Bipolar1 or Bipolar2,  bipolar1 is depression, and bipolar2 is mania.    My story is I myself sometimes feel like Im on top of the world, and in other times I feel like theres no point of living, its crazy I sometimes I feel like I am no one, I then dont believe in god but I know damn well I do, I am bipolar1-2(mixd), + OCD, sometimes I feel like this whole world is fake and that this is all a joke, every day when I get home I feel isolated I feel like I can do better but something tells me that I cant, and that gets to the point where I am about to give up. This is torture. Misery. This world is chaos in my mind I feel like theres no point in living, but then theres the human way of life and you go back to the real world, where you dont belong. I am and fell like Im insane, this is not something to make fun of or joke, it is real life, its something that you cant control, ill usually try to hide my depression and emotions in school, I cant help it, ill usually cry when Im alone, I try to act like everything is control, I can pretty much say I am control freak, I want everything to be okay.    And i would tell you much much more of my story and how it feels but its crazy its stuff like that that i doent even know how to deal with it because im so stuck up with it that i hate it but i try to control and deal with my Bipolar Mental Illness.    Heres is a video that will help you understand Bipolar Disorder:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5VLtJeeE...    If you really think you are bipolar i suggest you to go to the Dr. and tell him why you think your bipolar and youre symptons and they will diagnose you.    Good luck, i hope your not Bipolar, trust me its hard its somethign you dont want.    Hoped i helped and got 10 points.    ps. if you need any help or have any questions email me.  :]    xoxoxo  Linan|`|QKfS9imUaa	You need to go to a psychiatrist and explain to him/her your symptoms. They will give you a diagnoses.

5L3KPgo8aa	You may have upset the balance of your gut enzymes with your recent diet. Some yogurt might be enough to get you back on track. There is also something called "Activia", I think, that might be made just for such circumstances.     Also, try not to eat fruit before piling on any meat or high protein stuff. It can cause similar effects that you are experiencing by fermenting in there.    PS: I like the little pun in there about the "back fire" wether it was intended or not. lol :)|`|58abdcb0652955a0d84a28b08b3cab8eaa	Get digestive enzyme pills from a health food store.

But brushing teeth...isn't fun.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	When your braces come off you are going to have white spots where the brackets are and your teeth will be a darker color around it, so it will be obvious to everyone around you that you don't brush, which is gross.  It shouldn't need to be fun.  You presumably are not a child.  Learning to manage your own personal hygiene is something you should have picked up when you were 10-11 and stuck to.    Try googling some pictures of rotted teeth.  My sister never brushed either and now her mouth smells like trash no matter how much she brushes, it hurts like hell, and it's too expensive for her to get them fixed.      EDIT    Yes, dear.  You are definitely old enough to brush your teeth.  You will certainly be old enough to be embarrassed when you get your braces off and you don't have a good smile, and your friends are certainly old enough to be offended by your breath stink.|`|oDaDcDZpaa	i ALWAYS time myself and the next time i will tire to be that or if that does not work mumble your favorite song
UsH20vSAaa	Hi,    I would suggest priding yourself in being different.  In high school I myself realized that I was much different than other people.  I found a great source of pride in this.  I didn't care about what others wore not only because I couldn't afford but because I didn't want to be like them.  I have often said to myself what would I have been up for (drugs for example) if I had been like everyone else.  You are who you are and that is something to be proud of.  Go to the store and don't look for what everyone else is wearing look for what you like.  You may just find that you are like everyone or that you are much different.  I am not goth or a prep but I wear what I like, do what I like, and am very hard to talk into things that I don't want to do.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk further.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	you suffer from what much of society suffers from.    you need to find and honor your own self worth.  recognize that it is shallow - which i think you already do.    society is structured in a why that calls out to people to conform to this or that.  when you completely understand that then you can develop your own self worth.    americans are in debt over the same issues you are struggling with - it is not unique.|`|SMCa68oTaa	make your own image. what do you really like? you dont have to be skater, punk, muscisian, emo, prep, to fit in. who are your real friends. they will except you as you are.

Try it out!|`|woxz5TrDaa	pore strips work but they can get expensive. If you boil water in a pot, stick your head over it for about 5 minutes, the steam opens up the pores which makes it easier to get it out. Rub a dry wash cloth over the place where black heads are and you should see them start to roll of some. The best thing to do after is rub lemon juice- real lemon juice from a bottle, on your entire face. It tightens the face and makes the pores smaller. Do it every night to every other night, not too much or you'll dry out your skin. I haven't seen a black head in months!!|`|VVF6DJVzaa	I have good skin so i dont get pimples as much. like 1-5 every month. and they usually go away after a month. I just wash my face in the morning and night and i take a hot shower at night so my skin gets all dry especially on my face. So when i look in the mirror after i wash my face like the skins so dry it looks like its peeling. Eventually my face oils itself up, and the dryness look is gone. After 2 weeks the pimples seem to peel off slowly, and then its gone.     Never pop just leave it alone. Thats the best, get your hair out of your face. Dont touch your face with your hands. Keep clean. And dryness is the point of acne treatments. To dry out the pimple. Thats how it gets rid of them.     Why do u think hardcore guys use toothpaste to get rid of their pimples. Cause it dries it out...|`|i4ceTwqLaa	Biore (Be-Or-Ay) works really well.    Just paste 'em on, wait, peel 'em off.

zLoyo24Taa	For and disorder it should be recommended that the parents go for genetic testing. This could help them with the decision of having more children. Some genetic disorders are just something that happens, such as trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome). The more information you can provide the parents with the better it is for them. I would let the mother know that genetics is really the only way to find out if this is a trait that is passed on by her or the babies father. Even if she has children with out this disorder they maybe carriers.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	www.trisomy18.org  its an organization and support group.  does the mother know at all,this baby may or may not even live till the age of 1yr?  she had 3 miscarriages,which likely means those babies were affected too?  genetic counselling is only needed if the person actually care to get tested or continue going back(surely she will get preg. again and again)  if she is religious,she may not believe in any type of planning or intervention.

They will administer tests to determine whether you really have asthma, prescribe treatment if you do, and if you don't will determine what it is that is wrong.|`|FOLjr8G9aa	oh my gosh I have had the same problem for about 6 months, but then I got it cured!!! hopfully we are talking about the same thing..  last year, around when the snow started to melt, I saw a TV show about people being sick from the snow mold. I got the idea in my head that I had that problem, and I started to huff and puff. then my mom said that she was allergic to those flufies in the air during summer, and one day we went for a walk, and I started to lose air. it was all in my mind, I thought, it might have been from the heat too. every time I breathed in, it felt like not enough air was getting in. then I might cough or get a pain. what I eventually did was forget about it. it goes away in winter, and I am scared it might come back. sometimes when I think about it it comes back. it was all in my brain. at one point I was just grumpy all the time, I didn't want to go anywhere. that might be your issue. but it might not. hope you feel better, maybe some tips from my past time will help you! =D    piper
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Yes, hemorrhoid pain can be painful and you shouldn't let yourself get constipated to allow this to happen.         Start by cleaning yourself gently with a warm washcloth and soapy water. A hemorrhoid is an enlarged blood vessel that has ruptured and bleeds sometimes hemorrhages.        Next sit in hot water for as long as you can it helps to shrink the hemorrhoids. Then apply Preparation H squirt some inside and make sure the area is covered. Stay off your feet for awhile, a few days if possible. Use the suppositories as much as you can especially at night. Change your diet to a soft food, stay away from spicy foods for awhile. Try oatmeal dry cereal things that will help you, not hinder. It will take about three or four days for total relief and keep a better diet. Try something like Metamucil for roughage.|`|Qk3oflwPaa	laxatives? id go n see a doc asap.|`|zWLlxZMeaa	Gross. Sounds like a personal problem.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*You had what we call a syncope episode. When this happens try laying down right where you are for a few minutes. Keep some OTC med creams for the hemorrhoids. They are generally caused from straining. I have been there. It is painful and I have had to lay down on the bathroom floor before. It passes-the fainting spells. Eat for fiber. This will help.
wd893RR8aa	yea it is osgood schlaughter or however you spell it... i had it from ages 13-17... pretty painful... i would have pretty sharp pain right beneath my patella (knee cap)  i wouldnt recommend taking pain killers because you can become addicted to them + the pain eventually disappears once you stop growing.  There is a small band that will contract the area to make the pain more manageable.  Just continue to take advil and stretch it a lot.  The good news is you tend to have a large growth spurt during that time period..  I went from 5' 4" to 6' 3" in 3 years.  I am almost 19 and I only have pain when it is hit directly.    Good luck man.  I know its hard to keep from moving in your desk because it can start to hurt.  Trying pulling your leg up close to you so that your thigh and shin are parallel.. It will relieve some pain.|`|AFIYLZzpaa	possibly osgood slaughter disease.    you don't have to play sports to get knee problems btw
B24W8w43aa	Toxins|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	If you've been ingesting ethyl alcohol for over 25 years, your body has adapted to it. It may be that as you detox your body chemistry (or your sense of smell) is changing to cope with the absence of alcohol. One of the byproducts may be smell. (I'm presuming that you bathe regularly.)  Some people even have smell hallucinations that can last for a few hours or up to weeks at a time.     You might want to check with a detox expert to see if they've ever heard of such a thing. Hopefully it's a good thing, even if you're smelly for a while.
ebQJsYTxaa	After over a year of research before my children were born, I decided to not vaccinate them at all.  They are 5 years and 20 months, and are extremely healthy--a lot healthier than other kids who have been vaccinated. They both had chickenpox, and one had pertussis (whooping cough), and not once did I wish I had vaccinated them.    Click here to see what can happen to a baby after the hepatitis B vaccine. http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/manag...    Kids can go to school and daycare without vaccines.  Here is the waiver information. http://mothering.com/discussions/showthr...|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	try looking at this from todays news  http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/02/0...|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	What vaccination.  Please be more detailed|`|HKaMsKltaa	have a doc do it and ask a doc not the internet!!!!|`|0jDuZRGfaa	IT IS NOT DANGEROUS!!!!!! if you do not get your baby vaccinated, it puts it at over a 60% more risk then a baby with vaccines. plz, for the sake of ur baby, get them vaccinated. i know they scream and cry when they get them, but, trust me... get them the shots.........|`|lrzv2a5naa	they have to get vaccinated eventually just let your doctor handle it|`|ot8tImmcaa	Then don't do it|`|LbGRsCTKaa	No, let your doctor do it.|`|XJkDHDNMaa	what vaccine?      and just think... is the vaccination more dangerous than actually getting the disease?  what would you prefer?|`|XXNaz4qTaa	Your baby should get all the shots that doctors recommend to you. They need them so that they dont get disease and DIE!|`|Mj1IoGblaa	Yeah...I heard that some combo vaccine is like autism shot. Kids became autistic after the shot.     I would suggest you not to accept combo vaccine. Take one at a time. Don't get too many different shots in a short time.    I don't remember I had combo shots when I was a kid, we never had disease outbreak or anything in school. I only had a few.    Be choosy what kind of shots you accept.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Yes, Yes, Yes.  Get the baby vaccinated.   I know the information looks frightening.  It scared me silly too, when I had my first baby- and I'm a nurse.  A lot of what you see out there is overblown, to be honest with you.  The diseases the vaccinations will protect your child against are far more deadly than the vaccinations are.  I'm old enough to remember when kids still got measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio, whooping cough and all those wonderful diseases.  I had a classmate in second grade end up deaf due to measles, and a classmate in fourth grade wearing braces because of the after effects of polio.  It's far more dangerous not to immunize, in my opinion.  I had measles- both kinds.  It was not a pleasant experience, trust me.  It cost my mother more than a week of sleep and worry, no doubt put a lot of grey in her hair.  They are not just simple, easy childhood miseries.  Even chicken pox is no walk in the park sometimes.  If it doesn't leave nasty scars, it can still lead to encephalitis-a brain swelling that can leave the child brain damaged forever.  Worse yet, dead.  So please, have your baby immunized.  It is the kindest and best protection you can give, and will last long after your baby is all grown up.|`|HAKQ1BMSaa	It is very important to vaccinate your child. You can check on the Center for Disease Control website. They will give you a vaccination schedule to follow for your child.    Although there are many websites that claim autism is caused by vaccines, there is no data to prove that. It was thought that a specific preservative might have been causing autism, but that preservative was taken out of childhood vaccines years ago.    Also, as others have said, getting the diseases would be far worse than any risks that might accompany a vaccine. The benefits from child vaccinations outweigh the risks!

They will also have a social worker from the hospital talk to you about either making a payment plan or help you apply for assistance.  I was hospitalized for four days without insurance and the hospital did all the paperwork for my medical assistance for me with the exception of a few personal details that I needed to provide for them.  if the bill is large enough your income will not be that much of a factor!

ZVDboZkPaa	My fiancee has Crohn's Disease.    Get yourself round to your local hospital now.    Crohn's Disease can kill you, if you just sit around and let it, or you could end up with your bowel and rectum being removed and having an illeostomy (a bag for your faecal waste), which is what happened to N because her local doctor and hospital did not diagnose the disease in time.|`|hOSDysG3aa	It sounds like it would be a good idea to go and see your GP at your earliest convenience.|`|I7sS4w0maa	I am in the Medical Field     Do NOT wait go to your doctor or the ER
AeeX1Wnkaa	Yeah, good luck with that. Depo did the same thing to me, and it was the biggest mistake of my life getting that shot. That's the bad thing about it...it stays in your body for 3 months, right? So whatever effects it is having on you, you can't do anything about it until the 3 months are up. You just have to deal with it...unlike the pill, which you can just stop taking and the effects are gone immediately. I bled non-stop for the longest time, then the bleeding would go away and come back without any warning like a week later. It made me so sick too...horrible nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps. That would come and go also, and last for weeks. I ended up having panic attacks because I never knew when I would be feeling good or be feeling so bad I was debilitated. That was from one shot. From my personal experience and from what I've heard from several OB/GYNs, switch to a different birth control.
AA12400635	You need to go to the doctor's as often urinary tract infections can actually lead to or really be a kidney infection and you need antibiotics to cure either.    In the meantime drink lots of acidic liquids like cranberry juice and pee whenever you feel the urge or can (as the bacteria quickly multiples and not going only aggravates that, while going can help to flush out some of the bacteria so it doesn't feel as bad until you can get the antibiotics to cure it). There are several over the counter medicines you can take for the symptoms (burning, frequent urge to make when you can't etc) but they will not CURE the infection only mask the symptoms. So it is important to see a Doctor and get it taken care of.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	go to the doctor and get some penicillin|`|ahsgk6bXaa	You probably need to get some antibiotics from the doctor.|`|ot8tImmcaa	I think you should go to the doctor|`|XEbDgBBUaa	Well, you really need to see a doctor and get antibiotic, but you can start treatment at home by drinking cranberry juice or taking a cranberry supplement like Azo.|`|Op37pHd3aa	antibiotics, which only a dr will prescribe.    meanwhile get some azo (at drugstores) and drink lots of fluids (cranberry juice recommeneded)|`|R7XwbLPOaa	if it is an infection on your own without a dr you can drink cranberry or blueberry juice and lots of water and flush it out
KOYC3XkJaa	There's a good number of scar reducers: mederma, bio-oil, prefer-on, vitamin E capsules. The only thing that removes scars is laser scar removal (very expensive). All the products I listed help to fade scars. Depending on if you have raised, flat, or indented scars, the effect will vary. Scar reducers will fade the redness from all 3 types, and some will help to flatten out raised scars, but none of them can raise indented scars.   There's also a theory that the product doesn't matter, it's the act of massaging the scar tissue that creates results, so massaging the scars with moisturizer should theoretically work as well as using the more pricey bio-oil.|`|F17bGTAOaa	Pants

dZLku4jaaa	for your friend. sometimes i have the same problem but its okay.  just tell after she goes to the bathroom, to not just wipe the outside but to kinda wipe in side of the lips of your vagina. im serious that's part of some reason of the smell.  also to shave all of the pubs because the odor from the private dwells on the hair so it will make the smell even worse.|`|u4FUeppNaa	she should get checked out by her GYN because there could  be a medical reason for her problem.

I highly recommend she go to a doctor.|`|fa168ead7a3b2811d62c6f6c92ed03c7aa	This is a hard problem to deal with, since you shouldn't be using deodorants inside the vagina, where the orour comes from, perfume may be the best option.    However, any strong odours from that area can be an indication of a bigger problem (like an infection of some kind) so your friend should see a doctor about it. It my be easy to fix for good.    Until then, use gentle perfumes, and tell your friend to make sure she's wearing natural fibre underwear (cotton, ideally,) since materials lie plolyester don't breathe, and could make the problem much worse.|`|VjFCNozjaa	It is most likely due to a bacterial infection and she should go to a Gynecologist for a simply cream she can insert to fix it. Untreated this could lead to fertility problems and pain so the needs to get it checked out.    She can also try using a gentle unscented soap down there (and nothing inside as this throws off the good bacteria that can get rid of the scent). She needs to be wearing cotton underwear (no silky or slinky fabrics) and not wear any underwear or tight pants at night.    She also need to make sure she is eating plenty of healthy food so her body can stay balanced (the ph levels).    The bottom line is she needs to talk to her doctor about it now - this could be something serious.|`|dALX1qQdaa	summer's eve products:  http://www.summerseve.com/ProductMain.as...|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Find out about a deoderant that won't cause a rash to the skin there.

edFyHFRhaa	You're probably feeling it more in the bend of your arm just because it may be slightly weaker there. As long as you are doing the exercise correctly it will work the correct muscle. Make sure your back is straight and that you do not use your back at all or sway when doing this exercise. It helps to stand with your back flat against the wall to prevent unnecessary use of your back. Your elbow must sit at your waist and not move from that spot. Do not raise your elbow at all, keep it snug against your waist and bend only at the inside crease of your elbow.    It sometimes helps to gently twist your arm... so when you start the exercise, the dumbell should be vertical to the floor as if you are holding onto a pole. Slowly raise your arm and as you do, curl your little fingers toward the inside of the lift. You should end holding the dumbell (palm up but still gripping the weight of course) with it horizontal to the floor.    It also helps to think about a muscle too when you want to work it. The act of thinking about that specific muscle focuses your attention and energy to that area.|`|Q5eUUbB4aa	You must be just starting out correct?

AA11522944	Five Stages of Puberty - Boys    1.   Normal Age Range: 9-12, Average: about 10   Male hormones are becoming active, but there are hardly, if any, outside signs of development. Testicles are maturing, and some boys start a period of rapid growth late in this stage.    2.  Normal Age Range: 9-15, Average: 12-13   Testicles and scrotum begin to enlarge, but penis size doesn't increase much. Very little, if any, pubic hair at the base of the penis. Increase in height and change in body shape.    3. Normal Age Range: 11-16, Average: 13-14   Penis starts to grow in length, but not much in width. Testicles and scrotum still growing. Pubic hair starts to get darker and coarser and is spreading towards the legs. Height growth continues and body/face shape look more adult. Voice begins to deepen (and crack). Some hair around the anus grows.    4. Normal Age Range: 11-17, Average: 14-15   Penis width increases, as well as length. Testicles and scrotum still growing. Pubic hair begins to take adult texture, although covers a smaller area. Most boys have first ejaculations. Underarm hair develops. Facial hair increases on chin and upper lip. Voice gets deeper and skin gets more oily.    5. Normal Age Range: 14-18, Average: around 16   Nearing full adult height and physique. Pubic hair and genitals have adult appearance. Facial hair grows more completely and shaving may begin now or soon.    During the late teens and early twenties, some men grow a bit more and develop more body hair, especially chest hair.

No caffeine, tea, coke, alcohol or energy drinks. Nothing with much sugar. ( it will suck for th first couple of days but you should be ok after.)

Mine rarely shoots more than a few inches, and quite often just dribbles out.  Don't compare yourself with guys in porn - that's entertainment, not sex ed.

IVq6eX9Naa	Ok if you have acute appendicitis You would have symptoms like a sudden onset of pain in your abdomen. The pain should get worse over a matter of hours, and eventually settle below and to the right of your belly button. No other part of your stomach should hurt. Also the pain should dramatically increase if you move at all.   If your doctor was truly concerned they should have checked for rebound tenderness, basically meaning that when the area is pressed, intense pain is felt when the pressure is relieved. They should have also taken a white blood cell count and a ct scan because these typically pick up beginning appendicitis.   If the pain gets any worse go to the hospital. Appendicitis is classified as a medical emergency and the appendix can burst and kill you. If your doctor thought you had an onset of appendicitis you should currently be being monitored and possibly prepped for surgery.    Appendicitis is a fast moving, deadly condition that is classified as a medical emergency. Go to the ER. its better safe then sorry
jJAENrvUaa	well they definitely put me to sleep!  so i don't even remember the procedure.  I wasn't very scared--i was excited because i'd never been under before hehhee...    first they gave me gas and it felt like i was swimming around in my body.  then they gave me anesthetic (an injection thing) and it just felt like a tiny sharp pinch--it was just annoying it didn't hurt.    and soon after--nothing!    and then i woke up with gauze in my mouth and i wobbled out to the car and my parents took me home.   and i slept for a while.  and i slept some more.    You have ice packets that you have to hold on your head (i think my mom and i devised some very embarrassing holder out of a bra or something.)  but you should get something to hold them on your cheeks.  it gets cold and annoying but soon after you take them off you'll want them back on again hehe.    you get pain meds and stuff.  i think i had percocet or something.    anyway it bleeds for a few days and you have to change the gauze out a lot.  blah blah.  and you'll be swollen.  you might get food stuck in there (they gave me this awesome squirter to get things out!)    only thing bad that can happen is if you get a dry socket (i think that's what i had) anyway after a while mine still hurt kinda bad and so the doctor put this really grody (TOTALLY DISGUSTING) green medicine in the holes and put a little knot of string in there after it.  and it kind of heals in a little dip in your mouth.  I think I swallowed one of the strings.  but oh well.    it doesn't hurt too bad and if it does you have ice and medicine so don't worry!|`|8Kwwgtvlaa	Well for me I was awake the whole time so if you are afraid being asleep will be a good thing....but I had no problems what so ever,I was a little sore after the medication wore off but I took my pain killers and was fine and was able to return to work after a day or so. I was nervous at first but got over it.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	Don't listen to those stories. You'll be fine! I was just like you, worried when I had mine out and was a bit scared b/c I didn't know what to expect. My doctors gave me laughing gas that made me seem like I was in a dream. I didn't even realize it either! I didn't feel a thing when they pulled it out! Funny thing is it seemed like the entire procedure was only 5 min when it actually took an hour. Afterwards my gums were sore a lot and were bleeding so I had to stick in gauzes in them for recovery. Couldn't eat any solids for a few days. A few days later I recovered fully and was back to normal :).  Hope that assured you, and I'm pretty sure it'll be the same with you. You won't feel any extreme pain during the procedure, not even an ounce of pain. You'll be just sore in your gums after the procedure is done and will have to avoid solids for a few days. It may seem scary, but actually it's not. Good luck and hope all goes well!|`|sMr8mUNvaa	it is not that scary. it doesn't hurt during it. but it is sore afterwords. it bleeds a lot and feels puffy but it is not that bad. don't worry and good luck!!
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING!Girl Sunshine, Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|f2c55a9e4bbb2062727f493dea7106f7aa	Im trying it now for the first time.  Ive been taking one of the free trials for about 2-3 weeks now.  Its seems to have trimmed me up a little but honestly i think most of that is because i drink water when i take it.  I usually dont drink water.  The first 2 weeks I thought it was doing something and I wasnt craving food as much but i think alot of that was mental.  Seems like this past week im going back to where I was and its not really doing anything.  Maybe its because im pms'in too...dunno.    Its definitely not all that i dont think.|`|kFECmFGLaa	I tried it for a couple months. I had been on a diet and exercising for 2 months before I tried it and wanted a boost and I didn't get any better results than before. I don't know if it was because I didn't take it long enough for it to work but I didn't see anything special from it. Hope I helped : )|`|Gx1CbI56aa	I've been using acai berry products for a couple of months now and I've noticed that yes they do work. I used them when I wanted to trim off about 15lbs.    I knew that diet and exercise alone would help achieve that goal alone but I needed something to help me with my mid afternoon snacking urges. This is where I found the acai berry really helped me.    It helped to curb those mid afternoon urges which meant when I went out jogging later that night I wasn't just jogging to work off that bag of Doritios I snacked on around 3pm instead I was actually working off the weight I wanted..    After a couple months I now no longer needed the supplements and can manage my weight more easily, so I found that yes they really did help speed up my weight loss goals when I used them along with a diet and exercise program, as the berries gave me more energy and helped to curb my appetite|`|tRSNM7FBaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out a few different trials and seeing the results.The site is pretty good at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.
Z0SiMz7daa	I would recommend seeking professional help.  Vomiting blood can have many causes.  Often times the pressure of continual vomiting can cause tears in the esophagus and ou will have bleeding from this.

mtoieaTsaa	Come on, you have to start taking care of yourself! Not for your parents' sake, but for your own. You have the power to change your own life. Start eating right, max 2 servings junk for per day. 5 servings of fruits/vegetables. Fixing your diet will eliminate the problem.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Yeah, we got one of those giveaway low-flush-volume water saver toilets a few years back, and the darn thing clogs up almost every day.    It's poor design.  You'd have to get a new toilet that works better.|`|hoDin3UYaa	You are most likely having the same issue that I had. I would simply hold it in for a week, and choose which day I wanted to go. This is not healthy at all, and I do not do it now and neither should you. As for your parents, I recommend that you try to resolve any issues you have with them.|`|WvAwQmndaa	you should try to use the bathroom more. Instead of going 1-2 times a week. Try to go  2 at least once a day. If you cant make yourself go, there are stool softeners that are different from laxatives. They make it easy for your body to go naturally.     yeah my parents were like that too. I had to take care of myself. If i didn't have things i needed i had to steal them from the store. Isnt that horrible, that a child has to fend for themselves?|`|NfQyNoUMaa	alright...this is gonna sound wierd but.. go take a  2 during ur least favorite class lol but someone else said try to resolve problems with ur parents....that is a very very VERY good idea!!

4B9Ve1LSaa	Yes, I think it is natural to have thoughts like these especially when you are doing something new and in uncertain territory.  In addition it would be natural for you to want your uncle's approval.  I think all young people really seek the approval of their family members, especially someone they look up to.  Court cases get pushed back all of the time.  Is there anything else you can do in the meantime with your uncle just to get yourself some additional experience?  He would probably be a great role model for you if law is what you are studying.  I am certain that he is very flattered that you would want to follow in his footsteps or have sought him out for this in the first place.  If you have done things in the past that may warrant these feelings of inadequacy, they were in the past - leave them there.  If you are having these thoughts with no real basis behind them then it sounds like you may need to work on your self-esteem, and/or you are experiencing anxiety about the new situation.  Good Luck to you.|`|SG27rfSdaa	yeah   I have paranoid thoughts like that alot.  best thing to do is:    check it out-ask him, talk to him and find out the truth    also once you know the truth, discard those thoughts as you know it's not true. Most likely it's paranoia. You'd have to give great detail and background info to prove this is true.  Sometimes things like that are true but rarely and you prob wouldn't know if it was ...so i think you're paranoid
CkznezXqaa	You dont want to go down that road. I used to hurt myself a lot.  I had to go to a hospital in TX (i live in MI) over the summer to get help.  There is a blog that might interest you,  if you go to selfinjury.com/blog ,you can creat an account and ask questions pretty much like this, but it is only about SI (self-injury)  i know you dont want to go to a doctor, but if this progresses you might need to.  Self-injury is not an addiction, but it acts like an addiction because it releases endorphines in your brain.  But so does chocolate and exercising.  You need to find alternatives.  I am doing much better after getting help.  I am still in therapy, but havent hurt myself in al long time.  Good luck.|`|179df6fff2a9ef0c050663f9e3ffa400aa	please don't take this the wrong way but you might be a masochist , which is a person who gets pleasure from pain  you should find something else that you enjoy or something that distracts you from your thoughts like a puzzle maybe?|`|Ajan02PCaa	I do this kind of stuff too. I don't think it's a huge deal, just don't accidentally kill yourself. If you're that concerned about it, see a therapist.|`|631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	I have been a cutter for three years now; a self-injurer for almost my entire life...    Therapists have never helped me.  I am not discouraging you from trying therapy, because it works for some people (it REALLY does, you just have to find the right one); but ultimately YOU are the only person who can control this.  You have to understand why you feel this way, what triggers it, and what can help you overcome those feelings.      I'd also advise you to try to avoiding cutting, if you can.  I have found it to be one of the most addictive, destructive things I've ever been involved with.  And, despite the physical dangers that most people worry about, the toll it's going to take on your mind and spirit is far worse.  You are going to be ASHAMED, EMBARRASSED, and feel even more alienated from other people than you probably already do.    Even if you don't ever go to a doctor, I strongly suggest you find a way to vent your feelings to other people, and TALK about this...even if it's completely anonymous.      I wish you all the best of luck, and I really do understand how this feels.
30fb04bf6fbd80bbf0bfa6fbeca2ace3aa	if you cant eat anything really in the morning, i would suggest to drink v8 fusion. it is a full serving of fruits and vegetables and it appears very healthy in the ingreidents. also, to get fruits in, when you crave a sweet, you should grab an apple instead of a candy bar.|`|TBEM9Ne1aa	HEY     IT IS VERY HARD WHEN YOU ARE IN CLASS BUT WHAT I DID IS TAKE DICED APPLE AND EAT ONE AT THE END OF A CLASS OR TWO|`|KcvinDvgaa	smoothies in the morning are amazing :)  Feel free to mix fruits and veggies together to get that extra energy boost most people need in the morning.

AA10725882	How can we trust that you are not going to say anything to him - - when your name is "I will not be silenced" ?  LOL  Just kidding of course.    Shadows or "spots" within the lung parenchyma on CT scans may also be scars from old infections.  Too early to tell here.  More testing is needed.
1hciyvKdaa	Pleas  hun settle down ok. Im sorry mom is gone from your life, I really am, and I am sorry your scared and dads not taking you serious. please continue to read my post please ok. To find the er phone number, you go to google then maps, put in your home address, then the box that says search nearby, try putting in hospital and see if one looks near you and call and see what I said below first though ok.         When you are at a critical life threatening stage it is apparent to anyone around you, that you are this ill. It is very common to be scaerd, see someting and feel its happening to you. This is flu season, and the flu can turn ugly and also be life threatening to you also ok. So drink plenty of water, ask for gatoraide, for a few of your drinks during the day, take tylenol and rest all that you can. You are dehydrated, thats what is causing the heart beat problem, yes you can drink a cup of water ever few hours and still be dehydrated, drink more try 6 ounces every single hour.  There is no more that you can do. You can call the ER to make yourself feel better, and ask to talk to a nurse regarding your flu symptoms and if they feel you should come in, they do have set criteria and guidlines to help access over the phone, if they are not too too busy. I hope you feel better. They are doing over kill on the recalls to be totally certain, every jar does not have samonella, only the potential. Wed have a million dead or in the hospital by now, if every jar had it ok. I hope you feel better, get that fever down!!|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Ooh used to work in Health dept. and would advice you to seek medical assistance immediately if only to put you mind at rest.  Your doc should be aware of the recall in your area.  So tell him of your fears.   Easy to read details of all symptoms on salmonella are on following website..But do see doctor as soon as poss. If Dad wont take you to doctor can you contact another relative and tell them of your situation..or get to the doctor  yourself. Good luck and hope you will feel better soon.  http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice...|`|RVicFEyFaa	Having lived in N.Y.C for at least 15 years & eating out alot, i've had salmonella a dozen times & the other food poisonings too lol. A few initial symptoms are extreme gastric distress, (extended stomach, hard belly that you could bounce a quarter off of & the urge to vomit, though you can't at first). It's awful & once what you've eaten is fully digested, you don't know which end to put on the toilet first. The only thing that really helps is bed rest & making sure you replace the fluids your losing, even if you keep losing them. Though this outbreak doesn't say if it's the elderly & very young ( babies & toddlers ) as well as those w/compromised immune systems that are the fatalities( most usually they are), there really isn't much more you can do. A hospital would put you on i.v fluids & a pain killer ( the DR. would not & would send you to the ER ). I've had friends admit themselves to the emergency room that were given a morphine drip in the worst cases of pain. Since you do have diarrhea, but no vomiting or sever stomach cramping....get yourself bu cu Gatorade or some other alternative for electrolytes, a banana & maybe some TheraFlu. I think you'll know in 24 hours if this is peanut related & your Dad will too. Feel better soon!!!!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Sounds like flu.|`|8te6mUHIaa	maybe tell your mom or maybe go to the doctor yourself .|`|4WjB4tHjaa	Maybe just the flu    ur fineit really depends on what type of peanut butter you ate|`|MyV9qm99aa	GO to the doctor obviously, because their is no way you can present on here or you don't have enough details.     GOD BLESS|`|HbmHRiwLaa	I accidentally ate some raw chicken wings and got really really sick with those exact symptoms.. i swore i had salmonella.. but it turned out to be food posioning.  the difference is the longevity in the illness.  salmonella can last for months.. food poisoning will only be a day to a few days.  just rest and drink plenty of water, because of the diarrhea.    hope you feel better!|`|RpoptQHDaa	Have your under arms turned black and the snot from your nose look like bricks?|`|79b8592899aa3dcb578c630cb4ebe264aa	Things are going around everyones freaked out over this recall.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Don't worry. If you had salmonella, you'd be puking. Just wait, drink some meds. If your dad won't get it for you, sneak out and buy over the counter immodium and fever reducers. DON"T WORRY! DON"T LISTEN TO ALL THOSE LOseRs!!! Just relax, don't worry. Abnormal heartbeat might just be in your head. Just relax. You might develop an eating problem because of your stress. I did once. I thought I was sick, I stopped eating, and I have been losing weight.     Try to remember what peanut butter you ate. Look on the label and see if it says it was manufactured by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) at its Blakely, Georgia processing plant. Or the Peter Pan peanut butter and certain Great Value brand peanut butter. Once you find this, ask your dad again. If he refuses, you have the right to  call the cops to have him arrested.|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	go to the dr. u should go anyway just to be sure|`|CYaNuxuDaa	Your K dont worry|`|gfCeJArVaa	well even if you dont have salmonella its STILL bad to a have a major headache.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	After looking over your question for the past 3 days, I have been trying to come up with the perfect answer for you and I just can't find one.  I am so sorry that this happened to you, but, unfortunately, it happens to someone like you, like me, every single day in this country.      Just last Friday, I was treated somewhat similarly by a pain management specialist.  By the time I left I felt completely demoralized, ashamed and exhausted.  Because I am simply looking for any way to end pain, I end up looking like a junkie.  I, too, would rather a holistic approach of yoga, acupuncture, and aquatic therapy.  Sometimes, it is the narcotics that have to do the job.    When pill popping became extremely popular to use and abuse back in the late 1980s and throughout the 90s, doctors started to pay more attention.  Now, doctors are in a full blown panic over their licenses, etc, in fear of prescibing to people that are faking just to get the high and they (doctors) are unable to determine the real pain from the fake.  Now, no one wants to prescribe even to the worst patients.  So, it does not surprise me that your PA treated you horribly.    When I thought one of my doctor's offices was calling CVS, I had to fill a prescription that evening anyway, so I asked if "X" doctors office had been calling them regarding my medications.  They said, "yes."  I was so upset.  It is quite possible that this guy did call the pharmacy.    I do believe that the insurance companies can disclose this information as well.      And this guy went out of his way to make you more miserable b/c he can.  He is more concerned about his license than your health.  He knows that you are in pain, which causes the chemical release of depression, which makes you unable to fully take a stand for yourself.  He knows that the worst you can do is file a complaint, and he will win b/c you are merely a "drug seeker."    Yup, there is something definitely wrong with this picture!!    I want to tell you that there are so many people that deal with health situations like yours and the shove off from the doctors office, too.  Please come to Yahoo Back Chat Room 1 in the mid to late evenings.  There is a wonderful support group there of people with chronic neck and back pain.  People that have had surgeries, or not, people that have pinched nerves, people that take pain meds, and people that do a more holistic approach, people from all over the world and people from your home state.  I hope to see you there sometime.    And if I never see you again, please know you are not alone here.  This happens all the time.  Take a stand for yourself the best way you can and find a good orthopedist in your area.  Find a good pain management doctor in your area.  There are excellent procedures for treating pinched nerves these days.    Best of luck & take care!!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	I can understand the nurse pract wanting to make sure you were not just looking for pills but mhe was unprofessional and way out of line! for 1 thing pain is subjective and if you say it hurts who is he to discount you? I would defiantly file a complaint somewhere and do not bother with that office anymore. Im embarrassed that someone in the medical field would treat someone this way.Also maybe you should see a Specialist also if they cant help physical therapy works wonders and a good pain dr. is also helpful. good luck hope you get feeling better|`|QvSwo3X9aa	The nurse practitioner was in his right to check everything before giving out narcotics. Too many good practitioners get in trouble with the authorities because of drug seekers. Its a shame that legitimate patients have to suffer because of this but if all the doctors are sent to prison then who would treat the patients?|`|OfQwVhD2aa	Go to your primary doctor & contact an attorney.
QC7UHPKXaa	The protein shakes do help you gain muscle but only if you work out taking it.If you don't work out taking it it will only make you gain weight.And be careful taking protein shakes too much some times taking too much can harmful.Make sure your only using what it says on the bottle.|`|1KHfd3F9aa	well first of all normally protein shakes are used for loosing weight soo i dont hy you would do that, but i also don't know much about that kind of stuff. if you want to gain muscle just do 20 push-ups, 40 sit-ups, and 20 "back ups" (there basically when you lay on your back and lift your butt up well keeping your shoulders pinned to the floor) do this every night and in about 2 weeks you will defiantly see results. i did this for like a year to burn fat but all it did was give me muscle witch just made me look bigger lol. but if ur really just concerned about gaining weight more so then muscle just don't do anything and eat a bunch. also people are all different metabolisms i have a lot of friends that want to gain weight but they cant because their metabolism is too fast, and its really hard to slow it down when your born with it. one of my friends is really skinny and kind of short. she's been eating McDonald's 4 times a week since she was 10 (shes 14 now) shes starting to gain weight but probably just cuz she growing older lol sry m answers so long hope i helped
B4hLK0W5aa	I was addicted to soda too, Mountain Dew and Coke to be exact.  It was killing me. I've stopped drinking regular soda and I'm now only drinking Koolaid (sugar free), water, juices, and Diet Sunkist and Sprite Zero (both taste exactly like to original, so not a bad deal really).  I can drink Diet Cherry Coke or my Coke fix, regular Diet Coke tastes like washer fluid.  When I'm out to dinner or have a drink of soda at my desk I Always have a glass of ice water too and I don't let myself get another soda until I finish my water too.  It's been working great for me!  I've lost about 30 pounds just with cut in sugar in my diet.    I had migraines for a while because I tried to go cold turkey.  So that lasted about a week until I was back to my 6 cans of Mountain Dew a day. What I did is I cut my intake in half for a week at a time.  So, first week I had 4 cans of the normal stuff and tried to have more water; next week I had 2 cans of my normal stuff, even more water and starking mixing in my diet drinks; third week was 1 can of my normal stuff and the rest was water & diet drinks. The fourth week was fairly easy letting it go because my body was used to the new stuff.    I do still have my beloved Mountain Dew if I go out to dinner but I always order a water to go along with it and limit myself to one refill.  I try to think of it now as a kind of dessert (easy to do because of the sugar)|`|673e1801dcbf44f2f32732159d3c6799aa	id go diet. now, i know it tastes different, but just think. if your dinking 300 calories a bottle of reg. cherri coke, thats more than 1 hour on a tread mill! with diet, you have 0 calories, 0 time on a tread mill!|`|VOVjebIoaa	Well personally, I hate soda, but that's just me. However, my sister is in LOVE with soda. If you're going to have it, drink it in moderation. Have a family member hide the box from you and have 1 every 3 to 4 days or so. Good luck!|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Ugh me to, so I'm gonna look at the answers. Sorry for not being able to help, but I'm looking to cut my addiction back|`|KQGYNBDJaa	soda is horrible for you.  the high fructose corn syrup causes significant health problems, and one can of coke is equivalent to about 40 teaspoons of sugar.  it's great that you're trying to cut soda out of your diet.  try diet soda; its still bad for you (artificial sweetener) but it's not loaded with sugar and calories.  allow a diet soda a day (if your case is severe) and the gradually cut it to one every two days for a week, then one every three days for a week, etcetera, until you have cut back to a diet soda on special occasion.  and because you're cutting back on "soda" (i'm from minnesota and only know it as "pop"), dont gorge on candy or other sweets, either.  dry diet snapple, and drink lots of water!!|`|AEAxZEveaa	I would try some sugar free koolaid to help wean yourself off. It's still sweet, but it doesn't have the carbonation. Then start watering it down until you're drinking water.|`|KMnyaCwUaa	try club soda;    no cal. & same bubbly taste.     or maybe try to limit yourself too  with diet soda too.|`|ZIUK6UzRaa	i am just the same, and the way i drink less is to find something healthier that i enjoy drinking. Here are some things that work for me:    - V8, the fruit and vegetable kind, not just vegetable. It really does taste good, and gives you servings of fruits and veggies in each glass    - Carrot juice, i know it sounds gross but i get tropical carrot juice, and it is DELICIOUS! it doesnt even taste like carrots, i promise.|`|pC6aV4K8aa	it depends on how many u drink a day. try to drink 1 or 2, maybe even three, a day and the rest of the time try to drink water or even flavored water|`|i8ySLyjLaa	oh gosh, those are my two favorite drinks! just try not buying any more. or you could try rationing yourself to just one cup a day and slowly cutting back to like three a week and then to just one on a saturday and then none at all.    try not to go too fast or you will go into withdrawal. it happens to me all of the time. it sucks!|`|EhfGorc9aa	For dieting your ultimate goal is to try to cut out both the sugar and the carbonation.  The carbonation bloats your stomach and also drains your bones of calcium.  You could start by trying to switch to diet, and then wean yourself off by buying flavored carbonated seltzer water in Cherry flavor or other flavors you like.  Buy cherry juice and mix it half and half.  That way you are cutting down on the sugar and soda addiction too.  I have weaned myself off of diet coke like that. I like the mango seltzer with mango juice!  Another alternative is to buy those little packets of flavor crytals like Crystal Light and add to a water bottle! Drink more water as it helps with the metabolism of fat. The key is to try other drinks that are sugar free and mix them with a touch of natural juice for a healthier drink.  Good luck.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	I quit soda cold turkey.  replace it with ice cold water.  It can be hard, trust me, but once you do your body will thank you for it.  The cavities I had were horrible, and the amount of weight I put on freshman year because of the soda I drank was out of this world.      It will probably take a few days, but it's much easier than quitting smoking or something.|`|089pBKzxaa	I was too! But found out I was diabetic so I had no choice to cut them out.  Not easy but this is what I did.  I allowed myself 1 can a day but poured into a glass filled with ice and sipped it slowly, as the ice melted it watered it down and therefore  I managed to get three glasses out of one can and spaced them out during the day.    Then eventually I changed to diet soda, not the same I know, but once you get used to the taste, you will think normal sodas are too sweet.    Good luck!|`|Vt6X62ovaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - consume less food and workout more often - the difficulties arise when we actually try to put that into operation! There are loads of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The sole method which really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost 30 pounds, it really does produce results!
W2z5dCrmaa	Hey Dude    I know what you are feeling Man. I'm 24 now and married, and have had a chance to deal with it all and sort out the stuff.    When puberty happens, testosterone kicks in, and us dudes view our whole environment and surroundings from a sexual perspective and context.    It isn't a mistake, and you shouldn't feel bad about it. it's just such a new thing that your brain doesn't know how to interpret the new information that is coming in through the filter of testosterone, or even what to make of the new perceptions.    As your stage, a certain shape of even an object could become sexual. A certain color like baby blue could become a sexual meaning. smooth shiny and slippery as a visual image could become totally a turn on or sexual, let alone real Ladies with Lady parts.  The idea of stuff that you would never do can give sexual feelings.    There's nothing wrong with you Man, you aren't evil, warped or disturbed. Your a good Dude, and this is a strange and new experience for you. It isn't about bad or sin, but just the simple part of life where you get stuck with the job of sorting it all out against reality and deciding what to trash and what to stay with. You learn that everything that pops up in the mind as being sexually interesting, flashy, and stimulating to thought isn't supposed to be done or even tried out....like I say, much of it is symbolic of something else, like even the idea of feeling horny and needing to hold off while more desire builds, becomes a feel of sexual fantasy in itself, and that's an example of symbolic excitement. Waiting and feeling strong urges in reality isn't exciting. The fulfilling of them would really be.      Most of the thoughts and wild imaginations will have some actual sexual connections, but will still be symbolic in many ways as well.  Here is where you can bring in values and good background to sort and direct things to reality.    As you mature you still stay horny, but you get it more together and are able to better follow personal meaning and values.    Sex is a real gift, and in time, you will get to appreciate it for how awesome it is, and also get to have and enjoy it when the timing and place in life is right for it.

Just because it's winter doesn't mean you can't be allergic to things inside your home, like harsh cleansers, mold, mildew, dust, dust mites, animal dander, house plants, etc. Try taking an OTC allergy med like generic Claritin, called loratadine, and see if that takes the edge off. If it does, chances are, you're allergic to something(s).

Ganja has numerous amounts of varied chemicals, and the soot your bronchioles clogged with can cause less oxygenated blood to be dispensed by the heart thus plaques have form and a valve was damaged.  It was all about the ganja smoking you did, then YOU WANT TO GO BACK AND COMPLETELY KILL YOURSELF AFTER A GRUELLING SURGERY WHERE DOCTORS GAVE YOU A NEW VALVE.  BROTHER YOU DO NOT LOVE YOURSELF, AND SHOULD NOT COME ON YAHOO ANSWER FOR OPINIONS.  SO IF YOU GOT SOMEONE SAYS YES, YOU WOULD SMOKE MORE POT.

AEAxZEveaa	It's good that you recognize that you have a problem. Do you have any other symptoms or health problems?    Here's a link to the wikipedia page for intermittent explosive disorder. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermitten...    I don't really have any expertise in this. I've actually never heard of it before. The only advice that I have give, and this may have nothing to do with you. But I used to have terrible anxiety and I figured out that it was connected to gluten intolerance. You may not have the same problems that I did, but it's worth looking into, to see if there's a link between your symptoms and food intolerances. (95% of the serotonin is located in your digestive system) I would suggest looking into an elimination diet. That may be of help and it may not. I'm not sure how much behavioral therapy will be of help to you. It sounds like you don't really need any behavioral modification, you're already controlling yourself very well. It did say that some patients respond to antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. Personally, I would try the diet first and if that doesn't help, you could look into medications. It sounds like you're doing great with what you've got.|`|09zVUMBRaa	You may be bipolar.|`|e11af2059864fde560c420f94bfaea71aa	I doubt you're bipolar because a person with bipolar disorder experiences manic and depressive episodes. During manic episodes, bipolar patients often have delusions and thoughts of grandeur while during depressive episodes, they are down and unwilling to participate in anything.     You obviously are not, because you are having rages, not experiencing extreme mood swings in which you believe in things you normally would not.     You could, however, possibly have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). I'm not really sure to what extent your rages go to, or how your daily life is, but OCDs often have the same rage attacks similar to the one you described where there seems to be an inner fight within. It seems to me that you are getting these attacks pretty strongly, and this could be dangerous to yourself and others.     I would definitely suggest going to a specialist who can carefully look at all aspects of your life, background and so on and through that come to a very careful conclusion. I have only given you a vague conclusion based on many assumptions and what you have told us. With a specialist, they can look at the whole picture and at the same time, figure out how to deal with it. Hopefully, this helps.|`|6tRN09Sdaa	you might be bipolar.
i6RlYFo7aa	no, both cut and uncut guys should was their penis and wear a condom in order to prevent infections    the whole myth that says "it's hygienic to cut the skin off" has been debunked, don't believe any of that biased and incorrect "info"|`|TsjqzanQaa	Being uncircumcised is normal and natural.    Circumcision is unnatural and abnormal.    Having a foreskin doesn't make a man more susceptible to disease, that is a bunch of old wive's tales and lies put forth by the medical profession to try to get more males mutilated by circumcision.    Doctors make money from circumcision, and also are very frequently members of the religions that try to mutilate all males with circumcision.    HIV isn't prevented by circumcision, that's another lie.      In the US, at the height of the epidemic, about 80% of men were cicrumcised, yet the US had a much higher rate of infection than the countries that didn't mutilate males with circumcision.       If anything, this would indicate that circumcised males are more at risk for HIV.      Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|7q9MN1Wkaa	If you bathe regularly, then there is absolutely NO difference.  There is not enough medical evidence to support the theory that circumcised is "healthier".  Heck, 70% of the world's males still have their foreskins.  If it were THAT unhealthy, the world would be in BIG trouble!    If a guy were FILTHY and bathes like ONCE a MONTH, then there would be a higher likelihood of getting infections under the foreskin.  It would smell worse than a circumcised penis too.    Otherwise, there is no reason to circumcise.|`|K4zsztkRaa	No you don't.  As long as you ise a thing called soap and water, you don't.  Studies have shown that circumcised men are no less at risk for getting anything over an uncircumcised man as well as they practice good hygiene.    There are myths out there that say it's healthier, or cleaner, or you are less likley to get infections or STD's. Those aren't true.  Infact all of the studies that have ever been able to show any correlation between STD's and circumcision were done in Africa. And they were only correlations, they never proved that uncircumcised men were less likley to get infections, they just concluded it "might" be the case. But no study preformed in America or any other country for that matter has been able to prove anything.  America has a very high STD rate as well as a very high circumcision rate. So therfore circumcision can't prevent people from getting STD's. Or lower their chances of getting one.  Also there have been myths out there that circumcision greatly reduces your chances of getting penile cancer, that's false.  Denmark (in fact is trying to make a law stating that it's illegal to circumcise and infant.) has the lowest penils cancer rate in the world and one of the lowest circumcision rates. So that myth can't be true either.  Men in Europe, who usually only bathe once or twice a week, don't get as many infections as men here in the US. So that proves circumcision doesn't reduce your chances of getting an infection either.    People today still buy into the myths that say it's so much healthier.  If it really hurt us as much as people say it does, then we wouldn't be born with it.    -Connor|`|CNW6eAjoaa	No, it is better and healthier to be intact or not circumcised.  The foreskin and glans together produce anti microbial compounds that fight off disease.  Cutting this skin off means there is not more disease protection.  The circumcision scam is just that.  It is based on myths and untruths.  If it is so much healthier, why is the US, which is one of the main circumcising cultures in the world hosting the highest rate of AIDs of any first world country? The stories and the reality just do not add up.  Europe, which is not a circumcising culture has one of the lowest rates for STDs and AIDs.  Even Islamic cultures have AIDs.  You are better and further ahead to remain intact, and to leave your sons intact.  Connor and EW have already provided some good answers.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	A few decades ago, doctors advocated douching for women, to wash out the inner recesses of the vagina. It was popular for a time but then people realized that disrupting the natural flora in there actually makes infections more likely. Nature's own system is very good at keeping everything working properly.    Similarly, the foreskin works to protect the penis and keep it clean. Smegma (produced by males and females) keeps the parts soft and fights off infection. Getting rid of it is only necessary if you're expecting oral sex. Otherwise, simply rinsing in the shower is all that's needed to flush away the dead skin cells and let the penis continue maintaining itself.    The rate of complications from circumcision is comparable to the rate of problems with a natural penis. But surgical complications tend to be serious, while foreskin problems are almost always very minor. So it's healthier to be natural.|`|jOFRD9sLaa	"...the conclusion is always there ready-made before the thinking process; the thinking does not serve, as in the rational realm, to arrive at a correct conclusion; rather, it serves to confirm an already existing irrational conclusion and to rationalize it. This is generally called "prejudice"; what is overlooked is that this prejudice has social consequences of considerable magnitude, that it is very wide-spread and practically synonymous with what is called 'inertia and tradition'; it is intolerant, that is, it does not tolerate the rational thinking which might do away with it; consequently, the thinking of the emotional plague is inaccessible to arguments; it has its own technique within its own realm, its own 'logicality', as it were; for this reason, it gives the impression of rationality without being actually rational."|`|RhkdnHPVaa	If you clean properly you should have no problem with either.|`|R9OfKCEjaa	Unless you are a really dirty person who doesn't shower regularly and let stuff build up under the foreskin, it really doesn't make that much difference. It just looks nicer and is a Jewish tradition.... Uncircumsized sex apparantly feels better, but how would you know? Usually ppl are done when a baby, so you can't miss what you don't know!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No you don't. You can't get a foreskin problem, but that applies if you remove any body part - take out you teeth and you won't have cavities. Foreskin problems are rare and easily treatable. Other than that it's about the same. Some studies have shown circumcised guys acquire STDs less easily, but other studies have shown no difference or circumcised guys acquiring STDs more easily, and so in practical terms you need to wear a condom either way. It's not healthier to be circumcised.    Harriet|`|gUWcvxzuaa	1. That's one part of your body where you want as much "meat" as possible... ;)  2. We evolved that way for a reason.  3. Cleaning and hygiene "down there" should be done regardless.   4. The cells of the inside layer of your foreskin can actually help control or prevent minor infections in many cases. Conversely this makes them mose susceptible to picking up HIV for that very reason.  5. Wear condoms.|`|B8e8x60Saa	actually you do enjoy sex more.. when you are snipped :0).. as there is a area jus below the head where feel quite good.. when you aren't circumcisd you wont enjoy it as much.. cant remember where.. but look it up oprah.. i know.. sound lame.. but hey why be ashamed when you want to know abt your own body... oh and it a bit safer than when not snipped (nothin is safe)|`|4arnbpUCaa	As long as you have good hygiene (i.e. wash under your foreskin each day) you are no more at risk.|`|nqcnylFpaa	i don't know because i was born with no foreskin over my penis yes people it can happen cause the skin sometimes will not develop over the penis and i have done research that the uncircumcised and circumcised are both natural a lot of people are not born with the foreskin and a lot of people are plus circumcise can be traced back to 18,000 years ago the foreskin is just a bunch of leftover skin it really is not that big of a deal if you have it or not and i am highly against the restore foreskin idea just a waste of money and medical research there are worst medical problems out there and losing a small piece of skin is not a big deal having no foreskin does not make you less of a man complaining about it does.|`|kkyr4B53aa	Yes, it is safer to be circumsised.

iRN4HuzIaa	Well, first you absolutely do not give the plastic one back.  You paid for it.  If he insists you show him where in the contract there is a note about giving back a plastic retainer or paying out a fee.  Look at the detail in your contract for braces to see what it includes.  Like aftercare etc.  Read through it thoroughly.  Call other doctors in the area.  Tell them you need braces and that you are comparison shopping.  How much, what it includes...  Get someone else to call your doc and do the same.  Ask specifically about the retainer and whether they cover rebracing if the teeth move from lack of retainer.    What a miserable twit he is.  Worst case, get ALL of your records and molds from that little bastardo (you bought and paid for it) and take it to ANOTHER dentist to have him fit you with a retainer.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	I think YOU Have a problem, you want something for nothing....you just said your teeth were bad because you DIDN'T wear your retainer...so which is it ??? you wore a retainer, but it didn't work so you got braces ? or you got braces, didn't wear the retainer and now you're blaming the dentist/orthodontist for something YOU did or didn't do ??? if you want straight teeth, either pay for them or don't..but don't blame the person who's helping you for things YOU do or don't do...|`|DN3lPdE0aa	im getting mines of on feb 18 and  the ortho said that the retainers are included. but if they break or w/e then i will have to pay $100-$300 i think..im getting the metal ones.|`|67fN59osaa	im gettin my braces off in 2 months (thank god) and the ortho said that a retainer comes with it, u got ripped off|`|awFbOgbIaa	Shouldn't your insurance cover it?

I work for an orthodontic office and all cases that are started here include retainers (metal ones) your choice of color design you can even add a picture...at no extra charge!! see some doctors like patient satifactory and really money isn't that big of an issue. oh and the office i work in is a private office!! bye what you are saying it sounds like you were ripped off and that really sucks!!  you should only be charged for a retainer if it is broken or misplaced!!  I think you should call the turko files(News)

fk9AvB25aa	Get in tune with your symptoms and if you have any signs of an out break then do not have any kind of sex with your wife until the out break has completely healed and gone away. Out breaks are contagious while they are active until they completely go away. There is less of a risk of passing herpes when there is no out break but there is still a small chance of passing herpes when there are no signs of an out break. You should let your wife know that you have genital herpes, if she doesn't know all ready.  You may also want to think about going on suppressive therapy this will also reduce your out breaks and reduce your chances of passing herpes on.|`|Z0SiMz7daa	The use of condoms during intercourse should provide protection, but she may be a little suspicious if you haven't used condoms with her in the past.

8wpav3nwaa	If you're already a healthy weight, yet you are gaining unwanted weight, then you're eating too many calories. Otherwise, don't worry about it--you're probably eating an adequate amount for the amount of exercise you're doing!    (I'm not a big fan of obsessing over the strict rules of 'healthy Body Mass Index' or whatnot, except as a very loose guideline... in the case of athletes especially, it's practically useless)    It might be that the total volume of the food you consume is causing the bloating. All that fiber absorbs a lot of water(I'm vegan and it happens to me too). You could try replacing a percentage of the food you eat with high protein foods: they pack more calories for the volume. You might feel more satisfied after eating a few cups of high protein food compared to a few cups of salad, thereby reducing the total volume of your intake. Or it could be that all those raw veggies are pretty hard to digest... you could try replacing a percentage of the food you eat with stuff that's easier & quicker for your body to break down, like simple carbs.|`|ygTr3fvVaa	You might be sensitive to one of the foods you eat. Start a food journal, write down f, when and foods and how they made you feel.|`|tJa60S4Taa	That's not much, that's fine,|`|bGNBEtImaa	That is right about the level you should be eating to maintain your body mass. Assuming, you do not have large amounts of lean muscle. If you do, then it could be as high as 3,000.|`|Wu0XyNspaa	Well it looks like you're pretty active and at a good weight and height (you must be a slim build though).    If you aren't gaining (or losing) weight while eating 2200 calories, it's fine.  You probably just have a fast metabolism (a common characteristic of naturally slim people).  If you're feeling bloated, you may be intolerant of a food group, such as gluten or dairy.

WzFfD82saa	No. Do NOT fast. What you need to do it to diet AND excercise. Even when you do exercise you WILL gain muscle but by exercising you will burn the fat rather than losing muscle to fuel your body if you just diet/fast. Once you lose the fat and gain some muscle then you can let your muscle atrophy OR continue working out to be strong and fit.  Hope this helps, and do NOT fast. It is very unhealthy and you will only lose muscle not fat.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Well, if your looking to look better, although the scale goes down fasting wont help for these reasons    1- You will put on a lot of fat, as muscle is used for energy.    2-you will actually get bigger at first because your muscle is what holds fat from going jiggly like crazy.    3- your organs will begin to be digested by your body, which will leave you with life long heart and lung liver kidney problems    So if you want to die soon, by all means go ahead.|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	instead of not eating.how about you replace the bad foods with healthy food :) sounds like a good plan to me.    dont starve!|`|At7WLduQaa	of course it will work|`|ALQuQaLGaa	Not eating anything slows your metabolism DOWN.      I would talk to a dietitian about which foods accelerate your metabolism.    Weightlifting can help with your problem... the more muscle mass you have, the faster you burn calories.

In the summer i decided to take active measures and not eat!     From June to August 3 months...  I lost 8kg and dropped back to around the 71kg mark.    I use to not eat the whole day and have some fast food (which i love!) in the evening. slowly my body got use to this and i really never felt hungry much, i did, however stay active. I would give the fasting a miss but stick to one decent meal a day.    GL.  Weight loss is to the human what Space travel is to the cave man.|`|I54KyS8Laa	Yes, as some of the posts suggest fasting can be dangerous if done for too long a time, but fasting (if done right) can actually be healthy in that it gives your liver a chance to detoxify.   I found that the key to fasting was to never do it for more than two days at a time and did it routinely while in college (over week-ends) since our mess hall was shut down on Sundays.   Drinking water is totally OK--in fact necessary during your fast.     If you're not taking supplement--the best multivitamin is The Complete Nutritional System by Rainbow Light Company available in most health food stores. It's balanced and hypoallergenic. And it I may also suggest some good reading is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz to build a great self image. It's a book that everyone eventually reads it and the sooner the better.     Good luck,    Richard K|`|rvBNDSXnaa	your weights is perfect for that height, well kinda. i used to weighted 176lbs, lost 36lbs in 3months with a good workout plans.

XD|`|l3Wq57gsaa	no it wont work...well actually it will but it wont be the loss that you want. you will shed pounds but your metabolism will slow down and your body goes into starvation mode so any foods you eat after that will quickly turn into fat.

Being skinny can be down to genetics.  If you are starving yourself then that is very dangerous.  If you are taking care of yourself when you are hungry you are fine.|`|9rhBpBvhaa	Bit of a generalised question to answer.   No, not as of yet.   If you are intentionally not eating, then this is bad.   If it's in your genes to be skinny (ask your Mum/Dad if they've always been skinny) then you can still do something to bring your weight up.  You need to start working on bringing your BMI up to a healthy weight.  This involves eating more. And eating more of the right things.   You need to go and see your doctor, and they can kit you out with a health plan, which can help you gain weight steadily.   If you stay underweight for a long period of time, your hair can fall out, nails become brittle, brittle bones, dark shadows appear under your eyes, and you get an unhealthy yellowish tint to your skin.   So please, go and see your doctor and work on bringing your weight up.   Hope this helps.|`|koZLsY28aa	what are 6 stone?|`|bVIewZe9aa	not yet, seeing as though you're still here.  but lose more weight, then yeah, possibly.  eat more.|`|8skZoXPRaa	If its your natural weight - no.

If you develop symptoms then it doesn't matter how tight the valve is, that is reason for replacement.|`|TORBP6QIaa	It depends on how much affect it is having on your life as well as the amount of stenosis...    visit this website and you will find some examples of when others have had the surgery for stenosis doen.  I had my valve replacement for a different reason so I am not up to speed on stenosis figures.    http://www.valvereplacement.com/|`|eLd7RgF2aa	That is based on your ejection fraction, which can be determined by a cath. This is definitely a question for your doctor. Stenosis can worsen very slowly or not at all... You don't mention your age. If you are a child and not fully grown, there is more of a possibility that you will have to have it replaced sometime in the future.     I have had mine replaced and went on to water ski, snow ski and live a great life!!  So, not to panic. Keep your weight in line, eat a healthy diet and get a fair amount of exercise (after clearing this with your doc).      My best to you!

I asked my specialist about it last week and he told me it was a common side effect from the buckle in your eye.    So everything is fine, its just very annoying huh?

Chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Chlamydia can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth.  Any sexually active person can be infected with chlamydia. The greater the number of sex partners, the greater the risk of infection. Because the cervix (opening to the uterus) of teenage girls and young women is not fully matured and is probably more susceptible to infection, they are at particularly high risk for infection if sexually active. Since chlamydia can be transmitted by oral or anal sex, men who have sex with men are also at risk for chlamydial infection.|`|mv34vUTnaa	if they are asking you to contact them then you may have it.    but you just need to talk some tablets they provide you with and you will be fine    =]|`|eKzraNH7aa	i dnk think u hav it jus get a regular check up every 6weeks|`|055bc91a2b5cb79b4a24d0669b5329efaa	I would go and get tested again to be on the safe side.. im going to get a full smear to test for everything after the guy i am seeing is after giving me herpes:( im soo upset i really trusted him and he never told me anything i guess he is just a guy who likes his cake and eats it!... a bit 2 much..   sorry to hear you regret your termination i would be the same i never would have gone through with it but at the time it must have seemed right :)  good luck and do go again and get re-tested to stop your worrying :)|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Could be anything just go back and hear what they have to say and don't get yourself worked up for nothing.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	is all that worry doing you any good?  do you enjoy being worried?  for crying out loud, call the clinic and get your results and then deal with it.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Contact the clinic, then panic if it is bad.

EQ7T9xigaa	i read there are some circle lens that are for people with astigmatism, just get the ones that are toric circle lens (i think the brand GEO have toric lens). or just get plano (0.00) ones, so they wont affect your eyes.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	Your astigmatism must be very mild if you don't wear any correction for it.    At any rate, having astigmatism makes no difference in how a lens will fit if you aren't correcting it anyway.    The base curve of the lens will determine if it will fit you right or not.    Circle lenses don't make your eyes look bigger, just the iris looks huge, like a Japanese cartoon character.
cRuqfZdsaa	Wow. i'm so glad i found your question. i have had a headache for 354 days straight. yeah it's been intense. i went to the doctor around day 30 (didn't worry for a while because i get headaches from previous whiplash) and i had to go to the hospital to get a CT scan. i was 14 at the time and now i'm 15. they said it was to check for anything abnormal that would cause pressure inside the head..i guess like a brain tumor or something similar. but don't be alarmed. i've seen a pediatrician, got a CT scan, been to an ear nose throat doctor, allergist, neurologist, and now i see a headache specialist. they think it's mostly from stress but they can't figure out why i've had a headache this long..i mean it's been almost a year. but anyways don't be alarmed it's probably just precautionary.  i'm not sure if it will come back early if anything is abnormal though. mine came back in about 4 days. everything was fine, execpt i have a deviated septum..but that doesn't have anything to do with headaches. hope that helped a little.|`|rdzcF7R8aa	He was looking for meningitis, hydrocephaly, or a brain tumor.

Today is just Monday, so, depending on when you went Friday, he may not have the report.  That said, if it is anything serious, you will be notified immediately.    I hope this helps!

You could go to the ER, but as this is an old wound, and not life threatening, you would be in for a wait.  That bill would also be considerably higher.  Since it's been a week, there isn't much that can be done short of surgery if a fracture is impeding blood supply to the finger.

yNvA3Wreaa	Never had an STD, my husband and I were both virgins when we got married.  I don't think this is necessary but does reduce your exposure!      I can understand your feelings about wanting to put off sex until you're in a good relationship.  You're above average with your number of lifetime partners, which isn't necessarily bad but can mean you end up with some resentment from the relationships that didn't go well.  And the last guy--if you say no, that means NO, and him going ahead and having sex with you was date rape.  The situation should be entirely within each partner's control, and you should decide mutually how far you want to go.  He had a total lack of respect for you and committed a legal and moral crime.  These cases are hard to prosecute, and it sounds like you don't want to do so.  I do think you should meet with a therapist to talk about it, because you may find that the experience hurt you more than you realize at the moment.     Regarding whether a guy might think less of you, not unless he's a hypocrit!  Most guys are thrilled to have sex, and don't wait until they're married, so it would be inconsistent to expect you to be a virgin.  Some guys do, of course, since we still have to deal with the remnants of the Madonna/whore dichotomy, but these guys you just don't date!|`|jkTRaxFGaa	I found out Thursday that I had chlamydia. It sucks! I have been with my boyfriend for about 8yrs. The last couple years of our relationship has been over a long distance. I'm in my early 20s so we've been together for a long time. He has gotten tested and is waiting for his results now. Our last time together was about a month ago. I have cheated in the past and so has he but we've moved on and recommitted ourselves to one another since. This is our pasts coming back to haunt us. We just plan on going on with our lives and using this as a stepping stone. Just happy that it was something that can be cured and nothing I'd have to live with forever.
4BQXYxPYaa	This isn't OCD.    But if it bothers you, just stop watching the movies.|`|AA11906603	Maybe I would want to treasure it, but I would rather let it wash over me, trickle into me, fill me with its beauty, warmth and perfume than try to force anything. If you force something you can keep it, but the pleasure may no longer be as vivid. Do you remember your dreams? Sometimes the physical laws of nature don't really correspond to dreams, books or movies, but you can experience a lot of pleasure flying, swimming, skimming, solving mysteries in all these frameworks. A book, a dream, a movie or a memory is a precious friend no one can take away from you. You can visit a bit when life is not so sunny. The only trouble here is that in the end you are going to need a real life too. A virtual life will not be enough for you. Everything in balance. Everything will reveal itself to you in its own time.|`|eibO5ax3aa	Zelda answered beautifully. I can't out reason your OCD, because it has nothing to do with reason.

HsZp3pSKaa	there are several sexual stimulants in the girls body. the earlobe, the neck, the breast, and behind the knee|`|MXRXG62oaa	idk ive always thought of breasts as being the things that feed the baby and i dont view them as sexual... my bf loves to look at mine though. i suppose thats because their covered all the time. in cultures where woman dont wear shirts its not as hot for the guys, they dont view them as sexual. Like in some tribes. The purpose of breasts is for milk anyways.  now what effect do I get from it? Nothing, i dont really get any feelings from my breasts. I like the thought of my bf touching them, thats a turn on. But physically its just like holding my hand.

X2BcMJZGaa	Hi there.     The way you describe it I would advise the following: Make your sister her favorite food/beverage, help her relax and get comfortable, and let her know that you love her and you're there to help her out. Ask her what's going on in her life, aside from what she appears to be freaking out about. Ask her about school, her friends, boys, family members, everything you can think of . Reassure her that anytime she needs someone to talk to, you're there for her.    If this doesnt calm her down, and she continues having these anxiety attacks, and your parents are not seeking help for her, suggest they find some.    You can find a wide variety of anxiety scales (Stress = anxiety) here: http://www.neurotransmitter.net/anxietys...  I am not suggesting you test her on these, only that it might help for you to look at a few of them and get an idea of what questions you could ask her, or what to look for.|`|D0JsiC0Paa	It's not a mental illness as such; it's just quite a common personality trait across that spectrum - it's perfectionism. Now, I could go into a lot of detail about cognitive processes associated with its explanation, stress and anxiety models, the concepts of 'musturbation' and 'I-can't-stand-it-itis', but don't worry, it doesn't seem to be anything as sinister as a mental illness, just a bit of an obsession with control and perfection, which can border on something that needs treatment if it begins to affect her life and that of other people - but if you put 'perfectionism' into a search engine - you should get a good match up. However, its the begginings of a stress disorder or stress related nervous breakdown because as things get harder and you move up through life, out of school and face tighter deadlines with more difficult tasks - perfectionism is something you actually have to fight or you could end up really losing hair over small things and getting nowhere.    PTSD - is a whole different ball game.|`|39x9tNJzaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV_Code...    Her behavior could be as simple as being a spoiled brat, it could be something as complex as a personality disorder.  Talk to your parents about it, and maybe talk to her about it if you don't think she'll feel threatened.
3Y2jRkxcaa	I am twelve and I have been J/O for a year and I just ran out of semen on Sunday, now it is back but I think you should just stop for a few days and let it build up|`|MhfneF0xaa	If by 6/7 you mean how many times each day you masturbate, yeah, that could cause weak orgasms and small amounts of semen, but that would be normal. You haven't caused any damage, you're just making your sex organs a little tired. Cut back a little, it should help.    Unless masturbation interferes with other activities, there is no such thing as too much. Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.    EDIT: if by 6/7 you mean 6 or 7 inches for penis size (erect) then you are at or slightly above average for an *adult.* So again, no worries.|`|8xKWXRmoaa	Dude I'm 14 to and I havnt had that problem.

Run run run...|`|xqOWI8VUaa	Again...there is no such thing as spot reduction. If u want to lose the fat around ur stomach area u have to lose it in ur whole body in general. Lots of cardio, healthy foods and a good exercise that targets the oblique muscles is side bends. I heard the lying doing bicycle ab exercise is also good. How ur abs will look mostly depends on ur diet. U can have alot of muscle there but u wont be able to see it if u have a huge layer of fat blocking it.|`|qnURfWqdaa	you need to work your lower back as well as your abs...i have them  too and theyre the only thing keeping me from a 6 pack...try some leg flutters .....or look some up online|`|nAvTMXmgaa	you need cardio to burn fat. AND workout to built muscle  So you can do whatever cardio you like the most or at least one that you can do like jogging or biking or aerobic.    And workouts usually are regular crunches. And one that helps a lot is called the bycicle crunch : lay in your back with hands on side and use you legs as you were pedaling a bycicle. Then as you go and get stronger you can add a body twist to it. It will really work all you muscles in you abdomen,    Also you can do a side plank from pilates they are very easy. But try the begginers plank first.     You need to do it at least 3 times a week. You will see results.  Rember you can do abs workout but if you dont do cardio you will feel you abs muscle getting stronger but the fat arounda your waist that will still be there.!!!!!  Good luck!|`|iJlqUY4jaa	biking
4vC4Z1roaa	im no expert but you dont really have to wear your contacts during the flight right??  i mean i can see pretty fine without contacts but im nearsighted  this way you can save contacts and you wont have to take them off put them on .....    and contacts are pretty good for about 2 weeks if you have the soft ones|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I am a wearer myself for more than 20 years. I wear my contact from the time I wake up in the morning till I go to bed at 10pm. I didn't change them during my wearing period. The eyes have tears to keep the lens moist. So if you try to clean them during flight, chances are you might loss them in the plane wash-room, as the plane is a bit shaky and small. Best, if you are that worry, bring a small bottle of lens artificial tears to periodically wet them.|`|5656d5ab22b21df010a9c35d05e22c81aa	I wear my contacts when I travel and really only rewet them when needed. You know your eyes best and will know when the contacts start to feel a little dry.
nksewi03aa	There are two types of "blind" people.  Those that are legally blind and have very low vision, but some light perception or even movement perception, or those that are congenitally blind.  Legally blind people can detect some amount of color, and certainly variations from bright (white or hazy white) light to no light (black).    Some people are either born blind from birth, or have no memory of ever having had sight (if they become blind before age 2 for example). These people do not know "light".  They can not even rub their eyes hard to experience light flashes because their retinas are dead, and without the retina, there are no pressure flashes.  Their brain has never experienced light or color, so it literally does not exist for them.  They do not see black for that matter, they simply exist in the other 4 senses.    A famous experiment in the 70's planted an electrode into the visual centers of the brain of congenitally blind patients, thus bypassing the retinas and eye.  A small electric shock let them see a flash of white.  None of them had the ability to describe what they saw, because they had never seen "white" before.  The could only describe it in terms of temperature, touch, or sound.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	How can blind people see?|`|qJ1LJ9Wjaa	It could be any or all, or nothing.    Have you ever been in bed and rubbed your eye's for awhile, and noticed a bunch of colors?  That is what most blind people see.  But this is called "Partial Blindness"    A person whom is completely blind, is not able to have the sense of "seeing"  They won't see anything-- not even black or white, your colors.  they aren't exactly aware that they have eyes!  Do you understand what I'm getting at? :)

xhjSPd0uaa	1. i was told not to chew gum and so were any of my friends that had braces, it can damage them, which means you'd have to wear them longer coz he'd have to fix them an kinda start over!    2. i was given a special toothbrush for braces and an interdental toothbrush (thin long bristles) so i can get in the gaps, and floss, and mouthwash. your ment to use all these things coz theres more chance of your teeth decaying while the braces are there.    3. you can start eating hard foods whenever you feel comfortable! but try not to eat like toffee or crusty hard bread etc. coz that can damage your braces.    4. its fine if you accidentaly swallow the wax, they wouldnt make the wax toxic as it goes in your mouth=chances are alot of people will swallow it.    5. painkillers and a hot water bottle/heat pad on the area that aches, really helps!!! keep yourself busy, go out with friends, watch a film, paint your nails, surf the net, anything to take your mind off of them    6. *keep your teeth apart as much as possible (like when your just sittin watchin tv or something, make sure your bottom & top teeth arent touching atall) this stops alot of pain.    *hygiene is soo important while you have braces, if you havent got them already, you need little interdental brushes like this   http://whatsinasmile.files.wordpress.com...  you can get them in lots of different sizes from your orthodontist or in drugstores,   brush your teeth/brace with a normal toothbrush first, brushing in small circles, then use that little brush to clean the gaps like what the person is doing in the photo.  then use floss, thread the floss through each gap, being careful, an gently floss between your teeth  then use a mouthwash that contains Fluoride    watch this vid for help!   http://www.howcast.com/videos/206-How-To...      also read this, very helpful   http://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Braces|`|TKYC9gsiaa	1. yes as long as its sugar free or the brace (the color thingy) will fall out.  2.no it wont break your braces :)  3. when your mouth stops hurtin. PS dont eat apples whole; cut then in half . ( trust me on this one)  4. if you swallow the wax nothing will happen. They wouldnt let you put anything in your mouth if it would hurt you :)  5. wax, advil, might take the pain away for a little. The pain should go away in a week or so.  6. Dont eat hard bread! (the little kinds if ya know what i'm talking bout) dont eat ice or the bracket might break, dont chew on pens or erasers, brush your teeth to prevent stains, beware of getting food stuck in your teeth.    other than that good luck!|`|Nd8kf0h8aa	Yes you can normally chew sugar free not stickey gum and if you swallow the wax it wont harm you at all ( i have an expander and it has brackets soooo) the pain will go away as your mouth gets stronger where the bracket is rubbing (normally whithen a week)  tips  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  1. try not to close your mouth hard (the brackets wont bug you as much  2. if you are in sports make sure you have a mouth gaurd  3. DONT PICK AT THE BRACKETS!!!!!!    i hope the pain goes down and i also hope i helped! :)|`|2gFBP0MVaa	1. yes, but it has to be sugar free...otherwise it tends to stick...(i learned that the hard way)  2. i use a regular toothbrush from the store, but make sure that they are extra soft bristles...and sometimes you need the skinny brush (often called the Christmas tree brush) which brushes in between the braces...  3. when the pain goes away. i started eating hard foods about a week later...  4. nothing. the wax is designed so that it is harm free if you swallow it. (just dont make a habit of it. lol)  5. after about a month, you totally forget you have them. i used orajel on any open sores i had in my mouth from the braces. i also used to take Tylenol an hour before going to the orthodontist to get my braces tightened...by then, your mouth is all relaxed so you dont get sore.  6. LISTEN TO THE ORTHODONTIST! if he tells you 'dont do blahblahblah' LISTEN to him...they know what they are talking about...they went to school...i didnt listen and i had to wear mine for an extra 6 months.|`|dubFy83Raa	i recently got braces too.  1.they said that you can chew gum as long as its sugar-free :)  2.no brushing your teeth cannot break the braces. Brush often as possible after they stop hurting to prevent white spots when they take the braces off.  3.whenever your teeth can handle it. Make sure it dosent hurt when you try to eat harder foods. if it still does, stick to soft foods for a little while longer.  4. it dosent matter if you swallow the wax. it cant hurt you. ive swallowed it many times and my orthodontist said it wouldn't hurt you.  5.you can't ignore the metal in your mouth since it will be there for a long time, but you can relieve the pain by taking pain killers such as advil, tylenol, ibuprofen, etc.  6. keep your lips moisturized!!! that is so important! when you have extra stuff, yous lips get dry. keeping them moisturized helps so much!  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|u0LUjS9waa	I have braces 2 :)     you can chew gum but it gets a bit difficult cos it gets stuck in the braces and then it's kinda annoying to try and get out! Brushing your teeth definitely won't break your braces they are really strong! and you just use a normal toothbrush. You can eat most hard foods after a week or two but avoid toffees, they just get stuck in your braces and are really annoying to eat when you have braces!! Nothing happens if you swallow the wax, you probably won't really notice cos its small! Take pain killers if they're really sore, but in a few days you will get totally used to them and won't notice you have them anymore!  good luck with them :D|`|MRlJgANsaa	1. yes, sugar free gum is recomended  2. no, and no, there are however little brushes you can get for between brackets  3. when your teeth aren't sore anymore  4. swallowing wax is nothing to worry about  5. advil, wax, ice, chewing gum  6. chewing gum right after getting them tightened will make your teeth less sore faster.|`|Glarnx6Taa	1. you are not supposed to chew gum, but I have done it millions of times and never ran into trouble  2. In the beginning it would feel better to use soft bristle tooth brush you don't have to, and no brushing your teeth cannot break your braces.  3. Once it doesn't hurt anymore, maybe a week or 2.  4. It won't hurt, it may not taste good, but it definitely won't cause any harm.  5. that's a tough one, don't worry after a couple weeks it won't hurt, and you will get used to the  metal, yeah it is really weird at first, and it hurts. Ibuprofen worked for me sometimes.  6. Tips? I have had braces for about a year now and it only hurts for a couple hours after myweekly appointment, don't worry the pain will go awaty soon, and you will get used to it, GOOD LUCK!!!|`|ATOsDBsRaa	1 i do but some people swear that you cant i chew free dent and trident   2 i have never herd of this but i guess if you do it hard enough   2 i use a compact head one i think it is better  3 it all dependes on your mouth when i got my braces i ate pizza and wings   4 um try not to but if you do its ok unless you have trouble breathin  5 ice cream !!!!!  you will get used to it  after a day or 2   6 if you break a bracket call your ortho. if you ever have to were elastics were them all the time same way with head gear. try not to eat bread it gets stuck alot and it looks gross.get a water pik.  dont be afraid to ask questions .      Good luck|`|JvBVpHMpaa	They make tooth brushes specifically for braces and they make flossers specifically for braces as well.  The platypus ortho flosser is the best thing i've used.  1 minute and I'm done!    I'd say be watchful of what you eat and always brush and floss after you do eat.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	1. The orthodontist advises you against chewing gum because it can get caught in your braces and damage them.  2. You should use a soft toothbrush even without braces and these will not break your braces. Just avoid brushing aggressively.   3. Take Tylenol or some other pain reliever and you can generally start when the pain has subsided.  4. You'll poop it out. No biggy.  5. The pain will subside shortly after you get the braces but in the meantime, Tylenol.. 3 every 6 hours.   6. Just ride out the pain. It will eventually go away and living with braces will be as mindless as breathing. And keep them on the entire time. I had mine taken off early and my teeth quickly shifted. And always wear your retainer! If you don't, again, your teeth will shift. Avoid caramels and other sticky sweets because they may damage your braces. And just generally take care of the braces.. Keep them clean, etc. :) GOod luck!!

0pI5QX8saa	You will definitely not wake up with a pig nose. The way the strips work is that they pull up the sides of your nose, not the front. And even if you're worried about the sides staying up, they will not, trust me. Your nose is a whole lot stronger than the nasal strips. I would really encourage that you use the strips; I used them when I recently had a cold, and it was miraculous! I didn't even use the breathe right kind; I just used a generic CVS brand. Oh, but make sure to hold it in place for the 20 seconds that it says to, or it will just fall off.    Hope this helps!|`|NCaNexfraa	Lol they are not strong enough to do that seriously|`|4e4292bf1256efe9642c669e08c9a126aa	They won't harm your nose in any way, shape, or form  I use them every night so I breath more easily through my nose so i don't breath through my mouth so i don't wake up with cotton mouth =P

PnlgLBcwaa	This is this askers response to my question on FMS  INDEPENT ANT SAID (not me)  "I lean towards agreeing with him.......I know 4 women that have it.    All of them had emotional problems before they started having symptoms of it whether they want to believe it of not. Most people that have emotional or mental problems are not capable of recognizing it."   (WHICH BY TEH WAY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION!)    I SAY  There is a difference between REAL FMS and other conditions that cause similar symprtoms.    Depression itself can cause pain---people can have both depression and FMS--that does not mean ALL FMS is due to emotional problems--in fact the last statistic I saw said that 50% of people with FMS do not have depression.    My symptoms started when I was 5--and a happy go lucky child-playing baseball with my father, spending summers ona boat, etc.....my symptoms started after a serious physical injury--this contradicts the theory that it is an emotional problem    REAL FMS is a disorder of teh neuro system-    It is highly overdiagnosed by incompetant and lazy docs--and those that specialize in hypochondria--but for many of us-FMS is a real physical disease.    It is not (as fibrofix says) a liver problem, thick body fluids, body acid.    It is not autoimmune, inflammatory, a vitamin deficiency, hormonal.    IT IS a problem with the neuro transmitters (bvrain chemicals) and possibly blood profusion in teh brain.    I have many symptoms that could not be attributred to an emotional problem-real physical symptoms-problems with motor planning, balance, dizziness, my legs giving out, migrainesetc....
ZSPTSRHYaa	very good    last sentence-ask a person who smokeS (add s)    middle sentence- I k now that smoking is addictive and is not easy to quit, but there are many ways to quit. ---dont say quit twice    in the first sentence say lung and other cancers instead of what you said at the end    VERY GOOD    i hope i helped!!

NSayh9jDaa	Take iburprofen. You may have an inner ear infection but most likely strep throat. I would see a doctor if pain persists more than 3-4 days. Yeah and drinking a spoonful of honey will do awhile. You can also buy sprays from a drugstore that you simply spray at the back of your throat to numb it.|`|07u50wubaa	if the nymph notes are swollen you should have it checked out but drink honey chamomile tea with honey mixed in with it
yNvA3Wreaa	Walking pneumonia is a lung infection caused by a bacteria called Mycoplasma.  It is called walking pneumonia because the illness is less severe than most pneumonias, and the person who is sick is still able to get around.  Of course he should stay home to recuperate!  His doctor will prescribe any necessary medicine to help him get better faster.|`|Hlrs3aElaa	Pneumonia is a icky disease that causes your lungs to be filled with fluid and the person has a hard time breathing. Walking pneumonia is a milder case, but should be taken seriously.
IVna6e8Maa	Have you been tested for ADHD?  In any case, what I usually do is organize my time to give myself breaks.

pWxh08O9aa	It could be a result of OCD i guess.  OCD presents it self differently in everyone.  I have OCD. I arrange things till they are perfect, wash things, make sure every thing is neat. Think Obsessively, rumination, catastrophic, and intrusive. Check to make sure doors and windows are locked, stove is turned off, lights are off, etc. My friend who has OCD has to enter and re-enter rooms a certain number of times, as well as close the door a certain number of times.  I have been anorexic, but never linked that to the OCD. But i guess a desire for every thing to be perfect could cause anorexia. So it seems very possible.  Probably, yes!|`|AA11309238	It has fallen under that diagnosis, that is why so many anorexic girls are also likely to excel at school.|`|upvLAyyzaa	No.  2 completely different mental disorders.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	Anna is right, anorexia can be a form of OCD.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	I never thought of it but I guess it could be. While it IS an eating disorder it's also a psychological one.
kogsyGAPaa	oh you poor thing no one would answer...  some men can range from one minute to like 10, with the average I'd say in between  It never hurt me, but it can hurt girls the first time because their hymen isn't broken yet, but after a few times, it shouldn't hurt.

nksewi03aa	You should use daily wear contacts for only as long as your eyes are comfortable using them.  Some people can only tolerate them for a few hours, others can have them in 18 hours straight with no irritation.    It has less to do with the amount of time you have your contacts in, than whether you SLEEP in them or not.  Deposits form 25 times faster when your eyes are closed because there are less tears and no rinsing action from normal blinking when you are asleep.    Your prescription will neither improve nor get worse from wearing your contacts either less or more.  Soft lenses only let you see better, they do not physically change your eye.    The answer to your question is that there is no set time period you should or can wear them. Simply do not wear them so much that your eyes get irritated from them.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	No. You can wear your lenses from morning till you go to sleep. You should disinfect it after you have taken them out, ready for the next wearing. And when they are broken, replace them with new ones. That's all to it. I have been wearing contact for more than 20 years adopting the very method that I have taught you. Honestly, different people have different toleration. You have to try it out yourself, if you are comfortable with what I have taught you than its OK.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	just take them out before you go to sleep every night.    You're right about them getting worse. I used to sleep in my contacts and they eventually got worse.
nEVoabeSaa	No! Flexibility has to be worked on, a lot of stretching. Core strength has to be worked on and combine both when you relax the flexibility will click in, but when you are tense, the strength will click in. Best of Luck
oP3VVW5raa	Is there a history of varicose veins in your family ?    Varicose veins are when the veins (possibly in this case in your legs; it can occur elsewhere - haemorrhoid's for example) are weakened and not able to cope with returning blood back to the heart as efficiently as before so the blood pools in weak spots.  These weak spots in the veins then bulge out.  Some can be seen through the skin but often varicose veins are the veins that more deeply set in the muscles of the leg.    It is possible you have these sneaky varicose veins.  I started getting mine at twenty in both legs; they looked like a map of streets in a busy CBD.  I have had them treated twice with sclerosing injections by the time I was 30.    Bruising will occur and disappear quickly when younger as we something called phagocytes in our white blood cells that love to clean up mess.    You are lucky - your phagocytes work very efficiently.    Keep them working efficiently by eating buckwheat, oranges in fact all citrus fruits contain this nutrient known as Rutin.    Rutin is a relative of Vitamin C and it helps to strengthen capillaries and prevent sore legs, bruising and varicose veins.|`|abae6afaf05cd4433e382fc342911d20aa	Anyone can come on here regardless of experience or training and give you an answer that may or may not be correct! Going to the doctor is the best answer.
rLsphyqhaa	It might shorten the time you have or in fact come down with a cold/flu. it is pretty much a high dose of Vitamin C to which a person can get plenty of by eating right drinking plenty of fluids water and juice. Dressing for the cold not getting over heated all sweaty and then going out in the cold. Most times a person is coming down with a cold or flu anyway it is already in there system for about seven to 10 days before you really feel the stuff. It is not saying your brother didn't bring home a germ or something a few days ago it is that you are now just coming down with the symptoms. I have noticed each year when our kids were small we pretty much had them over just about all the colds until school began, then it all started up again each and every year. They were around a bunch of others that have been on  vacation to which were exposed to things and over time the bactria gets into the body and you get sick. And it happens mostly during the winter months, and during the spring when all the pollen is in the air.
tXTB8inJaa	see if any of your friends want to go. a lot of guys go to the gym, and would go more often if they had someone to go with.  to not feel weird, simply listen o your ipod and go into your own world, no one is watching you so you shouldn't worry lol. as for machines you dont know how to use, figure the name out and go look on the internet, that's what i would do.|`|VTHscx1aaa	Seriously, if you don't know how to use machines, ask one of the trainers that are there, it's what they're there for! :) They should also be able to spot you on things such as the bench press where you will need it. Don't be afraid to ask the trainers for help, however, it's a bit rude to ask the normal gym goers for their assistance or advice as they are there to do a workout, and someone coming up and asking questions or asking you to show them things can really make you lose your focus and ruin your rests, etc.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Go to AOL Search - type in - Scott H.

Though, when I go to the gym with someone I do feel better. And I'm guessing ur not extremely buff or ripped cus then ppl wouldn't being staring at u "weird."

mh0QRDE9aa	I could not agree with you more.  The people on this forum have no clue as to how their bodies work or how to maintain them.  Most of this is taught in elementary school and we all had to go there.  Everyone thinks there is a magic pill to lose weight.  They forget they are the ones who put the weight on in the first place and there was no magic pill do that. But now they want a quick fix.  Absolutely, no common sense.  I think they like to embarrass themselves in asking this type of question besides showing their ignorance.|`|cb2NxPERaa	If people stopped asking that then I'd never get any points on Y! A.

There are many young people who ask questions about dieting. This is why people are still asking that same question, " How to Loose Weight." They are new to what is common chatter to you and me.     " EAT LESS AND MOVE MORE" is not " the dieting secret to end all dieting secrets." If a person eats less and moves more, that would increase their appetite and cause them to eat more.   In order to loose weight, ie , burn fat, you need a combination of a healthy diet and exercise.     Stating "if you are eating clean foods and burning calories, you get thinner. THAT'S IT." is an invaluable commet. If you were to do this, there would be an enormous strain on the body and mind; fatigue, mood swings, a depletion of B 12, headaches, nausea and dehydration.|`|pywffiyLaa	Because eating less and moving more is difficult, and people want something easy. Think about how much money people waste on supplements that don't work chasing the dream of doing it the easy way.

CZ1nO9C9aa	The government grows some in Mississippi.  Actually, 12 people in the U.S. can smoke weed legally anytime, anywhere, under any jurisdiction.  There was a government program for medical weed in the 80s, but it got shut down very quickly ... only 12 people got to keep their right.      There are medical marijuana places that grow it, like that other guy said, mostly in California.     In Oregon you can grow it yourself if you have a medical license to do so.|`|exMPHWKHaa	They grow it with medical marijuana licensees most likely in California.|`|clOf0PDRaa	licensed growers grow it.  it is grown also by the government.|`|L1qVELDsaa	Hooray oxford (U of Miss).

4B9Ve1LSaa	First of all I would like to say how truly sorry I am that a young person like yourself has to deal with this mental and emotional abuse on a regular basis.  It is not right of her in any way shape or form, and having depression is not a valid excuse for her to treat anyone so horribly.  Unfortunately you are in a situation in which there is somewhat of a role reversal.  Your mother is not nurturing or caring and instead acts like an out of control child who throws tantrums.  This leaves you to try and sort out the mess and make reason out of the unreasonable.  it really sounds as though your mother has a little more than just depression going on, but that is not your problem to solve.  It is her own and if I were you I wouldn't be holding my breath.  It is amazing that you have turned out as articulate as you sound growing up with such a mess.  The term perfect teen is somewhat of an oxymoron.  I certainly wasn't one and have yet to meet one.  Life in general, especially at your age is very difficult let alone when you are constantly being berated by your own mother.  Unfortunately dear, I do not think she will ever change.  Whatever ailment she wants to hide behind, she is still what she is.  Mean, bitter, jealous, obnoxious and degrading.  None of those are a symptom of depression, they are chosen behaviors.  If there is anyway that you could live with your father or another family member, I really would consider it if I were you.  You do not deserve to be treated this way no one does.  Good luck to you.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	I to am a depressed mom, and this makes me so say, maybe u should ask to go live with ur Dad for a while, Just until ur mom can get it together, her meds don't sound like there working, an adult has to tell her this, like ur Dad, I don't think any mom wants to treat their child like that, it's a form of verbal abuse. Get ur Dad in on this, u shouldn't have to live like that. It will certainly start to effect you to. Best of Luck to you.|`|hYohgOcAaa	ur mom has a problem ur obviously doing all the right things to helping her, the only thing u can do now is be close with ur dad, siblings, or friends. it can help to talk to them. now that ur mom has a problem try not to take things to seriously cuz probably she dosent mean them, ur mom is ill and its not ur fault. i understand that it hurts but u have to put those words behind u and move on because u cant do anything about that. shes not trying to bring you down and u need to be understanding and try ot to hold grudges|`|SG27rfSdaa	Hi,  I wonder if you could live with your father who apparently cares for you and your stepmom.    As for getting your Mom to admit anything or say anything nice it appears she is not capapble to do so, this is nothing to do with you, you seem very brave to have come this far and talk inteligently about this. Kudos to you :-)    Forgiveness is hard but if you could get away from your Mom that would be the best thing I think. I hope you can.  good luck and God bless.

MCKTvF0uaa	The very use of the term "bipolar" is being overdone much these days--by the media, in written pieces, here on line. Indeed, so much so that I feel that the average person out there (and even some doctors) can't really define it all that well. I was educated learning the definition of "mood swings" -- sometimes inexplicable rises and falls within a day for no apparent reason. And having had epilepsy for nearly 35 years, I can say loudly that these ups and downs are part and parcel of this neurological malfunction. If you fear such a thing, don't be afraid of asking an appropriate doctor for both a definition of it, and possible tests to show if you should see further help and/or medicine. Best of luck. Stay confident!|`|wdmp9eYXaa	just tell your doctor what you are experiencing (but please don't tell him/her what you think the diagnosis might be. they don't usually like that.) after telling your doctor what you have been experiencing let him/her decide what it sounds like to them and then let them decide what the next step is. then follow through with it whether you agree with their diagnosis or not. they will probably have you go see a psychiatrist for further diagnosing and follow up and possibly medications. believe me you don't want it to be bipo|`|R75tldc8aa	See a psychiatrist?

pvYy6iTSaa	Angel - YES, YOU CAN donate blood after visiting Canada and England.  The donor center has a list of countries excluded.  The main delays usually relate with visits in the past year to countries with malaria, such as African countries, India, Mexico, and parts of Asia.|`|STI2L7ojaa	You should be perfectly fine going to donate blood if you only went to England. According the Canadian Blood Services, the main risk with traveling abroad is malaria, and England is not on the list of malaria-risk zones. Someone else above mentioned sex.

Good for you for being a donor :)|`|4f321nOjaa	It all depends, how long you have left and \where you have gone. Sometimes you have to wait a certain amount of years.

Try it thought as your doctor or local blood drive.|`|wUAUKlKkaa	I think england should be OK - I am from england and there is no malaria here or anything bad.  You shouls have a look at the blood donate website. In the UK it takes you through step by step any questions and about any countries you have been.  Also when I went to give blood I couldn't cos I went to dominican republic - but after 6 months I was OK.  Just have a word with the nurse when you get there - they are usually very helpful|`|AA10798839	If you didn't have sex, then you should be able. Think it's only the sex part they are concerned about.
ArCVeBHyaa	yeah, they are for real lazy people. they read the ingredient labels on everything for you. crazy isn't it!|`|G3TEO6C7aa	Maybe they do, but if you're severely allergic to peanuts and go to eat a Milky Way bar, what are you gonna do, let the dog sniff it and get slobber all over it?? And then possibly eat it if the dog doesn't detect it (which is another risk because it could still be in there)
RXI8ImdIaa	Hypertonic would dry the sinuses by drawing water out of the tissue. Isotonic would simply get them wet on the outside, as a moisturizer.    I would recommend isotonic, unless your doctor has specifically told you otherwise. You don't want to dry out your sinuses, that leaves you open to infection.
sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to sleep better naturally".|`|bseGACNXaa	I go down the basement and do laundry.

RXI8ImdIaa	You should not use super glue on dental equipment. It is poisonous, and cannot be used on anything that goes in your mouth or touches food.      You should be able to find some temporary cements at a pharmacy, which are intended to be used in the mouth. These are only temporary though, and you need to go back to the dentist as soon as possible.|`|Td5t0S54aa	never do that stupid  u will land up only harming urself  consult a dentist instead        its a dentists advice

TC21ao0Paa	Generally, as a rule, you can treat your symptoms, even though you are taking an antibiotic. For example; if you are congested then, yes, you can take an over-the-counter medication for nasal and/or chest congestion. Mucinex-D is great but, on the expensive side. Ocean Mist Nasal Spray is over-the-counter and can relieve nasal congestion( the generic is just as good). Depending on what type of cough that you may have, there are over-the-cough suppressants ( which helps to quiet a cough). If you have a congested cough and are having a hard time in clearing the mucus, then you need a cough expectorant that allows you to be able to get rid of any mucus. Plus, either way, you should drink plenty of liquids, especially water. This will keep your body hydrated ( especially, if you have a fever). If you have a sore throat then you can take Motrin ( Ibuprofen = generic ), Advil or Alleve as these medications help with the pain plus reduce an inflammation or swelling.  Be sure to take with a glass of milk or food to reduce stomach upset. Read the label for dosage instructions.Tylenol can also help with the pain but, it will not help with reducing any swelling from a sore throat. Of course, there is DayQuil and NyQuil as well.    However, it is always best to ask your Doc first so he/she can be aware of any over-the-counter treatments that you are taking along with the antibiotic.    I hope that this helps and that you feel better soon.|`|rFmBtm3eaa	You should speak with the physician who prescribed the Amoxicillin and find out from them.

AN9PdKmgaa	my first thought is you may not be eating like you should which will lower your blood sugar and make you feel nauseous also you could be dehydrating which will have the same effect. It could also be you are under too much stress. If you cant get these symptoms under control you should see a medical doc.|`|WixVIsFtaa	talk to your dr.  it could all just be stress related.....or there could be something wrong because of your migranes.  just go and get it checked out just in case.
8cDWPlEpaa	I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma last month. They put me at stage 3S which means it is on both sides of my diaphragm and in my spleen. My treatment is 6 months of ABVD chemotherapy followed by about a month of radiation to shrink a large tumor in my chest.   I just started chemotherapy, my hair hasn't fallen out yet but it is a common side affect with ABVD chemo, however, I've heard of some people who don't lose their hair at all during treatment.  Luckily Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most treatable kinds of cancer and even in the late stages can be completely taken care of with the right treatment.   Because you are pregnant you probably won't start treatment until after your baby comes so he won't be affected by the chemo.   Things are going to be okay you just have to pace yourself and take it easy right now. I'm emotional too because I had to drop out of school and put myself behind at least a semester because of this, it's not fun but I think somehow you'll probably learn something from this experience and it will probably help you or someone you know in the future.   Good luck with everything and don't hesitate to contact me if you ever need any support.    It's also a great idea to get into contact with the American Cancer Society as soon as possible because they can direct you to cancer survivors who can be a huge emotional support.    Update:  My hair started falling out in clumps last night, my nurse told me that it usually falls out at about the 18th day. The medicine that causes this is Adriamycin, and usually people lose all of there body hair.|`|17orTrcRaa	There is a woman I know who had a different kind of cancer...breast cancer...while pregnant.  She went through chemotherapy and a double mastectomy while pregnant, and now has a beautiful healthy baby of a few months.  So I know it is possible to recieve treatment while pregnant and have a good outcome.      Hodgkins is better than breast cancer as far as cure rates, the chemo isn't too strong, and your oncologist will be able to tell you what's going to work.    My son was diagnosed last month, and had his 2nd chemo last week.  His hair started falling out after the 2nd chemo, so he shaved it.  Not an option for you, but it is only temporary.|`|cOA5H89aaa	I'm 18 years old and was diagnosed with Lymphoma and told on New years eve. I'm about stage 3, it's in my neck, chest, and spleen. My treatment is going to last for 6 months, having two doses pair month. The type of medication I'm going to have is called ABVD. The doctors say it may not be necessary to have radiation therapy, in fact unlikely, but if I do have to have it, it comes after the chemo treatments are finished. I can't tell you anything else other than I'm defiantly going to lose my hair but I have over 90% chance, which is really spectacular. I'm starting chemo tomorrow actually, and if it would help I could tell you how it went, but only if you want me to.     Don't worry, everything will be fine and I'm not just saying that. I knows that I'm going to be ok and it sounds as if mine is a bit more serious than yours as it spread farther.     All the best to you and your baby! Good luck!|`|afJz77pjaa	I was diagnosed back in January 2008. I was stage 4B Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I had pelvic, spinal marrow and lung involvement. I had 8 rounds of ABVD chemotherapy and no radiation. Hair loss is common with this chemo, but it's pretty common with others as well.     Well, you're pretty far along with the baby and it does sound like you may be in an early stage with the HD. Hopefully the doctors will let you carry full term.    Here is a forum I wish I would've found when I was first diagnosed. I know there are a couple women on there that got diagnosed while pregnant.     http://forums.webmagic.com/ubbthreads/po...|`|AxvG9B3waa	If you will check my profile and email me, I'll send you an article outlining our approach to treatment of HD in pregnancy. Be reassured to know that outcomes for you are not affected by the pregnancy; better yet, outcomes in your child are usually very good when treatment is given in the final trimester. In fact, there have been remarkably few bad outcomes even when patients were treated in first trimester.  If you can wait till delivery for treatment, then all the better. You have an overall excellent prognosis with this disease if it is truly limited to your neck.    Blessings

bwpz11iaaa	In medicine, a nebulizer is a device used to administer medication to people in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. It is commonly used in treating cystic fibrosis, asthma, and other respiratory diseases.    There are different types of nebulizer, although the most common are the jet nebulizers, which are also called "atomizers". Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a compressed air source that causes air or oxygen to blast at high velocity through a liquid medicine to turn it into an aerosol, which is then inhaled by the patient.|`|xYTagSIyaa	A nebulizer a a machine that uses compressed air to deliver asthma medicine as a wet aerosol, a mist that can be inhaled.  It is good for people who are having difficulty using inhalers, and those with severe asthma.  It can also be used for emphysema.  The most common medications used in a nebulizer are bronchodilators which open up the air passages and inhaled steroids, which helps stabilized the airways from spasms due to allergies.|`|00A3BfSEaa	it helps you breath.|`|hRYvWdUFaa	not sure why???|`|j1xB9LmDaa	eats poop and neutralizes the carbon from the crap to oxygen|`|okH04Nhlaa	it nebulizes things|`|fmvcEqEyaa	It's a breathing machine for people who have to do breathing treatments.  You put medicine into the mouthpiece, and it makes smoke so that you can inhale the medicine.  Some have pipe-looking mouth pieces, and some have masks that you wear on your face.|`|9IDDxwoaaa	It blows out air into the medicine tube so the medicine can be inhaled by whome ever needs it.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	It is used to get medicine into lungs. Worn like a mask each treatment lasts abut 15 minutes. I used it to treat asthma. being able ot breathe isn't optional. I would have an attack and rush to the doctors or the ER if the doctor wasn't open Finally he prescribed a nebulizer so I had it at home and could treat myself.

AA10703176	I would assume so because I take Prevacid and I have taken antibiotics along with them. No warning from my doctor so I assume it is safe. DO NOT eat raw seafood when on Prilosec or anything else like that though. It limits the acids we need to kill bacteria in the seafood and can cause you serious harm.
UECCsRKvaa	It could be an allergy, I had bronchitis once and it was bad. Everyone was sick in my family with the flu, and shortly after that I got bronchitis. So it's very possible another classmate could have given it to you.|`|gLEODIVdaa	not pioson, maybe something in it that could trigger that. you should talk to your teacher to see what was in it|`|xj5dMwnhaa	You may have been allergic to something in the tea. Give it a week or so. If it goes away, it was probably just an allergy.    Just so you know, if you never informed the teacher of your allergy, you can't blame him/her for your sickness.    Also, check to see if your other classmates who drank the tea (if there were any) have the same thing you have. If so, you may want to have a talk with your teacher.|`|8OSdPa5iaa	Its a coincidence. i don't think there is a reason that a teacher would want to hurt you.|`|WPFMVtzOaa	No bronchisit is a viral or bacterial infection you inhale , you can not get it from drinking. so you got the infection from somebody around you may be in school or even in the street
jsS03HSNaa	Don't become self-destructive.  It's not worth it.  High school isn't for everyone, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Zipping your sweatshirt up all the way is only letting your peers know that they have won.  There is so much more to you then being a band geek, I'm sure.  You're smart, just think of all the people you could help.  And in the end, will it matter if you got all the guys in high school?  Someday, those guys will be flipping your burgers and that girl will mop your floor.  Don't change your personality, you're fine the way you are.    You really need to talk to someone, someone that won't laugh.  A parent, relative, counselor, even a trusted teacher.  And since you like music, write your own lyrics as a way to let out your feelings.  I also suggest you keep a journal.  You've already taken the first step, because it takes a lot of courage to ask for help.      Pretty has a lot of meanings.  I'm sure you look just fine, but that doesn't mean you have to have blonde hair and a size zero waist.  Pretty means that you can smile, make people feel better, and are never afraid to extend an open hand.  That will get you so much further then nice eyes.      Take out a piece of paper and write down five things you like about your appearance.  Maybe it's that you tan well in the summer, or you always get compliments on your dimples when you smile.  Then, write five things about your personality that you like.  Last, write down five things you want to accomplish before your thirty.  Skydiving, touring Europe- be creative.  Now, tape that inside a notebook or journal, and whenver you are feeling down, take a look at it.    And most important, know that you are never alone.  We all feel like outsiders sometimes, and that's okay.  Just know that you are not the only one who feels this way, and if you look hard enough, there are always going to be someone who is willing to help you when you are down and there will always be someone who may have been down for the longest time but you are the only one who can help them.  I promise, though, everything will work out.  And, don't dumb yourself down to try to be accepted.  The people who make fun of your smarts are just jealous.|`|R51zXdvHaa	sounds like all the people in your school are jerks! just try not to let it get to you. dont let it seem like it bothers you. act confident. stick up for yourself. please dont do suicide. remember its not you, its those people that are the problem. maybe you can transfer to another school.  hope i can help.|`|bcflMMJEaa	First and foremost, be YOURSELF, don't waste another moment trying to be what everyone else thinks is the cool way to be. You're only going to find yourself more lost and confused by doing this.   I know how hard high school is, it was murder for me, but I promise you when it's over, if you let yourself let go of it, in 4-5 years you wont even remember their names and you can laugh at the experience. It's not worth dying over, trust me. I once had a group of students write 'Cyclopes" on my locker because I had to wear an eye patch for a few months.   Play your music, study hard, ignore the people who laugh at you, if you don't want to answer questions in class you don't have to but work hard on your homework and be proud of your own successes even if others don't recognize them.  As for the girl trying to steal your friend, try to think of things your friend loves to do and do them with her, make her feel really special by taking her to places she loves or watching her favorite movies with her.  Don't give!

abBCyJhFaa	I am 14 now and I got my contacts when I was 13. All ur suppst to do is wear/ have ur glasses for like a month. I hated my glasses too and I still do! If I don't have anymore contacts left and I have to go to school I eaither skip it or go like blind. Lol. So yea all u have to do is say that there are alot of kids ur age that wear contacts and u don't like glasses.   But if u do get them make sure u take good care of them because they are expensive and can scratch ur eyes.     Good luck and hope u can get them. They are amazing! :D|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I guess they don't advise you to use contact at 13, think that you aren't old enough to take care of it and in the end having more problems than before. Whereas, glasses would be simpler, just put them on and off you go. Contact is a lot convenient. They don't fall out of your eyes, nor they affect your outdoor activities and others don't know that you are short-sighted. Why didn't you ask that lady the reasons for not allowing you to have contact lens?|`|fe1d07deddd798cef8cc34a48d842115aa	I've had contacts since I was 14. Some lady at Walmart can't tell you what you can and cannot buy. If your mother says you can have contacts, then you can have contacts. They are considered cosmetic so many insurance companies do not pay for them, but once you get a prescription, you can buy them from VisionDirect.com cheaper than most retailers, including Walmart.    Although, your eyesight is not that bad, but they still make contacts in your prescription.|`|d2ELmoIdaa	if the glasses bother you get contacts ;  easy as that .|`|hNHaNPeuaa	You know you might think your situation is bad try my situation. I've had glasses since i was in grade 4 and I just got contacts a month ago and i'm almost 17 and my mom would never let me get the dumb things and i'm in so many sports. I can't tell you how many times we would have to go into the eye place to get my glasses fixed cuz i got bumped or hit or a ball in the face. Not wearing them during sports was not an option because my vision is -4 in one eye and -4.25 in the other. So you see you don't have it that bad and by the way i'm always been very responsible so there you go.
Pmb0MeB8aa	The type of wound would dictate the type of dressing needing. Once it starts going necrotic (turning black) a wet-to-dry dressing with sterile saline is typically prescribed for wound debridement---when you peel the dressing off, it takes with it some of the dead tissue. Agressive IV antibiotic therapy is also common. Amputation often occurs as a last resort (but happens quite often).    The reason their wounds take so long to heal is 3 fold. After being diabetic for a long time, the high sugar level of the blood causes damage to the blood vessels, especially in the extremities. Eventually, blood flow to the area is just not what it needs to be. Because the blood flow isn't as good, the damaged tissue doesn't get the oxygen, nutrients, and immune system help that it needs to fight the infection.    Another factor that contributes is that high blood sugar kills nerve cells, leading to diabetic neuopathy--eventually, they have little to no sensation in their extremities. So many times they may get a small cut/blister on their feet, but not feel it or notice it, so it just gets bigger and bigger and gets infected before they notice it is there.    The other reason is because bacteria grows in sugar rich environments. Bacteria use sugar as food just like we do. People with a high blood sugar harbor more bacteria for infection, and the infection is harder to fight because of the adequate food supply.    The best bet for a diabetic to to monitor their sugar regularly, keep it under control, diet and exercise. Also, special care must be taken with the feet. Special diabetic socks should be worn to prevent blisters, and extreme care should be taken when clipping toe nails, etc. The feet should be inspected regularly for wounds or signs of infection.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I could not answer any better than Be More did. However, I can possibly help you with something that has helped my husband.  For years he had leg ulcer problems, due to bad circulatory problems in the legs, even before he was a diabetic. Once they get extremely big and deep it takes a long time to heal.  When I started to go through pre-menopause, I started to use natural progesterone cream.  I was reading up on it one day, and the article said that you can use it on open wounds and it will help close them, especially if caught early.  My husband got an open wound on his leg, we put just a small amount of the pro cream on the wound, a couple of times and it closed up.|`|mX27tszPaa	I agree, basically Be More's answer is the best and most complete.  I've had many relatives that had diabetes and they never watched their sugar like they should have and it really led to a deterioriation in their overall health, so make sure that you take care of it. Your feet are really  important to take care of too if you are diabetic and often times you need special shoes.  Sometimes they are hard to find as well, so I put a link below on how to do that in case you were wondering.     http://www.ehow.com/how_4751650_cheap-di...    Good Luck!!

And it sounds to me like you're not getting enough deep sleep (REM sleep) during the week. For the under eye circles as a quick fix, go to the pharmacy or grocery store and buy some under eye concealer. It looks like a beige or light green tube of lip stick. Wipe some under your eyes and dab it with your finger. Ta da! Bye bye dark circles! Other than that, for the long term, maybe go to bed earlier. Or are you scared of something when you sleep? Maybe your fear is keeping you in a lighter more alert stage of sleep. Or maybe you're thinking when you go to sleep? If you can figure out what's keeping you in a lighter state of sleep and solve the problem, the dark circles will go away on their own.

It takes 14-16 hours for something to pass through your body.  If he's throwing up then he needs to get to a doctor right away, that's a serious issue.  I would tell him to talk to a doctor.    He should cut out dairy for at least a week and see if that helps, if not he's not lactose intolorent.    -Connor

The worst thing you can do is search the internet about MS with your symptoms. It may even get you worried and worked up for no reason. I am 23 years old and have been diagnosed for over a year now.    MS is not something you can diagnose with symptoms alone. In order to have an accurate diagnoses you would need to be put through more tests rather than just an MRI. The doctors will make sure it isn't something else. MS symptoms often mirror symptoms of other diseases/conditions. They would do blood tests (to mark other things out), MRI's (maybe more than just one), brain nerve conduction tests, and even a spinal tap.     I personally haven't had pain like you are describing. My main issues come from numbness and the pins and needles feeling. Not to mention headaches and dizziness.    For someone to say that MS is a curse is ridiculous.  It is an ailment that many people have, and is adequately managed with the many different therapies available today.    If you have any more questions feel free to e mail me at kelyce522@yahoo.com. Good Luck in searching for your diagnoses.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	If you are convinced you have MS, then it would be worth your peace of mind to present your conclusion to your doctor who will almost certainly dismiss this.  And if by some stroke of cursed luck you do have it....good luck.|`|AA11048920	I am sorry that you are going through this. It is so frustrating waiting for a diagnosis but they take time. I know it is impossible  not to worry so in the mean time, try to keep busy. Multiple Sclerosis mimics about 40 other diseases and conditions. As a consequence it cannot be diagnosed by symptoms. In order to be diagnosed, neurologists have to take  MRIs of your brain spaced three months apart. If they find a specific type of lesion in more than one place in your brain each time, then they can definitively declare that you have MS. In all probability, there is a reason why they have chosen to take an MRI of your neck.   I am not a doctor but I suspect that they think that there might be some kind  of compression in the bones of your neck. If they thought that you had MS, you would not be sent to a neurosurgeon. You would have been sent to a neurologist. Compression of the bones would account for the pain that you are describing. That condition is correctable. It can caused by caused by a genetic defect, wear and tear, or a simple malformation. Please don't focus on any particular disease or condition. Chances are you are going to be wrong. Be your own best friend and let the doctors solve the problem.  I have had MS for 20 years now. What makes you think that you have it? What other symptoms do you have? MS symptoms initially usually come and go every few hours in the initial stages of the disease.|`|9e0b0af2d9cc2cd634228c515cc50a4faa	Hi cloud,   you have gotten a couple of great answers here..I know from experience that the hardest part of MS is the diagnosis period.  Once I got my diagnosis, there was a period of adjustment and I did have to tell myself it was time to pull up my big girl panties and get on with life. and you know something?? MS just isn't that bad. About 80% of us lead very normal lives.The odds are if you have MS, you will too.   I also tend to believe that you probably have a compressed disc and not MS..I have a compressed disc as well ( also at the base of my neck) and think your symptoms sound more like those than the MS.  I know telling you not to worry wont do much good, but try to at least stay positive.Both the possibilities are very treatable and you should be ok in no time !
zNPGaZRHaa	Girls dont care, besides 6 inches isnt that big either.|`|1rJmXjrhaa	who cares.  be confident about what you have, and no one will notice what size it is  besides dont you want a girl who hasnt seen many (if any) other men's private parts.|`|RlxzbfAGaa	4 inches is below average, but you still have about three to five years of growth still.  You may be a late bloomer in that area, you never know.  But I don't think it really matters, as a girl.   1.)  You love the guy for the guy, not the penis.  2.)  The vaginal canal is only about 3'' inches deep, you have plenty to stimulate with if you were to have sexual relations.  3.)  They should know you are still growing, and should leave you be.        Don't worry too much about it.|`|NICEuXYgaa	My boyfriend is about your size and he is older than you.  Even if you don't grow anymore you will be fine.  You just need to know how to use it.  If you are having sex, a good position is her on her back with her knees up by her ears.  Trust me it will make you feel like a superhero to her!|`|3UE3a1cKaa	noo thats not small well its not  big  but i whent out with a  guy that  was 2  sooo  it doesnt really  matter that  much and  6 inches  isnt that  big|`|B8e8x60Saa	4-6 inchs is the size.. its a fact.. some people might extend with pumps (but that not safe..if you make the tower taller you might jus break it OUCH)|`|SHEhwsUaaa	that don't really bother me! its not size that matters, but what you do with it!LOL yeah you should keep growing though. we can talk sometime if you want, i am 15!LOL|`|dygdgVlPaa	hel*l no!! lol i dont care i think girls that are specific about size idk its stupid lol but for me ur totally fine!! lol dont worry about those girls ur fiine! lol  that peace baby girl is right its wat u do with it size doesnt matter at all lol|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	It doesn't matter, hon, I'm sure you're better than fine. You might find some of this useful    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis...|`|ZkuYBUByaa	Wow! Sounds pretty small to me.  :(|`|MXRXG62oaa	Listen, the average vagina is 3-5 inches in length. Therefore, you will be able to fit all the way in. You will also be able to fit all the way in the mouth for oral, and how many guys can brag about that?  Im 18, my bf is 20. His is 4.5 inches. I love it. I would not want it bigger. I would rather have it be an inch smaller than an inch bigger. Why? because size DOES matter. Little is best.  And your not even that small. Most guys lie about their size

n0dbwJnmaa	Sounds like you have a cyst..or maybe one of the glands or nodes is swollen, can swell up and stay swollen for years, my dad has had a swollen gland on his neck since he was 19, he is nearly 40 now, so yeah, doesn't sound serious to me, if you are worried its cancerous, it isn't, cancerous lumps have no pain or discomfort, i'd just get it checked out but i'm sure you're fine, hope this helps.|`|c5IAMRbvaa	I agree with above: it could be a cyst, which is harmless to your body (in most cases). can you grab at the lump and pick it up (as in can you grab the skin around the lump and pick it up)? In that case, it is most likely a cyst, which can be easily removed if you go to a dermatologist.
AA10718475	14 up. plus consent.|`|ycNt74yyaa	AT LEAST 14 YEARS OLD IT'S THE LAW|`|cB2VGhLgaa	If your parents consent, you can get plastic surgery at any age.  However, with rihnoplasty, the surgeon may object due to your age if you are not fully grown.   By age 15 or 16 you should be old enough to get one.
nksewi03aa	Classic symptoms of conjunctivitis, but a optometrist or ophthalmologist would need to look at it to say with 100% certainty. You're going to need to go anyways because this is likely an infection and without medicine, it is only going to get a lot more painful, and a lot uglier looking.    It was likely caused by old, or dirty, or scratched contact lenses. Do not use them again until a doctor says its ok to, or you will make things much worse.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Are you sure you were wearing the lens not inside out. If so, the rough curled-up edges are cutting your eye lid. Or your lens maybe too small and didn't fit the curvature of your eye ball. Or even the lens has small minute particle or eye lash sticking to it. There maybe nothing wrong with your eyes, but the lens. For your info, I am a contact lens wearer for some 20 years without any complain.
Vk7kkrcLaa	I wouldn't call it common. it is rare, but completely normal.
P544Sbmqaa	They actually use chloraprep as their first choice.  I forget the ratio, but its alcohol and chlorahexadin, no betadine is used with the chloraprep.  I am allergic to the chlorohexadin.  Betadin/alcohol is the second choice, but I am also allergic to the betadine.  They actually use hydrogen peroxide on me.  It is probably the least favored method and is no where near as good as the other methods, and they have to clean it twice as much, but I am allergic to everything else.    As far as the iodine/betadine thing...  I have been told that if you are allergic to one it increases the chances of being allerigic to the other, so I have been cautioned that I may be allergic to iodine as well, but have never had a reaction.    Here is info about chloraprep  http://www.enturia.com/products/chloraPr...|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	This possibly varies depending on country or even state you are in.    Your best information will be from Dr or better still from nursing staff who will make sure you know the correct procedures.    If you have advised your Dr that you are sensitive to iodine, they won't use betadine.
FicyC2TXaa	Almost certainly not.    I'm guessing from your Q&A that you're a teenager; forgive me if I'm wrong.    As a male teen your chances of having breast cancer are just about zero.     Men do get breast cancer, but fewer than 1% of those diagnosed with breast cancer are male.    80% of all people diagnosed with breast cancer are over 50 (and most men diagnosed with it are over 60). It's rare in women under 40 (about 5% of those diagnosed), only 0.1% of those diagnosed are under 30 and it's almost unheard of in under 25s.    So you can see how very unlikely it would be for a teenage male to have breast cancer    Most breast lumps in men are actually a condition called gynaecomastia, a button-like growth under the nipple and areola area that can be felt and is sometimes visible to the naked eye and occasionally it can be quite tender.    This increase in the amount of breast tissue is not a tumour and occurs due to changes in hormone balances at times like adolescence - your age in other words.    This is very likely what you have, but see your doctor for reassurance|`|TqBpKMbcaa	Hi Mike- you really need to see a doctor to make sure, but it could just be a cyst. Cysts are harmless round little sacs filled with fluid that are benign and are often times found in the breasts of men and women. You really, really need to go to your doctor to make sure that is what it is. Also, please do not use antiperspirant. The aluminum in it keeps you from eliminating toxins that can back up into your breast area. Use it only when you absolutely need to. Try to get away with just deordant, if you can.|`|64d4c4ebdda5b5b37d2d373eda33ef42aa	You have to go to your doctor to find out. I'm not trying to scare you or anything, but it's a possibility. So, I suggest you go to the doctor ASAP.

AA11727191	I would go to the doctors and flat out request a test for diabetes. Or at least ask them if they tested for diabetes. If they did then you are fine if not then you should get tested! Good Luck...ps I have no idea why that person feels they need to be rude to everyone being concerned about having diabetes. That is what this website is for...not to be rude to people who have questions. Good Luck!|`|VYtlFDpxaa	You should go to the doctor to get your blood tested with a finger prick. The going to the bathroom a lot and drinking a lot of water are what I had before I was diagnosed. The day I was diagnosed I felt like I had the flu and I couldn't drink or eat anything without throwing up. Sprite was the only thing that made me feel better. I went to urgent care and my blood sugar was over 800, then I was sent to the emergency room.     So I suggest that you check your blood sugar to see if you have diabetes, before it gets worse =) good luck!|`|kUfiQkgdaa	In think you might have diabetes but if they haven't figured out what's going on then it might still be developing that your there could be something not right with your heart.|`|RGRmNR3kaa	I know diabetes seems like the latest fad but it's not as fun as you think.  If you are having these symptoms and you went to the doctor, they undoubtedly checked for diabetes.  They would have done that first before going to the CAT scan, ultrasound, and stress test.  You are most likely fine and going through the typical teenage angst.  Have you spoken to a therapist about your issues?    If you received a sugary drink before your test, they would have tried again the next day.  Also, you don't have to be fasting to run a C-Peptide of HbA1c test which would have ruled out diabetes immediately.  Chances are, they ran these tests and they came out fine.
LvGQINd3aa	actually yes, you should take those pills...just remember not to overdose.  just because your body needs it, doesnt neccessarily mean your body can handle it.    also eat meats...the protein in them will help greatly..    stay healthy!
AA11535062	You posted under Diabetes, so I'm going out on a limb here and I will assume you are diabetic. With diabetes comes peripheral neuropathy, a medical term meaning nerve damage or death in your feet, legs, hands or arms. I do not know if this is your problem but, you said you just wanted thoughts. Sorry this one is so dark sounding. :( It is defiantly serious. Persons with advanced PN can not feel when they have hurt themselves on their feet (no pain, dead nerves). It is recommended that they check their feet with a mirror so they can see all aspects of them to make sure that they have not cut themselves without knowing it.|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	it depends on when it happens, like, does it happen after you do something like exercise or maybe after you get up for the first time after watching a long movie?     i dont know what's wrong, but it sounds like something that happens to me 2... except or the small pain part...    it should be nothing to worry about, maybe the muscles are *thinking* setting into place after you move them or something... idk...|`|rSwce38saa	I'm curious to know, how much exercise do you get?  This is a symptom of your legs starting to wear out. I'd definately recommend that you begin walking. Don't push it, but get your legs (and whole body in general) moving.    It's healthy!
3FXJtjq6aa	Don't do it.    Thats just giving them a reason to cut you up without you giving notice, and since you don't get anything out of it.. I suggest you die with all your organs ;)    last thing we need on this planet is more living people.|`|fpbRv3Otaa	-because doctors may not try as hard to save your life if they know you are an organ donor. Especially instances when the person is on life support.  -for people that want an open casket.. organ donors do not look as appealing.. and a dead body is already a morbid sight.  This is especially an issue when a child dies and the parents have an open casket and they see their child.. it just makes the process worse.    IM PRO ORGAN DONATION however you asked for the cons.. so there they are.   best answer? i neeed points|`|Wmn5Bh1Zaa	One major argument against that would be if you want to be frozen after you are dead.  Many people are doing this now, but it is expensive.  If you have hope in science to find a way to bring people back to life after they're dead, then I don't think you'd want to freeze yourself without all of your insides there.      Another reason not to might be because you may want your body to still be "complete" after you are dead, for religious or spiritual reasons, etc.|`|iCXt7FfEaa	i treat my body as sacred therefore when i died, i don't want anyone to take any part of it. and i'm not sure if could really rest in peace when one of my organs is living in someone else' body because i believe resting in peace means every part of you including your internal organs.|`|jrc7V1Gqaa	Victoria   First thing I would bring into the debate would be religion their are some that do not dismember the body. The next would be the Hepatitis issue so many people have it and do not know it the contaminated organ could possible pass the disease on. These would be the first few things I would bring up. As a side note I am an organ donor. Good Luck in the debate|`|8XigtCWGaa	I am an organ donor. I have hepatitis B core antibodies. Which means I must have been exposed to it at one time. I have never been sick but I think I might have caught it when I worked on the hepatitis floor of the hospital when I was an aide. I asked and they said it wouldn't effect my ability to donate organs. So far, I can't donate blood though.|`|1WlPdFdVaa	I'm drawing a blank.|`|oUFZPljBaa	I heard that if you sign up to donate your organs that you will die first and they won't make as much effort to save your life.

It also sounds like if she can tell her child that she's going to die (it sounds like you're young, so I'm assuming your mom isn't like 100 years old) she probably needs some counseling. She might just be looking for attention.|`|y5EQiY1Paa	take to a counsler or a therapist about getting her help
UZxeBrxQaa	Frostbite is the cold version of a burn.  The tissue damage is similar and will take weeks, perhaps months to fully exfoliate and resolve.  If the skin was frozen deeply, it will have to be replaced by new skin or scar tissue and that will take some time.    Discoloration is not unusual.  However, pain, pus, swelling, burning sensation at this late date should be looked into by a physician.|`|o2sgh1fVaa	Usually you don't get frostbite that fast in that temp, but here are some tips that should help.  - Wrap the area up with many pieces of clothing  - If you soak it in water make sure it's less than 105 F and don't  touch the side of the container or whatever you put the inflicted area in.  - Remember it's fragile so don't try hurting it or touching it much.|`|aCx57XXzaa	Stanley go see a doctor! you can get frostbite in minutes.    Frostbite occurs when body tissue or skin is exposed to freezing temperatures. This can happen over a short or prolonged period of time depending on the temperature and wind chill. The nose, ears, fingers, toes, cheeks and chin are often the most susceptible to the freezing cold weather.  Frostbite Symptoms   Redness or pain in any skin area.  A feeling of pins and needles, followed by numbness.  A white or grayish yellow skin color.  The skin could be hard, pale, cold or have no feeling.  Severe frostbite could appear very white and numb, this could indicate that the tissue has started to freeze. !  Very severe frostbite can cause blisters, blackened skin or dead tissue (gangrene). Seek medical attention immediately!  Frostbite Treatment   If possible move the victim to a warm place.  The victim should avoid walking if they have frostbitten feet or toes.  Remove any wet clothing or constricting jewelry.  Wrap the affected area with sterile dressing, separating affected fingers and toes and get the victim to medical assistance immediately.If you can not get immediate medical attention, then the affected area should be immersed in warm (not hot) water. The water temperature should not be more than 104 degrees or should be comfortable to the touch.  If the affected area is ears, nose or cheeks, use warm cloths and apply for 20 to 30 minutes keeping the cloths warm.  If warm water is not available, the affected area can be warmed using body heat. Frostbitten fingers can be heated by placing in the armpit.  During the warming process, severe swelling, burning pain and skin color changes may occur. When the skin is soft and sensation returns, the warming process is completed.  The frostbitten area should not be rubbed using snow or massage. This can cause further damage.  Do not use direct heat from a stove, heating pad, heat lamp, fireplace or other similar heat source. This may increase the chances of burning the victims affected area.

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, I mean this to be taken in the best sense of course,     But, you've heard the phrase 'everyone loves an idiot' - and well, you're obviously not an idiot, or thick or slow or any of those things judging from the clarity of your written communication and your awareness of people's perception, but some people just look a tad dopey or maybe you're all in your own world either way...here's my take on it.     When someone is perceived to be 'simple' as you put it - they're really harmless, a bit dopey, and the things they do and say are 'cute' and usually in kickboxing especially, you learn to stay on your guard all the time even in your regular life, but around someone who seems so harmless and simple, you can't conceive any malicious intent and think of them as really a joy to be around because you can be relaxed and just shrug and laugh.     You probably have some eccentricities or traits that others just find cute on you, and amusing in a good way because you seem to nice of nature for anyone to be 'laughing at you' - so, all in all, I reckon its a good thing that you put people at ease and so - you're a good un'.|`|ixHwF4apaa	may be true

ROAS5EGLaa	A good rule of thumb is 2 pounds a week. Therefore your almonst only losing fat. Most people think there diet is amazing after losing 10 pounds in a week, but its very common. Due to the lack of carbs one can drop 5-10 pounds of water in the first week. If you exercise 30 minutes a day everyday you could lose about 8-10 pounds. If you havn't lost any weight after a week, cut 200-300 calories from your diet a day. No one can tell what reacts better to your body than you, so you be the judge of how much you eat. If you feel sluggish eat more carbs, but from healthy sources such as fruits, veggies, oatmeal, brown rice. Good LUCK!|`|WN6tWLdYaa	lets say you exercise 3 x week and burn 300 cals each time which is about 30 minutes of exercise those three days. & lets say you eat a 1500 cal diet. you would lose around 10 pounds in a month. maybe even 15|`|IeOeYOJ3aa	If you don't starve yourself or exercise too much, then you could lose from 4 to 10 pounds in a month.|`|K4SOAACTaa	U can lose up to 60 pounds in 30 dayz by starving urself by eating three reall small meals but since u wanna d0 it tha healthy way, I heard dat if u want t0 d0 it da healthy way u lose one or two pounds a week.

Just be a normal freaking person !|`|CVsoh7lUaa	The best way to loose weight fast is by choosing the right foods.  FOOD is more powerful than any prescription weight loss pills, because the FOOD that you eat can either make you THIN or FAT.   You don't get fat because of a lack of exercising, that's a myth.  You get fat because you don't eat the right foods at the right intervals each day.    To optimize metabolism, energy, and mental and emotional positivity, set a goal to eat five or six small meals per day  do NOT skip meals. Sometimes you will feel like you dont have the time or the energy to put anything together, but this is critical to your success. Your body and your metabolism are designed to look for cues telling them when to burn and when to conserve. If you miss a meal your body does what it is programmed to do  stop burning. Ideally, the five meals include breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack and dinner. On occasion, you may also enjoy a healthy and delicious fat-burning dessert after dinner. This five meal ideal will keep your metabolism burning brightly, and your brain will enjoy a steady source of fuel, keeping you mentally sharp and safe from those challenging blood sugar drops that spur cravings for sub-par food choices.  So how much should you eat at each meal? Begin by keeping in mind that there is no one definition of a serving size. With both the Food Pyramid and Nutrition Facts labels, the serving size is simply a unit of measure and may not represent the amount you are really eating. For example, an English muffin represents two Food Pyramid servings of bread, despite the fact that the Nutrition Facts label on the package defines a serving as one muffin.  I learned the majority of this information at the website listed below.
sRkIZrEbaa	ok so.  basically you didnt eat a lot.  i eat wayyyy more.  And by drinking water you are making your body digest your food more easily which is great!  yogurts are also good.  maybe if you would add a bit of excercise you would feel lighter.  and you probaly feel "fat" because of the water you are drinking which makes you full.  I have an oppsite problem. im trying to gain weight. hehe.  but i think you didnt eat a lot.  and no i dont think you can get fat if you eat a lot in one day.  trust me i have tried it.|`|frAh6cgDaa	it depends on what you ate. if it was a taco, then was it organic/healthy?    it's better to have 5 mini-meals a day then to skip.    eat if you're hungry. if you're not, then don't eat.|`|YgDO6sxAaa	well what you ate doesn't have that much calories in it. what you ate is actually pretty healthy and you're not fat if that's what you thought. i'm 164 pounds and 5'3. two cookies isn't bad. and water is a healthy drink. you can't get fat by eating that. if you had McDonalds for breakfast lunch and dinner then you'd get fat in one day. :)|`|H8hLjDCLaa	Seems you did not have enough, plus your meals should be more balanced.  Did you have juice or and vitamins with your breakfast?  Did you have milk during lunch or dinner?  Did you have any fruits or vegatables with lunch or dinner?  Fruits also make a good desert, much better than cookies or sweets containing sugar.  Never skip meals, very bad idea.|`|J5xp6H8maa	i usully eat a lot more|`|ROAS5EGLaa	You cannot get fat in a day, but you can feel bloated, which is caused by and overload of carbs, because carbs hold water. Try a diet like this instead. Breakfast, eggwhites and a banana. Snack, a multigrain bar. Lunch, Chicken and veggies and cut out the cookies. Dinner cheese sandwhich with yogurt. You can also incorporate 20-45 minutes of cardio every day, ie walking, running, sports. If your working out and not losing weight after a week then cut back a little on food. I can't tell if you shold skip meals because I do not know if you workout or not. Hope this helps!|`|CMq78ueSaa	you didn't eat that much. You can't get really fat in one day, you might just gain like a pound. You eat the same amount i eat a day and you shouldn't skip meals, just exercise, like jog on the weekends or something.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	nope dont change anything except instead of two tacos eat just one. thats the only thing that screwed up your diet today. besides that it sounds just right to me. your not fat because you are at a good weight|`|hVICguqGaa	no it actually sounds like you didnt eat enough calories today. you cant get fat in one day. If you are concerned about weight you should work out but your height and weight sound healthy!|`|2WYV6qFBaa	to be honest, i don't think you ate a lot (in fact, it doesn't sound like much), but i do think that you need to eat more protein. it helps to keep you fuller longer than dairy and starches.    i would recommend eating more vegetables and drinking black tea. it helps clean out your colon where a LOT of old nasty stuff resides, and you don't have to feel guilty about it because it's good for you.    if you're going to skip meals, which i don't think is particularly advisable (but if you're going to do it, you might as well get the results you want), you may want to go with dinner. if only because all the food in your stomach when you sleep is still there in the morning. and it can cause stomach ulcers over a long period of time.    120 is a wonderfully healthy weight though.|`|7waA9vGeaa	You don't need to lose weight. You're perfectly fine. In fact, I would say you need to eat more fruits and veggies.|`|BYySSA1Raa	i think you lunch was big.  only 1 taco, on WHEAT shell and LEAN beef only.  only BROWN rice.  NO COOKIES.  make sure the cheese was skim or natural and not to fattening and WHEAT bread.  also, the yogurt shouldn't have to many sugars.  otherwise you ate fine, though i would incorporate more fruits and veggies.  definitely do NOT skip meals no matter what.

F3Dhlzedaa	braces the herbst didnt hurt me it just felt weird|`|MjUentmjaa	i dont even know what that is|`|stKghkltaa	I didn't have a herbst, but I heard that brace hurt a lot more, and I agree. I have braces, and they hurt so much. Plus, you have to go through it again every 3 months when you get them tightened.|`|ZzdurUuLaa	i never got the herbst device but braces only hurt for about 3 days. Then you dont feel much :D  I have braces! They SUCK!!!!! ?|`|FyFUvnCIaa	That Herbst devise was a piece of cake compared to braces. I had my braces on first, then they put the herbst on. The thing with braces is, they cut up your mouth and  tongue. It's not to bad though, you can do it! Also, when they take off your devise, make sure they do it carefully. My dentist about ripped my teeth out with these big pliers tool thing. Good luck, your beautiful smile will be worth it in the long run, that's what I tell myself at least! Good luck.|`|p6PZIQNXaa	Herbst|`|1m0BhLmraa	what ever floats ur bubble|`|00A3BfSEaa	Braces hurt sometimes.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	No, you will not get lead poisoning.  Pencils are made of graphite, as everyone else has said- there isn't any lead in there at all or the pencil would never write on paper.  You have a poke hole in your leg, and your body noticed, that's why it's sore now.  You aren't going to die from it, just clean it off- put on some antibiotic ointment if you have it and a band-aid.  I still have a tiny piece of pencil lead in my little finger, a souvenir from a classmate handing me back my pencil.  That was decades ago, and I'm still very much alive- although I have a small black spot on the inside of the finger.  Trust me, you will live.|`|6bqqNsiuaa	You noob. Pencils were never made using lead, but when graphite was discovered, it was called "black lead" for its similarity to lead. So unless it was a poisoned pencil, you'll be fine. Just kiss it better.|`|igI5yX0vaa	No; but graphite isn't good for you either.|`|C5PyVxu8aa	they don't make pencils with led any more its called Graphite no you wont|`|eSoU2C3Waa	no they don't make pencils out of lead any more it's graphite. you're fine.|`|ybpJUWRnaa	No, pencils are made from graphite now. It may leave a black mark on your leg, but it isn't dangerous.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Like the first poster said, pencils do not contain lead these days. They contain graphite. That's exactly why-- children use pencils.    Even though you won't have lead poisoning, you could get an infection. Pour some peroxide on it, and then wrap it with tight pressure until you can get to the ER. Don't wait.|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	Graphite, not lead.     Pencils core have NEVER been made of lead (that's never), the name comes because in the first days of chemistry as a formal science they thought that graphite was a form of lead, something that was later proved to be wrong, but it was already of common use to call the black core of pencils as "lead" even though it never contained the element lead.    Now as for your wound, your biggest concern should be an infection, not lead poisoning.|`|e5811253bdeb94bf218102979982f849aa	nobody has lead pencils anymore. They're made of graphite which is carbon so you won't die soon... or anywhere close to soon depending on your lifestyle.|`|saPP98YHaa	Pencils aren't made with lead anymore. They are made of Graphite.|`|SvzKyWGXaa	OH OUCH.  But don't worry, you can't get lead poisoning, there's no lead in pencils.  It's graphite.  It won't do anything to you, I've been stabbed many times, the most it can do it leave a pencil mark under your skin. But even that'll disappear after a while (couple years?).  It might be a good idea to clean it out with rubbing alcohol.  But no worries there!|`|Rntb3m3vaa	Pencils do not contain lead they contain graphite which is relatively isn't very harm full the itching is probably caused by the would healing
EPeWrtZVaa	That sounds like you're creating little acne bumps on your skin. I delt with the same thing, follow these steps to clear it up:  http://acnegone1.blogspot.com/|`|woxz5TrDaa	Cortisone cream works great!  My husband gets a head rash from working outside, he rubs some in and the rash is gone in an our. You probably just have really sensitive skin. Trust me, it clears it up and immediately stops the itch.
03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	They suck.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	it doesnt hurt to get braces...at least it didnt for me. ut only hurts to get them tightened      best of luckk :)|`|8p8Hy3YBaa	My sister has them, she seemed to hate them. Just dont really eat anything sticky. You'll be fine, just go with the flow and they wont hurt later on.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	in the beginning, but u get used to them|`|441GSyaMaa	I don't think it's so much hurt... It's more of an uncomfortable feeling, it will ache jut because you're not used to it - it won't make your eyes water - only when they tighten the wire i think|`|511f36b32bab3f108f576850ec28ee32aa	oh my gosh it was scary.  It was painful and uncomfortable...but you get used to it later|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Well, for the first week or two.Eat soft food.  Mashed Potatoes  Soup  applesauce  juice   and lots of water.  I recommend not drinking from a straw, it hurt a lot for me.  When you get braces,clean your teeth very well, food tends to get stuck  and no eating hard things.  Good thing is you get to change the color of the rubber bands every month =]  Good luck.|`|7nTJKhW6aa	at first but you get over it! it's really not that bad...your mouth gets sore from the braces and it hurts to chew hard foods for a while but it gets way better|`|UPfL37kaaa	it feels really tight when they first connect them. and it hurts a lot afterwards, it even hurts to brush your teeth :( but it'll get better. i promise.       good luck :)|`|BkMjabPvaa	the 1st 2 weeks   and when you get them tightened they hurt for a few days after but it stops after the 3rd and 4th tightenings    and if you do end up getting rubber bands later in the process it hurts|`|AdwpUbAuaa	yes they hurt but youshould bring something to hold on to so when you get braces you can hold it tightly|`|wzskooHBaa	Look at it this way, if you can take a headache then you will be able to handle braces. I am a person who can't handle pain, but braces were just like a headache to me. Your mouth will just feel sore, but the pain is bearable.   Besides, different people have different experiances. My friend said i wouldn't be able to sleep the night i got them on because of the pain. But i slept just fine.    Good Luck!!! :)|`|AA11762608	I got mine today and no. Only when u chew they hurt.|`|jJAENrvUaa	um.. yes.    sorry :(    it will be sore but it won't be like severe sharp pain (if there is sharp pain--something's wrong).  i mean they're moving your teeth!  and the inside of your mouth will not be used to the feel of metal so be sure to use some wax on the parts that irritate you.    also you should use the kind of numbing mouthwash (i think orajel has mouthwash or something)|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	only for the first couple of days  it's FREAKING PAINFUL TO CHEW   no joke  so eat really soft foods and take a tylenol|`|V64wD6KBaa	i just got them a week ago.   theyre gonna be a little sore in the beginning, and your gonna want to have milkshakes and yougurt to help them feel better.  the soreness goes away after like 4 days and its fine from there  good luck!|`|SPSuhBFbaa	it depends, usually braces are put on with the tops fist and than the bottoms a 1/2 years latter.|`|9z9BW10daa	It's a little sore when they tighten them, but other than that it's fine.  They're just annoying.  But I've had them off for a while now..it may be different for you.    Good luck!|`|brmStGOuaa	They hurt the first maybe week and it feels really weird but after that you can eat perfectly fine. And after that it only hurts for like 2 days after you get them tighten. But the time flies by so fast. I'm getting mine of next month W00T W00T! lol|`|CjMduvW0aa	yes!!!!!!!!!!! be ready!!!!! for me it hurt for 1 and a half weeks and its really hard to eat so eat what you can before you get them on|`|UYvgIazcaa	Mildly painful is how I remember them being.  At least, for the first couple days and after each time they tightened them.  Oh, also whenever I bit my cheeks with those damnable things.    It never got so painful that I couldn't handle it.  Tho' there were a couple nights where the soreness of recently tightened braces was just distracting enough to keep me awake.    It is at no point ever a sharp pain.  Just an ache.  You'll be fine.|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	I'm sorry for the slight pain you shall feel for the first few weeks but if you need them then you need the but USE LOTS OF orgel it really works......|`|dc3fcb2ffda1c2c10e4e446b8c254a71aa	The only thing that hurt a LITTLE for me , was my ortho filed my teeth, and it hits the nerves and is uncomfortable for a second, also.. the glue tastes NASTY.  make sure to take advil before you go in, so it kicks in byt he time it starts to get sore.  it'll hurt for about 3-4 days, when you live off soup. :)  its worth it in the end though !|`|98PixCsEaa	hi!! i've had braces for 5 months (6 months on wednesday) and they don't hurt that much after you get used to them!! when i got mine on, they felt fine! but the pain starts coming on a few hours after. the REAL pain lasts over 3 days usually. they hurt me for about 5 or 6 days. but after the first couple days you start to get used to them and they don't hurt as much!! the brackets n' stuff usually poke around everywhere and cause sores that really hurt, though!! so wax usually helps (they'll probably give some to you) and when they change wires & tighten them they hurt for a while, too...not for too long, though. i have rubber bands too and they don't bug that much either. but they won't give you rubber bands when you get them on!! soo after the first few weeks or so you'll be used to them and they won't really hurt at all!! but straight teeth is worth it!!! good luck!!!
X4U36dHzaa	more than likely you have pulled a muscle or strained it,or you could have  torn your calf muscle if it's a really sharp pain then you have torn it for sure!just walk it out and if it still hurts after a week or two go get a scan!|`|yCR6qg0baa	Did you tear a ligament (requires surgery)?

k24zcshxaa	If you are severely anxious when you take it, the Valium won't make you go to sleep, but after the procedure you will probably be very groggy.     Effects seem to last different amounts of time for different individuals. Could be a few hours, could be a few days    Yes it will cause your anxiety to go away. You might not even remember the procedure, or only bits and pieces.

For someone who's never had it, that will be quite a strong dose. I used to be prescribed it for anxiety and was only allowed 5mg tablets. They just make you calm and relaxed and a little tired.

When using birth control pills you should not have unprotected sex until you finish the first pack.|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	Hmm...I took the Plan B; it did make me sick for a week though.

fa168ead7a3b2811d62c6f6c92ed03c7aa	some people simply don't hae regular periods; there's not really anything wrong with that either, except that an unexpected period can be a real pain. If you're concerned, you should ask your gyno directly; they can tell you more than I can :)  There are other advantages to going on the pill though; it can reduce cramping and clear up acne.|`|7B9jLv6Uaa	i pray for you

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Plan B is not necessary, and taking it will NOT bring on your period.  What it will do is seriously mess up your cycle.  You were protected by your birth control pill, even though you didn't take the last one on time.   The pill doesn't have to be taken at the exact same time each day.  They recommend you do to help you remember to take it- but as long as you take one a day you will be fine.  Even your own body won't produce hormones on such a tightly timed schedule, and you won't spontaneously ovulate if you miss yours by a few hours.  Most ladies have to be off the pill for months before a regular cycle re-establishes.  At this point, you would be best to continue taking your pills as prescribed, and pause for the usual seven days.  I do not know if you will have a withdrawl bleed or not, or if you will have breakthough bleeding- both are possible.  Best bet for you is to continue to take your pills as prescribe and don't take Plan B at the same time ever.   The birth control pill is better than 99% effective all on it's own.  As long as you have taken it for more than 30 days and have taken one per day, you have no pregnancy risk to speak of.  Even if you  miss one or two, you are still protected.  I can't stress this enough- do NOT take Plan B with birth control pills.  You were already protected against pregnancy.  However, that's all you were protected against.  Since you had sex without a condom, you have other things to worry about.  Pregnancy is not one of them.  And no, you can't just take a few birth control pills all at once.  You don't need to, and it will really mess matters up.  One per day, every single day, and no more.  And no Plan B.|`|Q9e6sqOTaa	HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! LOSER!!!!!!!!!!!! lol.. later buddy..... ;)

39x9tNJzaa	OCD is an anxiety disorder.  OCPD is the same thing, except it's a personality disorder, and sufferers of OCPD generally don't realize that they are.    Treating the underlying anxiety will help you overcome it.    I have some slight OCD, and as with you it's only triggered by stress and anxiety.  It's small things that I don't even realize I'm doing, like being completely unable to step on cracks, having to separate my food on my plate before eating it, compulsively straighting things, making things parallel and even, etc.  It's a stress and anxiety disorder.

CD5C2nhFaa	Tampons are designed to be easiest to removed when they're full of "stuff." So since you didn't insert this one properly, it didn't absorb all that it could, and it will hurt to remove.     This has happened to me, and you're just going to have to grit your teeth, relax your muscles, and PULL. Just keep pulling. It'll eventually come out.     However, if the string breaks off or if it just doesn't come out, you'll need to tell your mom immediately so you can go to the ER. If the tampon stays in too long, you could get TSS.    Good luck!|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	Its best to pull it out quick it may be painful but you don't want to get an infection for leaving it in there too long.

Its doesnt hurt thatttt bad. its over in a sec.|`|n1dmMABvaa	It might be hurting since it's probably not filled up.  The cotton can stick to the dry walls of your inside, unless it's soaked with either discharge or menstrual blood.  You're using one that's too thick.   Get the smallest size and keep those in case you have a heavy day.  Okay, now get into the shower. Try to keep your legs around 2-3 feet apart if you can. Wrap the string around your finger and pull down, outward slightly.   You might have to wait a while for the shower to wet it. You have to keep your legs apart, though.   If you can't, ask your mom for help.  If your embarrassed about it, keep trying. You might have to pull out really quickly, no matter how much it hurts. It'll go away faster.     If you had inserted it right, you should have just pushed it around slightly as you went, making sure it felt comfortable. Because you shouldn't feel the tampon.     Hope this helps. (:|`|ouLKDu2taa	Okay, I know it hurts but you NEED to take it out.     You need to relax every muscle in your body before you try to pull it out. Try resting in some more water, again.

But seriously, just pull the string and get over it.  Next time, push it in farther, and make sure you're using the right absorbency for your cycle.

Just do it.|`|XEbDgBBUaa	First thing is, relax.  I am assuming you are a virgin, so the tampon is likely getting stuck on your hymen.

39x9tNJzaa	The fact that you're worried about it shows that you do have one.  Are you depressed?  Stressed?  Stress, anxiety, and depression can cause you to detach to the extent that you have.  If that's the case, go out and do things you enjoy doing and try to cheer yourself up.
tBF9VfPqaa	The place to start is with a dentist. They can measure the space and make sure everything is ok. Most of the rods that are screwed into the jaw are done by an oral surgeon. (Usually it is better to have them do it because they do it more often).    She will probably have to then go back to the dentist and have the restoration done around the implanted rod.     This of course, all depends on what your doctors capabilities are.     Just ask your dentist and see what his/her plan is and go from there. If you think something sounds fishy, get a second opinion.    Good luck to you guys!!!|`|7c26fd5d1b1f30273669ffa93a7dafedaa	I would recommend the number 1 discount dental provider in the nation.

GBG2hbQ4aa	I wanted to play the guitar very well myself.  Through the course of my life, I have had time periods where the guitar is the last thing I have time, energy or desire for.  Those times, as time tends to do, pass.   And my love of the guitar resurfaces and I get back on track with the learning and the playing.     I don't think it's your OCD at all.  Just a bit of the human element, you know the one where you aren't in the same place today as you were yesterday as far as what is important to you, what you want to spend your time on.  You will most likely find  that your desire to play the guitar will return to you.  In the meantime, make the most of everyday and enjoy what you are doing.
wTmGTmC4aa	They use general anesthesia for this surgery, so you are completely asleep for it.  You are usually in the hospital for no more than 23 hours.  Some surgeons will send you home the same day.  If you are going to be having this done, talk to your surgeon and the anesthesiologist and let them know how you feel in regards to any fears about the surgery, pain, etc.      Good luck to you!

Nothing more than that probably.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	Usually a physical does not include a pap smear or any kind of girly gyno stuff like that.

Thanks!      One thing that he might find embarassing, that a lot of men try out is pills for sexual enhancement. Whether it's for penis size or for better erections, most men don't want to talk openly about those things. I can't say for sure without the imprint (if any) on the actual tablet, but it's always an option.    Oh, I just found a website for Extenze (penis enlarger pill). Here's the link   http://www.extenze-direct.com/?a=emoshe&...  The little picture in the top corner shows pills that are blue and oval. Could be?|`|GNpCY9Dnaa	I'll tell you this - nobody wants to admin those are theirs.     Those are a nal laxatives. I use them all the time. I'm not regular, so I have to use them. They're quite embarrasing to let others know about them, but, that's what they are.    Usually, you have to use them when things aren't going how they "regularly" would go.     Try them out and see if I'm correct. I probably am.
nksewi03aa	Your symptoms could be a couple of things.  In order of likilhood:    1. You have Grand Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC for short), a fancy way of saying you have a very common type of eye infection.  Take your bottom lid and gently look at the inside to see if it is very red and "cobblestone" in texture.  It is very easy to transfer this infection from one eye to the other with your fingers so that's why the other one may have started hurting.    2. You are experiencing as strain in the muscles that surround the eyelids from not wearing your glasses.  This usually shows up as a headache though, but pain in the eye is a slightly less common symptom.    3. You have possibly actually bruised your eyelid by rubbing it too hard.  The eyelid is very delicate tissue and you can rupture blood vessels in it (a bruise) without having it be visible on the outside surface.    If this has been going on for more than a week, simply go to an Optometrist to have him check your eye out.  It wil take less than 30 minutes and there is no pain involved.  At a chain store like Pearlevision or Lenscrafters, an optometrist will probably charge you less than $45 dollars for a complete examination including prescribing medication, if required.|`|kp0QYdb9aa	do you wear makup, it might just be a sty which is a pimple in your eye, ive had them before because i wear makeup on my eyes, maybee its a co insedence that u got it in both eyes?|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	Not sure what it could be but your eye pain is nothing to fool around with.

lUe3IRozaa	There's not really any such thing as 'double jointed', but you may have loose ligaments or abnormally wide cups. Some people are more flexible than others. If it's only been doing this recently, it might be time to see a doctor. If your hip has always done this but has become tender in the past few days, you might just want to wait a while and see if it gets better on its own. :)|`|AA11707728	Your hip is a ball and pivot joint (as opposed to being hinge like).  So, by its nature it is double jointed.  Popping in and out of the socket like that is not good so don't do that.

Your finger, stick it in as far as it goes, NO FURTHER.  If it all fits, then it won't do any harm.    It's your nose, pick it if you want, there is nothing wrong with that -- however, there is nothing up there except dried sn*t, or if you prefer b*ggers.  It's really ok to pick them -- do so if you want.  Use your finger if you can, if you can't, try a cue tip, not a needle.  If you need to use a pencil, then use it, eraser first, but don't force it higher than it easily fits.    *hug* You are wonderful, just as you are.    Kind thoughts,    Hermes    PS, actually, using cue tips or rolled tissue, or something else that tickles the inside of your nose, you might be able to induce a series of sneezes, that is likely to loosen whatever is bothering you, and blow it out -- and that is good, not bad, so go for it if you dare.

If you want an orgasm, then you need lots of foreplay including clitoral stimulation.  Lots of men just dont have the skills/knowlege to pull that off, or they dont care because they just want to stick it in.  Thats why it is important that you know how to pleasure yourself so that you can show your man how its done.  Also i think that orgasms for women involve more of a mind - body conection than it does for men so you have to be in the right frame of mind to be pleasured wheras men can get aroused from just about anything.|`|4qvvHTGLaa	uh usually men like getting in your vag but women get orgasms usually by playing with the clit

abae6afaf05cd4433e382fc342911d20aa	Go to the doctor and let he/she figure it out. It is best not to assume or diagnose yourself.
Z0SiMz7daa	I don't think this is something you can just assume.  There are numerous reasons for pain in the stomach and this is just one of them.  Often times MA will mimic appendicitis.  You can't rule out appendicitis without a physical exam and some laboratory studies.|`|AA10520442	It could be Crohn's Disease, too.  Better let a doctor decide.
kK4GG6Z2aa	You can assume - but would be unwise to do so - got following info off website...However you may have appendicitis, which can be dangerous..so rather than assuming please go to doctors to have it checked out.  Self diagnosis can be dangerous...Notice last sentence in this report.  Website info........Infections cause our 'glands' to swell  you might have noticed this from time to time in your neck when you have had a sore throat or sore ear. The commonest lymph glands to swell in this way are in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin. It's easy to spot these because they get sore and swollen.     However, there are similar glands inside the abdomen around the blood supply to your gut  in what is called the 'mesentery'. When these glands swell to fight a virus, or other infection, they get sore but you can't see the swelling.     All the patient is aware of is tummy pain and feeling a bit fevered. To doctors it can look exactly like appendicitis and it is only clear that this is not the case once the surgeon does an operation and finds the appendix to be perfectly healthy.     So, with 'mesenteric adenitis', which settles all by itself, it is a matter of waiting until it goes away, but being careful to exclude appendicitis.)  Good luck and hope you feel better soon.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Junk food is relatively cheap, but more importantly, is very fast.    Sure, brown rice and dried beans are cheap and healthy. But it takes quite some time to prepare. A typical poor person may be working two minimum wage shifts every day, as well as taking care of their children. It is much easier for them to buy $1 hamburgers from McDonalds than to be soaking beans for hours.    Fresh fruits and vegetables can be problematic too. Unless you live in an agricultural area with nice weather, your produce is shipped from very far away at least part of the year. This makes produce more expensive.    Now I'm not making excuses, nor am I saying all poor people eat badly or all other people eat healthy food.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Families who do not have the means, usually have fear of loosing the gift from the Government; Food Stamps.

You are able to buy a box of Mac & Cheese for 0.33 and a Kiwi for 0.60, which one would you buy, the box that will feed 4, or the Kiwi that hardly feeds 1 ?   Low income families do not have the knowledge of inexpensive healthy foods, and choose to eat what they are accustomed to.|`|5l2kTANaaa	Maybe because they let themselves "go" because they do not have hopes/goals in life ??    I agree : healthy food is much cheaper than fast food. A sandwich made up with lettuce, tomatoes, tuna is much cheaper.    A banana will be cheaper as a snack  too than a pack of Doritos..    A healthy soup/casserole made of pasta, frozen veg, ground beef etc can be made in record time..and tasty too...there are condiments out there ! And accommodate large families.    To me : junk food is more expensive on the contrary ( at least where I live)    I do not buy into that "uneducated" excuse. There is way too much info about nutrition out there. Including in the tabloids ! To me that excuse is getting a bit old now......in my opinion.    PS: funny to see the examples of salmon, kiwis etc...why choose the most expensive ?    People should buy what is in season ! Am not going to buy watermelon during wintertime !    I think they DO know actually but like everybody else..convenient food is OK once in a while. Who wants to cook every day ? Not many. Me included.    Not all poor people are stupid ! Some know how to manage their budget very well.    Go to  a soup kitchen/shelter here and they serve MUCH healthier food to the needy. But gosh how many folks I have seen spending $8 or more on McDo (per person for one meal) and then complaining that they have no money !    ( am in Canada by the way.....fast food might be more expensive than in the US)    your first answerer Aubrey might be on to something in my opinion.    Could be a question of culture passed down too..some like their food very oily and very rich.

($1.99 a pound can really add up!) However, fast food is available in bulk for a low price. Like those Taco Bell commercials for burritos or something for 79 cents. For about $3 at most places you can get a burger, fries, a huge soda, and a little dessert.     Also, there tend to be more sources of unhealthy foods in poorer neighborhoods. Wealthy neighborhoods will often have farmer's markets, organic markets, and places like that.

Not only that, but they hardly sound as rude as you do right now.    I suggest next time you see a poor lowly little peasant you ask him why he eats "unhealthful"  foods and see what happens.    If you get punched in the face, take some pictures and show us.|`|I08iONdaaa	Well poor families are statistically larger than wealthier ones. On top of that, many just don't have the education that richer families do. And to make matters worse, junk food is incredibly cheap, tasty, and easy to prepare. Poor families might know that trans-fat is bad for you, but they don't know "why" most of the time, and the result is that they will gladly sacrifice healthy choices for the easier and equally affordable choice. A lot of foods are bought on the basis of convenience as well as affordability. When you're focus is feeding as many people as efficiently as you can, sometimes that means buying instant rice instead of bagged rice, or instant mashed potatoes instead of making your own.     So i would say 1) lack of education 2)affordability and 3) convenience compel poorer families to eat poorly.|`|fIEmi84Laa	Because unhealthy food is delicious and cheap.

Most of your list was starchy foods- great for filling a belly, but not the only foods you need to stay healthy.  As long as the store brand macaroni and cheese is priced at 33 cents per box or so- and the fish sticks are just a couple of bucks- a poor family is going to be choosing that over fresh fish, couscous, and fresh veggies.  Store brand baloney and hot dogs are still cheaper than ground round, and the total at the cash register is still higher for a healthy diet than an unhealthy one.  If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.  We spend far more for the healthy diet of our family than friends who don't.  After all, they spend less than 10 bucks at Taco Bell for a meal for four.  I spent that much just for the salmon we had for supper last night.|`|clOf0PDRaa	because they are usually uneducated.  funny..i am talking to my friend on msn about this EXACT suject.

PHYj1UPwaa	I believe that is very true, but also other factors are involved...are we wallowing in guilt or pity..do we grieve over lost loved ones...how about decisions in our life we have made and chose not to make the right choice...we can see the positive or negative in any situation..the secret is learning to let go...the mistakes, the burdens, the regrets..we have to trust that God is in control and He knows which road we should take..Just let go and learn to be happy..no matter the outcome...

Believe me, dying from COPD, lung cancer, and many of the other diseases that smoking causes is not a pretty way to go.|`|p8yphpjYaa	Your Answer:  I'm going to give you the same answer I gave another person on this subject. You should talk to some people who have COPD. I work in a pulmonologist's office, and you should hear some of these people. There are thousands upon thousands of really young people with COPD now. Difficulty breathing, coughing constantly, always sounding extremely phlegmy when talking, I mean, this is disgusting! How would you like to be dependent on carrying around an oxygen tank, having to plan your days travels around how long your oxygen tank will last before you need to go home because you can't breathe without it?? Do you think people are going to want to be around you when you sound like you're coughing up furry mucus-soaked wads of crap 24/7??|`|rUMlDAINaa	Soon they will be putting skeletal images on cig packets - very graphic ones, from what I've heard.     I empathize with the smokers' on this issue - I think the Truth Ads and the no-smoking bans for entire communities (like one in CA - check out NY Times for article) are infringing upon personal liberties.  Frankly, I wonder why they are chipping away at this issue, rather than simply banning smoking outright, like pot/coke/heroin.  Drinking and driving is far more dangerous than smoking and driving; and what about obesity? On packs of snack cakes, why don't they put the image of a disgusting fatbody stuffing his face, along with a surgeon general's warning about how high-calorie, low-quality foods cause diabetes, among other ailments?  I don't think it's entirely fair or fully realized by either side, the smokers or non-smokers.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	SOMEONE BECAME SERIOUSLY  ILL FROM SMOKING.  SUED THE CIG. MANUFACTURE COMPANY AND WON.

p8yphpjYaa	Yep, you can still have children, but having had in the past makes it more likely you'll have a tubal pregnancy, which is when the embryo attaches itself in the tube instead of the uterus. PID causes scarring inside the tubes, which makes it easier for the embryo to attach. I had it, and carried a very successful pregnancy a few years later. Keep trying.|`|sG8Hei8gaa	yes it is possible i heard of people having children after having pid but check with your doctor to run tests. to help to aviod an ectopic or tubal before trying ok. i also had pid so i know how you feel good luck.

VsxC8pZSaa	There is a lot to building muscles esspecially for a skinny guy.    I know you will need to eat more calories to have enough energy to grow muscles but eat calorie dense food that has a lot in it without it making you too full like avacado, tune and salmon in olive oil and rice too i think.

ur3vgbXoaa	I used to give 'Colace' to my kids if they needed a stool softener.  It worked great.  Yes it is legal...just like vitamins or anything else over the counter.    There are 'fiber pills' at walmart or places like that which are really cheap, but I think the liquid colace would be quicker.    Be sure you do stuff according to the directions!|`|iN0cyZoTaa	In the US you can buy stool softener at any age.  Miralax is good.  Like the other answerer said you can use the suppositories and they'll work faster.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	The fastest ones are the glycerin suppositories. You can by them at any age.

cazm5qZbaa	Atro-phex as well as other supplemental fat burners can be seriously dangerous to take before 18 (the general age that puberty has run it's course). Atro-phex messes with a number of normal body functions in adults (ie insulin which regulates blood glucose levels). My advice to you is to seek a medical professional (certified MD, not the medical professionals -which could be anyone who doesn't have proper medical training) and a professional trainer who deals with supplements on a daily basis. Try to find someone who is NOT going to try to sell you something because they will say ANYTHING to get you to purchase their products.       Really what you need to do is cardiovascular work (ie elliptical, treadmill). Sure you are burning fat by gaining muscle, but really the most effective way to drop weight is cardio. I know it isn't any fun...but you have to do it. 30 minutes at least (once you reach your target heart rate).|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Yes. Your body and, more importantly, your brain, are still growing and developing. Depriving your body of fat now by taking those things can stunt your growth, mess with brain function, and seriously screw up your internal organs.|`|5ciDai7Paa	That's a question to ask your doctor. My advice would definitely be don't because 1) Your not 18 & 2) You don't know what it could do to you.|`|0KTVNTYYaa	get a jump rope|`|nMgsLNAAaa	you're an idiot.  unless you are obese fat burning will be worse for you.  I remember plateauing around 225 at 17-18 years old.  Now i'm 20 and doing about 275, but I haven't gained any weight in the last 2 years so I'm saying it's natural to plateau unless you get bigger or TRULY change the routine up.    try.....  5 reps sets in order of....115 125 135 145 155 165 175 185 than 3 rep sets of 195 215 235 and then max out. Gets you stronger|`|MzWM9rBRaa	First off I don't think your max bench has anything to do with your body fat percentage.  Second, there's a reason they say 18 and up, and its usually because your body is still developing at that age and there's a chance something could get screwed up, and not to mention if it does, the legal consequences are astounding.      If you want to up your max, try some techniques like 'shocking' your muscles with other exercises for a month or two.  For example, clap push-ups and dumbbell training (varies up your range of motion and improves muscle growth in parts that aren't trained in the bench press)|`|UzJQA1v1aa	Any unnatural way to lose weight is pretty unhealthy. A lot of the time those things backfire and  you end up gaining so much more fat among many more severe consequences. You may want to schedule an appointment with your doctor to see if this is     safe     for you|`|ZxdYTZoHaa	dont take fat burners just eat healthy or balance your calories no more than 2000

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	White spots are hypocalcified marks either when the  teeth were forming or if plaque sat on the teeth for a while.  When the teeth dry out (like sleeping and breathing through your mouth), the white spots dry out and become more bright.  When the teeth are rehydrated, they blend a little better.  Over the counter whitening can make the spots look more bright right at first, but over time, the background color will come up and make the white look less obvious.  If the white spots are superficial, then sometimes the dentist can deep polish them to make them less.|`|kp0QYdb9aa	gargle with baking soda and hydrogin peroxide mix it together and add salt.. gargle every night till the spots are gone... really works but taste gros!!!|`|b8R5bPrhaa	http://www.dentalfind.com/White_Spots_on...

nUu7tUiqaa	Go to Planned Parenthood. They have a website, google it.

I really thought mine would flip when I asked for them, but she was okay with it. Explain that you just want less severe periods, as well as predictable ones. Talk to her about it calmly, preferably in a public place, like a restaurant. She'll have a harder time freaking out in a public area and will be more willing to sit and listen.|`|AA11306457	Go to Planned Parenthood.  They work on a sliding scale and your pills along with your examination shouldn't be too expensive.  Also contact your local health dept. and tell them you are looking for low cost birth control and where are some options for you to go.
nUu7tUiqaa	With birth control there are two ways to start properly:    Either on the day you start your period, or on the first Sunday AFTER you start your period. Either start on Sunday, or wait until your next period to start taking your pills.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	You should try to take them like the package says: Day one of period or Sunday after period starts. That way you make sure that your cycle isn't thrown off.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	The instructions usually say to start either on the Sunday after you start your period or on the day you start your period.  You don't have to start on Sunday, but actually need to start taking them during your period.  If you do, you only need to take 7 with some brands to be protected from pregnancy.    hope this helps..|`|a12cbnR4aa	Take the first pill the first sunday after the last day of your period.

RIcMWeSKaa	Its different for everyone because of your pain tolerance and everything.    But, the process is veryyyy long and veryyyy boring, but it doesnt hurt or anything. :)  I was super scared, I went for my evaluation and 2 weeks later I had them! :P  Butttt, when you get them on, go and eat right away. It doesnt hurt at first, and you'll think, "Hey, this isnt bad! What were people thinking?" Then, a few hours or so later, the pain just starts. Its kind of a numbing pain, like you leaned on your teeth at night really hard or something.  Its incredible, you like hurt so much it gets numb, and then you cant feel your teeth! You chew, but you dont realize it!  This sounds superrrr bad and terrible, but it really isnt.  The pain stops about 2 to 3 days, but it wasnt really normal until 5 or so days.  I got mine over the summer, so I didnt worry about school.    If it hurts A LOT, and you cant stand them at school, get your orthodontist to write you a note so you can take pain meds whenever you need them at the nurses office. I would recommend the liquid motrin, its fast and you dont have to swallow anything. :)    As for what you can/cant eat, they say not to eat soooo much stuff, but as long as your careful and not gnawing on anything like your an animal, you can eat more or less anything.  Just keep off the bread (it gets stuck), gum, straws, pens, ice, cheetos, pretzels, CARROTS!, and stuff like that for the first month or whatever.  Once they are on there and you feel more comfortable, just test it out. Oh and make sure to break everything up, front brackets are the weakest!      Hope this helps, and good luck! :)))|`|PGJKLZCVaa	Your teeth feel heavy! and are soar.. i had them for 3 years!! And the first day i gotten them my parents fed me handburgers!

Unfortunately some of them do tend to go on about it a bit and think that condoms are untrustworthy. They don't get commissions. I think they just see a lot of unwanted pregnancies from girls not on the pill. Or girls who want it but are too shy to ask.

PeCm21meaa	a bmi of over 30 is considered obese, anywhere over 25 is overweight.  in my opinion a bmi of over 27-28 is unhealthy.  so that's like 40 lbs overweight.  25 lbs isn't great, but i don't think it is terrible either.  but over 40 lbs overweight would cause health issues i believe.|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	Being overweight is not healthy. They have ranges so for example, if you are 5'2" you should weigh 105-120 (these are not actual, just using for example) so those are the ranges that are healthy, anything over that, is not. I recommend talking to a doctor, or a nutritionist.|`|cgLbcHNtaa	Select the measurement system you wish to use. A BMI calculator is able to calculate body mass index either in United States measurements or metric measurements. The BMI calculator at the Mayo Clinic's website has a button that changes the measurement system (see Resources below).    Input your weight into the BMI calculator. The weight will either be measured in pounds or in kilograms, depending on the measurement system used. A BMI calculator such as the one at the Partnership for Healthy Living does accept decimal numbers for extra precision (see Resources below).    Enter your height into the BMI calculator. A BMI calculator using metric measurements will need to use the height as measured in meters, while a BMI calculator keyed to United States measurements will need the height as measured in inches.    Hit the enter or calculate button located on the BMI calculator and observe the results. If you have followed the steps correctly, the resulting number should be somewhere between 18 and 40. A number below or above that range means that you are extremely underweight or extremely overweight, respectively.|`|utJYCCvaaa	you should go on Body fat percentage not BMI cause BMI i'm obese and i only have 16% bodyfat
R9OfKCEjaa	Wow, I can't believ it, your story sounds exactly the same as mine and we are the same age.    About 2 years ago I broke up with my bf of around 4 years just as I was starting university. I then fell into a huge depression and had to quit studying, 2 years in a row. I spent MONTHS at home, not eating, not showering, not leaving the house, doing nothing. I had horrible, crippling anxiety/panic disorder to the point I would pace the room and nearly faint. If I did go out, I would also drink and get on the drugs. In this time I was being trialled on a couple of different anti-deps until I found the right one for me, Zoloft.    I'm still on it til this day and won't go off it for anything! Now I'm back to my old self, happy and outgoing and energetic. I have a different bf now.... but if you don't like the one your seeing, don't just stick with him because you don't want to be alone, I know what thats like, you both will get hurt in the end.    You need to be patient and wait for your medication to work, trust me... If the anxiety is too much to handle in the mean time, ask your doctor for something as a short term relief. I was prescribed Xanax and it was the best thing I ever had! You can't have it for long periods of time as you can get hooked, but great for short term.    Don't stress about money, just focus on yourself and don't be ashamed of any of it. I always said, I'm staying home (not working etc) to get myself well otherwise I'll end up doing the same thing but in a psych ward.    You'll be fine, I know you don't believe it right now, but you will :) Good luck.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Yes there is help keep positive tell someone|`|t2R3mEMoaa	One, the money you are wasting could be used for your holiday and two, the anti-depressants will not work as long as you are drinking and/or using. Maybe it's time for a 12 step meeting which won't do you any harm and you may even get your life back. Your choice!|`|39x9tNJzaa	Never be ashamed to tell your doctor about your problems.  Believe me, they've seen and heard it all.  Holding back information doesn't help them help you, either, as they don't actually have the full picture.    As for where you can get help, well, set up another appointment with your doctor and tell them the same things you posted here.  They can set you up with a counselor.      Antidepressants are nice and really helpful, but they can't actually do anything for your depression in the long run, they can only hide it.  It will take time for them to kick in.  It took nearly 5 weeks for me to even notice any effect when I started taking Zoloft.  But what's more important than the medication is treating the underlying cause of your depression.  Set up an appointment with a therapist.|`|n16F1SiHaa	First of all I'm very sorry for what you are going through! I have been through a very similar situation..it's hard but you really have to try to preoccupy your self and you have to be very honest with your Dr. drinking with some of those meds can cause very serious reactions! Also if you have insurance look on the back of your card and there is a number that you can call for mental health help. You have to be patient with the meds, after they kick in they do really work...keep your head up and remember you are a wonderful person! I hope things work out for you! :o)|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours.

The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|edFyHFRhaa	It sounds to me like you have got yourself stuck into a little bit of a rut. What I hear in your words is someone who is a bit overwhelmed with their life at the moment and isn't sure what to do/say/feel about it. From my own experience, in this type of situation, the best thing you can do is to stop... take in some deep cleansing breaths and reassure yourself that you are OK, things will be fine, you're just under some pressure right now. I think by stopping and slowing down your thoughts, recognising what you are saying to yourself you may come to calm down some and see things more clearly and as a result you will naturally help your situation.    One thing to mention though is that taking drugs or alcohol while on anti-depressants will only lessen the effects of the AD's. In order for the AD's to work properly you need to not interfere with them, they simply won't work properly while you are drinking so waiting for the effects of them to kick in will be pointless.    Your best bet is to lay off the drugs & alcohol... try to give it at least a month and in 2 weeks or so your AD's should start taking effect.    In the meantime, talk through your thoughts with ppl online, there are many many websites for depression and anxiety you just need to google it and choose one you feel looks comfortable for you.    Keep your chin up.

It sounds like u have type 1 herpes already. So what happened is if u got infected with type 2 your antibodies for your type 1 herpes helped your type 2 herpes not spread an outbreak. Trust me hun its very confusing i will give u my situation. I was just tested like 3 weeks ago. I had no signs no systems at all. I am glad i went to test. I was diagnosed about 2 weeks ago now. I still don't get it to why i don't have no signs or systems. I think ive had mine for about 3 months now. Plus it can take a month to 3 months to get herpes type 2 tested positive cause it takes that long for your antibodies to build up to register on a std test.

Cold sores around the mouth can be caused by the virus that causes genital herpes--from oral sex.  The virus gets into the body over the mucus membranes.  Once herpes manifests itself somewhere, you cannot get reinfected with the same virus (oral or genital) elsewhere on your body.    I would say that your chances of getting an honest answer from your boyfriend are slim to none.  That's not relationship advice--it's common sense.|`|HAKQ1BMSaa	Unfortunately for their partners, some men can have genital herpes and never have an outbreak. They can be silent carriers. Women can do the same, but it is more common in men.    Hopefully your doctor took a swab sample and sent it in to the lab to confirm her diagnosis.     Also, does your partner have cold sores? If he performed oral sex on you it is possible that he spread a herpes cold sore to your genitals. Herpes Simplex Virus 1 is oral herpes (mouth sores) and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 is genital herpes. However, it is possible to have HSV1 on your genitals or HSV2 on your mouth.    Basically, any place in your body that has a mucosal lining (anus, mouth, genitals) can spread/be affected by herpes.|`|zhhvSykHaa	He must have herpes.  many people have herpes, you may see who have herpes at pozcupid.com in your area

16Ta67kDaa	What you should do depends on how bad the burn is, if the area that was burned is red and swollen/blistered then it is probably a 2nd degree burn. If the burn has blisters that are not open, first remove any clothing or jewelry from the injured area. Then, hold the burned area under cool running water for around 10 minutes to stop the burning process. You can also use a clean towel or wash cloth moistened with cold water. However, dont use ice or ice water because they will further damage the tissue. Do not break open the blisters, or there will be a greater risk of infection. If the blisters are open, dont remove any clothing that might be stuck to the burn, and dont run water over the burn. Use sterile gauze to bandage the burned area, you should change the bandage daily. Make sure to keep the bandaging relatively loose to make sure air can still get at it. Try to keep your hand raised to reduce swelling. Putting butter,creams, or ointments can actually slow down the healing and make the burn worse because air can't escape, if you do decide to put something on it, make sure it won't trap the heat in. In fact, you should probably go online yourself to find something that might work. Hope this helps!    -Tori|`|Ds3G8yVxaa	My dads a dr. so put any antibiotic(neosporin or something) because that will make your finger of cracking (not literly cracking just like when you need chapstick really bad but for finger.)

After 30 minutes your skin should have cooled down and you will be able to take off the ice.    If there is any sort of a skin split/cut, apply something like TCP or antiseptic wipes.

Or maybe your hippie aunt or uncle with all the vintage stuff has one and you could start your own plant off that.  You will get burned again, so the aloe vera will be the best option.  butter kinda works, but not as well.|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	Do you have some Aloe gel in the house or even an aloe plant?

WlywfjG1aa	Normally amoxicillin should be able to get rid of bacterial infection and your clogged and inflamed sinuses should get cleared and you become symptomless.

Antibiotics will not work for sinus infections.  Most sinus infections are caused by fungi NOT bacteria.  Try nasal irrigation right away.  Also antibiotics cannot reach the sinus cavities.  Most doctors are no longer prescribing antibiotics for sinusitis. Nasal irrigation will work fast on your sinuses and flush them out-- 3 times a day to start. Nurse Kindheart|`|TfbTYc2Laa	Nobody can tell you exact time but these practices will limit your healing time to less than 4-5 days. But before, you should know that it is not antibiotics or other kinds of medication what can keep you free of sinus problems. They may clear an existing infection in your sinuses but this is not the end of the story because (sorry for repeating) microbes which cause sinusitis are always present in the air you breathe. Thus, you need something to prevent infections from returning again and again.  Luckily, you have a strong servant which can do this task. This servant is the innate cleansing system which is installed in your sinuses. It is called Mucociliary System. It serves to trapand to some degreedestroy particles like pollen and foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria and other infectious agents.  The sad fact is that mucociliary system is delicate and prone to damage and failure. Its failure is the root of many chronic nose and sinus problems today. Be sure to read my articles at http://www.howtogetridofsinusitis.com/ar... to learn how you can prevent sinusitis attacks from returning. They are very informative. You may find your solution there.    To speed up your healing, I suggest abstaining from solid foods as this practice greatly decreases the healing time in cases of the common cold, the flu and acute sinusitis. Its a good idea for people suffering from these conditions to fast for a few days on fruits, fruit juice, vegetable juice or green smoothies or at least to completely avoid fried foods, meat and dairy. Be assured that:  "Good diet is a perfect way of curing.  And worthy much regard and health assuring.  A king that cannot rule him in his dyet,  Will hardly rule his realme in peace and quiet.  (Regimen Sanitis Salernitanum , 11th Century)    Supplementation: The most helpful supplement in times of cold and the flu is vitamin C in ester form. Take one to two grams of ester-C to help your immune system to fight against viruses.(This is not an excessive amount of vitamin C. Giant apes, by eating several kilograms of raw fruits and vegetables, take more vitamin C every day).  It is the body that can heal the flu, common cold and even sinusitis; and what you can do is to help your body do it via reducing inflammation and strengthening the immune system. And then, the body can heal faster than any cure! So, let it heal.      Best wishes.

Even though it took 2 years, it's well worth the wait to have perfect teeth.|`|FDQFrP5haa	I have braces now, and was told I'd only need them for 6-9 months :D  But that's because  1)My teeth only need minor adjustment  2)I have "Tip-Edge" braces, which are faster than conventional ones|`|w9Yqi10kaa	My orthodontist predicted 22 months and I got them off in 20 months.  My friend, on the other hand... her orthodontist predicted 20 months and she had them on for around 36 months.    I think it varies, but just make sure you use your rubber bands if you're supposed to and make sure not to break anything!|`|HDuAx2I4aa	I had my braces for about 2 and a half years which was earlier than my orthodontist had told me. However, this depends on the person. Some people I know had their braces on for much longer than the orthodontist had told them and others have them on for less time. Good Luck, braces are a pain!!|`|XOgvpDiZaa	I had braces for...four years and I got them off at the exact date my orthodontist told me. Which was amazing!    But my friend, poor thing got her braces off then had to get them put back on because of her jaw. She's a freshman in college and has braces.|`|FkSONG6Maa	I had mine on for 4 years. I had them for 2 years then they took them off and gave me a retrainer. About half a year later when all my adult teeth were grown in I had them put back on and i am now getting them off for good. But this was for me, and every ones teeth are diffrent so you will have to were them for diffrent amounts of time.

ydow56Ekaa	I have lost several pounds in the last couple weeks by combining a healthy diet with exercise 3 times per week and Acai.    Acai is an awesome health food, in fact you will probably feel the difference in your body within a week of taking a daily acai supplement. So, why is it so good?    Acai berries have far more antioxidants than any other fruit. Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.    Acai can also be a great weight loss aid. The berrys natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that youd like to lose.    The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.    Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.    My friend at work showed me this website where she ordered her Acai berry from. It's a great deal and there is even a free trial offer, check it out!    http://www.news-pulse.com|`|PFXUdEl9aa	2 points|`|TFfgskH0aa	I can help you do just that.

I had these problems too before I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. It's not normally tested for, and the blood test isn't really right most of the time.

It sounds to me like there is something or someone that is really bothering you. Clearing up any mental inharmony will help to rid yourself of illness as they are more often than not the cause. I would try some form of meditation to free yourself from anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy resentment or any other strong negative emotions that are making your body weaker.

6205283364bce5bf761e31dbab2a3426aa	I just had to get a baby tooth pulled last week!!   I was so nervvous && everyone said it wasn't goin to hurt && it didn't lol  but all the dentist does is hold some numbing cream on there && then he gives you the needle like every 3 min && after the first time you cant feel it at all  On the pain scale i would give it a 1   The only weird thing is you can hear it when he pulls the tooth [you cant feel it tho] nd it just sounds really weird|`|Ne1VawAeaa	same but i only have 2 babies left and one of which doesnt have another to grow in after it. and one of the like 3 teeth that were already pulled still hasnt come back.  most times it wasnt that bad. the last one was worst but i had my other tooth growing in above it and it was a bad area. thats the only real bad one. but its not too bad most of the time.   good luck!|`|RIcMWeSKaa	Dontttt worry! I have this phobia were I just could not pull out my teeth, I had about 15 pulled at my dentists.   They might put you to sleep if its that many, although it depends on the dentists. I had 6 done and I was awake.    The teeth pulled dont hurt. They use pliers, and you cant feel anything except for pressure, as if you pushed on your tooth, and then this terrible sound like a tree coming out of the ground and the roots are breaking.  The sound will make it hurt lol! :)    The shots dont hurt as long as your dentist goes slowly and surely. Just ask them to go slowly and you are kinda anxious, they will understand. They want to put you at ease anyway.  The shots just feel like... you bite your cheek but not as sharp. Just a little ping! sorta.    They will give you probably 2 to 3 depending on where the teeth are. They will make sure its numb and you might even be able to keep them and at my dentists office, watch tv!  Just relax and calm down if thats possible. it will really help a lot! Try just closing you eyes and thinking about something else, or talking a lot. :)|`|gNBO8M71aa	I had to do the same thing before i got my braces on. The shots are the only thing that hurt. And they don't even hurt that bad. Just feels like somebody's pinching there for a sec or two. Don't worry about it.|`|FkunZ9q4aa	If they numb you, it won't hurt during, but it'll be somewhat painful after.  Just have the tylenol ready!|`|6rAqu6alaa	Baby teeth (milk teeth/deciduous teeth/primary teeth) normally fall out when their permanent counterparts start pushing them out of the gums. The last baby teeth to go are the lower 2nd primary molars, they fall off at around 11-12 years old. There are instances that the baby teeth never fall off, it may be due to the permanent counterparts' lack of force to push them out, or because the permanent teeth never developed at all. The best way to confirm this is for the dentist to take an x-ray.     Pulling out baby teeth generally does not hurt, because baby teeth have shorter roots and that makes them less anchored to your jaw. An anesthetic solution will be injected near the tooth about to be pulled. You might feel the needle prick, or not notice it at all. The dentist is trained to make it as painless as possible, and once the anesthetic solution has taken effect, you might be surprised that your baby tooth has been pulled out without you feeling anything at all :)|`|f3fWgbpIaa	the **** is about 3 and the pulling is about 3|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	i was put to sleep when they pull them for me|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Not really it all depends though when my aunt pulled mine out it didn't hurt a bit|`|1d402c3504c05f460a6aa5b26b86dd52aa	most dentist are good about giving the shots to numb you up   if you need a scale amount it would be a 2

VCIZJQCJaa	it could be lots of things.all kids get sicknesses that start from the time you are a baby.,kids get sick when they start school because they are starting to socialize with new kids, lots of new germs,and your body has to build up strong against all the sickness,and sickness can make you stronger later in life.it was probably measles chicken pox, flu,fever etc.the medicine i'm guessing was antibiotic,as they taste yuk.you are still young and will get sick again from colds flu,etc.don't worry your other problem is not at all related.when you go get your school physical,tell the doctor just what you posted,and see if he can guess.o.k. don't worry parents are probably messing with you,as it upsets you|`|VgnZFA6Maa	did you ask a doctor?
TqBpKMbcaa	Hi Katrina- you may be just starting to get your first period if you haven't gotten it yet. Have you learned about this yet from  your mom or in school? Headaches and cramps are normal symptoms. You should talk to your mom about it, but if you can't for some reason, go to your school nurse and tell her what has been happening. You probably don't have stomach cancer and are really just getting normal symptoms of growing up. I will say a little prayer that you will feel better soon.|`|ij8riyMwaa	Just because your stomach aches doesn't mean you have stomach cancer.  You could just have intestinal problems with digesting or something. If you are getting your period you usually get stomach cramps/headaches. If it is really bothering you just get it checked out. It could just be a small infection for all I know.
oGZs64FLaa	i got it early
OfQwVhD2aa	I think that you should go to your doctor, because it  sounds like you  have an infected wound on your knee.  Any wound that is infected will have a puss coming out of the wound.  I don't mean to scare you .but you need to go see your doctor asap.|`|KBBonf97aa	On shallow abrasions, it is common for the wound to "weep" clear or nearly clear liquid.  It would be best to clean the injury with hydrogen peroxide twice a day to kill all the germs.  If you apply some Neosporin with Pain Relief to it before applying a Band-Aid, the area will stay soft and the scab won't be so bad.  Plus, it will heal quickly if you keep it soft and covered.  Nothing like a tumble to ruin a good run, eh?  Good luck!|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	pus is an immune response to any bacteria that have gotten into the wound.  clean it every day with an antiseptic (like iodine or peroxide) and keep it covered with a bandage and antibiotic ointment while you are sleeping of wearing pants.   it would be good to allow it to be exposed to air though as much as possible because it will decrease some of the bacteria.  if it starts to turn green, has a foul odor or seems like it's getting worse you may need antibiotics. i wouldn't wait more than a few more days for it ti start to look better...
iMryjx0Yaa	It is only a means of describing potency. Depending on the leaf that the company uses, its relative multiplicities of the leaf.    1g of Salvia= 1g of Salvia  1g 5x Salvia= 5g of Salvia  1g 10x Salvia= 10g of Salvia  1g 20x Salvia= 20g of Salvia  ....so on and so on......|`|29maScwJaa	All that you need to know is..the higher the number, the stronger the concentration of salvia. I did 10x once and it blew me away, not in a good way either lol I dont suggest smoking anything above 10x... lol|`|ft4t22Deaa	I am going to assume that you mean the homeopathic remedy of salvia.    The numbers are potencies.    Potency means the number of times the original ppure sample of salvia has been diluted with a alcohol/water mix ( standard homeopathic preparation ) therefore a 5x potency has more salvia in it than a 60x potency.    The higher the number does not mean that it is a stronger concentration, but it does mean that it will have a stonger effect.    The fundamental principle of Homeopathy is that the more times the original substance has been diluted the more effective it will be.    I hold a Diploma in Homeopathy.
nksewi03aa	From a physiological point of view, no, you will not experience any permanent effects from keeping your eyes shut for a week.  You may experience irritation to either a small or great degree, because the blink reflex is how the eye washes away debris.    People in comas have kept their eyes shut for years, only to wake up and take only a day to readjust to light.    When your eyes are closed, the muscles that control your iris relax. It may take them a short while to learn to control the amount of light they let into your eyes.  Kind of the same way your legs would be a little shaky if you didn't walk on them for a week.|`|cpnT5Wqwaa	um, im not sure but it doesnt sound like a good idea to me|`|jDjUj5HZaa	You'd probably have blurry eye vision for a while, but take a shower afterwards, and the blur will go away! And everything might look a little smaller or bigger to you for a while, until you get used to it.|`|dBoC8fR2aa	Make sure when you open your blindfold after a week of darkness, slowly, preferably in a very dim room to let you accustom to the light before venturing into a brighter light.
NMMYw8WDaa	It will help  but if you vary the intensity of your cardio (walk fast for half an hour, sprint for  5 minutes, walk fast for another half hour) then it would greatly improve your caloric distribution|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Buy a pedometer and use it to count your steps on the treadmill.  The goal is 10,000 steps per day.  This will help you keep track of how much walking you are doing per day.  Don't forget to eat healthy also.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	yep. walking is great cardio workout.   but in order to loose weight, make sure you're eating healthy too. you don't need to diet, just make healthy choices and drink plenty of water.  cutting portion sizes is a good idea too
nksewi03aa	First of all, don't let anyone run the water in that sink. There is a SLIGHT chance you could still find them.    Under the sink is a "U" shaped pipe called a trap.  This pipe is there to catch things that fall down the drain.  You can undo his trap if you are handy and check it for your contact lenses.  The reason that there is only a slight chance they are there is that contacts are only slightly denser than water, and if the water was running they have likely been forced through the trap.    Even if you find them, you will likely need to replace your lenses.  The trap is full of bacteria, hair, gunk, all sorts of things. Even if you clean them well, the chances are they have fine scratches on them now. These scratches are just like a cut on your knuckle, they are only on the surface and don't go all the way through.  Every time the contact bends slightly  from the action of your eye blinking, the scatch in the  lens open and close quickly, essentially pinching your eye slightly, leading to irritation.    Your parents care for you much more than you think.  Explain what happened, promise you will be more careful, and they will likely brow-beat you a bit, but will replace these MEDICAL devices for you. (stress the MEDICAL device part to them).|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I don't think you can get it back. You should get those 30-days soft Lens where you can wear a pair till they are broken. Naturally, your parent will be annoyed at your loosing the lens, because they need to find money to replace one for you. So just be extremely careful next time. Let this be a lesson for you.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	There is probably nothing you can do, they are probably washed down the drain and on their way to the sewer.  Even if they are caught in the drain trap and you pull the drain apart and find them, they will be very contaminated.  You will need new contacts, try to figure out how you can do enough chores/part-time job to pay for them.    Next time, close the drain if you plan on rinsing them in the sink again.

Although, you need more sources to get the proper antioxidants to fight all the free radicals.|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|Gx1CbI56aa	If it is a good quality acai berry product, then yes, it is worth it. Acai is the best known antioxidant fruit that is known on the planet. The antioxidants in acai help to cleanse your body. The natural lipids in acai help to give you more energy and stamina. The fiber in acai helps digestion and fat loss.    I've been using acai berry products for a couple of months now and I've noticed that yes they do work. I used them when I wanted to trim off about 15lbs.    I knew that diet and exercise alone would help achieve that goal alone but I needed something to help me with my mid afternoon snacking urges. This is where I found the acai berry really helped me.    It helped to curb those mid afternoon urges which meant when I went out jogging later that night I wasn't just jogging to work off that bag of Doritios I snacked on around 3pm instead I was actually working off the weight I wanted..    After a couple months I now no longer needed the supplements and can manage my weight more easily, so I found that yes they really did help speed up my weight loss goals when I used them along with a diet and exercise program, as the berries gave me more energy and helped to curb my appetite    I got my free trial bottle from the site below|`|biknsMtGaa	Maybe its better if you read some testimonials from the customers first.

5zTI9G3Taa	Something like:    When you fell over and scraped your knee you got some dirt in it. Some of the dirt you could see and some of it you couldn't. The bits that you could see were all cleaned out but a few of the ones that are sooo tiny you can't even see them got left behind. You're body is helping to clean them out. It sends lots of little soldier blood cells to the place where the dirt is and they fight to get rid of the dirt and germs. It is a hard battle and some of the soldier cells must die to win the battle, that pus you see? That is all the little soldier cells that went to fight the battle for you.     Anything more complicated and you just get in to a whole mess of questions and explanations.
4z0Rk4Ddaa	Hope this helps.       Approximately one in 31 people in the US are carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene. These people are not affected by the disease and usually do not know that they are carriers.    Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease. This means that CF is inherited. A person will be born with CF only if two CF genes are inherited - one from the mother and one from the father. A person who has only one CF gene is healthy and said to be a "carrier" of the disease. A carrier has an increased chance of having a child with CF. This type of inheritance is called "autosomal recessive." "Autosomal" means that the gene is on one of the first 22 pairs of chromosomes which do not determine gender, so that the disease equally affects males and females. "Recessive" means that two copies of the gene, one inherited from each parent, are necessary to have the condition. Once parents have had a child with CF, there is a one in four, or 25 percent chance with each subsequent pregnancy, for another child to be born with CF. This means that there is a three out of four, or 75 percent chance, for another child to not have CF.  The birth of a child with CF is often a total surprise to a family, since most of the time (in eight out of 10 families) there is no previous family history of CF. Many autosomal recessive conditions occur this way. Since both parents are healthy, they had no prior knowledge that they carried the gene, nor that they passed the gene to the pregnancy at the same time.    Genes are founds on structures in the cells of our body called chromosomes. There are normally 46 total, or 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell of our body. The seventh pair of chromosomes contains a gene called the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator) gene. Mutations or errors in this gene are what cause CF. This gene is quite large and complex. Over 1,000 different mutations in this gene have been found which cause CF.    The risk for having a mutation in the gene for CF depends on your ethnic background (for persons without a family history of CF|`|AA10004006	The Cystic Fibrosis gene must be present in *both* parents before a child can inherit the disease.    So, you can carry the gene but unless both of your parents had it, you will not get the disease.    Mike Honeycutt

TsjqzanQaa	First of all, semen and sperm aren't poisonous.    Next, they don't go into your stomach.    Semen and sperm are partially reabsorbed, and the rest goes out with ejaculations or wet dreams.    If semen was harmful in the stomach, both men and women would have died from performing oral sex on men; this doesn't happen.    If you don't masturbate or ejaculate, the sperm doesn't leave the body in the usual way, and it builds up and irritates the prostate.    That's why it's healthy to have regular ejaculations, either through sex or masturbation.       It also relieves sexual tension.    It doesn't go into your stomach, and even if it did, it would cause no harm or noticeable effects whatsoever.    Sometimes people can misinterpret basic facts, and this is what happened to you, and you have an odd idea that semen is somehow harmful and that it can get to your stomach from your genitals, which doesn't happen.    Relax, it is indeed all in your head.        Try to read up more on the reproductive system and how it works, and perhaps you will finally realize that there's absolutely nothing for you to worry about.    Good luck to you.

However, you should collect some of the spit that you claim has sperm. Then go to a lab and ask to have it checked.

No sperm comes out of your mouth, ever, unless you happen to be a straight female or a gay male and spit not swallow.       Your own sperm does NOT "enter" the stomach -- the two channels are not related.  Sperm cannot and would not damage organs in the abdomen, nor does it nor could it cause nausea.    2.  The doctors are physically correct -- there is NOTHING wrong with you.  You are incorrect if you say that there is nothing mentally wrong.  I seriously suggest that your immediate remedy is to acknowledge that you have some mental damage from your upbringing.  GO TO A DOCTOR WHO IS A PSYCHIATRIST.  I am sure that the condition is CURABLE with treatment.  You cannot cure a physical condition because NONE CAN EXIST due to the things you are saying -- so please, get help for the actual condition that can exist.    3.  No, the idea of sex, masturbation, sperm -- HUMANITY in no way disgusts me, I am sorry that people in your life when you were younger were disgusted by such NORMAL AND HEALTHY things, and as a result damaged you.

So once you see blood, wipe the blood away and put either toothpaste or an acne cleanser.|`|PGJKLZCVaa	thats what i heard.. i use t-tree oil soap, it clears my face in like 2 days|`|woxz5TrDaa	I've never used toothpaste, but people swear by it. Lemon juice really works great, better than I expected. It tightens the skin, which makes the pores smaller, so less dirt and oil get in there, so less breakouts. Once at night, wipe your face down with lemon juice from a bottle- real lemon juice, and don't wash it off, just go to sleep with it on. Rinse you face in the morning, Try it once a night. Don't over-do it, it'll dry out your face. It also works for other parts of the body if you break out in multiple places.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	Yep,  put it on before bed. Wake up in the morning, and it's gone.   Or, put peroxide on them, pop them. Then put neosporin on it.|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	No it does not this is an urban myth!

SG27rfSdaa	It's not healthy to be around that violent hot headedness  what if one day he hit you. have you talked to him, does he say he would never hit you and just likes to hit things?    He could turn out to be -in the long run if you marry him- really controlling and scary.    It's a red flag.    Be careful.    I've been around people who hit things and it's scary.

Don't get in over your head ok?|`|1EhbLBkUaa	What are you asking for help with?     Changing him to make him over into who you want him to be?    Making your friends see the man you want him to be?  ... Have you considered that who they see is just as valid as the man you see?    It's very, very common for women to fall for a "bad boy" and say they're the only one who sees the real man inside; something about that makes them feel special... they're the only one who he shows that side for, or they are the only one to understand him, or they're the only one who can calm him, etc.  Unfortunately, the bad boy persona is still their "main" personality, and doesn't go away.    Or are you worrying that if you do manage to change him to keep him from blowing up so inappropriately, that he'll stop being so sweet and romantic afterwards, since he won't need to apologize for his outbursts?    Or, are you worried at all -- likely very deep down -- that he'll only get worse, and become physically abusive?  He is borderline abusive already; this is likely why your police family don't like him -- they see this pattern far too much: the one pushing the line farther and farther, and the other making excuse after excuse, until the abuser does something unforgiveable.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	When you are older,  you will understand that you cannot fix other people.

AA11091233	I'll tell you tomorrow.          Sorry..........lol?      Write a list of the things you need to do. Writing it down gets it out of your head swirling and twirling around.    The best way is to take each item and break it down into tiny pieces. So if you need to clean your closer for instance'    Monday....open the closet door  Tuesday....get boxes or bags ready  Wednesday...Spend 5 minutes only doing something in there, whether it is hanging up clothes or just standing there deciding what you want to do. Stop after 5 minutes. Seriously.  Thursday...spend 10 minutes ...stop afer 10 min    Almost guaranteed..by the time you do that and get started, you will get in a whirl wind and finish it.    It also helps to enlist a friend or family member to check in with you...    Honestly...best bet is to write it down then break it into tiny pieces...once you start, you will be amazed and realize that is actually take TONS more energy procrastinating that actually doing the deed.    I know it sounds easier than I am saying...but it;s not...I get it.     Good luck!|`|AA10824931	You can only do one thing at a time, so, go do it!

23d301972b7aa34f0dee311075c3c233aa	We can't answer this question unless we know exactly what your reading was.  It very well could have been higher than your boyfriend's father's because he may be on insulin or oral medications to keep his sugar low.  In that case, it was probably normal, especially considering it was a random test and you weren't fasting.|`|AA11727191	Can you give us a specific number of how high it was? What was the actual reading?|`|hf4hbCHnaa	blood sugar can run high for a number of reasons. How long had it been since you ate? it can take a non-diabetic two hours for blood sugar to return to normal, depending on what you ate. Stress (good or bad) can cause blood sugar to rise, illness can cause a rise, not sure about period.|`|Lor20kXcaa	11 and 9.7 are a little elevated, but not abnormally so.  It was probably just a peak after eating.    It's gone down, which means you don;t have type 1.  You don't have any of the risk fators for type 2, so i'd say it's very very unlikely.
OBaP0Hf3aa	No. You're just behind when it comes to growing. At your age, you probably haven't hit puberty yet, and if you have, you're definitely at the beginning of it. Your body will catch up to you, don't worry.    If you want to help it get started, eat a lot of protein and not a lot of fatty foods, so when you do gain weight, it'll be muscle, not fat.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	You're very thin.

I am 26 and still have no cleavage, at your age I had no breasts at all, I didn't start developing until my late teens to early twenties - very annoying as all my friends were early bloomers with massive breasts! Youre just being self-conscious, also very normal at your age, it's normal for your breasts to act that way where they look smaller out of a bra than in one. I recommend taking a look at photos of real breasts online to compare (you're probably used to seeing breasts on models, we all are, it gives us a warped idea of how we should look), look at tubular breasts which [no offence to ladies who have them] dont exactly look like conventional breast shapes, we all come in different shapes and sizes and thats all good  youre normal hun :o)|`|U8QQkeQ4aa	I know what this is like.    I wear a 38DD but if not wearing a bra my breasts seem to go out than in leaving me with no cleavage.

That is not the fault of your breasts, but of the bras!
v2HWSwc8aa	As a person who is prone to blockages due to Crohn's disease, YES, it is very serious. You need to go to the ER so they can do a STAT xray, lab work, hook you up to an IV to get fluids in you as well as anti nausea and pain medication.    The bowel can expand to the size of a basketball and if left untreated, can burst and cause serious serious complications, even death.    If caught in time and given the proper management protocol, the outcome is very good.    I learned all of this from attending an education seminar from the CCFA and there were surgeons, GI doctors, and an RN who works with IBD pts.|`|db524db56c5160b98e42222b3203b4bcaa	I agree with Common Sense.  I also have Crohns Disease.  I started out the same way.  Rushed to the doctor and found that my colon had perforated. Had 3 feet of my intestine removed, my right colon, and my appendix.  This is not something to play with. Please go see your doctor rite away.|`|B24W8w43aa	Yes. You need to see a doctor.|`|43V1pN2Taa	very much so|`|0arBtMruaa	It may not be a blockage, you may just be constipated in general. That would cause those side affects. Go to the a pharmacy store and get an over the counter laxative and see if that works.|`|abae6afaf05cd4433e382fc342911d20aa	Yes, it is very serious and can become life threatening if not treated or if the person with the condition waits too long to receive treatment.

If it's the last week than it doesn't matter. If it's another week, I recommend you call your local pharmacist (CVS or any pharmacy will counsel you over the phone).    Personally, I would just continue my pills tomorrow as normal (taking Wednesday's at your scheduled time). You'll be protected still, but if you're worried you can use a condom for the rest of the month. And when it's time for your period, it will come a day earlier than usual. You can resume your normal schedule next month.
AA12218624	honestly, i don't believe in fad diets or most diets out there because most of them are just crap. if you just try to replace junk food with health foods and pick up some extra activities to do like running or swimming you will most likely lose weight. try replacing all pop with water. replace all white breads and pastas for wheat ones. instead of eating a bag of chips for a snack try eating an apple or two. also, try upping your fiber intake. this will make you feel full and less likely to reach for that doughnut.     as for exercise, instead of parking your car in the front of the parking lot park it in the back and walk. instead of taking the elevator take the stairs. try walking even 10 minutes everyday and increase the amount every week or so.    and remember this is something you must commit to for life. it's not like an old sweater that you can just get rid of whenever you want. if you want to be healthy, you have to be in it for the long haul but in the end it will be worth it.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	Fad diets don't work... If you are overweight in the first place, then "fad dieting" means you are changing your diet around for a month or more with the goal of losing weight.  So, as soon as you lose weight and you're happy, you go back to your old habits and gain it back.     The only real way to lose weight and get a great body forever is to change your diet forever.  As long as you can cut out the bad stuff (saturated fats and sugars) and eat in moderation, you're setting yourself up for a healthy diet for the rest of your life.      If you want more detail on how to do it, check out this free book: http://www.dietspy.com/simple-weight-los...|`|fIEmi84Laa	The Scarsdale Diet.  It says you can lose 20 pounds in 2 weeks and it does not lie.  (Not true in every case, though.)    Unfortunately, every time I finished it I went back to my old habits. My cousin lost 80 pounds and has kept them off. Right now, I'm just trying to focus on eating less and eating healthier, because if I continue to take diet pills and go on diets, I'll never lose weight. Diets suck. I think whoever has problems trying to gain weight should go on a diet, because that's the only thing they're good for.|`|uC0xTgkeaa	if you can stick to them, yes, otherwise you will only end up gaining weight.    however, instead of dieting, make healthy choices that will last a lifetime.    you can still eat junk food, just in moderation.   eg.   instead of a 20 oz pop, maybe just a can.  instead of a med. fries, a small fries  instead of a big mac, just a cheeseburger    if icecream now, no cookie later    get the idea?|`|SgOVFseaaa	No, they don't.  Diets will only make you fat.  If you go on a diet and lose weight, some of what you lose will be muscle.  However, as soon as you go off the diet, you will gain everything back in the form of fat.  In the end, you will have more fat and less muscle than when you started.    The only solution is to develop an eating plan for life that you enjoy.  Start a new lifestyle instead of dieting.|`|fmr98EBtaa	Yes, diets can work, but unless you stick to the diet for the rest of your life you will gain the weight right back. You shouldn't look at it as a diet, so much as a healthy life change. A healthier lifestyle that can continue with you in the future.
m4MZkhZxaa	yes there are many many treatments but you have to know the right one's. try neutrogena. but all you have to do is search on this website and go to 'search for question' box and type in something along the lines of what's the best acne scar treatment and see which answer you think is the best|`|SmOr0awmaa	my mom told me cocoa butter lotion helps rejuvinate the skin and reduce scarring.  aslo vitam E while its still healing gets rid of scarring
SpL2MPDraa	First off, it's dextromethorphan, lol    This is a problem waaaay too many DXM users have problems with. I'd say your best bet (if you dont mind drinking syrup) is Robitussin Max Strength Cough (which is the same as CVS Max Strength Tussin). It's 15mg for every 5ml dose. Meaning that a 4oz bottle has 354 mg, and an 8oz has 708mg. So if you're taking smaller doses, then an 8oz bottle should get you 2 or 3 trips.    If you can't do syrups, then I recommend Robitussin Cough Gels, or a generic equivalent.    Happy Tripping!|`|k24zcshxaa	Arrgh I'll probably go to hell for this, but look for the Robitussin gelcaps or comparable store brand. Usually about 15mg/pill and nothing else to give you a stroke or whatnot.    Note: If you plan to use these for something other than stopping a cough, which I suspect based on the way you phrased the question, please do your research first. I recommend dextroverse because it is a decent site with no overt propaganda for either side. Just know the pros and cons before you get involved with this stuff, please for the sake of the kittens! ;)|`|L1qVELDsaa	Robo 8 hour cough gels are your best bet.  There is also a throat spray that just hit the market a few months ago.  I think zicam.  robo is the better choice because at 300mg, it gives a stage 2 experience.  zicam is about 580mg and will make you go insane for a bit.    Heres some caution:  300mg @ 200 lbs has a good chance to make you very sick.  Be warned you will probably throw up and there is no nice way to say this, but you'll probably need access to a bathroom for a good half hour.  After that you can bask in your itchy afterglow.|`|SmVwFTpgaa	short answer is 100% dxm powder.    all syrups will have binders, sweeteners, stabilisers , food dyes etc..as well as other active ingrediants that you want to stay clear of.    check out the link below.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Cardio is one of the best ways to burn boy fat, sorry. You won't build too much muscle by waking and running if you're already a dancer.    Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|NNSVSXdYaa	First, let me start by saying it's "lose" not "loose".

It doesn't sound like much, but I can assure you I lost a LOT of weight!!    Also, cut out all soft drinks, sugar, candy, etc. Drink a lot of water and watch your fat intake. Don't eat fast food either! I assure you that if you do those things you will lose weight quickly.

Everyone has hemorrhoids and they only become a problem when they are inflamed or swollen. Hemorrhoids can last for years, and unfortunately they usually get worse as time goes by. Hemorrhoids can be very painful for some people and can occur inside or outside of the anal canal.    Hope this helps.

CuVnpxh3aa	It is called palpitations and they are from the heart. Everyone has them but not everyone feels them. I have them all the time. They are usually caused from stress and are not serious. Once you relax they will stop. The more you think about them, the more you have them because you may not think so but they worry you because you don't know what they are. You only have to worry is if you get pain with them and the pain doesn't stop. Nothing to worry about.|`|6DloIDomaa	it is probably arrhythmia......no need to worry....its just  an irregular heart beat...i rarely occurs....but its nothing to worry about..its a  normal thing....that happens rarely...|`|77fc3780b9d69d2c882b5780bdc8549caa	It could just be a muscle spasm

Are you a drug addict? It is highly addictive and dangerous if abused, and if you're buying it from random people sounds like you're going to abuse it.

If you need hydrocodone - it must be prescribed by a medical doctor. Therefore your medical insurance would kick in to either cover the expense or your co-pay will apply.

Everyone that says $6 and $7 a pill is incorrect.  It should be about $2.75 to $4.00 depending on the strength.  I highly suggest that if you need pain killers, go to your doctor.  You have no idea what you are getting on the street, they could be selling you aspirin for all you know.  I hope I helped.  Good luck!
69SHxWA9aa	Here is a video clip on how they treat it in Japan.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...    It is fairly easy to treat, if you find a source for the water. You can also rinse your hair with the 5.5 PH water, it will make it smother, and tangle free.    You can get the water in home based water processors.  Do a search on Craigslist.org for 8.5PH water or place a wanted add for 8.5 PH drinking water - used in the video, and many times the same machine can make the 2.5 PH water at the same time.      Good Luck !|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Try herbal remedies from serenaskin.com, it's natural, no steroids, and works for my scalp psoriasis better than anything I've tried before.   I used ointment and spray to clear the scalp and now take anti-psoriasis extract to prevent flare-ups. My scalp is clean for more than a year now.|`|owM5PK5Iaa	i wish i culd help u but idk what dat is|`|iYG6lLbVaa	the only way i eased my psoriasis on my head was to keep my hair short and spend some time in the sun,good luck.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	Scalp psoriasis is a completely different type of psoriasis then regular psoriasis.  Have you gone to a doctor about it yet.  If it's not going away with the regular shampoos you may need something stronger, perhaps one of the cortizone or non-cortizone creams that are available with a perscription that can work wonders on some people, or some heavier shampoo.    What I have is a different kind of psoriasis and I can tell you what has worked for me, but can't guarantee that it will work for you.  I did go through a series of laser treatments to get rid of the psorosis before I tried this herbal treatment and it has worked for me for about 2 years.    I use these herbs twice a day, and it took about 2 months before I noticed that it was working.  I take 2 or 3 pills in the morning and at night of  green tea extract and Burdact (sp) root.  you can also add drinking extra green tea which can help.  It's worked for me, with the addition of some creams from a dermatologist as this is a drying concotion.  I would use tea tree oil on my hair if I were you and if you do, definetly follow up with a conditioner.  Kheil's makes the best tea tree shampoo, but not cheap, but your head is the only one you have.
5zTI9G3Taa	Sorry, there really isn't any medication that can help you.     About the only thing you can have done is have your legs broken and put in to metal cages. Every day you turn a screw a quarter of a turn which slowly moves apart the healing area of bone forcing new bone to grow. This is an incredibly painful and long procedure which normally results in only a couple of inches growth, scars on your legs, risk of infection and frequently causes repeated broken legs following the procedure as a result of the weakened bone.|`|OaQWUfNoaa	I agree with heels- get yourself a pair of pumps or stillettos...But seriously, the only way to get taller is to use stilts...but that will take some practise....just be happy with the height you are.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	drink milk|`|9iXGakohaa	You can't, sorry. Sometimes taking yoga can help lengthen your spine   (not noticeably), and sitting properly will help you look taller, but there is no way to actually make yourself taller.|`|Ne1VawAeaa	heels|`|OBaP0Hf3aa	I hate to burst your bubble, but it's pretty much impossible. The only possible way (and I don't recommend this - it sounds pretty painful) is to break your legs and stretch them. Don't do that.    Make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D so your bones are strong enough to grow, if you're gonna grow anymore. If you're a girl, get used to wearing high heeled shoes.    At 18, you might be done growing. If you're parents are short, you're pretty much destined to be short. Sorry!|`|i9MlY6J3aa	1) Wait to grow. 2) Drink lots of milk and do yoga. 3) WQhy the hell do you wanna be tall! Being short is awesome!!!|`|2XkRkKIzaa	oo i know YOU WAIT
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It definitely sounds like you have started your first period.  You need to tell your Mom so she can get you some pads and answer your questions.    It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.    welcome to womanhood..|`|v7W8yBP7aa	you are going to start your period soon congrats!|`|1nC4fVw3aa	peoples period often turns brown after a couple of days of having..i shouldn't be to worried|`|1YcKHGLqaa	It's called spotting.

You should probably ask someone you know like your mom or if you have an older sister.|`|11Vgs45Naa	I think for your height, 75 pounds could be way too light, but then again, sometimes body fat has no role in it. Maybe! Brown discharge IS a warning sign.|`|2ry5l60Vaa	you're on your period. yeah, its brown but that happens to everybody the blood inst always going to be red red like in movies. you NEVER know what to expect.|`|v5aXYWonaa	OH man.

But masterbation after puberty cant affect anything.
u7o75zipaa	I like Nivea Visage Young Moisturiser. It smells nice and really hydrates my skin.    If you have dry skin, it's worth checking out Vaseline Intensive Moisturise (comes in a pale yellow bottle). My mum has really dry skin around her eyes, but this really worked for her.    Astral is another you can try. It's really cheap, and supposed to be very effective.    Hope this helps.x|`|d77e08f79b80ca282637c03b94d35e2eaa	I use Niviva Soft, its reasonable and does a good job x|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	You don't give a price budget, but remember that some moisturisers are cheap and will last you one month, some are 3 times the cost and will last you 3 times the time.    Your skin can get used to products if you use them daily for years, you do need to chop and change about once every few years or so.    I have very very dry skin (get many white patches of dry skin on my t-zone and cheeks feel tight) I use Orgins, Nuxe Dermalogica or Neils Yard. They are all pricey, around the 15 mark or more for 50mls, but in each case, they will last me about 3 months. I have used Simple, which though was easy to use (not as good with my dry skin though) but was all used up- all 100mls of it! within a month. So it pays to use something which is value for money.    I would advise Dermalogica for learning about your skin, they teach you how to look after your skin and their products are really mild but effective. So many products are just full of serum and additives like perfume, which through feel good to use, wont do your skin any good in the long term.|`|84crzC80aa	Vaseline intensive care essential moisture for dry skin    Its really really good, I can't remember the exact price but I know it was under 5.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	I sometimes wonder if there really is a big difference between moisturizers, but I have good skin and nothing seems to make a difference, so I'm going on the advice of friends.  On place you should not skimp is the cost of skin cream.  Even if it costs more than you wanted to spend it's worth it in the long run, or so my friends tell me.  I know I have been using Kheil's skin cream for years and wouldn't change.  They have a cheaper line that made me very happy.  It has an SPF 15.  They now have an upgraded line that comes in little brown jars and boy do I feel the difference, but the cost is way more, but actually, you use so much less that in the long run I'm not sure which comes out cheaper.  If you buy a top line moisturizer you use a tiny bit and it lasts forever.  If you buy something cheap, you need a lot to cover your face.  Kheil's has a site on line and you can look at the products if they don't sell them near you.  But, I swear by all their products, shampoos, soap for shaving my legs, face scrubs, whatever.  So, I suggest, give them a try.|`|or6A1Indaa	E45  is the best moisturizer  without a doubt. Its non-greas aswell so your not rubbing grease on your skin.
QLZQtUH4aa	I know my voice is still like alittle kid I hate it when I listen to it on videos. But I can reach pretty good notes on singing I just can't hold them  though. Try singing.
Su0O55W8aa	I unfortunately have had chlamydia and you are not supposed to have sex for at least 2 weeks after treatment (preferbly after the 2nd check!)  You are not cured right when you take the pills because they have to have time to get into your blood stream and kill the disease.  Next time try going to your local Health Department, they have specialists that work in the sexual health area.  Best bet too is to go back 2 weeks after getting tested, they told me 2 weeks because you have to have time for the medicine to get in and get rid of everything in order to get a positive reading!  Yes..sex that soon was a huge mistake, so of course you need to be tested again!    Don't believe me..read this!  http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/c...    PLEASE use protection from now on!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Chlamydia is a parasite.  It is killed in the presence of the medication in your blood, unlike a bacterial infection which takes days to respond to antibiotics.  Two different animals.    However, you need to have your male counterpart treated as well, because couples pass it back and forth to each other, so both need to be treated.|`|zhhvSykHaa	Don't sorry. you are safe.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Doctors know best. So yeah if she said treatment works immediately, your ok.|`|BgFf4S85aa	You are not "Safe" at all. I take it you were not using protection? Were you with the same partner? If not, then there is definitely a chance for further cross contamination. Additionally, if Oral contact was involved, sometimes some of the traditional treatments don't work.    Wanna be safe? Have all your partners checked out, and "WRAP THAT RASCAL!"|`|KLGtR4vqaa	ahh..if you took Azithromycin then it takes 19hours for it to begin attackin the bacteria but docs say wait a week for you to have sex and drink but its better if you wait like 2 as the anti biotics take 16-17days to offically be out your system. Get another test just in case but you would kinda know as you'd still be experiencing some of the sypmtoms  hope this helps somehow|`|MTY1soXWaa	must NO SEX for a week till got rid of Chlamydia, if u had sex at same time, then u could still have Chlamydia, won't go away|`|kNPyJ1tcaa	it's okey...  dunt worry..

Psychologically, it's only a problem when it begins to interfere with his day to day functioning. However, as far as your relationship goes, it's a problem if YOU feel it is a problem.

It is fornication which is a sin if he's a Christian.  Porn can become an addiction.|`|WTf0caplaa	Wow, you girls just don't understand men.    Just as you have your hormonal issues, this is one of man's. I don't think you have anything to worry about (unless he's looking at kiddy porn or animal porn... but even then...). As long as he's able to engage in his daily activities--work, kids, you--at a productive rate, then don't worry about how much porn he does or doesn't look at.|`|XGHLrOklaa	Yeah I kinda agree with the first person any is too much for me.  If it's bothering you and interfering with your sex life then it's time to talk to him.  Sounds like he may have an addiction and it can get worse. I mean really when is too much too much. How much money is he spending on it. I know this guy who is married and he spends his families vacation money on porn. It's a very unhealthy habit in my opinion and I wouldn't tolerate it.  I don't think my husband looks at it at all if he does he hides it well, and I'm a very good seeker.|`|oWP2DjJoaa	I think that is either a sign that     1. The sexy time you two spend together is not good enough for him. He would rather jerk off. Or its boring him, no longer interesting. Try some new things.   2. He no longer has any interest in you. Possibly cheating.     Have a talk with him. Ask him.     Is it just recently that this is happening or have it been forever? If its recent then something is wrong. If forever then nothings wrong.     Hope that helps. Good luck .    Though i think that is a bit too much. Every chance he gets? Would it be like 3-4 times a day? more? Though as much as he jerks off, he will keep makin sperm, don't worry abt that. lol .|`|0MUwB3Czaa	Warning this is just my two cents that's all.    Just like other habits that can be addictive if it is ruining his family life, obsessive even he takes time away from hobbies, work, and family it maybe a problem.  Not saying Porn is good or bad but if he feels he needs to look at it six days a week instead of being with you it sounds like a problem.  He needs to respect you too so if it is troubling you you both need to work it out.  Good Luck          http://yourmetamorphosis.blogspot.com/|`|YCPgsvV9aa	Its just a man thing, leave him alone but dont give much attention. He'll start to notice and realize that its the wheeooo that's making it happen. Just stop by his computer when you see him, and just stand there then walk off tssking him. If that doesnt work, you could always IP the sites he goes to, then ban it :3 but 6 times a week is a little over "off the edge".    Its good to be paranoid. :)|`|T0ALtDw7aa	I would say that when it starts to intrude into your normal life, it's becoming too much. Maybe you should ask him to be honest and see if there's anything in your guy's personal life you could change. But you have to be ready to handle what he says and really consider his suggestions.|`|MaKjKOogaa	Give him the occasional licky licky then fry his banana.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	I think porn is OK. I dont think you should listen to these people when they say no porn is good..blah blah.    You obviously dont mind as you said you watch it sometimes.    I think 6 days a week and every chance he gets is maybe a little too much. Maybe you should speak to him and ask him why?     Some men find it more pleasurable to satisfy themselves rather than have their wife or girlfriend do it.    I dont know. You best bet is to speak to him.|`|ue6RDTXaaa	ok  apparently your husband watches because either  A. He is bored with his sex life.  B. He wants to bring some of the fanasies from the porn.  C. He is addicted to porn.|`|AA12272543	I would think too much.|`|VTHscx1aaa	It's not abnormal at all. He may just be highly sexually charged. It's natural for a man to want think about, watch or want to have sex on a regular basis, and not everyone has as high of a sex drive to one another.    While it might seem like he watches porn more than other men in similar circumstances, I'm sure so long as it is not affecting the relationship between you and him, or any other aspects of his life.    If he was doing it for any reason that should be making you paranoid, surely he wouldn't just be watching porn. As i said, so long as you it doesn't interfere with his and your relationship in a negative way, it doesn't matter how much he watches it.    If it really does bother you, ask him the reasons why he likes to watch it so much, just be honest, and tell him it bothers you a bit and makes you a little uneasy as to the reasons for him doing so. Do not pressure him to stop doing it, but voice your concerns, if he cares enough for you he will probably cut down a little anyway, and if he doesn't he will probably at least give you some answers that put your mind at ease.|`|TlGRW65faa	ehhh hes a guy give him moreee he wont need 2.!!|`|ElAy3yQBaa	i would have that much if i could ,he ll get enough soon though|`|FF4nWQmqaa	U know when you watched too much porn when you fall asleep watching it....try asking him why he likes it so much maybe he want to try new moves in the bedroom or maybe he jus like watching other people have sex..
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you are going for your first pap smear, it is uncomfortable but not painful. They will take your blood pressure and weigh you. Then they will ask you lots of questions about your health and when your last period was. Then they have you put on a paper gown and get ready for the doctor. When the doctor comes in he may ask some questions about your health. He will discreetly check your breasts for lumps. There will always be a nurse or lady in the room with you and if there isn't and you want one, ask. Then they will put your feet in stirrups with your legs open and he will put two fingers into your vagina and push on your ovaries to check them. Then they will insert a speculum into your vagina and take a long q-tip and take a sample from your cervix. It doesn't hurt but is a little uncomfortable. Sometimes they will put a gloved finger into your anus to check to see that everything is okay there. Then it is over.    During the procedure, the doctor will probably talk to you about your life or family and try to keep your mind off what he is doing. If you try hard to relax and take deep breaths, it is less uncomfortable.     Don't be embarrassed, it is nothing compared to giving birth and being in labor, when it seems everyone is checking your vagina.    best wishes..|`|4qvvHTGLaa	well i think they have to swab ya, just dont get an orgasm when the male gyn was doing it, it felt so good and i couldnt hold it in! lol|`|v7W8yBP7aa	they will have you take off your pants and underwear and do a pap smear and you will have a towel/blanket over your legs which will be open  - its not that bad dont worry! hope this helps =)|`|Q27cXlGbaa	yeah. youll be in a gown and they look in your vagina. its not as awkward as it sounds. its what they do, its like looking at hands for them.|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	I went in for my first pap smear this afternoon. They ask you a few questions then they allow you to ask any questions you may have. They step out of the room allowing you to completely undress but leave a gown so you can put on. They tell you to sit on the table thingy and have you scoot your behind to the very end with your legs spread open on the stirrups. It wasn't so bad a little embarrasing, but not bad at all and very quick. You will be fine. They do use a speculum...here's some more info on this site below.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	A doctor has to write the prescription...just get over your discomfort....|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you are going to have a pap smear, you will need to see a doctor not a nurse.  You could ask in advance to see a female doctor when you make your appointment.      best wishes..|`|nUu7tUiqaa	Yes, as a patient you have a right to choose who you speak to. However, a nurse cannot prescribe you anything, as they do not have the authority to do so. You will have to ask an MD for your pills. Just ask if you can speak to a female doctor or nurse practitioner in your doctor's office. The doctor will have no problem letting you speak to someone else.|`|60mDEusiaa	Yes, but unless you're getting an exam, I don't see why you'd need a female one.|`|a12cbnR4aa	The doctor will have to prescribe the bc. And you will probably have to have a pap-smear done when he puts you on the bc. That will have to be done by the doctor. You could always seek a female or have your doctor refer you to a female doctor.

It means that you're teeth are generally in the place they should be, now they just need to be alligned which is what the bands do. The more you wear the bands the quicker the time will come till when you can get them off!|`|OndtnxEzaa	yes my mom is a dental hygienist and when i got my rubber bands it was only four months till i was braces free! i had them for two years also.

I've had mine for 6 months and was told by my orthodontist I would have them for about 2 years. I'm getting elastics on Monday.|`|X9XYf7Jxaa	yes usually there are two parts of the braces process, sometimes three    1) removing of teeth (this is usually not the case)  2) braces are applied to fix the positions of the teeth  3) rubberbands are applied to fix the position of the remaining displaced teeth.|`|nYEkkNn2aa	when you say rubber bands do you mean the things that you put on your upper and lower jaw then yes. you might need a couple more tightening of wire unless your done you should ask your orthodontist if and when your done.

PEw6Z3mEaa	In testing to see if someone has recently used pot, there are two important substances to keep in mind: THC and 9-carboxy-THC. 9-carboxy-THC is a product of the body's metabolism of THC and, more importantly, it is detectable for a longer period of time than THC is detectable. This is the reason that drug tests, namely urine tests, look for 9-carboxy-THC.          Blood Tests  Urine Tests      Frequent Users*  4 - 8 hours (THC)  2 or more weeks (9-carboxy) 2 weeks  1 month?  ( 9-carboxy-THC.)    Infrequent Users**  3 - 4 hours(THC)  2 - 3 days( 9-carboxy) Up to 10 days  (9-carboxy-THC.)      The range is based on how high your metabolism is and your weight.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com

vUQFiU7Oaa	Well there are different types of scoliosis surgery.  They can go in through the back making an incision down your spine (i think this is more common)  or in my case, they went in through my side.  They cut out a few of my ribs and deflated my lung on the left side so they could go through.  I dont know the details but my scar starts about three or four inches from my belly button and follows in the direction of my ribs.  it wraps around my side and back. its like a foot to a foot and a half long (im not good at guessing measurements).  It is pretty long but since i had a good surgeon who took his time when stitching me up, it is faded almost completely.  Its been 4 years since my surgery.  Oh and ribs grow back.  Sorry i don't know much about the other kind.  I can tell you more about what it was like if you want to know.  Just email me at livlafluv58@yahoo.com   Best wishes!    Oh, and i was in the hospital i think for a week.  They wouldn't let me leave until i could walk down the hall and up a few stairs.  Its not easy but you can do it.  I was out of school for around 5 months.  i walked with help from my family but didn't get out of bed much for a while.  and you can't see any rod or feel it through your skin|`|c68nVKIYaa	It sounds like you are under what the orthopedists call "observation" -- they are waiting to see if your scoliosis will get worse. If you are still in your growth period (11-14 or so) they would normally prescribe a body brace to slow or stop curve progression. Look into the Rigo-Cheneau brace, which is reputed to be about the best for teens. There are orthotists on both US coasts who make them.    I would avoid surgery if you can, because for the rest of your life you will have a stiff spine and there is a significant risk of complications. (Like 15-25% of patients.) And yes, you will have a scar on your spine from neck to to tailbone. Many people have to have two or three subsequent surgeries to fix what went wrong in the first one. It's heartbreaking to read their stories of constant pain, I've seen an awful lot of these.    It is rarely "necessary" to have spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis. The doctor may recommend it, but be aware that the doctor makes a *huge* fee (as high as $30,000 to $60,000) for the operation, which could influence his recommendation. He will claim that there is no viable alternative to surgery, and that exercises don't work, but the book below by Dr Hawes proves this false.    Look into the Schroth method of physiotherapy for scoliosis. This has been around for almost 90 years in Germany, and you can find Schroth clinics in the US now if you search yahoo for Schroth method. Basically it will strengthen weak muscles in your back and stretch the tight ones to elongate your spine and correct your posture. It's work, but you keep your natural spinal mobility.|`|8WYWEDOpaa	Your muscles are moved away from your spine, discs are removed, and rods are attached.  This happens only for the levels that are to be fused.  The rods are bent enough to straighten your spine but not too much.  How much correction you get depends on how flexible you are.  Correcting too much can cause paralysis so if that happens, the doctor puts a little more curve back.  Then bone from your hip or perhaps cadaver bone is put in which helps the fusion process.    You're most likely to have a scar down the middle of your back, but depending on your spine, a minimally invasive procedure could be used.  I wouldn't count on it, though.    You'll be walking before you leave the hospital.  You'll even be able to climb stairs before leaving.    You can't see the rods through the skin.    I differ with renlute on several points.  1. Doctors do not operate solely for their fee.  In fact, I've known of several that have not operated because it was the right thing to do.  2.  It is a very rare case that has a scar from the neck to the tailbone.  3. I don't have figures, but I seriously doubt that 15-25% of fusions have significant problems.  4. I also seriously doubt that many patients need 2 to 3 more operations to fix what has gone wrong, especially since things very rarely go wrong.    Spine fusion, as a treatment for scoliosis, has been studied for many years.  Many research paper have been published on all aspects of the surgery, recovery, how well it worked, etc.  If you have the operation, you are going to get a very well known treatment.  Also, scoliosis specialists are very well trained.    I don't mind renlute recommending the Schroth method, but (s)he doesn't have to lie or exagerate about surgical methods.    I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.    Let me talk about the hospital stay.    You'll have meds to help with the pain. You'll start out with stronger meds and then wean yourself from them over time. So, yes, it does hurt, but you shouldn't be left hurting.    The size of your scar depends on how many vertebrae need fusing and the technique used to do the fusion. A four-level fusion will have a smaller scar than a 12-level fusion. Some surgeries (probably not yours) need both anterior and posterior (A/P, or front and back). Lastly, some people may be candidates for "minimally invasive" techniques. So, this is a hard question to answer without knowing more about your situation.    Your hospital stay will probably be between four and seven days. Teens typically heal quicker than adults and so their hospital stay is less.    As for what they do, each case is different. Here's one possible scenerio. Its incomplete as I'm describing things pretty quickly. The amount of time spent doing things will probably differ. Maybe even the order that things are done will differ. But it will give you kind of an idea of what happens. Just take it with a grain of salt.    You'll arrive at the hospital early to check in. You'll change into your gown and get an IV hooked up. You will talk to your nurse(s) and perhaps a couple of other staff members. You'll then get put to sleep (injected through the IV that you had put in earlier). The operation then happens. You'll wake up, probably in the ICU, but possibly in your hospital room. Probably on the first or second day after surgery, you'll be shown how to sit and then stand. You'll be able to take walks up and down the hallway but you'll tire quickly. Your IV will be removed in a couple of days as will the catheter you've had in you since the surgery. You'll be allowed to go home once your stomach starts rumbling, you're eating, and going to the bathroom. When you are in the hospital, your scar will be checked by a doctor each day.    You will feel like a truck ran you over for the first couple of days. Once your body starts to recover, you'll feel better.    When you wake up from surgery, your bed will have a machine that gives measured doses of pain meds (morphine or something as effective). You're self-medicating, so if you're hurting, just hit a button. The machine won't let you overdose yourself, though.    You'll be weaned off of the meds from the machine and given oxycontin (or the like). This is what you'll be taking for the first few weeks you're at home.    Bottom line is that you'll be hurting, but you'll be given pain meds to take care of the pain. They'll do the job for you.    It still takes two months to be doing basic things. You'll be cleared to do more things at six months. At one year, you'll be able to do about anything you could do before the surgery. Take it easy. This is major surgery. It takes a while for the spine to fuse.    There's a couple of things, off-topic, that will make life easier for you.     o Make sure you has a robe in case you gets up in the middle of the night when the house is colder. The surgery may mess up your body's temperature control.    o Get a toilet seat extender so that you don't have to squat as far. These also have handles and certainly made my life a lot easier. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.    o It might be nice to get a "grabber" which will help you pick things up from the floor.    o You may or may not have a walker when you get home from the hospital (probably not, but...). I did and discovered that I had to meneuver through the bathroom door sideways because the walker was too wide. This works, but it may be a bit more difficult.    o You will be sleeping an awful lot. This is a combination of your body needing rest and the pain meds knocking you out. Expect it.    o When I was in my bed, my wife made kind of a "nest" with pillows so I wouldn't roll
tDaU7eYXaa	There is only one way of REALLY knowing. You MUST do this before it's too late. Just go to the doctors. They will swab your throat and analyze if there are any germs on it. Sounds gross, but eh...... whatever. I ALWAYS gag when they stick it down my throat. YUCK! Oh WEll... For now, just drink medicine for the symptoms and rest. Thats basically all you can do....    ; )|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	If this has gone on for more than five days I would suggest you see a doctor because it could well be strep and you will need treatment. No one here will know exactly what is wrong only your doctor can tell you that so make an appointment as soon as possible. Hope you feel better real soon.|`|p8yphpjYaa	If there are little white patches in the back of your throat then it's probably strep. If not, give it a few days, drink LOTS of liquids, and use Chloroseptic spray. Advil can help with the pain, and reduce inflammation which may make you feel lots better.
mFZeEm9paa	You are right, all men should trim, especially if they enoy a good BJ.. anyways, my boyfriend just uses clippers and doesn't go all the way to the skin, that helps him. Now for us girls who need a clean shave, the itching goes away eventually. When you first start it is really bad, to the point where you think, I am never going to do that again, but after a few weeks of sticking to it, all of the itching and razor burning will go away. I can shave myslef, and not have it itch or get bumpy ever just because the skin down there has built up a tolerance and I usually only use soap or the shaving cream I use on my legs... Nothing special.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	cus they are not waving around freely. They are pointing straight up which makes them feels itchy or pointy.|`|MaKjKOogaa	Trim? Or completely shave?  Trim..idk.

Additionally, if the hairs are very short, they are rigid, and will have more strength to jab with, rather than bending.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Hair provides a cushion against abrasion.|`|bVuqLJjJaa	I don't trim them, sorry|`|1EhbLBkUaa	When they grow naturally, the tip of the hair is worn down into a nubbly point.  When you shave, that soft tip is sliced off, turning the end flat with sharp edges.  These little tiny sharp edges are what itch so.  This is why stubble is uncomfortable until it grows out and wears down a little.  Some people wax instead, so that the edges are worn again by the time they emerge through the skin; but that hurts like all getout in the process, and you have to wait for it to grow out enough to wax again.

Ectn7tkSaa	Well I am the same as you even though I hear many times that people when they worry they tend to eat more.  It is not a sign of anorexia as anorexia is not eating because you are worried about getting fat not because you are stressed over something.  What you could try and do is eat many small light meals which is better than nothing.  maybe a milkshake, a light sandwich, toast or even things you really like like ice cream, chocolate etc until you feel less worried and can eat better.  You could also visit your doctor who could prescribe anti anxiety medication if this is an ongoing concern of your as you can't eat an unbalanced diet for long without long term effects.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Nayh. I'm the same way. When I worry or fret, I won't touch anything until I cheer up again. I try to notice and force myself to nibble, but I've always found de-stressing is the better method. Take a long bath or shower and give yourself some chill time :)|`|nUu7tUiqaa	Anorexia would be something that you would purposely do, it isn't a side effect of something. You have to make an effort not to eat in an attempt to lose weight. This is likely just a symptom of stress, as chemicals in the brain released when you constantly worry can depress another part of your system that tells you to feel hunger. Just force yourself to eat 5 small meals a day. That way you will not feel like you are forcing yourself to eat a lot, and this can help to regulate your mood.|`|sGWVQcQmaa	I have the same problem!  WHen i get really stressed out i loose my apetite and I am not at all aneorexic.  I just try to eat whatever appeals to me even if its a bowl of icecream for lunch.  you cant be skipping like 2 meals a day because your body needs some calories.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	That is strange.  I know in order to find your due date, you back up three months from your last period and then add 7 days.  So you should be due about Aug. 8, 2009.  Maybe you weren't pregnant until the next month or your ovulation was really off.  That is a big difference and you should discuss it with your doctor when you go back.      good luck..
s0HTHGd4aa	Go to a mom and pop pharmacy.  Pay cash and be prepared to show your ID.  You should be good.  I've done it w/ other meds.|`|Z0SiMz7daa	A previous answer said not to go to a chain pharmacy.  If you had the last one filled at a Walgreen's their computer system will show when the previous one was filled.  Be sure not to take acetaminophen (tylenol) at the same time you are taking the Lortab since acetaminophen is an ingredient in the medication along with Hydrocodone.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	That's kind of risky to do.  You run the risk of not getting it filled at all.      Don't take it to any of the major chains - CVS, Walgreens, etc.  Try to go to an independent.       And you're still going to have to show ID, so be prepared for that.

5I7Ifrmraa	Tell one of her parents. Where is she getting drugs that are not prescribed? and what is she taking? Its very dangerous to take prescription drugs if they are not prescribed by a doc.  I am sure you already knew this.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Don't tell the police.  Tell her parents anonymously or something.  What is she taking?  Oxycodone?  Klonopin?|`|VLjJCBO7aa	its called a rehabilitation center. take her to one. if she doesnt want to tel her the negative effects of taking drugs. then if she still refuses just say if you want to die, die then, and leave|`|W9B6EJrWaa	You need to confront her, and tell her you love her and that you are worried about her.  Try to find out where she's getting her pills, and try to find out how much she takes, and how often.  Try to find out WHAT she's taking, and NEVER EVER let her drink when she takes them, if you can at all help it.     Yes, you can become addicted to prescription medications, like xanax, or valium, or hydrocodone.      And yes, you can die, ESPECIALLY if you drink when taking them, which it seems a lot of people do.      If you drink when you take the medications I just described, your breathing becomes so slow and shallow that you basically just smother.  You stop breathing.      You can also become unconscious and vomit, and suck some of your vomit into your lungs, and choke to death.      Happens all the time.      Confront her, if you can, and ask her if she wants to get some help for her problem.  Chances are very good that she will have to go into treatment, because getting off tranquilizers or narcotics is physically very painful, and most people don't know how to taper themselves off slowly.      This is a huge problem in our community, and yes people really do die from it.|`|ycNt74yyaa	What kind of drug???|`|Ts33DJSwaa	telling the police probably wont help her, you need to educate her on the subject of drugs and drug taking, check out:    www.uniteagainstdrugs.com    that will help you to help her...|`|iZt0FSbYaa	I think you should talk to her about it first before you talk to anyone else. If she lies or gets defensive, then speak to one of her parents. And see what they suggest to be done, because they need to take care of her. Good luck!|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Telling the police would be dumb.  Do you hate your friend or something?  And telling her parents is also dumb.  Maybe not as dumb, but they're HER parents, and if she wants them to know then she will tell them.  If you really don't like her doing them, tell her in person.  If it is truly getting in the way of your friendship and she doesn't want to stop, then make new friends.  But let her do what she wants.  If it doesn't get in the way of your friendship, then don't worry about it.  She probably won't die from it.  Just because the word drug has a bad connotation doesn't mean they're all deadly.  But find out what it is that she's taking and how much she's taking, and then come back here and tell us.  But more likely than not, it is not deadly.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	I agree...try it, and if it doesn't work, take him off of it...usuallly, the meds work really well...nothing else will help...|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	Without question I would start behavioral therapy with your son before doing anything else.  I do not care what any physician says, they really have no determination of long term effects these medications may have on a child.  These types of medications have not been around long enough for these studies to be done with accuracy, and there really is no way of testing them unless you want to allow your child to be a guinea pig and see what happens.  I would question the diagnosis in the first place.  He is a five year old boy.  Need I say more?  Have you ever met a five year old boy that isn't hyperactive?  My nephews can't sit still long enough to consider it sitting.  I do understand that there are children that have a harder time concentrating as long as others, or staying focused, or even following directions as easily as others do, but doctors and teachers are all too quick to want to label it as ADD or ADHD.  That is why behavioral therapy may help.  The therapist could work with your child on trying to stay focused longer, follow directions etc.  I would not ever consider anymore than that.  I think diagnosing a five year old with anything further from a cold is a bit premature.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Discipline.  At home.  At school.  No meds.

There are several studies that show children improve when you remove gluten and casein (milk) from their diet. I'll give you the link to one. I personally do a gluten free diet for other reasons and it's changed my life. I had ADD as a child, although there wasn't really a name for it back then.    Sarah: are you okay? You're not thinking of hurting yourself are you?|`|NBpIM9paaa	Okay well I do not have a child of my own, but i have had PLENTY of experiences with ADHD medicine.     First of all, medicine is a big no-no for most people. I have been on 2 different kinds and they both basically killed my personality, and everything that made me me. NO matter how many times they changed the dosages the outcome was always the same,and theyre STILL trying to get me to try it AGAIN. now have they ever felt what it's like? no. They don't know. Now i do know of a few success stories but in the long-stretch there are more disastrous stories. A typical day for me was like this....I always concentrated on my school work. I didnt care about anything at all but school school school. That would be good but It totally killed my social life. Even in group activities i preferred to work alone. I never talked, I NEVER had an appetite which caused me to go wayyyyy underweight. I acted like a complete zombie. I couldn't sleep either. My mind was always running, trying to think of more things to do or work on. I felt so organized it drove me crazy and none of my friends liked me anymore. Those were the side effects for both adderall and Focalin XR.    so think about it...do you want your kid to be a zombie, only living so he can work work work, or do you want him to be a playful kid with friends, and a few problems wiht school, but nothing he cant work out if he tries the best he can?    I know this is a hard decision for you, but to tell you the truth, i think it would be best if you don't make him go through what i went through. I'm still going through many problems but most of it doesn't even have to do with ADHD. Im at the ending point of my life right now, but before i go, i just want to save your child from having to deal with all of that.    just reall consider it,plese?    hope i helped    -sarah w.|`|BGrIKjTEaa	im 16,and i have adhd im on strattera and risperdal  for me it truly helps in school and helps me stay calm also i have made a lot more friends now.  i would give him the meds, he will thank you later in life

She tells lies about me and other people and lies about herself. She is a very intelligent person but uses her intelligence to hurt others. She can make you believe almost anything. You need to get help so you will not turn out like this other person. I know she sees a therapist but they haven't helped her at all from what I can see. Hey she may even have them fooled. This other person is a monster and you would not believe how many people she has hurt with her lies.

Compulsive lying is most definitely a mental health problem, and should be dealt with by a professional.

043fd49ed24f3c53dace2353445a5442aa	Stephanie is correct - there is no such thing as 14. The quantitative viral load test can't read below 100 viral copies per milliliter.     So that either means she had a viral load of 14,000 or log 14, which is 14 million. 14 thousand is very low, and log 14 is really high.|`|AA10213842	14 million? A viral load of 14 is never heard of.

6z8DgOu1aa	Although you gave us a lot of symptoms you have lacked on a couple...one question is, what colour is your mucus? If it is a yellow-brown-green color different from normal you have a bacterial infection that has probably effected your stomach area as well. Another possibility is that you have the stomach flu; resulting in discoloration of the tongue, extremely upset stomach i.e. throwing up all the time, and in turn, through the vomit, dehydration. The symptom of loss of balance, shaking and not wanting to stand up or being able to stand up for very long for that matter, are symptoms of dehydration, so please keep drinking water, or you will faint. The weight that you have lost as well is associated with dehydration, water holds weight, so the result of throwing up is losing weight.People who are also very dehydrated have very bad headaches, so please please please drink some water even if you don't want too. when you are feeling better eat something as well. Depending upon the color of your mucus, if it is the brown-yellow-green colour go to your doctor and get a prescription for antibiotics, because you have a bacterial infection which will not go away on its own for a couple of weeks. If your mucus is normal coloured you probably have the stomach flu which will go away in your case in a few days. All I can suggest from this point is to rest for regeneration and drink a lot of water to hydrate. your symptoms will decrease with water, so drink. get well soon.|`|MGvN5xrNaa	You could have strep throat.

You just have a better sense of the future (psychic, whatever you wanna all it).  I also have the talking thing too a little bit, but that sort of thing mostly happens in movie type things.  like, i'll predict weird things that happen in the movie.

DExj3XQYaa	Well, i got contacts when i was in 4th grade (im a junior in high school now) and to be honest, at a young age, they're a hassle. Your mom is right about the risk, but for the most part,its a small percentage youll leave them in long enough for them to get stuck. However, contacts are a big responsibility, and if you're just getting them to have green eyes, I would say to wait until you're older. Every night, you have clean them extensively, worry about them falling out, and be cautious about eye infections. Also, its a strain on your eyes after long time wear.     Basic Use: you put the contact, after cleaning them, on your finger, keep your eyes open, and stick your finger close enough to your eye for the contact to grab on. The first time will most likely be an adventure, but as you get more experienced, it will get easier      P.S. after having contacts for almost 6 full years, i switched back to glasses and am really happy i did|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I am a wearer of contact for more than 20 years, never have these problems that you have been frightened about. They are safe. Maybe your mum's friend is a very careless person to have a torn piece of contact stuck up inside the eye ball. If s/he were to use eye solution in a little cup provided, s/he would be able to wash the little piece of contact lens out without going to such an extent of see a doctor. Talk to the optician and let him explain the consequence for wearing contacts, instead of guessing the bad part of wearing a contact.

9l9dmp6faa	That doesn't sound normal.  You should definitely make an appointment with your doctor to have something like that checked out.  Do you hear 'wheezing' sounds when you breath, if so it could be asthma.  Do you cough a lot and produce mucus and have fevers, then it could be and infection of your airways (bronchitis).  These are only a couple of the minor things that it can be.  But you should have a doctor check it out.  It is better to be safe than sorry.
icZARsMtaa	So, you're confirming that you are in fact anorexic?     I can tell you, from experience, it's not a disorder that you can't rid yourself from, just because you're tired of having it. It's a continuous, daily struggle.    A few options if you want to get better are therapy, counseling, or rehab. They all have different names, but are essentially the same on some level.      EDIT: These people that answered are obviously idiots and completely ignorant to the illness. "Eating a cheeseburger" isn't a cure. ******* morons.    EDIT: Okay, I just read your additional details. You want to gain weight, but are unsure how. Honestly, you're probably fine where you're at. If you insist, to please yourself and mom, though, I can tell you that it may be harder than you think.

Anorexia, if indeed you have it, is typically not something you just shrug off.  It is a very strong impulse which overrides your body's basic urge to eat more food.  Overriding a basic urge doesn't come easily, so don't expect that changing that pattern will come easily.    Honestly, therapy *is* probably your best solution if you really are anorexic.  You got yourself here on your own, you may not be the best person to guide yourself out, you know?  I'd suggest you give it a go.  You don't have to do group therapy, one-on-one could work just fine.  But I would start with a medical doctor and go from there.    If you're a girl, you should probably be eating at least 1500 Calories a day.|`|pCP3u5uaaa	Well, I am not personally sure how much you weigh. If you aren't  anorexic, your mother may be telling you that to make herself feel better about her own weight.     If you actually may be anorexic, here is a women's average height to weight ratio. If you are 10-15 pounds thinner than this, then you are anorexic.    5' 0" 97-127   5' 1" 100-132   5' 2" 103-136   5' 3" 107-140   5' 4" 110-145   5' 5" 113-149   5' 6" 117-154   5' 7" 121-159   5' 8" 124-164   5' 9" 128-168   5' 10" 132-173   5' 11" 135-178   6' 0"  139-183         Now, if you actually are anorexic I would recommend a baby step "anti diet plan". On day one of this plan, measure how many calories you eat a day. The average for a women is 2000 calories. Lets say you normally eat 1000 a day. Increase your average calorie count about 100 more a week until you reach 2000 a week. Then, continue eating about 2000 calories a day (with regular exercise).

There is no simple solution to this. Get help. I hope, for your health (both physical and psychological), you do.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	talk to someone who had this problem before and is better now, talk to a mature friend who's much older then you and trustworthy, start to plan your meals to hit a total of 1600 calories a day so you can begin to gain weight, read a book about this, call kids help phone(which is anonymous), and finally seek professional help or group as last resort if nothing else seems to be working! Don't try to fight it on your own because you may not be strong enough or mature enough to succeed if you take this path and your success rate will be slashed by more than half leading to an ultimate failure and relapse. Anorexia is a disease and diseases need help just like all serious addictions and diseases this should be taken seriously and not lightly!|`|X3j8kFF0aa	First you need to know that there is something wrong. You also need to know you problem is that you think you look fat. But people see you as a stick. Then you need to start eating foods that you know will help you gain weight. But don't over eat. It could lead into something different. I had to tell this to someone I used to know.|`|PHY2vd6baa	okay it depends on your height and weight mostly.... however you could have a super high metabolism which would explain why you are so skinny. do you work out or do sports? if you do, running especially or any kind of cardio work out, plus your high metabolism  will result in your  lack of weight. eat foods with tons of carbohydrates!!! like breads and pastas...you'll gain weight and get tons of energy!!!
a12cbnR4aa	First of all I would like to say congrats for being a cancer survivor at such a young age, or any age for that matter. You should consider consulting a dietitian.

2f33210399c03b3166e4e868697b9157aa	Bronchitis can be acute or chronic, which means it can be in one episode, or it can be for many years.    Chronic Bronchitis is what smokers can contract; but you DO NOT have this - you do not smoke and it is not chronic and is not caused (in this case) by cigarrette smoke!    Acute Bronchitis is what YOU have - it is caused by a bacterial or viral infection that enters the airway and causes inflammation of the bronchi which are the cannals in the lungs that spread air throughout the lungs from the airway. The cause the bronchi to create more mucus and therefore you have a cough.     With appropriate antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin, azithromycin or more seriously ampicillin, etc) you will be fine and it will recover.   You can also be given albuterol to open your airways and dextromorphan or codeine for the coughing.    Don't worry it will go away in at most 10 days and is caused by a virus or bacteria - you didn't do anything to cause it! Just take any prescribed anitbiotics.|`|C60j5rhtaa	You can get it if your Bronchi because stuffed up with tar from chemicals or smoke...|`|hjcHkNSfaa	Bronchitis is when the thin mucous lining of the airways can become irritated and swollen. The cells that make up this lining may leak fluids in response to the inflammation. Coughing is a reflex that works to clear secretions from the lungs. Often the discomfort of a severe cough leads you to seek medical treatment. Bronchitis occurs most often during the cold and flu season, usually coupled with an upper respiratory infection. Bronchitis also can occur when you inhale irritating fumes or dusts. Chemical solvents and smoke, including tobacco smoke, have been linked to acute bronchitis. People at increased risk both of getting bronchitis and of having more severe symptoms include the elderly, those with weakened immune systems, smokers, and anyone with repeated exposure to lung irritants. Several viruses cause bronchitis, including influenza A and B, commonly referred to as "the flu."    I hope this helped!  - ? Forever -  -RissieBear?
p8yphpjYaa	Probably do a skin allergy test, in which the doctor will determine what kinds of foods/environmental things you should be tested for to see if you are in fact allergic to any of them. He/she will put a tiny needle soaked in the allergen into your skin, either on your forearms or your back with just a tiny prick and then you have to wait for about 10 minutes or so to see if your skin swells and itches, which indicates you are allergic to that thing. Your doctor will write them all down, marking severity of the allergy, and then you will know what things you need to stay away from, or he can make a serum combining all the things you are allergic to and start allergy shots, usually done twice a week, then once a week, then sometimes once a month for an extended period of time, to help build up your immunity to that allergen, that way you won't have a reaction or at least as severe a reaction to that allergy source.

OpduZC3Eaa	You're mom is probably right. Most girls don't get an even cycle going until later on. In fact it's most common when teens have abnormal cycles. If you're really concerned then I suggest you take up this with your doctor. Tests could be done in order to put your mind at ease. In my opinion though I think you will be just fine and this is your body's way of finding it's own natural rhythm.|`|uavC9WsEaa	What if your pregnant?|`|D2IapzLtaa	It's probably just some irregular periods.

T0m0gZAtaa	Brush your skin with a loofah or skin brush when you shower to stimulate circulation.    Massage cocoa butter into the stretch marks.    Use vitamin E oil on your stretch marks. Massage it into your skin after a shower.    Talk to your doctor about using tretinoin cream on stretch marks. It is available by prescription only.    Eat foods high in vitamins A, E and C (see Related eHows), or take supplements in addition to your diet. However, pregnant women should avoid taking more than 25,000 IU of vitamin A.    Add foods or supplements to your diet that are high in zinc (see Related eHow), which is good for the skin, and silica (beets, brown rice, bell peppers, soybeans, leafy green vegetables and whole grains), which helps form collagen, the supporting fibers in the skin.|`|tajEz5Efaa	Well, stretch marks are scars and will never completely fade. You can, however minimize their appearance with many over the counter products that are available. I used Bio-Oil and it help tremendously. You can buy this at Walgreen's. It is a good idea to keep your skin moisturized to help prevent any future marks. Hope this helps.
AA10006931	There's no special way of doing it, other than being careful to not break either pair of frames or lenses. Depending on the sunglasses, you might need a small screwdriver to get the lenses out. If they're plastic frames, though, they usually need to be heated to expand things until they're flexible enough to let the lens out. We use a special heating device; presumably you could warm the plastic over the stove if you're careful.  The bottom line, as you've already identified, is making sure that the lenses do fit -- no sense taking apart both sets of glasses and doing all the work to avoid breaking anything, just to find out it won't work and you have to put it all back together again!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I don't think you are able to do that even though you thought that they fit. Why don't you buy a set of Mojave lenses where they give you a 2 frames and 6 pairs of sunglasses to suit every conditions. I am using that with satisfaction and they are light too. Very good.
0D4q4Q2Raa	90% of teens with ADHD don't have ADHD and are simply overly hyperactive. The doctors prescribe you Ritalin because it's easier than trying to explain to your parent that there is nothing wrong with you.

Qh2rc1DNaa	What to Expect    Session lasts 45-70 minutes for an adult, 20-40 minutes for children.    During the session a variety of techniques are used:        * sustained pressure by thumbs, hands, elbows, knees, and feet      * whole body stretching; arms, legs, torso, and the combination of all      * joint rotations and manipulation for increased mobility, range of movement, and improved posture      * fascia release techniques      * cranio sacral techniques      * central channel release    The session is traditionally performed on the floor on the futon mat. During the Shiatsu treatments the client remains fully clothed. It is best to wear loose fitting pants and a short/long sleeve T-shirt. Please bring a pair of clean cotton socks to wear.    How is shiatsu different from a massage?  Shiatsu works directly with the sympathetic nervous system via the tsubos (points along the meridians). By applying pressure to these points deeper levels of the body can be reached. The pressure on the particular points affects specific organs and their functions.      How to get most from your session:        * give yourself an extra time before and after the session to avoid rush      * do not eat at least an hour before the treatment      * drink plenty of water after the treatment      * allow yourself to have rather empty schedule after the treatment so that you can remain in the relaxed state as long as possible      * wear loose, comfortable clothing; bring along an extra pair of socks    To get the most benefit fromt he treatment it is recommended not to engage in conversation with the practitioner. Nevetheless, feel free to express any concerns or sensations you happen to experience during the session. Your feedback is always appreciated and informs the practitioner of the progress of the therapy.
KH93cYp0aa	If you think you may need stitches, get to the doctor's office/ hospital as soon as possible. After 24 hours, they won't give you stitches, and you could be left with a worse scar.

39x9tNJzaa	I think it crosses most peoples' minds once in a while.  As long as you don't become preoccupied with it, it's not a recurring thought or idea, and you have no intentions to follow through, then there's probably nothing wrong.  If you find yourself thinking about it a lot, though, you may want to talk to your doctor.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Yeah if your not always focused on it its fine I've thought about it before why not stuff crosses your mind doesn't mean you would ever do it or are thinking of doing it.

l5kKqvvFaa	Did the strep test come out positive or negative? Ive actually been home sick for the past two days. I've had a consistant fever for the past two days, my tonsils are so swollen that they are just about blocking my throat and I have a severe sore throat. I'm going to the doctor today because we think this is mono,strep, or simply a viral infection. You mentioned kanker sores, and I don't think that has to do with your sickness right now. If you have braces, you can get kanker sores from that. Symptoms of strep throat in children and adults include severe sudden sore throat without any cold symptoms, painful or difficult swallowing, fever over 101 degrees, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, white spots on the tonsils which are otherwise known as tonsil stones. Strep and mono can be mistaken for each other. Earlier signs of mono include a sevre sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, a whiteish coating on the tonsils. While you have mono, your spleen ( it is below your ribs on the left side) can become swollen and in very rare cases can rupture. The diffrences between strep and mono is as mono progresses, it is MUCH more severe and can only be cured by plenty of bedrest, while strep can easily be cured with anti-biotics. Strep also doesn't last nearly as long as mono too. Mono can have you out of school or work for a full month, and 6-8 weeks after you are better you can still feel tired and you cannot participate in straining activities because it can possibly rupture your spleen. Sorry for any typos in this I'm sitting in bed typing this on my iPhone haha. I hope this helped and feel better! -foxr1d3r40 :)|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	To be honest I am not sure what the sores on your gums can be..maybe symptoms of sore throat or strep.  Perhaps you should see your doctor again and ask him if he can advise you what to do about your gums..meanwhile gargling with salt water might help the sores.  Hopefully your test results will come back soon and prove negative for mono.  Hope you feel better soon.  good Luck
KAyVeRezaa	The dislocation may have weakened other ligaments and tendons in your elbow so make sure you follow the docs orders and keep a brace on. Your injury is not serious enough for surgery. It would actually take longer to heal if you went that route because you would need physical therapy afterwards. It could take anywhere from 1 week to a month to get back to lifting 50 lbs, but mostly depends on how strong of a person you already are.

KCiRI9K7aa	Human sexuality is a complex thing, every person feels differently about every aspect of sex. It is not clear cut, there is a lot of gray area.   So you can be moderately masochistic. There is nothing wrong with it, so you shouldn't feel scared about it. However it is very important that if you begin a relationship as a submissive, you should be aware of anything that could happen to you, be risk aware and safe.    check out these links  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe,_sane_...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-aware_...|`|39x9tNJzaa	Sexual preferences vary from person to person.  Some people are more dominant or submissive than others, some people like rough and painful, some people like a little, and some don't like it at all.  Some people like inflicting the pain, some like to recieve it.    In short, yes, it's possible to only by moderately masochistic.  I think, actually, that a lot of people who are into it are only moderately into it.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	That's like being "moderately pregnant". It'll grow.  Anything in the realm of addictive behavior has a natural progression.  Part of that is that the thrill you get from a "little" wanes until you need more to get the thrill. And that continues until that's ALL you want and even then the thrill diminishes. That's why addictions suck.
FkSONG6Maa	I have braces and are getting them off in March, Ive had them taken off before and have had a retainer as well so I know  a lot about them. Getting them put on takes a while and they will hurt after. There isn't really much dryness and they wont fall off as long as you follow the rules as to what you should not eat. As for colors, at my orthodontist, i change my colors every time I go which is once a month.The glue isnt to bad either if you can do the moldings then you wont gag with the glue. I hope this helped. And don't worry you will get used to them.|`|b8R5bPrhaa	There is one thing they put in your mouth that is very sour!  I wasn't to uncomfortable, except I had this stupid spit sucker that made cuts on my gums!|`|FDQFrP5haa	Don't worry too mcuh, the actual process isn't so bad. There's barely any pain, that only starts the next day. And they don't put too much in your mouth apart from the metal bits. There's no chance of you swallowing those since they glue them onto your teeth one by one. The only thing is the glue, which tastes awful, but they put cotton around the area while it's drying to help keep it out of your mouth. As for the dryness, I'm afraid there's not much you can do about that. Just try to stick it out, it won't take too long!  For colours, I find purple, teal, and pink look nice. Black and yellow make your teeth look dirty, and white stains easily, so don't get those.|`|JbGbU6guaa	Don't worry about swallowing them:                                       1- They are large                                       2- The orthodontists support the brace to make sure it is securely in your mouth.                      I went with red but I'd say blue or green are also nice.     WARNING: it may hurt for a couple of days especially when eating, but you will soon get used to them.|`|RIcMWeSKaa	Oh, I was SOOOO freaked out too!  They just put a jaw opener, no way you can swallow that thing. They dont really put anything you can swallow with the jaw thing, so its outta there.  You can hardly swallow, it blocks your tongue from everything.    As for the dryness, its only dry for a little while. You can swallow, and its not bone dry. Once they get the brackets on, they should give you water. They are veryyy nice, and just ask when/if you can get water, or make some kind of hand signal, and they will squirt you with water.  You get used to it after like the first 10 minutes, it wll be fine!    I like light colors or silver with mine, less noticable. For some, the purple fades to grey, but my first colors were purple and turquoise. :)|`|5QLQgLo7aa	Dont be scared.    you'll be fine.    i got braces on the 27th of jan.    and i thouqht it was qonna be bad but it really     wasnt. To me the time flew by really fast.    but after you qet them on they feel really weird     in your mouth. You'll qet used to them by day 7.    to me the cement has no taste, well i didnt taste     any. but after i qot my braces, they didnt hurt     they were just irratatinq me you may feel some discomfort too uhhghhh. But i     love havinq them. When they tell you to floss and     brush after every meal, please do so its so     important unless when you qet your braces off     your teeth will look really messed up cause of the     white spots. Umm as far as colors i got like a     dark purple && lime green. And if you have an     overbite depending on how deep it is, you will get     these little build up thinq on top of one of your flat(wisdom teeth)     teeth, one on each side. And thats to keep your    front teeth from bitinq off the bottom brackets.    Umm just eat soft foods for the first few     days. The discomfort for me went away on     the thrid day i had them.    Good luck.|`|5BOhn6Ubaa	ok it took then bout 45 mins to put mine one. ur mouth and lips will b dry so bring chapstick. that goes away in like an hour anyways. u wont choke on anything cause they barely put stuff in ur mouth. and they dont taste bad. ur just gonna b sore.    and for colors go wit wat holiday is close, sports teams, and school colors. and u can always mix and match sorta.|`|GoCVV7eNaa	Hey I'm getting braces in a while too.

prW1i0vzaa	Ooh, I hate those! I remember when I was younger I would get those all the time. Well, the playground I played on had this kind of gravel stuff on it.

Keep them clean.  IF you mean you got them from playing on the monkey bars then either wear gloves or don't go on the monkey bars|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	next time apply plaster..
q5e0PYqPaa	i have that same problem. i'll go up to this guy and talk to him and his friends are like 'ellie why is your face red?'  D:  its upsetting.|`|f101Liydaa	It's just you...if you have to hide your emotions or the real you for someone just because they make fun of you means they would end up hurting you in the long run and you're better than that and shouldn't go out with him.|`|XJMEnsoJaa	Save up your money and go for the GEMINI Laser. Your cosmetic Dermo Dr will know about this. Look it up, it helps with shrinking  blood vessels. No topical cream is going to help.|`|owM5PK5Iaa	well just take your time before going into it. try practicing.know what your going to say when your going to say it
5I7Ifrmraa	Crunches.  BTW-I am freaking sick of this GD question.  Look it up on google for gods sake!!!|`|K4zsztkRaa	Nope.  If you have any amount of fat over your stomach what so ever it might be pretty hard to get them. You would have to go on a hardcore low fat diet and at your age it's not healthy for you.  Just go a lot of crunches, if those don't work then just wait till you are older to do some hardcore diet.    -Connor|`|UbSh0Qvjaa	there is no such thing as the magical six pack.. it'll take 3-20 weeks depending on how hard you work and your current stomache.."flab"|`|PHY2vd6baa	okay dude here's what you need to do.... do crunches until you cant do crunches anymore....do them about everday and you will see results in at least 2-3 weeks... also remember if it doesnt start to show by then just keep doing them, building muscle takes time.  start off by doing 50 a day...do them as fast as you can... and try your best not to take breaks....also running and goiong to the gym help too. You want to build muscle in your other parts of your body to in order to evenly distribute the muscle.|`|lvoFDinyaa	i have this same question, if u get an answer that's good could u tell me. same goes with me too
K4zsztkRaa	Well if you have any amount of fat on your stomach what so ever, then working out won't get you tour abs. You have to go on a hardcore low fat diet. And at your age that's a health concern.  Just do crunches, if those don't work then when you are older you are going to have to hard core diet for them.      Abs are 98% diet and 2% work out.    -Connor|`|MaKjKOogaa	Why are you 5'7 and weight 125? That's insane.    I'm 5'8 155 and i'm seriously not fat at all.

Vhq3GURQaa	With the winter time cold everyone has heat on. This is extremely drying to your skin. Try using body lotion after a shower. Do not take extremely hot showers They dry also. Don't use strong soap. Something like Ivory or Dove is better  If you have a radiator style heating system put some pans of water on them to add moisture to the air. I assume you know for sure that you have not developed allergies to soap or clothes detergent etc. Good luck|`|mMkGDXioaa	Yah its pretty common it happens to me too|`|NjL6UlRwaa	actually it's pretty normal|`|uRvwLkIBaa	It may be caused by your laundry detergent.  Did you change detergent recently?
LJkPRqN0aa	know you are not alone. all kids your age think this way. go to a school counselor and talk to him/her you need to talk to someone. doing something violent or harmful to yourself is not that answer.|`|WoqKWkQaaa	you need to talk to someone.  this leads to worse stuff; don't let the rest of you're life be like this.  you're mom has to face the fact that you are really going through this.    edit:  noted, this is not puberty, seriously, find someone to talk to.|`|igkbUflbaa	Yea, that was me at 13 too. If you can't talk to your mom, because she won't believe you, then shes an idiot. No offense but you were going to realize that sometime eventually. Anyway, since you have the luxury of being in middle school you have counselors; these people aren't totally worthless, and they will be able to help you.  Don't hurt yourself, try to imagine a future where you aren't sad.|`|VK9tBggYaa	you need someone to talk to. if you dont have a friend to trust, talk to a counselor at school. everyone feels seriously depressed and sad at some point in their life. sorry you feel that way. but you need to tell someone and let it out and say how you feel. what if its a sickness or something!?? like bipolar disorder since you said its on and off..anyway my advice to you is to put it out in the open. you need helpppp . good luck|`|dV9YT8GDaa	Try not to allow those certain things that irritate you to build up inside. I have experienced withholding emotions in before and in the end, it will explode, it is just a matter of time. It may explode on to others or it may explode in the form of crying or depression.     The cause of your feelings of confusion and stress is probably because you feel overwhelmed and like you aren't deserving or worthy, you may not feel acknowledged, which is one of the worst feelings we can have as human beings.     You are deserving, you are worthy and you are lovely. I don't care how old you are, I don't care what race you are, what sex you are, where you're from or what you do. Every living thing in the entire Universe deserves love, no matter what they have done. People need to be forgiven. Forgive yourself, love yourself, allow yourself to feel worthy and loving.    I find one thing that may lead to unhappiness is simply not having anything to do. Always being stressed out with school and other things, you are busy and burned out. Even if you didn't have school, you may still be unhappy. However, that is only because it seems like you aren't doing anything in particular that you enjoy or that you can express yourself in doing.    You may be one of those people that have so many emotions bottled up inside that you have no idea where they are coming from. These emotions, feelings and bursts of inspiration/courage need to be expressed, on to anything, paper, music, anything.    People express themselves in many ways, find yours. I express myself through drawing with pencils, snowboarding and musical instruments. Often money is a problem if you don't have it to do these things. That's where getting a job comes in.    Learn to express yourself in some way. Even if you are bad at singing, even if you are bad at drawing or playing sports and music, DO IT! Because you will feel refreshed, re-energized, re-focused, concentrated and secure after wards.    Not expressing ones self is damaging to the soul. We need to express who we are through something, through anything. Simply doing homework and nothing else all day will give you no sense of achievement, accomplishment, satisfaction and peace of mind. It is not only important but vital to do something that will allow you to express yourself.    If you need money to buy musical instruments or lessons or snowboarding or whatever it may be to express yourself, it is important first of all that you take the initiative to want to do something for yourself and then second get a job. It is important you know that you want to do these things for yourself and then save up the money and buy those things to express yourself.     Even when you aren't expressing yourself, believe me you can feel happy, you will. You only feel you are stuck in a rut. But don't take yourself too seriously, don't take your emotions and feels too seriously, seriously. It isn't anything, they are only emotions, it is important not to be a servant to your mind but vice versa.  Okay?    I really hope you the best, and i know you will have more optimisim and insight into yourself. Good luck out there, if you have any further problesm or questions, feel free to email me: fcuk.america@hotmail.com (i made the email a long time ago lol) i am 16 by the way
h6UXw3Dxaa	There really is no etiquette.  They'll say hello, how are you? And you answer them.. then they go into asking questions.. answer them very honestly as the previous answerer said.  You'll get naked from the waist down, and they'll do an exam.  I don't know if you wanted to know exactly what takes place during an exam?  They take an instrument and put KY jelly on it, and insert it and this makes your vagina open very slightly. It should not hurt, and if it does, it won't last long so don't panic.    Then they take a really long cotton swab, and swab your vagina for tests. And its over.  I swear the whole exam takes about 5 minutes.  The longest part of the obgyn appointment is in the waiting room!    Good Luck girl!|`|1iKZaaNgaa	Tell her/him everything  Don't be afraid or embarrassed
9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	You might be having an allergic reaction to something. Try to figure out what's triggering the rash. If you can't, see an allergist.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	On your eyelid? & Do you lotion your body on a daily basis after bathing? You may have over excessive dry skin.
YEd9Q5KZaa	The brown ones are old blood and the red is "fresh" blood.|`|nUu7tUiqaa	These are simply blood clots. These can be formed if you are laying down for a period of time and then the blood binds together and forms a clot that will fall out of you when you stand. They are normal, to a degree. If you experience more than eight to ten blood clots during a normal, not heavy, period then you may need to go and see your doctor to see if you have something affecting your blood.|`|oDOPLTiPaa	Two weeks between cycles is not the norm. I think you should talk to your doctor about this. Usually brown blood is just older blood. Black clumps could be clots, but I think it's best to ask a doctor about it.|`|D2IapzLtaa	It maybe just some blood clots. If your concerned, Consult your doctor.|`|U6GZAbLxaa	The clots are from the walls of your vagina, its the lining thats being ripped off and thats what happens during your period.    The reason why its brown is because oxygen has gotten to it and when blood gets oxygen to it it turns brown.    Its not biggy.  Your cycle isn't regular yet.  Don't worry. = ]|`|Rx0ae0suaa	I would think it's just old blood or some blood clots.
YEd9Q5KZaa	Two a week? I **** like twice a day. I think you should go to a doctor.|`|nUu7tUiqaa	Healthy people should defecate at least every other day. This indicates that you either do not have a very healthy diet, which can be remedied very easily, or you have a problem with your colon and need to go to the doctor.|`|9da334de0d8258350046544850e0fa57aa	Your insides probaly need to be cleansed go to the pharmacy section and they got a bunch of saline cleansers. Or you can be constipated but not the constipated to where it hurts and you feel it, but the kind where your intestines arent getting the neccessary water it needs to help your poo pass. So try drinking alot more water. No soda for a while. Also could be your diet you should be pooing more that what you say ur usually doing, eat more fruits and veggies daily and that'll get you poo moving along pretty quick.(im sure your just not eating the right foods)|`|2sXqm4u9aa	I really don't know how old you are from your question, however,  the first thing you need to do is take a stool softener and then you probably need to change your diet to include ruffage, grains, cereals and products with bulk.  There is a process going on in your intestines called motilityI which moves the digested food through and out and when this slows down to poor eating habits it will cause constipation.  Cheeses, certain medications, etc., cause constipation and if you are eating 3 meals a day then you should be having bowel movements at least every 2 days at a minimum.  The rate of your metabolism also affects the time it takes to digest food and elimate it.  Try to increase your metabolism with some walking and exercise and you will notice the diffrence.  I you do not take steps to get your body back in tune your motility eventually stops (or forgets its purpose) and you wind up having to rely on enemas rather than regular body functions.  You could get bowel obstructions (which will kill you) as well as a host of other problems.  Take these steps and if you have no change.  YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR.

So, no it is not very likely that you are pregnant, however in a month you should take a test just to be sure.|`|1iKZaaNgaa	They have a pill called Plan B so if you're 18 or older you can go and it at the pharmacy without a prescription but you need a prescription if you're younger|`|U6GZAbLxaa	You probably aren't cause it was just one pill so the meds weren't out of your system or anything.   But go to a near by pharmacy and get the Plan B pill, its over the counter but if you aren't 18 you can't get it with out a parent.    Do it ASAP its better to be safe than sorry...

At that important moment, you want something soft and smooth, not rough.      According to a survey of 697 males by the web site HealthyStrokes.com in January 2009, 53 percent of males wipe up with a tissue, 21 percent use a piece of clothing, 12 percent let their underwear absorb it, 2 percent rub it into their skin, 4 percent eat it, and 4 percent don't clean up.      22 percent of males have a regular piece of clothing that they use as a clean-up rag.

KcloaW4vaa	Try playing some soccer, running, any sport that gets ur entire body mobile and working (NOT BASeBALL). You should start eating more veggies and fruits along with dairies. Try to eat less red meats and eat more fish and chicken. Also try not to eat as much food maybe cut out that snack before dinner or something, anything helps.    Then for working out, just do regulr workouts, but stay motivated.  Look up workouts for gymnastics, i do them and holy hell they work. You have to do that 6 inches with your feet of the ground. Hold your legs in the air straight in front of you. Look em up and ull know what im talking about.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	If you want to tone up at your weight, you will definitely have to drop body fat percentage.

Sl0UPcheaa	If you were pricked by a needle you could catch any disease from anyone else whos blood was on the needle. You should go see a doctor and get checked out.

Wait a while and take a test.|`|U6GZAbLxaa	Your could be pregnant because you majorly screwed up the pill. But You're period may be messed up because of the way you were taking the pill. When you are talking the pill it fakes your body out by telling it you already are pregnant.     Since you took a regular pill while on your period it stopped your period.     You boobs get tender hen your about to start, wait a day or so and try taking a pregnancy test.      The pill screws with your body when you dont take it right, when you do everything is regular.
4HwhJJKmaa	Push-ups work chest as the primary muscle and triceps as the secondary. Your biceps may be more toned but they shouldn't be any bigger. Your body may just be reacting positively on an overall basis since lean muscle burns fat. Keep up the good work.|`|VQiFFSnvaa	i dont kno wat "everyone" is telling you, but if your doing pushups daily, your biceps are going to get bigger, and so is your chest and triceps. its true that pushups dont focus on, or isolate, just your biceps, but doing enough of them will make your bis bigger|`|zZ55CRulaa	Push ups really don't do anything for biceps...When you say your biceps are bigger, you may be looking at your triceps. Your triceps cover much more of your arm than your bicep.|`|C2M2StR1aa	If you want push ups to build your chest muscles, put your hands further apart when you do them.  The farther apart your hands are the more you work the chest.     To work the arms more, put your hands close together (thumbs almost touching).  This is something you can easily test for yourself.     If you would like to try an exercise that strengthens your body's core check out hindu push ups.  I have written a page and posted a video clip on how to do them properly at the following link.     http://www.diet-and-exercise-for-health....     Good health and good luck!|`|MzWM9rBRaa	Any exercise you do like that which works out more than one muscle at a time will have that effect.  But pushups work your triceps mostly (if you're doing them right!) which accounts for more than half of your arm size.  So it's likely your triceps are getting bigger, making your arms look bigger overall.

Sometimes, the second baby molars take their time coming in|`|6rAqu6alaa	It would depend on how old your toddler is.  At 1 year old = there are about 10 primary teeth in the mouth.   14 months old = 12 teeth  16 months old = 14 teeth  18 months old = 16 teeth  20 months old = 18 teeth  2 years old = 20 teeth  Then at 6-7 years old, the permanent teeth start to erupt.  This also depends on how fast the tooth development is, gender, even heredity.

AEAxZEveaa	You're tasting the iron in your blood. Other blood types will taste the same. Anyway, there's A, B, O, and AB. This is the most common way to refer to blood typing. If you ask someone who studies this, they will tell you there are many other ways to classify blood, such as Rh factor (being A+ vs. A-). But this is probably what you're asking about. And by the way, it's not really "cleaner", it just doesn't have A or B antigens.|`|0Gvs8uj4aa	A, B, AB, and O are the major blood types that people refer to in everyday conversation. That's all well and good if that is all you're wondering, but there are really many more blood types than what I've just mentioned. Another popular division goes by Rh type. Every one of the previously mentioned blood types is either Rh positive or Rh negative. They all taste like metal pipes!|`|N6cuuDAmaa	A,B,O, and AB. If you want to find out what blood type you are then ask about it the next time you go to the doctors.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	There are four blood types A, B, AB, and O.  There is no such thing as a clean blood type.  You can't find out your blood type without having it typed.  Your blood will taste like a metal pipe because of the hemoglobin an iron molecule that carries the oxygen in your blood.
ALC0oqWyaa	I'm not sure what the law is in your area, but here, you can't get a job until you are 14yr9months.  I think you will probably have to face some hurdles.  Especially given your age, as a lot of the time clinics do not like to hire people so young.  Your time may be better spent studying so that you have the good marks required.  Try joining clubs and extra curricular associations that will look good on applications.
PfE6bg5iaa	peak effectiveness will probably be reached two months from the time you started the pill. Since you're starting midcycle, you should have a complete normal month on the pill.    Use a backup method like condoms until then, better to be safe than sorry (and pregnant)    Good luck! I hope the pills help with your irregular cycle!

1BKu2qd6aa	A lymph node that is rubbery and moveable is quite common. There are lots of lymph nodes in the neck area and sometimes they enlarge in response to an infection and then stay enlarged.  A lump that is present for a long time, is not attached to the underlying tissue ( is moveable) and smaller than 2 cm wouldn't raise suspicions.  That is probably why your doctor told you not to worry. If the lump were hard and not moveable,  was growing quickly and larger than 2 cm your doctors would have biopsied it.  If you touch it all the time you might irritate it and then it may swell. ( I'm a nurse and have seen lots of lumps over the years )|`|6GtVcOIMaa	It may not be a lymph node, then again, it may very well be...it could be a tumor, but hold on!

m8VwHq3jaa	It could just be that your lymph node might not be draining well.I think you could just ask your doctor to drain it off.But i would just suggest get a needle biopsy done just to be on the safer side.  since you mentioned your blood counts are all normal it could be an infection.I read some place that even having cats around can cause this.There are a couple of yoga poses that can help you drain these naturally .Look up on the internet for these yoga asanas.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	It could well be a wrong diagnosis..look at following website    http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/swolle...    If you are not happy with what your doctor says you are quite entitled to see a specialist.  If he refuses then change your doctor. I don't think you are a hypochondriac...your just concerned as would anyone. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign of infection somewhere I believe..I also read the following on another site...( Duration: Inflammatory lumps settle once the primary source of infection is treated. A neck lump which is persistent (> 6 weeks) with or without associated symptoms needs referral to an ENT surgeon.)  So go get that referral!  Good luck and take care.
Rx0ae0suaa	It's probably nothing if blood tests are coming back normal. If you think it's a little bit bigger you could go back to the doctors and ask them what they think, but keep in mind that it may just be your imagination that thinks the node has gotten bigger.    If you truly believe something might be wrong with it, perhaps get a second opinion and ask for a biopsy, but if it's painless, you feel fine and test results are fine, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|OpduZC3Eaa	I have something similar in the same area but I've had mine since I was born. Sometimes it gets itchy and then that gets really weird! I am a hypochondriac as well and sometimes I will think it's the worst of possibilities and I have days left of my life. I've had it checked out and everything and every time it turns out to be just fine. It's just apart of my body and it's natural. Things like that show up on the body every once in a while but just so long as you have it checked out then you should be fine. It's okay! I know it's hard to not think about it often because of the hypochondria but it really probably is nothing. Just another part of the body.
dbVQpbScaa	Yes, a drug called Xeloda (Capecitabine) used in colon cancer is used twice daily.  In addition other medications will also be there as combination chemotherapy is usually prescribed.    Yes in alternative therapies as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI etc, admission to hospital is required, as they are continuos therapies.  Side effect of therapy depends on the drugs used.|`|P544Sbmqaa	I dont know a whole lot about colon cancer, it would depend on the specific type of cancer and the treatment protocol.  However, yes, there are situations like that.  My cancer is leukemia, and I was admitted for all of my treatments, for a min of a week and received chemo on a continuous drip for the treatment for 5 days.  There are a couple of times that I was admitted for 4 weeks, and once that I was admitted for 6 weeks.  That is common for leukemia though.  One of my hospital mates had been admitted for 4 months.    Talk to the doctor about the specific treatment protocol and the most common side effects associated with the specific meds.  If you dont know, cancer and chemo are both just umbrella terms.  There are over 200 different types of cancer, so when you say colon cancer, that doesnt tell us a lot, there are many different types of cancer that could start in the colon, and when you say chemo, there are thousands of meds that can fall under that category.|`|icgTII3Maa	The frequency of chemotherapy is dependent on the severity of the cancer. So, if the doctor deems it needed to have two chemo therapies done during the day, then yes, it is possible. Patients often opt to stay at the hospital while having chemotherapy so when any complications occur, medical care is easily given. Also, their condition is easily monitored when in the hospital.    Common side effects of chemotherapy include weakness, nausea, headache, loss of appetite, etc.
150esu4Daa	I've never personally had them, but my mom does get them every now and then. She might have a similar pattern as you actually because I remember the first time she had them I was like 5 or 6 (I'm 24 now) and then she got them again almost a year ago and had another case last month! So I definitely think you could very well have shingles again, go get checked out! Good luck!

dBoC8fR2aa	I know that you know a lot of moisture to puff up you facial area to look round. So you friend and you use a wet tea-bag on around your eye to hydrate the area. There is a cosmetic patch on sale at Watson for the same purpose. Of course yours is cheaper. At the same time, if you drink more water, it also help you to hydrate your skin too and every parts as well.|`|AA10006931	I don't know what you mean by 'eye pockets', but I've heard of people using warm teabags as hot compresses for styes and other irritations of the eyelids. This works fairly well, at least about as well as anything else that's warm. I've seen people use anything from a washcloth to teabags to baked potatoes! -- and, provided it's still warm (or you reheat it) can be re-used.   The other thing that's nice about the teabag, at least according to some research, is that some of the contents of the tea can have antibacterial properties, which can also help clear things up on the eyelids.  Make sense?
vHGFIrkxaa	Well bench is good having low rep sets but high weigh is good to build your muscles larger. but high rep and low weigh  sets will tone your muscles and help you look more ripped, i advise pushups though because you wont need a spotter to be safe and its also very effective but do what ever is up to you. also you will be sore the first week but the more you do it you wont get sore anymore so yes its normal, and remember that of you want to work your pecks/chest only work that out on a single day so you body will have time to repair the muscles. After the work out if your muscles feel full off blood then you have worked out correctly
kVybkdOsaa	I am 46 and done with menopause.  I used natural progesterone cream to balance out my estrogen/progesterone.      Here are the benefits I experienced:    no hot flashes  weight loss around the abdomen  no more irritability  no more sadness  return of sex drive  no more fatigue  dramatic increase in energy  dramatic increase in ability to handle stress  no more bloating    To sum up, I feel better than I have ever felt in my life.  As mentioned earlier, menopause is natural and normal.  It should not make us sick and certainly does not warrant the use of drugs-menopause is not a disease to be treated with man-made chemically altered hormones or antidepressants.|`|enqNTpzXaa	Every woman, since the dawn of humanity, has gone through menopause. Menopause is a natural event in every woman's life. You're not sick, but you sure don't feel good!    Grandmother called it "the change of life." It's simply the body deciding you don't have to get pregnant anymore. Whee! That's the good part.    Unfortunately, the transition from being a fertile woman to a healthy, happy non-fertile woman has some uncomfortable symptoms. You know what they are. You're probably experiencing them.|`|f8beb0f39e39dc8d1bdf133008928cd0aa	I have been taking Black Cohosh, which comes in a capsule, you can buy it at most drugstores, and at health food stores.

You also can get some natural products like Monazac. It is also quite popular among the menopausal women.
FicyC2TXaa	Because it's bollocks. Sorry.    Laetrile/B17/amygdalin is one of the few 'alternative' therapies that has actually been tested; not only has it been shown to be ineffective against cancer, it's dangerous as it contains cyanide.    There's no such vitamin as B17; it was invented to give respectability to laetrile, a commercial preparation of apricot kernels.      Please research thoroughly before you or anyone you know invests money, hope and - most dangerous of all for a cancer patient - time in ineffective and dangerous treatment.    Sadly wherever there is cancer there is an unscrupulous charlatan eager to separate desperate people from their cash for useless 'cures'. 'B17' is one such scam    Please be wary of ubsubstantiated testimonials, especially on the inernet; you have no way of knowing if the person ever had cancer in the first place, much less that they were 'cured'.    Read this article for the facts about this particular scam:    http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRela...|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	That's not true. That vitamin thing has been around forever. My pediatric oncologist told me of a family who pulled their child out of treatment to go to Mexico for that only to find it failed and they came running back but it was too late to save their daughter as a result, whereas had they stuck with the hospital she had a fighting chance.    I don't think any parent in their right mind would risk a proven cure/treament over a floozy advertisement.    If it worked believe me modern medicine would have incorporated it.    Besides, the doc told me that oncologists wanted to pair up and work with that person and do studies and they had refused.  Not sure if it's exactly this particular vitamin but I'm pretty sure it was one of those B vitamin "CURES".    This is just another example of the unethical trying to profit off a desperate and dying individual.|`|R9KvEhMxaa	Because it's another scam. An old one. And it only pops up because someone's wants to make a quick buck exploiting desperate people. As I recall, there's a very large number of people in prison for selling some apricot derived product to cancer patients, as it is poisonous.    Oh, and that whole 'can't make money on something natural'? That's a load. Think about how much Bayer made off Aspirin, or BMS made off of Taxol.|`|AA12212523	SPAM and garbage. People have made a lot of money selling apricots and apricot pits to desperate people who grab at hope.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Because every single peer reviewed scientific trial using this has shown NO evidence that it can cure cancer and that it actually HARMS patients.  If you "know" someone who took this and it cured them, you are either lieing, or they are lieing, or they didnt really have cancer.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	There's also no such vitamin as b17. It was made up so this quackerey would not be subject to fda approval. It has cured no one.|`|emNCaAq7aa	This is an old old story. Many people were hurt in the late 1950's and early 60'd using laetrile (B17), the apricot pit poison, to cure their cancer. it does not work and is old old news.  They are allowed to sell int he US because we have specific laws allowing anything that is derived from a food substance to be sold. The large supplement lobby in Utah and their in the pocket congressmen got it passed int he early 70's.  All other modern countries do not allow such advertising of fake cures.|`|8XigtCWGaa	Probably because everybody is always and constantly bombarding us with ads wanting to sell us something and we are always buying stuff that doesn't work. Proof is needed or people just aren't going to buy. Why jump into something if it hasn't had extensive research and double blind studies? Waste of money.
fc6c6d98a843c15862389c029ff47a3caa	Women should have the right to choose what happens with their body, plain and simple.    A girl who posted before said "If you don't want it, just give it up for adoption." Really?? So it's better to give your fully developed, born, living & breathing CHILD away to somebody you don't know than to just end the pregnancy at a early stage? If you really want to have this argument based on "morals" you need to think it all the way through. Look at the news, look at all the horrible stuff that happens to children in foster homes or even after they're officially adopted. There are a lot of crazy people in this world, and there's just no way to be sure before you sign that child over.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not against adoption either, but that's not the answer for everybody. I believe that a woman should be provided with options, whether extremists find it "sinful" or "morally wrong" shouldn't have anything to do with the LAW. We're supposed to keep religion & law separate, right? So before you say that it should be illegal, think about your reason why. Is it because your religion/beliefs say that it is "wrong"? Maybe so, but women will do what they have to do regardless, so why TRY to take away their right to choose?    I'll say again what I've always said. While I don't personally believe in abortions, especially as a form of birth control, I believe whole-heatedly in a woman's right to decide what's best for her.|`|JLUVZgV2aa	it should be a womens choice.  its her body, the baby is living in HER body.  its as simple as that.  she deffinitly should have the right to choose.  no one else should be able to make the decision for her besides herself!  i strongly believe that,|`|bunAXlrXaa	ok...first of all i am female  i say that abortions should be illegal  1. you're killing an INNOCENT human being.  2. take responsibility for what you did and if you don't want the baby, don't do it again and GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION!!!  3. consider this...why do you want an abortion?  you don't want the embarrassment?  you think that people won't find out if you get an abortion?  believe me...they will somehow someway  you don't want the responsibility of a child? why did you have sex in the first place without pills or condom?  and if it's and accident GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION!!!  4.IT'S MURDER  to sum it all up...take responsibility because you caused it    and if you were raped...everybody would understand, so GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION!!!|`|SiSplXXsaa	It shouldn't be used as birth control, there are tons of better (and less painful) methods to prevent conception.    At the same time, unplanned things happen, and in the end, if it was outlawed, too many women would die by the hands of back-alley doctors. I think adoption should be legal, but would love to see a day when it's unneeded.|`|quM6eMT6aa	i believe a women should have the right to an abortion if she wants it that way its her child and her conscience if she can live with that then right on i believe that women should have the right to legal abortions because what if it was rape i doubt anyone wants a constant reminder of that people need to look past the point of abortion and realize why the women is requesting it it should be entirely up to her and nobody else|`|MhpccWpmaa	I think that women should be allowed to have abortions simply because I feel that it is their choice.  I can see where the anti-abortionists come from in some perspectives, but overall I don't agree with them.  Women ultimately are the ones who raise the child. Yes, a lot of men are in their children's live and I'm not saying anything against them.  But in cases where the guy doesn't want the kid he can just walk away and leave her with all the responsibility.  I feel that a child is more of a responsibility to the woman than to the man in our society and I just feel that because of this a woman has a right to choose whether she wants that or not.|`|x15GsmEiaa	I have had 3 abortions... and they were all for very valid reasons....    * The first one - so i could finish school.  * The second - so i could go home to get married (as I wouldn't be allowed through UK customs if I was pregnant and not British)  * The third time - as I had just had a baby and had depression (after giving birth)    Don't get me wrong, these were all over a period of 10 years and having one child.    I know how hard it is.. I was pregnant 8 weeks after having my first child. It was had.. as I was looking at one right in front of me, yet realizing what I had to do.    I think women have every right to have an abortion. It is their choice...     There are ways for these women to copy after abortion..     * one of them is to write a letter to your baby and apologies and explain why and burn it.  * the second one is to believe that it is a body and as it is born it gets a soul. If you abort this one, the next one you have will have that soul.    I have been with my man for 10 years and married for 4 years. I have learnt my lesson (better late then never). His penis does not touch my vagina until i hit menopause... we use condoms.    I REALLY strongly think that it is the person choice. It is depending on if that person could give them a good life (and why must that person suffer from giving them up for adoption and causing them trauma in their life when they are older and wanting to know truths...    It is really sad, especially when you see documentaries and websites.... but it is not the publics choice.. rather an abortion then a suicide!.    WOMENS RIGHTS!!! And not only in the US... ALL OVER the world!|`|uiVEaxjqaa	I believe its right because if someone can't take care of a child or there not ready why should they have to keep it? and i don't like adoption because its hard on the person that has to give up their child and the child as well because that child could go to a bad home they could have to move around from different homes and i know that my self that its hard to do that. and also that child might grow up thinking wow my parents didn't want me or might have to live their whole life wondering who their real parents where. also if someone was raped i believe its ok too because how how is someone sapost to love their child when every time you look at them your have to remember how they got there so i believe it should be legal for those reasons.

FicyC2TXaa	There's no guaranteed cure for any cancer.    The problem with finding a cure is that cancer is not a single disease, it's an umbrella term for over 200 different diseases. The difficulty with finding a cure is that different cancers are caused by different things, so no one strategy can prevent them They all respond to different treatments so no one treatment can cure them, so there isn't a magic bullet that cures all cancers and there never will be.    But quite a few cancers can already be cured: seven out of ten children are cured of cancer; testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and many cases of leukaemia can all be cured in adults with chemotherapy, most skin cancers are cured with surgery and many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured with radiotherapy.    Many other types of cancer are also cured if they are found early enough     Can we lay the Otto Warburg business to rest once and for all? There's no secret to it - the information is freely available to anyone with a computer and a little time.      Dr Warburg's  research must be among the most misrepresented in the world. He  won the 1931 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine not for finding a 'cure for cancer' but for"for his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme", His research with tissue slices led to the discovery of oxygen-transferring enzymes in cellular respiration. But his research never showed that oxygen use by normal and cancer cells was different. What he did find was that cancer cells produced lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen whereas normal cells only produced lactate from glucose in the absence of oxygen. This observation led him to conclude that energy metabolism in cancer cells was defective .    By 1960, research had identified nearly all energy-producing metabolic pathways in both normal and cancer cells and showed that energy-producing systems in normal cells were the same as those found in cancer cells .    Interestingly, it's often claimed Warburg won a second Nobel Prize for his work in 1944; he didn't, it went to Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Spencer Gasserhis that year, but it's become part of the Otto Warburg folklore.     The year he did win it, his Nobel lecture did not contain the word 'cancer' at all, which is odd if that's what he was getting his award for.|`|5657dabb07790f85827e1c0e8e02e5c0aa	My 88-year-old Dad -- who is suspicious of anyone and everyone -- says that's because the pharmaceutical companies don't want there to be a cure because they'll lose too much money.  But of course my Dad is suspicious of even the garbageman -- so I don't put any stock in that theory.  But then, on the other hand, Dad has been right-on when it came to being suspicious of some of the men I was involved with ... so now I'm scared to just automatically discount some of the stuff he tells me.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Cancer is not a virus or bacteria you can immunize or take an antibiotic for. It is uncontrolled cell division that can have multiple causes and and cause many different symptoms. It kills by crowding out other cells and destroying their ability to function.   Scientists have found ways to cure many cancers but  not all types and not in all cases. It is  not a single disease that has one answer as a cure. The common cold is also hundreds of different virii that cause the same symptoms so a vaccine that would kill them all may not be made,|`|69SHxWA9aa	Cancer is as easy to kill as the common cold.  It was proven by a guy who won a Nobel Prize for Medicine.    Google Dr. Otto Warburg.  However don't expect to know what I know, because it will close down a lot of research institutions.    Good Luck!|`|AA11375099	Cancer can be cured, look at Lance Armstrong or Christine Applegate.  They survived cancer and are doing fine.  The problem though is that fighting cancer is like being in a war.    It does not mean that those that have died of cancer have not tried to fight it as hard as humanly possible, it only means that they were not as lucky as those that have.    Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation are the main ways doctors fight cancer.  It is a hard battle because two of the three treatments are poisonous to the body.  The other involves cutting the cancer out like a mastectomy.  It is a difficult battle to fight, but at least there is hope for those diagnosed with this terrible disease.|`|AA10481903	Which type of cancer are you asking about?  Cancer is hundreds of different 'diseases'.  In fact, no two cancers are biochemically/genetically the same.  If you have 1000 women with breast cancer, no two of those cancers are genetically the same.    Additionally, recent research indicates no two cancer cells in a tumor are the same!  A tumor large enough to be diagnosed (about the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil) contains 500 Million cells! - and none of them are identical!    So, how do you "cure cancer" when every cancer cell is different from every other cancer cell?    Leading cancer researchers are starting to acknowledge that the war on cancer needs to focus in a new direction - on Prevention.  It is believed that at least 50% of all cancers are preventable.    Best wishes and good luck.

SDFTzz5qaa	Having epilepsy, I've found that marijuana actually helps prevent me from seizing, if I smoke as soon as I get my aura (warning/feeling a seizure is about to occur). Were people talking to you? Because if you were answering back, you most likely weren't havning a seizure. I don't have grand mal seizures (the ones most people think of, with full body shakes) but partial complex brain seizures, and when I get them I space out with a deja vu feeling, but it took me 2 years before I was with someone who said I just kept grabbing my shirt while I sweared afterward that I had given her an actually response.    If you don't have a history of seizures, or could carry a conversation while it happened, I doubt you had a seizure. It sounds more like you smoked a little bit too much one of your first times without educating yourself on the effects and high of the marijuana and had a panic attack.

Zw5B1DmCaa	Hi there, So you want to target weight loss in your thighs? Targetting an area when losing weight is basicaly impossible to predict. Weightloss is drawing on fat reserves for energy and repair, it takes it from where it can get it. Best option i would think for you is stick to a healthy diet, drink the required 2 litres of water based liquid per day, (2-4 if going to the gym or competing in sport event), and work on exercises that will tone the thighs, such as squats, lunges, burpees. aim for 12 reps, 3 sets, morninig and night, then the following week, 13 reps, 3 sets, then 14 reps ... and so on.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	It's physically impossible to "spot reduce" fat.

8RQCa3SXaa	Don't worry, when you start you're boyfriend will be completely out of it.  nothing will stop a guy enjoying it.    is this your first time?  if so you may wanna know that its not so much moving your hands around all over his penis, more of a get hold of it and erm, do what you have to do.    either way he'll feel turned on by you touching him.  if this fails, go for it using you mouth. (it wont let me say *******). its seriously not as bad as it sounds and he may prefer it.    Hope this helps (:|`|X58gVB7Eaa	Just try giving him a hand job. Practice on a banana its quite easy after you get the hang of it. You should be comfortable with him, so ask him if he minded that your hands were sweaty.|`|aQ8o4w3Xaa	In all honesty, he probably won't notice. He'll be so preoccupied and focused on what you're doing, he probably won't give two hoots what state your hands are in. Maybe just have a towel close by, then if it builds up you can just take a short break, wipe them and continue.   Anyway, you must have touched his body before, so he knows what to expect and what it feels like.    Good luck, I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|6qsocyK3aa	It might work in your favour as you'll need less lube. Seriously.|`|91c6bKdwaa	most guys want it to be wet so its slippery.

UHb5GFIIaa	Hi there, some women suffer irregular periods and i am one of them, however if it is worrying you in any way, maybe speak to someone you can trust maybe your mum, or go and see you doctor, are you on any medication ? sometimes they can case irregular periods, i am not meaning to sound as if i am patronising in any way, but as you are only 15 your body is still maturing into a grown women and is going through many changes.    try not to worry to much, that can have an effect on your period too !    take care x|`|MhpccWpmaa	Many women have irregular periods. I would say that it's normal and nothing to worry about because even if you've been having a regular period our bodies do some pretty wierd things|`|8IIVBPwkaa	Sometimes weird things can happen with periods. If everything else seems ok, my advice would be to wait and see what happens. If your next period comes as expected, then great, if not, see your doctor.    Good luck!|`|G3eYnXhFaa	Considering you are only 15 this is still a normal thing to occur, lots of teenage girls get irregular periods. luckily yours only lasted less than 2 days and wasn't heavy.  If your period cycle starts changing a lot and periods start becoming heavier then you should see your doctor but other than that your periods should go back to normal soon enough.
nN8D64Yzaa	i suggest you don't try to lose weight where you are right now, but i'm sure you know that.    to get stronger you need to be eating a lot healthier than you are.  where's the protein, fruit, and vegetables? you're eating mostly carbs, but not enough food in general to gain muscle (and keep in mind that gaining muscle will make you gain weight, so don't despair if the numbers go up--you'll look skinnier!)     what i've found is that the best way to get stronger and look fitter comes from the abs diet principles. eat 6 small meals a day, and eat until you're full. don't deprive yourself of food, you're working out a lot!    foods that will help you gain muscle and lose fat usually have fatty acids and high protein: almonds, berries, whole grains, smoothies, peanut butter, leafy green vegetables, high-fiber fruits, protein powder (mix it in your smoothie!), energy bars (i love luna bars), milk, and WATER! drink lots of water, about 3 liters depending on how hard you're working out.    good luck!|`|bed556c412329f084e39442c54231151aa	In terms of weight loss, you are fine.    In terms of becoming stronger, just do some weight training, don't run with weights as your body is still forming, and that can be detrimental to your body long term.|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Well, for lunch I'd have a grilled chicken salad instead of a muffin...since muffins have a lot of calories.  I would eat at least a little bit for dinner...Because when you don't eat...Your metabolism doesn't really work...Meaning that you have to eat at least at lil bit to keep your metabolism working and burning fat.    I saw your pic...and I think you are skinny...You are tall, so I don't think you need to lose too much weight...If you do...You'll probably look too skinny...    As far as getting stronger goes...I'd do push ups...Lots of push ups, and sit ups, you are doing good with running...Always run...Its the best way to stay strong and in shape.|`|etTACCfvaa	Work with crunches, you will have a four pack and you wont get fat
37PYnKr9aa	Well I had to go in because of that last year. The Doctor sticks the tool in your ear. This is the same tool he checks your eyes with. Then he may stick some fluid in there to clean it if you have wax build up. That is the worst part, doesn't hurt, but is like when you get water in it. Then the doctor will give you a prescription for the ear infection. Should not be too bad. Shots are worse, but I am prone to pain because I have a few tattoos and did not think they hurt very bad. Good luck.|`|emNCaAq7aa	The doc will use an otoscope, a simple lighted device, to look in your ear canal from the outside. The doc is looking for redness or actual damage to the eardrum. The doc may also take a throat culture and look down your throat (say ah) to see if the eaustation tube is blocked. If it is usually an anti histamine will help. If there is an infection simple antibiotics are usually prescribed.  To relieve pain now apply a hot moist compress on that side of the face. This allows blood flow and opening of the tube to relieve the pressure that is usually causing the ear ache.|`|g6tku4aVaa	i have an ear infection..i get that all the time..  with my doctor..it feels good  don't ask  he's a really good doctor though urs might be different.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	You remember,, he is going to look in your ear and then give you a Rx if you have an infection.  Medical procedures haven't changed for that type of issue for many years.    BTW forget the cupcake answer,, they let the retarded kids in the home on the computer on Mondays|`|NO9qfLhlaa	No worries...the doc will just look in, maybe swab you for strep if your throat is sore, then prescribe something if necessary. Hope you feel better!|`|iQ6YJPmqaa	just tell your pain & tell every symptoms that you feel.
8qhbUsolaa	Well. I always manage to stay trim while injured and my method is if you have a sprained ankle you:    Definately lay off the cardio... but that doesn't mean you can't excersise and burn calories. You can still burn calories by doing various weight excercises (While sitting down if prefered) with dumbells etc. Or try different variations of crunches and core/abdominal excersises so that your ankle is in a comfortable position. Peform the excersises more with speed than weight as this will speed up your metabolic rate which means you burn fat.    Or if your feeling a bit lazy you can:    Stay to do the diet side and speed up your metabolic rate by just diet.  Your diet should consist of 6 (small) meals a day. You should eat less carbohydrate because  your body burns things in the order of:    . Carbohydrate  . Fat  . Protein    So eat more fat than carbs so you can get straight down to burning fat (Remember! eating fat prevents from storing it). But do not eat too much fat, and just the healthy fat, I'm not telling you to stuff your face with McDonalds. Eat foods such as    Nuts  Avacados  Olive oil  Slim meat    and stay away from processed foods and saturated fat. Mono un-saturated fats and poly un-saturated fats are ok (check on the back of food packaging for fats)    Try both methods if you want. I do.    So this is all the info i can give as it helped me. One more thing....... Drink about 8 or more Large glasses of water a day. Drinking alot of water is the key.VERY IMPORTANT.    I hope this helps|`|CVsoh7lUaa	The best way to loose weight fast is by choosing the right foods.  FOOD is more powerful than any prescription weight loss pills, because the FOOD that you eat can either make you THIN or FAT.   You don't get fat because of a lack of exercising, that's a myth.  You get fat because you don't eat the right foods at the right intervals each day.    To optimize metabolism, energy, and mental and emotional positivity, set a goal to eat five or six small meals per day  do NOT skip meals. Sometimes you will feel like you dont have the time or the energy to put anything together, but this is critical to your success. Your body and your metabolism are designed to look for cues telling them when to burn and when to conserve. If you miss a meal your body does what it is programmed to do  stop burning. Ideally, the five meals include breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack and dinner. On occasion, you may also enjoy a healthy and delicious fat-burning dessert after dinner. This five meal ideal will keep your metabolism burning brightly, and your brain will enjoy a steady source of fuel, keeping you mentally sharp and safe from those challenging blood sugar drops that spur cravings for sub-par food choices.  So how much should you eat at each meal? Begin by keeping in mind that there is no one definition of a serving size. With both the Food Pyramid and Nutrition Facts labels, the serving size is simply a unit of measure and may not represent the amount you are really eating. For example, an English muffin represents two Food Pyramid servings of bread, despite the fact that the Nutrition Facts label on the package defines a serving as one muffin.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	you could lift weights i guess,    If your ankles hurts really bad, its better if you just stay off it as much as you can,  The sooner it recovers the Sooner you get back to your Work Outs.

Obviously avoid the treadmill and aerobics and dance classes but there are a ton of other exercises you can safely do.  Swimming, shadow boxing, row machine and maybe biking shouldn't aggravate your ankle.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	I don't get how a sprained ankle can throw off your diet.  Stick to your diet.  Studies have shown that diet is more important than exercise if you had to choose between the two.  Try swimming and do core workouts focusing on your abs.  A stability ball would be a great addition to your workout.  Also you can still do weights with your arms.  Mostly you have to stay focused on the goal.|`|1qYHuPXqaa	You can easily lose 9 Lbs.

tVF9O1Olaa	I do not want to sound rude but what do you want people on here to say? Most people answer this question and give you good answers about not giving up and that you are not old at 31 but yet you still keep posting this same question. So what is it you want to hear?    And by the way if you stop feeling sorry for yourself you will realise that most people don't have 'cute lives' like you think, just some of us don't want to be a victim and work hard to get our lives back on track.     I do feel sorry for your situation but i too have BPD, social anxiety and depression which has been caused by a very tough childhood but i don't sit feeling sorry for myself i get help and work towards a better future. Yes i know it is hard but it better than sitting at home wasting your life. You are 31 which many people have told you is not old but you still keep posting this same question. Why don't you stop thinking life has treated you bad and work towards getting a better life, there are people out there who have had it worse than you. Children who are disabled from child abuse, children who die from child abuse, at least you have the chance to change your life unlike them so do something about it. Posting the same question on here will not change you, only you can so do it.    You can give me a thumbs down but i am telling the truth. People on here give you good answers but you are the one who is not listening to the good advice.|`|wcp7DHhvaa	Its never too late for anyone to start over. I was once told that the past is the past and it doesnt define who you are. What defines who you are is what you are doing now. Its good to know that you still have goals for yourself. Dont give up. Nobody is perfect. Life is hard and you have had the worst of it, its time to get the best of it. Good luck. Never let others put you down and tell you what you cant do. The sky is the limit|`|e070ec3194eed61566c16087a378eeefaa	After all you've been through, you still have the strength to have dreams and goals. That's miraculous! Congratulations!    You should go after your dreams. And no you're not old. Stay focused on your goals and day after day you will see your dreams getting fullfilled.    Dont listen to people,listen to yourself.
hsKFt4auaa	Stop with all the medicines - that can't be good for the lining of your colon.  Try Dannon Activa yogurt every morning for breakfast and naturally you will go to the bathroom.  You need to be swallowing stuff and letting this happen the natural way instead of injecting stuff into your butt.  Also, make sure in the mean time to not eat stuff high in fat and carbs.  Eat green leafy veggies and eat plenty of yogurt!!|`|q411DXsFaa	It seems you have tried everything. Did you hold the enema in long enough?? Try a stronger laxative, What about Glycerin Suppositories??? I used to take the pink pill laxative but I cant remember the name.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	It sounds to me like you have a problem with diarrhea, not constipation. Yogurt is a good idea to put the good bacteria back in your colon that you lost from having diarrhea but don't use it as a laxative, it is to stop diarrhea. Try taking Metamucil everyday without fail after you get rid of diarrhea. I take Miralax also and have for 8 years because of a digestive disorder my bowels shut down 8 years ago. Sometimes I have to take 2 doses to get it to work. Maybe you need to increase the dosage. Before I took Miralax I took Milk of Magnesia. It worked good and no cramps, I used the cherry flavor. Another thing that will get your bowels moving is Epsom's Salts. They don't taste good but they work really good. Give it a try. The directions are on the bag and it won't hurt if you add a little extra Epsom's salts. Hope some of these suggestions help you.
AA10723498	I must say, even though I don't know you, I feel proud of you.  This takes a lots of courage to admit you may have a problem.  You actually are taking the first step to stop drinking.  Once you can admit that you have a problem, each day you will be more convinced that you do have a problem.  I was married to an alcoholic for a long time.  I never drank and he wouldn't admit he had a problem.  Obviously, we divorced because I couldn't take it any more.  I became a psych nurse to help people with addictions, as well as other mentally challenging problems.  You do have a problem because you depend on the alcohol to help you sleep.  Instead of drinking, read, watch TV, call a support group, join one first.  There are many people like you but you are not fully addicted.  If you continue, you will be.  I'm not going to sugar coat this problem because I know what addictions do to people.  You already took your first step, now take the next one and join a support group.  If you want to talk, e-mail me and I will be glad to do everything I can to help you.  Bravo to you.|`|KKCMIE04aa	If it is not a problem, you should have no problem not drinking for the next 30 days. Easy self assessment tool.|`|e11af2059864fde560c420f94bfaea71aa	Alcohol addicts are characterized as people who will drink until they black out. In a recent study, people who are alcohol addicts actually posess a certain gene that makes them the way they are.     If you aren't drinking until you black-out and you don't drink every moment, than you aren't addicted. You are just lacking self-control.    However, I'm not saying that this isn't a problem. This is a problem and you need to know it. Drinking ruins people's lives all the time. You're not just screwing your life up, you're ruining it for people who love you as well. You need to realize that alcohol is not a reliance tool, it's a bad thing. Talk to people, and hopefully you can find some help.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Sounds like you are dependent upon alcohol.  Even if it's just to get to sleep.  If you are looking to kick the habit, you may need to talk to your doctor about getting a sleeping pill.  If you do that though, you need to make sure that you stop drinking before bed.  It is NOT a good idea to mix alcohol and medications.  I am glad that you're looking critically at your behavior, that is usually the hardest step.  Good luck.|`|zAi5Xl1Laa	If you are questioning if you have an alcohol problem, then you probably do.  From what you describe, it sounds like you may have a problem.  If you are depending on it (which you are) or you cannot stop, then you have a problem.  Now, I don't think it sounds like you are a full-blown alcoholic, but it could go that way if you don't stop.  Try stopping on your own.  If you cannot, please seek help before you have a really big issue.    Best of luck to you!|`|CRPesW63aa	It's called 'self medication'.  You've found a solution to your problem that is socially unacceptable, and somewhat dangerous if it gets out of hand.    Maybe your an alcoholic, maybe you just have a sleep disorder. Either way, maybe you should talk to a doctor. If its' a sleep disorder, there might be a much better solution for you.
newfiOPOaa	At 12 it is not all that uncommon.  It is something he will probably grow out of.  You may have heard of "bashful bladder"?   Some guys, even adults, cannot pee in the presence of someone.  When urologists measure urine flow to reveal how much a man's ability to pee is obstructed by an enlarged prostate, they set up the equipment and then leave the patient in the room alone to pee.   They do so because often the presence of someone else in the room will restrict the patients ability to urinate normally and thus skew the test results because of a psychological factor.  Maybe you should pee in a urinal adjacent to his the next  time you are both in a public restroom as long as no one else is present.  Help him to be less weary or embarrassed?  It will take time.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	He's normal, it's nothing to worry about.|`|Uxw0Ks6Daa	its annoying for guys to go in the stalls to pee|`|zOIgzIy4aa	maybe you will have to teach him.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	that is very common and normal..|`|E64juLwJaa	Embarrassment to stand there for others to see you.Very common.

Yn6pM2Xyaa	you can certainly talk to your dentist about options for moving the tooth or possibly filing it down or something.. hard to say as I dont know exactly what the situation is but one step I would suggest for you first is to try professionally whitening them.. you would be amazed at how much of a difference that can make for people..  someone with slightly crooked teeth nearly erase all evidence of it to other people when they lighten their teeth because there are no dark spots and shadows to emphasize the lack of perfection.|`|Vh7SYMACaa	Although its hard, I would recommeng going to your dentists and saying "look im not happy with my teeth I would like to know what you can do to sort the problem out".

See if your orthodontist still has access to the molds from when your retainer was first made. Good luck!|`|ea0sWPUmaa	go back and see your orthodontist, you may need to have another appliance on for a wee while, depending on how far the tooth has moved.  teeth are always moving, which is why you should always wear your retainer, it should be with you for life now!  don't panic though, it can be fixed!|`|UfRMJheeaa	You can have the tooth shaved down....
b77c2aa72e0d0d360129311f88b3a5c0aa	I feel for you as I had a rotten childhood and was constantly scared of the raised voices of my parents. This has continued into adulthood and I am always frightened by shouting and swearing and am terrified as to what it might lead to. I have had counselling for this but it is impossible to wipe away memories. If there was only a 'magic pill ' that took it all away but it doesn't exist. I put on an act for everyone and I'm the Clown of the crowd but when I go indoors the real me is back. Have you got a person you can confide in? I don't mean a Counsellor unless you feel you need one. I used to go to Art Therapy and you could paint out your feelings on any paper you liked and with any substance you liked too.

Try this for me.  Try soaking in a hot bath for 25 minutes and  Drink 8oz. of warm milk 1 hr. before your bedtime for 7 days straight and see if that helps put you to sleep.

axwdwiSuaa	Alrighty, sounds like you have some common problems most ppl go through. Don't worry! Just follow these steps!:)    Adjusting to a new lifestyle will be easier if you do it slowly. So,keep eating breakfast (it speeds up you metabolism digesting food quicker) but instead eat things like oatmeal w/ banana slices in it. Or a whole grain blueberry waffle with low fat butter.     Next, try eating a big lunch to cancel out dinner. The further away you eat from bed time the better. If you do get hungry late at night, eat something without sugar,like peanut butter or a bowl of cereal. Also popcorn can be healthy as long as you don't drown it in salt and butter.    As for the exercises you could try yoga or palates. It will strengthen your core and make you a stronger person all around. (it's also very relaxing!)

I lost 25 Lbs. in three weeks and had all i wanted buy cutting out carbs But judging from what i see above carbs is about all you eat.I had plenty of energy and was never hungry. And felt better than i had felt in years.Good luck it sounds like for you it will be a complete life change.|`|eMEgu2eyaa	ok 1st of all 120 is not heavey at all for 5'5 16 year old.  my best friend is 5'2, 16 and is around 120 and she is skinny.    but if you think that way then you shouldn't eat just because your bored. i do that all the time so i know that it will be hard to stop but if you wanna lose weight then you will have to try.    you should try to exercise everyday. just run/jog around the block a couple of times.  (also i heard from my health teacher that if you do about 50 situps a day when you wake up then when you have kids you wont have that pouch that a lot of women get. it will also burn calories and will help you loose weight and will help you have nice abs).    hope ive helped.    GOOD LUCK!!  :D|`|WwCBomTMaa	First of all there really are no easy exercises, if there were exercising would be pointless. It sounds to me like you just need to firm up. Try Pilates and weight training. They can help you tone up. As for your diet, try to keep yourself busy so you never face that boredom gorging. Don't watch too much television because this seems to stimulate terrible eating habits. Also, because of the fact that you are young you can get away with eating the kinds of foods that you have been, but make sure that you get lots of fruits and veggies on top of that, and eat those foods in smaller portions. Ask yourself how you feel after one piece of pizza rather than eating four and having to undo a button in your pants. Good Luck!!|`|sosisPXbaa	people are saying don't eat this, dont eat that blah blah blah just don't overstuff yourself at any given sitting.  american portions are huge.... when i goto another country, the portions are like half the size    your main problem is that you're eating late at night.  there's no way for your body to burn off those calories when you goto sleep.  particularly stay away from carbs if you have to eat late.  and get something to occupy you so you aren't bored.    exercise is always good for your body, even if it isn't to lose weight.  helps you control your emotions better too.  just walking or running is the simple way    by the way, for your height, you aren't overweight yet.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	For your height and age, your ideal weight is between 112 and 136lbs.  You're well within range.    For many who have successfully lost weight will tell you that not only its is important to watch what you eat, but the weight loss effort will be half a success if you do not include a regular or routine exercise programme. The exercise programme shall includes cardiovascular exercises and strength training.    Cardio exercises will burn calories and lower body fat, furthermore it will also strengthen the heart and lungs.|`|AkGM8Weeaa	hh|`|qT8yID3Taa	your not fat. that's underweight for your age.|`|4JFjxElyaa	are u a guy|`|XULDCXLhaa	cardio and diet|`|iohG0qt8aa	ur pregnant|`|fYYFzRjkaa	well i know this SOUNDS wierd but trust me, yoga!!!!  it really helps  and FORCE yourself not to eat  just read a book or ssomething  you cud also go to a gym(duh!)  but ya  thats alll i got  hope i helped|`|SnqsDt1Caa	Umm same here i 5' 3'' im skinny but my thighs UGHHH    so i went to sparkpeople and they help and its free they tell you what to eat kinda and how to work out =]]]|`|ROQE2pDUaa	ur actually fine with ur weight. i go to the gym... and ur fat gets replaced by muscle...yeay...|`|NBSPVbuiaa	You need to eat more fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.  A good way to tone your legs would be walking. I hope i helped.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	missing meals makes you actually gain weight    convert what you eat    pasta/grains/breads = = = convert into fruit/vegetables. You still get carbs but at a lower cost of calories =P    drink water during jogs/skateboarding/snowboarding/or any physical activity that will make you sweat.    sleep at reasonable hours|`|SuSdQd6jaa	If you have a tred mill at home that's your best bet. But If you don't, try to eat smaller portions. Maybe jog around the block or go to the gym and use their equipment.|`|BYF3NfxLaa	I'd go with Connor.  Really try eating many servings of fruits and vegetables, even if they're in small quantities.  The important thing is that you EAT THEM.  Try jogging or walking around say the block or neighborhood.  Keep it paced and steady, and you will see results. Good luck! :]|`|6fWpUkmVaa	i love pancakes! don't stop eating those, but maybe drink  cup of OJ or a a fruit on the side.    lunch, i never ate at school either    your dinners are better than mine! keep up that    your snacking might be your problem, you can still have snacks, but maybe get chocolate granola bars. they taste great and a very heathy!|`|GRzGP7ruaa	I have been there.  I tried changing things but I just couldn't give up all that good food!  So, my friend and I tried different things.  She thought about the same with her thighs.  I gave up, because of my baby but she found something's that did work.  Skinnyboost and the Pink Patch.  She tried both of them for two weeks and got some decent results.  Skinnyboost cut her hunger so she didn't eat as much at once and just ate more frequent meals, speeding up her metabolism.  Her moods seemed more positive and her energy was also heightened.  The Pink Patch also helped control her diet and moods but instead of it being a supplement, it's like a band-aid that is very discreet.  She ended up choosing the supplement because it seemed more convenient for her.  She was able to try both because of Diettrials.info.  She got a two week trial for fewer than five dollars each.  Compared to everything else she looked at, this was the most affordable and reasonable.|`|oGMHrCcaaa	breakfast ...you can have oatmeal ,nutritious and filling,maybe yogurt or something lo cal for lunch and dinner ,maybe some baked or broiled chicken w/white rice and green vegetable for vitamins,or a baked potato w/ butter buds for carbs.you can replace junk food w/dried fruit or an apple , maybe bagged baby carrots,celery sticks.you can do scrunches  against a way or squats w/ a chair to hold on to for balance,you could walk someplace close by if it's safe to do so instead of riding .green tea is tasty and has antioxidants.|`|NKcKzPskaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, some peeple would state impossible, however the only diet which definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was featured in Fox News and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it definitely does work!|`|N6cuuDAmaa	You need to eat healthier! Try eating only one junk food a day. If you're bored then try to find other things to do, don't eat! Some good workouts would be crunches, and also try getting a workout video, they may seem cheesy but they help a lot!|`|n0TBUVnFaa	You sound like me. Except I'm fatter. :(  I wanna lose 30 pounds as well (16, 5'4, 140)  And your eating habits are like mine as well.  No breakfast, no lunch, bad dinner so my metabolism has completely slowed down.    What I'm doing... getting my bags n all packed the night before so I have time for myself in the morning - usually have cereal, or omelet, or egg whites.  Then... I take snacks to school (fruits) and have them at lunch so I'm atleast getting something.  I get home around 4 and run on the tredmill for half an hour and have another snack :)  And I eat my dinner around 7 as well - which is important! Eat earlier!  And also, drink a lot of water!  If you're tempted to have a snack... have a fruit :)  GOOD LUCK!|`|qsv4NmbDaa	eat less exercise more. not rocket science|`|IZKBRqp7aa	get some fitness magazines and look for meal plans. start now, 120 pounds isnt fat but if you keep going the way you are the weight will start packing on fast. so start eating healthy and excersizing asap.|`|1e39dc21d986e999b9cf7fb54b59088daa	eat healthy salads and other foods. dont but junk at all. run a mile once a week, like Wednesday. and also exercise. play ball and do stuff like yoga and pilloties|`|iN91UZvdaa	Eat only when you need to and make sure it is balanced.

But before you put something in your mouth, really sit back, and think...for real...."is this going to really help with this problem i have?" If not, then that's one step closer. Yeah people will say eat healthy and whatnot, but you gotta do stuff one step at a time. And thats the first step.|`|gpON465Iaa	1 hr exercise each day better to walk a mile than run a mile.  drink 7 glasses of water a day.  eat one cup of rice puffs and drink a glass of water 15 minutes before each meal and then eat less. do not skip lunch, but eat the smallest possible portion, throw the rest away - better in the trash than trashing your body.  no sugar, no salt, read the nutrition labels, cut out red meat, no cheese, substitute soy milk for regular or 2% milk - very vanilla tastes great, get your life in order it is your life nobody cares about you like you should. Pray to God.  You will be loved.|`|qvDVgwrpaa	Diet essentials:  1. 5 fruits and/or veggies a day  2. 3 dairy a day  3. 2 LEAN proteins a day.    It is recommended that you excersize for 60 minutes a day. Keeping track of hunger also helps a lot. What i do is that i check off every time i don't go to the fridge because i'm bored and that makes me feel happy for achieving that goal! Also keeping a chart of hunger like this:  7am     12pm    4pm   5pm    7pm      9pm  ___________________________________sat...  ___________________________________nue...  ___________________________________hun...  ___________________________________sta...    and then put dots on the time slot and whether you feel hungry, starving, or nuetral. I hope i helped!

CRPesW63aa	Anything in exorbadent amounts will do bad things to your health. People can even die from vitamin overdoses if they intake an extreme amount. Even water... in extreme amounts can kill.    So technically, yes, if you drink 2-3 gallons of coffee a day, it will do harmful things to your body.     But a couple cups of coffee a day?  NO. It will not stunt your growth. Your teeth? If you drink it hot with sugar, it's bad for your teeth. Any hot sugary liquid will rot your teeth faster.  Other then that, nope. Coffee is not bad for you.
Su0O55W8aa	Okay, I have scoliosis but mine is 26 degrees and mine hurts from time to time.  With yours only being 5 degrees, it shouldn't be the cause of your back pain so you need to go see a doctor asap!  Read this until then!    http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders...|`|c68nVKIYaa	Strong pain combined with blood in your stool is a reason to go to a doctor *right now* -- don't wait for an appointment. If you have an urgent care center, go. We can't possibly diagnose this over the internet.    I doubt it has anything to do with your very mild scoliosis, which is under the degree of curvature (10 deg) which is the usual borderline for classification as scoliosis. But don't take my word for it, consult a physician. I'm worried about your case, please get an examination right away. Good luck.|`|AA10020760	You need more fibre in your diet.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	please call your doctor and let them know what's going on so you can schedule an appointment to find out what's going on. please don't put this off. you could end up doing more harm than good by delaying being seen by a medical professional.    i wish you well.|`|mhLaOFZRaa	The blood is the clue that something serious is wrong. Get an appointment so test can be done to find out what is wrong.   If you are bleeding you could lose to much blood over time so please see a doctor right away.   It is very important when you make an appointment that you tell them about the pain in your back and that you are bleeding when you have a bowel movement so they can give you an appointment as soon as possible.
M7tCiP8Waa	The taper is not a good idea, people use them to jump sizes quick but you could have a blow out that way and mess up your ear forever one of my girlfriends just did that her ear is going to be screwed up for quite awhile.|`|aNmn8wICaa	you need to stretch them slowly. gauges start at 20g, which is a normal earring size. as they get larger, then numbers go down by 2. if you're at a 14g you need to move to a 12g, then 10g, then 8g, then 6g. each size should stay in for about 1-2 weeks. its alright to jump maybe ONE size. like skip from your 14 to a 10. that's not too big a deal. but if you jump from 14 to 6, your ear will rip and crack and bleed A LOT. it'll be SO painful and chances are you're ear will never go back to normal again.  tapers are meant to just help ease your gauge / plug into your ear. some people just wear them while they're stretching instead of buying jewelry in every size. which is a pretty easy alternative.    it easiest to talk to people who already have their ears stretched, and just google it and read up on it. and youtube videos help a lot. make sure you know what you're doing before you do it. it would suck to mess up your ears, cause the only way back from there is surgery.

Use some sort of body lotion on them when you get up in the morning and apply it during the day.    There are lotion/ointments made for the feet.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You might consider changing the type of footwear you use.  Look for a more open style, that offers ventilation.  You might want to try genuine leather, or cloth shoes.    Sometimes footwear that are made from man-made materials can cause feet to sweat profusely.
g6Vci5SUaa	Got to Fitday.com and register for a free account.  They have a section where you put in what exercise you're doing, how hard and for how long, and it will tell you how many calories you will burn in that amount of time for your weight and height.    Edit:  When I put 2 hours stair treadmill in my Fitday, it came up with 1,445 calories burned.  Maybe you put in the wrong amount of time?  For two hours you have to put in 2:00.  Try it again. :)|`|ScLAUvYfaa	Not sure if you've done this, but a good thing to do would be to work out how many calories you're consuming (www.calorieking.com), then you can figure both an exercise plan and a good eating plan.  A good target for weight loss is around 1600 calories per day for women (though this varies depending on a variety of factors!), plus exercise.  This is below 'maintenance level' calorie intake, and exercise will increase the calorie deficit.  THere are plenty of sites to find out how many calories you're burning, roughly speaking.  Try http://k2.kirtland.cc.mi.us/~balbachl/ca... for examply, but www.bodybuilding.com and many others can help

Instead see the doctor again and raise this issue to him.  He will do one of three things.  One, prescribe a headache medicine that you can take with your current medicine.  Two, give you a shot in the rump, embarrassing but very effective.  Or three, change the medicine you are taking for your mono because it might be the cause of you headaches.|`|AA10458195	It sounds as you are really miserable.

ETcBRko3aa	They will only put you in a mental hospital if you are a danger to yourself or others.  That means are you going to kill yourself and do you have a plan.  If you answer yes, then they can Baker Act you for 72 hours.  (put you in the hospital)    But you are allowed to talk about suicide.  The job of the therapist is to see if you are detailed enough that you are actually going to do it and what method you would use.  Therapists know some methods are more dangerous than others.|`|SG27rfSdaa	no, they won't.  These days they are closing down all the state hospitals because for one, medications and therapy really do the trick.    By getting help with a therapist and perhaps meds maybe,  you'd be hurting yourself less and less likely to try and kill yourself.    Believe me, I have a brother who is schzoprhrenic and talks to himself and no one is commiting him.  I think you will be fine, seek help for yourself.  Hospitals today are focused on money and don't keep people for long.|`|SMtTONPQaa	Trust me it all matter's about your age,and were you live.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I truly don't know of any way to eliminate periods permanently short of having your uterus removed.  However, if you have your children, don't desire any more, and are sure, they can now remove the uterus out of the vagina and it isn't as complicated a surgery as it used to be.  The ovaries would be left to produce estrogen.  You could discuss this possibility with your doctor, but insurance would probably not pay any of this elective procedure.    hope this helps..|`|g6tku4aVaa	it could happen...  extremely painful  i don't see why u would want that|`|Puygvee8aa	Not possible. Unfortunately, there's no one who would preform such a procedure for you AND if they did it probably wouldn't work. Most birth control suppresses ovulation, but you still menstruate...so the egg isn't the only requirement. You would literally have to have the ovaries or uterus removed, which are both serious procedures. Even women who have their tubes tied still menstruate.    But many women who go on the depo shot don't have periods while they're on it.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	i heard of this new shot you can get that can actually stop your period (i forget the amount of time) and i'm not really sure of the side affects and if you will even still be fertile (but since you got "fixed" it shouldn't matter) yeah i'm not sure though, maybe you should ask your doctor about it?|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	I'd leave my body alone and let nature take its course.  Oprah did a show on the effects of hysterectomies and I was shocked!  I'm 50 and still have a period and I'm glad I do!  I too, took the depo shots and it almost killed me!  Clots as big as golf balls.  I learned my lesson!
k4DxnbMCaa	Ummm...Not eating for 3 days is kinda really bad for you. Water does not have a sufficient amount of energy or nutrients to keep you going through the day. You will probably be starving by the end of the 3 days, and you probably will not get dramatic results. If you ate less over a month's time, as some diet plans prove, you will be able to shave off a few pounds. However, if you do choose one of these diets, you will have to get used being hungry, something that may bother you more than love handles and a gut combined.|`|E8go0osDaa	Not eating isn't good for you...  The best thing to do is just eat a smaller portion, drink lots of water and keep exercising.  Also, sit ups alone wont do any good...  Try going for walks or runs. Do push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks and all sorts of other exercises.    And if you don't eat, have fun trying to exercise...  You need your strength, which you get through food, just don't over-indulge.    I hope this helps ^^|`|ArIaRu5paa	you will lose weight but you will gain it back right away because you will only be losing water. what you should do is walk and cardio along with those situps. situps don't do anything unless you involve cardio exercises as well.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	nah your ******* fat as hell    do what meg does|`|wQSsw8QHaa	yes but its a bad way to do it just cut down you calorie intake every 3 days that will help you still stay in shape and have energy for the day stay away from fatty foods eat more fruits and veggies|`|qvDVgwrpaa	your crazy. not eating for 3 days will kill you and possibly make you very sick. Also, once you add back your food the same thing will happen all over again! you should do cardio excersize and not just crunches! find something fun you like such as dancing or aerobics and just don't eat before you work out and it will make you lose fat.|`|ceE9aNg2aa	Oh no, you wouldn't want to become Anorexic or anything!  Umm, sounds pretty anorexic to me dude.|`|tJa60S4Taa	I don't think that is healthy at all, you might get sick or comatose or dead... if you have never done this before.|`|hJyBSjuXaa	no because your metabolism will slow down cause it thinks your body is starving  just try eating healthy and maybe some runnig   you have to do alot more than just sit ups|`|PHY2vd6baa	dont starve yourself it will make you gain weight....what happens is when you starve yourself like that your body instictivly goes into the conservation mode where it will take any kind of food it gets and stores it directly as fat!! do a cardio workout...like running...NOT WALKING!! sit ups are junk, its proven that you cant build muscle in one particular area but if you work all your muscles out, especially when running, you will get get a lot better results!|`|gWmX70KNaa	uhh yeah youll loose more than a few pounds  but honestly that will have a preverse effect once you start eating  because when you dont eat your metabolism slows down and your body gets hungry and once you feed it you just have a slow metabolism  and yea, you can get sick    id suggest not doing just situps. cause that can sometimes not do too much. if you want to get rid of a gut  and lower stomach then do more like leg-lifts and 6inches cause situps just work upperabs    also go for runs   it works|`|8VbgGLXjaa	anorexia is proven to be the most effective way, if you could vomit a lot that would help too|`|AbggNKdMaa	It would certainly be possible to lose a small amount of weight this way, but I would not recommend it. Any weight lost in such a manner would be gained back almost as quickly as it was lost as soon as you resume eating.You shouldn't simply stop eating as the resulting malnutrition could further complicate things.    Sit ups are a good idea to strengthen core muscles, but to actually remove fat you'll need to perform some higher cardio physical activity. Just getting out and jogging for 45 min. a-day would probably make a notable difference.|`|PalExL1yaa	First, you are in your healthy weight range for your height (at the bottom actually) so be careful about losing more weight.     You can't just drink water because it is very unhealthy (your blood sugar will drop and you will get shaky and possibly faint), and your body will just go into starvation mode and actually do the opposite - it will STORE fat so that it can survive until you eat again.     In order to lose the extra bit you need to combine cardio (any kind as long as you do at least 30 minutes, and work hard enough that it is somewhat difficult to hold a normal conversation with someone), as well as muscle-building exercises (other than situps - try crunches, stability ball, core exercises and stretches).     Besides, at 107 pounds, you don't have a gut or love handles.. its skin. And you can't starve off skin.|`|ZEmSSsjUaa	Not smart, your body needs nutrients and by not eating you're obviously not going to get all the ones you need. You'll be doing more harm then good to your body. But drinking lots is good, it helps clean your body of toxins.|`|AA10771653	maybe but you'd probably get gain it back when you start eatting again|`|ebdc422563024b934f866c45a9986c4faa	You will not loose the handles by doing that.  You have to do carteo like running.  Fat burning things.  Starving your self can make it worse. Becuase when you start eating again your body will not get rid of things.|`|wxz9mmMWaa	why you want to be skinny... ur the right size.... and doing all that every night just makes your body more ache... and if you dont eat itll would be bad for your body, by leading to stomach cancer if worst! so just stop being uncomfortable with your body...|`|AA11195073	i think its a bad idea because messing with your diet can totaly mess up your menstrual cycle and can cause lots of problems, what you should do is eat healthier and exercise more, not just sit ups, but like running and jumping because running will help alot with the gut, believe me lol and also helps the rest of you look better, more of a healthy skinny, than an anorexic skinny|`|k4fd4jnjaa	Well, if you drink just water for three days you will lose weight, but it will come back just as fast. Eat healthy and you are still growing, so be patient. Maybe a little aerobics 2 times a week ,lots of water, and keep up on the sit ups 210-WOW!!! good luck!!|`|4lwKokybaa	NO!!!!!!!!! Go a gym or a dr. They can tell u what to do. Not eating can give u potentialy life thretening nutritional disorders and make you look like a skinny freak, u will also pass out.
VAHxoStlaa	My mom told my dad. I think it's just a parent thing. I don't know who was more embarrassed about it though....me or him lol!!|`|OpduZC3Eaa	It's no big deal really.

It's normal and expected in a healthy relationship for your mom to be open with your dad, especially when it comes to there daughter = YOU! Try not to be to embarrassed.. it's ok! =)|`|9huxAcK9aa	Well, although i'm not going to say that that wouldn't be embarrassing, but he knew when you were born that you would get it one day!  Ask your mom if she told him, and if she did, ask her to respect your privacy with your body.  I know it sounds weird, but I hope she will understand.  As for now, just ignore it.  If you try to talk to him, he may be as embarrassed as you, or worse.  He might bring up the sex talk! .............................    Good Luck!    Talk with your mom!|`|sGWVQcQmaa	honestly, i dont think he is embarassed about it  - when you get a few years older, you will realize that it is just a fact of life and will not be embarassed about it at all.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your dad is a grown up man that has been dealing with women with periods for many years.  It is just another bodily function like peeing or bowel movements, not something strange and offensive.  Men know as much about periods as we do and they don't think anything about it unless we have PMS. LOL  Your mom probably just wanted him to know his little girl is growing up and after all, he is your Dad.    welcome to womanhood..|`|P1bO87l1aa	It shouldn't bother him one bit if he knew you were having your period.  He is married so he should know and expect things like that.  There is nothing at all wrong with him knowing|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Oh now Ariana!  Stop being a big baby!  He's your FATHER!  His wife and his mother had periods!|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	You do know your dad has seen you naked right? He used to change your diapers.    You should not be embarrassed by your dad knowing this in my opinion.|`|175XmxsPaa	Your parents have a right to know. It's a big deal in your life. Just pretend he doesn't know and go about life.|`|AA10020760	It doesn't really matter. He knows you will have one just like all females.   Don't you think guys know about it?|`|hWFF4hq9aa	I dont think so the only person that should know is ur Mom and maybe ur older sister|`|qMu6Tdrhaa	Its perfectly normal! She wants to tell your dad just incase if you get a suprise attack and your mom isn't home and you need a pad. And he would know about periods and stuff too, so it isn't awkward for them, and it shouldn't be for you.|`|Rx0ae0suaa	I assume my mum told my dad when I got my period, if she didn't then at 24 I would assume he thinks I have it by now. But it's not a topic I would bring up with him, no need to.|`|AA11447210	There's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's a normal female body function and he's well aware it happens to women. He's got as much right to know you are healthy and your body is functioning as it should, as your mother does. Besides, seeing feminine hygiene product wrappers in the trash, and observing your moods change if you experience PMS, will be a clue anyway.    Guys know about that stuff and most (esp those with some maturity) aren't bugged or grossed out by it at all. Relax.|`|j5U44juiaa	My mom did the same thing.  It's nothing to be embarrassed about.  She just told him because it means you're becoming a woman.|`|7p0TO6ePaa	no you dont have to tell him unless you only live with him. then you should tell him because he would find out anyway you know. my mom just told my dad so i didnt go through all the embarrassing stuff. good luck|`|9Tqzhn5raa	step dad? no. its none of his business. i don't want my step dad knowing ****. he has already ruined my life enough. not by marrying my mom though.|`|AA10358331	It's alright! Your dad has had to deal with your mom having a period for a while now. He's use to.. You don't need to share details with him. But its good for him to know that your are growing up healthy.   My dad knew.. we never talked about it though|`|I2xILJtraa	yeah my mom told my dad and i just pretend he doesent know and it doesent become awkward|`|FgahTFoMaa	lol I had to tell my dad cuz at the time i was in cuba so he needed a reason to why i couldn't swim  i told my aunt though cuz i needed some pads  lol and this was only a few months ago|`|4mkKoYn6aa	hey be happy she told him,      i know i am dang happy when my wife told me our daughters where having their blood moon i know to be more careful with my energies, and to give them their wanted space, when it comes times that they are out for blood and i am more forgiving of anything they say or do or trow, i try to keep water going all day for teas and pretty much become a ghost in the house for their comfort the first time thou ouch i should have known with my oldest daughter i totally messed up because i did not know we still have problems because of it thou with her younger sisters i have been more mindful so be glad your dad knows and he is mindful

K1YJzwSYaa	No yr not, me n my bf has made a pact to not let go of ourselves my bf is a chef!!> which has its perks but luckily he is very active and when I notice a squidgy I tell him and vice verca.     When he yr bf next time says anything about overweight ppl, you should explain to him how to he is being hypocritical and make a point. You need to be able to tell him what you like (in a bloke) tell him you can't imagine goin out with a overweight person and you like him the way he is.... make a joke outa it.     Also do things active together, and make it out as if your trying to keep yr figure. . . and ask don't you want to so that too etc etc.    But overall you need to build yr relationship to the point you can criticise him as well if he's put it on a bit of jelly he needs to know - at the end of the day it is also for his own benefit.    Goodluck|`|6vJQduumaa	umm u could like ask him to go jogging with u or somefin like that.try and tell him to eat healthy food. i don't think u r really wrong,i mean u r doing him a favour.it is really bad for hsi body if he is over weight and eat's lot of junk food.try telling him to come to the gym with u or do exercise with u like for fun so u won't hurt his feeling.and it might even be fun.lol hope this helps|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	If you got fat, how would he treat you?    Tell him to knock off the chips and burgers, and to be sensible, or you'll have the You Are What You Eat woman around to him.|`|ZcAvP92jaa	well his health is most important than his looks just tell him he needs to stop eating junk if he wants healthy life|`|UNCVt1yLaa	i understand you and no one should judge you for being honest  tell him you have noticed btu don't go on about it  because even though you may be just saying  saying it more than once and you will be mean  im sure they will remember the first time|`|fsIwP86Saa	- If you have kids, get him to take them and play football (or any other sport) with them.   - start doing the cooking.  - do the shopping, so he can't get bad food.  - make him weigh himself so the next time he says something about a fat girl say, "yeah she must be xx stone". xx = his weight or lower. Don't worry about hurting his feelings as it was him who began the critisising.  - Just tell him.|`|xJzT2uEfaa	since you don't want to hurt his feelings, you could try to get him to go on walks with you (that way it will just seem like you two are spending good time together instead of exercise)....also you could tell him that you are trying to eat healthier because you want to live a long and happy life and see if he would be willing to do it with you so that you don't have to go it alone (and you could also say that having junk around you will only tempt you and you don't want to be tempted to eat something bad for you so that it will make it sound like this is all about you)....    well good luck to you (and worry, you don't sound mean or anything) :-D    By making it sound like you need it, you won't hurt his feelings and you will most likely get him on board with you since he won't want to jeopardize your health and by doing that, he won't be eating all that junk and he will be getting some exercise....(and the two of you will be doing this together which always makes things better)|`|8SRjELNBaa	Go on a diet together, go to the gym together and make a lifestyle change together.

There are no cures for flu, you can only ease the persons suffering with supportive care and wait for the body to fight the germs.    EDIT    If she's throwing up I would ignore the advice above about taking Advil as it is ibuprofen which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine that can irritate the stomach and bowels.|`|rA9jh8Twaa	Maybe Nyquil and rest. and she needs to see the Dr . to make sure it is just the flu.  Ask her to be calm as the flu is a major pain but it does go away.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Super pro tip: Go to a doctor    Failing that, take 3 panadol (or other paracetamol tablets) and suck some lozenges|`|F5i78q4Vaa	drinks lots of water, get lots of sleep somewhere quiet, try to keep some food down, take advil|`|UbB5qnX9aa	Tell Her She Should Soak A towel In Water And Lay Down And Relax|`|AA11993638	The "flu" is a virus, and there is nothing that will cure it other than to let it run its course. Some things that might help are 7up, dry toast, or once in a while a clear liquid like broth. trying to get rest is also a main point of helping your body fight the virus. If she has a high fever and the vomiting subsides, the other thing she can try is to take a hot bath, about as hot as she can stand it, this will help the fever do its job and help it break. she needs to bundle up and stay warm.|`|og5nVmu6aa	it sounds weird but either 7 up or rootbeer helps me!!!! hope she gets better!!!! :(

K4zsztkRaa	what do you mean?    durring sex or masturbation.    Sex it's fine, everyone does it at some point it's not a big deal. You are never sapposed to tell a girl that you do it tho. That's a big mistake.  If you are talking about masturbation then get over it.  Masturbation and sex aren't in comptetision they go together.  No one will think of the same persn with sex and masturbation forever. I don't care how much you love someone it just doesn't happen.    I don'tknow how it makes a relationship better, but I do know that it happens in every single on by both people whether or not they like to admit it.    I love my boyfriendmore than I love my life, but I have been guilty of thinking of someone else while we do it. I'm sure he has too.  It doesn't mean I don't love him or he doesn't love me. Or that I don't find him attractive or he doesn't find me attractive.    Girls take things too personaly, don't.  Girls get sex and love mixed up way too much.    I guess guys are guilty of it more than girls, but it's okay.  There is nothing wrong with it, you just have to know it doesn't mean anything against you.    -Connor|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	Not sure how that would help... sounds like a slippery slope to me.|`|yZqRYFsPaa	depends on your age|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Whatever tickles your pickle ?|`|mnFG19Ukaa	it heightens your horniness?|`|JiJwxr1taa	If she has it,she has it.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	If your partner isn't exactly what you'll call Sexy, then imagining that she is a sexy lady can really help in your performance.

CRPesW63aa	If your afraid to ask your parents, maybe get a doctor's appointment, for say, A school physical, and talk to your family doctor. They can suggest a way to get the help, and even tell your parents for you if you want them too.    There's always a way to get help, it's just a matter of asking for it.

ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	well if you thought you felt it, your pants were pushed down, the blankets were off, etc, then i really do think he did it.     one of my friends was raped in her sleep (she was knocked out because she was drunk) and she knew it happened because she was naked when she woke up, there was sperm on the bed, and she felt really weird.     i really doubt you would undress yourself, turn off a fan, and take your blankets off while you're sleeping. plus you said he was the only other person home... i really do think he molested you  and i'm so sorry that happened :(     you should talk to a counselor even if you don't feel sad or hurt about it anymore|`|YRsCMVvnaa	Going on what little information I have, I'd say you were assaulted.

You either are a victim of abuse and are in denial trying to make sense of it and haven't come to terms with it...or you ARE confused and need to find out what happend and get it right.    You need counseling...please go.  You won't get it straight until you do.    You might not know....I was in denial about my uncle for 40 years...so please don't think you should know etc.  You might be repressing them and think you are wrong to avoid facing things.  People should not judge you if they haven't been through this.  MANY women deny it when this happens to them as children...it is a way to survive.  But it always comes out...it will fester.  Please ignore these people when they say you either know or don't. THAT IS NOT TRUE.!!!!     When you are a child you trust people that are supposed to love you.  You don't believe they would do anything to hurt you and they tell you they love you.  They ACTUALLY do love you...so how can they hurt you?  Children are easily confused and don't consider it abuse...their minds don't work that way.  Children blame themselves and think it is something they did as wrong.  MANY children have behavior problems by trying to deny things...and many can contain it and bury it for years and years.    PLEASE go to counseling.|`|085DXX4Qaa	OH Nevermind, I misunderstood what you said!  Sounds like you are in denial about what happened.

AA11447210	All a doctor could tell is if you used something that did damage. S/he wouldn't know how the damage was done, without asking you though.     Be careful about sticking objects into your orifices that aren't designed for that function. There are adult toys made for such treatment than can be easily cleaned and don't have sharp points/edges that can hurt you.

Just take like tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain. Try not to eat anything hard like chips or pretzels, until your mouth toughens up. Try like soups, jello, yogurt, mashed potatoes - soft foods, until you feel like you're ready to eat solid foods. After you get started eating solid foods, it's not bad at all. You're going to get food stuck between your expander and the roof of your mouth, just make sure you get it out. They told me it could cause infection. Your speech will be different for awhile, at least until you're used to that big plastic thing in your mouth. After awhile, you don't even know it's there and you're talking normally. Some words are hard to pronounce, but that's about it. I have a lisp with my S's, but it'll go away once I get it out so don't worry about permanent speech problems!

At your age, have them removed to rid of the pain. They will grow and cause nothing but issues and unnecessary pain. Most likely they will occur again at sometime in the distant future. When removed completely, it should take care of the problem. Be sure to check your fingers for these cysts. Surgery:  would be 1/2 - 45 min, with an arm block, recovery is faily quick at your age, less then a month. I would seek a **good hand specialist/surgeon** for this (This is their field). Good luck - MD- in plain English    PS: You will not be able to see them with a flashlight. They are in the small joints of the wrist, or fluid within the sheath that surrounds the wrist tendons|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Go into a dark room with a flashlight.  Turn on the flashlight and hold it directly on the cyst.  If the cysts illuminates, glows, then it is filled with liquid and is not likely a solid mass.    If it does not illuminate, then you need to see your doctor.      A cyst can be drained, or surgically removed.  They do tend to return.  If its causing pain, your doctor should help you decide how to deal with this condition.
AEAxZEveaa	I had terrible anxiety and depression. Debilitating at times. And it turned out to be a symptom of celiac disease.

There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	you should talk to a counselor|`|AA11579568	You need professional help, a doctor or counselor. Your school should have resources if you don't think your parents would be willing to help you.|`|VK9tBggYaa	aww )= this sounds really sad.  well, since counseling didn't help, why don't you turn to a doctor? keep your head up, you can make it! try to be optimistic and make the best of things while you still can. and work hard to get to college. it will pay off.     a good way to get a friend is to find someone lonely and shy like you . try to say hi to some people. yea, some people are just mean and they dont care about anyone else but their selves, but some are really good people. if you cant talk in person at first, ask for an email or something and you can talk online, which is .. reallyyy easy. if you feel like you need to talk to anyone email me! okay? don't do anything stupid like kill yourself.    ooo_angie@hotmail.com    (yep, i know, weird, im on yahoo but i use my hotmail email more, haha)|`|AA11122207	you need to have a psychiatrist and a therapist and you might even have to make a trip to the psych ward!

God, exercise and positive thinking. Thats the only things that will help your situation. Good luck... I'll pray for your life... Just don't commit suicide- you have your whole life to straighten up. Don't give up now.|`|824Md65waa	First of all just relax.  You can get through this and suicide is not the answer.  I don't think you want to go down that route either because underneath what you just explained, I feel that you do still cling to the optimism of wanting to change, which is an excellent start.  I am not sure what counselor you are seeing, but maybe you should try a new one. Sometimes it takes trying out a few therapists to find one that you click with and that inspires you to surpass your issues.      Aside from pursuing a better therapist, I think you need to find some sort of social activity (perhaps outside of school) where you can meet new people without worrying about seeing them later in the halls, etc.  That might help you to overcome some of your shyness and anxiety.  Sometimes there is so much pressure at school to "fit in" which may just contribute to your issues.  Perhaps you should consider volunteering for a local charity or at a museum.  This will introduce you to many people of all different ages and backgrounds.  I think you will eventually find that there is no reason to be shy and most people are never judging you the way that you perhaps think they are.  I was once a very shy person and still can be from time to time, so I understand how hard it is to open up.  Sometimes you feel like people are thinking "oh why is he acting like that" etc and in reality, they aren't.  Over thinking just prompts your anxiety and makes you feel more socially awkward then you actually are (like in movies when the outgoing jock is tongue tied over talking to a pretty girl).      I think you should also pursue going to University.  There are scholarships, student loans and financial aid programs that can help you pay for the education.  It will be a worthwhile experience and may be instrumental in helping you.    Life is beautiful.  Good luck and hang in there.
K7x1RHVFaa	You are internalizing all the violence you are seeing in your life and placing yourself in the role of the killer because you want to be the one in control while at the same time you know that such behavior is wrong so you are conflicted.

e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	Just ignore that stupid thing. It's on the treadmill at our gym too.     Take the number 220 and subtract your age. So, say if you are 20, the number you get is 200. Then find 60 to 80 percent of 200. So that's 120 to 160. That should be your target heart rate to burn fat. You can burn fat fastest by doing circuit training - run on the flat treadmill fast, then incline the treadmill and walk while lifting small hand weights, lower the treadmill and run fast, repeat, etc.

Better off letting your body get some germs so your immune system can get exercise.
Z0SiMz7daa	It should cover this.  Do you have a doctor?  If so, get an appointment.  You will need a referral to a surgeon.

AA11993638	A cold will take 3-7 days before you know you are sick, it is caused by a virus, and not matter what you do it will take its course. Not dressing warm enough or going out with wet hair or eating cold foods will not make any difference in a cold or give you a cold. The key to not getting sick is washing your hands often. Cold viruses can be on any everyday item you may touch and if you then touch your nose, eyes, or mouth you will pass the virus into your body. If you caught colds from being under dressed in the cold weather, I would have had one for the entire winter as I used to go out in jeans and t-shirt, sometimes only clogs on my feet, and I know people who wear shorts year round in Michigan, and guess what, they seldom get a cold.|`|3pfhWdRKaa	Both you and your mother are right. Once you catch a cold the virus goes through an incubation period. During this time you don't show any symptoms. Three to five days after you caught the cold you will show the first symptoms. Most of the colds we catch we dont even know about because we never become symptomatic - our body handles the infection without us every knowing.    About that cold thing, your mother is sort of right. Once you have the common cold virus in your body (which is quite a likely occurrence) the virus is dormant waiting for the opportune moment. Going out into the cold under dressed or drinking very cold liquids briefly compromise your immune system and let the virus do its nasty work.
OpduZC3Eaa	Sounds to me like you need to get a second opinion from a doctor. What you're describing sounds like a possible cyst in your ovaries and yes this can be painful and very uncomfortable! Do some research on Google and see if you can find anything to point the doctors in a different direction.

Robo has a doseage of 2 tbsp totaling 30mg of dextromethorphan (DXM) and varied other ingredients.  If you took DM, the extra is guaifenesin (200mg).  Cf: pseudo-ephedrine (30mg) unless the switched to phenylephrin.  So, lets double everything because you double dosed...  60mg of dxm, 400 mg of guaif or 60mg of pseudafed.      Compare to mucinex generic @ 400mg guaif per dose, youre fine on that but may get slightly nauseated.  60mg of dxm:  people regularly take 300ish mgs of this to trip.  no side effects up to about 100mg if youre a lightweight.  300mg is for 200 lbs.  60mg of pseudo:  this is within the limits.  There are pseudo pills with 120mg per dose, however side effects of long term use include liver damage.    Short answer: youre fine.

fk9AvB25aa	Most of your body fluids dry up but you can get urinary tract infections or even bladder infections if you don't clean up and you might smell a bit stinky.|`|a3ZZkY08aa	yeah and you'll smell like sex|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	He's correct!  Bacteria can go into your urethra (where you pee)  I'm not even going to discuss what if you had anal sex
Puygvee8aa	Your vagina is probably just one of the more wet ones, to be frank. As long as there's no itching or foul odor...it's perfectly normal. I had much heavier discharge during puberty than I do now. Hormonal fluctuations can affect it.|`|PndrZ2Utaa	ok hunny, this is normal... just really uncomfortable haha  if it has a bad oder it could be an infection, but most times it is completely fine!! :)  xoxo|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	Sounds likes normals vaginal discharge.

AA10299265	Having diabetes is not necessarily having your pancreas shut down. It's true in the case of type one diabetics (10% of diabetics), but that's not how it necessarily works in us type twos (90% of diabetics). At least, that's not how it starts out. It's more of a function of insulin resistance.     Now then, to answer your question. Doctors don't know what's happening exactly. If they did, there would be a cure. Usually what they tell you is that something isn't malfunctioning (pancreas or insulin receptors in the cells) and leave it at that. They don't have the time or inclination to properly explain it. Their job is to treat you as quickly as possible and move on to the next paying customer.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Your pancreas is shutting down, in a nutshell.|`|G6ZCpYwYaa	I had this symptom when i was first diagnosed with diabetes, i was only 8 years old, but my mum noticed that i didnt have any energy would drink a ridiculous amount.    I also get these symptoms now when my sugar levels increase.    Ignore the comment above, your pancreas isnt shutting down, its just your body giving you a warning, i suggest you go and see your doctor as soon as possible, or check your blood sugar level (if you have a machine of course).    Hope this helps.    (if you need anymore help, im happy to help)
vqEb6rVpaa	Im really not sure what it is...I know you don't want to go to a doctor but I think you should. It mite be serious and it mite be nothing.

When it becomes inflamed it is called bursitis. The fluid provides a cushion for the joint of your elbow. There is usually no need to go to the Dr., your body will absorb the fluid as your elbow heals. Usually about 7-14 days.|`|AA11829667	You injured the bursa sac and may or may not need the doctor to drain it.
iSmIA9MZaa	maybe u shuld show pics cuz they might just be freckles ir sumthing
2dilmEjoaa	Well from my experience to get "bigger" you need to do HIGH reps LOW weight.    So for instance if you could do 35lbs 10x's on each hand for 4 sets.. get if you can a 50-60lb dumbbell an do that 3 sets 5xs each hand..if you keep doing that everyday you will get bigger guaranteed but you also need to have a good diet or else whatever you do won't help you 1 bit, take my word on that. An for triceps do "diamond pushups".    Hope i helped =]
QAf8qF5faa	it is natural to change at this sort of age but as it is so sudden i suggest that you try to sort it out.    try to sort out any stress in your life you can, talk to your parents and teachers and they may be able to help you sort out things like struggling at school or with homework.  talk to your friends about anything that is upsetting you, talking is one of the best things you can do.    talk to your doctor, they can help with insomnia.    for the bags under the eyes i have heard using a frozen damp facecloth for 5-10 minutes before school each day can help.    as for the grades talk to your teacher, explain about your insomnia, (s)he may be able to allow you to retake your test when you can sleep at nights.    i found that lack of sleep was the first Sign of depression, it is nothing to worry about, but speak to your doctor about that too.    sleep and wake up at a regular time each night and ensure that you are worn out during the day. also leave 1 hour before bed to relax and wind down.  sleep without a light at night.  milk can help too.|`|HpktQMylaa	uhm don't take this the wrong way but you're in 8th grade and that kind of explains everything you just said  I'm a junior in high school now but what you just described is exactly my 8th grade experience I basically stayed up all night and left my math class like everyday to make myself throw up and cried like all the time but I was actually fine I just sort of did that stuff just to have something to do  and I guess I can't really say what's going on in your life or anything but if you just try and sleep and don't over analyze or worry about stuff too much you'll be fine|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Doctor...
ULx2vAB1aa	just talk to her about it if she feels comfortable. she obviously trusted you with this secret, so don't go around telling everyone. she not in any danger of killing herself, at least that's what it sounds like to me. i don't think she necessarily cutting herself, but i think she likes the marks. do not tell a teacher or a school counselor, because they will report her. just talk and help her find the root of the problem. if she doesn't want to talk, then just leave her alone|`|1jS20kGdaa	she might be looking for attention just talk to her.|`|KyAjmaOyaa	Try to make her feel better, because cutting own arms is not normal.  You never know if something serious can happen because she is cutting against very important functions. Ask her why she is doing this and try to give her a good answer and help her to get over it. It's important that you do something because it's your responsibility that you help her out if she has told you something is wrong. Also ask your parents for advice, and maybe tell her parents maybe?.. It's a serious thing that can potentially turn into death. God will help you.|`|kMiq1wqpaa	I think she's just looking for attention to be honest.  Most people who cut themselves keep it a secret  and don't show it off and tell people?|`|AA11681445	While I agree with Taylor, I think that if you were to tell someone, it might let her know that she always has your attention. I had a friend in middle school who did the same thing and a few of her friends, me included, went to the counselor. She was mad at us for about a month, until she realized that we did it because we cared about her. Don't let your friend hurt herself. Even if it is for attention, what better way to show her that she has your attention than to ask like a concerned friend?|`|AA11122207	YES! This is a form of "cutting".  And, maybe she is doing it for attention. But, I think it may be deeper than that--- she may be depressed and thats her only way out-her release from the pain she endures on the inside!  I know exactly how she feels b/c i'm a "cutter" myself!   The only difference is that i don't do this for attention! I do this b/c i need relief from  the mental illness. Like, seeing the blood come down off my wrists make me concentrate on that and not my problems for a little bit! I know it may sound psychotic but thats how i or even how your friend may feel!  I don't know her whole story- so i can't really say for sure. But it does sound like she's suffering from depression and may also be thinking of suicide too!  If you are such a great friend of hers i would suggest you help her get help! Talk to the school guidance counselor or call a suicide hotline, if its that serious or just call 911 or go to local ER. In the long-run this may just help her! And, you would feel better that you helped her out too!  Good Luck! Hope all goes well!
qqNxUxPNaa	I was in a car accident last week and hit my head on the steering wheel.  My doctor believes I suffered a concussion.  Your symptoms sound very similar to mine.  There was nothing the doctor could do about the concussion and he told me my memory would get better with time (Its just a little fuzzy right now, I have to write everything down)  I wouldnt worry about it unless your symptoms change, get worse or dont go away within a couple weeks.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	You probably need to see a doctor. You need a PROPER diagnosis and prognosis.
kMiq1wqpaa	No i think it's stupid to miss school because of a cold.  It's called kleenex and cough drops.  oh and hand sanitizer.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Yes, you need to stay home.  If you don't, other people will get sick.  If people at your school get sick, then you risk it getting spread back to you when you're feeling better.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	You should go to school.  Just take the medication you need before you go to school to get you through the day.  If you have a job you would be expected to go to work or you would risk losing your job. You are sick enough to stay home from school but you are not sick enough to go to the doctor.  Go to school.|`|0S5qfrncaa	Yes! Who doesn't want to miss school?|`|Qd26D4kiaa	I think so, because if you go to school you are going to spread your germs around to all your friends and make everybody sick.
VCIZJQCJaa	i will try to give you some info. BUN ( IF LEVELS ARE HUGH)caused by high protein levels,kidney damage,low fluid intake(so if she wasn't taking in fluids before the test,the levels would be high) intestinal bleeding,decreased enzyme production(IF LEVELS ARE LOW)low intake of protein,mal absorption or liver damage......CREATINE it's level reflects the muscle mass(low muscle low creatine(most skinny kids will be low ) also not enough protein or liver kidney disease.HIGH levels of creatine could mean serious kidney damage that requires monitoring.there is so much to evaluate and rule out it may take a visit to a pediatric nephrologist,to rule out kidney related issues.hope some info here gives you something to ponder.
2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	the vicoden could be making things worse for you. you might be allergic to it. i am. it made me so sick i ended up throwing up and as a result dehydrated.    anyway if your head is hurting that severe you need to have someone take you in to see a specialist. the shot of toradol should've helped get rid of your headache by now. my blood pressure was through the roof and it wasn't caught by my regular doctor. but instead when i ended up in urgent care.     when you went to the hospital did they do a CT scan? if not, you need to find a different hospital to go to. you really should have some tests done and not just be given an injection. it's not ok to have a headache lasts this long.     i pray that you can get the help you need and quick.|`|BjviQHuUaa	hang in there...you can get through this.|`|uMTk7lwWaa	Could an anerysumn, go to the ER NOW!!
OpduZC3Eaa	I am always happy to have my cycles. To me it is a great blessing and a beautiful part of being a woman. I think society has created it to be a bad thing and something to consider an embarrassment and an annoyance. That and some religions looking at it as something dirty and sinful. I think that is all ridiculous! Anyway, my guys always know when I have my cycles that way they know to keep aware of some of my moods and to assist in more of my comfort. I have always used tampons so there was never a problem with sleeping or much of anything else when it comes to messes or anything like that. I use O.B. tampons because they are the most convenient for me and the easiest to use. They give you more control and what not. Everyone is different and it's best to test out a few brands and see which works best for you, it really is an individual choice. Absorbency is based on individual needs. Every cycle is different. For me personally I always purchase O.B. Multi-pack, that way I can have access to the different absorbency that I need throughout my cycle. I don't set my alarm clock to wake up at certain times to change but I do use a new tampon right before I go to sleep and when I wake up I change it to another one. It's no big deal really once you get the hang of it.|`|tShWlEjnaa	shove a cork in it :P|`|18OKU8ENaa	Being "on the pill" helps sooo much!

Ir51Eb0Kaa	Walking/running is really good ?|`|PBMZKeXoaa	well if you want weight loss you are doing the right thing cardio is the most important kind of exercise. I wouldn't worry about lifting weights and if you still want to you must push it to absolute failure so like of your benching then you do on your first set say 10 reps. Make sure you cannot complete another one. Rest for like 2 min and then you should only be able to get 8 reps on the next set. 3 sets is best. The same goes for other exercises like bicep curls, shoulder press, seated row ect. Make sure you give yourself at least one day of rest in between muscle groups so do 3x biceps till failure then 1 day of rest.|`|0S5qfrncaa	I would highly recomend the treadmill and situps!  You will get awesome results!  Ps. You may also want to go on a diet too, for best results.|`|z4m5LV2raa	I think any kind of exercise will help you to lose weight, provided you team it with healthy eating, eating plenty of fruits and veges and making sure that you drink plenty of water (2 litres a day).|`|eBHsUiYOaa	that works, that's also the best way to do it, make sure you drink plenty of water. If you can keep it up, good; that's going to be your determining factor as to whether or not you lose weight.  I'm just going to say this, your 15 and the male stops growing around 27, and the female body stops growing at 23 ish (I'm not sure if your a guy or a girl). Don't worry too much about losing weight (muscle ways a lot)  But to get in shape, that should do it, If you want to build fast muscles (the ones for heavy lifting, the ones that make you look huge) lift high weight.    what ever you do, get proper form, and I mean it, I wasted 3 years not having proper form, get a trainer for at least one day at the gym so you don't hurt your self, and you get the maximum work out. they will also show work outs you have never thought of.
XjEMhJ0Raa	Cut out junk in your diet, drink plenty of water,  while maintaining a steady workout routine. Dont do the same thing everytime but switch it up. Also eat healthy, and get plenty of sleep. Avoid sugary foods and drinks as well as fatty foods. Especially gatorade which does more harm that good.    FOR WORKOUTS: First work on your general fitness, you can target muscle groups with specific workouts, which can be found online and other places.  If you have a gym membership:  Stretching for 5-10 min  Olliptical Machine(much easier than running for starters)  Do some stretching afterwards, and move onto getting rid of those love handles.  It is important to maintain consistency so start with an easy workout of alternating sit-ups and plank, or iso-ab.  4 X 25 crunches  4 X 30s plank  4 X 25 crunches  4 X 30s plank  If this is too hard then substitute difficulty accordingly.  Good Luck and remember to keep at it, you definitely wont see drastic results right away, BUT this is the only way to really get into better shape and look better. Dieting HAS AN ADVERSE AFFECT SO DONT do that.  -Christian M|`|TFfgskH0aa	i would like to be of service to you.

I take Anefrin sometimes when it really bothers me.  Might help for you too!  Its a little pricey, but it works wonders.  Just make sure to follow the directions PERFECTLY!  If you use it too often, your sinuses will become "addicted" to it and wont be able to function correctly on their own.    Also, when I have a cold (people are gonna think this is gross) I shove toilet paper up my nose to help make it stop running/clear it up.  It works pretty well if you dont want to take pills or nose sprays.  Obviously, do this in the privacy of your own home.  Haha.

73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Same weight and height as me. Yeah, underweight, but not too bad. Try tracking your calories to make sure you eat enough, and try to get to at least 95lbs (that's what I'm working on lol)  Good luck!|`|v14XlT6Zaa	Not at all. I was the same at that age...

Avoid eating too much junk, as this could have bad consequences later.  Instead, try consuming bananas, as this is what residents in old folks are given to increase weight.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	For your height and age, your ideal weight is between 90 and 112lbs.

T3cGj2bHaa	You'll lose 1 or 2 pounds per day fasting with just water. Make sure you're drinking at least 8 glasses. However, if you don't break the fast carefully you will gain it all back easily and quickly. To break the fast without gaining the weight back you need to eat only raw fruits and vegetables the first day after fasting and then gradually reintroduce the foods you typically eat (try and keep it healthy).    I recommend you do some research on healthy fasting, first. I know it's become a fad, and a lot of people seriously misunderstand it, so make sure you get all your facts straight. Check out this website: http://cinque.getwebspace.com/facts.html    Good luck!|`|5I7Ifrmraa	OMG, I am so sick of these questions.  Get off your lazy butt and work out.  Dont try and cut corners.  Not eating for 2 days is not going to help, try being freaking healthy.  Eat more fruits and veggies.  If you think you need to loose weight, be healthy ALLLLLL the time.  Dont try and do some stupid crap like not eating for 2 days.  GEESH!!|`|lrzv2a5naa	well ive been sick the last 5 days so i basically didnt eat anything and i lost 8 pounds but it wasnt really fat atleast i dont think it was cause i dont see any difference.  so probably like 3 pounds but i dont think its really worth it.|`|qm9xrYiqaa	dont know but would like to know to|`|RZXuQq5Baa	You'll lose 2-4 lbs, but mostly from water. And you'll maybe get a size smaller.|`|bjgKzYCyaa	im gonna do the same.  so we'll see.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	I wouldn't recommend it .. you'll just gain whatever weight you do lose right back once you start eating again.  You may lose 3-5 lbs. possibly and that will we water weight.  You will go to the bathroom a lot more.  Try a sensible diet -- more fruits and vegetables and exercise more.  Even this does not have to be a grueling exercise routine -- walk the stairs instead of taking the elevator.  Park your car farther from the mall door and walk.  Take your dog for a walk in the evenings.  Go to the park and walk the track.  Get off the computer for an hour a day and do something physical.  It will help you feel better about yourself and you won't worry so much about what others think about you!|`|YlLdIPRvaa	This is not really a good plan because any weight you lose on the liquid diet will be gained back when you go back to solid foods.  I would recommend eating less and moving more if you want to lose weight.  Plus, it's not good for your body to lose weight over short periods of time.  Pace yourself.|`|TeoTd5gNaa	MAYBE 10PDS.

631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	With due respect to your mother...you've gotta break away from her dominating ways.  I have tried to live my life for other people, and live up to society's expectations...and it will make you MISERABLE.  I don't have to be a genius to tell you that.      Seriously, though...I can't tell you what to live for.  You don't have to live for other people, and you don't have to live for your career.  Maybe you should do something that feels a little crazy; change your major?  Or, maybe just explore things you're not used to doing, something you've always wanted to try...Who do YOU want to be?  You can be anyone, absolutely anyone (or at least, strive toward that).    Yes, it's true that we're all going to die someday, but that doesn't make this existence pointless.  We just have a time limit.  Even if you don't believe that we continue on after death, you can grab some amazing experiences for yourself.|`|rbGoxvI6aa	I feel the exact same way. I do not understand relationships at all because I feel like we never really know anyone. I do not want anyone to know me. I imagine different lives and jobs I could possibly have but I do not want any of them. Maybe we should see a professional. If the medication doesn't work...well lets wait and see. But I guess we should try because even if I don't particularly care someone cares about me and I owe it to them to try meds first. Don't you agree?|`|eXGrrRLkaa	holy **** i feel the same exact way.  your right, you go to school to get a good job that you spend your whole life doing just for it to amount to nothing in the end.  society's ideal image is a great job & family where everyone is oh so happy..but of course it is never really like that..why must they frown upon those who don't want to get married or have a few children?  i am not in a relationship and i do not feel like i need to be in one. like you i have no sexual desire. i do not like going to school(i'm still in highschool) & i do not enjoy normal activites. i have no long term goals and i'd much rather have fun my whole life instead of work and raise a family. my highschool is doing nothing for me except causing me many problems.i don't see why people believe that in order to succeed in life they must be in a relationship with a good job. sure money gets us what we want.but for me, any way of scraping up cash to get myself a little apartment and some things is fine.|`|KyAjmaOyaa	First of all, I want to thank you for using such great language and grammar, it definitely shows you had some education. To begin with, you have asked what is the point of life when we already are going to die... Let me tell you this, at one point of our lives everyone asks themselves that question. I have, and found an answer. We can be the most smartest, wealthiest, famous people.. but without looking at life with a good conscience, we sometimes feel like this. You are already a successful person as I see it, but you also have to be thankful for the opportunity to have such a good life and education. You have to look at the people who don't have a good home, clothes, food, education, who don't have family, who are suffering with diseases and traumas and such. You have to look at the people who were not fortunate as you to be able to have all those things. After you have understood that, start helping out! It will make you feel better, I promise. When I mean 'help out', I mean doing things like donating money to the poor, helping a poor old man on the street, volunteering to do good, and just simply do good things. I am a Christian and I have thought about my life after death... God has sent me here for a reason, and I have to follow his commands and have a good lifestyle.  There is a life after death, but where you go, is determined by what you do here, on Earth. I have some similar feelings and emotions as you have described about relationships. My friend, you do not have to have a spouse or kids... It's an extra to life for me, but I do not think it is necessary. Focus on you education right now, because it is more important to you. Don't always look how society is, we just have to follow our own conscience and make decisions based on if we think it is right. Society right now is definitely not something to look at. We have so many evil things happening right now with homosexuality, abortion, pornography, basically everything that is violating the ten commandments. Do what you think and know is right. God watches over everyone, and knows all. In order to reach Heaven, which is infinitely better than anyone can merely think of it being, is by having a good life style and also helping people. I can totally relate to you, because my mother also happens to be like yours. I understand her situation, and know that parents only send you to education because they really love you and will do everything to have you successful and happy in life. I love my mother, although she seems to be like yours.. haha. I hope you do all well in life, and I pray to God that you will be happy throughout your life!.. God Bless!|`|CRPesW63aa	The point of living, even though we all die, is to be immortal.     Einstien is immortal.

Living without a legacy, isn't living at all.|`|HTgQagiAaa	interesting, im 16 and have never had a relationship either. but i want one really bad, but while i may not completly agree with your point about relationships i do understand it. the point of life is to live it to the fullest while were still alive. And who knows you have to open your mind to the possibilities, im not saying i believe in re-incarnation, but it is something to consider, anything is possible to me, even if humans were to live forever, then would there even be a purpose? If your still looking at it the way you do i wouldnt think u would think there would be because you would still be doing the same thing with your life. in my opinion just live to the fullest and be whatever you want|`|Fmeiu9PVaa	Whatever your college major, that doesn't pin you down for life as to your job opportunities. Many, many people change careers at least once during their life (including me).    It sounds like you have a very controlling mother, and the sooner you get away from her control, the better for you.     You should feel free to believe whatever you wish about love, relationships, sex, etc, etc. Hey, it's your life! My advice, which you will undoubtedly not follow, is to read the New Testament Bible, which is the best instruction manual for living that has ever been written. Maybe you'll find some answers there.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Your soul is eternal. What you do in this life determines your fate.

But most antidepressants cause an increase in appetite. This is not intentional it is just the make up of the antidepressants. There are some that don't cause an increase in your appetite. This is something you will need to discuss with your psychiatrist if this is the reason for your increase in hunger.|`|u0j1KywNaa	i think that food is really comforting to a lot of people and its one thing that u like when u hate everything else. so, i think depression does make u hungry. but, if ur really depressed sometimes u just dont even want to think about food.
OpduZC3Eaa	I don't think a heart murmur has anything to do with stomach aches. If you both are very concerned then I suggest you see the doctor ASAP!|`|AA12268495	Stomach aches have nothing to do with heart murmurs.     Is she having diarrhea? Nausea? Vomiting? Is she running a fever? If so, then yes she should see her doctor since it has been going on for more than a week.     However, whatever the issue is, it is not due to her heart defect.|`|OR5PhU40aa	I don't think they could be related, unless the commotion from the heart murmur has stressed her out and she developed an ulcer, although this is unlikely.    Take her to a doctor, though -- just in case. It's sweet that you're worried and taking care of her, though. Good luck, tell her I hope she feels better.|`|2sXqm4u9aa	Heart murmurs just don't go away.  They are monitored and treated when necessary.  A bad stomach ache is not necessarily connected to having a slight heart murmer.  The pain is a sign that something might be wrong that needs to be addressed by a physician and checked out with various tests.  It could simply be the type of food she is eating, could have a ulcer or any number of things which can be handled easily with medication or diet.  It could also be a sign of a serious problem.  GO TO A DOCTOR NOW - It could also be a sign of a serious problem.  Err on the side of caution and get tested.  It's probably nothing major.

W2z5dCrmaa	Kieran M Dude    Your body is working beautifully and just the way that you want it to. To damage the responses that it is doing would be so wrong, but for sure you want thing to be right, and to not scare her or be embarrassed by your body giving away that you are getting turned on.     One thing that I did when I was around 15 was hold something so that she couldn't see my bulge, and then I would discretely slip my hand in and with out hurting it, I would move my gear up under the gentle waste band of my boxers, toward my belly button. It was safe there and it couldn't be seen, and by the time that it relaxed enough to go back down under the waste band on it's own, there was a slight bulge for a short time as it move back to it's resting spot, but only a bulge that just looked good, as healthy package, and didn't shout.."BO NER"!   Haha!    Wanting the best for you Man    Me! :- )|`|6chLhNJhaa	Eww!!! Why do we need the girls name????...Anywho...u a wierd muthaF@ $ |`|MhfneF0xaa	Kieran,    This is absolutely and totally normal.    Your erections are much more obvious to you than they are to Jess. And if she notices, so what? Most girls would take this as a compliment!    I understand that you feel a little bit embarassed by this, because it's probably a new situation for you, but please remember that this is not a conscious act on your part, it's a reflex, and if anything, it's a sign that your body is working normally, and that you find Jess attractive.    I would suggest trying to find a setting where there's not a lot of light (Noohhh, duhhh!) and you might want to "arrange your package" so that it's in a position where it's not prominently displayed, but really, this is not something to worry about.    You're a guy, she's a girl, and the fact that you are concerned about this shows that you are a decent guy, and care about her feelings.    And again, although you may be *very* conscious of your erection, it doesn't show nearly as much as you might think.|`|C7baXdSZaa	Girls know that us guys get hard and cant help it just dont try to hide it because then it get awkward but dont be like sticken it out there|`|sPNVcK3aaa	think of and old lady with saggy titts haha|`|C60j5rhtaa	Same thing for me...

That will do the trick!|`|VWTuZaVYaa	just stop thinking about IT..act normal..  its impossible for little birdie to harden all the time..  and there's no way to hide it unless you take a pit stop at the men's room..|`|nKosOzuVaa	She more than likely won't notice it unless it's touching her, and if it is touching her? Then why hide the fact that you find her very appealing? She'll may be flattered and even better, curious.   If she's not? You can't control it, right? You are very attracted to her, right? Say so, be honest, tell her that you're sorry, you wish you could control it but you can't and what it means is that you're extremely attracted to her (telling her she is the only one who does this to you will earn you points, too.) Practice saying out loud before your date so you can speak confidently  :)|`|ntqVD7Ataa	Wear basketball shorts things. Like in degrassi.|`|0JERmAslaa	dude dont worry she might take it as a compliment|`|68r4mmOnaa	Hey,  getting an erection could be a good thing. You are still growing. Getting an erection means your muscles get bigger. And when it does, over time, your penis will get bigger.     One way to stop it is to just try not to make it look obvious you have one, or if you have an oversized shirt or sweatshirt, try to cover the area. Another good trick is to go to the bathroom, flick it,  it goes away in about 30 seconds.

PfE6bg5iaa	Three weeks heavy bleeding, nonstop? You should probably make an appointment or atleast call your gyno and ask!     How often do you have to change your tampon? If it's less than every two hours, see a doctor asap... that's too much blood loss.    Good luck|`|5RoYyprkaa	Contact your doctor, although when I first started birth control, I bled nonstop it seemed like for a month. My doctor changed my pill and everything was fine.
emNCaAq7aa	Find another gym or do your work at home. You can actually hang the barbell from chains and a rafter. Then if you go heavy to failure the chains hold the weights.  That is the problem I see with your using the plate holders for a rack. You have to work to hard to get the bell up there when you go to failure so you can't get bigger since you are staying low on the weights.  I, and a lot of real experts agree with not using a Smith machine. The lack of range actually makes it dangerous for a lot of people's knees and lower back.
6SJ8QHKcaa	Lay on your stomach or lay flat on your back!  Believe it or not, people go to the hospital thinking something is wrong with them because of the pain only to be told it's GAS!  It happens to more people than who are willing to admit.    Try Gas-X or Beeno (if you have access to it)  Otherwise, try these two methods.  It should work!|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Um, no that sounds like appendicitis.    You need to go see a doctor.  Or take gas drops, if they even make those for adults, to see if those help.|`|23Sn1zbHaa	it's not looking good in your future|`|qQSbdcVYaa	yes, you are able to.    and there is nothing funny about this question|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	If you're having severe gas pains, first you need to be taking simethicone(Gas X and the ingredient of all gas tablets.) It loosens the gas and allow you to expel it. You can pass gas while you're sleeping, but you wouldn't know it. The best position is to lay on your stomach. While awake, if you get on your hand and knees and wiggle around some, that helps too.    However, gas pain can be miserable, but if the pain continues, it may be something else and I'd see your Dr. Gas pains shouldn't last for hours and if the pain continues longer than that there may be an underlying problem. Try my suggestions and see if it helps. If not, make a Dr's. appt. A simple stomach X-Ray can show signs of something else.|`|YRsCMVvnaa	It is possible to pass gas in your sleep. I suggest sleeping on your side. Also if you can, get someone to gently massage your stomach, as this will help relieve the pressure.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	i dont know that there's any particualr position that helps, but,  i would drink alot of water to help flush out your system|`|dKq7DZkbaa	I get like that every now and then. I have found the best thing to do is try to lay down on your stomach, or on your side with a pillow against your stomach. The pressure feels kind of good.  Try to take a nap, when you wake up you will feel much better.    I'm not sure if you actually pass the gas in your sleep, or if it just moves to another area that isn't so painful, but you will feel better, I promise.|`|YIdSOyKBaa	yes and i often have pains like this as well, usually its either because of me eating unhealthy foods, diarrhea, or possibly when im bloated. ive been bloated one time in my life and ive got to say that it was the worst day of my life i had sharp, painful, stomach pains, i must've threw up over half a dozen times, and spent nearly three days in bed with a fever of nearly 106.|`|wvrMda78aa	no its not funny, if it hurts that bad, like horribly bad its not gas! It could be your appendix u need to go NOW and get it checked or it could burst leaking poison through out ur system!
L6zgCGUZaa	Well, noone really knows for sure, because people who have died from it (have experienced the full symptoms!) havent lived to tell the story, evidently! But my friend took an overdose and she was in hospital for just over a week, her kidney and lungs and just basically most of her internal organs were slowly shutting down on her, and she said it was a horrible mistake, and she had to have her stomach pumped but they were too late to get it all out so just had to leave her body to fight against it, and she pulled through and is still alive and well now.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Depends what you do. If you chose the right one, you fall asleep after getting really dizzy and feeling like you've got to puke.|`|84crzC80aa	I think you pass out and either - get your stomach pumped - or your kidney's shut down - and you die of organ failure.
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	It could also be tendinitis from the shoulder. There are a number of bones and joints in the shoulder area that will affect this and your arm. It could also be from your neck and a bulging disc. The way to address this is to see the doctor and let him make the decision as to what it is. He can give you a cortisone shot to help heal and make the pain subside. Maybe an antibiotic for healing.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	First of all WOW you are beautiful!!!!  and back to the question,, yes you could have arthritis but it is more than likely not that.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Ovulation occurs 14 days before the start of your next period if there is not an egg implanted, so you are really at risk.  If it has not been 72 hours, you could purchase Plan B at any drug store and take it to prevent pregnancy.  However you need to keep in mind that sperm can live inside you for 7 days, so that increases your chances of conceiving even more.    hope this helps..|`|dALX1qQdaa	you ovulate BEFORE your period, the red bloody stuff is the lining of the utrus. it makes the lining waiting for  a sperm to make a baby and when it doesnt get a baby, the utrus comes out the vag. sorry if that was graffic|`|P1bO87l1aa	Generally the mid point in your cycle is when you ovulate. So with your short cycles you probably ovulate around day 10-12.  So if you have a five day period. You had sex on day 7 it may be close.  to be sure wait until 5 days after you ovulate to have unprotected sex and then no more unprotected sex after your period ends.  My wife had 28 day periods and we had no unprotected sex from day 7-21.  We never had an unplanned pregnancies.  But everyone is different.  I would talk to an OB/GYN and ask their opinion.|`|d29M7lGKaa	14 days from the end of your period !!!

It really works.  Or if you don't want to spend any money...Put a towel on the floor, lay on your back, put your hands firm on the ground and lift both of your legs at the same time, go as far up as you can go, and do as many as you can.  Make sure you are using your stomach to lift up your legs, NOT your neck.|`|PBMZKeXoaa	go jogging or biking and drink plenty of water its simple but it will work.
mhLaOFZRaa	With arthritis when a joint gets warm and sometimes swollen it is because of inflammation. When you have inflammation that is when you get the damage to the joint. That is why you have to take something that helps get rid of the inflammation.    If I were you I would go to an Ortho that advertise that they deal with knees only as they would be the one to really help you.     I will tell you that my son FELL and hit his knee and it was warm and swollen for over a year. He had gone to a general Ortho and he kept saying there was nothing wrong, but maybe he was getting arthritis. He finally went to an Ortho that only deals with shoulders and knees and that doctor did exploratory surgery and found he had small pieces of cartilage that had broken off from the fall and that was what was causing the problem.   They had to cut off the ragged pieces of cartilage, clean out the knee and he had to have therapy to restore movement.    You don't say how old you are but my sister has trouble with her knees getting hot and swollen and now she is scheduled to have knee replacements soon.    Better to get another opinion to make sure that is what is really wrong with your knee so you don't continue to suffer.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	It is warm due to increased inflammation, very common with arthritis.  Can take some anti inflammatory medication if the doc prescribed some for you, or can take some iburprofen OR aspirin which are both anti inflammatory medications.
OpduZC3Eaa	If I were you, I would just get up some cash and walk or take the public bus to the store. Either that or ask a friend or a family member to drive you. No big deal once you start using them, it can take a little bit to get the hang of it though. Yes they absorb just as much if not more and they are more convenient and cleaner from what I hear in comparisson. I have always used tampons myself so I can't honestly make that kind of comparison.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Well, since your 15 do any of your friends have their drivers license already? Maybe they can drive you to the store. Do you have your own money?     Also, you shouldn't be embarassed to ask your grandma. If you went with her, would you be able to direct her to the grocery store?    I suggest just keeping an eye out for a quick opportunity with your mom alone. I understand not wanting to ask infront of your stepdad. I was mortified one time when my mom and stepdad went shopping and she bought me tampons while they were out together!    Or, you could write a little note tonight and leave it on her pillow. You could write that you're almost out of pads and you were wondering if she could get some for you. Also, that you'd like to try tampons because pads are icky and ask for some teen ones with a plastic applicator in addition to pads! As for the drifting, you can also write that you're going to miss her when she goes on her cruise and ask if the two of you could go shopping for a couple hours.    Good luck hunny, it's hard with a new addition to your "parental unit" and I'm sure your mom has just been so busy that she doesn't even realize what she's doing. Remember, she loves you and your brother no matter what!|`|5RoYyprkaa	Tampons absorb just as much, and it's alot cleaner than sitting in your own stuff until you change your pad. Do you have any other female family friends that you trust enough to ask them to take you to get tampons? Or maybe an aunt or a friend who uses tampons? It's pretty easy, but it may take a few tries before you get it in comfortably. Just relax... Talk to your mom when your step dad isn't around.|`|OR5PhU40aa	I'm in the same position as you; fifteen, never tried a tampon. I've heard they're fairly easy to use, you just have to insert it in far enough, and if you're not able to feel it, then you're doing it right. Just be sure to replace them frequently to avoid getting Toxic Shock Syndrome (that's one of the reasons I haven't used one yet, although it's unlikely that it will happen).    As for your mother, tell her how you feel. Honestly, there isn't anything easier than the truth. Ask her to take you to the store (alone) and talk to her about it in the car, and don't forget to wish her good luck on her cruise, just to stay on good terms.    Good luck!!|`|jYBl7AVQaa	Just tell your mom that you want her to buy you some tampons before she leaves because you are about to start your period. You should be able to find some time when he's not around to be able to ask her. They should have some in the nurses office at school if all else fails.|`|47b56e7446888d86d8acbefdbb1a37a5aa	I was the same when I was your age. I was wearing pads and mum got me to try tampons. They are much more comfortable than pads but if you're period is heavy you gotta watch out for leakages. For the first 2 days of mine i wear a tampon and a pad just in case of leakage. They're good for swimming too.Start with mini tampons when your period is finishing so you can get used to inserting them. Now for your next problem... you've got 3 days until you're mum goes. tell her tonight that you're gonna need some supplies before then!  And ask her if you can have some time with her when she gets back. Go out for lunch and a shopping trip or something! Its normal for your mum to have less time for you now. I know from experience that it's so hard as a mum splitting your attention between all family members! It's not easy! Treat her well and she will do the same. Let her know you're gonna miss her when she goes away (even if you won't) !! It'll let her know that you want a good relationship with her.   I hope this has helped you somehow!|`|Ui3KcDajaa	Call her into your room and say can we talk  and tell her u want to try tampons ,but just in-case get pads and ask her to take u to the store before u leave so u can get what u need Just u and her.....but if u do get tampons try Playtex Gentle glide 36 ct so you have enough left over for next time  their the best but that just my opinion|`|YtjygFACaa	tampons absorb as much as pads do.how close to the store are you?you could possibly walk there and buy them if you have money!  i would talk to your mom maybe when she is cooking!do you not like your step dad or do you just not want to say something like that to a guy?!
dBoUYNY5aa	I have hypothyroidism ( under-active), I am on 200mcg Thyroxine a day. It doesn't make you lose weight, just regulates your metabolism so that you don't gain any more. I have found the best way lose this weight, I have lost a stone in a year, which is not a lot over a long period of time but it has been lost slowly and provided I still take my meds i will carry on losing instead of gaining. I always take my Thyroxine before breakfast which is what is recommended, and eat no more than 1200 calories a day, and I try to keep very busy so that I am burning off more than I am putting in. Hope this helps!|`|TtOCh3JSaa	I have a underactive thyroid and put on 2 stone before it was regulated by eltroxin. To be honest, it stops you putting on any further weight but the weight loss isn't alot from it. You need to work at losing it yourself. It's a hard thing to deal with but the eltroxin gives you more energy and more of a lift. I've been on it for 2 years now and I'm still trying to shift all the weight gained!!|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	You will stop gaining, certainly.  Whether or not you lose is up to you and your eating/exercise habits.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	a little on your own but it will be easier.|`|ea42eb25a8abec1d31b842b732c7d5e2aa	it should help  but it's not like you're thyroid will get better and then all of a sudden you wake up skinny  and you probably won't loose a ton, but it should definitely help!|`|OR5PhU40aa	Yes, but you'll have to lose most of it on your own.    Mine is slightly overactive, and I stopped losing when I went on a medication.|`|0fwiToNoaa	I initially lost a stone when I was put on thyroxine, but still had to lose a lot on my own. You won't just wake up skinny! If part of your weight gain is down to eating too much choccy and not exercising enough than it won't simply fall off!

riFDDdscaa	Both statins both poison. Lipitor is typically prescribed in larger relative doses but since the piddly 1% benefit is not dose or cholesterol level dependent, the added strength (or dose) just adds to the side effects. In my research, the really horrific side effects, seem to occur with Lipitor. My numerous side effects really took off when I was switched to Lipitor from Zocor.   Pharm dude, I never heard of a drug company proving that their drug was no better than their competitor. Seems like a waste of money. Yet CBS was able to discern an advantage. Really, CBS, is that what you call a reliable source? Even the drug companies have never proved that lowering cholesterol has a direct effect on CHD. It states that in all their advertisements. The 1% benefit is very repeatable but never tied to lowering cholesterol. The most likely mechanism of action seems to be an anti inflammatory effect. This appears to be confirmed by the latest Crestor study, where they gave Crestor to patients with normal cholesterol, but elevated C reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. It still reduced events by 1 person out of 100.. Those clever drug companies say this is proof, we should give their drugs to patients who have normal cholesterol. Of course, they stopped the study before the negative effect on the immune system could show an increase in cancer deaths.   Side effects that I personally experienced= depression, memory loss, muscle pain, tendon pain in ankle, hand and hip, stomach problems, sleep problems, eye problems, extreme low energy, argumentative (seems to be permanent), low testosterone, very short term amnesia.  Why do people spend up to $1500 a year for such a small chance of any benefit?    Pharmacist who's life was almost ruined by Lipitor|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Lipitor|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I don't think it is a matter of strength but what will work best with your body. Only your medical provider can determine that.    BTW I am on Zocor.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	they are both good but zocor also has somethign that can cause the gums to remove from the teeth and that isn't good so we changed but they are both very good meds and the doctor will tell you but you need to keep on of them|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	They're both statins, so they work equally just like Zetia.  If you want stronger control, you need to ask for Vytorin which is Zetia and Zocor.  Zetia stops the intestines from absorbing cholesterol and Zocor keeps the liver from producing so much cholesterol.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I dont know which of those 2 is strongest...I was put on Crestor which was supposedly the newest and strongest Statin...its only been available in Australia about 2 1/2 years.|`|ca954c919a2476f1473248ad8af00947aa	Liptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! trust me I've took both,it rocks your numbers down~!|`|29WFvvNPaa	Lipitor, known to have a lot of side effects though.|`|VYUQnz6naa	There isn't a "stronger" medication between the two, because they are different drugs.    However in the category of effectiveness the edge goes to Lipitor. Both drugs are very effective in reducing bad cholesterol (LDL) and raising good cholesterol (HDL). Both Lipitor and Zocor belong to the class of drugs known as statins, which lower cholesterol by blocking the enzyme in the liver that produces bad cholesterol. In a recent study done by Phizer the producer of Lipitor, it was found that Lipitor was no better at preventing major heart complications than its leading competitor Zocor. However CBS found that Lipitor outperformed Zocor on several fronts such as lowering cholesterol and preventing nonfatal heart attacks.     The only problem is that Phizer still holds the patent to Lipitor until at least next year (2010), so it's brand name only and very expensive. Zocor has gone generic (simvastatin) and is relatively inexpensive.

If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner.

AA10202389	It seems we always want to be entertained and waste our time with busy work. We always want something going on. What's going on is junk off the top of our heads. Meditation, ooo, that may be almost the first time I've used that word in an answer, but meditation, among other things, is opening the conscious mind to possibilities we had never thought of and feelings we seldom feel, our humanity. People seem to be afraid of 'nothing' and have to fill it with something and block everything, everything new, fear of the unknown, I guess. In those down times, times of emptiness and even trouble, is where our growth seems to come. It's then that we deal with issues we should, feel feelings that are part of our humanity, listen to our intuition and our "whole brain thinking", it's sometimes when we are at our best and just don't know it. The reason we are told to not be judgmental is so we can be open to creative thinking, bias is so anti-reason, although there's a time for everything. This is a time for reflection and change of direction. Time to "Know thyself" as the prophets and psychology would tell us. Time to look up the relatively new subject of Emotional Intelligence, so emotions don't run us, but we run them. A time to think about the thoughts behind our feelings to see if they make any sense and if our feelings make any sense. And to find our inner direction. Science is saying that the vision logic of the subconscious is the tiger and the conscious mind is a monkey on it's back.   What to do? Look into Emotional Intelligence, spirituality, intuition, feelings and other information we need to handle life. People ought to mope around and change direction from the craziness they are perpetrating all day long. That's only the start of an answer, but Yahoo is no place to write a book. This answer is just an introduction to life, which is more important now than all the gadgets we spend our money on, the the wmd's, but spend too little on the humanities, learning what it means to be human or on the intellect, maturity and enough common sense not to use technology to destroy ourselves. "Go within or go without" the sages say. Angst is just the self that we keep neglecting asking for atttention, telling us we are going the wrong way. You need to love yourself, listen to it, help it to develop, evolve mentally, but we don't want to hear that. Tell me another lie, give me another toy. Reason and useful knowledge are our best toys. Your aware of your mind right now and it's not your enemy. Make yourself at home. Deal cope and have fun. It's an amazing world not something to be too afraid of. You just have to learn your way around. Others may spend the winters with ninnytendo, but you can spend a little time learning something better. Your mind and the universe seem to be calling you to better things.

fc6c6d98a843c15862389c029ff47a3caa	For a woman it is a very overwhelming feeling, and maybe she just doesn't know how to deal with it. If she isn't really making you stop try to keep going until she reaches orgasm. I doubt she will be mad at you for it. Maybe she's embarrassed because she "squirts" as you put it. Make her feel comfortable by talking to her about it.    Also, how do you know that when she tells you to stop she hasn't already reached orgasm? Does her body get tense and then kind of collapse? If so, guess what? She came, and after orgasm a woman can be VERY sensitive down there & might not want you to continue doing the same thing you were doing to get her there. Make sense? As a woman you don't have to physically "squirt" to have had an orgasm. As a matter of fact I don't think I've ever "squirted" although I have reached orgasm. It just depends I guess, talk to her. She's the only one that can really answer this question for you.    Good Luck!|`|AA12268495	I agree with Ms.Independent ~ she has probably already had her orgasm and is very, very sensitive after wards. My husband & I have this same issue ~ if I am using my hand on him, he likes for me to continue after he has had an orgasm ~ says it still feels good. However, my experience is that it is almost painful for him to continue touching me after my orgasm. It just becomes soooooo sensitive I can't take anyone touching me there for awhile.     Regarding her  "squirting" ~ a woman is normally pretty wet throughout the sex act ~ it makes all the difference between pleasureable penetration & incredibly painful penetration. Although some women do "squirt", unlike men it is not a part of her orgasm and shouldn't be confused with one. It is just an oddity that can happen from time to time.|`|SiSplXXsaa	This actually isn't uncommon; less than fifty percent of heterosexual women can orgasm with penal stimulation alone.

It feels completely different from when a man orgasms and a woman orgasms...|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Maybe she wants to prolong it. Until she can not handle it anymore and then orgasm.  Or she does But she doesn't say she is havin one.    Im sensitive after I orgasm but is usually when my hubby is doing oral sex then I can take it anymore because Its just to sensitive down there.  You really need to talk to her more A vague  asnwer wont work this time. Tell her how you like pleasureing here and If she already had an orgasm doesnt mean that you are going to stop doing stuff to her.    I use to dont tell my B/F that I had one because I want him to keep going. I know ;) Hehehe.    But he told me that and I as like relief.    Well the squirt you talking a woman is usully wet through all intercourse but when they orgasm It a bit different but it will really depend. If she gets wet easily or not.    I hope I helped. Talk to her more seriously. And if she doesnt want to well make her undertsand that is important for both of you mak her fell confortable. And you are married know you are soppuose to be best friends. At least My husbad its my best friend.     Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!

0344b14c2b9cf6ff627da4b38cfdcf39aa	Stuttering gets worse when you are tired, under stress, with any extreme emotion, and when you try NOT to stutter.

AA12335331	You need to take time and visit with the doctor a little more.  Also, you might ask the doctor to recommend an urologist who could continue to check further into your concerns.  I was also hit at around age 13. lost the testicle totally and have spent the rest of my days with just one.  I am 66 now.  Several things to keep in mind.  The testicle could stop producing sperm.  That is not critical since one testicle will produce more than enough sperm to get your future partner pregnant.  Besides not producing sperm the testicle could be so damaged that it stops producing testosterone (the essential male hormone)  that is not to bad since you can get male hormone shots if your testosterone levels get to low.  The testicle could atrophy where it shrinks, gets really small or may even be absorbed into almost not existing.  No here is what you can do.  Ask the doctor to do a sperm count and then have one done a few years from now.  You will need to masturbate into a jar  in a private room at the doctors office and then give the nurse the semen sample.  The doctor will look at it and count the sperm.  He will not be able to tell exactly if the damaged testicle is not working but he will be able to tell you if you have more than enough sperm to fertilize an egg.  Also, have the doctor run a blood test for testosterone.  Again he may not be able to tell of the damaged one is not working if the good one has taken over producing a little more than normal since it's partner has stopped or slowed down.  The remaining testicle may grow a little larger since you are in puberty to sort of compensate.   If after the scan the doctor feels that it needs to be removed then you have an option that was not available for me 50 years ago.  You can ask the doctor at time of removal to put in a fake one.  Yes they make fake testicals so that when they are put in place a person looking or touching your privates could not tell that one is missing.  Lots of men with one testical father children and if special attention is needed there are a lot of fertility doctors that can assist.  The absence of one testicle will not change your sexual attitude, you will still get horny, you will get as many erections as ever, and you will still feel like masturbating and having a lot of sex.  You will lead a very normal male sex life.  As for the person who did this take time to let him know the damage he caused and that you do not appreciate having to live with this the rest of your life.  This could be done in the counselors office at school with a parent present.  I have spent the last 53 years of my life telling young men and women how serious it is to kick or hit someone in the testicles and it is not something that should be done unless you are protecting your life from harm.  I hope things work out for you and if you need to visit more about this feel free to email me via the answer connection.  I will answer all questions.  Good luck and be safe.  Sounds like your doctor has things under control you just need to have him answer your questions so you can make decisions later in life.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	My boyfriend was injured when he was 17, and is now 18. And he can not have kids, but his injury was way more serious than a kick. So you shouldn't worry about it.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	If one testicle is not operating, the other one will still produce enough sperm to be able to have children.    Each testicle produces way more sperm than you really need in order to be fertile, so losing one doesn't really hurt your chances.    But it sounds like your testicle isn't seriously damaged anyway. So either way, don't sweat it.|`|mRExprCMaa	I think you will be alright :]|`|AA11522944	It is highly likely that you will recover fully.  Testicles are amazingly resilient to knocks.    If the absolute worst happened (which it won't) and your left testicle did not function any more you will not be infertile because your right testicle will still do the job.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Don't worry dude, there are a lot of one-nut wonders around with loads of kids. God made two for a reason; you only need one working to have kids. Relax and enjoy...|`|u8CFwtyMaa	The reason that we have evolved (or were created) with 2 of our important bits (testicles, ovaries, kidneys, eyes, ears etc) is so that if one stops working, we can still use the other one to live our lives fully.  There are lots of guys with 1 functioning testicle that have children, so you should have nothing to worry about.  As you said, if the doctor was worried, you would have had your scan earlier.  Hope this helps

Look at the things that are good about yourself. When a pessimistic thought comes across your mind; stop, acknowledge that it is only a thought and thoughts can definately be changed, and think of a better thought, implant it in your mind (say it a few times even if you don't believe it just yet), and move on with what you were doing.     Plan goals for the future, even if you don't know how you'll get there... just know that you have things to accomplish in life and you're worth being alive!!     Its also OK to be a loner and be misunderstood. Some of the greatest minds in history were chronically misunderstood.      I can tell from your word usage and punctuation that you are intelligent and use your mind. So work with yourself on being more positive. I know I say it like its so easy but trust me on this... the mind and the thoughts that go around in it can be changed like building any other skill in life. It will just take a little effort and good intention on your part. You've already begun. Good luck.|`|11426a3fb135256eff3d1cf09ba85994aa	I know that therapy sounds like a corney option, but if you find a compassionate, intelligent therapist, they can help change your life.    I have found that focusing my energy on other people helps sooooo much.  When ever Im depressed and doing sef destructive things, the last thing I want to do is volunteer to help other ppl.  But when I push myself, I find that my mind is completely distracted away from myself and I feel so much happiness.      Good luck.  I will keep putting positive thoughts your way xx|`|6qsocyK3aa	Know the feeling (honestly I do). Best thing for you to do is get yourself to a doctor where he/she can refer you to a therapist.They will be able to talk you through your feelings and help you understand yourself better which is the key to feeling calmer. They can also teach you to counteract your negative thoughts with positive thoughts (it's called CBT or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - ask your doctor about it). Your doctor might also prescribe you medication if they feel it would benefit for you but don't expect results from that straight away. Good luck hun. x|`|sMSXWPWgaa	This isn't the place to get advice about this sweetie. I'm answering so you'll have at least one positive response before someone says something really crass.  Everyone has dark periods, just some are darker than others and some people are better at coping with or even hiding them. It helps to talk them through, even if you can't find a definite solution, it's a weight that gets lifted when you share it.  Do you have someone you can talk to? Ideally it'd be your parents.   I'd really suggest going to see your doctor, they can get you help such as counselling. It really sounds like you suffer from depression. Things can be done about it. you are not alone.  If you feel that you don't want to talk in person yet, please call a helpline. I don't know what country you're in so can't suggest one, but google it- you need to talk to someone.   Good luck  x|`|JMdFjr2naa	Cut your life into pieces  youve reached your last resort, suffocation, no breathing  Don't give a **** if you cut my arms bleeding  Would it be wrong, would it be right  If you took your life tonight, chance are that you might  Mutilation out of sight and I'm contemplating suicide  Cause your losing your sight, losing your mind  Wish somebody would tell you your fine  Nothing's alright, nothing is fine  your running and your crying  you never realized you were spread too thin  Till it was too late and you were empty within  Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin  Downward spiral, where do you begin  It all started when you lost your mother  No love for yourself and no love for another  Searching to find a love upon a higher level  Finding nothing but questions and devils  Cause your losing your sight, losing your mind  Wish somebody would tell you  your fine  Nothing's alright, nothing is fine  your running and your crying  you can't go on living this way|`|MoLQsZeXaa	just calm down and look on the bright side     if you ever want to talk just contact me on jacknddy@aol.com i will then give out my im|`|C8Dk5hGiaa	You are a lot like me.

The fact is, if its an option for you do this, then its likely that you will.  Will Smith said in a recent interview when ask how him and Jada  Smith has been able to stay together all these years.  He simply said "When divorce is an option then it becomes and option"...Put simply, he and his wife have remove this decision from their future.  This is something you should consider in your own life as it relates to hurting yourself in the future.  "JUST NOT AN OPTION FOR ME"    As for your anger, one can just say...remove anything in your life that make you angry.  Well I don't really agree that that's is the best solution.  You are getting so angry because you either can't deal with the stress of confrontation or you are completely desperate for attention at any cost.      I would focus on quality of life so you can concentrate of what important to you.  When you begin to focus on the things that make you happy then all the other things that make you negative will begin to mean less to you.|`|UDwbU66eaa	You ever heard of 'The Opal Project'? They specialse in self-harm for young people, and adults too.They can send you out a special journel to write your thoughts in (because it's the thoughts that start off the harming,right?) www.theopalproject.co.uk     Also try www.selfharm.org.uk or www.nshn.co.uk (national self harm network).

zwsdYR3Vaa	Progeria     Progeria is an extremely rare genetic condition where symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age. About 1 in 8 million babies are born with this condition, and most affected children usually die at around 13, although many have been known to live into their late teens and early twenties. It is a genetic condition, but occurs as a new mutation (sporadically) and is not usually inherited, although there is one unique form of the condition identified in only one family in the world that is inherited from parents who carry the protein genetically. In this case, five children in the family had the condition.    Scientists are particularly interested in progeria because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging.

So I did some research and found this electrical stimulator device called the "Alpha Stim".  It's a small device with ear clips that you clip on your ear lobes at night for 20 minutes.  What it does is send a small electrical current to your brain telling it to produce seratonin.  That's the natural chemical we all need to feel good, sleep well, etc.  Depression and Stress usually blocks the brain from producing seratonin and that why most people go on Zoloft or Prozac,etc.    I have had my Alpha Stim 8 months now, and couldn't be happier with results.  I did a lot of research on it before I asked my doctor to write me a prescription to purchase it.  What sold me on it was it is used by our Military Hospitals for our returning wounded solders with post traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, pain, etc.    Everybody deserves a life free from depression!

There are a variety of different causes for esophageal dysmotility - problems with nerves to the esophagus, problems with the muscles, physical changes such as narrowing or widening, or changes to cells that line the esophagus.      Given your daughters other problems, acid reflux seems a likely cause in her case.  Reflux causes gastric juices from the stomach to leak up into the esophagus.  Over time, the acid can cause scarring, inflammation, and physical changes in the esophagus that make it hard to swallow.  Sometimes this effect is temporary and it goes away soon after the reflux problem is solved, sometimes the changes are not reversible.  The doc can insert a scope into her esophagus to determine the nature of the problem.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Food moves through the GI system, being pushed by smooth muscle contractions.  Dysmotility is a scary word, but it just means that food is not being pushed as easily as it might be.  I'm sure your health care provider can (and should) explain this better and make suggestions on how to deal with it.  Please don't worry.

What many people don't realize is that this cannot just be done overnight! If you try to make drastic changes in your diet too quickly, chances are that you will only be frustrated and disappointed with your loosing that belly fat.    Also, there is more to weight loss than just diet and exercise. In this article I will give two great Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat.     1. Avoid self-sabotaging train of thoughts: Self-sabotaging thoughts will do you more harm than think. Just imagine, if you always think that you cannot do the things you need to do in order to lose weight, how can you ever loose that belly fat? If you think that you cannot do sit-ups and push-ups, you are probably jumping to conclusions and being too overly self-crital even before you have tried any exercises! If you think that doing thirty push-ups is too much for you, then start small. Start with 10-15 push-ups, and thank yourself once you have done it successfully! Then try to add one or two extra push-ups every day to your routine until you reach your target of thirty.     You see, when you start small, it becomes much easier to reach your goals! Instead of thinking too much about it, just take action and DO it! The amount of time you spend on thinking and criticizing yourself, you may as well as spend it on some exercise. While the former will do you no good, the latter will help you burn fat and loose that belly fat fast!     2. Get help & support: Proper support is important in order to keep you on point and motivated. Without support, you won't be able to lose weight successfully. That is why it is essential that you enlist the support of your friends and family who understand you and support your goals. It is also essential that you choose a weight loss program which offers support to its members in the form of a support group or forum. In a forum, you will get support and tips from your peers and experts alike! Surround yourself with supportive people and stay away from the negative people who can only find faults with you!     If you follow these Tips on How to Get Rid of Belly Fat there is no reason why you won't be able to lose that belly fat! Remember that you can achieve whatever you believe or think in your mind. If you believe you can loose belly fat fast, then you WILL! I know that this sounds very much like The Secret and The Law of Attraction but it is very true!|`|Ii5BojSlaa	JUST DONT EAT  I love foood so much i feel like im gonna die when i cut down, i go to the gym 3 times a week, do my own sport like basketball & rowing, and abdominal workouts at home.... i do eat a treat time to time but i look out on my calories so much that its annoying.  But it is so worth it, i have seen a few improvements around the hips, thighs and my muscles are slowly building up.  Set yourself goals, like big stickers when you walk into the kitchen that say "eat this, you'll die" or something... Can work|`|3vaOIxdHaa	I do the same thing. I plan it but my whole family are poor eaters so there's always snacks around. Maybe you can convince your mom to stop buying them. It hasn't worked for me because she's practically addicted to snacks...but it might work for you.     Well one day. I was bored so I decided to watch a movie. It was so interestiing that i watched the whole movie while walking on a treadmill fluctulating between speeds from 1.0 to 3.0 and I lost a lot of calories. A movie is like an hour and 30 minutes so...  Or you could read, I tried that and almost fell off the treadmill but it might work for you.   You're like me..."there's no time between school and hw" Well homework is like idk an hour or two and you get home at like 3 or 4 pm so you have like a few more hours to exercise. You can walk on a treadmill while watching your favorite hourly shows that come on during the week like House M.D. or Lie To Me* those type of shows that run for an hour that always have new episodes to keep you entertained.   If you don't have a treadmill, try walking around with your friends for hours. My friends hate it, unless it's the mall.  Ice/roller skating ,  bike riding, and swimmming are my personal favorites but I dont swim often. But ice/roller skating and bike riding with friends is fun. Even going alone is okay. On sunday mornings you can bike ride. I live in New England so its to cold to bike ride on sunday mornings anymore.  Staying away from junk food is really hard.  I've been off candy for a long time until yesterday, superbowl sunday, so I'm going to have to break the habit.  It takes about 21 days to break a habit. So just keep marking the days down til those 21 days. If you see the Xs on a calender it reminds you of how well you're doing. so that you wont want to eat the junk food.

It is important that the illnesses or perceived illnesses don't become his identity, or a way of expressing himself.      He needs to be challenged, he needs interests, and need friends.  make sure that he is involved in sports or something physically active that shows that he is truly healthy. If there are medical problems, they will show themselves.      Everyone's health has to be taken seriously, it could be very depressing when someone feel that others don't care.  It's just that if the attention he gets is only sympathy, he will learn that as a way of life.      Plus, when people are physically tired out, like from sports, they tend to sleep a lot better!

TOIOyJ10aa	okay so this is kind of a tricky situation. weed is a softdrug, although many people would think of it as the most horrible thing in the world. its not, it is a softdrug and it NEVER killed anybody. on the other hand alcohol killed thousands of people, you see the hypocrisy??  because of the fact that you wont go hallucinate or jump of a bridge (because some hard drugs like lsd or heroine can throw away all of your boundaries) its important to know what you're doing. i think if you dont believe you're gonna get high, the high will be less big. if you think you're gonna get mind blowingly high you will. if you even believe you're gonna hallucinate, you might will. so, if you are scary this could have a bad effect!  the effect of weed depends on so many things: your gender, what you've eaten before, what state of mind you're in, what kind of other drugs you took, your age, your weight.  but i can tell you right now, you wont die of it.  so, coming back to your questions.    will it be alright for one day, i dont see why not! i have been smoking weed for 3 years everyday now. i can say, that aint good! but i love it. the mental issue for me, is that i only maybe start forget things more easily, i get a sleep a bit harder. the good effects of my smoking overrule those things for me. so i never really had any mental issues. but i did hear people who got paranoia. i believe that if you're smoking it with the feeling that somethings gonna happen, you will get paranoia.  for example: i took mushrooms one time, and i was a little scared of the effect because i didnt know what it was gonna be. well i got paranoia, started thinking everyone was looking at me. until my best friend explained to me this paranoia was caused by myself, and i could stop it immediatly and start enjoying the trip. and so i did!  i dont know if space cake, cause that is the eating version of weed is better for your brain then smoking.  but if i where you, i would smoke it. eating spacecake is tricky. the difference between smoking and eating is that when you smoke it you'll feel the effect only in seconds. if you eat it, it will probably take half an hour. this is dangerous for unexperienced people because you dont know when you had too much! also, if you ate space cake your trip will be longer. if i where you, i would smoke it.  so, dont be affraid! weed is not a drug that will make you crazy. only long term smoking will cause mental issues like me..  i suggest you'll take a good friend with you, go to a place where you feel comfortable, go to a good coffeeshop like greenhouse, dutch flowers, dampkring, rokerij or barneys. (barneys has only english talking personnel) the people who work in the shop will know what to give you, just tell them it's my first time in a long time, so i want a weed that does not have too much THC in it.  another small tip: eat something before you go smoking, that way IF you will get nausia, it wont be that bad.  if you go bad, cause it can happen. eat things with sugar in it. get a coke (not dieet ofcourse) a snickers and chips also helps!  good luck, im sure it'll be allright! smoking doesnt get you hallucinating or tripping, it only makes your nerve system go numb. so dont go driving or working if youre high.  sorry for misspellings, i loved helping out!
yBZlTzWLaa	This is almost certainly a heart monitor. She's likely wearing it to diagnose an arrhythmia, tachycardia, or some other heart problem.    When the box is finished collecting data, it will be analyzed at her hospital, then it will be determined what treatment (if any) will be needed to keep her healthy.    I had to wear a monitor for a week when I was suspected of having Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (quite a mouthful eh?) Fortunately it turns out I was simply dehydrated, and adapting poorly to an unusually hot summer. I am now quite healthy; hopefully your friend's diagnosis will reveal it to be nothing of concern.|`|9vBuOZXxaa	it could be daibetes to a hihger content where they need it to have chords|`|p3NW0Mstaa	My guess is she is monitoring her heart.
x3EPqezJaa	Yes, it's because of the pill. Also, it's not a real period. It's a progesterone withdrawal bleed. In other words, the pill causes your ovaries to mostly shut down, and then the hormones in the pill cause your uterus to mimic a menstrual cycle, but it's not the same as a menstrual cycle. So taking the pill doesn't regulate your period, it takes over the regulation of your body, stopping your body from having periods, then imitating them. In any case, clearly the dosage you were on (on Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo) was wrong for you--it wasn't high enough. The new pill you are on has the same dose of estrogen, but it has more artificial progesterone. Progesterone is what supports the maintenance of your uterine lining, so the extra progesterone will likely mean that you won't have the breakthrough bleeding. It also has iron in it (in the pills that otherwise would be called placebo pills), and that should help you with your possible anemia.

Yes there are certain medication that can help but the only way to overcome the anxiety is to face it, the more you do something then the more you become comfortable with. Getting help is the best thing you can do as they can give you ways to cope with the anxiety and can help with why you are feeling anxious to start with.

They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.    Check out the reference for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.
0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	Sounds like you have done pretty well for a first time jogger. Carry on as you are, run for 5 mins but instead of completely stopping walk for a few minutes. And resume running once you've got some of your breath back. Over time you can gradually decrease the time you spend walking. Take your time.    Also, I don't recommend running every day - start off on 2 or 3 days a week. Seriously your legs will not be able to take it. Also remember to warm up and down properly after each run - this will help prevent muscle aches and stiffness that you will inevitably experience in the beginning.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I'll say your chest really hurt - are you starting with running for 30 minutes?    Not good. Don't run - walk briskly until you don't lose your breath, then start running for say 20 steps, walking for 20, and gradually reduce the number of walking steps until you don't need to walk at all. This will take a couple of months, but your chest won't hurt because you won't be doing more than you are physically capable of doing.     Yes, you burned calories. But just running like that is not good for your heart and lungs. You need to work up to it like I have suggested.|`|oxhClqAWaa	Of course you did! Good job.   The thing is, you're trying to take things too quickly. Start slow, get into the habit of running as you get in better shape. Even if you just go for a brisk walk the whole time, it still burns a lot of calories and gets you in good health.|`|ZchcopClaa	me too lol but u are burning calories and the more u run the easier it gets|`|CqoTqEu6aa	Do you have asthma? perhaps that is why you were so winded?     if not try running at a slower pace, then you will be able to run for a longer period of time before becoming winded - and either way you are burning calorie's! - also the more you run the more you will build up your stamina you will be able to run for longer and longer periods and at a faster pace before becoming tired. just take it a little at a time.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Even tho u sound as if u r slim, u r probably unfit at the mo.

PMR7RovEaa	fiber is good for you. really good for you. you'll know your eating too much of it if you start pooping constantly or your getting diarrhea. fiber will keep you regular and healthy.|`|0ujpiBTCaa	You are getting a lot of fiber, but not actually defecating very often...Once every 2 days is not good. For a young person, eating well and getting plenty of exercise, up to 3 times a day would be ideal.   Where are you getting all this fiber? Supplements? You should aim for 20-30g but it is best to get that from food.    Why are you getting that much protein? Too much of ANYTHING is not good.  If you are using supplements, STOP.

Other than that she shouldn't need to do anything that will require you to have your pants down.  And they usually let you pull up your shorts right after that anyway.    The only danger time for me is when they pull back my foreskin, because sometimes that's enough to trigger a hard on, or at least a semi.|`|oluB6ClPaa	they might just check your height, wieght and other stuffs concerning your physical appearance.|`|iwpwC93maa	An erection possibly?.

She will note the growth of your penis testicle, and pubic hair to see all is going fine as you go through puberty.  Good Luck !!

W4C5p8qOaa	Might you have bacterial vaginosis?|`|WnMrgSg4aa	Did you also get tested for bacterial vaginosis? Sounds like it could be this. Very common and easy to treat, go back to your doc ;)|`|MhpccWpmaa	If you're positive that you don't have a bacterial infection which is the most common cause of odor,  I would suggest trying a product called repHresh.  It's found in the women's care isle and can be bought at CVS.  What it is is a gel insert that you insert into your vagina that maintains a healthy pH in your vagina.  An out of whack pH can cause infections and/or odor.  It's gynocologist reccommended and is safe for long term use.  Each insert lasts 3 days and it doesn't leak out.  So if you have a constant odor problem you can use it every 3 days and this should help to eliminate the odor. And NEVER use a douche, these are terrible for your body and clean out all of the good bacteria as well as the bad causing infections.
fn4ZLN9daa	You didn't mention anything about your diet.  Some people think that if they have fat on their abdomen then doing sit ups will help.  However, the muscles you build up will be under the fat, sit ups won't get rid of the fat.    You have to follow a proper eating plan.  I tried ones that involved calorie counting but they are too hard to stick to.  I follow one that teaches you when to eat etc so that you can still eat food you like in moderation without having to deprive yourself.    With regard to the pills I've never taken them so I can't comment on that.|`|fmDEqjRKaa	there's a milkshake diet that if you go on it doesn't taste nice but it gives u 2500 calories a day and loses wait quickly my mum lost 2 stone in a month|`|JYHlPczxaa	Easy (and Sexy) Ways to Lose 50 Pounds a Year      Exercise for 15-20 minutes. If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.|`|ZchcopClaa	i got some metabo off ebay and they really do work|`|yDadok18aa	There are many ways to lose weight, but I think what you are doing might be a bit too much.

8SRjELNBaa	If you are as determined & self-disciplined as you sound, i definitely believe you can do that.     Over time as you become more strict with your diet you'll begin to notice it takes less calories and more water to keep you feeling full.  The pounds will literally be shedding off you.     For example, im finding it only takes ~250 calories per meal to keep me full to the next meal, no snacks, & I'm still eating my vegetables at dinner.    Best of luck for your trip!|`|hY0cb2xRaa	Absolutely !! Since you are cutting calories, when you feel hungry eat fruits and veggies .. and also add 2-3 servings of milk and 6-8 cups of water. Do not starve yourself. eat whenever you feel hungry.. If you starve yourself then your body will go in starvation mode and you will not loose weight anymore.. So don't hestitate to eat. All the best !!!|`|BVIPL2Tiaa	how many pounds would you like to loose in general? but if you keep up this diet than you can loose up to 90 lbs. so yes, i think this goal is very efficient, and good luck(:|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Sure, you may have to change your exercise around a little because our bodies get used to things after awhile. If you are eating at least 1200-1500 calories and not doing something like cutting that amount by 500, it sounds like a reasonable plan.

dFE54Nzraa	Unless you are tall (5'7" +) 115 lbs isn't much, but I'm assuming you are shorter.    In that short time, all you can really do is watch your diet. Little things like changing your milk from whole to skim, regular soda to diet, drinking more water, eating brown rice instead of white, eating good during the day so you don't end up starving at night, etc...    As far as 'toning' up, there is no such thing as 'toning up.' The less body fat you have, the more muscle you'll be able to see, that's why I focused on the diet part. You can start doing squats, leg presses, and leg extensions to build your thigh muscles, but they will never get you 'toned.'     Summary: Diet and Cardio.    Good Luck|`|Pn8SATLuaa	diet and exercise|`|kDv1uC1raa	Drink a lot of water... its physiologically the only way to remove fat from a cell and I lost lots of weight and toned up by drinking 7-8 glasses a day and cleaning/rearranging my house kept me busy without getting bored... turn on some music and your getting stuff done and losing weight...|`|OTFzJbaMaa	take up latin and ballroom dancing. its one of the best full body work outs anyone can do.   leg lifts and floor exercises also helps.       trust me i lost overrr 60 pounds.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Get out there and walk, on your neighborhood streets, in daytime, after school.  Go walk 20-30 minutes a day.  When you come back, don't eat a lot, eat small meal.  Do not eat between meals, eat three good meals, do not skip breakfast.  Breakfast is your most important meal, for the brain.  For real, breakfast is the most important meal and it is good for the brain.  Eat fruit every day.   But between exercise, daily, and cutting back on food you will loose, in approx 1-2 weeks you will see results begin.  This is a regular exercise for life to walk daily.|`|VVF6DJVzaa	Do not starve yourself. But a good tip is to drink water before you eat a meal. Like 2 cups of water, then go eat dinner until you full. At the dinner table your moms gonna get pissed, and your dads gonna turn compasionate. GIRL EAT YOUR DAMN DINNER. GOD WHY CANT YOU EAT. and ur dads gonna go aww its okay dont try and get skinnier your alreayd pretty blah blah...    Another good tip...DO NOT BE BORED. i dont care what you do u can go and touch yourself. because boredom means fat people. Once your bored u can't seem to find anything cause ur life sucks so much, u look for food. then you eat it usually snack kind of foods. I mean if  you have so much fun with your friends that require you to be active you won't feel hungry. Once I played basketball for 6 hrs with my friends. Didn't feel hungry untill like 30 mins after i stopped. Idk what it was like my body went into like survival mode or something.     Like i mean you can go eat at Mcdonalds, but just try and find ways to cut down without your brain and stomach fight you for another bite.     And to the bigget way to lose fat, its called running ya lazy girls. So you have to do cardio workouts. No lifting or sprinting. Don't want to get buff and nasty. But basically its just you gotta do a sport or something. I mean swimming is okay, but u get buff shoulders.     One thing i forgot is when girls without good genetics get really skinny they unfortunately have little or no chest...Cause i mean what is a girls chest made of? its def not all muscle. So if you diet a lot expect your chest size to decrease some. Same with running. So still good to have some fat on ya.|`|al0cCPb6aa	Eat more protien and less carbs...protien actually helps eat away some of that fat...but if you're eating lots of carbs it definitely counter acts that.

Try and cut fast food out of your diet and try to eat small meals all throughout the day. My trainer says to eat at least 6 meals a day that are well balanced with protein, greens, and fat.     I do TurboJam and love it!!! Running is the fastest fix though.

xgYU9uo7aa	Search: ringworm turmeric    I haven't tried turmeric for ringworm, but it worked on a growth on my forehead that was like a pimple, except there was no pus, and it was like half fingernail, half skin. If it was my ringworm, I'd still use the anti-fungal cream from the drugstore, and alternate with the turmeric.     A lot of those sites I skimmed mentioned mixing the turmeric with coconut oil. If you don't have any, I'm thinking generic or commercial over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment would be a suitable replacement.    If you use makeup to cover it up for prom night, be use q-tips to apply the makeup, and then throw away the q-tip once it's touched your skin, and get a new q-tip if you need more makeup. Otherwise you'll contaminate your makeup, and could cause ringworm outbreaks on your face later.    Good luck!
Vt6X62ovaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se to lose weight, the only method which really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it was featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

MhpccWpmaa	Burning and pain can be signs that you still have a yeast infection.  Every time I've had one I've experienced burning during sex.  I would say that it's probably because you did it so soon after taking the medicine.  The best way to do it is to wait about a week after you take the medicine to make sure that it's completley gone.  It's very likely that you reinfected yourself by having sex and may have to do another treatment|`|X58gVB7Eaa	You shouldn't have sex untill a few days after all of the symptoms of your yeast infection are gone. Monistat 3 has to be taken for 3 days meaning the yeast infection could be still there. Yeast infections can be passed from you to your sex partner (guys can get it too!!) Having sex while having a yeast infection can cause lots of burning and quite a painful experience. Its normal.
b8QAG31laa	put down the cake|`|g6Vci5SUaa	A few questions first.      One, what are your health concerns?  Are you diagnosed with anything in particular or are you worried about your weight affecting your health in the future?      Two, at age 16, how much control do you have over your diet?  Meaning do you have any influence at all over what food comes into your home?

Would you actually like to take part in sports day without feeling self concious? Maybe use the health concerns as your kick-start? Its impossible to lose weight just because you want to, you need a bigger reason.    Next, make life as hard for yourself as possible. I mean walk to school if you dont, go up the stairs not the escalator, don't sit down when you could walk the dog or do the ironing for your mum or something.    NEVER starve yourself. It will give you even worse health concerns. Instead, eat slower (a Paul McKenna tip), put less food on your plate, eat your vegetables first.    Identify your main overeating problems. Do you eat because youre sad? Excersise releases happy hormones like chocolate does but without the sense of guilt!    Drink loads of water. I find that i'm not actually hungry when I think I am, Im just thirsty. Itll also stop you drinking fatty/ sugary things.     Every ounce you lose is a step to becoming a healthier you. Its cheesy but don't devalue any small amount of weight you lose, everything is good when you have health concerns.    Good luck, go at a steady pace and focus on feeling good rather than a dramatic change. Its more likely to work long term that way.
dFE54Nzraa	Because it can also expand, the logical answer would be: yes, it can shrink.|`|hCSuAhfjaa	Yes, you can shrink your stomach, but it can stretch back out again.  Gradually eating smaller amounts worked for me and then when you have reached the point you desire, stay with that amount of food.  If you are hungry between meals, eat nutritious foods in reasonable amounts and don't wait until you can eat a whole cow to satisfy your hunger!|`|AA11203146	Yes! yes! yes!  just like a rubberband (well maybe that isn't such a good analogy) the stomach can stretch, and can also go back to a smaller size after being stretched.    Ways to do this:  most obviously watch your proportions, and don't over eat! that is what causes the stretching in the first place!  It takes our brain 20 min to know we are full, so we tend to eat more than our stomachs can hold without doing a little stretching.  also, try keeping your stomach sucked in for most of the day, this works your abs like a girdle, and the more often you do so the more your stomach naturally pulls in and is kept in check by your muscles.    of course, just wanting your stomach to shrink through dieting is a little silly, you HAVE TO get exercise in, just having your stomach shrink won't eliminate the fat on your belly. even if having a smaller stomach might help you eat less, it can't make up for all the benefits you get from exercise like clearer skin, improved heart and lung health.. etc
2R1H8B8taa	I think you will get very bored with this workout quickly. It sounds good, but you do need some variety.     Healthy weightloss tips:    1. Eat veggies  2. Have water with you where you go. You can put lemon or lime in it to give it a little zing.  3. Cut out soda (yes, even diet sodas. They stimulate your appetite)  4. Cut out white processed sugars.  5. Don't try supplements. I know someone else mentioned the acai berry. Yes, these things are natural, but can give many side effects. Over the counter diet supplements often have caffeine in them and are not regulated by the FDA. So, basically, anyone can put anything in there.    For walking workouts (that will give you some variety) just google it. There is quite a few different types.    I also have the wii fit, and its pretty fun and gives a good workout. I am an avid exerciser (ask my husband, i work out at least 2 hrs per day) and it gives a good workout on days when you don't want to go out!|`|duyN8ahBaa	There are Tree way to lose weight basically  1] control dieting  2] work out regular basis   3] take Doctors Advice & Pills  if you can do 2/3 of these at a time, its so effictive.

Just make sure that you are drinking 8 + cups of water a day.|`|d3d94b7461a0d0776423a6eeaa2b2d01aa	No, it does not sound good.  Get specific about what your going to do.  What type of exercises you will be performing, the weight you will be using, how man reps you will be doing.  What type of walking are you going to do... slow walking or fast walking trying to get a target heart rate??  What sugars that you eat will you cut out? what carbs are you not going to eat?  what type of meals plans do you have?  Do you have a food journal?      You need to get specific and stick with a plan that has goals or your going to have bad results.  Sorry to sound negative, I'm just trying to give you some ideas.  Good luck
f8mLpPXlaa	Just guessing but it sounds like  a cold coming on.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Sounds like the crappy flu that is going around that makes you cough and can go into bronchitis. Start taking meds like Dayquil, etc. right away, lots of fluids, rest as much as possible. Also if you have Ester-C, start taking it, and multivitamins. Wash your hands a lot too.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Could be sinus, a cold or something similar.|`|I8szWmVMaa	Sounds like the common cold. Tomorrow will probably be the worst (or tonight).

jbTSXd5oaa	scream, yell, cough, drink acid..    And the number one way to give yourself a massive sore throat is  make dahl.    Instructions:    Follow the recipe exactly until you get to the cayenne pepper. Try to add it as normal, then realise the pepper is stuck to the sides of its container. Turn container upside down over food and smack. Watch gobs of pepper fall into food. Wonder idly if that is more or less than you intended to add. Figure that it doesnt matter because youre making a double batch anyway. Continue to cook dahl. When dahl is done, eat it rapidly with only a little rice because rice is not something you enjoy. Realize about half-way through your bowl that, probably, you added more pepper than you meant to. Continue to eat because you are hungry. Eat until your sinuses drain and your nose runs. About that time, you will develop a bad sore throat as well.|`|55ht6KX3aa	Be honest and tell the choir director you don't want the solo. Or quit choir.

MhpccWpmaa	It would probably be ok but I still wouldn't just because I don't like the idea of douching in general.  There is a product call repHresh that you can buy at CVS.  They're gel inserts that you put in your vagina after your period, before/after intercourse, or just anytime you want to feel fresh.  They don't leak out and they last for 3 days each.  They're also gynocologist reccommended and are safe for long term use

You need to drink lots of WATER, NOT gatorade or other drinks.     gatorade is meant to replenish electrolytes, which are lost after exercising rigorously. Drinking gatorade at just a normal time will make you dehydrated because they contain high levels of sodium.     You should be drinking about a gallon of water a day (I know, it seems like a lot)|`|AA10651366	drink water!!!
bIo5c6NKaa	Simple.   1. Drop the whey protein. Diet fads like that just make you gain weight.  2. The workouts your doing are anarobic. They give less results in the long run.  3. You need to start doing aerobic activity. Do 30 minutes of cardio a day, and keep increeasing that by 5 min. Do pilates to tone up muscle you have.   4. Often you gain muscle when you lift weights, and muscle weighs more than fat. So you could be thinner, but the result doesn't show on the scale.   5. Drink lots of water. If you don't your body retains water, which makes you weigh more.|`|PHY2vd6baa	stop drinking the whey...and do more cardio work outs.....instead of muscle building....|`|AA11117029	weight loss takes time, continue working out and eating healthy, and you will see results.

I wish you the best.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Very simple. If calories in (eating) is greater than Calories out (exercise)  Then you will gain weight. If calories out exceeds calories in, then you'll lose weight. Very simple math.

Dm9ouXV9aa	Yes, I think so...the thing is, will those small meals hold you over until you can eat again? Like pita bread with cheese, while it is very healthy, might not keep you satisfied for another 2 hours and 20mins. I also think you should add more veggies in there somewhere...and I would try not to eat after six, because once you go to sleep, you are not digesting food anymore, so all the food you ate for dinner will stay there until morning. You should give yourself more food choices and have more to eat for each meal.

So she is definitely screaming for attention.|`|4M9wOmKwaa	I would suppose that people really hate it when they are accused of wanting attention. But since she isn't your friend, it doesn't really matter to me. My friend pretty much did the same thing except her parents were getting divorced. I think the girl just wants people to feel bad for her and wants them to comfort her even though they don't have a good relationship. To feel like other people care makes her feel better. But, somebody will probably tell a guidance counselor which is what happened to my friend and it won't be that much fun.|`|3ljf1xLlaa	Tell her it is not safe to do that in public in this society because there are a lot of snitches.|`|giyLM0VOaa	thats how i was...  not the emo part...  she jjust wants people to know how her life is.. thats all...|`|175XmxsPaa	I think its a cry for help. She wants anyone to just take her in and help her.|`|CRPesW63aa	Ok, I'm going to sound angry for a moment, but it's totally not personal.    If a two year old screams for attention, we call it a fit. If an adult does it, we call it screaming for attention.... If a diabetic starts siezuring because of low blood sugar, no one says they are crying for attention...    Point being, Something is TERRIBLY wrong, no matter how annoying it seems that this person is crying out for help in this way, they need serious help. There is something wrong in the brain when the human being decides that death is the solution. Face it, it goes against our programing to volunteer for death, to encourage it, and to bring it upon ourselves.    I know... they didn't really try to kill themselves that bad if they are still alive, but the fact is... She could have easily screwed up and finished the job, and you'll never know if it was an accident that she didn't die.  Just because someone fires the gun and only grazes their sckull, does that make the act less insane?  She needs help, she IS screaming for attention, and hopefully someone steps in before she screams to death.|`|zAi5Xl1Laa	Yes, she is screaming for attention but she needs help.  Take her seriously, please.  She needs intervention by an adult.  Tell a teacher, a school counselor or any other person you trust.  Cutting is a VERY serious thing that can lead to serious injury or even death.|`|Q2MTQxZoaa	shes begging for attention. i know plenty of people who have done that and crazier things for attention. dont buy into her story. she needs a doctor but not attention from other people at school, thatll only feed it and make her worse

GXiCrhVYaa	I have been using apple cider vinegar (ACV) for about 6 months now. I almost always see Bragg's ACV from a health food store recommended as the very best to use---much better than anything you will find in a grocery store.    Without going into detail, ACV (taken orally) cured my gastritis, and applied on the skin it cured a wart I had for over a year.    The link below will give you loads of info about moles. I think someone made a comment on checking with an MD first if the mole is changing---before doing the ACV.     Briefly, the steps are (1) to slightly pierce the mole with a toothpick or small needle. (2) Take the cotton off a Q tip and dip it into ACV. (3) Insert some of the ACV from the Q tip into the mole. (4) Apply ACV on the outside of the mole. (5) Add a bandaid wet with ACV over the mole and leave overnight. Repeat as needed.     You will see references to cotton soaked in ACV and then held in place with duct tape. I found masking tape to do a good job even on hairy parts (like my legs). So I suggest that over duct tape.      All my best. Check out this link. People have slightly different approaches.    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/moles.h...    PS Learn from my mistakes. No matter how curious you are, avoid picking at the mole after removing the bandaid. That will only prolong the healing process.|`|JEXiKUmGaa	I am not sure about apple cider or vinegar, but I do know from personal use that Dermatend does work. It is a natural method, which it seems that's what you are looking for.     I have removed several moles from my body, and one in a matter of 5 days, not only that it comes with a 100% guarantee. I recommend it for removing moles at home.

Bacterial infections are caused by different bacteria and there are specific antibiotics that are effective for specific bacteria.      For instance Amoxicillin is not a good antibiotic for urinary tract infections.

As you begin to see the goodness of your own action in the responses of others you will begin to feel better about yourself and there is your self confidence.

cF236fvTaa	um yea its what you can do with it.|`|hVY2AWEbaa	thats perfectly fine. 5-6 inch is the average . i find that guy with big penises puts less effort in to sex . because they just "show up" and men with small or average penis actually put more effort into making us feel good .|`|QKGuNLb4aa	its in the normal range|`|AA11447210	You can easily look up average penis size online yourself. However it doesn't matter if it's a decent size if you don't know how to use it. Learn to wield it well, or it's not useful for anything other than to pee out of.

Problem with this diet is it can cause cold, sneezes and also cough.  I think you should make it as whole the day depend on juices that to without adding sugar but at the supper time take diet with high in proteins and fiber like pulka and with soya, rajma and other whole grams. Should concentrate on less carbohydrated foods and no oil, no sugar|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	You shouldn't just stick with fruit, you need other types of nutrients and vitamins that won't come from fruits alone.   Just eat as you normally would but in smaller portions and exercise often.
AFBy5aozaa	enamel pearls are an excess of growth of the enamel. it usually forms down under the crown, on the root surface. they are not too common, but nothing to be alarmed about, unless it is causing you pain or causing damage to the surrounding gingiva. there is little, to none cultural significance.
jWlZG1J6aa	It depends on the girl honey. Some want smaller slimer penises and some want thicker longer penises. I'm a female who just wants something average b/c I do not like pain during intercourse. I've been with bigger guys and although I did enjoy it, it did hurt sometimes. My husband is just an average joe and I enjoy every bit of him. So like I said it just depends on the girl bc penis size is not all. Hell he can be big and not know what to do with it. Or smaller and can freak the hell out of her and get her to cook breakfast and deliver lunch to him everyday. Hope that helps.|`|xoR3aRiAaa	NO, the uterus is still normal is size|`|P1bO87l1aa	height makes no difference and its not the size of the penis, Its how it is used.  There are no nerve endings after about the first two inches of the vagina so going deep really has no bearing on pleasure.  Its all in the first couple inches|`|v9cORzzfaa	Its not how big it is... it's how you use it. Women wouldn't like it if we chose them for their cup size... so they shouldn't pick us for our penis size.    And if the girl has had kids, she isn't exactly going to be... like "new" down there. It's not going to be as tight as it used to be, so an above average penis may not feel as good as it did before she had children. It's not the guys fault.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Yes, she needs a real man|`|AA11447210	Her height has no bearing on what length penis she finds pleasing.

Just because you are tall has nothing to do with the need to have a bigger penis.  Do you think you have a larger vagina.  Your legs are longer an maybe your body is longer but I doubt your vagina is just as normal as a 5' tall person.  Some woulb be unhappy with that it just depends on the woman and her preference.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Their vaginas aren't bigger just because their tall.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	depends on how he uses it.

kK4GG6Z2aa	There are many reasons why this waver is used.  One reason is if a child is adopted from another country..tuberculosis is becoming more prevalent as immigration increases.  So if the family are immigrants this is why they would need to sign a waver. If you search the web by just writing tuberculosis waver you will find loads more information.  This is law in the US though not sure if it applies to any other country.  Good luck and I'm sure you have nothing to be worried about..Hope this helps
QKGuNLb4aa	no you dont have to take it at the exact same time every day just within an hour or so|`|P1bO87l1aa	Basically what they mean by the same time each day is if you start taking it it the morning with breakfast take it everyday ion the morning.  Not morning one day evening the next noon the next.  Just sit within a few hours.|`|AA11447210	As close to the same time as possible, but at least in general in the morning or at lunch time or right after supper. It doesn't have to be taken at the same exact time on the clock each day.    When I took the pill, years ago, I took it when I got up in the morning (whenever that was...generally no more range than a hour or so) and it never failed me. Now I'm on the injection and don't have to worry about it.|`|uxq33y1maa	You have a few hours, actually. About 2-3. But I always try to take mine within the hour to stay in the habit. Good luck!|`|Rx0ae0suaa	Just within the same hour - pretty much, as close to the time you've chosen.|`|IMBxuko3aa	If you're on combined pill its a 2 hour period and if you're on a progestin only pill you should really try to take it at the same exact time .
T3cGj2bHaa	If you're interested in diet pills, you need to check out this site to find out which one is right for you: http://www.criticalorie.com/    It's an amazing site, it's going to tell you which ones work and which ones don't, and exactly why or why not. It'll have all the information you need to make a good choice.    Good luck!|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|sUmlxkQlaa	Your best bet is just taking something with caffeine and other stuff to give you energy so you can exercise more.  It also keeps your blood pumping.  Like drinking lots of coffee.  Prescription pills are dangerous and their side effects are worse than steroids.    Remember, whatever you take, they don't do it for you.  You can't take a pill that will motivate you to eat better or exercise more.     Personally, I get up in the morning and take a multivitamin, fish oil, and stacker 3 (for energy without calories of a red bull).|`|386524142680a3e18e5b2498e17e6041aa	If you will read the labels,most will say to use the pills with a reduced calorie intake. If you do that,reduce calories you will lose weight,but the pill will get the credit!
K7x1RHVFaa	Sounds like you are otherwise preoccupied or in a negative mood and you are transferring your displeasure onto things you would otherwise treat differently. Try meditating from time to time to clear your mind when you feel you are not acting as you ought.    Good Luck.
bFZBIVWNaa	It's just a phase.  I went through that too.  Just try to consciously relax about it.  I know it's hard.  What's important is that you realize that you're over-reacting, and try to get back to your normal state.  Maybe there's a lot of stress in your life or you're not sleeping well?  This is normally a symptom of stress.
fxxARcknaa	it should be fine.|`|iDVJi9alaa	Yes. Percodan is Oxycodone with aspirin. Why they put tylenol in the stuff is beyond me.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Oxycodone can be mixed with bayer with no problem. If you have inflammatory pain you could probably get good relief just with the aspirin.|`|fudPrZTyaa	Why don't you call her back and ask this question? Just to make sure.|`|yJBHDdSuaa	why would you want to mix?  Call you doctor back and ask them.  If they just saw you , they should be able to tell you what to take.  Be careful what you mix with meds.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	There is no problem with doing it,,, I take oxycotin and baby aspirin every day
AA11334101	Is there any spots or blisters? You didn't explain the rash enough (does it itch, how long has it been there?) Maybe you are allergic to the underwear material or laundry soap or softener, or even soap that you shower with. Rashes are caused by inflamation of the skin, allergic reaction, irritations or even from a virus or staph infections. It's hard to say without seeing it, so throw some hydrocortizone cream on in and make an appointment to see your DR. Good luck
mpGjPV6Xaa	Ok, well first of all you should eat at least 3 - 4 meals a day that contain plenty of calories and protein. Also, get 8 hours of sleep, because you only gain weight/muscle when you sleep good. Drink 6 - 8 glasses of water a day 8 oz glass each time. Go to the gym, and exercise, because you don't just want to put on body fat, you want to trim it down at the same time.     So, now 8 hours of sleep, 8 glasses of water ( 8 oz ) , consume plenty of calories depending on your weight , but you need at least " 1400 - 2000 calories a day. You should tell me your weight so I can tell you exactly how many calories you need to consume a day.     Plus, you may have a fast metabolism which is why you're not gaining like you want to. It could be your genetics, you just might take after somebody in your family that is built the same way.    But, just do the things I listed and you should gain some weight regardless. You can also order or buy weight gainers that you take with a meal, which increases the speed of gaining weight. You can find weight gainer products on this website called All the whey.    Hope I helped, and good luck with your weight !!!!|`|su37vnIXaa	you should build muscle.  Dont just pig out...thats unhealthy. start weight lifting & if you really wanna gain weight fast eat late at night|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	eat lots of ice cream|`|LoO9LptJaa	maybe you could talk to your doctor about what could   work to put you at a healthy weight =] lack of excercise +  over-eating are definitely not healthy ways to gain weight!  goodluck with everything =] ?|`|gWMBy2HMaa	eat a lot of snacks all day long and watch movies or you might have a tape worm no mater how much you eat you don't gain weight or make your own shirts & pants|`|08MX9wL2aa	cork your rear for about a week. that should work.|`|K5u5Frzraa	make sure you are taking in more calories then you are burning.   besides this lift weights, but still eat healthy.|`|ROQE2pDUaa	im underweight and i go to the gym...it already started working...instead of getting fat and eating to gain weight i am adding muscle to my body...yeah!!!|`|6S7CgcQoaa	just dont eat at for a few days and them pig out and youlll gain alot|`|aPyixcKOaa	Go to a nutritionist :) also, Cliff bars on a daily basis could help.     eating more wont really do much good. working out is good because it helps you gain weight, but not from fat!!!|`|hsKFt4auaa	aww!  I used to have this problem when I was in high school.  No boys liked me and they all thought I was awkward and skinny.  It made me have ZERO self esteem.  The best thing to do is not to worry too much about how you look  - even though that is very hard and you do not want to hear that.  I didnt gain weight until I went to college, but I know exactly the culprit.  ICE CREAM.  I ate it by the gallons.  Not to gain weight, but because I had never had so much access to Ben and Jerrys before.  Now I wish that I could find the simple solution of how to lose weight.  If you want to gain weight, then after all of your healthy meals, be sure to eat some ice cream.  You will gain quickly.|`|CMeh1vR7aa	ok when you go shopping for food look at the back  of everything  and look at the fats and sugar and the things that have alot of those things  especially calories that is the best thing to get and dont drink milk or juice drink soda like Mountaio Dew those things have alot of augar in them and drink it every time u eat and when you get thirsty and be lazy eat junk food eat potarts and have alot of things and probally you will gain weight|`|ENtaLmvbaa	(anorexic*)  if you truly just want to gain weight, keep your activity level to a minimum and eat more.  the human body is quite simple in that respect =)  but in all honesty, that isn't healthy because it'll just be fat gain.  but what you should do is work to increase your muscle mass.  do strength training and weight lifting.  building up and toning your muscles (and exercising, period) will not only make you much more healthy all around, but you'll notice that someone who is skinny but also fit and muscular - it just looks more natural and not as "god, look how skinny she is", you know?  and please make sure that you eat enough and eat right!|`|BtFmlcHcaa	A good way to gain weight is to eat just before you go to bead, still healthy, but if you eat before you sleep, you will be taking in calories and not using them, thus gaining weight.

Just drink plenty of water, take some rest and avoid places where the bug is going around.|`|OR5PhU40aa	I'm like you. I can't stand vomiting -- whether it's me, someone else, and watching it on TV or reading about it disturbs me. It's almost like a phobia, and there's not much you can do, other than avoid people with the stomach flu and make sure the food you eat is totally safe.    I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I haven't thrown up since I was five. That's ten years. XD|`|WjSJBWl7aa	See that ham that you bought three weeks ago? Throw it out.

3vxxhEjcaa	Aww. That's not healthy now is it, sweetie?    You can lose a few pounds in about a week but not 10. Just buy a dress that seems more flowy. And pick a darker color, it's better.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If you do manage to some how lose 10 pounds in a week, you will sitll not be able to fit into the clothes if thats what your trying to do.    The weight will be water and muscle, meaning your fat will actually come out more, making you bigger.

EFYxcWNyaa	If you have used all this and you are fell like nothing is there then your gums might have been hurt because of a piece of sharp taco. rinse it with some warm water and give it a little time to heal. don't use the toothpicks because you might hurt yourself more. if you were experiencing pain in next couple of days see a dentist to have it checked out.
AA10358331	Lol.. Your friends are lying when they say its easy to get one, because for girls it isn't.   Normally if you have to ask if you've had one then you haven't. An orgasm kinda feels like a rush of endorphins and you are just washed over with happiness :)    If you haven't tried a vibrator yet i would suggest investing in one. Especially a rabbit vibrator if you can afford one.   Or what always worked for me was using the bath tub faucet. Just let the warm water just pound on your clit. it might help. Relax and don't try to force one to come, it will come by its self. Try watching porn or reading an erotic book, thinking sexual thoughts.|`|QKGuNLb4aa	there are people who just cant orgasm but it is very very rare. you just need to relax. if you are tense it makes it harder to reach orgasm. and then just do what feels good. you will know when you orgasm. everyone is different but for me when i do all my muscles tense and then relax really fast.|`|PNLwOIOraa	I did this earlier lol actually. Cup your hand over your vagina and start moving your hand in a circular motion. That doesnt sound exactly what i did..... go hump a pillow or use a shower head!|`|eal4vU6Taa	sit on top of the dryer and relax (while it is going)  it works for me|`|0HBXtFo7aa	Vibrator hun. Best thing you will def have one then
AA11248450	I will never forget the first day i got them on. I did not sleep at all that night. I was tossing and turning. It was torture. You are not going to be able to prevent the pain but taking some tylenol might help. It didnt work for me. After the first day or so its not as bad. In the long run you will be better off so don't worry. Im very happy i got braces. The procedure is that the dentist will cement small brackets to each of your teeth then run a wire through them and put rubber o-rings to keep the wire in place. You might also have to get rubber bands that tie your upper and lower teeth in order to realign your jaw. Those hurt too. Also your going to have to go in every 3 weeks to get your rubber o-rings replaced and the wire changed out. Good Luck.|`|UYDAOJxcaa	Not really, you are more annoyed than in pain. They will have this thing to keep you tongue out of the way, and these big things that keep your mouth wide open. You can't really feel what they are doing, all you can tell is, something on your tooth, a little push, then the next tooth.         Wires on the other hand, they will hurt a little bit, they will cut the wire, but if it still is too long and is poking you, make sure to tell them! If you don't, you will have a small cut for about a month!        For ways to prevent hurting, if you really need to, bring a little teddy bear! It takes FOREVER  to get them on!            Color combos, I go with the holiday that month! For Easter, do something like pink,blue,yellow , just remember not to do more than 4 colors, or the people will get annoyed!|`|6t76bgS3aa	they put the metal on your teeth which hurts and then they put on the wires which also hurts.  your teeth will be sore for like a week.  then every month or so they tighten the wires, that hurts too.  i like white for the color because it's the most natural, in fact they even make white braces, those are the best, but i think they're more expensive.  i had braces when i was a teenager, and i'm glad my parents made me do it.  i wouldn't be too sexy with crooked spaced out teeth.|`|JWa78QVoaa	no real pain, it's uncomfortable though|`|1nINGDC7aa	Fixing of braces by dentist does not hurt itself as the brackets on teeth are just glued. There are not shots and drilling involved. However after the dentist put wire in them and this wire starts putting pressure on teeth to move and this will create pain for you. However you can take pain killer tablet for that. Moreover this pain goes away in 7-10 days.     There are many colors. The brackets are always metallic but the bands on them are colored like red, yellow, green, blue, silver and transparent. For more information on braces you can read the following very informative article on this...... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|6r8fuiMQaa	Braces don't hurt when you get them on. But it gets uncomfortable. I would have some advil or tylenol afterwards.  Cute combos? Well some people choose colors for upcoming holidays.  Maybe green and pink  or red and pink|`|gjeOKI52aa	Yes they do hurt depending upon how many you get on but it's not like a sharp pain hurt. It's more just being sore. Take some tylenol or something and you'll be fine. As for cute color combos... erm... o.O Right...|`|ROQE2pDUaa	when i got braces it didnt hurt getting them on...but an hour or two later it started hurting...but i just took some painkillers and was fine...just eat soft foods and chew from the back back farthest back...soup....rice....i got purple and lime green for my first time and it was cute...bright at first but then it got a little dull and cute...it takes an hour process...ur teeth will hurt for about a week or two....then in later appointments itll hurt for about a week cuz ull get used to them.....it still hurts for me when i get them tightend...only 1 and 1/2 more years to go...it also depends on what kind of braces ur getting of cours....i think u can only get colors on metal braces not on clear brackets...good luck...|`|cCxK6MKQaa	Putting them on will not hurt, all they do is put a little adhesive on you're tooth and with tweezer looking things set the brace on the tooth and it sticks on. Once they put the wires on and tighten the braces up you're teeth will hurt about 30 minutes after from them starting to move, you will find it annoying to eat when first tightened but the next day you're teeth will feel normal again. Its really nothing to worry about with the pain|`|1MAly4aiaa	they will clean and dry your teeth. then cement little square pieces of metal to your teeth, then put a wire through the metal. then  rubber bands around the metal.    no - it does NOT hurt getting them on. you will be uncomfortable with your mouth wide open and dry for so long though.  once you leave with your braces, they will be extra soar. so try to take something like ibuprofen before they hurt. eat mushy or soup foods.  that will help ease pain when eating. they will cut into your cheeks, as you sleep and talk. ask your dentist for wax- you put a little on each brace and it prevents the cutting. you do develop almost calluses and the skin will get strong inside your cheeks and they wont get cut anymore.     braces don't hurt, they are just sore and uncomfortable. there will be no sharp pain, or anything that you should worry about.|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	The first step is to determine if braces are suitable for the patient. The doctor consults with the patient and inspects the teeth visually. If braces are appropriate, a records appointment is set up where X-rays, molds, and impressions are made. These records are analyzed to determine the problems and proper course of action. Typical treatment times vary from six months to two and a half years depending on the complexity and types of problems. Orthognathic surgery may be required in extreme cases.    Teeth to be braced will have an applied to help the cement bond to the surface of the tooth. In most cases the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the molars to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when dental fillings or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible.    An archwire will be threaded between the brackets and affixed with elastic or metal ligatures. Elastics are available in a wide variety of colors. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results. Brackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the archwire to affix the elastic to. The placement and configuration of the elastics will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Elastics are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths.    Modern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth.       Dental braces, with a transparent powerchain, removed after completion of treatment.In many cases there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion: the palate or arch is made larger by using a palatal expander. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to unfuse them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery, but to expand the dental arch, and not the palate.    For some patients, Invisalign are a viable alternative to traditional braces. The Invisalign system uses a series of clear plastic trays to move teeth into their position over a length of time. While conventional braces are fixed to the patient's teeth, and are therefor always working, Invisalign trays are removable. Removing the trays results in a longer treatment time. The system is not recommended for more difficult cases, or for people whose last molars have yet to erupt.    Each month or two, the braces must be adjusted. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted the orthodontist takes off the colored rubber bands keeping the wire in place. The wire is then taken out, and may be replaced or modified. When the wire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a color for the new rubber bands, which are then fixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort, which is normal.
E64juLwJaa	Men can grow till their early twenties:i grew 3 inches at age 23.  And it is an old wives tale that you will not grow anymore as soon you have a full beard:nonsense.  Planets|`|0JERmAslaa	no might grow a little but im not thinking more than half an inch|`|68r4mmOnaa	You are actaully at the peak. It mainly depends at what age you got your growth spurts. They usually range 5 years. So if you stopped at 18. You probably got grrowthspurts when 13. Having a beard does not matter, neither does your background. It is all genetics.

The best way to know is this - if you take them for several weeks and it gets worse, and then you stop them for several weeks and it goes away, its the most likely culprit.    I say several weeks because it takes that long to be incorporated in your cellular membranes, and thus effect your body functions.

"On April 8, 2003, at age 72, Dr. Atkins slipped on the ice while walking to work, hitting his head and causing bleeding around his brain. He lost consciousness on the way to the hospital, where he spent two weeks in intensive care. His body deteriorated rapidly and he suffered massive organ failure. During this time, his body apparently retained an enormous amount of fluid, and his weight at death was recorded at 258 pounds. His death certificate states that the cause of death was "blunt impact injury of head with epidural hematoma". "    I'm 40 and I follow a paleo-diet which is VERY similar to the Atkins Diet. I've lost 100 lbs and am cured of depression, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, GERD & acne- and my cholesterol and lipid profile are phenomenal.
R9KvEhMxaa	Phenoxyethanol is rather safe. The problem with mommy's bliss is that they used rather large amounts of it, in combination with another substance, Chlorphenesin which can have much stronger effects. And it was placed in a nipple cream, in such a situation, a breast feeding infant would be ingesting large quantities of it. Basically overdosing the infant.    The amount in a vaccine, by comparison, is too small to have any sort of physiological impact on a human, probably even an infant mouse.    Phenoxyethanol is not a banned substance at all.|`|266XxMZ8aa	vaccines actually consist of small doses for viral infections. its so your body can bulid up an immunity to it. for example, the flu shot actually has 3 different types of the influenza virus in it. that is injected into someone and they become immune to it.|`|2SxBqNd2aa	Vaccines are much safer now than at the time between 1985 and 2001. The FDA never recognized that Thimerosal, a mercury based preservative added to childhood vaccines that were dispensed in bulk (basically all at that time to save money), was responsible for the high occurrence in autism for babies/toddlers. However, they did order the Pharm. to stop manufacturing the vaccines with this chemical, but they did not recall the existing, contaminated vaccines. Those are long gone by now, and I felt safe getting vaccines for my baby.

PfE6bg5iaa	That's not a blood clot, it's the lining of the uterus that you shed when you're on your period. It's not just blood, it's tissue too. The tissue lining your uterus builds up throughout your cycle in order to support a fertilized egg. Blood vessels and nerves grow into this lining during the month. Then it's all pulled off (cramps due to the nerves being torn) and flushed out. Completely normal.    Blood clots form in your veins and arteries and restrict blood flow to a particular body part or organ. They usually start in your legs leading to swelling and pain. They can break free and travel through your blood stream which is called an "embolus." That's when they get really dangerous and can travel to your heart and lungs.|`|7p0TO6ePaa	it's normal you just recently started your fine. dont freak out about this happened to me to trust me. and thats nota blood clot at all. you would be feeling lots of pain and terrible blood pressure if you had clots.

For over a year my father was on different tablets back and forth to the doctor, he eventually ended up with a camera down his throat, where they found the bacteria that caused the problem and gave him tablets that would get rid of it, only one type of tablet would work for him and my aunt. I don't know about my aunt(never see her eat) but with my father it effected him a lot, he stopped eating most food and on a night out he would stop at one drink because it would be painful for him.    So, I suggest keep a log of what you eat and when the pain happens in relation to your eating and go to the doctor with that.

g6zhJQRyaa	Along with taking practical medicines and medical advice from your physician, the practice of yoga can help in the healing.    Here is a copy of an article on how yoga and other healthful everyday practices can improve your overall health and your immune system:      Building Your Immune System       The immune system is a network of glands, nodes, and organs that work to protect the body from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other harmful organisms. The immune system requires a constant supply of energy and nutrients to maintain optimum function and performance. Toxins in the environment and in our food, poor diet, lack of or excessive exercise, and stress can all adversely effect the function of the immune system and can cause a decline in its proper activity. Without the immune system functioning at optimum levels, the body becomes subject to illness, infections and health problems.     The immune system consists of the thymus gland, the spleen, lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, mammary), and other organs. These organs are involved in the process of generating and circulating immune cells and certain molecules (ie antibodies). Many factors play a role in strengthening and maintaining the immune system:     *Balanced Diet, Plentiful in Vitamins and Minerals  Antioxidants like vitamin C and E protect the body against free radicals. Free radicals can be produced or brought into the body through poor diet, alcohol, pollutants, smoking, and X-rays. Free radicals attack all cells in the body including the cells of the immune system. Antioxidants bind to free radicals and neutralize them, thus eliminating their damaging effects and help maintain the function of the immune system. Getting the recommended daily intake for these vitamins can be quit easy: 60 mg vitamin c (1 orange), 10 mg vitamin E (2 tbsp olive oil).     *Hatha Yoga  Practice of Yoga Poses     Yoga poses that twist and compress organs help massage and rejuvenate immune organs and channels.     The practice of Yoga also generates balanced energy  vital energy required by the immune system.     Other key poses can create specific benefits to improving immune function:    -Kurmasana (Tortoise pose) supports the thymus gland    -Inversions and Forward Bends like Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog pose) improve the flow of the sinuses and help flush mucous from the lungs  -chest and lung openers like Ustrasana (Camel pose), Yoga Mudra and Bhujangasana (Camel pose) also increase lung mobility and flush out the lungs  -restorative Yoga poses (supported and gravity based) can provide healing benefits during low periods of energy     *Stimulate the Thymus Gland  The thymus gland is located behind the chest bone (sternum) in the upper portion of the chest. Its primary function is the production of peptide hormones which appears to be essential for the normal development of T lymphocytes (T cells) and the immune system. The thymus gland is proportionally large in infants and children, but diminishes in size and effectiveness throughout adulthood.     One can stimulate the thymus gland and its function with a gentle exercise: daily, tap repeatedly on the center of the chest bone for a few minutes. The vibrations of the tapping reach through into the thymus tissues.     *Improve Circulation and Oxygen Flow with Regular Exercise  Moderate exercise (ie brisk walking for 30-60 minutes) daily will improve function and flow of the circulatory and lymphatic system, thus helping provide oxygen and nutrients for immune system organs and cells. Improving oxygen flow creates better transfer of energy from nutrients to cells.     Take note: studies have shown that excessive amounts of exercise can decrease immune function as the overloading of tissues from exercise strips the immune system of energy. This energy is taken from the immune system to repair overloaded/strained tissues and to aid in post-exercise recovery.     Other Useful Tips:   *Rest When Symptoms of Colds or Flus Appear   Avoid exercise and heavy workloads as well as make extra efforts to reduce stress. During the pre-stages of colds and flus, the immune system requires extra energy to produce immune agents to combat viruses. Exercise and stress take valuable energy away from the immune system.     *Stress Reduction  Stress has been shown to weaken the immune system. Yoga, meditation, and other relaxation techniques reduce and eliminate stress.     *Natural Antibacterials and Immune Boosters  Finely chopped or grated FRESH garlic produces a natural antibacterial agent. Garlic that has pre-chopped will not have the same effect as this antibacterial agent has been shown to be present only when garlic is freshly cut.     *Wash Your Hands  The transmission of many bacteria and viruses are through touch. By washing your hands frequently, you significantly reduce your chances of having harmful organisms moving into the body. Also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth when outside of the home and when others in the home are dealing with a cold or flu.   ---|`|v2ZBawa7aa	Ankylosing spondylosis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease.  It is generally treated with anti-inflammatory medication and sometimes medications that decrease the functioning of the immune system.  It's a chronic disease and can vary in the severity.  In some people it's mildly painful and uncomfortable, but in some people it can become severe and debilitating.  The severity of the symptoms largely dictate the treatment.    http://www.spinaldisorders.com/spinal/in...

Wu0XyNspaa	You mean a registered dietitian (RD)?    You have to attend a post-secondary school that has the option of nutritional sciences as a degree.  After you're finished the degree (usually 4 years), you apply for a dietetic internship, which lasts an average of 8-9 months.  Then I believe you have to take a test and register with Dietitians of Canada.    This is the most recognized nutritionist degree.  Otherwise, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist.  Most people will only go to a dietitian, unless you're specializing in natural health.

BOaaKdViaa	Oil blocks the glands on your eyelids causing styes or chalazions. It is the same as a pimple or zit on your face. You have to clean your eyelids to prevent them. Use baby shampoo to your lids or try a product from the drug store called Ocusoft Lid Scrubs. They both get rid of excess oils. And use warm/hot compresses when you have a stye to get rid of it faster.

yE2vM76naa	I think its that as a country of "rugged individualists" we hear bad things that can happen in countries with socialized medicine (granted, they represent 5% of cases) and we say "Oh no! not that! I would rather have what I know to be bad, than to risk what I'm not familiar with that could be bad!"    Its a form of contempt prior to investigation if you ask me.  Just my two cents.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Because of semantic political rhetoric.  If you disagree with someone's point of view that is more liberal than yours, then you accuse them of being "socialist" or "communist."  And it goes both ways .... people tend to call people who are more conservative then they are "redneck."    Unfortunately, in the media, these are usually the only points of view we see.  If it is extreme and sensational, i.e. "you're a communist" "no you're a redneck" then it gets on the news.  The news is all about ratings.  And the sad part is, people actually listen to hacks like Bill O'Reilly .... it's like the whole political atmosphere on TV is so obviously a joke but people swear by these opinionated, extremist idiots instead of forming coherent opinions by themselves.  What the hell gave O'Reilly or Michael Moore and legitimacy anyway?  Wow.  They have a college degree.  They are marketable.  Big ******* deal.  They are humans just like you and me, yet they get more power and influence millions of Americans' opinions.|`|AA10481903	History!|`|OL2aENUVaa	Well, communism is an off shoot of socialism. Socialism means government controlled. Do you really want the people who brought us Katrina and the Iraq war running your healthcare?

How about the government telling you which doctors you can visit and when, and also send you to a "fat camp" against your will if you become obese (prevention is cheaper)? That's how it is in countrys like Germany that has socialized medicine.

The way to hear God is to let him work through your life. By accepting God and his son's sacrifice, you are able to access the holy spirit. Through the holy spirit, your life is changed forever. Your outlook on life, and the way you feel about things- change. By having the holy spirit God gives you wisdom, and guides you through  everyday events. But it isn't a walk through the park, it requires giving up sin in your life- that may be hindering your access to God, and studying God's word. Pray that you could hear God, and that he could work through your life.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Nobody can actually hear God. I mean, the closest you can get to hearing God, is by going to Church, reading the bible, praying and maybe hear him in your dream that might be exactly how he sounds.    Other than that, I don't think you will ever hear God personally. Well, at least not until you pass away and see God for yourself.

958e8b8fd2dbc26508bfdb3f63eae9e6aa	Mono is a flu-like illness caused by a virus called the Epstein Barr Virus.  It causes extreme fatigue and sore throat and swelling of lymph nodes all over your body.  It also causes your spleen to enlarge since a main function of the spleen has to do with white blood cells that are fighting the virus...anyway that is why your left rib cage area would be sore, your spleen is enlarged.  There is no cure, but it usually goes away after a few weeks.  Just drink lots of fluid and rest a lot.  Your body has to fight the virus and it takes a lot out of you.|`|Z0SiMz7daa	Mono is a viral illness.  It can present with symptoms such as sore throat, swollen lymph nodes (glands). excessive tiredness.  The pains that occur under the left rib cage are related to the spleen during mono.    If the only symptom you have is the soreness under your left rib cage I doubt that it is mono.  Keep an eye on it for a couple of days, if it persists go to the MD.

yDJiiqcsaa	Some people have addictive tendencies.  When you get involved with something (activity, sport, relationships etc) can it be a lukewarm, mild interest or is it "all or nothing" ?   If you tend to dive in without reserve and you have family members that have been "examples" in addiction....you'd better be careful.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Maybe but not necessarily if you control yourself and know when you should stop you should be fine.|`|9LNXNABtaa	No.  Drink responsibly and No You Will Not!|`|QykYW3R7aa	There is really no definite answer.  You need to really examine yourself and find out if you have an addictive personality.  This doesn't mean you will become an alcoholic, but it will increase your risk.  Genetics has also proven to be a major predictor of addictions.  But here again, it does not automatically mean you will become an alcoholic...  Be concious of how much you drink.  If you cannot control it or it begins to impact your life negatively, such as causing you to neglect other things such as sleep, nutrition, hygeine, etc. then you have a problem.  If you can't do it in moderation, don't do it at all.  And most importantly, be careful on the occasions when you do drink.  Always have a DD!! I can't stress that enough.|`|e9gquPeRaa	Your personality and willpower will define wether or not you will be a casual drinker or an alchoholic. For some one drink can change their life, because that one drink turns into two and then three and soon they're out all night drinking. Yet for others they don't feel compelled to drink at all. This is the case for the majority of people I'd say. Make sure that when you do start drinking to take it slow and don't start drinking at parties or big events. These situations can cause peer-pressure and cause you to behave differently then you'd like ex.Drinking. Best of luck to you and be safe.

If your legs just ache and you "can't" move them because they hurt, that is probably just because of your fever.  If you physically cannot make your legs move you need to see a doctor.  Something serious could be going on.|`|hci2me2kaa	Have you ever been vaccinated for it? Regardless call a doctor. I don't know what country you live in but it's pretty rare in the US|`|Z0SiMz7daa	Not likely polio but I would be concerned about not being able to move legs.  There is an illness called Guillan Barre that manifests with paralysis of the legs and it is progressive and goes from the bottom to the top, i.e. feet to the neck over a period of time.  Usually follows a viral infection, is not a common condition.      See someone about the paralysis.|`|s3pkflYdaa	I seriously doubt that, because they give the vaccine to babies.
E64juLwJaa	You could always see a Dr :why not?  Planets.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	It is probably just friction as has already been stated. You punching yourself in the chest to stop it from hurting sounds a bit abnormal.|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	the friction of your shirt while running is irritating your nipples. Apply some Vaseline before you run and after to stop the irritation. This is completely normal and if you need to see a doctor then go ahead. That's why they are there.|`|YCPgsvV9aa	Had this happen to me, feels like your nipples are going to fall off? Its normal, mine passed in a few days. When your running, it should'nt bother you.|`|vlki0YmHaa	I guess you could see a doctor, but the weather that day could have been colder than what you're used to, in which those effects are very common during cold temperatures. Breathing all that cold air into your lungs kind of creates that feeling.|`|m80X2a70aa	i think i hadthe same thing. it happened to me between 13 to 15 and i got like these disk things under my nipples and they hurt so bad. i thought i was growing boobs. it finally went away, but it came and went for like 2 years.

I don't believe it's legal for 'girls' to watch it though, as there's an age limit on viewing sexually explicit material, buying adult toys, etc.|`|qMu6Tdrhaa	Its ok.  Its just a bad habit  that if other people figure out about, they might make fun of you.|`|7c2571e9091198afe5dda0493611d4e9aa	No, there's definitely nothing wrong with girls watching porn.

Totally normal.|`|QFzgJWz2aa	yep...its normal|`|I8MUpN04aa	it is neither normal nor abnormal. some girls like it, and some girls don't. if you like it, then that is normal for you. but that doesn't mean that everybody is the same. it takes all kinds of people to make the world go round.|`|4e7c15c0412290b475dc6c53a1810cd2aa	my girlfriend seems to enjoy watching|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	it's very normal.  you just need to be able to distinguish between normal watching and addiction|`|Vh3v0aV4aa	its normal.|`|4JqwBJTSaa	It's normal.|`|Rx0ae0suaa	It's fine and normal.

kyjABj70aa	Obviously there are good and bad parts of smoking weed, I've experienced quite a bit of these, having smoked weed for years.    Pros -  - Calms you down  - Seems to help people perform better sexually (seriously.)  - Though I smoke, I think weed is better for you.  - Often helps put you to sleep    Cons -  - Expensive in some areas, and with some types  - Hard to sneak, especially when moving into your own place  - If you don't have the chance to smoke inside, can be a pain in the winter  - In my boyfriend's case, in particular, it's possible that you won't be able to fall asleep without it.    Hope this helps!|`|45f427df1deeccc715106e52ff789d64aa	WEED CANNOT KILL YOU NOR DOES IT CAUSE DAMAGE TO BRAINCELLS. the only bad things about cannabis is smoke of anykind is bad for the lungs, legal issues, and money. Please do not believe all of the government scare tactics!  I advise you to do a google search about marijuana and find out as much as you can and decide for yourself.|`|6tw7g44haa	the bad side is that it will eventually damage your lungs if you do it enough unless you use a vaporizer or eat it.  Using a bong helps filter the smoke also.  It will make you lazy and a little bit dumber for a day or so after, but other then that its fine.|`|LcdRdyttaa	great times.|`|8YMkyvhyaa	Dont listen to them. I dont mean to be nerd or anything but Weed CAN kill you. it is very dangerous to your body and your mind. you become a whole different person that is NOT you. the short term effects sure, are going to seem great at first. but the long term effects can be horrible. not to mention if you get caught smoking it, you can go to jail and get fined over 1000 dollars.
GWU3Mclnaa	The disposable and reusables are exactly the same. Just make sure you keep them clean. They'll also last longer if you don't sleep in them. As for which brand to get, see if the eye doc can give you a couple of different ones to try; some feel better than others. I personally, prefer the O2 Optix. They are much more comfortable for me that Acuvue.|`|ENtaLmvbaa	i wear reusable contacts.  i find it silly, pointless and very wasteful to use those "daily" contacts that you only wear once.  you say money isn't an issue, but it should be.  why waste your hard earned money?|`|joa30mM8aa	I have weekly Oasis...they are good|`|Mu7Dg37caa	I wore contacts for 10 years (before getting Lasek). I used both reusable and disposable, and preferred reusable. I could usually make a disposable pair last for a week, and would get about 3 months out of reusable. I used Acuvue lenses. I would also switch between glasses and contacts. The reusable contacts held up much better to regular cleaning.|`|RMppfinbaa	Focus Daily extra hydrating are awesome!!! Getting reusable is bad, if you get an eye infection, your contact gets infected. If you lose it, you have a use another one (that's a whole month wasted theoretically speaking).|`|9KUrUIzIaa	my optomotrist gave me a trial of acuvue Oasis and i really like them. they're not as dry.   aren't reusable and disposable alike?  just don't get the 1-year pair of contacts.     one of the optomistrists lectured me for using them.
i4ceTwqLaa	I have that disease too.     The only cure for it is something new to pique my interest and hold my distraction long enough for the next one to kick in.    My whole family is like that.  My boyfriend and sister-in-law were even laughing at me and my brother a Christmas time....my bf was like "I bought her a rubiks cube. That should keep her out of my hair for 2 weeks". Then my sister in law laughed and said "I already did that one. He figured it out in a week, so now I've got him on a 4x4 cube".     They find it funny. They said we reminded them of monkeys trying to figure out a puzzle....    I guess we are like that though. But, I like it. I've even sometimes wondered...What will be the next obsession?    And truthfully, I still love all of my past obsessions like they were children of a sort.    Astronomy, guitar playing, crosswords, old literature, antiques, restoring cars....I've been through a weird little gamit. I think I just NEED something to feed my mind.    (I guess some people smoke weed instead, so, it's no so bad).|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Yeah I do that too!|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	i do that too, its weird.  i guess if you have a problem with it, try to get obssesed with more than one thing so you'll have a normal amount of your life spent on it...if that makes sense  xP|`|4WFtzJheaa	I have been through exactly the same thing. It's hard to snap out of and I am still trying to figure it out too. I think the most important thing is to learn to be able to recognize it while it's starting to happen, and then try to distract yourself with something else. But, I don't think it's such a bad thing, in fact I think it can be really good in small bursts, the key is to not let it dominate your life or warp your thinking. It could be OCD, if it's unhealthy obsession.|`|9LNXNABtaa	sometimes I do that too.|`|C0iCdsFuaa	sheyittt.. yea =] you'll always see me obsessing over something =]|`|z7BTeUKvaa	No, obsession isn't normal.|`|oQQ9DF9oaa	Its called passion.|`|RIC3K10paa	It's called OCD, something I delt with for 2 years until I started taking lexapro which helped a lot!!!|`|iyeADRwaaa	i do that too, but not in a good way  first i had an unhealthy obssesion with harry potter  then i was obssesed with fred  then there was my ipod {still obssesed with that}  then there was twilight {then people totally ruined it}  then there is my psychotic obssesion with suicide {its ruining my life and it might possibly end my life too}
K7x1RHVFaa	Try Ginseng, Acai Berry, and Green Tea.    You might also start sleep in naps, studying feverishly, working on the speed of your answers and exercise your body as well.

You can take ketamine, which is nice, but you won't be going anywhere for a while.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	That is a good birth control pill and many women take it.  You just start taking them the Sunday after you start your period and take a pill every day.  If you start taking them during your period, you should be protected from pregnancy after taking 7 pills.  If you take them every day at about the same time without fail, you should be 99% protected against getting pregnant.  No method is completely safe and there are no guarantees, but it is as good as anything especially if he pulls out.

In your case it looks like migraine.      You need some rest.  If you are working check out some leave of absence.  Change your environment and go for a vacation.  Somewhere you can really relax and watch nature unfolds.  I hate recommending headache tablets for person.  It is best if it can go away on its own.  So, I recommending rest go in relaxation mode; and destress.
FhtQDDm2aa	if you start running and working out then you could lose weight + eat healthy (of course). you will also ecome strong too.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Eat more vegetables, eat less food overall, and exercise more. Never eat enough food to make yourself full.
DKnBzCUpaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.       Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.   Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.   Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.   Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.   Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.   Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.     Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.org or http://www.super-growth.com with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height enhancer for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to grow taller".|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Yes, 1 good way of growing faster is getting lots and lots of sleep. Because, you only grow when you sleep, so every night get 8 or more hours of sleep. Every day you must get 8 or more hours of sleep, if you miss 1 day can really slow down your bone growth in your body.    Hope I helped !|`|vZToCRVuaa	drink loads of milk
ohx1RwEkaa	well no, THC is a psychoactive substance, side effects like dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, loss of coordination and poor reaction time are symbolic to changes in the respiratory which of course fluctuates blood through your body and controls your heart. Having lost amounts of blood doesn't mean your body functions 'slower' or differently, blood still pumps through the very same routes. THC mostly affect the brain (loss of memory) due to over haled hippocampus and amygdala that reinforce the stored Information. No worries, you gonna be alright.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	It's bad.

6f52c047b2a7fd8bfc275fa11892816caa	Eat healthly (No junk) and regularly - smaller portions often.  Low fat, preferably made from scratch meals - ready meals are full of sugars even in the low fat ones.  Carbs are essential for energy so you can't cut them out, but you can have sweet potatoes instead of chips. Wholegrain pasta and rice.  Fruit, veg and lean meats, chicken, fish.  Ibizia party animal? No alcohol for three months - yes I said no drinking for three months!! Huge calories and sugars in alcohol. Start drinking again (in moderation) a month before you go on holiday (so you're not a complete lightweight and legless by 10!!)  Exercise! Walk, take the stairs, lunges, sit ups, press ups, tricep dips, leg raises, squats - all things you can do anywhere if you can't go to the gym.    You might not get as "skinny" as your mates by the time you go on holiday but to that I'll add two points -   boys like curves on real girls  and if you've lost a stone and a bit (for example) you're going to feel happier in yourself, more confident and therefore sexier. Sexiness is a state of mind more than a physical experience.    Have fun!|`|UZKg2odzaa	just be smart about what you eat.   reduce your fat intake and when you are hungry, instead of going for fries grab a piece of fruit. diets dont really work, you have to develop a healthy lifestyle. eat wheat bread, lots of veggies, protein, and lean meats.   working out helps alot as well so develop a habit of going to the gym a few times a week.|`|th0r1ddKaa	you should cut out wheat products  i lost like 10 pounds and i feel healthier too|`|AA12338050	Eat small portions every 2-3 hours, watch your carbs, don't eat after 6:00PM and exercise a few times a week.

I5AxDuOYaa	you cannot stop your period unless you do something you are not supposed to do at a young age or any age until you get married and have a HUSBAND to support your needs at the time...you should tell your mom i'm sure she would be thrilled!

AA11865529	Cold sores are a herpes virus, which can affect the nerves, it even travels along the nerves. It probably is setting off the TN. I hope you are seeing a neurologist and not a family doctor. There are new treatments for TN. The Mayo clinic link below has more information, including alternative therapies    Herpes is affected by physical and emotional stress, which is why you can go long periods between outbreaks. Just make sure you NEVER touch the cold sore and then the area around your eye. You can end up blind doing that.|`|61cb79277cf9b7d41cec94744ccd4197aa	This is not an answer to your question, but I may be able to help with the cold sores in the future.  There is a product called original Alka Seltzer in a blue box.  At the first tingle of an outbreak, take two dissolved in about three to four ounces of water.  Do this morning and night for a few days.  The cold sore will stopped in its tracks.|`|DWsQyHlnaa	I agree with answer regarding the Herpes Virus. I have this and get them on my upper lip and nose and it does travel along the nerves and can be quite painful. You might want to talk to your primary doctor about getting a prescription for one of these meds Zovirax, Famvir, or Valtrex. You need to take it as soon as you start to feel the tiniest hint of a tingle on your lip. Don't wait until you have the sores.    I only get them when my resistance is low due to illness or I am extremely tired from lack of sleep.|`|EQydFhzmaa	Fibromyalgia?|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Call your doctor, good luck.
958e8b8fd2dbc26508bfdb3f63eae9e6aa	All you really have to do is lie down in the machine.  MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) uses a big magnet to excite the water molecules in your body and then take a picture as the electrons move. (hard to describe in detail in a paragraph!)  Anyway, it is a PAINLESS way to look at soft tissue in the body like brain, muscle, tendon etc... and it also can help look at blood vessels and even bones (although CT scans are better for bone.)  Don't worry about it, it can be noisy, but it won't hurt.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	An MRI is a test where they can see soft tissue injuries and abnormalities. It involves laying on a table that slides into a capsule like tube. Most places play music to drown out the sound of banging on a metal trash can with your head in it. If your claustrophobic, meaning you dont like small enclosed spaces, ask your dr for an open MRI, or an antianxiety pill before the test. It takes about  45min or so depending on what is being scanned. Good Luck.|`|emNCaAq7aa	An MRI is like an Xray but it shows things like tendons, ligaments and muscle better. XRay basically just shows bones.  Most have you lay down on a Formica table. The table goes into a tube and you hear a lot of noise, like banging. There is no pain and the only thing that is uncomfortable is the table and the noise. some people are claustrophobic and have problems with the tube. If you can get on an elevator you should have no problems.   You cannot wear anything that might be magnetic, the system works on strong magnetic fields.  It is usually over in 45 or less minutes. It depends on what they are looking for. Unlike Xray there is no radiation problem.
sosisPXbaa	http://www.acne.org/  under get clear, select: start here    basically, the gist of what they say there is (they also provide video demonstations):    --wash your face for only 30 seconds with a very mild cleanser (one that produces a lot of thick lather), rinse thoroughly and pat your face dry with a towel    --once your face is dry, apply a coat of 2.5% benzoil peroxide to your entire face, massaging it very gently until it gets absorbed by the skin.    --after that dries, apply some light, oil free, non-pore clogging moisturizer--preferably with some spf     --do this once when wake up and once when you goto bed.      I had suffered from really bad acne for almost a decade... this website changed my life years ago.  if i hadn't come across it, I would still have sever cystic acne covering my entire face.  i had tried a plethora of treatments: salycilic acid, erythromycin, benzomycin, tetracyclin, etc... the P. acnes would eventually become immune to the antibiotics    the reason daniel kern's method works is because it's preventive, and it's very gentle on your skin.  it's similar to Proactiv but its' even gentler and way way less expensive.  most treatments can overdry and irritate your skin causing more oil production and breakouts.  best thing about this method is you don't have to buy treatments that belong to any specific brand.  TRUST ME this worked when nothing else would, except for accutane--but that has the potential for serious side effects.      do not use soap and alcohol for goodness sakes!    just try what they say on the website and stick to it for a few weeks. you'll notice a huge difference but you have to do it exactly as they tell you.    you can join the forums to chat with other people who suffer too, but be warned some of their forums are way too emo.    one last pro tip: you have to do it every day; don't slack when you see results.|`|AA11693263	My kids (ages 12 to 18) use the Clean and Clear. If its drying your skin out then only use it once a day instead of twice. Or just don't put it in the place that gets dry. Are you using the spot treatment (the littlest tube) on the place that gets dry? If so, try not using it there for a few days. Also, you could just wash your face with a non-drying cleanser (St. Ives Apricot Cleanser is a good one, it has the same ingredient (Salicylic Acid) as the Clean and Clear and is milder.) Then use the Clean and Clear moisturizer and spot treatment and see if that works. That's actually what I am using right now as well as my 15 year old and it is working well for us. Not too drying and the little apricot seed bits in it are a great exfoliater.|`|bPMYTuk5aa	May be you should try some herbal cream for your pimples.

SDFTzz5qaa	It's not really as harmful as the government would like you to believe. The Shafer commission, an independent commission of scientists set up in the Nixon era to review marijuana had even concluded that there were no potential health risks or at least none great it enough to keep it illegal, yet it is.    You can't overdose from pot. You would need to consume 40,000x the amount it takes you to get high, compared with 4 to 10 times the amount needed to get drunk for alcohol.     It doesn't kill brain cells. This myth was heavily based off of a biased and skewed research project with rheeus monkeys back in the 1960s i believe. It does make some of them "dormant" or working at only half capacity for a period of about 7 months. Even if it does kill brain cells, it mainly affects the hippocampus section of the brain, which is ironically the only part of the brain that can regenerate brain cells.    It is not a gateway drug. Amsterdam hasn't seen an increase in hard drug usage, despite marijuana's heavy presence there.  Also, to quote the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicines 1999 report, Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:  "There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs  There is no evidence that marijuana serves as a stepping stone on the basis of its particular physiological effect  Instead, the legal status of marijuana makes it a gateway drug."    Also, marijuana has not been linked to an increase in lung cancer. Coming from the MPP.org's FAQ page: "Unlike tobacco, research has never shown that marijuana increases rates of lung cancer or other cancers usually associated with cigarette smoking. In a 10-year, 65,000-patient study conducted at the Kaiser-Permanente HMO and published in 1997, cigarette smokers had much higher rates of cancer of the lung, mouth, and throat than non-smokers, but marijuana smokers who didn't smoke tobacco had no such increase."    This conserative is right in one aspect. Today's weed isn't your grandparents. While the potency has remained relatively the same despite common belief, many will tell you marijuana is SAFER today than it once was. The war on drugs have caused a shift from the moldy, dusty, pesticide ridden weed from foreign countries for more domestic producers that are kept safe from these conditions.     Marijuana is not addictive, or has not proven to be...only that it MIGHT be psychologically addictive, but the majority of those who tend to become "addicted" are those that have addictive personalities. Do not listen to the scare tactics. There is not crack in your marijuana, or heroin in it, or ecstacy, or coke. Those drugs tend to be exponentially more expensive than marijuana, and would be a waste to drug dealers adding stuff to it to get you hooked. The only thing it may be laced with is PCP, but it's extremely rare. If you hear anyone say dust, or sherm, stay the hell away from that weed. And even if this was true, wouldn't this be more of a reason to legalize it? To help ensure that people are consuming cannabis and only cannabis?    Marijuana doesn't affect intelligence. Some of the world's most brilliant people have used/use marijuana. I'm maintained a 3.9GPA  throughout college and high school, and I used to smoke like a chimney. The only way it could affect performance in school is if you go to class high, because marijuana does affect the short-term memory. This does not mean it kills your memory like some people twist it to believe. It means that while you are under the influence of marijuana, your brain may have trouble forming new memories, a side-effect that wears off with the high.    Bottom line, I'm not going to tell you to try it. Research up on it, and make an informed decision. Check www.erowid.org. It's a non-biased, independently funded organization that provides both the negative and positives about not only marijuana but every other drug/pharmaceutical known to man.    Above all else, don't go to class or drive high. Be responsible.|`|KC5vBg4uaa	You'll never know if you don't try it.    It isn't addictive, so don't listen to anybody who says that if you try it once you'll never stop taking it.  I have only done it twice in my life, and I have not felt any addiction towards it.  The first time I didn't enjoy it too much.  The second time was the happiest day of my life.    Just to warn you though, part of the reason I didn't like it the first time was because I wasn't really expecting the high to feel like it did, so let me tell you sort of what it feels like:    A high feels like your body does everything for you on instinct.  In reality though, it just temporarily impairs your short term memory, so it makes it kind of hard to remember why you are doing something.  Eventually though, you get used to it and remember things, but then time feels really slow because a memory from 2 seconds ago feels like minutes ago.  It also makes you feel very comfortable and tired (I never really got hungry, but when I did eat, it tasted really good).  It also makes you really show your emotions, so if you're happy you'll be really happy but if you're sad you'll be really sad.  So just try to sit back and listen to music and be happy.  Part of the reason I didn't like it the first time was that I was really nervous and anxious going into it and then I started getting paranoid.  One more thing, being high makes you laugh at everything even if it isn't funny.    So anyway, as long as you don't let it get in the way of the rest of your life, marijuana should be fine.  Just try to do it once a week at most.  And be prepared for what you're getting into.  If you're feeling nervous at all, try to sit back, relax, and be happy.  Music really helps.  I danced to songs that I normally would never listen to.  Just try to imagine that a band is playing right in front of you.    The high should last around 4 hours, but you should be thinking somewhat normally after 1 hour.  And remember, time feels like it's going really slow because your memories are messed up, so if you think it's already been 4 hours it's probably only been an hour.  Check your watch every once in a while if you need to check.    Finally, Marijuana does not kill brain cells.  It temporarily paralizes them, but they should work fine again once you're no longer high.  There are relatively no dangers of smoking it occationally.  Just try to avoid driving a car, although it is much safer than drunk driving because you're more relaxed so you drive slower and more carefully.  Also, you'll cough a lot, so have a cold drink on hand.    The most important thing is to have fun.  Good luck!      EDIT:  To the Lady above me.  Please explain this:  I first tried marijuana this year.  I also made the honor roll for the first time this year (this is my fourth year of high school) was able to correct my constant lates to school (I had 112 lates to school last year, only 6 this year) and did better on the SATs than everyone in my class who I've asked except for one amazingly smart girl (I got a 2240 out of 2400, she got a 2400).  Must be all those dead brain cells that did that, right?    Also, explain to me why the last time I did marijuana was over a week ago even though it was the happiest day of my life, while I have some urge to open solitaire everytime I open my start menu, even though I get very little enjoyment out of it.  I think I just gave you a new anti-marijuana phrase, "Marijuana is almost as addictive as computer solitaire!"    Here's a quote from Wikipedia:  "...recent studies have been unable to demonstrate a direct link between lung cancer and frequent direct inhalation of marijuana smoke. While many researchers have failed to find a correlation, some researchers still conclude that marijuana smoke poses a higher risk of lung cancer than tobacco. Some studies have even shown that the non-psychoactive ingredient CBD found in marijuana may be useful in treating breast cancer."    It does state that heavy long term use can lead to heart attacks or strokes (over five joints a day) but nothing about one single joint killing your brain cells.    Here are some statistics of annual drug deaths in the US:  http://drugwarfacts.org/cms/?q=node/30    Good source for myths and facts about marijuana:  http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/fact...    Also, if you have two hours, here's a good documentary about the Marijuana industry:  http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...|`|ah59G9KVaa	  ITS GREAT.|`|umbWaDBXaa	Ya it's GREAT alright!  So great that it destroys your brain cell, lungs, IQ, can affect your heart, liver, etc.  To put it plain and simple, it makes you STUPID and UNHEALTHY and anyone telling you different has no respect for themselves or anyone else.  It doesn't always happen over long term either.   Smoking one joint is like smoking a pack of cigarettes.  That's how bad it affects your lungs.  Research this.  There is plenty of medical research on it.  Ppl who say its GREAT are only considering the "high" off of it and not the physical and mental effects of it.  Its your choice.  Being young has its advantages but just remember, everything you do in your youth that is negative on your mental and physical health will affect you twice as much when you get older. Once you kill brain cells they are gone forever.  Brain cells do NOT regenerate.    Hope you make the right choice on this.  Good luck to you!  Also it has been proven by medical research and testing that the mariquana going around these days IS addictive!  You never really know what you are getting and so many ppl add stuff to it that makes you get addicted to it so you will keep coming back and buying more.  Also mariquana these days is so much more potent than ever before!  So, don't listen to ppl who tell you it isn't addictive bc it certainly can be! And the one guy on here telling you how good it is and how it does not kill brain cells is proof that it does, indeed, kill brain cells.  Don't listen to ppl who try to get you try drugs of any kind.  They are on the "high" road to NOWHERE!|`|45f427df1deeccc715106e52ff789d64aa	dont listen to lady! i completly agree with DAK try it, it wont kill you or braincell the gov. full of bullshit!

But yes you would be gaining endurance, not so much muscle because you are just running.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	I don't believe that is an adrenaline rush.  More likely a release of endorphins from exhaustion.      Your body will continue to develop muscle and tone if you continue to exercise.  Pushing yourself beyond varying levels of endurance is how athletes develop, or reach, their "personal best".      Your body has limits.  Only you can determine what they are, and whether its worth the price to reach that limit.

958e8b8fd2dbc26508bfdb3f63eae9e6aa	I did this diet for 1 week.  It was very hard!  The lemonade just starts to make you sick after a few days.  My advice is to omit the cayenne pepper, it makes it hard to drink every day.  I did lose 10 lbs though.  I have actually kept it off.  You are not supposed to eat anything though, just drink the lemonade.  I never felt sick on the diet, but I did start to feel weak towards the end of the week.  Try it, but don't go longer than a week.  Honestly, I would not do it again since it was so hard, and I really think there are better ways to lose weight...BUT it is a good way to lose weight fast, even if you probably will gain it back shortly after.    Good luck!|`|ZY2GT7edaa	i would not suggest it.....not enough nutrients..ur body will basically be starved, and not enough protein and vitamins will take a toll on your body...ex: hair will become brittle, skin will become dull, lack of energy, etc. if you want to lose pounds, limit calorie intake to 1500 calories, and make an exercise plan. in your diet, incorporate fresh fruits and veggies for vitamins and lean meats for protein as well as small amount of good, complex carbs. cut out junk food and those kind of drinks. milk is good to drink, just stick to nonfat or one percent...good luck to you

If your period doesn't come take a pregnancy test.    Being sick and having a cold can definitely delay your period - that might be why if you turn out not pregnant.    On the discharge - that does sound like the discharge you get after sex - when all the vaginal fluid and semen comes out. Could that be it?|`|xBgKqAPHaa	yeh i think it just means ur about to get ur period  thats wat i get sort of
PAvYZJK2aa	durex or trojan|`|E64juLwJaa	Durex ultra sensitive.  Well the clue is in the name.  Planets|`|NBf5q2f5aa	magnum|`|NICEuXYgaa	anything but durex they are the worst.  I know your going to save some money but who ever you are sleeping with is going to get dried out very fast and it will start to hurt her.  that means no sex for you.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	What is best for someone may not be the best for you  and your partner.  The best thing you can do is, each time, use a different  kind and you will soon which one is best for you and your partner .Experimenting is fun and exciting - so enjoy it and you will soon find what really satisfies you and and your partner.|`|vXTlqHoKaa	I like Lifestyles ultra thin|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Your best bet is to talk to the person at the pharmacy. They will explain the different types and sizes and what may be best for you. There are many varieties and sizes available. They won't be embarrassed and you shouldn't be either.   Personally Durex XXL. why? size.|`|m80X2a70aa	my brother always uses Trojan, so if i had i choice, i would go with them, they feel pretty good to me. idk about a partner though. i think most would be the same.
sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to grow taller naturally".|`|zPUXmaHwaa	if you are concerned about how short you are don't worry about it you will have a growing sprout and you will be taller than everyone maybe not everyone but you will be tall enough to be happy with your self|`|kPalo5Kiaa	eat noble rise bread|`|xd7lHqL2aa	Wear shoes with high heels or platforms.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yes, eat the healthiest diet you possibly can and get exercise including weight bearing exercise.  Only yoga has been shown to do anything at all as far as making you taller, but it doesn't make you grow more, it lengthens your spine.
i0nlqfJVaa	Going off the pill sends your hormones out of whack. It can take up to six months for your period to regulate itself after stopping. It is normal and you should be fine. If not you may need to go back to the doctor.
hp35U4xiaa	They can hurt and make your teeth sore but all the pain is definantly worth it. You do look a little different first but after a couple of days people get used to it and having braces is normal. They will feel weird at first and u mite get sores in your mouth or bite your tongue when you eat but once you get used to them it will feel as normal as when you didnt have braces.  will u asnwer my question click my profile go to my questions then answer what should i weigh|`|w85BPK5Kaa	i have had braces 3 times. i am about experienced as they come. i did everything that i was supposed too, it just took stages. dont worry about that happening to you. but anyways...yes it hurts, for like the first 2 days, but then you get used to it. it really isnt that bad actually. and then you will be sore when you go for adjustments. but other than that their is relatively no pain (or at least i thought so.) are you getting just top or bottom or top and bottom at the same time?|`|JKtthwaMaa	When you first get them, you won't feel the shift of the teeth until the next day. And let me tell you it sucks. Everytime the ortho people change your wires or tighten the teeth, it hurts and you can't eat anything hard. They basically mess up your mouth and then they fix it.  They will also get your hopes up by telling you that you get your braces off soon and then they will tell you that you need them on for a few more months.    Braces suck, but in the long run they are worth it.|`|32dc55740bd2edf352af0cb6491223d5aa	they hurt for a few days, and they kind of cut up the inside of your mouth sometimes, but you get used to it.
KDFHrLluaa	don't worry. listen to your mother. i wasn't "regular" until after i turned 20! even now i'm not textbook regular, my period comes on the day it ended... if that makes sense to you (every 6 months i miss a month because of the timing... i hate it but i know it's going to happen) oh and stressing makes it not come even more , so try not to stress!   put a little symbol in your diary that only you know what it means and keep tack of your period that way.i put a dot next to the day i start and a cross on the day i finish... ok it's not so secret anymore ;o)  by doing this you might find a pattern(this is how i found mine). if your still concerned see your doctor. the pill helped my friends get regular. (i don't like drugs messing up my system)  hope this helps.|`|UZKg2odzaa	one time, i was 12 days late for my period. it's ok to be extremely irregular, it sucks, but you're normal.|`|n6zqu8gKaa	you shouldn't be worried it is normal|`|2538Y6Tqaa	It is completly normal, trust me. I started having my period since I was 10 yrs. old and it sucked bcuz I sometimes wouldn't get it fot monthz at a time. It is completely normal. I'm sure all teenage girls go through it like i do, your fine don't worry about a thing.    - Any more questions just e-mail me back at diamondw_202@yahoo.com
AAgX0SDcaa	You should be eating a balanced diet with lots of vitamin C, it takes vitamin C to build collagen in your body, and you need fatty acids too. Also if you smoke, stop because smoking slows down the red blood cells to your skins, it will age you very quickly, and drink lots and lots of water each day.|`|RZaPnqzWaa	Eats lots of rubber|`|I8MUpN04aa	exercise will help a bit, but a lot of these things are genetic, and you have probably inherited the genes that control how tight your skin is. did your aunts have problems in this area?
xBgKqAPHaa	sure|`|99NNTv6vaa	this is the stupidest question ever. i bet your in like 8th grade.|`|WgIYRyiTaa	Wow lets go **** right now.|`|1jGEeMDYaa	That'll do pig, that'll do.|`|Rx0ae0suaa	No, because you're too arrogant and stupid to even get to the point of seeing your erect penis.|`|2dr0hoU0aa	rtard ur erection doesnt change cuz u see a hot hawter n sexy girl moron..    when u erect u erect to ur fullest ...|`|C0Dj76OMaa	lol nice try.    "7-9 inches, depending on how hot the girl is."  a guy will get a ***** even from the nastiest girl if shes touching him sexually.    my boobs usualy go to around an A cup if i have sex with guys like you.
