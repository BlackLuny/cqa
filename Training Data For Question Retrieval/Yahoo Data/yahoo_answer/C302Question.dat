Warum nehmen sich die deutschen nicht mal die amerikanische filmindustrie als vorbild und investieren mal so richtig und langfristig in diese branche. Gute filme werden immer geschaut.

Wenn ich an die millionen arbeitspl?tze denke die darin stecken:   Bühnenbildner ; Maske ; Regie ; der Produzentenbereich ; Schauspieler ; Techniker ; Caterer ; Schneider ; Kameraleute ; Tontechniker ; die teams von sfx und vfx ; die ges. postproduktion ;    die abtastwerke ; jeder boy oder helfer ; stuntleute ; skript und storyboard usw usw usw usw.

20090305085118AAa70wf	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	LAPD notes..Is chris Brown Career over?	FOX 11 in L.A. obtained LAPD detectives notes from a search warrant in the case. According to the notes, Rihanna read a three-page text message on Brown's phone from a woman. An argument ensued and Brown allegedly tried forcing Rihanna out of the car but couldn't because she was wearing her seat belt.   Brown then allegedly shoved Rihanna's head against the passenger window. When Rihanna turned to face him, Brown punched her, then continued punching her while driving, according to the detective's notes.   Blood spattered all over Rihanna's clothing and in the interior of the car. Her mouth was filled with blood.   Brown allegedly told Rihanna, "I'm going to beat the **** out of you when we get home. You wait and see."   Rihanna called her assistant and left a message saying, "I am on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there."   Brown then replied, "You just did the stupidest thing ever. I'm going to kill you."   According to the report, Brown continued to punch Rihanna, bit her on her ear, her fingers and put her in a headlock -- she almost lost consciousness.      Will this end his career? Why is she back with him? What will happen to him? So disturbing! I hope Rihanna Stands up to him

It should immunize you to everything. Now, it says that you'll probably feel really sick for a few weeks, but, um, after you recover, will you go out with me?"   How would you react?

20090305052826AAljI3V	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why are my horoscopes always the opposite....?	I am a pisces, with a Leo rising and my horoscopes (in magazines, respected books and all places) are always the opposite of what is said!  When I read books about astrology, my Piscean personality traits are very true and accurate.  when I look up pisces with leo rising it is even more accurate, yet the horoscopes never seem to be correct, why is this?  in fact they are usually the complete opposite!  I though this might have something to do with the fact Pisces is a dual sign?

I think this would be a fabulous idea to get Disney's young viewing audience interested in Shakesperian literature, something they really ought to develop, in my opinion.

Do you think this would be feasible?  If so, which play do you think they should make into a film.

Hi, I was watching Family Guy on AdultSwim, and the episode I was watching is called "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One." There is one part in the episode, where they are all swimming in a lake and they lose their hair from pollution in the lake, well long story short, Peter chooses these berocial (spelling?) type wigs and, Stewie says "I feel a bit like Moztart" and then he plays a few short songs on the piano, after that Peter says "Play Peter Griffin.." and then Stewie plays a cool sounding song, I'm not sure if it's a real song or if they just made it up, but if it is a real song, can someone please tell me what it is, I like the way it sounds, and I hope it's a real song.   Thanks!

The weird thing is, this is the second time I have heard this song from two different DJ's in a month, im guessing its something a lot of them have on their play list.  I swear I have heard this song at the beginning of a movie too.  The song is very laid back at the beginning then the trumpet kicks in.  I have tried google and searched all over youtube but with no luck.  Anybody have any idea, I think a lot of DJ's play this.

On the way, Amir and the donkey passed a stream. The donkey jumped in to cool himself. As a result, much of the salt dissolved into the water, ruining the salt for Amir but improving matters for the donkey because his load became much lighter. Amir tried to get to the market on the following days, but the donkey always ruined the salt. Finally, Amir decided to teach the donkey a lesson. He once again set out with the donkey and the two sacks.What did Amir do differently this time so that after that day the donkey stopped taking a swim?

Originally I had thought Jason should have picked Molly....   Aside from that, I totally would not wish what he did to Melissa that was down right dirty and disgusting. He had me fooled big time.   And Molly, it disgusted her to even want to be with Jason after what he did... Not to mention, his little boy watching every move he makes. Jason is so sorry for what he did to Melissa, felt so bad for her.   So basically I am wondering, should there be another season will you continue to watch the show?

20090305085227AA2CtM3	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are your thoughts about using rock music during wartime?	This wasn’t how I wanted to word this but got to walk on eggshells as it pertains to the proper questioning format.  Part of this was inspired by the recent story of the mall using Barry Manilow to ward off the evil packs of loitering teens.  It reminded me of the Panama Invasion back in 1989.  In order to get Manuel Noriega to come out of hiding, the U.S. Military used really loud music, which was then blasted on speakers surrounding his refuge.      MQ1 – What groups were actually used to get Noriega to come out of the embassy? (I’m dying to know this.)   MQ2 – What music would you recommend to the U.S. Military to use in future operations in order to drive out the enemy (like Bin Laden)?

Little Melissa comes home from 1st grade & tells her  father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.        "Since Valentine's Day is for a Christian saint,and we're Jewish," she asks, "Will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?        Melissa's father thinks a bit, and then says:    "No, I don't think God would get mad. To whom do you want to give a Valentine to?"    "Osama Bin Laden," she says.      "Why Osama Bin Laden?" her father asks in shock.      "Well," she says, "I thought that if a     little American Jewish girl could have enough love to give Osama a Valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit.   And if other kids saw what I did and sent Valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them, and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."      Her father's heart swells and he looks at his daughter with new found pride. "Melissa, that's the most wonderful thing I have ever heard."      "I know," Melissa says, "and once that gets  him out in the open, the Marines could shoot the f**ker."
20090305085605AAusE9s	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Have Rihanna and Chris Brown Married & Pregnant?	"In a surprising development in the Rihanna Chris Brown saga, latest reports suggest that the couple secretly tied the knot soon after their reconciliation in Miami.      Brown, who is to undergo his first court hearing for allegedly assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys, proposed to the 20-year-old singer and married her during their Miami getaway at rap mogul Sean Combs USD 20 million mansion.,      Earlier reports had claimed that Rihanna agreed to forgive Brown after she realised that she was pregnant with his child.      The secret wedding was conducted by a minister who was brought in for the spur of the moment ceremony, says a source.       "Rihanna is looking for the husband-and-two-kids deal before she turns 25. She believes in fairy tales, and she wants to live hers with Chris. She was totally up front and confessed to him, 'I can't live without you'", the source said.      The magazine has also published pictures of Rihanna and Brown together during their Miami holiday. The couple had avoided being spotted together after their reported   reconciliation.       The couple were at the centre of controversy when the news broke that the 19-year-old Brown had battered his long time girl friend Rihanna, after she reportedly questioned him over a text message from another woman."   -NDTV.com      I believe that this is a terrible example to give to young women and girls. Would you girls go back to a guy who battered you? Domestic abuse is the least reported crime and these wife beaters should get what they deserve and do some time!       But do you guys think this is true? That she is married now and pregnant?       Is it a move put on by CB's lawyers to save his career? this is pretty ballsy and extreme. did CB brainwash Rihanna? or is Rihanna clueless and just doesn't get it?

He is accompanied to the island by a female companion and another scientist and two children, When they get there, the scientist reveals that he has discovered preserved dinosaur DNA and found a way to clone dinosaurs!!! There is a dinosaur themed adventure park on the island where tourists can take rides and see real life dinos up close! Anyway, some unscrupulous scientist is trying to steal dino eggs and in doing so he turns off the security gates that keep the dinosaurs under control, they escape and wreak havoc on the island! If you have ever heard of something like this, please help me, I'd love to see it again!!!

I'd really like singing lessons because I think I'm an ok singer.. but I've never sung to anyone so I might just be deluded. I want to ask my parents if I can get them but I'm kind of embarrassed because.. I've never really sung in front of them and I've always given them the impression I'm bad and hate singing. What can I do?    Also, where do you find vocal coaches because Yell.com isn't helping. :(   Thanks.

20090305085026AAapVlL	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Lost (TV) in time? What is wrong?	I'm not a big Lost fan. I have watched it on and off through the years. But this year had me more interested that I try not to miss any episode.       So last night was about the people that stayed on the Island. From what I gather, when Lock left, they had one big flash and that I guess still transported them through time. But now they are in some year 1974?    I guess they are living on the island that way for 3 years.       When Lock left he jumped forward almost 3 years? Because when he meets up with the rest trying to talk to them to come back. Almost three years have been gone?      The ones that left the Island left and have been gone for 3 years.    Now when they come back, they fly over the island, a flash happens (that only happens on the plane, not on the Island) and now they are back in 1974??? But the plane crashes still?      Am I right on my timing? Is something strange with that?

20090305085624AAduzzt	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Beginning guitar question and future questions?	Hello, I got a nice Fender acoustic guitar for Christmas and just 2 days ago decided I wanted to really take it seriously and learn how to play.  For the guitar and music theory people and or musical masterminds out there, I have a few questions.  I really want to persue this thing as a career. I don't know anything about guitar or music except a listen to a lot of it. Like I really want to get into the music busniness somehow.  I want to be the guy who knows the music theory, knows how to record, and play the guitar and possibly other instruments.  I'm only 18 and I feel I started a bit late, because I want to hopefully get somewhere making some money by the time I'm in my mid 20s.  When I get into something, I try to understand and know everything about it.  I hope to do that with guitar and music, but it seems it will be hard as not even my whole life could teach me everything there is to know.     I don't want to be just your casual guitar player who made random songs, and that's it, but I always want to learn and persue stuff.  Like I said, I just began playing.  I learned all the major chords for the beginning player, and I ordered Music Theory For Dummies.  I'm watching youtube vids on how to play the beginning of Stairway to Heaven also.  I also have a question about guitar progression.  My dad and other people I know who have only played guitar for like 3 months can switch to a chord really fast like it was easy, while it seems I take my time, like an instant switch to some takes 2 seconds for me to get my fingers right.  I keep thinking, and trying, I improve but I don't get it perfect, and I also don't see how I can progress.  Any help on that would be great.

20090305083035AAj6czD	Entertainment & Music;Movies	My son wants to wear goodnites to the movies so he doesn't have to miss any of the movie. Should I let him?	My 9 year old son wears goodnites for bedwetting (he wets almost every night). He asked if he could wear a pair of them when he goes to the movie theatre. He doesn't want to have to leave for the bathroom and miss any of the movie. I think the movies are longer these days. Batman was two and a half hours. Anyway, should I let him? Would that be inappropriate? It seems kinda gross, but on the other hand, maybe it's good that he feels okay about using the goodnites, even during the day. Maybe it means that his bedwetting won't cause him any self-esteem issues later in life.

20090305092756AAlDuNG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What is a Pink Floyd fan supposed to look like?	Many years ago, when I was in college, a guy I was talking to mentioned that he liked Pink Floyd. When I told him that I also liked Pink Floyd, he said, "You don't look like someone who listens to Pink Floyd!" Amazingly enough, he wasn't the first person to say something like that to me. For example, when I told someone else that I listened to groups like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Queen, he expressed shock and told me that he expected me to be the sort to listen to people like Taylor Dayne or Michael Bolton! (YUCK!) Just what is a person who listens to classic rock supposed to look like, anyway? I'm really curious to know!

20090305101737AALyjM8	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you think is better? please answer?	Please answer this, read the whole thing, I know it's long, sorry.   And give serious answers please with real advice, I don't want joke answers, I'm really serious here.      If you wanted to start acting, would you rather:      1. Join a drama class when none of your friends are in the drama group, and do a school play, live, in front of all of your peers, sitting there watching you front-row center, laughing at you cuz its not a true serious production and its funny because they've never seen you act even though your good at it and they're not into drama at all?      2. Or would you rather be professionally acting in a real blockbuster movie in Hollywood with other professional actors and actresses and extras and professional directors and producers and tutors and stage managers and assistants, etc, behind the camera, not live in front of all your peers, who can't sit there and watch you from the audience, when your doing the acting?         I know before you persue any type of acting you need to join acting classes and get lots of practice and experience, but I would rather not join the drama class at my school or any acting class there or do a play at my school because of the first option above. I'm trying to convince that to my dad. (Im 15, btw)    Do the options make sense to any of you?   Like wouldn't you rather do private acting lessons than doing a play at your school when your friends (who are supportive but like to make jokes to everyone), and all those boys who think its lame and stuff tease you about it?   I mean, i'm truly serious about wanting to act and become an actress and i'm not just thinking about popularity and social rankings and groups and status quo and stuff or whatever, I would just rather do it privately or with peers that I don't know at an acting class, because I'd rather be doing acting secretly, I don't want to tell my friends I'm going into it, I don't want to make a big excitement over it or anything.   Does that make sense?   I'm trying to be as clear as possible, it's hard.   Serious answers, please.   thanks.

When she went down to the docks, a handsome young sailor noticed her tears, took pity on her, and said, "Look, you've got a lot to live for. I'm off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take good care of you and bring you food every day." Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, "I'll keep you happy, and you'll keep me happy."      The girl nodded yes, after all, what did she have to lose? That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love until dawn.      Three weeks later, during a routine search, she was discovered by the captain. 'What are you doing here?' the captain asked. She got up off the ground and explained, "I have an arrangement with one of the sailors. He's taking me to Europe, and he's screwing me."      The captain looked at her, "He sure is lady, this is the River Mersey Ferry

They were posted on an Australian Tourism Website and the answers are the actual responses by the website officials, who obviously have a sense of humor.         Q: Does it ever get windy in Australia? I have never seen it rain on TV, how do the plants grow? (UK).   A: We import all plants fully grown and then just sit around watching them die.      Q: Will I be able to see kangaroos in the street?(USA)   A: Depends how much you've been drinking.      Q: I want to walk from Perth to Sydney - can I follow the railroad tracks?

Q: Are there any ATMs (cash machines) in Australia? Can you send me a list of them in Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville and Hervey Bay? (UK)   A: What did your last slave die of?             Q: Can you give me some information about hippo racing in Australia? (USA)   A: A-fri-ca is the big triangle shaped continent south of Europe. Aus-tra-lia is that big island in the middle of the Pacific which does not... oh forget it. Sure, the hippo racing is every Tuesday night in Kings Cross. Come naked.

20090305100520AAYWkMp	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Heard the one about "The Farther and the Hairdryer"?	A distinguished young woman on a flight from Switzerland asked the   Priest beside her,   'Father, may I ask a favour?'   'Of course what may I do for you?'   'Well, I bought an expensive woman's electronic hair dryer for my   mother's birthday that is unopened and well over the Customs limits, and I'm   afraid they'll confiscate it. Is there any way you could carry it   through Customs for me? Under your robes perhaps?'   'I would love to help you, dear, but I must warn you: I will not lie.'   'With your honest face Father, no one will question you.' She said.    When they got to Customs, she let the priest go ahead of her.   The Official asked: 'Father, do you have anything to declare?'   'From the top of my Head down to my waist, I have nothing to declare.'    The official thought this answer strange and so he asked: 'And what do   you have to declare from your waist to the floor?'   'I have a marvellous instrument designed to be used on a woman, but   which is, to date, unused.' Roaring with laughter, the official said,   'You can go through, Father.'
20090305100223AAVE4Z0	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have you heard the new National security update?	If you're politically correct read no further!           _____         National security update            Our London correspondent reports that, in light of recent terrorist   threats, the British authorities have raised their security level from    "Miffed" to "Peeved"       It would appear that security levels may be raised yet again to    "Irritated" or even "A Bit Cross". Londoners have not been   "A Bit    Cross" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies all but ran out. In    the meantime terrorists have been re-categorised from "Tiresome" to   "A Bloody Nuisance". The last time the British issued a "Bloody   Nuisance"   warning was during the great fire of 1666.       In France the French authorities also announced that it had raised    its terror level from "Run" to "Hide". The only two higher   levels in    France are "Surrender" and "Collaborate". The rise was   precipitated    by a recent fire that destroyed France's only white flag factory,    effectively paralysing the country's military capability.      It's not only the French and English that are on a heightened level    of alert. Italy has increased the alert level from "Shout Loudly and    Excitedly" to "Elaborate Military Posturing". Two more levels   remain:   "Ineffective Combat Operations" and "Change Sides".    Elsewhere in Europe Germany has increased it's alert from "Disdainful    Arrogance" to "Dress In Uniform And Sing Marching Songs". They   also    have two higher levels: "Invade a Neighbour" and "Lose"   Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual and the only       threat they have to worry about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.    The Spanish are in a high state of excitement following the    deployment of their new submarine fleet. These beautifully designed   subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a good view    of the old Spanish navy.    Washington has announced that there will be no change to the strategy    that has served the country so well over the last 100 years. A    spokesperson confirmed that the guiding principles remained as "Sit    on the fence until you know who is winning" followed by "Bomb the    s*** out of everything then find out who's side they were on"
20090305093921AAJzsaG	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Now hears an Oldie but Goodie, would you like to hear it?	A couple are going out for a night on the town. They're all dolled up, ready to go; the lights left on, the dog outside in his kennel.        But just as the taxi arrives and they step out of the house, the dog darts back inside the house and won't come back out. They don't want to leave the dog in the house, so the husband goes back in to get it, while the wife waits in the taxi.        Not wanting it known to all and sundry that the house will be empty, she explains to the driver that her husband had just popped back in 'to say good-bye to my mother'.       A few minutes later, a perspiring husband gets into the taxi.        'Sorry I took so long,' he says. 'The stupid b*tch was hiding under our bed and I had to poke her with a coat-hanger to get her to come out! Then I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from struggling as I carried her downstairs and tossed her into the back garden! And I'm telling you now - if she sh*ts in the garden again I will shoot her.       The taxi drivers face was a picture.
20090305093359AADSg4j	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Heard the one about the Businessman away from home?	A man checks into an hotel on a business trip and was a bit lonely. He thought of one of those girls you see advertised in phone booths when you're calling for a cab. He popped into a phone booth near the hotel and found an ad for a girl calling herself Erogonique, a lovely girl, bending over in the photo. She had all the right curves in all the right places, beautiful long wavy hair, long graceful legs...... well, you get the picture! He copied the phone number and returned to his hotel. When back in the room he figures, what the hell, give her a call.      'Hello,' the woman says. God, she sounded sexy.      'Hi, I hear you give a great massage and I'd like you to come to my room and give me one.. No, wait, I should be straight with you. I'm in town all alone and what I really want is s*x. I want it hard, I want it hot, and I want it now. Bring implements, toys, rubber, leather, whips, everything you've got in your bag of tricks. We'll go hot and heavy all night; tie me up, cover me in chocolate syrup and whipped cream, anything you want! Now, how does that sound?'      She says, 'That sounds fantastic, but you need to press 9 for an outside line'

20090305100547AAJaEfQ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	FUNNY OR NOT????? (GUYS & GIRLS.. PLz RATE IT)?	Diary of a Viagra Wife   Day 1.       Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he locked himself in the bathroom and cried.       Day 2.       Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he tell me something I don't know! I mean, he actually thinks I haven't noticed.       Day 3.       This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw a picture of the Washington Monument and burst into tears.       Day 4.       A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that will fix his problem. It's called Viagra. I told him that if he takes Viagra things will be just like they were on our wedding night. I think this will work. I replaced his Prozac with the Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.       Day 5.       What absolute bliss!!.       Day 6.       Isn't life wonderful but it's difficult to write while he's doing that.       Day 7.       This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended! Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. But, I have to admit it's very nice - I don't think I've ever been so happy.       Day 8.       I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed wacker. I'm also getting a bit sore down there.       Day 9.       No time to write. He might catch me.       Day 10.       Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down with whip cream and whisky! What am I going to do? I feel tacky all over....       Day 11.       I'm basically being scr￡wed to death. It's like living with a Black and Decker drill. I woke up this morning hot-glued to the bed. Even my armpits hurt. He's a complete pig.       Day 12.       I wish he was gay. I've stopped wearing make-up, cleaning my teeth or even washing but he still keeps coming after me! Even yawning has become dangerous ...       Day 13.       Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like going to bed with a scud missile. I can hardly walk and if he tries that "Oops, sorry", thing again, I'll kill the *******.       Day 14.       I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even started dressing like a nun but this just seems to make him h-o-r-n-i-e-r. Help me.       Day 15.       I think I'll have to kill him. The cat and dog won't go near him and our friends don't come over any more. Last night I told him to go and f... himself and he did.       Day 16.       The ******* has started to complain about headaches. I hope the bloody thing explodes. I did suggest he might try stopping the Viagra and going back on Prozac.       Day 17.       Switched the pills but it doesn't seem to have made any difference... Christ! Here he comes again!       Day 18.       He's back on Prozac. The lazy sod just sits there in front of the telly all day with that remote control in his hand and expects me to do everything for him. What absolute bliss!

So its leaders sent a message to the great white hunter, to come and kill the beast. For several nights the hunter lay in wait for the lion, but it never showed up. Finally, he told the tribal chief to k$ll a cow and give him its hide. Draping the skin over his shoulders, he went to the pasture to wait for the lion. In the middle of the night, the villagers woke to the sound of bl00dcurdling shrieks coming from the pasture. As they carefully approached, they saw the hunter lying there, groaning in pain. There was no sign of the lion.” What happened, bwana? Where is the lion? asked the chief.” Forget the d@mn lion!" he howled.” Which of you Idiots let the bull loose?"

20090305093257AAA2xv6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Syd Barrett: The most influential person on modern rock (indirectly of course)?	Now most of you will disagree, that is fine. Most people argue that artists/groups such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were most influential on rock. I disagree.      Now it is known that the Rolling Stones (and blues) were major influences on Pink Floyd's earlier music. If you listen to some unreleased tracks (circa 1965) such as "(I'm A) King Bee" and "Lucy Leave", this influence is obvious.       However, as we all know, music changed greatly for many reasons in the late 60's and early 70's. The rock and roll of the past, which was a little bada** for it's time, know seemed like squeaky clean what with the psychedelic, drug-induced melodies that came from this new era.       Pink Floyd were a major part of this transition. Syd Barrett became the poster boy of the psychedelic underground London scene. He was a magnificent song writer, and was the major composer for the Pink Floyd at the time. Pink Floyd quickly grew in fame throughout London, and then throughout England. EMI snatched up the group, and in 1968 they released they're first album "Pipers at the Gates of Dawn". Syd solely wrote 8, and co-wrote another 1 of the 11 songs on the album, and his style is heard throughout. Ask any Floyd fan, this album remains one of their best works.       Unfortunately, a mixture of too much LSD and being unable to handle the pressures of fame and fortune were too much for Syd. He became increasingly irratic. At times during live performances, he would strum only 2 notes during an entire set, or none at all. PF picked up Gilmour, played a few shows as a group of 5, but eventually simply stopped picking Syd up. He wrote a 3 solo albums which reflected his immense creativity even in such a mental state like he was in. Pink Floyd went on to build on the success that Syd had given them to become  one of the critically aclaimed, best selling bands of all time. (Gilmour has been quoted saying that he made sure Syd got his money over the years.) Syd spent the rest of his days as a recluse in Cambridge, keeping to himself and his family. He died of cancer in 2006.      So, to sum up this little preamble on the man, I will argue that he was the reason for Pink Floyd success. He started the band, wrote early material, and worked towards their early success. PATGOD was not just an unpopular, first shot album, it was highly influential to the music scene at the time, and was a best seller even in America. Syd had obvious influences on Pink Floyd's later material, as he plays subject to the concept album "Wish You Were Here", and in part in the later album "The Wall". I need not get into detail of post-Dark Side of the Moon PF, because we all know the music and it's influence, and how timeless it is.      And In this way, I think Syd is the most influential artist of all time. It deeply saddens me as to what happened to him. He left a grand legacy which was simply too much for him to handle.

It's a show on TLC called 17 Kids and Counting, and if you're even half way sane this show tends to piss you off beyond all recognition. These people have 17 DAMN kids and are EXTREMELY religious. Wayy over the top about it. They dont even believe in kissing until your married, so they had a chaperone go EVERYWHERE with their son and his fiancee before their wedding to make sure they.. didn't kiss???!!! They don't believe in halloween, and won't allow their kids to celebrate it.. Every normal thing that happens to go their way is an "act of God." Being this religious you would think that they wouldn't believe in birth control for obvious reasons, yet the wife miscarried a baby because she took it? I mean, I understand being religious but these people are RIDICULOUS. I can't believe some psychos like that are filthy friggin rich because americans watch their show. What do you guys think?

There he meets an Aussie farmer and gets talking. The Aussie shows off his big wheat field and the Texan says, "Oh! We have wheat fields that are at least twice as large."      Then they walk around the ranch a little, and the Aussie shows off his herd of cattle. The Texan immediately says, "We have longhorns that are at least twice as large as your cows."      The conversation has, meanwhile, almost died when the Texan sees a herd of kangaroos hopping through the field. He asks, "And what are those?"      The Aussie replies with an incredulous look, "Don't you have any grasshoppers in Texas?"          An Old Man      An old man went to the social security office to apply for benefits. When asked to show his birth certificate he stated that he didn't have one, so he removed his shirt and showed off his gray chest hair. With that the social security officer took him at his word and he was given a benefits check.      When the old man arrived home he told his wife what had happened. She promptly responded "You should have removed your pants and collected disability."

Before you answer, here's the facts:      According to annual health studies by the US and Canadian governments, the average age of girls' first intercourse in North America is 15 years and 4 months... for boys it's almost exactly 15 years... and these are both the oldest "first time" ages known since the mid-1950's more than half a century ago.

20090305093021AAoVS8X	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Piano grade 5? Help!?	I am taking my grade 5 piano in a week, after this grade I am quitting because I need to focus on my exams and I'm getting a bit fed up with it, so I hadn't been practicing that much, which I regret now as It's a week before the exam and I really do think I might fail! I am just struggling with my aural, my piano teacher isn't good with aural so he's signed me up to this website where I can practice my aural, and on the singing one, the tune is quite long and my memory isn't good enough to remember it! But I seem to remember in the other exams there was a break inbetween the tune that you have to sing so it's easier to remember, will there not be break inbetween the tunes for grade 5? If not i'll never remember! Also what is ritardando and accelerando? Any more tips on how to boost up my marks in the exam? I'm also rubbish at that aural test where you have to describe when the music was from or what type of music it is, can anyone help me one what time of music sounds like what and when it would of been from? any useful words for me to use? And also what are the different aural tests for grade 5? I want to make sure I've been practicing all of them! Thanks so much!

20090227063620AAHgN4U	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Now this is a really nice joke?	The sharing of marriage...      The old man placed order for one hamburger, French fries and a drink.       He unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half, placing one half in front of his wife.      He then carefully counted out the French fries, dividing them into two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife.       He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them .. As he began to eat his few bites of hamburger, the people around them were looking over and whispering.       Obviously they were thinking, 'That poor old couple - all they can afford is one meal for the two of them.'      As the man began to eat his fries a young man came to the table and politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple. The old man said, they were just fine - they always shared everything.       People closer to the table noticed the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink.       Again, the young man came over and begged them to let him buy another meal for them. This time the old woman said 'No, thank you, we are used to sharing everything.'      Finally, as the old man finished and was wiping his face neatly with the napkin, the young man again came over to the little old lady who had yet to eat a single bite of food and asked 'What is it you are waiting for?'       She answered      (Continue below - This is great)                      'THE TEETH.'

20090227070002AAuqZwP	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Can you help me name this movie please? I want to see it again but don't know the name!!!?	Okay so I missed the name of it at the beginning but saw most of the rest of it and it was so good, I'd love to see it again. It took place on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and centered around people getting attacked by a Great White Shark! The first to die was this girl who was skinny dipping at night, it was creepy! The police chief of the town took it upon himself to find a way to get rid of the shark, he hired a scientist and an expert fisherman/shark hunter, who was like a crusty old war veteran. The three of them went out on the shark hunter's boat and tried all sorts of things to stop the shark! I don't want to give away the ending because a lot of people might not have seen it yet, but it was cr-azy! If you have ever heard of something like this, please tell me! I want to show this to as many people as i can, it's one of those movies that everyone should know about! It was THAT good!! (Oh and one more thing that might help, some kind of tuba or orchestra music kept playing when the shark would attack people, it was cr-eepy! Please help! Thanks in advance!)
