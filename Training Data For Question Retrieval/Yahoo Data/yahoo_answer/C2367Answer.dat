yGOmMQP7aa	You probably indicated you did on your FAFSA application.  You do not have to take one out if you don't want to.  There is a question on there that asks that.  <br>  <br>  Some schools will automatically assume you want a loan if your grant money isn't enough to cover the entire cost of attendance at your school.  (NOTE: cost of attendance is more than just your tuition and books)  Either that or you did not qualify for any kind of grants and they want to help you in paying for it.  If you don't want to take out a loan, then don't turn in the papers, however, make sure you get enough grant money to pay your tuition.  Or if you don't qualify for any grant money, make sure you have the cash to pay so you can go.|`|gfOGZtmPaa	Your school may also be sending you loan paperwork for a Stafford or Perkins loan that you qualified for, based on your FAFSA.

This helps you to keep up with the class, makes it easier to study when it comes to tests or exams, or it helps when there's a surprise quiz the next day.  You can also learn for your own knowledge.  If you feel you're comfortable with the studying, then you know you've done enough.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	You gotta stay on top of your game!  Study all the time!!!

xwZV9jgPaa	I'm in northern KY and fast food is a no no here. A couple years ago we were in a catholic Cincinnati grade school and they decided to not allow parents to drop off fast food to kids anymore. It can't be because of the health issue. We just had school night at McDonald's last Thursday and I know that catholic school I sent my child to had McDonald's day and Taco Bell day. Think it's more the money issue, some kids parents can afford it so they don't want kids feeling bad when other children get it. Not sure where a school gets off telling me what i can and can not feed my child.

Put it this way; if you applied for a course, and another person did the same, and both of you had the same grades, but he/she did more activities, the uni will accept him/her.<br>  BUT, they aren't that important, only do them if you 1) have spare time and 2) you feel that your performance in class will not be effected.<br>  <br>  You can try volunteering, universities LOVE that.<br>  <br>  About you being shy, erm, it's only hard to make friends if you do not talk to people.

If they think the work will overwhelm you, if they think you'll have trouble living on your own, if they think you will drop out they won't accept you, because it costs them money. Activities serve the purpose of letting them learn more about you, yes, but rather than thinking "I need to do as many as possible" think about how they will benefit you as a person and help you gain maturity, think of the skills you pick up and how they will help you in university.<br>  And it is easy to make new friends, people say that you meet your best friends in uni - lots of common ground and interests because you're doing the same course, and everyone is in the same boat as you and will be looking for new friends. They have a fresher's week at the start, to give you all the chance to meet everyone and get used to the place :)

There are also MANY different kinds of intelligence.  One person who is a genius at spatial relationships might really suck at social relationships or vice versa.

Monroe's administration forewarned the imperial European powers against interfering in the affairs of the newly independent Latin American states or potential United States territories. While Americans generally objected to European colonies in the New World, they also desired to increase United States influence and trading ties throughout the region to their south. European mercantilism posed the greatest obstacle to economic expansion. In particular, Americans feared that Spain and France might reassert colonialism over the Latin American peoples who had just overthrown European rule. Signs that Russia was expanding its presence southward from Alaska toward the Oregon Territory were also disconcerting."|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	when, where, how?

I08iONdaaa	This is actually the first story that I've read on Y?A that remotely interested me, so good job! <br>  <br>  Few issues though: grammatically it seems a little off at parts. "and watch the ones you love die?" just sounds awkward, combine it with the previous sentence, if you want to pace it just use a "," instead. In the second paragraph you run into a lot of run-ons too. Maybe that's the effect you're going for, but it looks sloppy, so try to pace the story with complete sentences.  <br>  <br>  Also, i would pay closer attention to the narrative. There should be the voice of the narrator and the voice of your character. Remember, just because the story is in the first person doesn't mean that the narrator and your main character are the same. If you want your protagonist to take a life of his/her own, you need to allow them to disagree with the story's narrative, otherwise the story will just be a big plot summary. <br>  <br>  Hope that advice helps a little. And, seriously, props for writing something that intrigued me.|`|wrrKmlVuaa	the first paragraph is really really good then you kind of lose it ,it gets really simple you clarify it more in your second sometimes writing doesn't have to be simple and don't have to throw every little details at the readers..readers sometimes wants to think...keep them thinking.......other then that it's fine just do alot of revising...on it such as spelling check, and punctuation|`|7GcABTJ5aa	its alright. the beginning is good but then it just becomes so mangled and sounds like idk even know just a bunch of random thoughts thrown together.|`|lmtusbb7aa	Wow thats amazing! i wish i could write storeys as good as this!<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|mS1ODTalaa	you are trying to capture your reader by intruiging them to your story.  but it is over the top dramatic.  it begs the reader to ask what, instead of flowing more naturally. there are many spelling errors but thats not really the point.   i liked the idea very much but try to be more subtle.  <br>  <br>  this writing assumes your reader is to stupid to realize that something has gone terribly wrong.  you drill it over and over.  trust me they will get the point.

oms6L2vkaa	First off sports teams don't hire their own personal orthopedic surgeons, they just tend to use the best ones they can find. Second, I've never heard of someone doubling as a surgeon and trainer, If you are gonna take the time to become a surgeon why go through extra training to become a trainer, who earns significantly less.<br>  <br>  As for the schooling, undergrad(4 years  for most people), Med school (4 years), residency for surgery (generally 5-6 years), fellowship for orthopedic surgery( 1-2 years). <br>  <br>  A fellowship is what you go into after your residence to receive a more specific training.

DBdR26Ssaa	A while back i was doing a STINT in rehab. The story is quite INTRICATE so i will give you the scaled down version. First of all the INSOLENCE of the officer that pulled me over was crazy. I mean so i was doing a little drinking and driving. Who hasnt right? So I went into this HARANGUE about how he was being completely unreasonable. He said that i needed to RELINQUISH my keys immediately. I told him no way, it was my car and my baby dad bought it for me and i wasnt giving my keys to no po-po. Well eventually i started feeling quite CONTRITE, and i agreed to give him my keys. He read me my rights then took me down to the station. When i got there they locked me up and then they made me go to rehab since it was not my first offense. Well the BLASPHEME that came from the courts to the rehab about me really pissed me off, and they said that they would be ASSESSING me for the first few days there to see how i was. Without my drank i started EVOKING all kinds of crazy hallucinations and stuff, but they said that was normal. They just said that if i prayed eventually the INSURRECTION would help, bbut the beatings were UNABATED and it was tough to get though them. There was one RESOLUTELY nurse there who seemed to walk UNDULATED,  and sometimes i miss her. So inconclusion.

ec7faabfad01fb70cf9da66d5b00110caa	There are some negative effects. One could argue that a culture built on formative assessments will create weaker leaders. There is something to be said in giving a class an assignment and letting the clever pass and the slower ones fail. It builds a sense of pressure to understand on the first go-round exactly what is wanted, and it rewards those who got it by punishing those who didn't. Remember in sociological groups, we are more defined by who we're not than who we are. Formative assessments erase those important lines. Not nearly as clever children can just as easily define themselves a high achieve through dedicated and repeated work, which though it may be great for them, it dilutes the personal satisfaction for those who would have been the top performers on set, strict summative assessments. And in the end, this can create a culture that finds mistakes ok. <br>  <br>  Its funny how we value formative assessments for our children, and even ourselves, but how little we'd be amused if our doctor did a surgery he didn't quite understand on us so that he could understands it much better on someone else.

dab47577283a37a55ea29d50e0ddbb45aa	i went to a community college and got an AS in general studies. for you, it sounds like it would be a great path to take. a community college will give you experience in college with out overwhelming you with allot of the crap that goes on in a 4 year school. you can better focus on your education while you are there. also it will look great when you transfer to a 4 year school. another up side it it's cheaper then a 4 year school and all of your general education requirement will be done with by the time you transfer.<br>  <br>  also, NEVER let any one tell you what you can or cant do. your teacher is not you, he doesn't know what you are truly capable of. he might be able to give you advice but do what you want to do. in the end, life is all about you and what you do. so do what you want to do and don't let him try to crush your dreams.|`|2nqmoerIaa	it can be but some people like ot some dont ask ur teacher about it she can help u understand|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Think it's an excellent choice realizing the cost of going to college and in two years not only end up with a degree, AAS, but a skill, trade, or profession as well and if you want to go on to a four year college your can transfer allot of your credits from your community college - just remember you must do well in your courses, A's and some B's, so you can transfer them.  Went to a community college my self would give it a high rating than allot of four year colleges.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	Yes its actually better to start out with a community college than to start of with a state university. For one if you decide that college is not for you you only spend a couple hundred on the community college where you would have spend thousands at a state college. Also you can still live from home if a community college is close enough. I would suggest going to anyone.|`|kTZevQNHaa	yes especially since there's high demand for trades people...even consider a trades school in lieu of either university OR college..plumbers, glaziers, electricians, construction, aircraft repair, mechanics=all in HIGH demand and VERY well paying jobs there days...and here's good news...many places will PAY you to get your apprenticeship--paying YOu to train you...consider that...do some research and you will see...many more employment opprotunities these days than with what's awarded with many universtity degrees.

Being better than someone in anything can create stress, doing well on test or in classes, and just the normal social aspect of a teens life is stressful. Friends are probably the least you should worry about or make it seem like it's really stressful.

You've hit the nail on the head with the social aspect. Although schools are institutions for learning, they also allow you to meet new friends, attend/participate in athletics and clubs, attend dances, etc. I would hate for anyone who is a social person to miss out on these wonderful experiences!
a3906a15682d2ea1f447780889cfbb8faa	Intelligence and memory work in different ways in different people. Some people are more visual, others, oral (speaking), aural (hearing), even kinetic (movement - this sounds like a strong component in your case), and of course different combinations and variants (e.g. some people remember better by 'hearing' their own voice, and others by 'hearing' someone else's voice). They are all valid. If you are aware of your "style" you can enhance your results by favoring compatible learning methods, rather than beating yourself up about not doing things 'like everybody else'.|`|MINy26pjaa	That happens to a lot of people.

UxooffHZaa	Pagan Rome was Rome under it's gods. (Minerva, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, the Fates, Terminus, etc) Pagan Rome grew to be the most powerful empire of it's day. <br>  Christian Rome saw it's decline. First the Roman military accepted Jesus as their warrior God (I'm not sure how this worked, but this is how Jesus was viewed by the Roman militia), and because of the power of the armies, eventually spread to the nobility. Because a large and varied people didn't want to be ruled over one foreign deity, (Jesus) they began revolting, starting on the edges of the empire, in places like modern Germany, Spain, France, and North Africa. Then, the Roman Empire split into two seperate Christian factions, then finally collapsed. <br>  Pagan Rome accepted a God or two from every culture it conquered, so the conquered people felt a part of Rome. (Epona and Isis, who were Celtic and Egyptian respectively, got as much worship as the Roman Venus or Mars) <br>  Christian Rome made everyone conform their religion to the Roman Catholic standard. The varied people of Europe, Asia and Africa did not accept this conformity, so Christian Rome saw Rome's decline.

otAH6brTaa	Schools offer free tutors through students that want to appeal to colleges, so you have some competition.  I wanted to tutor at my school to prepare for becoming a teacher, but they said I had to be a Junior or Senior.

IFL3GcM9aa	Do you understand why you did so badly on the more recent exams?  Do you have reason to believe you would do very very well on the rest?<br>  <br>  Your teacher understands the subject matter, and understands what it takes to do well. You didn't just do sorta badly on those two exams, you did really badly.  If you need that information to understand upcoming material, you are sunk.<br>  <br>  BUT, you can still pull it through if you understand what went wrong with the last two tests well enough to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Your teacher may be just trying to give you a reality check - you can't goof up again if you want to pass. If you have it in you to pass, you won't be discouraged by this.<br>  <br>  (One other consideration: is this a college course?  If so, your teacher may be urging you to drop out while you can get your money back.  Watch for drop deadlines.)

NQq8i7gsaa	if hes not getting good grades then it's a good idea to re-do the year so that he can have a better GPA so that he can get into a better college if he wants, but if thats not the case and it seems to be so in your case, i see no reason why he shouldnt redo it because why would you want to try and advance to the next grade without understanding the curiculum and then have the possibilty of having trouble in the next grade, causing problems in the future.|`|1RWdip75aa	No<br>  <br>  Unless he's trying to get into an extremely competitive school or something.<br>  <br>  because high school is a waste as it is.. why stay there longer then you have to?

NvsFhD7Laa	Because in the old days, the first person to create a trail through a forest would leave blaze marks on the trees where the path would later be formed.  They were quite literally, trail blazers.<br>  <br>  Often these people were the first ones to set foot in that area of the wilderness, and they would have to be tough, smart, and well prepared for the unexpected.<br>  <br>  Over time, the phrase caught hold of people doing new things in all different areas or fields, i.e. they were the 'trailblazers' of their specific area.<br>  <br>  Louis Pasteur, for example, was a trailblazer of modern medicine when he invented the vaccine.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Trailblazers usually refer to someone who sets a "path" or "field" for others to follow. For example, Albert Einstein was a trailblazer who set the bar for all who followed him to never give up if inventing something. Einstein "led the scientifically minded" in that field of work to follow.<br>  <br>  The most famous trailblazer in history in my opinion, is Jesus Christ. He led the way for millions upon millions of people to live by His example. It seems to have worked - many people live their life today the way Jesus taught people to over 2,000 years ago.|`|MINy26pjaa	In the old days, like with wagon trains and such, someone would be sent ahead of the caravan to find the best trail.  This person would mark the trees along the trail with notches, paint, or chipping away some of the bark.  Then the rest of the caravan could find the best way by following the marks.  These marks were called blazes.  So the person who went ahead of everyone else and marked the trail for the followers was called a trailblazer.  Now, it has come to mean anyone who leads others in new things.|`|b0qKOoBRaa	Because they lead the way.  It generally implies that they are far ahead of the rest.  Hence the "blaze" part.  They're on fire... ya know what I mean?<br>  <br>  There are different "stories" (actually, they're myths) as to where this term came from and why.  Such as burning paths through the wilderness or leaving burns to mark your trail, but the truth is, no one really the exact etymology of the term.  <br>  <br>  However, I've had teachers who subscribe to stories like this and want their students to believe (or at least remember) them, so if you're expected to know for an assignment, you better ask your teacher or a classmate what they are looking for you to know.<br>  <br>  But if you just need to know the meaning of the term, maybe some synonyms will help you solidify the meaning: innovators, leaders, pioneers, trendsetters, groundbreakers, bushwhackers (this one's VERY similar).

n3URcEeYaa	Use the funnel method instead of the anti-funnel method.  By that I mean start from vague and go to specific, not the way that it is up there.  Start by talking about betrayal and what it means, and then talk about Hamlet.  Just get rid of the first sentence, and put the sentence "William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' (underline it, as it is a large work) portrays betrayal, etc." after what you have.  Talk briefly about the ways characters betray or are betrayed (these examples will drive your body paragraphs) and you'll be solid.<br>  <br>  You can use what you have already, but I'd recommend some revision.  Firstly, the syntax (wording) is a little awkward.  I'd keep the content, but reword it.  The phrasing of the definition of betrayal is poorly composed, so it doesn't make much sense.  If you took it from a dictionary it has to be cited, so try to come up with your own.  Also, don't start a sentence with "but" (Instead of "But betrayal isn't just that", say "However, betrayal is more than just that")<br>  <br>  PS. Not that it's any of my business, but I wouldn't use that line about "a river that runs red with revenge".  It's a little cheesy... :P

9oiZ6Rmbaa	Rotovirus (or Rotavirus) is a common viral infection among young children. It is the most common cause of diarrhea in U.S. children and is a leading cause of death among children in developing countries. The virus works by attacking the lining of the small intestine, causing often copious loss of fluids and electrolytes. The virus is spread through oral contact to fecal material, and is common in child care environments.

Good luck  Also, in regard to above post, as a psychologist, PhD or not, you are not able to prescribe RX.  That is part of the job duties of a Psychaiatrist....who on top of his/her B.S. premed, goes to a full term of med school, gets an MD and then specializes in Psychiatry.   That is for sure, ten to eleven years after HS.  The PhD in the psychologist version....true you can hold the title at a masters degree, you can counsel for sure, but most private practitioners in psychology, get that PhD to be competetive...you really need it for what you want to do

cyctEPjSaa	Does both Harry and Annabel know what the other put in the box? If not, that could be an interesting twist in the end (one finds out what it was).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I always find that a good way to end a story is to kill off one of the main characters (sad, but true). It adds an unexpected turn of events. So, lets say that Harry dares Annabel to do something that's not exactly safe (i.e. swim across the lake or climb to the top of a building in the rain), and Annabel ends up dying. As a result, Harry becomes extremely protective of the box, and doesn't want to talk to anyone because his memory is so scarred. However, when he finally decides to open up the box one day, he realizes what she put in it, and it could be something like a note she wrote to him (something like "If you're reading this, something terrible must have happened to me, since we promised never to look inside. I'm sorry. But also, if you're reading this, that means you haven't forgotten me. Thanks for that. But then again, I know you. And I know you don't let things go easily (like playing tricks). So I need you to do something for me - I need you to let me go. I know it's hard, but you have to. Please. For me. Love, Annabel") You could end it there with a cliffhanger, or take it a bit further and show him finally coming out of his shell and showing his true self, not the trickster he used to be or the sweet kid he became, but rather the real Harry.

To find the median of a number, order all the numbers (in the data set) from lowest to greatest, then pick the middle number, if there are two numbers in the middle, then find the number that is halfway between those two. The mode is the most occurring number in a data set, so the number you see the most. The median is the hardest to do out of all three, to find the mean of find the sum of all the values (add all the numbers up), then divide by the number of values (divide the sum you just got by how many numbers you see). If you need to remember what each one is on a test: the mean is the mean one where you have to do all the adding and dividing, the median is like the medium or middle number, and the mode is the popular one because it's the odd one out that no one ever remembers!

I would never do it but there are lots of people who have confided the world in me - in a matter of minutes -once meeting me.<br>  <br>  We live in a very  open society - probably due to reality TV , Oprah and Ricky Lake etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  People are now willing to tell a whole lot more than they used to - if you watch TV you see people do it all the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  So if you want to do this go  ahead.  People do this to counsellors, therapists, priests, doctors, reporters, tv producers, presenters , psychologists and psychiatrists all the time. <br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone has a right to be heard as if they aren't they don't really exist outside their own mind. I don't advocate sharing your problems with all and sundry like the Rickie Lake show, but people who are constructive and can give you tangible advice are fine.|`|fOfg1SoOaa	sure<br>  <br>  whats wrong?|`|dImvoGLVaa	Jesus will listen to all your problems and will even make you feel like a load has been lifted off your shoulders.

Go to an alter call if you want your life changed. That might not be the moment of your life but if you start following the path God leads for you, you will feel SO much better. You'll be happy. =) I know I am, and everyone can tell.

RuimqHavaa	What is terrorism? What does it involve? Who does it involve? In my mind, terrorism is, "evil, horror, and violence. It is the cruelty of killing mass numbers of people for illogical reasons." The Encyclopedia of Britannica describes terrorism as, "the systematic use of terror or unpredictable violence against governments, publics, or individuals, to attain a political objective." The FBI further describes it as either being, "domestic or international terrorism; domestic terrorism being the illegal or threatened use of violence within the United-states or without foreign direction in furtherance of political or social objectives; and international terrorism being violent acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United-States, or any state." Clear, precise, and factual; yes. But emotionally correct, no. <br>  <br>  Terrorism has struck all through history and around the world. Even in ancient Roman times, emperors such as Tiberius and Caligula dealt with terrorism by using banishment, and execution towards those who opposed their rule. Later in the 1860's a terrorist group called the Ku Klux Klan was formed by Southerners to terrify former slaves and prevent them from voting or run for office. In the 19th century, Western Europeans, Russians, and Americans adopted terrorism, and believed that the best way to get what they wanted was to assassinate people holding high positions of power. <br>  <br>  In the 20th century, terrorism went through some great changes. The use of new technology such as automatic weapons and electrically bursting explosives encouraged terrorists to act violently and provided them with an easier way of attacking. At the time, attacks were mainly from groups trying to undermine or overthrow existing political institutions. However, today terrorism exists with different causes and purposes in mind. It has been used in anti-colonial conflicts such as in Ireland, Britain, Algeria and France. It is used when settling conflicts between different groups in possession of homeland such as Palestine & Israel. It is also used in religious disagreements in the case of the Catholics & Protestants in Northern Ireland and in internal conflicts between revolutionary forces and established governments, for example: Malaysia, Argentina, Iran, and Nicaragua. <br>  <br>  Terrorism went from numerous attacks in the 20th century, to less frequent but more destructive assaults in the 21st century. The threat of terrorism has now become more deadly. But the Americans soldiers, the freedom fighters as some people call them are fighting back with no mercy. As Herr expresses in his book, "the battle grew into the bloodiest of the spring", "4,000 had been killed... it was another American victory." Over the past couple years; terrorists have developed new tactics such as portable bombs, suicide operatives, and weapons of mass destruction. These have been known to result in hundreds, not to say thousands of people being injured or killed. Some people even become terrorist, or are forced into terrorizing for reasons that they do not even know. As Michael Herr mentions, "Every day people were dying because of some small detail that they couldn't be bothered to observe." Take September 11 2001 into consideration, when two airplanes were hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center and another into the pentagon. In just two hours, families were torn apart, courage was tested, and the world was shaken forever. The hijackers had probably believed that they were dying on that plane for their country, but sadly did not know the true and exact reason for their presence, or their life for that matter. At the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton said, "I visited Ground Zero right after we were attacked. I felt like I was standing at the Gates of Hell. I hope no American ever has to witness a sight like that again."|`|p4szdxrCaa	Tell about how bad it is and how it affects the world, econemy, and people.|`|jgDaMazWaa	Well, you could talk about the history of terrorism, terrorism today, the motives of a terrorist, or something like that.

RuimqHavaa	Nelson Glueck, who carried out archaeological research in the area east of the Jordan during the thirties, in 1940 published a book entitled 'The other side of the Jordan'. In this book he concluded that the kingdoms of Sihon and Og could not have existed before the end of the 13th century B.C., because between c. 1900 and 1250 B.C. the region was not urbanized, but inhabited by semi-nomadic people in small numbers. According to Glueck, these nomads lived in tents, wandered about, and did not use durable pottery, but perishable hides to store their supplies. This hypothesis, which turned out later to be entirely incorrect, has led many people to abandon dating the Exodus in the 15th century B.C. and instead adopt the late dating.<br>  <br>  The results of Glueck's archaeological work, which was carried out from 1933 through 1938, were published first in the years 1934-1951.1 In 1970 a revised edition of his book was published, in which Glueck to some extent weakened his statements about this inhabitative vacuum. He admitted that a few cities did exist in some parts of the area during Middle Bronze II (c. 1875-1470 B.C.) and Late Bronze (c. 1470-1200 B.C.): <br>  <br>  "In much of Transjordan, especially in the areas some distance south of the south side of the Wadi Zerqa (Biblical River Jabboq), the Middle Bronze I period of the Age of Abraham seems to have been followed by a considerable decline in sedentary settlement during the Middle Bronze II and Late Bronze I-II periods, although not as radically as we had once assumed." "It is possible, of course, that further excavations will yet reveal Middle Bronze II and Late Bronze occupancy there, as we never gave up believing would be the case in all of central and southern Transjordan."<br>  <br>  Glueck also mentioned the discovery of a tomb from the Late Bronze period in Madeba and Late Bronze pottery in Jalul, at about 5 km east of Madeba, and in other places.2<br>  <br>  In 1971 Prof. Dr. H.J. Franken sharply criticized Glueck's position. Franken conducted excavations in Deir 'Alla, in the Jordan valley, which proved to have been inhabited throughout the Late Bronze period. He argued that Glueck had dated some specific pottery to the Iron period, whereas it could equally have been dated to the 14th century B.C.3<br>  <br>  It may be pointed out here that the Amarna letters (c.1360-1335) make reference to the cities of Pella, Astaroth, Bozrah, and Kenath, all lying in Bashan country, and also to Zaphon which lies south of Pella in the Jordan Valley. This in itself should have made it clear that Glueck's hypothesis was incorrect.<br>  <br>  EXCAVATIONS EAST OF THE JORDAN<br>  <br>  Recent excavations in the area east of the Jordan have produced results that refute Glueck's argument completely. The investigation included a number of new sites. Both northern and central Transjordan yielded evidence of Late Bronze habitation in a number of big cities, where Amman, Sahab, Tell- Safut, Tell el-Husu (Pella), Tell Irbid, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (probably Zarethan), Tabaqat Fahl, and Tell el-Mazar are located today. The archaeological finds showed that these Transjordan settlements shared their cultural characteristics with Palestine and Phenician cities from the same period.4<br>  <br>  Elaborate excavations in Tell el-Husu (Pella) showed that this city (in the past named Pehel) existed both in Late Bronze I (1470-1400 B.C.) and in Late Bronze II (1400-1200 B.C.).5 Late Bronze graves were found in Amman, Irbid, Pella, and Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, and large quantities of Late Bronze pottery were found in many places in the Transjordan area.6<br>  <br>  Archaeologist R. Dornemann, an expert in Transjordan archaeology, not surprisingly concludes that the archaeological research carried out since Glueck's publications has proved beyond doubt that urban civilisation existed throughout the Middle and Late Bronze periods, although the number of cities may have decreased after the Early Bronze period.7<br>  <br>  The large quantities of pottery found - which include Mycenaean and Cypriot pottery characteristic of Late Bronze, and scarabs from the same period - make it impossible to deny that cities existed in the Transjordan area during the entire Late Bronze period.<br>  <br>  Glueck's conclusion even proved to be incorrect for a number of sites investigated by himself.8 In an archaeological survey between 1963 and 1966, 18 Middle Bronze II cities and almost as many from the Late Bronze period were discovered. Middle or Late Bronze pottery has up till now been excavated at c. 200 Transjordan locations.9<br>  <br>  HESHBON<br>  <br>  There is still much uncertainty about the precise locations of the cities that are mentioned in Numbers 32 and Deuteronomy 3.<br>  <br>  Former cities sometimes were not located in the places that later carried their names. Heshbon, king Sihon's capital (Nu.21:26 and Dt.1:4) is such a city. Excavations have been carried out in Tell Heshban, identified as the city of Heshbon during the reign of king Mesha of Moab (c. 850 B.C.). However, no material dating from befo

AA10393340	As we progress from infancy into childhood we meet one of the most important stages of our development. This is the time when our brain's learning process really goes into overdrive. Remember that in a few short years from birth to starting school, we have learned how to speak a language, developed social skills and behavioral patterns and started to recognise the pattern of life.<br>  <br>  So then, what is the next step? Obviously the learning process needs to be nurtured and fostered. It would be wasteful and irresponsible not to encourage it at this key time. The answer therefore is simple. It is 'Education'. In the developed world, education is readily available, in fact it is a legal requirement that we be given it, and it is mandatory to attend the schools and colleges that are provided for that purpose.<br>  <br>  The basis of any school is the provision of a sound, basic and thorough groundwork into a wide but deep variety of subjects. These can be divided into separate sectors comprising of core subjects, (those thought to be essential for all walks of life and employment opportunities), vocational subjects, (those required for a particular type of employment) , and recreational subjects, (these last ones being for aesthetic or pleasurable purposes).<br>  <br>  Sadly there is limited time available for teachers to teach and pupils to learn. The timetable of life dictates that we preserve the momentum of servile adherence to protocol and ridgidity in timekeeping. The dictat is such that we become educated within the parameters of set timescales that, generally, commence at nine o'clock in the morning, include breaks for resting our brains between subjects, and others so that we can eat, culminating in the cessation of the educational process around three thirty in the afternoon.<br>  <br>  There, then, is the problem. The solution is simple. Education can be likened to a bottomless pit of knowledge, available to all, provided we stick to the enforcement of a timetable. So, what is the solution? Easy. It's 'Homework'. Here we have a vast source of time available to continue the educational learning curve that is so fertile in the young mind, Age dulls the perception and ability of absorption of knowledge, so it is important in the extreme to grasp the opportunity whilst it exists and is available. One must forget the drudgery of, seemingly, enforced labour and, instead, welcome the chance to enhance the store of knowledge and skill that can be augmented by generating extra curriculum activity, and thus set one's store for the future. It would be unwise and churlish to scorn such an offer, so it must be grabbed with both hands while it is there.<br>  <br>  So, bring on the homework. Let it improve our learning capability, extend the knowledge, increase the flow of blood to the brain cells and, ultimately, benefit the young as they grow into adulthood and join in the surge of economic activity that is named 'Employment'. It benefits the individual, the community, the country and the very world we live in to do so.<br>  <br>  To finish, it would be wise to remember the choices there are. Do the homework and prosper, or ignore it and move in the opposite direction. Here is the choice. Grow up to be educated, able to earn and pay your way in the modern and future world, be free to enjoy the pleasures that life provides both physical and mental. Travel and see the world, marvelling in the wonders it holds, and meet and converse with people from all over the globe in peaceful harmony. That is choice one. Choice two is stark reality. Ignore the homework, and with it the benefits of choice number one. Grow up to be seen as dumb and uninteresting. Struggle to find gainful employment, and live your life scraping by on benefit or welfare. Lose the friends that you once had as they enjoy the riches of the use of the education they have gained, and no longer need to associate with people like you, and envy them of their riches and social advantage. Struggle to participate in the njoyment of literature, art and music because yu don't understand any of it.<br>  <br>  I know which my choice would be given that situation. Bring on the homework. Pile it high, and let me use it well and, one day, when I am enjoying life to the full, I can look back and be thankful that I was given the chance to develop my talents and use them in a constructive, worthwhile and profitable way.|`|86DNwJESaa	its important because it prepares you for the real world of life.. <br>  <br>  if you do it, you won't fail and you will graduate hs and hopefully get into a good college and be prepared for college classes.. and   you could get great scholarships  so you have a promising future|`|eOdcZvQjaa	it helps you to remember what you learned in school.is when you actually put what you learned to use.|`|jIM4HpUGaa	Homework is important because it helps students to practice and better their skills in specific areas. You get a heck of a lot of marks just for doing the suff which can sometimes change an entire grade level. You are prepped for tests so you paractically know the stuff inside out. You can review and study your work at your own pace. It builds responsible behavior necessary such as meeting deadlines, and to avoid procrastination, which in my opinion is a major life skill. Homework is good because it is work that you do at home, no really, if kids didn't have a lot of homework to do they would eventually get very bored sitting at home all that time. Without homework teachers, would have nothing to mark in their spare time (not sure if that one is good or bad). When doing work at home kids don't usually feel as pressured to get the right answer, they have a clear mind that they can do their best (at least some of them do). It's been a tradition for the past couple of centuries, so why bother changing it now? All in all homework is here, and it probably won't be going out the window any time soon (unless you plan on feeding it to your dog), might as well just go with the flow and try your best! Hope that helps...(:|`|FmvnC8keaa	Homework is important because..<br>  <br>  *It helps prepare you for tests<br>  *Helps you to remember material gone over and get better at it<br>  *Gives you chances to raise your grade by just completing it for points?

SlzeWUsjaa	Extraterrestrial life is defined as life which does not originate from Earth. It is the subject of astrobiology and its existence remains hypothetical, because there is no credible evidence of extraterrestrial life which has been generally accepted by the mainstream scientific community. Hypotheses regarding the origin(s) of extraterrestrial life, if it indeed exists, are as follows: one proposes that it may have emerged, independently, from different places in the universe. An alternative hypothesis is panspermia, which holds that life emerges from one location, then spreads between habitable planets. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The study and theorization of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology, exobiology or xenobiology. Speculated forms of extraterrestrial life range from sapient or sentient beings, to life at the scale of bacteria.|`|AA11185479	You're not asking for help, you're asking for someone to do the work for you.

sXAPuQ2uaa	I am not sure about where this question stems from, but I will give you the answer from a computer science background.<br>  <br>  In order to process information, we obviously need an input to know what we are dealing with. i.e. -> Name, numbers, etc.<br>  <br>  Processing is also a required step.  Code must use the "input" to process the information required.<br>  <br>  User interaction isn't completely necessary, as information can be run through a script.  However, how would you start the script if a user doesn't plug in the machine, or press enter, etc.<br>  <br>  Output is not necessary for processing.  After all, it is the final outcome is it not?  So in a literal sense, the "processing" is done by the time needed for output.  Also, you could just end your code after the processing, and never show the answers.

When the bases are the same in this case 10 are the bases you just add the exponents. The exponents here are 3 and -4. So 3+-4=-1. 10^-1=1/10 since when the exponent is negative it is equal to 1/x^y where x is the base and y is the exponent.

yJSPecgoaa	Because of curriculum requirements dictated by the state and local district, one doesn't really have the luxury of "majoring" in a subject area in high school.  Choosing a major generally happens at the college level.<br>  <br>  However, if your high school offers an elective in Psychology (in our local high school, such a course is offered by the Social Studies Dept.), by all means try to take it.<br>  <br>  When you go to college, you can choose a major.  Some colleges offer undergrad majors in social work, which would be a good choice for you.  Otherwise, you could choose Psychology as a major in preparation for later getting a Masters in Social Work.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Your high school curriculum won't have much to do with your plans to be an investigator for Child Protective Services.

sXAPuQ2uaa	In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens. Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide. Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud. For the next two hours, we will watch the story of their doomed love and their parents' anger, which nothing but the children's deaths could stop. If you listen to us patiently, we'll make up for everything we've left out in this prologue onstage.

WkcYzNjSaa	CLAIM:<br>  A claim is a statement that the arguer presents; the point the arguer wants to make. Other terms for claim are “assertion,” proposition,” “conclusion,” and “thesis.”<br>  The Nature of Claims:<br>  Different types of claims require different kinds of proof. e.g., DNA evidence can establish whether a man is the biological father of a child (fact), but not whether he was a “good” or “bad” father (value). e.g., example: Two people might agree the urban crime rate has been declining in the U.S. (fact), while disagreeing about the need for tougher criminal penalties (policy).<br>  · A clearly stated claim reveals relevant issues: Issues that are relevant to one type of claim may be irrelevant to another. <br>  <br>  EVIDENCE:<br>  Evidence serves as support for the reasons you offer and helps compel audiences to accept your claims. Evidence comes in different sorts, and it tends to vary from one academic field or subject of argument to another. Evidence answers challenges to the reasons you give, and it comes in three main types:<br>  -Specific instances<br>  -Statistics<br>  -Testimony<br>  <br>  REASONING:<br>  Reasons are statements of support for claims, making those claims something more than mere assertions. Reasons are statements in an argument that pass two tests:<br>  -Reasons are answers to the hypothetical challenge to your claim<br>  -Reasons can be linked to claims with the word because<br>  <br>  <br>  IN SUMMARY:<br>  Claim: What happened, and why did it happen?

Like, they'll say "PLEASE READ!!!" and you have to click on them to see what the question is (although, maybe that's a good technique to get people to click on it).

Now, looking at this situation, no one is unique, everyone is the same. We would all have the same personality and essentially be copies of each other.

When I say this I mean people who misunderstood a math concept, or need a guideline on how their going to write an essay. Even "catchy titles" I can understand, just so long as they learn what they need to after they ask, so they can apply it later. That is also why when answering on "Homework Help" you must explain your answer with great detail, which some people don't do, so really all they did was do somebody elses homework, instead of helping them. Sometimes, people ask others to "write an essay for me please!", but what good does that do? Experience is everything, the point of doing homework is so that you do more of the work, so you understand it fully when you need it later in life. When people get other people to do their homework, they didn't gain anything, did they, now they probably still don't understand for hat big test, or when it's time to get a job, or even applying it in life!<br>  <br>  Just wanted you, and everyone else on this "Homework Help" thing to know!<br>  <br>  By the way, if this was an assignment you had to do for school, hopefully you realize that if you copy this, you gained nothing.

If you want to better your grammar, spelling, vocabulary, math, etc etc, ad nauseum, look into homeschool. It won't be easier, but you'll be better for it.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Where did broken19 obtain her information from? She is wrong on all sides of the spectrum.<br>  Homeschooling depends on the homeschooler and the parents who are teaching. My son has days where it will take him about 5 hours to complete his school day as opposed to other days where it would take him 3. It is a go at your own pace so to speak. You decide when you want to work and you decide when you want lunch or when you want a break. That's the good side of it.<br>  My son usually likes to get everything done before 12 so he has the whole day to himself to do what he pleases. (He's 17 btw)<br>  As far as it being easier. In my son's opinion, yes it is. For others, no. It all depends, on what I said earlier, on the homeschooler and the person(s) teaching him.|`|3J9Px74Naa	No Way!! I'm being home-schooled!! If you do the work - and it can also depend what type of school-work you do - like you should do.It's really hard. Try doing "Rod & Staff or Bob jones University or Abeka.

It was not bad for me, I hated english so my parent let me focus on math which was cool.

But the work is more enjoyable, and there is a learn-at-your-own-pace environment, and more relaxed. That'll seem to make the work easier.
Sj74XGh4aa	Utilitarians are basically people who believe that the most important thing (ethically speaking) is to do whatever promotes the highest amount of happiness.|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	In the notion of consequences the Utilitarian includes all of the good and bad produced by the act, whether arising after the act has been performed or during its performance. If the difference in the consequences of alternative acts is not great, some Utilitarians do not regard the choice between them as a moral issue. According to Mill, acts should be classified as morally right or wrong only if the consequences are of such significance that a person would wish to see the agent compelled, not merely persuaded and exhorted, to act in the preferred manner.<br>  <br>  In assessing the consequences of actions, Utilitarianism relies upon some theory of intrinsic value: something is held to be good in itself, apart from further consequences, and all other values are believed to derive their worth from their relation to this intrinsic good as a means to an end. Bentham and Mill were hedonists; i.e., they analyzed happiness as a balance of pleasure over pain and believed that these feelings alone are of intrinsic value and disvalue. Utilitarians also assume that it is possible to compare the intrinsic values produced by two alternative actions and to estimate which would have better consequences. Bentham believed that a hedonic calculus is theoretically possible. A moralist, he maintained, could sum up the units of pleasure and the units of pain for everyone likely to be affected, immediately and in the future, and could take the balance as a measure of the overall good or evil tendency of an action. Such precise measurement as Bentham envisioned is perhaps not essential, but it is nonetheless necessary for the Utilitarian to make some interpersonal comparisons of the values of the effects of alternative courses of action.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	Utilitarian value of an item is the value you can actually apply and use in everyday life.  So, a painting has aesthetic value but not utilitarian value until you find out that you can pay off your mortgage with it.  A broken bench might not have any utilitarian value to you, but your next door neighbor who has a fireplace will find it perfect for kindling, so to him that broken bench will have utilitarian value.  For example, during Depression era flour was sold in cotton sacks that often had pretty prints on them.  To someone who could sew these became invaluable in their utility, since they could be turned into clothes, and when they wore out the good parts could be used for quilting or braiding a rug, while the leftovers served perfectly well for a rag mop.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	The values of something by its usefulness rather than its intrinsic value.<br>  Poor people don't need gold but they need medical care.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Utilitarians believe that you should make every moral choice by picking the option which causes the greatest amount of happiness. So they're completely selfless, because their happiness isn't any more important than anyone else's. But then there's also the problem that it could lead to what we'd generally see as immoral acts e.g. they don't take into consideration a person dying, because dead people can't be happy/unhappy, so if people murdered someone and took pleasure in it, and the victim didn't have any friends or family to be upset by it, that would be the 'right' thing to do according to utilitarianism.

dcf22abaabe712c7c6abd9464ff58ab2aa	Yes.  If a student's family's financial situation is poor, then the student may not be able to afford the laptops, internet service, top of the line calculators, a tutor, and other materialistic items that money buys.  On top of that, they could be missing out on other things, such as a parent who is home to help with homework (since the parent could be working multiple jobs to support the family).  Maybe the student is a teen who is tasked with babysitting the younger siblings because the family can't afford a babysitter (so the student has less uninterrupted time to do their homework).  Maybe the teen has to work to help support the family and has less time for homework or <br>  <br>  If the home situation is chaotic, then the student may get distracted when trying to complete their homework.  Maybe the student is so worried about what is going on in their home life that they can't concentrate during class.|`|RxjjDSkFaa	I think it does because I am in a situation like that<br>  My parents have a bad financial AND home situation, and I usually find them talking about money problems or yelling at each other.

3bbtzjBuaa	Well, that's not really a thesis statement.  It could suffice as a thesis question, but your thesis statement has to be the answer to the question posed.  If you have an answer and can back it up, it's a good thesis statement.  Ultimately, you want to find something that you can pull from the reading that gives it deeper meaning - that isn't blatantly pointed out in the text.  I have not read that text, but it sounds like a good question to ask.  Just come up with an answer, state it definitively, prove it in the body, then reiterate it throughout the body and in the conclusion.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	If you could point to a few publications and/or do very well on the English subject GRE (even if they don't require it) that could help a lot.  Most programs have a cutoff GPA of 3.0, and some aren't allowed to consider anyone with less than a 3.0 by university regulations (because you need to maintain a 3.0 GPA in grad school to remain enrolled).  If they won't consider you with that GPA, think about taking a few graduate-level courses as a non-degree student.  If you do well in those, you can use the grades as leverage to reapply to the program.  I've seen a few people get in this way, although to be honest none of them managed to finish the degree.|`|wipJ9OE7aa	It is very possible for you to get into graduate school with your G.P.A. You may be granted provisional admission where you have to take a number of graduate courses in the program before being granted full admission by the graduate school in which you would like to apply to and also maintain a certain GPA. A friend of mine had an overall GPA of 2.3 for undergraduate and was granted admission into graduate school in which he did very well. With graduate school you don't have the chance to get less than a certain GPA before they boot you. I myself didn't have such a great GPA and I will be headed into graduate school in the fall. So, I think that you need to look at the graduate school's requirements and see what the different type of admission status they have. My program did not require me to take the GRE or any other exam. I think that you can do it.|`|3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	Look for different graduate schools with Communication programs.  Talk to their admissions departments.  Some are going to be more strict than others.  I used to work in admissions and I strongly believe that you can find a school with your stats.  Good luck.|`|Czqmo9kdaa	Time to go to Devry

fIEP46xIaa	I noticed your question (and your other question about LSP) and just thought maybe I would try and give you a more helpful answer than some of the other people have on your previous posts.<br>  <br>  First off, I'm not quite sure all LSP decisions have been made because I just got accepted LSP yesterday. So you might not have to give up hope for that yet.<br>  <br>  I was looking at your stats and I must say that the only thing holding you back would be your GPA. I noticed others have been telling you your SAT's are not high enough. I myself got lower than you -- 1840 total -- and I got in. Also, you have ALOT more EC's than me (though it is important to keep in mind that colleges would rather have 5-6 very important and meaningful activities that you excel in rather than an overload of everything, so you should weigh whether or not that got across in your application), and it looks like you took a few more AP's than me. As for my own GPA, it wasn't stellar either. My GPA is a 3.71, but since NYU doesn't accept first semester senior grades my GPA on my application was a 3.66. While a 3.45 is rather unfortunate and could count as the final deciding factor, don't give up hope just yet. You definitely have some things I didn't have on my application. One thing you should examine, however, is your essay. If you had a killer essay, then I would tenatively say that your in. I'm almost certain that's what did it for me. Overall, I would say you have a chance (if not CAS, then you definitely have a chance for LSP). Anyway, just thought I would share with you so that you could determine how you stack up to someone who has been admitted through the Liberal Studies Program already! Best of luck to you.|`|GwFJzMilaa	dude you will so make it!!! Way to go :)
74935bb8e45f026d8f222b3b74cffd8faa	To put it in perspective: how do you know you're a good writer? Because you already have publications and royalties coming in, or because of what your high school teachers say?<br>  <br>  Writing, like any other talent, requires practice. You have to read a lot, write a lot, get used to doing research and get and use feedback to improve your work. If you're not already signing book deals, then you have a ways to go before you get there. High school good is not professional good; it means you have a knack for it, but you shouldn't be satisfied with just a knack. If it's a talent you're serious about turning into a career and not just a trashy romance novel for kicks, why let it stagnate at that high school level when it could become much better? <br>  <br>  (If the trashy romance novel for kicks is more what you're thinking, then there's no need to spend all the time and money on college, just read some trashy romance novels to get a feel for the formula and find a good editor.)<br>  <br>  There's no degree requirement to be an author, but most successful, respectable authors have at least one. That said, if you don't think you will return to writing until later in life, there's nothing wrong with returning to school to take writing and literature classes part time while a chef or even full time when you retire. <br>  <br>  Another thought would be to combine your passion for cooking and your passion for writing to write cookbooks. It might sound silly, but a witty, well-written cookbook will sell a lot better than one that reads like an instruction manual.|`|gDn1LVRxaa	You do not need to go to college to be an author; however I would highly recommend it. Taking a few classes at your local community college in creative writing or english may help your skills; however you do not need a college degree in or to get a book deal. If your books are interesting and a publishing company wants to publish it you can still receive a book deal. Good luck!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No, you don't have to have any degrees to be an author.  You just need to be a good writer and find someone willing to publish it.  But college could certainly help you refine your skills.|`|AA11404742	It might help.  If you get a degree in English Literature, for example, you will be exposed to many different writers and styles of writing.  That's not to say that amateurs can't write well.  Mark Twain was an amateur, after all.  But I think the education would definitely help.
gDn1LVRxaa	If you live in the United States you can enter community college and then transfer to a 4 year university. The beauty of it is, once you start at community college your high school transcript doesn't matter at all and almost no one will ever request to see it. You have a clean slate. Most community colleges have admissions agreements with local 4 year schools and you are promised a transfer spot as long as you have a GPA 3.0+. Look into this and good luck!|`|AA10162167	It sounds like a good plan.  I would check out what classes will be req'd for the double major...then see if you can take some of those classes at the community college.  This will make it easier to double major.  Keep in mind also you can take an extra semester if you really want to double major...you could also take a major and minor.  You don't have to make all the decisions now...but it is a good idea to plan out your 4 years especially if you know which 4 yr university you're likely to attend.|`|E047GSKdaa	Yes!  Community Colleges produce more students that eventually earn 4 year degrees then state universities do!  <br>  The secret nobody tells you is that the best college student is not the smart one, it is the persistent one!  Go to CC and find what you love.  Find the subject that is very interesting to you.  Set the curve!|`|qlY4VO8caa	as soon as you are in a four year college you should be able to.<br>  <br>  have a talk with your chem teacher.|`|3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	It largely depends which four-year college or university you want to attend.  Some colleges accept students because those students have money and breathe air.  Other colleges accept students based upon rigorous academic and volunteer qualifications.  And then there is the range in between.<br>  <br>  Getting some lower level coursework that can transfer in can be a very good idea and a great way to save money in the long run.<br>  <br>  One other piece of advice - stay away from student loans.  Only go to a college that you can afford.  Others will disagree with me on this, but as a person who works in Financial Aid at a college and am also a financial counselor as a side business, I'd strongly encourage you to stay away from loans.  Don't believe me?  Talk to *ten* other people who have graduated _at least a year ago_ with more than $10,000 in debt (easy to find) and ask them if they recommend that you take out loans too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Dude, let me give you some great advice.  Find what you LOVE and begin to investigate every nuance about the subject.  For instance, if I LOVE writing, which I do, I would begin to look online for correspondence classes I could take, I would borrow books from the library that the librarian recommended (smart and wonderful people these librarians). I would take classes locally at my community college, or night classes at the adult tech center in town.  I would also join a critique group in town or start one if necessary.  Then I would go to writers conferences when I could afford them.  I would find websites that are related to my field of interest.  I would bug the daylights out of a local writer to teach me everything they know or at least find a job that required me to write and bug the daylights out of my bosses to teach me by asking lots of questions about writing.  Be self-educated by taking advantage of EVERYTHING you can that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg.  When all else fails...go military.  You will learn a lot of amazing things there and get a free education on top of it.  Then when you get out...if you want to...you can have Uncle Sam pay for your education further.  All this means a great low cost education.  Community College is a great way to get your feet wet.  Go for it!|`|cae2a17c25e7a1c76d057e7937dd807caa	My answer is a resounding YES!  I recommend going to a Community College before going to a 4 year school.  Your HS GPA will not matter to Universities after you have completed 24 transferrable credits at a Commmunity College, sometimes less.  <br>  <br>  Double majors have nothing to do with where you attend school.  It only matters what you want to major in, and the degree plan you come up with.  If you need help, let me know and I can help you plan something out.

This diversion can cause the bowels to loosen and accidently cause you to soil yourself. The phrase just means the person is going to scare you alot.

You would be placed in a care for the elderly ward rather than an accident and emergency or medical/surgical ward, as this would provide a safe learning environment.  <br>  <br>  You could even contact a local nursing home and enquire about it with home manager if they are situated closer to home than the hospital.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pH4KCV8Jaa	depends on the hospital i guess, but yes.

ws0nvFi5aa	I'm not sure what a TAG sentence is. But a thesis statement is a statement where you are arguing your point and trying to proof it. It's like an argument statement where you state what you believe. It's located at the end of the first paragraph. <br>  <br>    But make sure that the thesis shouldn't be a sentence of facts, it's based on your own opinion. <br>  <br>    Make sure to be careful of not using start-off words like, "I believe" or "In my opinion" <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    Example of a weak thesis: <br>  The North and South fought the Civil War for many reasons, some of which were the same and some different.<br>  <br>   Example of a strong thesis: <br>  While both Northerners and Southerners believed they fought against tyranny and oppression, Northerners focused on the oppression of slaves while Southerners defended their own right to self-government.<br>  <br>  (I didn't make up these examples, it was from another website)|`|RBoQPtA0aa	I will be happy to help but you are just like me bro i don't get it either just by looking at it?

You just describe how multi-celled organisms can reproduce asexually. If this is after a section of reading, then the answer is probably in that. :)|`|kqMDzJw0aa	It is extremely rare for multicelluar organisms to reproduce a sexually, but it can be done. <br>  <br>  Some sexual organisms partially revert to the asexual mode by a periodic degeneration of the sexual process. Proteins are reproduced directly; however, such other substances as carbohydrates, fats, and other organic molecules found in cells are produced by a series of enzyme-controlled chemical reactions, each enzyme being derived originally from DNA through messenger RNA. After cell reproduction evolved into multicellular growth, the multicellular organism evolved a means of reproducing itself that is best described as life-cycle reproduction.

RuimqHavaa	On February 6, 1895, Kate Schamberger Ruth gave birth to her first child. George Herman Ruth, Jr., was born in the house of his grandparents in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the first of eight children born to Kate and George Herman Ruth. Unfortunately, most of the children died in infancy, and only George, Jr., and his sister Mamie survived to lead a full life.<br>  <br>  Ruth's father worked as a bartender and ultimately opened his own tavern. He and his wife spent little time with their son because they worked long hours. Contrary to popular belief, young George was not an orphan. For the first seven years of his life he was with his parents, but he survived without guidance on the dirty, crowded streets of the Baltimore riverfront.<br>  <br>  Young George experienced little, if any, real love from his parents who made no time for their son. Ultimately, they felt that they could no longer care for their son and on June 13, 1902, George Herman Ruth took his seven-year-old to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Not only did he place young George in the school, but he signed over custody of the boy to the Xaverian Brothers, a Catholic Order of Jesuit Missionaries who ran St. Mary's. <br>  <br>  St. Mary's was both a reformatory and orphanage, which was surrounded by a wall similar to a prison with guards on duty. There were approximately 800 children at St. Mary's, which had four dormitories that housed about 200 kids each. George, Jr., who by the age of seven had already been involved with mischievous altercations, was classified as "incorrigible" upon his admission. Although for a few brief periods he was returned to live with his family, he was always sent back to St. Mary's, and no one ever came to visit him while he was there.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ruth with one of the Xaverian Brothers at St. Mary's.<br>  ???? The Babe Ruth Museum <br>  <br>  Perhaps the one positive thing stemming from his time at St. Mary's was meeting Brother Mathias. Brother Mathias was the main disciplinarian at St. Mary's. He spent a great deal of time with George, Jr., providing the guidance and support that the youngster did not receive from his parents. He even helped young Ruth develop as a baseball player. It is because of his difficult childhood and the positive influence of Brother Mathias that Babe Ruth came to love children and why all of his life he went out of his way to do things for kids, especially those in need.<br>  <br>  Baseball was a popular and primary form of recreation for the boys at St. Mary's and young George Ruth, Jr., displayed his potential at a young age. He played all positions on the field, was an excellent pitcher and certainly had the ability to hit the ball. By his late teens Ruth had developed into a major league baseball prospect. On February 27, 1914, at the age of nineteen, Ruth was signed to his first professional baseball contract by Jack Dunn, manager of the Baltimore Orioles, at the time a minor league franchise in the International League. Because Ruth's parents had signed over custody of the youngster to St. Mary's he was supposed to remain at the school until the age of twenty-one. To circumvent this, Dunn became Ruth's legal guardian.<br>  <br>  Jack Dunn was well known for picking up youngsters whom he thought had major league potential. When George Ruth, Jr., appeared with Dunn at the ball park the other players started cracking jokes, and one of the players quipped, "Well, here's Jack's newest Babe." The rest of the players also started referring to young George as "Babe" and the name stuck. Thus began the storied career of Babe Ruth.<br>  <br>  Just five months after being signed by the Baltimore Orioles, Babe Ruth was sold to the Boston Red Sox. He made his debut as a major leaguer in Fenway Park on July 11, 1914, pitching against the Cleveland Indians.<br>  <br>  In the mornings, Ruth would frequent Landers' Coffee Shop in Boston, and it is here that he met Helen Woodford, a seventeen-year-old waitress. They married on October 17, 1914 at St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in Ellicott City, Maryland. As Babe's career began to blossom and his salary increased, by 1919 he was making $10,000 per year, he and Helen were able to buy a home outside of Boston in Sudbury, Massachusetts.<br>  <br>  In December of 1919 Babe was sold to the New York Yankees, owned by Colonel Jacob Ruppert and managed by Miller Huggins. Prior to Ruth's arrival in New York, the team had never won a pennant. With "The Babe" as part of their arsenal they became a dominant force in major league baseball, winning seven pennants and four World Championships from 1920 to 1933. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dorothy, Claire, Babe and Julia leaving for a trip in January of 1931.<br>  ???? The Babe Ruth Museum <br>  <br>  In New York, Babe and Helen moved into the Ansonia Hotel on Broadway, which was also the New York home for many celebrities. Unlike her husband, Helen was shy and reserved and did not enjoy the constant notoriety that accompanied Babe wherever he went. As a result, she preferred staying at their rural home outside of Boston, w|`|1113a0e16d7694011f5bdb01076e75dfaa	<a href="http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/ansonia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/an...</a><br>  <br>  Gee, that was hard.

It probably has something to do with the fact that, like the science majors, there are clinicals/labs that take up a lot of your time--but you only get like 1 credit hour for it. And this is not including the paperwork that must be done for the clinical/labs.<br>  <br>  So, if you want a challenge, be a nerd!

buUIYQPCaa	Children this age love hands-on activities.  That means they need to be actively involved.  You need to keep them moving in some way:  dancing, marching, clapping, hand and finger motions, musical instruments.  Also, check out your choice of music.  It needs to be busy, active, fun.

idBqkqUSaa	Authors tell stories within stories, to give the book more detail, and kind of give you a better picture. The stories help create an image in your head, by giving you more examples, and things you can personally relate to.

AA10148570	After you graduate from high school, which I am sure you will make happen no matter the difficulty, you will have many opportunities in life. Not all of these will involve college. When you write a resume, or when you tell people your history, you'll probably just name your high school and your graduating year when talking about that part of your formal education- there won't be anything in there about grades. However, if you are intent on going to college and your grades are low, it's not the end of the world. You're not a senior, first off. Check with the junior college you want to attend and ask what its entering requirements are. You can ask your teachers for help, or find someone willing to tutor you, and you can study more during breaks, over the summer. In a private high school there will probably be more opportunities for help than in a public high school, or at least that is my experience. Keep working, but don't stress about it. Just do your best and know that you will find a way to be happy in life.|`|bXcmhRUOaa	It sounds as though you don't belong at this particular school.

The class will think you are looking at them, and the teacher will think you are looking at your audience.<br>  <br>  Don't notice any reaction from the class. Their reaction doesn't matter, but it might make you feel more nervous.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on what you are saying rather than how you are saying it. <br>  <br>  Don't try to keep from stuttering as that will make you stutter more. If you stutter, just let it happen.<br>  <br>  Maintain a steady pace, not too fast, and don't get in a hurry to "get it over with."  <br>  <br>  Speak in a relaxed manner and pause every so often.<br>  <br>  Start into words easily keeping your lips, tongue, and jaw relaxed.|`|5I01tsgYaa	The thing that worked best for me was to practice my presentation over and over until I had it practically memorized.|`|Vt1ZACkDaa	haha i know where you are coming from. i just had to do a presentation a few days ago and my was i scared to crap. i was so afraid the days before, and on that day while i was waiting for my turn, i was like shivering. but once i did the presentation, i felt really good. like "omg i did it" kind of good. so here are some tips which sort of help me.<br>  <br>  1) you might be so nervous you tend to drink a lot of water - so remember go do your thing in the toilet before the presentation. cause having to stand infront of the class and wanting to go to the loo would be pretty bad.<br>  <br>  2) you can drink some water before you present just to help you calm your nerves.<br>  <br>  3) Give eye contact to the audience. like you have to look up and look at them and not just only read from your notes. it might be pretty scary to look everyone in the eye, so when you look up...look at the back wall of the classroom. this way you would seem to be giving eye contact to the auidence, when you are really starring at a wall.<br>  <br>  4) present yours first. that usually helps. usually having to anticipate and wait for you turn would be more nerve racking then actually presenting to the class.<br>  <br>  5) be confident and smile. that way it is easier to cover up any mistakes you might have made.<br>  <br>  good luck=)
qXpxILnRaa	Domain Archaea are orgainsms that are not bacteria. Domain Archaea is mostly composed of cells that live in extreme environments. While they are able to live elsewhere, they are usually not found there because outside of extreme environments they are competitively excluded by other organisms. Species of the domain Archaea are not inhibited by antibiotics, lack peptidoglycan in their cell wall (unlike bacteria, which have this sugar/polypeptide compound), and can have branched carbon chains in their membrane lipids of the phospholipid bilayer. It is believed that Archaea are very similar to prokaryotes that inhabited the earth billions of years ago. It is also believed that eukaryotes evolved from Archaea, because they share many mRNA sequences, have similar RNA polymerases, and have introns. Therefore, it is believed that the domains Archaea and Bacteria branched from each other very early in history, and membrane infolding produced eukaryotic cells in the archaean branch approximately 1.7 billion years ago.

HnLLy8wHaa	On the most basic level, post structuralism is essentially a theory on how knowledge is produced.<br>  <br>  If you've studied the basics of structuralism (such as Saussure's signifier-signified), then you can take post structuralism to mean that the relationship between the signifier and signified is ambiguous. That is to say, there is no finite reason that we call a tree a tree, a car a car, etc. There is nothing inherently "tree like" about a tree, rather humans have created the meaning of a tree, and subsequently create the word and associations with the word.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, post structuralism has a lot to do with one's self. In other words, nearly everything relates back to the reader. Key tenants of the post structuralist dogma say that one relates to a text through how they view themselves in regard to the text. That is to say, every person SHOULD have a different interpretation of a text based on how they view themselves (ie: their cultural identity/social class/etc). This leads to another key tenant, which is that post structuralism essentially requires that a text have more than one interpretation. In essence, every reader creates a new and individual meaning for a given text.

The bigger person will always endeavor to show respect to others, even to those who fail in that area of politeness.<br>  <br>  There is confusion about what respect means. For example, we can respect people whom we have never made contact with simply because we admire them as a person in their own right or because of what they have achieved in their lifetime.<br>  <br>  There is an unwritten code of behavior expected of us all. To be polite (A form of respect) toward others. To be compassionate, understanding, lovingly disposed toward our fellow man and all this without them doing anything to earn it.<br>  <br>  When people treat us badly, we shouldn't automatically 'switch on' to 'disrespect' mode. We can be the bigger person and avoid being a 'reactor'. Yes, I know it is hard to do that, however, when we adopt that attitude we do not poison our hearts or allow anger to flood our body.<br>  <br>  As a teacher, I continually make allowances and the reason I do this is because my 'life experience' has shown me that many times those who misuse or abuse us are unhappy through stuff that is contaminating their life. We simply don't know how they are suffering.<br>  <br>  Respect is the gift you give yourself.|`|ofQ1QM1Saa	I don't think all teachers are like that, only some. For example, one of my teachers expects respect, by paying attention in class, etc. However, he always shows respect to his students, by devoting outside time to help them and being willing to answer questions. However, there are some teachers who want respect but don't reciprocate it, and some on the other end, who give lots of respect but don't receive a lot.|`|I9uI8X6baa	You should show respect toward any adult, even if they are not giving it to you.  I know it's a hard pill to swallow... but remember, two wrongs do not make a right.  I am a teacher, and it is nearly impossible to be rude to a polite student.  On the other hand, it is VERY easy to be rude to a disrespectful student.|`|gnRiLwSxaa	Some teachers are like that, but most will treat you with respect if you are attentive and polite.     Teachers have to deal with anywhere from 100 to 200 students per day, many of whom are difficult and do not care about school.    It's hard to be polite and cheerful at all times in that situation.|`|ec7faabfad01fb70cf9da66d5b00110caa	Someday you will have a 12 year old say 'whatever' and put their hand in your face, and you will want to hit them... hard, but you won't. You'll become a dick to them and make them fear the sight of you. And that anger that you once held for their blatant disrespect (which would have got them slugged as an adult) will melt away as you make them do some humiliating task over and over like a dog.

Also, they level the playing field- you are not singled out because you aren't wearing the latest fashion, or because you can't afford decent clothing. Uniforms therefore in theory allow you to focus on study.<br>  Uniforms are bad because they don't allow you to express individuality. You all look the same so think the same/ conform!? Uniforms can be uncomfortable. If you're uncomfortable/ too hot/ too cold how can you focus in the classroom. At the end of the day, they're just clothes so have no bearing on getting good grades.(study & doing the work or just being a genius are probably more the reason!)|`|HQFfb1Vvaa	No, the grades are determined by the quality and how intensive the teaching is.

HQFfb1Vvaa	Im afraid you're going to have to be more specific. you could argue that uniforms show you are part of a specific school so there could be fights between competing schools. But this is easily rebutted by saying that violence between schools is caused by a lack of communication and poor managament and teaching rather than uniforms themselves. I went to a uniform wearing school, as did all my friends, and I can tell you that violence is caused by the people themselves and their own backgrounds, not by the clothes they wear.|`|I9uI8X6baa	The idea of school uniforms is to make everyone look the same so there is no bullying, etc. because of socio-economic status.

WDy7ng4yaa	I think that you should go back an extra half year because my step-mom has a GED, and she says that she can't get as many jobs as those with a diploma since she never completed HS. Besides, if cosmetology doesn't work out for you, don't you want to have an education to back fall on? I'm not saying that it won't work out, but with the way the economy is, you should just go back for an extra half year to get the missing credits, and graduate with your class, and have more options.|`|AA10481071	I got a GED and I'm fine|`|I9uI8X6baa	the diploma is better, but a GED is better than nothing|`|7KS5qPydaa	I would totally do the extra half year because when you apply for jobs you are far more certain to be picked with a diploma also it is good to know what you are doing as best as possible|`|7YIEOXr2aa	i think you should go back the extra half year. i would because a diploma is more valuable to me.
fPOg9DuXaa	First graders learn a lot in first grade reading: <br>  <br>  1) They do a review of the basic letter sounds a-z<br>  <br>  2) Then they start doing the digraphs: sh, ch, wh and th. They start combining these to make basic words: like shut, or that. <br>  <br>  3) Then they add in the long vowel sounds. This is very tricky for a lot of first graders. They learn the a_e, etc. patterns first like in the word cake, bite, Pete. These words can be taught as the 'e' is very bossy and he tells the vowel to say his own name and then he is silent. After this, they learn all the long vowel combinations like ai, ay, etc. <br>  <br>  4) Toward the end of the year, they learn the 'r' controlled sounds and letter combinations like ar, ir, er, or, oo. <br>  <br>  5) Throughout the year, a very important thing that they learn are sight words. In my district, first graders learn 230 sight words over the course of the year. These are words they can't sound out, they just have to memorize them. There is the Dolch sight word list (spelling?), or check with the child's teacher to see what sight word list they are using. Sight words are great done with flash cards. But don't do all 200 at once! Take a few. Master those. Add a few more. Go back and review, etc. <br>  <br>  6) Students continue with all these sounds and sight words to build fluency (reading quickly and accurately). They should be able to read 60 words in one minute by the end of first grade. This would be good thing to monitor with your tutee. Once a week, time them reading a passage for one minute and see how they are doing. <br>  <br>  7) And, don't forget comprehension (understanding of the story). Make sure the student can identify who is in the story. What are the characters doing? Where are they, etc.? This is a great gateway skill for tougher comprehension ahead in 2nd and 3rd grade. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good luck!!!|`|1Vxayygdaa	I teach second grade, but have many kindergarten and 1st grade level readers.  After students get the basic letter sounds and short vowel sounds, teach consonant combinations, or when 2 consonants go together. (tr like in trip, fl like in flag, bl like in blue, dr like in drive, etc)<br>  You can also teach the "ch" sound, the "th" sound, the "sh" sound, and then go into long vowels like when there is a silent e at the end.  ("Make" has a long a sound, but the e is silent.)<br>  <br>  Overall, you need to see what your student knows and what he doesn't.  Then go from there.  Good luck!|`|eJO4OC2saa	Generally letter sounds and toward the end some basic blending of three letter words. B goes Buh, A goes Ah, T goes Tuh.  Buh, Ah, Tuh. Bat. :)|`|7uedTD6Iaa	Carrunner is correct.  To expand on that a little bit, 1st graders should also be learning sight words, also called high frequency words.  You can look on line for the Dolch Sight Word List or the Fry Instant Word List.  These will give you the most common sight words 1st graders needs.

3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	Moving away from home can be one of the hardest and most rewarding things an individual can do.  It is good to get outside the environment you grew up in to expand your horizons and learn about how other people live their lives (as opposed to how you've always seen it work).<br>  <br>  I would, however, strongly encourage you to quickly develop a good support system (if you are religious, a place of worship may help) with other quality people.  I moved from California to Virginia without any social support and it was harder than I thought (though, I made it through fine).  <br>  <br>  One thing to know about college:  you will find what you're looking for.  If you're looking for professional, quality people - you will find them.  If you are looking for people who just want to party - you will find them.

tehdmkjkaa	e)   CORRECT USE OF ITALICS.  Set in italics the names of full-length published works: i.e.  Macbeth  ,  Jane Eyre  ,  Great Expectations.  In exams, indicate italics by underlining such titles:  Macbeth  ,  Jane Eyre  ,  Great Expectations  . This is the equivalent of italics in published material.<br>  <br>  This traditional system has many advantages, most notably clarity. But also, you don't have to say: 'Macbeth's character shows …' or 'In the play Macbeth …' because Macbeth [in italics] always means the play; Macbeth [without italics] always means the character within the play.<br>  <br>  Short works (i.e. individual short poems, short stories, chapters of books, critical essays, etc.) are not in italics. They just take quotation marks: 'Two Look at Two', 'Strange Meeting', 'The Birthday Party'. A whole volume of poems on the other hand (i.e. a complete longer work, published as such) does take italics. Again, this makes for accuracy and simplicity. Philip Larkin wrote a volume of poems called Whitsun Weddings —when written in italics like this, it indicates you are referring to the whole volume. He also wrote an individual short title-poem to the volume called 'Whitsun Weddings'. The difference between italics (or underlining) and single quotation marks indicates immediately which we mean, without having to indicate this in any other way. So, also, with Katherine Mansfield: The Garden-Party indicates the whole volume of short stories of that name; 'The Garden-Party' indicates the single story within that volume.<br>  <br>  There is a short poem by Robert Frost called 'Two Look at Two'. Because it is a short poem (part of a larger volume) it should be as here, in quotation marks. For titles of works, never use italics and quotation marks together. It is one or the other. Do not write 'Two Look at Two' .|`|XnlTjVGaaa	Either put it in quotes or italicize it.|`|Hoe7sJM4aa	When the title of the poem is used you put the title of the poem in quotations. This is what my teachers have taught me and I'm taught using MLA style. If it is a stand-alone works (you can hold it in your hand without it being attached to anything; ex. a book, play, CD) you underline it according to MLA style. If it is a part of another piece of works, you put it in quotations (you cannot hold the entirety of the object in your hand, it is connected to a larger works; ex. a song, poem, article, chapter title, etc). Italicize is almost never used.|`|V9qmbFQOaa	The style will vary according to the educational institution's preferred style. However as a general rule for universities, schools and journalism, titles should just be just within quotation marks, eg <br>  Most people's favourite Shakespearean play is "Romeo and Juliet" <br>  or <br>  John  Keats' poem "Ode to a Nightingale"  is still regarded as perfect.|`|QRtFW4GWaa	If your teacher is a fan of the MLA format, its in quotations.  You underline the title of the volume it comes from.  Most teachers, however, will accept any one of the three as long as a) you are consistent (so if you are going to underline a poem title you ALWAYS underline a poem title) and b) it isn't an assignment specifically for a class about writing essays properly.|`|z1YwRbcSaa	I believed you'd use Italics

ejodXS5naa	Well, here are a few thoughts.  Caltech has easily one of the best biology programs in the world.  They have made huge investments in biology in the last decade and they sit very well amongst their peers in biology.  A med school and a biology program are so unrelated that I don't understand why you would even suggest that Caltech's lack of a med school has any impact on their biology program.  If you think these two disciplines are related, you are monumentally incorrect.  Med school teaches you how to cut a person open and how to cure a person if they have green ooze coming out of their nose.  A biology school teaches you how life works, what chemistry is important in life, genetics, evolution, and much more.  I do not see a relationship.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, I do not understand why you would need to transfer to another school for a PhD.  First off, you seem to want an MD instead of a PhD (which Caltech does not offer, you need a med school for an MD).   Second off, if you do want a PhD, Caltech certainly offers them in biology, but you would need to apply again for a PhD, since that is a graduate degree that you get after you graduate with you BS (there is no transferring involved, since you graduated and re-applied).  I think you may be confused.<br>  <br>  And if you think Stanford is too research oriented, then Caltech is certainly not the place for you.  The only way that Caltech is a good premed school is if you plan on doing medical research.  Otherwise, I think you will find that Caltech is much too rigorous, does not inflate its grades, and is not well enough known by medical programs.  It will be easier to get into a top medical program if you have great grades from an average school than average grades from a great school that is not well known.<br>  <br>  From what you say, I think Stanford is a better choice for you.<br>  <br>  And, on a final note, I don't know what you mean by "VERY capable with being in either school".  Being 8th in your class is not impressive by the standards of either Caltech or Stanford.  During my time on the admissions committee at Caltech, I'm sure I saw more valedictorians (1st in their class) who got rejected then got accepted.  Perhaps you have more strengths than being 8th.  But I know that getting into either Caltech or Stanford is very difficult and quite a privilege.  Since they are looking for different things, very few people get into both.  So your decision may be made for you.|`|FTmmYSx5aa	I would pick Stanford University. Cal Tech is very very small and only accept like 800 students each year. Cal Tech you are required to have a 750+ on your math section of your SAT. Stanford University is such a beautiful campus. My cousin is actually the head of the science and engineering department there. Good luck and I hope you do very well in your future studies.

ND1nFEWSaa	Mentos is a brand of mints, of the "scotch mint" type, sold in many markets across the world by the Perfetti Van Melle Corporation. Mentos was first produced in the Netherlands during the 1950s. The mints are small oblate spheroids, with a slightly hard exterior and a soft, chewy interior. They are sold in rolls which typically contain 14 candies, although the new "Sour Mix" flavor contains only 11 candies per roll. Certain flavors are sold in boxes in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the rolls in three and six-packs. The slogan of Mentos is "The FreshMaker." Most Mentos packages describe the candy as "chewy dragées." <br>  <br>  <br>  open a litre of pepsi and drop a mentos candy in it and see what happens
OJtZRHTMaa	You put it on the u.<br>  The vowel always goes on the second to last syllable of the word. When you add the ending the second to last syllable shifts, but you still want the accent in the same place, so you put the accent there. To figure out where the accent goes, take the word without the indirect object, so you'd have: ayuda. The u is the second to last syllable, so in that form no accent is needed. When you add the nos onto the end you want the accent to stay in the same place, so the accent is on the u.
vxfZNQzvaa	All of these answers are good (except the Twilight one), btw I love the Catcher in The Rye.<br>  Anyway, my recommendations would be<br>  1) Dracula by Bram Stoker (really entertaining,will keep you hooked) <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Dracula/Bram-Stoker/e/9780486411095/?itm=2" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Dracula...</a><br>  <br>  2) The Stranger by Albert Camus (This one is really good too, and its short. But it is a bit complicated if you want to find all of the metaphors and all of that, but the story and the character is enough to keep you wanting to read it). <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Stranger/Albert-Camus/e/9780679720201/?itm=17" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Str...</a><br>  <br>  3) The Metamorphosis by Kafka (It's a really weird book but there is a lot of symbolism. Anyway, it's short, only 46 pgs I think. The story is pretty good. It's high school level because I had to read it for English class and I am in the 11th grade. What made it complicated was finding all of the symbolism. Its about a guy who one day wakes up transformed to a bug.) <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Metamorphosis/Franz-Kafka/e/9781599866147/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Met...</a><br>  <br>  4) Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achabe (I really like this book. The story is really good and there is a lot of character development. It shows the reader a lot about the specific culture in the time period that the book takes place, and it talks a lot about the man being dominant and all that. Religion is a big part of this book because missionaries come to try to convert the African culture.

Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means.

When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains.

I suggest you do, because you are not losing anything, instead, your gaining. Good luck.

A lot of "light pollution" means that there's too much light from buildings and streetlights to properly see the stars - only the strongest can be seen, or none can be seen at all.  The further you get from houses, buildings, and streetlights, the less light pollution there is.  So, if you're in a rural area where it's very dark you can see a lot more stars than if you're in the suburbs or a city where it's not that dark at night.

AA11128305	For the activities, it can add to your CV, but it's not essential. I didn't mention any whatsoever and still got onto the course I wanted. Courses teaching you how to use a computer are often looked upon as a good thing, but it's somewhat assumed that younger people will know how to use them now.<br>  <br>  I'll be honest about the friend bit and not just say it's easy. Unless you live in the dorms, you'll likely not make friends easily. Even if you do, you might not get along with the people there. It's often quite difficult to make more than casual friends unless you're good at group situations, not good for those of us who aren't. In courses with a high student count too or lots of lecturing rather than small group work, it can be difficult to get to know people. If you're a girl, there are usually plenty of guys willing to be friendly to a girl living away from home for the first time, but not because they want to be friends.

Nuuk1Nwtaa	It's relatively easy--it is a state college, and there are 19 thousand plus kids who go there. But you didn't say what your grades are or what makes you stand out. I live in the town next to Amherst and my boyfriend goes to UMass-Amherst, and I know plenty of kids that I look at and wonder how they even made it out of high school. You'll most likely make it.
12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Yes, you have to study.  Why?  Because 1) you're given a lot in a short ammount of time  2) you spend less time in the class room than in HS which means less time going over material  3) often a professor will say "do this"  "this will be on the exam"  "you need to know this" but, never go over it more in class.<br>  <br>  My advice is seek help at fist sign of trouble and always do you homework!  If you do your homework and get that extra pratice you'll do much better than those who don't.  Go to tutoring and get help on HOW to study.  These services should be offered at your college.  When you study you want to review the NOTES you've taken in class (take them!!!  very important!!).  Review anything the teacher wrote on the board or spent a lot of time talking about.  Review any homework given...it was given b/c it's an imp. concept.  Read your book and make sure you know BOLD words.  Know any important formulas and how to use.  <br>  <br>  As a freshmen you may not know how to study.  When taking your major classes try to figure out your professors...what they like and feel is important.  You will get better studying and realizing how much time you need to devote w/ pratice.  For example...in my Spanish class I've taken a course w/ this professor before.  He also said in class I want you to have an understanding of what happened in this time period.  So, because our previous quiz had dates I KNEW the exam would require dates.  I wrote out a time-line and did very well on the exam.<br>  <br>  It also is ok to ask your professor for resources...they can only say no.  lol  Ask for a outline of what will be covered over the exam.  Also, (esp when freshmen) ask HOW to study and what you should utilize to study.  <br>  <br>  Be prepared to spend more time on your studies especially your first term.  You don't want to make easy mistakes you will regret later.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12221077	Well that depends.  Do you want to spend all that money and come out of college with no education?  If I were you, I'd stop thinking about my education as something to avoid, and I'd take advantage of the opportunity you're being given.  Do you have any idea how many people would LOVE to go to college and improve their minds?|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	I hope you enjoy working at Burger King for the rest of your life.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	First, you will have to study A LOT MORE.  I went to a private school, and I know that makes a big difference (between very large state universities), but I had to study a whole lot more!  I studied regularly in high school, but not very much and maintained a decently high GPA despite being in all AP classes.  Hope that helps you gage how much studying you might have to do in the future.  <br>  <br>  Second, to get into graduate school and/or help with getting a job, you must study so that you can go above and beyond "just passing."  If I had only just passed everything, I would never have been able to gain acceptance into ANY law schools.  Not to mention how great being in half a dozen honor societies looks.  <br>  <br>  And every HR rep for every company knows that when you don't put your GPA on your resume that it's because it sucks.  It just SCREAMS, I like to get away with lazy antics rather than try and learn and even occasionally bust my butt for a good cause!|`|lQ35kPPGaa	It depends on what college you go to and what major.<br>  <br>  If you go to a community,city, state college you won't have to work as hard as someone attending a prestigious private uni. I have friends from highschool that never study have 3.8 GPAs mostly majoring in political science, English, literature etc (mostly liberal studies).<br>  <br>  I am currently attending a prestigious private university majoring in mechanical engineering, my classes start at 9AM and they end at 3PM, afterwards I usually study to 9PM-10PM taking 10 minute breaks every hour with only a 3.1 GPA.|`|y2pErbI2aa	Pretty much, yeah. I was basically the same way in HS, and my GPA is suffering because of it now.<br>  <br>  There are a few subjects you can get by without it (especially if you have a good teacher), but if you want to do well, you're actually gonna have to crack the book open|`|3UuWvrAjaa	umm yes you have to study... are you the one going to SunY old westbury in the fall? did u get accepted yet if so? just email me with the answer cuz idk how else u could answer it.<br>  k thanks|`|AA11724052	sure do!|`|AA10148570	Do you have to study? It depends on how much you know already of the subject you are studying, how quickly you absorb information, and how hard classes are. This last factor is often determined by the college you decide to attend. If you are going to attend a community college and are an honors student in high school you might not need to study often, for instance.<br>  My advice is to try to find something you love to do, something you want to spend your life doing. A job involving doing this thing might or might not require a college education, but if it does, and you go to college to study this exciting subject, you will find that you'll actually want to study. High school classes can be boring. College classes are all about what you want to learn, and at this point in life you just need to make choices and see what happens.<br>  You have time. You can even take a "gap" year off school and explore work opportunities. If studying is not your thing, don't let that stop you. Do what you wish!|`|gbCB0ohJaa	Many people arrive at university without adequate study stills to succeed.  Universities have study-skills programs designed to help students change their habits and succeed, but students often don't take advantage of these resources until they are in academic difficulty.  <br>  <br>  You are going to be ahead of things if you start planning now.  Try improving on your note-taking in class (even if the teacher gives handouts, see how well you can do at taking notes without them).  Read over your notes after class.  Before a test, make a summary page of the important concepts in the unit.  Ask your more helpful teachers for tips on preparing for university.  Save all your course materials from senior year and take them to university with you, as they may come in handy when you take a more advanced course on similar topics.|`|VZ21gL81aa	There is no law requiring you to study. Likewise there is no exact definition of what would constitute 'studying'.<br>  <br>  Assumptions:<br>  1. studying implies reading the assigned materials before class;<br>  2. studying implies completing (on time) all required assignments;<br>  <br>  Then Yes, one must study to get through college. The key is to stay up to date, because the profs all get together in secret meeting chambers and decide that they will all assign papers due the same day, and will all give mid-terms the same day. It is their way of exerting control and exercising authority. They also get a lot of pleasure out of seeing most of their students stressing out from ODs of RedBull.<br>  <br>  Your existing study habits are the result of you being unchallenged by an unchallenging HS curriculum. <br>  <br>  Ok, some classes in college are not too tough, one term paper and one final exam, others have daily assignments. Keep up, learn to balance your time, andyou will do fine.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	College is advanced High School.

ke0dsgkkaa	Historical Background<br>  <br>  Slavery in Canada<br>  <br>  Britain’s and France’s involvement in the Transatlantic Slave Trade began in the 1500s and expanded with the establishment of their colonies in North America and the Caribbean. In 1713, British slavers became the main traders of Africans when they won the assiento from Spain. The assiento was permission given by the Spanish government to sell slaves in the Spanish colonies. The captured Africans were exported to British colonies in North America, South America, the Caribbean, and Britain itself. There is no evidence of either British or French slave ships landing in Canada, but we know that slaves lived in Canada and that they were often purchased in other slave markets and brought here either by their owners or by merchants.<br>  <br>  Slavery was part of Canada’s early development, starting with the enslavement of Aboriginal peoples. Enslaved Aboriginal people were called Panis because it was the Panis (or Pawnee) tribe from which most of them came. Slaves were needed to work in the developing industries of fishing, mining, and forestry, but Panis were sometimes difficult to control so the colonists began to use Africans as a source of free labour.  French settlers imported and used enslaved Africans as early as 1628.  The enslavement of Africans existed in Canada for just over 200 years.<br>  <br>  During the French regime, the majority of enslaved people were Aboriginals. However, when New France came under the control of Britain in 1760, the overwhelming number of enslaved people were of African descent.<br>  <br>  King Louis XIV gave approval for the purchase and use of enslaved Africans on May 1, 1689. Then in 1709, Intendant Jacques Raudot declared that slavery was legal in New France:<br>  <br>  . . . Hence, in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty, we order that those who have bought or who will hereafter buy any Pani or Negro are to be granted complete ownership of that slave; that these Panis or Negroes are to be forbidden from leaving their Masters; and that a fifty-pound fine is to be levied on anyone who incites slaves to leave their Masters . . .<br>  <br>  (Ordinance by Intendant Raudot on the subject of slavery in Canada, 13 April 1709)<br>  <br>  Canada’s early nation building depended on slavery, albeit on a smaller scale. The inhabitants of New France brought enslaved Africans to work in the fur trade, in mining and fishing, and to clear and farm the land. Many also worked as domestics in households. Under British rule, settlers also benefited from the free labour of enslaved Africans in a variety of capacities, as well as through the import and use of slave-produced goods and by profiting from the sale of products like cod and timber that were transported along the Transatlantic Slave Routes to plantations in the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  Slavery was institutionalized, meaning it was supported by the government and protected by laws in New France and British North America.  When Britain gained control of Acadia in 1713, under the Treaty of Utrecht, more enslaved Africans were brought into the new province of Nova Scotia from New England by White settlers. When Britain conquered the French forces in 1760, the Treaty of Paris was signed between the two powers.  Article 47 of the Articles of Capitulation acknowledged and recognized Canadians’ right to continue to own slaves:<br>  <br>  Negroes and panis of both sexes shall remain, in their status as slaves, in possession of the French and Canadians to whom they belong; they shall be at liberty to keep them in their service in the colony or sell them; and they may also continue to bring them up in the Roman religion.<br>  <br>  After the American Revolution, there was an increase in Canada’s African population, both enslaved and free. Hundreds of enslaved Africans came with the migration of United Empire Loyalists in 1783, such as those who arrived in St. Armand, Quebec with Loyalist Phillip Luke. Others, known as Black Loyalists, were freed and brought to Nova Scotia where they established free communities. The Imperial Act of 1790, which encouraged the immigration of more White settlers into British North America, also allowed those settlers to bring their “Negroes, household furniture, utensils of husbandry, or cloathing…” The settlers used enslaved Africans to develop Canada’s agricultural industry– to clear land and plant, cultivate, and harvest crops. Enslaved Africans also worked in various industries and as household servants.<br>  <br>  Because of Canada’s climate of long, cold winters, the duties of enslaved Africans in Canada differed somewhat from those of their Caribbean and American counterparts. The growing season was shorter in Canada, so slaves performed farming activities for a shorter part of the year. The rest of the year enslaved Africans worked as house servants or were hired out by their owners as skilled and unskilled labourers. They also worked in towns and cities in hotels, taverns, and other businesses.<br>  <br>  Enslaved Africans were owned by European|`|kDz9gcMuaa	Plantations there like farms but there not.|`|qb23ebljaa	farms O_O|`|yFwc1RqNaa	there owners farm lands and do crops|`|wVKTIzOEaa	farms?|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Plantations to run the economy.

cyctEPjSaa	Sound like a fun project! Here are some things you could do to spice up your project board:<br>  <br>  1. Take a few pieces of card stock (or regular paper, I suppose) and cut them in half hamburger-style (so the paper is 8.5x5.5). Then you could bend them outwards into half-circles, and paste them near the base of the board (as if they're sitting on the table that the board is sitting on), with the what-would-be-the-diameter-of-the-circle... stuck to the board itself. Then you could take aluminum foil (or anything malleable) and roll it into thin tubes, bending it into a coffee-mug-handle to glue on one side of the half-circle. Now you have a bunch of little coffee-mugs for the base of the poster! With that you can take green pipe cleaners and stick them inside the mugs, taped or glued to the board itself for flower stems. Now, here's where it can get really cool. If you have a few little facts or something short (Q&A's or something), you can use this trick. Draw and cut out paper flowers (the petals and such), and write the question on the front of the flower. Then tape ONLY THE TOP of the flower to the posterboard, so it makes a flap that you can lift up and down (and be sure to put the flower above the stem so that it looks like it is connected). Then you can write the answer to the question beneath the flower on the posterboard!<br>  <br>  2. You could also write the title out with coffee beans, or, if you used idea number 1 (above), then you could do it with pipecleaners to match the flower stems.<br>  <br>  3. If you still have some question-answer type things you'd like to do, or don't like idea number 1, you could take those little coffee packages and wash them out, taping questions to the front and putting the answers in slips of paper inside. That way, to find the answer, you can just pull the paper from the coffee bag. (could also work with seed bags)<br>  <br>  4. If you have a long vine of flowers (fake, of course - could probably get one from Dollar General), then you could tape that to the top of the posterboard.<br>  <br>  5. Just pasting paper flowers and paper coffee mugs that you've drawn or printed off the internet could be a cute effect to place around the board in empty spaces.<br>  <br>  6. If you want to get really complicated, you could start cutting out the papers you printed with the information in the shape of coffee mugs or flower pots.<br>  <br>  Sorry I don't have more ideas than this...I'm not very creative right now. If you have any questions or need help, just send me an email! (padme_amidala_rulz@yahoo.com).

gDADeyAOaa	People often think that The Noble Eightfold Path has to go in consecutive order, as if it were a ladder where the lowest rung of moral conduct makes it possible top get some concentration, which itself leads to insight then wisdom. However, the Noble Eightfold Path shows this to be incorrect. It doesn't start out with moral conduct. It starts out with wisdom. The Noble Eightfold Path has to be looked upon not as a ladder, but as a eight-lane highway on which one has to use all lanes. It's also a circular movement because it starts out and ends with Right View. Although Right View is only mentioned at the beginning, the result of treading the Noble Eightfold Path will be absolute Right View.<br>  <br>  Ajahn Sumedho gives much insight into the Four Noble Truths/Eightfold<br>  Path - on the Website "What Buddha Taught"<br>  <a href="http://what-buddha-taught.net/Books3/Ajahn_Sumedho_The_Four_Noble_Truths.htm" rel="nofollow">http://what-buddha-taught.net/Books3/Aja...</a><br>  <br>  Metta to all.|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	Right effort can be seen as a prerequisite for the other principles of the path. Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved, whereas misguided effort distracts the mind from its task, and confusion will be the consequence. Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states. The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and violence can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty, benevolence, and kindness. Right effort is detailed in four types of endeavours that rank in ascending order of perfection: 1. to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states, 2. to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen, 3. to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen, and 4. to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen.

Since it's a fairy tale, it is more or less timeless, but Barrie wrote the book around 1904, so that would be the time frame I would put it into.<br>  <br>  Characters:<br>  Peter Pan<br>  Wendy<br>  Michael<br>  John<br>  Lost Boys<br>  Hook<br>  Smee<br>  Tiger Lilly<br>  and Tinkerbell of course<br>  maybe the Ticking Crocodile, Wendy's Parents, and Nana, the dog.<br>  <br>  Summary:<br>   The Darling household is a place of joy, consisting of the three children, Wendy, John, and Michael; the practical and sometimes stern father, Mr. Darling; the loving mother, Mrs. Darling; and the children’s nurse, a dog named Nana.<br>  <br>  But sneaking into the children’s bedroom at night to listen to Mrs. Darling’s bedtime stories is Peter Pan. One night, Nana and Mrs. Darling see him and try to stop him, but are only able to catch his shadow as he flies out the window. So they roll it up and put it in a drawer. Peter, of course, wants his shadow, and returns later after Mr. and Mrs. Darling have left for a dinner party. He brings with him his not-very-polite fairy, Tinker Bell. However, when he finds his shadow, he can’t make it stick to him and wakes Wendy as he begins to cry.<br>  <br>  Peter is entranced by Wendy and tells her that he had run away the day he was born because he heard his parents talking about all the things he would do when he was a man, and he went to live with the fairies so that he would never have to grow up. Now he lives in the Neverland with the lost boys, children who fell out of their perambulators and were never found again.<br>  <br>  Wendy sews Peter’s shadow back to him, and then Peter convinces Wendy and her brothers, by teaching them how to fly, to return to the Neverland with him and Tinker Bell. So off they fly, over the rooftops of London to the Neverland, where the lost boys share the island with the mean pirates, led by Captain Hook, and with the very British Picadilly Tribe, led by their chief and princess, Tiger Lily. It was Hook’s greatest desire to capture Peter Pan and his friends because it was Peter who had cut off Hook’s hand and fed it to a crocodile. The crocodile had so liked the taste of the hand that he followed Hook everywhere, waiting for the rest of him. The crocodile had, unhappily, also swallowed a clock, and its ticking warned Hook of any approach.<br>  <br>  To this magical land Wendy and her brothers fly with Peter Pan. The lost boys, seeing Wendy and spurred on by a jealous Tinker Bell, think her a giant bird and shoot her with a bow and arrow. Peter arrives immediately and sees that Wendy is only stunned, and, after banishing Tinker Bell for a week, he tells the others that he has brought Wendy to them. They quickly build her a house and ask her to be their mother. However, Hook and the pirates have their own plans and plant a green poison cake near the new house. The boys, when they find it, are excited and ready to eat it up, but Wendy, the good and wise mother, stops them and puts them to bed, after singing beautiful lullabies.<br>  <br>  The next day, Peter takes Wendy to Marooner’s Rock to see the mermaids. While there, the pirates bring in Tiger Lily, who they have bound and are leaving on the rock to drown at high tide. Peter saves her, and she and the rest of the Picadillies become their friends and guardians.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the children begin to worry about their parents and to feel the pangs of homesickness; and they decide it is time to return to their warm beds in London. The lost boys decide to go with them, but Peter will not hear of going if he will have to grow up. Hook and the pirates, however, foil their plans and capture all the children and take them to their ship. Only Peter, with Tinker Bell’s help, avoids capture.<br>  <br>  The pirates are about to have their captives walk the plank, when Peter arrives and saves them. In the final fight with Hook, Peter forces the pirate captain to the edge of the ship where he hears the ticking of the crocodile and, unnerved, falls into its waiting jaws.<br>  <br>  The three children then return home, along with the lost boys, who the Darlings adopt. Peter stays in the Neverland, coming to visit Wendy on occasion, but she soon turns into an adult and mostly forgets Peter. However, she has a daughter, Jane, who dreams of pirates, Indians, and magical places far away . . .

Quiz questions are based on the main ideas presented in the readings, the class lecture, and discussion of the readings. These questions are drawn from facts, definitions, meaning of concepts, and statement of arguments. Generally, the subject of the quiz is a specific body of acquired information that can be learned by attentive reading, underlining in the text, active listening, and, as a last resort, memorizing. Perhaps, the quiz subjects can be thought of as the passive transference of a set body of information from one source (teacher, reading, or student) to another (student). <br>  <br>  For many people these passive methods are not in themselves exciting and motivating. Self-initiated activity and shared inquiry are much more interesting than reinforced obedience. For this reason, test questions are based on the information learned for quizzes, but go well beyond rote learning. Tests present the opportunity to play with the ideas, relate them to each other, and operate with them. The best way to prepare is by free activity and thinking about the course content. This is probably the only kind of learning which is meaningful and authentic because it relies on your interest and initiative for its own sake. The difference between passive and active learning can be illustrated by the following example question as asked on a test and a quiz. Suppose that ``epistemology'' has been defined as ``the study of the nature, scope, and limits of human knowledge.'' <br>  <br>  <br>  Quiz Questions <br>  What is epistemology? <br>  Epistemology involves the study of knowledge (True / False). <br>  is the discipline concerned with not only what knowledge is but also what can be known. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sample Test Questions <br>  The epistemologist attempts to answer the question: <br>  <br>  a <br>  How do we determine the ultimate nature of reality? <br>  b <br>  What are aesthetics, moral philosophy, and ontology? <br>  c <br>  How do we determine whether our beliefs are true? <br>  d <br>  What is the difference between deduction and induction? <br>  e <br>  What are the ultimate generalizations of the human intellect? <br>  <br>  Explain the nature of epistemology, distinguish the major divisions, and characterize an example of an epistemological problem for each division. <br>  <br>  Do any areas of human inquiry not involve epistemological problems? Explain your reasoning and cite examples wherever possible.|`|LcBYIRjhaa	a quiz is shorter than a test, a test is over the whole chapter a quiz is over a couple pages of the chapter. and i don't know the other answers to your questions, sorry.

LVZdzPmpaa	Onomatopoeia is when a word literally sounds like what it describes.<br>  <br>  "Buzz" has a buzzing sound. <br>  <br>  "Chimes" does indeed mimic the sound of bells.<br>  <br>  "CRASH" sounds just like what it is.<br>  <br>  Tinkling, clanging, hiss, purr, mumble, whirr, boom . . . you get the picture.<br>  <br>  How does a "savage" sound?

I think your teacher thinks the word is "intense" because of its meaning, not the other way around.

You don't walk into a tribal village and hear 'savage' the way you hear 'clunk' when closing a cupboard.|`|CyjuTf0raa	Your English teacher is incorrect. An onomatopoeia is a word that directly means a sound. e.g. fwap, boom, crack, bang.|`|AnHQbZQAaa	your teacher is out to lunch.<br>  <br>  It's from French and Latin; the words it comes from are even less "intense" sounding.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Your teacher is wrong.<br>  <br>  This is the etymology:<br>  c.1300, "wild, undomesticated, untamed" (of animals and places), from O.Fr. sauvage, salvage "wild, savage, untamed," from L.L. salvaticus, alteration of silvaticus "wild," lit. "of the woods," from silva "forest, grove." Of persons, the meaning "reckless, ungovernable" is attested from c.1400l earlier in sense "indomitable, valiant" (c.1300). Implications of ferocity are attested from 1579, earlier of animals (1407). The noun meaning "wild person" is from 1588; the verb meaning "to tear with the teeth, maul" is from 1880.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Since it comes from "silva" meaning "forest" and which does not sound like or imply anything "savage" it is not an onomatopoeia.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I feel like there is another word for what "savage" could be classified poetically . . . but I may just be thinking of consonance.

The phrase was made up in the wonderful book of the same title by James Hellier. It was thought to be impossible to make the book into a film. Yet it was. It could have easily been catch 23 or 24. James used '22' in his book, and the title of the book has become ledgendary and transposed itself into every day conversation.Is there another way of saying it? The answer must be 'NO'. Why? Phrases, from from the works of 'Shakespear' become common parlance and indeed other books. The answer lies is what is 'Catch 22'.<br>  The 'Catch' in the book , which is set in the Meditterrnean during World War  2, and involving American fighter pilots, is that to get<br>   medically discharged from flying missions, you must be insane. However you must be insane to fly in the first place.That is 'Catch 22'. <br>  "One hell of a catch", said Captain Yousarian, to his Medic.<br>  It could have been other numbers, writers have their own thoughts.

A number he just found 'funny'.<br>  In all fainess I think James Hellier said it all, a situation you cannot get out of.

However, contrary to your belief you have plenty of time to bring that up to at least a 3.0 or better to get into a good law school. You do not apply for law school in the Fall of your Junior year, you apply for law school in the Fall of your Senior year. However, you should definitely start studying NOW for the LSAT because this is arguably an even more important factor in law school admissions than your GPA. You should plan to have taken the LSAT by the Summer between your Junior and Senior year. <br>  <br>  Additionally, I strongly agree with some of the other posts. If you have  2.3 now, you need to seriously adjust your professional and academic committment or don't even think about going to law school. The level of work and committment you are putting in with a 2.3 will NOT get you by in law school at all. But Good Luck!|`|U9bQgfY9aa	You need a 3.0 to get into even the most basic state law schools.

This treaty was intended to keep Germany from becoming a military threat to Europe, but actually sowed the seeds for its becoming a reality.

V0DcrdOUaa	Affirmative action is a policy or program for correcting the effects of discrimination. <br>  <br>  Discrimination - the word itself does not really imply anything about majority or minority groups, but when it comes to discriminating on the basis of race, for example, people made up the term "reverse discrimination" to indicate that the discrimination is being enacted against the majority group. <br>  <br>  So, some people would say that "affirmative action" is a FORM of "reverse discrimination."<br>  <br>  (However, some people would disagree and tell you there is no such thing as "reverse discrimination" or that affirmative action is correcting mistakes of the past but is not actually discrimination on its own. Which may be true - it depends on the policy in question.)

6du6kZjmaa	1. There are two types of Euthanasia. One is physician assisted where the patient is too terminal and helpless to do anything for themselves or they are in a coma. The second is them still being terminal, but they can do it for themselves. <br>  2. Voluntary active is taking specific steps to cause the patient's death, such as injecting the patient with poison. In practice, this is usually an overdose of pain-killers or sleeping pills. Or someone who is aware of it.<br>  3. Passive is usually defined as withdrawing medical treatment with the deliberate intention of causing the patient's death. For example, if a patient requires kidney dialysis to survive, and the doctors disconnect the dialysis machine, the patient will presumably die fairly soon. <br>  4. Involuntary would be someone in a coma who is not aware of the euthanasia.<br>  <br>  Legal--- If it is legalize, then it can be regulated.

WHAT IS VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA?<br>  <br>  When we hear the phrase voluntary euthanasia people generally think of one of two things: the active termination of life at the patient's request as it occurs in the Netherlands (or similar proposals in other countries); or the Nazi extermination program of murder. Many people have beliefs about whether euthanasia is right or wrong, often without being able to define it clearly. Some people take an extreme view, while many fall somewhere between the two camps. Dictionary definitions avail us little, as there will always be large groups of people that claim it means something else. The apparent derivation a gentle and easy death (from the Greek, eu - thanatos) hardly describes what we mean. Even extending the definition to include bringing about of this, especially in the case of incurable and painful disease (Oxford English Dictionary) hardly covers it - hospices often succeed in bringing about a peaceful death, but they don't perform euthanasia! <br>  <br>  In the Netherlands, the only country where euthanasia is openly practised, euthanasia is defined as "the intentional termination of life by another at the explicit request of the person who dies" (Netherlands State Commission on Euthanasia). The argument then often centres on the voluntariness of the request. How can one be sure that it is voluntary? Supporters of the voluntary euthanasia movement generally believe that it would be possible to devise sufficient safeguards to ensure that the request was voluntary and that people could never feel pressured<br>  <br>  Reasons given for voluntary euthanasia:<br>  Choice: Proponents of VE emphasize that choice is a fundamental principle for liberal democracies and free market systems.[8] <br>  Quality of Life: The pain and suffering a person feels during a disease, even with pain relievers, can be incomprehensible to a person who has not gone through it. Even without considering the physical pain, it is often difficult for patients to overcome the emotional pain of losing their independence. [8] <br>  Economic costs and human resources: Today in many countries there is a shortage of hospital space. The energy of doctors and hospital beds could be used for people whose lives could be saved instead of continuing the life of those who want to die which increases the general quality of care and shortens hospital waiting lists. It is a burden to keep people alive past the point they can contribute to society, especially if the resources used could be spent on a curable ailment.[37] <br>  <br>  Reasons given against voluntary euthanasia:<br>  Professional role: Critics argue that voluntary euthanasia could unduly compromise the professional roles of health care employees, especially doctors. They point out that European physicians of previous centuries traditionally swore some variation of the Hippocratic Oath, which in its ancient form excluded euthanasia: "To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.." However, since the 1970s, this oath has largely fallen out of use. <br>  Moral: Some people consider euthanasia of s
T17pbHVJaa	The dithyramb was originally an ancient Greek hymn (διθ?ραμβο? - dithurambos) sung to the god Dionysus and was also a term used as an epithet of the god.[1]. Its wild and ecstatic character was contrasted by Plutarch[2] with that of the paean. Dithyrambos seems to have arisen out of this song: just as paean was both a hymn to and a title of Apollo, Dithyrambos was an epithet of Dionysus as well as a song in his honor. Greeks recognized in the epithet "he of the miraculous birth" and constructed an etymology to confirm this.[3] According to Aristotle, the dithyramb was the origin of the Ancient Greek theatre, and one may recognize as a dithyramb the chorus invoking Dionysus in Euripides' The Bacchae.[4] Plato, in The Laws, discussing various kinds of music, mentions "the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb".[5]

T17pbHVJaa	Time is a component of the measuring system used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify the motions of objects. Time has been a major subject of religion, philosophy, and science, but defining time in a non-controversial manner applicable to all fields of study has consistently eluded the greatest scholars.<br>  <br>  In physics and other sciences, time is considered one of the few fundamental quantities.<br>  <br>  Among prominent philosophers, there are two distinct viewpoints on time. One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a dimension in which events occur in sequence. Time travel, in this view, becomes a possibility as other "times" persist like frames of a film strip, spread out across the time line. Sir Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Time, like gravity, is a non physical condition in which mass changes and evolves.<br>  <br>  Although we have invented a method to measure time, as we have with gravity, there is no tangible element that one can point to and call that "time".<br>  <br>  For humans, time is linear. Time is effected by gravity (slows down). Science suggests that if one could enter into a black hole, time would virtually stand still due to the massive amounts of gravity.

AA10393340	Put this in your own words:-<br>  <br>  In Friar Lawrence’s cell, Romeo is overcome with grief, and wonders what sentence the Prince has decreed. Friar Lawrence tells him he is lucky: the prince has only banished him. Romeo claims that banishment is a penalty far worse than death, since he will have to live, but without Juliet. The friar tries to counsel Romeo but the youth is so unhappy that he will have none of it. Romeo falls to the floor. The Nurse arrives, and Romeo desperately asks her for news of Juliet. He assumes that Juliet now thinks of him as a murderer and threatens to stab himself. Friar Lawrence stops him and scolds him for being unmanly. He explains that Romeo has much to be grateful for: he and Juliet are both alive, and after matters have calmed down, Prince Escalus might change his mind. The friar sets forth a plan: Romeo will visit Juliet that night, but make sure to leave her chamber, and Verona, before the morning. He will then reside in Mantua until news of their marriage can be spread. The Nurse hands Romeo the ring from Juliet, and this physical symbol of their love revives his spirits. The Nurse departs, and Romeo bids Friar Lawrence farewell. He must prepare to visit Juliet and then flee to Mantua.|`|mwXuB4tIaa	Short answer:<br>  Learning from the Friar that he is to be banished, Romeo declares that the Friar is torturing him to death, then throws himself on the floor, moaning and weeping. <br>  The Nurse brings news that Juliet is in just as bad shape as Romeo. Romeo, wild with guilt at the pain he has caused Juliet, tries to stab himself. Friar Laurence lectures Romeo and tells him what to do -- go to Juliet, then to Mantua until the Prince can be persuaded to pardon him. The Nurse gives Romeo the ring that Juliet asked her to take to him. These things put Romeo into a better frame of mind and he leaves Friar Laurence's cell to go to Juliet.<br>  <br>  Long answer: see the website cited

J4cSgIreaa	The cranial nerves are composed of twelve pairs of nerves that emanate from the nervous tissue of the brain.  In order reach their targets they must ultimately exit/enter the cranium through openings in the skull.  Hence, their name is derived from their association with the cranium.  The function of the cranial nerves is for the most part similar to the spinal nerves, the nerves that are associated with the spinal cord.  The motor components of the cranial nerves are derived from cells that are located in the brain.  These cells send their axons (bundles of axons outside the brain = a nerve) out of the cranium where they will ultimately control muscle (e.g., eye movements) , glandular tissue (e.g., salivary glands) or specialized muscle (e.g., heart or stomach). The sensory components of cranial nerves originate from collections of cells that are located outside the brain. These collections of nerve cells bodies are called  sensory ganglia. They are essentially the same functionally and anatomically as the dorsal root ganglia which are associated with the spinal cord.  In general, sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves send out a branch that divides into two branches: a branch that enters the brain and one that is connected to a sensory organ. Examples of sensory organs are pressure or pain sensors in the skin and more specialized ones such as taste receptors of the tongue. Electrical impulses are transmitted from the sensory organ through the ganglia and into the brain via the sensory branch that enter the brain.  There are two exceptions to this rule that should be noted when the special senses of smell and vision are discussed.  In summary, the motor components  of cranial nerves transmit nerve impulses from the brain to target tissue outside of the brain.  Sensory components transmit nerve impulses from sensory organs to the brain. <br>  <br>  All the information you will need on cranial nerves is in the two links the second link has very good diagrams too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.med.yale.edu/caim/cnerves/" rel="nofollow">http://www.med.yale.edu/caim/cnerves/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/h_n/cn/cn1/mainframe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/G...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck

a3906a15682d2ea1f447780889cfbb8faa	Actually, I believe it is correct, and is not a result of sloppy or modern usage.  I read somewhere (not Y/A) that this impersonal  use of 'they' (neither male nor female, neither singular nor plural) is very ancient in English, maybe going back to Saxon times.  Other languages and literary English will use "one" to express this idea, but that doesn't sound natural in most spoken contexts.|`|krpSGkDWaa	Spoken English is much less formal than written so you can sometimes bend the rules; in your case, bending them makes perfect sense although it's not really grammatically correct. One way to avoid the whole issue is to simply say "...but my company isn't here yet so why don't you come over for a few minutes".|`|AtwxEl9Jaa	No.<br>  <br>  Obviously, using "they" to mean one person of either sex is common now when speaking, however, it's not grammatically correct. I wouldn't really say that it matters when you're speaking, but it definitely matters when you're writing. Despite popular usage, "they" always refers to multiple people, if it's only one person you can either say "he," "she," or "one," but not "they".<br>  <br>  So basically, yes that was incorrect, but it's not a big deal when speaking.

Led by Vasco da Gama's landing at Calicut in 1498, they established themselves along the Malabar Coast, trading with the rest of the subcontinent from there. (The Portuguese maintained some holdings in India as late as 1961.) <br>  <br>  The English<br>  In 1600, the British East India Company was given the right to a monopoly to trade with India. While the company's primary objective was to get spices from Indonesia (East Indies), they needed goods to trade for spices. The good they wanted was cotton, and they got it from India. In 1612, the English won a battle against the Portuguese. Because of this victory, they were able to gain the right to trade and establish factories in India from the Mughal Emporer. Because the Dutch controlled the East Indies, the English focused all their attention on India. The company traded for silk, sugar, and opium among other goods. <br>  The French<br>  In 1664, French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert launched the French equivalent of the English East India Trading Company. The French obtained a few cities such as Pondicherry and Chandernagore, and gradually expanded their trade. By 1740, however, this company's sales were only half those of the English East India Company.<br>  Others<br>  The Danish, the Austrians, the Swedes, and the Prussians all tried unsuccessfully to get a piece of the action in India. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The British and French Battle for Control of India<br>  <br>  When Frederick II of Prussia siezed Silesia in 1740, France sided with him, the British with Austria. As a result of this, The War of Austrian Succession, the British decided that France's power in India was too great to be left alone. After the French quickly cornered the English in a naval battle, a treaty was signed trading Madras for Cape Breton Island in North America. <br>  <br>  Relations between the British and French worsened as each became mired in local Indian politics. After the nizam, a major Mughal noble and power-broker, died, the French took advantage of this time to pick sides in a dispute over who would be Karnatic nawab (governor). (Karnataka was a dependancy of the nizam. The nizam chose a nawab in 1743, but rivals for the nawab-ate weren't satisfied. Is this clear? Good.) The French chose Chanda Sahib for nawab and Salabat Jang for nizam. The British, not to be outdone, responded by saying that Muhammad Ali (the Indian, not the boxer) should be nawab.<br>  <br>  The nawab-ship wasn't really all that important, but it made a good excuse for a war. The British/Muhammad Ali, led by Robert Clive, gained control of Arcot (the capital of Karnataka) in 1751, and the French/Chandra Sahib were forced to surrended in 1752.<br>  <br>  Peace and tranquility reigned for . . . four years. Then, the Seven Years' War began in Europe in 1756, and the British and French in India were at it again. The British, with their naval superiority, won victories in the Bengal, at Madras, at Ponicherry, and at Wandiwash. The French surrendered for the second time in 1761.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Rise of the English East India Company<br>  <br>  In 1786, Lord Cornwallis became British governor of Inida. He strengthened the sepoy armies that the East India Company had raised. Also, under Cornwallis and his successor Lord Wellesley, the British slowly expanded their holdings. In 1813, the monopoly of the English East India Company was broken and all British citizens were allowed to trade with India. Over the next 30 years, the British continued to acquire new lands and strengthen their grip on those already under their rule. <br>  <br>  From 1838 until 1857, however, the British were weakened by the failure of their attempts to keep Russia out of Afghanistan. The defeat of the British in the First Afghan War caused the Indians to become aware that the British were not invincible. However, the British continued to annex more Indian territory throughout the 1850's.<br>  <br>  The British also aggravated the Hindu population of India during this time period. They made English, instead of Persian, the official language. They prohibited suttee (in which Hindu widows threw themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres) and infanticide. They also allowed Hindu widows to remarry and sanctioned missionary activity. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Sepoy Mutiny<br>  <br>  The growing Indian discontent with British rule erupted on May 10, 1857. The sepoys, who were Indians trained by the British as soldiers, heard rumors that the cartridges for their new Enfield rifles were greased with lard and beef fat. Since the cow is sacred to Hindus, and the pig is abhorrent to Muslims, all the sepoys were outraged, and they mutinied.

o3Jpfflgaa	This is commonly called The Transfiguration of Jesus.  The primary meaning was (and is) to demonstrate that Jesus is truly the Son of God.  God manifested (made plain) a small part of His Glory in making Jesus' clothing blindingly white.  God also gave the testimony the He is the God of the living by having Moses and Elijah appear and speak with Jesus.<br>  <br>  Another main point was to demonstrate to the disciples that Jesus could be believed in what He said to them.  Finally, Jesus told them to tell no one what had happened until after His crucifixion and resurrectioin.  The intent of that so that the Apostles word would be even more credible and give weight to their testimony that Jesus is indeed the Son of God.

Free trade. Development. Rights and Freedoms - that is the good legacy of Imperialism on Canada.<br>  <br>  Many of our institutions - particularly our government, hark back to the days of the Empire. <br>  <br>  <br>  When you do your newscast, remember; to ignore the history of an Imperial Canada would not only blind us to the tragedies of the past and risk them occuring again, but we would also be turning our backs on the roots of tradition, democracy and the freedom we enjoy in this country.<br>  <br>  By responding to our Imperial history, we can see the atrocities that were committed for various causes. But I believe too much emphasis is placed upon these events - or rather, not enough emphasis is placed on how we overcame and conquered these pitfalls in our history.

Undaunted, he resumed his studies at The University of Nebraska and earned a bootstrap degree in 1969.  He accepted a position as Facility Engineer in Bangkok, Thailand where he managed some 3800 people.

Hoe7sJM4aa	1) Pages 1-9 are single digits, so that's 9 and then subtract 9 from 192<br>  192 - 9 = 183<br>  <br>  2) Now, pages 10-99 are double digits, so lets find out how many digits that could possibly equal.<br>  90 (99 - 10 = 89 plus 1 because of the way subtraction is done) (number of two digit numbers) x 2 = 180<br>  <br>  3) So because 180 (the number of digits from the two digit numbers) does not equal 183 (the number of digits remaining after subtraction nine), we need to subtract to find the difference and how many digits are left.<br>  183 - 180 = 3<br>  <br>  4) Now because we only have three digit numbers left to use, we only have the number 100 (which represents the number of pages in the book)which adds up all the digits to 183. So there are 100 pages in the book.|`|AA10148570	This is the only way I make sense of it so far. Numbers 0 through 9 have one digit each, then 10 through 99 have two digits each, then 100 through 999 have three digits each, and so on.

Well, 100 has three digits, but we could start counting from 1 instead of 0, to make room in our final sum for the extra digit. So Norma's book has 100 pages. Cool!|`|RtM36z3Zaa	It said digits, not numbers.<br>  <br>  Digits are how many numbers are in your number.<br>  <br>  3 has one digit<br>  33 has two digits<br>  333 has three digits<br>  <br>  So, page one has one digit,<br>  page two has one digit,<br>  page ten has two digits,<br>  page twenty has two digits,<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  So, you would have to count up all of the digits, page by page, until you have 192 counted up.<br>  <br>  That's how you do it! Hope it helps!|`|h1iSYPOsaa	the only way it works is if you include zero as one of the digits other wise you will end up one short so it takes 100 digits to do it :)

RAxSichXaa	I think you are asking "What the heck am I supposed to do?"  So I will help you with a couple to show you and the you are on your own. OK?  You are supposed to solve using multiplication and addition to eliminate one unknown so you can solve for the other.<br>  <br>  A)  5x - 2y = 4<br>       3x + y = 9    multiply this equation by two and add it to the top equation, I chose this equation and  two as a multiplier because when the result is added to the first equation the unknown y will cancel out.<br>  <br>  So, 2(3x+y=9) gives you  6x +2y = 18   now we add it to the first equation:<br>  <br>  5x+6x -2y +2y = 4 +18<br>  <br>  11x = 22,  x = 2    now substitute 2 for x in one of the two original equations, I will pick the second one because it is simpler, but either will do.<br>  <br>  3(2) +y = 9,  y = 9 - 6 = 3    Now you have x = 2 and y = 3.  expressed like a coordinate pair that means (2,3).  If you look at the word list for (2,3) you will see that it corresponds to the word  "THE".  So if you have a box labeled "A" then the word "THE" goes into it.<br>  <br>  B)  Multiply bottom equation by -3 and add the two equations, solve for y<br>  <br>  C) multiply top equation by 2 and add, solve for x.<br>  <br>  Each of the solution pairs should correspond to a word.

eLa3ldTkaa	This is actually a philosophy question.  <br>  <br>  The right way to respond to any statement that says that something is not true is to find an example, any example, that defies the statement.  Now all you have to do is find an example of any multi-celled organism that can reproduce asexually.<br>  <br>  One suggestion is any one of several plants that reproduce through shoots or runners.  Another is to identify that kind of lizard that can reproduce without mating.  There are also some very small organisms (flatworms and such) that can reproduce without mating.  <br>  <br>  Find examples, refute the argument.|`|FoFvHsjiaa	Well some plants and fungi reproduce asexually and they are multicellular, so the first part of the question is false|`|msxGICJvaa	Just tell her and stop what she said and tell her to look it up.|`|ymH78A3zaa	the first part is like a true or false question. the second part is why! so think of it as:<br>  <br>  Can a multicellular organism reproduce asexually? why, give examples.<br>  <br>  do a little research and its easy!<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_rep...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|KzLupcK5aa	most single-celled organisms reproduce through binarry fission, a process where the cell splits into two and continues to split. If a multicellular organism were to perform such a feat, there would be multiples of me and you...freaky|`|OFr5Z8zNaa	I think by Biary Fussion, Sexually reproduce|`|NksaA5mvaa	I would hit her over the head with my biology book...<br>  <br>  No really.. uhm.. where to begin.<br>  Most single-celled organisms reproduce by a process known as fission, in which the parent organism splits into two or more so-called daughter organisms, thereby losing its original identity. Cell division, which results in the multiplication of cells constituting the tissues, organs, and systems of a multicellular organism, is not considered true reproduction; it is almost identical, however, with the binary fission of single-celled organisms. In certain multicellular animals, such as the cnidarians, sponges, and tunicates, cell division often results in the production of buds that arise from the body of the parent and then later separate to develop into a new organism identical with the parent; this process, known as gemmation, is analogous to the process of vegetative reproduction or propagation in plants. Reproductive processes such as those cited above, in which only one parent gives rise to the offspring, are scientifically classified as asexual reproduction. The offspring produced are identical with the parent.A number of single-celled organisms multiply by conjugation. In this process, which is analogous to fertilization, two similar unicellular organisms fuse, exchange nuclear materials, and then break apart. Each organism then reproduces by fission; occasionally, after conjugation, the participating organisms do not reproduce, the process in these instances seeming merely to revitalize the organisms. Conjugation is the most primitive method of sexual reproduction by which organisms having genetic characteristics derived from two parents are produced. Most multicellular animals and plants undergo a more complex form of sexual reproduction in which especially differentiated male and female reproductive cells (gametes) unite to form a single cell, known as a zygote, which later undergoes successive divisions to form a new organism. The terms fecundation and fertilization are applied to the union of the male and female cells. In this form of sexual reproduction, half the genes, the carriers of inheritable characteristics, in the zygote come from one parent and half from the other parent.|`|Z65KWSInaa	I'd tell that friend that he/she is incorrect.  Many plants and fungi reproduce asexually.  Many invertebrates, such as the cape bee and many aphids (bugs), and some vertebrates reproduce asexually.

There is also vegatative and spore reproduction.|`|q536TZRFaa	wait, is your friend a nerd trying to have sex with u, maybe he/she is trying to imply, only single celled organisms can reproduce asexually, so don't try it, do it with him/her.|`|HReTc9J5aa	I think the question is asking why multicellular organisms can't reproduce asexually.|`|on9TXr5Saa	If it's so easy why can't you do it?|`|jyVqvRxHaa	if you could have sex with yourself

MFLyDPWtaa	I'm 34 years old, and I currently live in a big city, and I want to keep it that way. The reason? There are lots of different activities to do in a big city. I don't go out much, but I like having the option of a lot of things to do and places to go. I think I would get bored and lonely in a small city. I think that when I'm older (50s or 60s) I'll probably want to live in a small city or in a town, but as for now, big cities are for me.|`|6e2bc5d97fc9bb10a6f05dc6ba70a570aa	I would prefer a small city. Bigger city's are noisy, over populated, traffic, you don't have space to just enjoy nature. Some bigger city's are nice but smaller one's seem to be more "Friendly" and cleaner. It's nice to be able to go out side and here nothing but the wind and birds (and a few cars, lol). Its nice to have a yard, woods, etc. I'm not sure if I helped any, this is just my opinion. : - D<br>  <br>  <br>  Which do you prefer?
AA12185864	In Homeric legend Aphrodite was forced to marry the ugly god of fire, Hephaestus, with this marriage, she had hoped to reach the freedom she needed instead of being controlled. Aphrodite was very independent and constantly in search for a new lover. One of her more familiar lovers was Ares, the god of war, whom she later married. Aphrodite felt no pain in being deceitful, as she flourished in the fact that she could have anyone and everyone, love and admire her. Aphrodite has had many miscellaneous children as a result of her whimsical affairs, but a few of her more familiar ones are, Eros(god of Love), Rhodos, Herophilus, Hermaphroditus, Priapus, and Aneas<br>  <a href="http://www.arthistory.sbc.edu/imageswomen/papers/parisaphrodite/aphrodite.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.arthistory.sbc.edu/imageswome...</a>

Also, at most colleges and universities, your chances of getting in as a freshman applicant are higher than getting in as a transfer (10% vs 1.5% at Stanford, for example).

I really wanted to study German. I'm not sure why, but I've always liked it. I was either German in a past life, or watched too many WW2 movies growing up. Anyway, it wasn't available in my school. For me it was French (YUCK), or Espanol. What your paernts are telling you is correct. There are many more Spanish-speaking people throughout the world. It is the second most popular language on the planet, w/dialects of course. I'm very good w/languages. I have picked up some German over the years. I am bi-lingual w/Spanish, mainly because I learned the basics in public school. It's very useful to me now as an RN. What I would advise you to do. Especially if you've a mind to go into the business sector. Is to learn Chinese. There is going to be a big demand for business professionals who are bilingual English/Chinese.
