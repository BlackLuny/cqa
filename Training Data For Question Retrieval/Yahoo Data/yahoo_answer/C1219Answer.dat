Antonio Puerta, futbolista internacional del Sevilla de 22 a?os, falleci ayer alrededor de las 14.30 horas en el Hospital Virgen del Roco de la capital andaluza despus de tres noches de agona, a causa del paro cardiaco que sufri durante el partido Sevilla-Getafe del pasado sbado. A la media hora del encuentro, Puerta cay al csped, junto a la portera de Palop, y fue inmediatamente auxiliado por su compa?ero Dragutinovic, que le sac la lengua para evitar que se asfixiase.     Recuperado en primera instancia, el futbolista internacional abandon el campo por su propio pie, no sin antes lamentar su mala suerte por tener que ser suplido por el portugus Duda. Ya en el vestuario, Puerta volvi a desvanecerse, por lo que los mdicos del club decidieron trasladarlo a un centro hospitalario, donde, pasadas las dos de la madrugada, se inform de que haba sufrido un paro cardiaco y que se mantena sedado y con ayuda mecnica para respirar. El primer parte mdico rezaba que Puerta haba ingresado con ?pronstico muy grave? despus de sufrir ?una parada cardiorrespiratoria? que haba requerido unas ?maniobras de reanimacin avanzadas?. Durante la noche, Puerta sufri media docena de paros cardiacos ms y el parte del domingo por la ma?ana repeta el pronstico, aunque a?ada que el futbolista padeca ?inestabilidad hemodinmica?.     El tercer parte mdico, el ltimo que fue ledo por los responsables del hospital, informaba que el lunes por la ma?ana Puerta haba sufrido ?una parada cardiaca prolongada? que haba causado ?da?os cerebrales?. Desde la ma?ana de ayer se saba que la situacin de Puerta era crtica y, de hecho, el ltimo parte mdico, facilitado al medioda, hablaba de estado ?muy crtico? y de posible ?fallo multiorgnico?, lo que haca prever el fatal desenlace. Lo inevitable. A las tres de la tarde hora espa?ola, Jos Mara del Nido abandonaba el hotel de concentracin del Sevilla en Atenas para solicitar la suspensin del partido al delegado de la UEFA, lo que prcticamente supona una constatacin de lo inevitable. Alrededor de 300 personas se congregaban a las 18.30 horas en las puertas del Hospital Virgen del Roco de Sevilla. Los aficionados, muy afectados por la noticia, tuvieron que ser desalojados del vestbulo del hospital para no entorpecer las labores de los sanitarios, tras lo que se trasladaron a las puertas del centro, donde corearon lemas y portaron pancartas en honor de Puerta e hicieron ondear bufandas y banderas sevillistas.    En fin Otra vida que se va, pero otra vida llegara en 2 meses...

CYtMRC4eaa	I'll go with (c).|`|bqoEOO8Waa	The answer is C.    The main reason for genetic recombination is for variation of traits so that there will be some individuals which will be selected for when there is a change in the environment. There will be selection for the fittest and hence survival of the species.    In the event that there is no variation among the species, any change in the environment that is unfavourable to them will cause the ENTIRE population to be completely wiped out since they all have the same set of genes.    Hence, genetic recombination is extremely important.:)      Through this genetic variation and selection for survival, there is evolution of the species over a long period of time.|`|cP4RFVu8aa	b) evolution

CYtMRC4eaa	You might call anyone NOT albino melanistic, because they produce melanin..  Perhaps you might call members of two of the human subspecies, Negroidea and Australoidea, melanistic because they are so dark.    There are probably albino lions somewhere.    I don't think a black cat would be called melanistic. since black is the color of the fur, and not the tissue.
wJTsifugaa	When you change the temperature or pressure of a liquid-vapor system at equilibrium, you will change the equilibrium.  When the temperature is increased, a new equilibrium will be established at an increased pressure, with some of the liquid vaporizing to increase the density of the vapor (assuming the amount of mass is constant).    The opposite will happen if the temperature is decreased, the equilibrium pressure will be lower with some vapor condensing to liquid.
u0udwkZQaa	Pollination is when you put the male spores (pollen) onto the female stamen. It's fertilisation when the two gametes actually fuse. Basically, you would expect fertilisation to occur after pollination, but it's not guaranteed. Think of it in terms of sex in humans. The pollination could be the act of sex itself, involving the deposition of sperm into the vagina. However, fertilisation won't happen unless one of those sperms meets and fuses with the egg. You can have sex, but it doesn't mean you are going to always be pregnant. Likewise, you can pollinate flowers, but the fertilisation won't always work. It's much more likely to happen in plants than humans though, because plants release pollen when it is the right season for plants to be pollinated and fertilised. Humans have sex whenever they like, and not just because they think it's a good time to have a baby.|`|AA11783156	pollination is the transferral of pollen (think of this as sperm) to the stigma (think of this as a vagina and consider this as plants having sex)  Fertilisation is when the pollen actually joins with ovules (think of this as a woman's eggs and of her getting pregnant!)

The same thing that "conventional" farmers use.    Certain organic-approved chemical controls (typically biocontrol agents) are used.    Chemical controls are infrequently used for bacteria.  Resistance is by far the most important control method.  And bacteria certainly cause many economically important plant diseases.    Economics is actually one of the most important factors in determining whether chemicals are applied.  A farmer isn't going to use pesticides (or fertilizers for that matter) if he isn't going to recover the cost.

VkCrdtJkaa	Planets are formed from dust in space.  The dust forms a ball and gathers up more dust until you have a planet.  Gravity keeps the ball together.  The dust for planets is formed from star explosions which created the heavier elements.  That is why we have Carbon, Gold, Iron, and a lot of other elements on earth.  The earth didn't make these things, they were in the dust that formed us.  Other balls in space are formed from a different mixture of elements and turn into giant balls that are mostly gas or stars.  It depends on the stuff that formed you and how big you got.

ossCVxPqaa	The pressure at any depth below the surface of a liquid is given by:   P = d*g*h where d= density of liquid, g = acceleration due to gravity, and d is the depth below surface. For a given set of tests, d and g are constants, so the pressure will vary directly with the depth below the surface. The other dimensions of the container such as width and breadth play no part in the pressure.|`|AA11821715	Be more specific with your question. A smaller container can hold a greater pressure because there is less surface area, so there cannot be as many PSI's, punds per square inch. Water pressure in a closed container is directly related to temperature.|`|X9BAbTQbaa	Like the first answerer said a little more detail would be handy. Assuming pressure to be at a fixed amount (arbitrary) The size of the vessel in surface area as it increases will increase the actual force exerted on periphery, with that in mind this will test the limits of the material it is made of. The shape that is usually the best for this is a sphere although mother nature has been using the egg shape for millions of years with great success. That is no doubt to do with creature comforts more than anything else. By having a shape other than the ones mentioned you must introduce an angle and for containing or resisting pressure this is a weak point.  If you look at most man made pressure vessels, for internal or external, they are almost universally round in their major structural design. Eg's like subs, air tanks, gas bottles and so on. The shape is not the best for making the best use of area, however it is the best that we know of so far. Basic rule bigger pressure thicker and or stronger material.  Edit: Having said the above I now see your update and still don't know all of the parameters that are involved! The only thing i will add is shape does not determine how far the water will squirt, pressure and hole size along with the volume of pressure available will effect the outcome.

A 12-Step Program  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-...    How To Install Software: A 12-Step Program    1. Examine the software packaging until you find a little  printed box that explains what kind of computer system you  need to run the software. It should look something like  this:    SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  2386 PROCESSOR OR HIGHER  628.8 MEGAHERTZ MODEM  719.7 MB FREE DISK SPACE  3546 MB RAM  432323 MB ROM  05948737 MB RPM  ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM  2 TURTLE DOVES  NOTE: This software will not work on your computer.    2. Open the software packaging and remove the manual. This  will contain detailed instructions on installing, operating,  and trouble-shooting the software. Throw it away.    3. Find the actual software, which should be in the form of  either a 3.5-inch floppy diskette or a CD-ROM, located  inside a sealed envelope that says:    LICENSING AGREEMENT: By breaking this seal, the user  hereinafter agrees to abide by all the terms and conditions  of the following agreement that nobody ever reads, as well  as the Geneva Convention and the U.N. Charter and the Secret  Membership Oath of the Benevolent Protective Order of the  Elks and such other terms and conditions, real and  imaginary, as the Software Company shall deem necessary and  appropriate, including the right to come to the user's home  and examine the user's hard drive, as well as the user's  underwear drawer if we feel like it, take it or leave it,  until death do us part, one nation indivisible, by the  dawn's early light,...finders keepers, losers weepers,  thanks you've been a great crowd, and don't forget to tip  your servers.    4. Hand the software to a child aged 3 through 12 and say,  "(Name of child), please install this on my computer."    5. If you have no child age 3 through 12, insert the  software in the appropriate drive, type "SETUP" and press  the Enter key.    6. Turn the computer on, you idiot.    7. Once again type "SETUP" and press the Enter key.    8. You will hear grinding and whirring noises for a while,  after which the following message should appear on your  screen:    The Installation Program will now examine your system to see  what would be the best way to render it inoperable. Is it OK  with you? Choose one, and be honest:    +---------+ +-----------+  | YES | | SURE |  +---------+ +-----------+    9. After you make your selection, you will hear grinding and  whirring for a very long time while the installation program  does who knows what in there. Some installation programs can  actually alter molecular structures, so that when they're  done, your computer has been transformed into an entirely  new device, such as a food processor. At the very least,  the installation program will create many new directories,  sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, on your hard drive and  fill them with thousands of mysterious files with names like  "puree.exe," "fester.dat," and "doo.wha."    10. When the installation program is finished, your screen  should display the following message:    CONGRATULATIONS    The installation program cannot think of anything else to do  to your computer and has grown bored. You may now attempt to  run your software.    If you experience any problems, electrical shocks, insomnia,  shortness of breath, nasal discharge, or intestinal  parasites,you should immediately swear, like this:  *!@!$)$%@&*^)$*! $_$*^&    11. At this point your computer system should become less  functional than the federal government, refusing to respond  even when struck with furniture.    12. Call the toll-free Technical Support Hotline number  listed on the package and wait on the line for a  representative, who will explain to you, in a clear,  step-by-step manner, how to adopt a child aged 3 through 12.      And so that's the easy way to install software...    ____________________ ____________________ __________  did you know these facts?        Indecision is the key to flexibility.

V8jIAEmBaa	You and your friend have different understandings of the definition of specific heat capacity.    Steam has slightly lower specific heat (depending on pressure, temperature, and grade of oil) than oil (call it 2 vs. 2.4), because increasing temp of 1 kg of it by 1C takes less heat than for oil.    However, when water is converted to steam, it requires considerable heat of fusion to vaporize, thus, the steam, considering the phase change, is far more effective at heat transfer than is hot oil.    There are several specific heat capacity values; Cp, Cv, etc. This article explains but stumbles some over nomenclature.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_he...|`|157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	oil has a lower specific heat capacity, even though the heat transfer of steam comes mainly from the latent heat of vaporization released when it condenses to water and not the sp. heat.|`|KqC8pGfvaa	water|`|Gt5JzC2Daa	Specific heat is "Energy needed for a unit temp rise per amount of substance WITHOUT a phase change" (amount of substance here is usually mass). Fairly sure steam has a higher specific heat than oil. But remember that steam usually has a fairly low density, which might mean a given volume of oil carries/transfers more heat per unit volume.    Heat transfer is largely controlled by the temperature difference between the inside/outside of a pipe (there's also transfer coefficients). hot steam is usually hotter than hot oil. Also if the steam condenses you get the latent heat of vaporisation "back" without a temperature drop.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_...
TKHHRUB4aa	Although "biotechnology" and "genetic modification" commonly are used interchangeably, GM is a special set of technologies that alter the genetic makeup of organisms such as animals, plants, or bacteria. Biotechnology, a more general term, refers to using organisms or their components, such as enzymes, to make products that include wine, cheese, beer, and yogurt.     Combining genes from different organisms is known as recombinant DNA technology, and the resulting organism is said to be "genetically modified," "genetically engineered," or "transgenic." GM products (current or those in development) include medicines and vaccines, foods and food ingredients, feeds, and fibers.     Locating genes for important traitssuch as those conferring insect resistance or desired nutrientsis one of the most limiting steps in the process. However, genome sequencing and discovery programs for hundreds of organisms are generating detailed maps along with data-analyzing technologies to understand and use them.     In 2006, 252 million acres of transgenic crops were planted in 22 countries by 10.3 million farmers. The majority of these crops were herbicide- and insect-resistant soybeans, corn, cotton, canola, and alfalfa. Other crops grown commercially or field-tested are a sweet potato resistant to a virus that could decimate most of the African harvest, rice with increased iron and vitamins that may alleviate chronic malnutrition in Asian countries, and a variety of plants able to survive weather extremes.     On the horizon are bananas that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B; fish that mature more quickly; cows that are resistant to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease); fruit and nut trees that yield years earlier, and plants that produce new plastics with unique properties.     In 2006, countries that grew 97% of the global transgenic crops were the United States (53%), Argentina (17%), Brazil (11%), Canada (6%), India (4%), China (3%), Paraguay (2%) and South Africa (1%). Although growth is expected to plateau in industrialized nations, it is increasing in developing countries. The next decade will see exponential progress in GM product development as researchers gain increasing and unprecedented access to genomic resources that are applicable to organisms beyond the scope of individual projects.     Technologies for genetically modifying foods offer dramatic promise for meeting some of the 21st Century's greatest challenges. Like all new technologies, they also pose some risks, both known and unknown. Controversies surrounding GM foods and crops commonly focus on human and environmental safety, labeling and consumer choice, intellectual property rights, ethics, food security, poverty reduction, and environmental conservation (see GM Products: Benefits and Controversies, below).       Click the link below for more information.  Hopefully, this would give you a lot of answers to your question.

I'm not sure about this... but if i had to make a good guess i would say::  i dont think there is an antibiotic that kill all the bacteria.  But, i think... antibodies can be general for a large group such as say Gramnegative bacteria (e. coli, salmonala).  Because the bacterial cells surface is so different from our cells, for instence they have cell wall and peptidoglycan on the cell surface, antibodies can be made to kill (or be killed by the immune cells.) and not our cells.|`|065c4ccb1266446bb12d60c809e0641daa	most antibiotics prevent peptidoglycan synthesis.  Peptidoglycan is a very important part of the bacterial cell wall, and if it is inhibited (by antibiotics) then bacteria cannot reproduce.  So in essence, antibiotics prevent bacteria from multiplying.    This doesn't harm eukaryotic (human) cells because our cells do not have a cell wall, and therefore, have no need for peptidoglycan synthesis.|`|b6bb1db31e9d61caa74393a8453cbf5caa	Different antibiotics have different modes of action. They are highly specific and several antibiotics are isolated from bacteria! If you look at the architecture of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the macinery that they have to make biomolecules differ significantly even though perform same or similar functions. Antibiotics selectively target one but not the other. For example, the cell wall is a unique structure in bacteria that is absent in higher eukaryotic cells. Thus, penicillin that acts on bacteria is targetless in human cells. If you look at the machinery (ribosomes) that synthesizes proteins in bacteria is slightly different from that in eukaryotes. We have antibiotics that can selectively target one but not the other.

Asi que por lo tanto los hombres por no pensar antes, pierden a?os de expectativa de vida, conclision final la cultura machista los ha hecho asi... asi que mi hipotesis es que el machismo no es solo contraproducente, sino que puede matar... jejejeje..... y cuando estamos al frente de hombres que no piensan en lo que hacen y se deja llevar por el instinto....|`|AA11902003	Esto es debido a los estrgenos!

Los estrgenos, manitienen  la estructura normal de la piel y vasos sanguneos en mujeres, disminuyen el ndice de resorcin de hueso al antagonizar el efecto de la hormona paratiroidea (PTH); Es decir evitan que el hueso se descalsifique.

3GHXk05saa	The Nitrogen in the soil is as an atom attached to a larger molecule and can be accessed by the plant, like ammonia. Nitrogen in the air is N2 and very difficult to separate the atoms and does not get stuck in the soil, it needs to be 'fixed' by a lightning strike.  from wiki  Molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere cannot be used directly by either plants or animals, and needs to be converted into nitrogen compounds, or "fixed," in order to be used by life. Precipitation often contains substantial quantities of ammonium and nitrate, both thought to be a result of nitrogen fixation by lightning and other atmospheric electric phenomena. However, because ammonium is preferentially retained by the forest canopy relative to atmospheric nitrate, most of the fixed nitrogen that reaches the soil surface under trees is in the form of nitrate. Soil nitrate is preferentially assimilated by tree roots relative to soil ammonium.    Really, people, if you don't know or aren't willing to look it up, don't answer.

Also, even if  other energy sources are used, they only produce so much usable energy and only so much can be used at once. For example, one wind turbine cannot light up all of New York City, however, it can be used to cut dependence from other energy sources.   Energy production has to keep up with energy consumption, and once that energy is used, it often becomes a form of energy that is difficult (or impossible) to use again. for example, electric energy might be converted to heat or light energy, and those energies can diffuse into the environment rather easily and it is difficult to access it again
Q2sZhNmJaa	There were a lot of experiments and discoveries by scientists and physicists that led up to the invention of the radio. Through the years, many different refinements were made. The different technologies included the vacuum tube, rectifier, crystal and transistor.    The discovery leading to the invention of the radio started with a spark generated from a wire and magnet. This led to the understanding that electromagnetic waves could be created by combining light and electromagnetic forces. This was the proof that electromagnetic signals could travel through air at the speed of light. The radio device invention has been accredited to Gugliemo Marconi, an Italian inventor. Marconi sent and received the first radio signal in 1895. It would soon be the crystal that would lead to the availability of wireless communication. By 1899, the first wireless signal was emitted from Italy to across the English Channel. Until then, homing pigeons were used for communication purposes.    In 1901, Marconi owned and operated a wireless communication business. The radio became a way for millions of Americans to convey information and ideas. In 1907, American inventor Lee DeForest invented the audio signal detector, which allowed amplification of radio frequency signals. Soon AM (amplitude modulation) was discovered. Edwin Armstrong, another American inventor, developed the super heterodyne circuit in 1918; and in 1933, discovered how FM (frequency modulation) broadcasts could be created.     The very first sounds over the air were not very clear. The radio had to be made easier to use, smaller and made of efficient materials. The military had a keen interest in the invention and on-going technology of the radio for their own purposes. They knew the importance of this device and supported its development    The phonograph consisted of a bulky horn one was to talk into and a stylus joined up with a disc. The gramophone joined up a disc that is recorded. It was here at this point where the radio became a sensational success. The juke box was invented in 1924, and thus vinyl records at different rpms made a huge hit with the buying public. HI FIs came into existence in the 1920s. Each different technology made the transmission over the airwaves of broadcasting sound better.

GuTUQpSpaa	On very rare occasions, we will experience two full moons in a single month, the second referred to as a "blue moon".  Since the lunar cycle is about a month long, we normally experience only 12 full moons a year, one per month.  However, the lunar cycle isn't exactly a month long -- along with the 12 full lunar cycles in a year, we have 11 leftover days from the beginning and/or end of the year, both of which often don't coincide with a new moon.  As a result of the accumulation of there 'extra' days, we see a blue moon every 2.5 to 3 years.|`|iTktGWWtaa	What is a "Blue Moon"?    For more than half a century, whenever two full Moons appeared in a single month (which happens on average every 2 1/2 to 3 years), the second has been christened a "Blue Moon." In our lexicon, we describe an unusual event as happening "Once in a Blue Moon." This expression was first noted back in 1821 and refers to occurrences that are uncommon, though not truly rare.     On past occasions, usually after vast forest fires or major volcanic eruptions, the Moon has reportedly taken on a bluish or lavender hue. Soot and ash particles, propelled high into the Earth's atmosphere, can sometimes make the Moon appear bluish.|`|pOU1vVW9aa	A blue moon occurs when there are two full moons in one month.  The moon takes 29.5 days to orbit Earth (relation to the sun) and most months are 30-31 days.  So if a full moon occurs at the very beginning of the month, another full moon can sneak in at the very end of the month.  That is a blue moon.  It has nothing to do with the color of the moon.|`|RALliiZTaa	it means a full moon twice in the same month. that happens on very rare occasions. it can have a bluish color if you are near a volcano that is active and the smoke is in the air but in general its not blue at all|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Good tasting beer. Just kidding....      What is a Blue Moon?  There are in fact two definitions for a blue moon. According to the more recent definition, a blue moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. For a blue moon to occur, the first of the full moons must appear at or near the beginning of the month so that the second will fall within the same month.    The Other Kind of Blue Moon  An older definition for the blue moon is recorded in early issues of the Maine Farmer's Almanac. According to this definition, the blue moon is the third full moon in a season that has four full moons. Why would one want to identify the third full moon in a season of four full moons? The answer is complex, and has to do with the Christian ecclesiastical calendar.     Some years have an extra full moonthirteen instead of twelve. Since the identity of the moons was important in the ecclesiastical calendar (the Paschal Moon, for example, used to be crucial for determining the date of Easter), a year with a thirteenth moon skewed the calendar, since there were names for only twelve moons. By identifying the extra, thirteenth moon as a blue moon, the ecclesiastical calendar was able to stay on track.     A Star Rating for the Modern Blue Moon   Although Sky & Telescope calls the modern blue moon definitition "trendy" and a "mistake," the fact that there is an older, preexisting (and more complicated) definition does not necessarily make it the more interesting or meaningful definition. Charting the "third full moon in four full moons" in a season isn't everyone's idea of an fascinating enterprise. The modern, "trendy" definition, however, points to an intriguing astronomical phenomenonevery so often two moons can manage to position themselves in the same month. Given that full moons occur once every 29.5 days, this is quite an accomplishment!    How Often Does a Blue Moon Occur?  Over the next twenty years there will be a total of 17 blue moons, with an almost equal number of both types of blue moons occurring. No blue moon of any kind will occur in the years 2011, 2014, and 2017.    The more recent phenomenon, where the blue moon is considered to be the second full moon in a calendar month. Two full moons in one month may occur in any month out of the year except for February, which is shorter than the lunar cycle.    Since this type of blue moon is reckoned according to the seasons, it can only occur in February, May, August, or November, about a month before the equinox or the solstice.    Twice in a Blue Moon  The rare phenomenon of two blue moons (using the more recent definitition) occurring in the same year happens approximately once every 19 years. 1999 was the last time a blue moon appeared twice, in January and March.    The months of the double blue moons are almost always January and March. That is because the short month that falls in between them, February, is a key ingredient in this once-every-nineteen-year phenomenon. For January and March to each have two full moons, it's necessary for February to have none at all. Since February is usually 28 days long, and the average span between full moons is 29.5 days, if a full moon occurs at the end of January, it's possible for the next full moon to skip February entirely and fall in the beginning of March.    (((Once in a Blue Moon)))  "Blue moon" appears to have been a colloquial expression long before it developed its calendrical senses. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first reference to a blue moon comes from a proverb recorded in 1528:    If they say the moon is blue, We must believe that it is true.Saying the moon was blue was equivalent to saying the moon was made of green (or cream) cheese; it indicated an obvious absurdity. In the 19th century, the phrase until a blue moon developed, meaning "never." The phrase, once in a blue moon today has come to mean "every now and then" or "rarely"whether it gained that meaning through association with the lunar event remains uncertain.

uWAfvTgMaa	Using Preservatives to Extend the Shelf Life of Your Products  Commercial products are typically loaded with preservatives to allow them to remain fresh during the long span between the time of manufacture and the time the customer finishes using it. Although the preservatives do extend the longevity of the products and help keep them free from bacteria, the preservatives themselves are often unhealthy. Many cause or promote skin problems and some are even reported to cause cancer. Individuals who are sensitive to these preservatives need to find preservative-free products.    Are there any natural preservatives? Not really. Natural substances that show antimicrobial activity are either not adequate for broad spectrum protection or they have undesirable qualities. Most natural substances are not active against the most threatening microbes, pseudomonads. Others, such as essential oils, require very high concentrations to be effective. Some have offensive odors or colors that would be unacceptable in skin care products. Many become inactivated by manufacturing procedures and other factors. So a natural preservative is not really an option.    One of the many advantages to handcrafting your own natural products is that you can eliminate or minimize the use of harmful preservatives. Instead, you can adapt more natural methods of preserving and/or using your products.        Preservative-Free Formulations    It's important to remember that your preservative-free, natural products will not stay fresh for as long as commercial products do. By making your products in small batches that you use up within a short period of time, your products will stay fresh and you eliminate the need to preserve your products with harsh chemical preservatives. Formulating anhydrous products is another way to eliminate the need for chemical antimicrobial preservatives. Bar soaps typically do not require an antimicrobial but stay fresher when an antioxidant is used. You do have natural antioxidants available to you for this purpose. Switch to the use of natural balms made of oil and butter instead of creams and lotions which require an antimicrobial preservative. Create dry bath products such as bath salts, milk baths, bath bombs, bath teas etc. to eliminate the need for antimicrobial preservatives. Salt scrubs, bath oils, bath melts and other oil based products can stay fresh as long as water is not introduced to the container during use. Again, you may wish to use a natural antioxidant to keep the oils fresh. Minimize contamination potential by choosing your packaging carefully. Dispensing bottles are better than open mouth jars.    Direct sunlight and UV rays, oxygen, heat, moisture and bacteria from your fingers can all be detrimental to your products. Below are several tips for protecting and preserving your preservative free formulations:    Be sure your hands, work surface, and utensils are clean/sterile when preparing your products. This will help ensure that you do not introduce bacteria or contaminate your batch. Commercial skin care production is undertaken in extremely clean and sterile environments for this same reason.   Store your products in dark containers or opaque packaging to keep them away from the harmful effects of sunlight. We offer a wide selection of packaging solutions for your products.   Ensure that your packaging is airtight. Natural products can oxidize and go rancid when exposed to air.   Heat can also be damaging to natural products. Store products in a cupboard or other cool place.   Because our fingers can be a host to bacteria, try to avoid dipping your fingers into your jars and bottles. Instead, use a clean spoon, toothpick, popsicle stick or other appropriate utensil to obtain the amount that you wish to use. Lotion pumps and PET bottles with turret or disc tops are wonderful for dispensing more fluid ingredients such as lotions and gels. Please see our Packaging section for our selection of lotion pumps and bottles.       When You Have to Have an Antimicrobial Preservative    If you are formulating something that contains water, milk, hydrosols or other aqueous liquids, you will have to preserve the product or use it within 3-4 days refrigerated. It simply is not optional. Water provides a medium for harmful bacteria, mold, yeast and fungi to grow over time. If used, a contaminated product could cause severe health problems, blindness and even death. Your product must be adequately preserved to prevent contamination and microbial growth.    So what are your options and how will your product differ from those found on store shelves?    First, even with a preservative, your product is still a healthier alternative to commercial products because the remaining ingredients within your product are natural or gentle.   Second, you won't use unnecessarily high levels of preservatives like most commercial manufacturers use.   Your options will be based on your formulation and what it contains. Essential|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Salt was used in olden days to preserve meats, as was smoking it, especially on long sea voyages.    Citric acid is also a natural preservative

You always risk the chance of blwing out your veins and developing scar tissue.  Now if you are in a hospitalk and they are giving you something IV then they are alot more equipped to do so, if you are constantly getting injections then you can still develop scar tissure and you can still have collapsed veins but the risk is much less with being in the hospital.

Mathematically if "A is what percent of B" is the question, then we know that:    A = (P/100) * B    where P is the answer we are alooking for    hence we can solve for P    P = (100*A)/B    testing in my example    P = (100 * 19) / 50  P = 38|`|S8TarSM8aa	I cannot answer all of them but here is how to do it. 50% = 50:100, 25% = 25:100, 10% = 10:100 and so on.     50% of 100 = 50:100 (50 percent) x 100 (of 100).    So, for your first question, 40 is what percent of 100, here is how you do it: 40 = y : 100 x 100, y being the answer to your problem. Second qestion, 88 = y : 100 x 80, again y being the answer.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    On every type of factoring problem ALWAYS look first for a GCF, a greatest common factor. There won't always be one, but if there is, you should divide it out first. A GCF will carry along through the problem and be the first thing in an answer with a GCF.    I' m going to explain factoring trinomials the way that I teach it, which may be different from what you've done. Try to follow the steps. This method will work on any trinomial.    3y2 - 13y - 10 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses with the first number and variable.   (3y.......)(3y..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 3 x 10 = 30 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 30.    30  ------  1, 30  2, 15  3, 10  5, 6    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (3y..-....)(3y...+.....) Your signs are different, so you want to subtract factors to get 13. Those factors are 2 and 15. ( Notice that 3 and 10 would have added to 13, so you HAD to know to subtract this time.) When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first. So your factors now are:  (3y..-..15)(3y.+.2.)    Now you have to reduce either or both parentheses by dividing each parentheses' terms by the largest possible divisor. In our problem, the first parentheses is divisible by 3 but the second parentheses does not reduce.    (3y..-..15)(3y.+.2.)  -------------  .......3 This reduces to your final factors of    (y - 5)(3y + 2)    NEXT PROBLEM !!    2x2 +15x + 7 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses   ............................. with the first number and variable.   (2x.......)(2x..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 2 x 7 = 14 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 14.     14  ------  1, 14  2, 7    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (2x..+....)(2x...+.....) Your signs are the same, so you want to add factors to get 15. Those factors are 1 and 14. When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first. So your factors now are:  (2x.+.14)(2x.+.1)    Now you have to reduce either or both parentheses by dividing each parentheses' terms by the largest possible divisor. In our problem, the first parentheses is divisible by 2 but the second parentheses does not reduce.    (2x.+.14)(2x.+.1)  -------------  .......2 This reduces to your final factors of    (x + 7)(2x + 1)      2x2 + 7x - 4 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses   ............................. with the first number and variable.   (2x.......)(2x..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x.........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x..-.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 2 x 4 = 8 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 8.     8  ------  1, 8  2, 4    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (2x..+....)(2x...-.....) Your signs are different, so you want to subract factors to get 7. Those factors are 1 and 8. When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first.

They have 6 electrons in their valence shells.    Reactive metals are found in the first two columns on the far left of the periodic table.

So if you split uranium's nucleus, you might get radium or another radioactive element, but you will not get uranium.

Earthquakes are caused by fracturing and movement of rock strata on a massive scale, and no type of rock can resist the enormous forces involved.    The safety of the city is measured by the earthquake resistance of its buildings.   The safest buildings are founded directly on the bedrock.  Buildings that are founded on soft or loose soil above the rock are much more susceptible to damage from the earth movement.  But with correct design, buildings can be founded on pretty much any soil and still resist damage from the earthquake.
uPVnqbE8aa	The question is obvious to anyone who knows anything about animals and wildlife in general.  Zoos are built for one purpose and one purpose only:  to make money.  Not for the sake of the animals housed there.  The animals themselves come a dismal third in priorities by the people running these Zoos.  In Zoos the animals do NOT do the environment any good at all.  The ONLY thing they do do is make money for the owners.  Animals belong, and always have belonged, in the wild.  There, they can help keep the environment healthy and our planet strong, and each do their part to make the world a better place.  When man messes with nature and the animals in the wild he screws up the balance and will eventually cause the ruination of the planet if he does not wise up and change his ways.|`|0bPJnvFFaa	In a perfect world there would be no zoos but it is sadly not perfect.

These animals are generally offspring of animals from other zoo's.  The reason they are kept there is they have never been in the wild and are not suited for survival in the wild.  Also, zoo's are not just places you go to look at the animals.  There is research being done to protect them from extinction.  For example at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans a reproductive specialist developed an embryo transfer method of bongos into ealand to help the population recover.  So I am very pro zoo because in addition to the research, they educate the public on the plight of endangered species and the loss of their habitat.|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	Because humans are destroying their habitat, many animals face extinction.  In some cases, it is thought that with time, some habitat will be restored.  Like in some cases, war has disrupted what would be normal commerce and people hunt endangered species for food.  So there is a good reason to keep those species in safe sites until their habitat can be restored.  Some species do quite well as they seem to be quite content in captivity and they have never known any other life.  Humans are often content in surroundings that are quite different than they lived in 20,000 years ago.  So natural is not necessarily better as many species live much longer in zoos or wild animal parks due to lack of predation.|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Most people dont know how zoo animals are kept. They are not in their natural environment first of all. Some are taken from the wild, and forced to live in cages for the rest of their lives. Most animals are not allowed to breed, and when the zoo wants babies they artificially inseminate them. The zoo builds the habitats with people in mind, not the animals. The enclosures are made so that people can easily view them, which means they have no where to hide. They constantly have people staring at them through glass, yelling, growling, and tapping the glass at them. How do you think this makes them feel?   Yes, some zoos do have great educational programs, but its at the expense of the animals they are trying to "save". They are telling children that we must save the Polar Bear, yet they show them that it is okay to take this majestic animal from the wild and put him in a tiny glass cage. Where is the sense in that?|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	You obviously must not know that the natural habitats of wild animals are being destroyed worldwide at an alarming rate.  Soon, zoos will be the only place left on the planet where wild animals exist.  Also, animals are not captured from the wild and put into zoos, this practice stopped decades ago..all zoo animals were either born there, or were transferred from another zoo.  Many zoos, besides being great educational tools for people to learn about wild animals, also participate in endangered species breeding programs.  If not for zoos, the California Condor would be extinct..zoos literally brought it back from the brink of extinction.  If you feel so strongly about wild animals being able to live in their natural habitat..I would like to ask you what exactly YOU do to help contribute to saving their  habitats in nature??   It seems there are always people ranting and raving about the evils of zoos yet make no effort to ensure these animals survival in the wild.  Most zoos have certain standards they must keep up, and most zoos today opt for more natural enclosures...few have cages like zoos of the past. Sure, in a perfect world I would love to see all animals living and surviving in the wild, but our world is far from perfect so I am all for zoos.

That is because they have seen a lot of science fiction films and can easily associate with human like counterparts.

In the design of experiments and data analysis, control variables are those variables that are not changed throughout the trials in an experiment because the experimenter is not interested in the effect of that variable being changed for that particular experiment. In other words, control variables are extraneous factors, possibly affecting the experiment, that are kept constant so as to minimize their effects on the outcome. An example of a control variable in an experiment might be keeping the pressure constant in an experiment designed to test the effects of temperature on bacterial growth.      [edit] Control theory  In control theory, control variables are variables that are input to the control system. Reaction rate is the dependent variable and everything else that can change the reaction rate must be controlled (kept constant) so that you only measure the effects of concentration. Variables that need to be controlled in this case include temperature, catalyst, surface area of solids, and pressures of gases. If not controlled, they complicate the experiment and hence, the result.|`|WmkG0on3aa	the controlled variables in an experiment is what you change in the project to make the outcome change, for example, say you want to see how fast a plant grows,  with light and watered or no light and watered, when you change the option of it being with light it changes the outcome, you are controlling that variable, therefore the controlled variable is what you change in the experiment.
IBgSBEKxaa	I'm sure there is another way to do it, but this way works fine:    What you are trying to find is f(1+h) as h tends to 0.  f(1+h)=(4h+6h^2+4h^3+h^4)/(3h+3h^2+h^3...  Then as h tends to 0, the higher power terms in h disappear first, so we are left with  f(1+h)->(4h)/(3h)=4/3.    Drawing the graph of this function on a graphical calculator verifies the answer.
GwQoeHK4aa	This can be tricky (and the example you gave in Additional Details shows an unique case).    Usually atoms follow the octet rule which means that they have eight electrons associated with them.  Common exceptions are hydrogen which has two, and sulfur and phosphorous which have 10 (and Cl as in the example given).  When I teach this topic I generally use tell people to use the following technique:  The example I'm going to use is CH2OH.  1) Write out all the atoms in the order listed.  You would write two 'H's next to one C, next to one O, next to one H.    2) For each valence electron put a dot around the atom.  C has 4 valence electrons, H has one, and O has one.  So you would have two H's each with one dot next to a C with four dots around it next to an O with six dots around it next to an H with one dot.    3) Connect pairs of dots together.  You want the octet rule to be followed (around each atom there should be 8 electrons: count one for every unpaired electron, four for a double bond, and six for a triple bond).  For hydrogens there can only be 2 electrons (one single bond).  Sometimes the octet rule cannot be followed.  For example for ClF5 you would have a Cl in the center with 7 dots around it and 5 F atoms which each have 7 dots around them.  If you connect one dot from the Cl with each of the F atoms, each of the F atoms follows the octet rule (has 6 unpaired electrons and one single bond) and the Cl has five single bonds and two unpaired electrons.  This is the fewest bonds you can have in ClF5 and still have all the atoms bound together.      Basically I would use the connect the dots rule for most molecules.  If you can connect all the atoms and surround each with 8 electrons (the octet rule) that is ideal.  In following the octet rule you are filling both the s and the p orbitals for the atom.  If you have put the appropriate number of dots around an atom and connected it with single bonds to all neighboring atoms with single bonds but have still not fulfilled the octet rule, connect another pair of dots (making a double bond). If you have still not fulfilled the octet rule connect another pair of dots (making a triple bond).  If when you were making single bonds, you needed more bonds in order to connect all the atoms you can have no more than 18 electrons around a center (s, p, and d electrons).  Hope that helps!|`|StZc4tjpaa	theres a thing called the octet rule which calls for most elements to have 8 valence electrons     each bond = 2 electrons and carbon always has 4 bonds so in order to make it have 8 electrons it has to create double or triple bonds.     you cant just create electrons, each compound will have a certain amount of valence electrons based on their positions in the periodic table you count the s and p levels. so to be within the limit of the electrons, some elements have to share electrons.    when you form a double or triple bond you have to erase 2 dots from the other element you're taking the electrons from so they share in order to make 8    gah did i make it too confusing|`|HPLuCRm5aa	Look at the number of bonding domains.    for example, Calcium has a charge of +2 and oxygen has a charge of -2. They bond, and calcium gives up 2 electrons to the same oxygen, creating a double bond, forming a binary compound (Calcium Oxide)    It all depends on the elements. The main thing is the number of electrons being transfered.|`|VUAN5A1Aaa	Tip:  Carbon can have a valence (charge) of +/- 4.  So the number of bonds around the carbon depends on the   of stuff bonded to it.  Each straight line that designates a bond equals 2 electrons.  The carbon has to have a total of 8 electrons around it  (this would equal 4 bonds).    Ex.   CH4  (methane)  is C in center with 4 single bonds around it (to the right, to the left, 1 above and 1 below)    Ex.    H-C(triple bond to)C-H    (acetylene)  Each carbon has 1 H atom bonded by single bond and then triple bond to another C atom.  Total of 4 bonds (=8 electrons) around each C atom.    Ex.    ClHC(double bond to)CH2  (ethylene)  1st C atom has 1 CL atom and  1H atom single bonded to it and a double bond --->  this equals 4 bonds, containing 8 electrons around it--good!    2nd C atom, has 2 H atoms single bonded to it and a double bond    (this equals 4 bonds containing 8 electrons around this 2nd C atom---good!)      (It would be good for you to look at the drawings in your book. Sorry, I couldn't draw the structures showing the position of the bonds in 3 dimension.  Hope this helps a bit!!)

Before that, we don't know, because the laws of physics break down.    But if you say x started y, then you can always ask what started x.    So you either have to accept a first event, with no cause (or it wouldn't be a first event). Or you have to accept that we can go back infinitely in time. Or you have to accept that time is not linear.    All of which are counter-intuitve, but you have to accept one or the other. If you just say "God", then you have to ask how God was created.

So, similarly: If we ask ourselves:  What is 6 divided by 0?  What we are really saying is, 0 times what gives me 6?  0 times what gives me 6, we can't really define this number.

zFsTSrOcaa	There are three main stages in the course of a tsunami, and different technology is used to study each.    First is the formation of a tsunami through large-scale disturbance of the sea floor from an earthquake or large landslide.  These events cannot be predicted with any accuracy, and the relevant technology consists of seismometers to detect potential tsunami-forming earthquakes.  When a quake occurs, initial computer-generated epicenter and magnitude estimates are available within minutes.  If the quake is strong enough and centered under the ocean, a tsunami alert may be issued.    Note that an earthquake that is felt on land may have an undersea epicenter and can produce a tsunami.  In the December earthquake and tsunami a couple of years ago, towns near the epicenter sustained considerable quake damage before the tsunami completed the destruction.    Second, the tsunami travels through the ocean.  Networks of underwater sensors in tsunami-prone regions detect the change in water pressure as the tsunami passes over them, and the size and speed of the wave can be determined.  The tsunami's speed depends on the depth of the ocean, so undersea maps can also be used to predict a tsunami's speed and estimate when it may arrive at a given location.  Satellites can also detect tsunamis and provide information on their size and speed.    Finally, the tsunami reaches shore.  The height of the tsunami at landfall is strongly dependent on the topography of the coastline and adjacent ocean floor, and generalized predictions can be made regarding what areas are at greatest risk.|`|AA12139405	Dear friend I am the one issued the warning 2 hours before Tsunami  struck our coast.The same way I have also issued denial on several other occasions. The seismograph station or even the earthquake alarm like the one I have designed and in use from the past 7 years will record or warn the earthquakes at the arrival time of P wave. Seismograph can measure the magnitude of earthquakes. My earthquake alarm by experience we can decide the approximate magnitude of earthquakes. If the magnitude is high of more than 7 in Richter scale you can suspect the Tsunami. If the known active fault lines are far away from your place you can wight for few minutes to know if there is any immediate damage reported from any part of the world in land. If you don't get any damage report you  have to alert the people for probable Tsunami attack.If any place  experienced damages in the land don't panic the people .When the energy is released in land there will not be any remaining force to create Tsunami.   All the earthquakes are not creating Tsunami  There are some criteria for Tsunami  The epicenter could be under sea or in coastal area.  The magnitude not less than 7 in Richter scale  One among the tectonic plate should move upward   Even the volcanic eruption and rock slip may also cause the Tsunami  The force should have been released in the sea

In Excel a typical formula might contain cells, constants, and even functions. Here is an example Excel formula that we have labeled for your understanding.=B3 * 5 / SUM(B4:B7)    cell(s): B3 and the range of cells from B4:B7  constant(s): 5  function(s): SUM()  =B3 * 5 / SUM(B4:B7)  excel formulas: creating your first formula  This first formula will be as simple as they come and will teach you the basic form of an Excel formula. Create a new spreadsheet and then follow these steps:    Select cell A1  Type the following basic arithmetic formula into cell A1: =1+1Press Enter and notice how cell A1 changes from your formula to the result!his may seem simple, but there are a some very important things you should get out of this example. When you start off a cell entry with the equal sign "=" you are telling Excel that you want it to evaluate the following formula.    In our case we had a simple "1+1" we wanted Excel to solve for us. You can do this for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and any other operation you can think of.    Remember, if you do not start your entry with the equal sign, then Excel will not evaluate the cell!  using cells to create dynamic formulas  The most powerful aspect of Excel is not the simple calculator abilities we describes in our first formula example, but rather the ability to take values from cells to be used in your formulas.    Let's set up a basic sales spreadsheet to help explain this topic.    In cells A1-Notice: that cell D2 and D3 are blank, but should contain the amount of money from selling 150 candy items and 3 vegetables. By referencing the Quantity and Price cells we will be able to do this! Let's begin with Candy.  Note:It is very important to follow these steps exactly without interruptions! Select cell D2, candy's "revenue", and type the equal sign "=" to begin your formula.  Left-click on cell B2, Candy's Quantity and notice your formula is now "=B2"  We want to multiply Quanity(B2) by Price(B3) so enter an asterisk (*).. look out for link i am giving, bcoz pics are not being copied here.. and rest if the text is there too

More reactive metals -- Copper, Lead, Tin, Zinc,  Iron -  Are found in simple and complex compounds.   They need to be extracted into solution and then can be deposited as the base metal by chemical or electrochemical means    The most reactive metals -- potassium,  sodium,  magnesium,  aluminum -- Are quite easy to obtain as ions and to get into solution.   However,  they are so reactive that one needs to use quite powerful electrochemical methods to yield the free metal and then they may need to be protected from air to keep them from further reacting.

Though what you could probably do, is use a resistor to limit how much current flows through the wire. The only problem of doing this, would be that you would have quite a bit of power drop across the wire. Though doing so would also help make sure the wire does not simply fry. Maybe instead of looking for some kind of "special wire" You could find a variable resistor (also known as a potentiometer) to help do the job.    Or you could simply take a ton of wire, say 22 gauge or lower, keep it on its spool, and hook it up to some power like that. Though I doubt that its resistance level would still be extremely low, and would burn out before you could gain any data from it.    If you are simply looking for small grade wire, you could buy from an electronics company, such as jameco.    Remember, the smaller the wire, the higher resistance.  The higher the gauge of the wire, the smaller it is in diameter.|`|AA11061397	Search for nichrome wire.

To find the value of a, we realize that if we substitute x = 0 into the expression above, we'll get a(-24).  But since the graph has to go through the point (0, -6), we know that the expression has to equal -6 when x = 0.  Therefore we have    a(-24) = -6, or a = 1/4    So the expression we want is (1/4) (x^2 - 2x - 24)  or  (1/4)x^2 - (1/2)x - 6|`|p43YceDoaa	y=ax^2+bx+c  sub   0=16a-4b+c  0=36a+6b+c  -6=c  a=1/4  b=-1/2  y=x^2/4-x/2-6|`|75e45e59dd10e580d1c1f1052e55d7edaa	the standard equation for a parabola is    y=ax^2+bx+c............(1)    the x intercepts are at y=0    we are therefore given the points {-4,0},{6,0} and {0,-6} for {x,y}    plug these values for x and y into (1) to give three simultaneous equations in order to solve for a,b and c    plug the values of a,b and c into (1) and you have your parabolic equation in standard form

9lVgL0H2aa	okay first you would let y=0 and solve for the x intercepts using the null factor law.    This gives u x=0 and x=1    Now take note of the highest power when the equation has been expanded. this would be x^4    This means that you are graphing a positive quartic.    There is now one last thing to take note of. Because, when this equation is fully factorised, x^3=1, this means that there is a point of inflection at this point.     then u can differentiate the equation to give you...  y'=4x^3 -1  let y'=0 and solve for x to give u the x coordinate for any turning points.  4x^3=1  x^3=1/4  x=(1/4)^(1/3)    Now use this to find the y coordinate of the turning point.    y=(1/4)^(1/3) . -1/4    Now this should be easy to piece together!    put a point at each intercept, and at the turning point. then follow the shape that gives you!     sorry for the calc thing i just realised it says pre-calc. Then u prob dont need the turning point and u should just remember the basic shape of a quartic and use this to assist u once uve found the intercepts and their properties.

Having said that, the WAY you come up with an answer is say.. look at the first equation    y = x + 3    Another way of thinking of that equal sign is that "y *is the same thing as* (x+3)". That means I can take the SECOND equation and everywhere I see 'y' I can replace it with "(x+3)"    so we take the second equation    3x = y + 5    we notice the y and 'substitute' (x+3) to get    3x = (x+3) + 5    and now we have one equation with one unknown (x) (it doesn't count as a second unknown just cause we see x twice.  It's the same value in both spots.    So we just solve for x    3x = (x + 3) +5    taking it one step at a time    3x = x + 3 + 5    3x = x + 8  (combine the 3 and 5)    3x - x = x - x + 8  (subtract x from both sides)    2x = 0 + 8    2x = 8     2x/2 = 8/2  (divide both sides by 2)    x = 4    so now we know what x is, how do we find y?  Well we take either of our original equations, say    y = x + 3    and substitute our known value of x = 4    y = 4 + 3    y = 7    ---    And hopefully that's the answer    x = 4, y = 7    Two equations, two unknowns (x and y), solved by substitution.

WPPIaLORaa	Since the cyclohexane is a liquid and the zinc is a solid, the simplest way would be to run the mixture through a filter paper.   The zinc chloride is not very soluble in the cyclohexane, so little will be lost due to the filtration.  This is the process that uses the least energy.    You could also distill off the cyclohexane by heating it to some temperature above its boiling point and below the melting point of the zinc oxide.  Again, the solubility is not much of an issue.    You could put the mixture in a high speed centrifuge.  The zinc chloride will settle as a precipitate at the bottom.

wJTsifugaa	Start by taking a look at what happens to the atomic number and weight.  In the C-14 to N-14 example, the atomic number goes from 6 to 7 and the atomic weight is unchanged.  Just the atomic weight not changing tells you it can't be alpha decay because an alpha particle weighs 4 AWUs!  So gaining a proton with no weight change tells you that a neutron had to convert to a proton and the only way to do that is to emit an electron from the neutron through beta decay, removing the negative charge and leaving a positive proton.    Now look at the lead (Pb) to mercury (Hg) conversion.  The atomic number of Pb is 82, Hg is 80.  The atomic weight is not given.  The easiest way to remove two protons is through alpha decay, with two protons and two neutrons being released.      Hope this helps!|`|68ac025966a90f17b64bd62c43e12561aa	C14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons nitrogen N14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons  If a nucleus emits an alpha particle its mass should lower of 4 and the atomic number of 2. Here the mass does not change (14) for both    So C14 emits an electron and a negative electron radioactivity beta -  you write as under    C14 (14,6) ---> N14 (14,7) + e(0,-1)
c9JIir2Laa	Remember the isotope notation set up (look at the source provided)? :)    The mass is on top (A) while the protons and electrons are on the bottom (Z). The symbol of the element (X).    Protons and electrons are always the same, if there's no charge. For your Cu example, it has no charge. So the protons and electrons amount are the same. Protons are determined by the "atomic number." Look at the periodic table. Cu is number 24.    Protons = 24, Electrons = 24.    To find neutrons, you take the mass and subtract the number of protons from it. Cu has a mass of 52.    So take 52 - 24 = 23 neutrons. Remember: A (mass) - X (protons) = neutrons!    ---    Ga 3+ ...    It has a 3+ charge. Again, protons never change (atomic number, X). Look at the table.   Ga has 31 protons. Since there's a charge this time, the electrons change.    Remember! Think opposite! Do not add 3 to find electrons. 3+ means it loses electrons (so subract from protons), while 3- means it gains electrons (for this, add to protons).    In your case: 31 - 3 = 28 electrons.    For neutrons, subract the protons from the mass of Ga.    Mass of Ga = 70.   So, 70 - 31 = 39 neutrons.    Good luck with the rest and hopefully I helped out some. :)|`|e1b7fa175ee86774c026fbd4b9b163a4aa	okay proton number can be read directly from the periodic table...as far as the electrons are concerned, it depends if the element is neutral or anion or cation...if atomic mass is in decimal, then number of neutrons(which is atomic mass - proton number) cannot be in decimal..this means that for this element, isotopes exist...so you can take two answers for that...  hope this helps=)  have a nice day
Sw61kY7Saa	An isotope is an element that has a varied number of neutrons    Carbon has 12 protons, thats a given, if it had 16 protons it wouldn't be carbon...it would be oxygen    however the number of neutrons they have can vary, carbon-12 has you guessed it...12 neutrons and carbon-14 has 14. These are known as isotopes of carbon.|`|9GXftfAOaa	Isotopes are atoms of an element having the same number but different mass numbers. and also, elements have two or more isotopes. not all isotopes are stable. some are continously decomposing to form other elements.. that's all!!!|`|Yhn1QI17aa	isotopes are different types of atoms of the same chemical element, each having a different atomic mass (mass number). Isotopes of an element have nuclei with the same number of protons (the same atomic number) but different numbers of neutrons. for carbon-12 and carbon-14, the hyphenated number represent the mass number. Mass number is the sum of neutrons and protons.  Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.  Carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.    When the element contains N isotopes, the equation below is applied for the atomic weight M:      M = M1xn1 + M2Xn2....MNxnN  where M1, M2, ..., MN are the atomic masses of each individual isotope, and 1,...,N are the relative abundances of these isotopes.
r1hURLPAaa	The Band of stability is the range of the Number of Neutrons vs Number of Protons for Stable Nuclei graph that plots all stable nuclei. The band of stability can be used when looking at isotopes in order to determine how an element will undergo radioactive decay. An example of this table can be seen here:    In order to determine where an element lands on the graph, one must look at the periodic table of elements. First, we must determine how many neutrons are contained in the isotope in question. To do that, subtract the number of the number of protons (dictated by the isotope's periodic number) from the atomic mass of the closest common isotope. Do that again for the isotope you are dealing with. Compare the number of neutrons in each to find out where it lays on the band. Then, you may determine the type of radiation emitted.      If an atom has more than 82 protons in the nucleus, there is no arrangement of neutrons that can  produce more attractive forces than repulsive forces. Therefore, all isotopes of elements beyond lead  are radioactive. Their only route to stability is to first reduce the overall size of the nucleus by losing  large particles called alpha particles.

mmWeBRRtaa	To understand how a thermos works, it helps to understand why an ordinary container doesn't work very well for thermal insulation.    Suppose you take an ordinary container (such as a drinking glass, or a coffee mug), and fill it with hot soup.  If you put your hand on the outside of the container, it will feel very hot.    When objects of different temperature are near each other, they tend to reach an equilibribum -- the cooler object gets warmer, and the warmer object gets cooler.  In the case of a container filled with hot soup, the container conducts heat from the soup to the outside.  The soup gets cooler, and the room gets a tiny bit warmer.    A thermos keeps hot liquids hot (or cold liquids cold) by providing good insulation.  A high-quality thermos consists of a double-walled glass container, with a vacuum between the glass layers.  This container is protected from breakage by placing it inside a larger metal or plastic container.  Heat conduction does not occur through a vacuum, so there is little heat transfer between the inside and outside.  If you fill the thermos with hot soup, and then place your hand on the outside of the thermos, you will not feel the heat (or will only barely feel it) from the inside, because there is very little heat transfer.    A thermos isn't a perfect insulator, but it's very good.  Hot soup in a coffee mug might cool off in 15 minutes; but inside a thermos, it can stay hot for many hours.    ---    The above description is for a classic thermos with a glass inner bottle, but there are other designs.  Many thermoses today use a double-walled container made of metal instead of glass, still with a vacuum between the walls.  (The advantage of metal is that it's unbreakable.  The disadvantage is that metal conducts heat better than glass.)    Then there are insulated cups and containers that simply have a thick layer of foam.  These are not as good as the vacuum designs, but they provide some degree of thermal insulation.    All three of these designs are pictured here:  http://www.thermos.com/technologies.aspx    This page shows the three types of thermos designs:  - double-walled metal with vacuum between the walls  - double-walled glass with vacuum between the walls  - foam insulation    ---    For another description of thermos bottles, see here:  http://home.howstuffworks.com/thermos.ht...  It mentions that in a thermos with a double-walled glass bottle, the glass is coated with a thin metallic layer (like a mirror) to reduce radiative heat loss.  (There are actually three different mechanisms of heat transfer -- conduction, convection, and radiation.  Convective heat transfer is not an issue for thermos bottles, but the goal is to minimize heat loss from conduction and radiation.)    ---    Let me get slightly more technical here and explain these three methods of heat transfer.  Suppose you have hot liquid in a coffee mug, which is sitting on a table.    Conduction is a straightforward transfer of heat from one area to another.  For instance, the liquid makes the mug hot -- that is, heat is transferred from the liquid to the mug.  The heat in the mug is transferred to the table, and so on.    In the case of fluids (liquid and gas), there's a second mechanism called convection.  Again consider hot liquid in a mug.  At the top you have a boundary between the liquid and air in the atmosphere.  As air molecules bounce around, heat from the liquid warms up the air immediately above it.  (You can feel this by holding your hand just above the liquid.)  When air is heated, it becomes less dense and rises, and other air takes its place, so there is a continual loss of heat through the atmosphere.  (There is a similar effect for the air that contacts the side of the mug.)  Convection refers to heat transfer through the motion of fluids (such as the motion of the air above the mug).    Radiation is less obvious.  If you turn the heat to "high" on an electric range, you see that the heating element glows red.  Actually, everything in a room is glowing, and the hotter the object, the brighter it glows.  For objects near room temperature, however, this glow takes place in the infrared, and your eyes can't see infrared radiation.  If you have a coffee mug of hot liquid, the mug becomes hot (through conduction).  It then radiates infrared radiation out to the room, and also absorbs infrared emitted by other objects.  But since the mug is hotter than other things, it emits more radiation than it absorbs, so it loses energy and cools off.    So a simple coffee mug loses energy through all three of these mechanisms.  A thermos bottle insulates its contents so as to minimize all types of heat loss.

9GXftfAOaa	The first law is the law of inertia, it states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object of motion will continue to move along a straight line with a constant speed unless acted upon by an external and unbalanced form. The second law is the law of acceleration, this law means that for a given force, the greater the mass of the object, the lesser the acceleration produced; and the greater the force applied the greater acceleration is produced. The third is the law of interaction, all forces occurs in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

ftwGaZ4Uaa	Look at the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal... there is a lot about what happened (The journal itself), how it happened, and when it happened.      The why is harder: In 1961, when the USSR launched the first men into space, the question was, how can the USA beat the USSR in the space race. The only viable option was going to the moon - in all less daring challenges, the Russians had an advantage (As seen from the USA). This goal was presented by president John F Kennedy:    "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him back safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."    This happened already in May 1961, 8 years before the landing. But this was not the start of the USA developing lunar spacecraft - early studies and the first rocket ideas are from 1953. But from 1961 on, this research became priority and funded with lot's of money. At the height of the Apollo program, NASA received 5% of the federal budget. Today, it gets merely 0.58%.|`|AA11564934	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_prog...|`|EPki0rwgaa	what happen?First man on moon by NASA  how did it happen ?

The United States sent a spacecraft carrying three people into lunar orbit, and part of the spacecraft was detached and brought two of those people (Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin) down onto the Moon's surface.    >how did it happen ?    If I recall correctly, the Apollo spacecraft used for the lunar landing missions were launched in at least two or three separate pieces (each piece launched on its own separate rocket) and then assembled in Earth orbit before using their own engines to go into orbit around the Moon. Once they were orbiting the Moon, one part of the spacecraft (the lunar lander) would carry two of the people down onto the Moon's surface, where they would get out and make various observations, and then later the top part of it would carry the people back up to the orbiting part of the spacecraft, whereupon the whole spacecraft and all three crew would return to Earth orbit. The first Moon landing, Apollo 11 (there were six landings in total, if I recall correctly), used this method.    >why did it happen?    Mostly because the United States was at that time engaged in a 'space race' with their cold war opponent, Russia, and it was intended to be a major PR point to land a person on the Moon before the russians did.    >when did it happen?     July 20, 1969.

7a7228defb41706136202a68675d2385aa	Analytical chemists typically use a diverse range of high tech methods to investigate the chemical nature of substances. The aim of such work is to identify and understand the substance and how it behaves under different conditions.    In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, analytical chemists are involved throughout the drug development process; they study the physical or chemical properties of drug substances and formulations, with a view to determining the quality and stability of drug products.    Analytical chemists may be involved in work like:         chemical or forensic analysis       process development       product validation       quality control       toxicology       drug formulation and development.     Typical work activities include:    Analysing samples from various sources to provide information on compounds or quantities of compounds present, using analytical techniques and instrumentation, such as gas and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion chromatography, electrochromatography and spectroscopy (infrared and ultraviolet, amongst others). Interpreting data and adhering to strict guidelines on documentation when recording data, reporting scientific results, using a range of analytical techniques, instrumentation and software, developing new techniques for the analysis of drug products and chemicals, working collaboratively in cross-functional teams, liaising with customers, staff and suppliers, using the internet and email, being aware of, and keeping up to date with, health and safety issues in all aspects of the work undertaken.    I think that should help.    P.S. Why are you giving a speech on analytical chemistry when you know nothing about it?

Sw61kY7Saa	At the moment we have discovered almost 400 exo-planets (planets outside our solar system).    Of these none contain life, and you might assume its damning evidence that the chances are very slim, however its quite the opposite    As of the moment the only planets we can 'see' (most we don't see visually, and only some even in IR) most are 'seen' by evidence that they are there, like when they pass across their star, we get evidence of the planet by a fluctuation in light intensity)    some are seen by gravitational lensing around a star through (gravity acting as a magnifying glass around large bodies of mass)      Anyway these limiting factors mean we can only see very large or very hot planets, nicknamed 'hot jupiters'    Very large planets are often gas giants and not rocky with uninhabitable atmospheres, and the hot ones.....well they are too hot    so as of yet all discoverable planets have an extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemly (cant really stress enough how small) chance of life    There is a thin strip around a star names 'the lifebelt' this is the area a planet needs to be in to sustain the right temperature etc. to house life.    Earth is in this band arund the sun and mars just scrapes in aswell, 2 in one solar system? u gta love those odds =)    anyway, the chance gets smaller still as the planet also has to have the correct composition/atmosphere    However even though the chance of a single star having a planet with life on is extremely slim, with the trillions of stars (the number is mindblowing how many there are) in our universe playing the odds of probability there chances are tehre are thousands if not tens of thousands, maybe even millions? of planets out there with life    The only problems are: the chance of 2 being close enough together on any biological timescale to communicate is very very slim, for example the closest star to use takes 5years for light to get here (bar the sun ofcorse) so the chance are theres life, the chance of us contacting any if very slim.    However we beam radiowaves out into space hoping to contact life, if they did the same milllions of years ago they might be dead now but we could recieve a signal from previous life forms miles away.    So a brief answer to your question, chances are theres lots of life out there, finding it is the real problem|`|TrYourYlaa	Yes, i believe intelligent life is possibly out there. Could be more civilized but not something that we see in fiction. Our galaxy is so vast. Even today scientists are not confirmed about its size. In Early 2008, researchers said Milky Way has 50% more mass and is traveling 120000km per hour faster than previously thought. So we cannot rule out the presence of other life when we cannot even get idea of its size.    SETI (Search for extraterrestrial intelligence) is organization searching the skies 24/7, all year for the transmitted or leaked signals by any alien civilization in any other solar system with the help of radio telescopes. And they even transmit signals in hope to contact any alien civilization.     Dr. Frank Drake, proposed rough estimate of number of extra terrestrial life in our galaxy with a formula/equation called 'The Drake Equation'. He guess the number to be 10,000. (detectable alien civilizations in our galaxy alone).|`|YHmr7nvsaa	It is a mathematical certainty that life exists out there.|`|AA11564934	THis has been asked and answered multiple times a day.|`|ZvV3cPPFaa	I think the idea is ridiculous.

I took a science course that dealt with life outside the Earth and I am now more convince that there is a very high possibility that they are out there somewhere. This is the textbook I read and if you really would like to learn more about this I highly recommend you read it:  http://www.textbookw.com/default.asp?pid...  You could look at other sites for better prices.  The universe is so massive that if a planet like Earth was one in a million chance, there would be 10,000 other planets like it in the universe maybe even more.Life here on Earth is everywhere even in places with very extreme temperatures and areas of very high radiation. What I mean is that life as we know it here on Earth can be completely different in another place in the universe. Maybe life thrives in extreme heat or maybe they drink ammonia instead of water.Even if they say life is not possible in a another distant galaxy there still can be life because we are using our Earth based idea of where life can be but this limits us to the possibilities of other type of life we do not know of.What isn't possible to survive for us can be entirely survivable for another life form.You are also not crazy about parallel universes. Look at these you tube videos from the discovery channel about scientists who are working on making a time machine(I am serious):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLQAx-sw0...  Look for all the parts on this video and they will talk about parallel universes.
UFteXlqwaa	It depends on what you call "smart." But from the two above answers, it seems to me that machines and people are simply ... complementary. Here is an example:    We have a brain and memory. Evolution developed it not really to remember the past but to prepare the future.    You were nearly killed by a lion. Survival wants you to remember that next time, you must run and fast! It doesn't care if you remember the lion was old of young, you must run!    Computers, on the other hand, can store e.g. the visual information accurately. It will tell you that the lion was actually an old one because you can now study carefully its photo. But the computer won't tell you that you must run fast next time you meet it.    We are complementary and man will always make machines that help, not compete.|`|Sw61kY7Saa	The human brain is a remarkable thing and any computer atm doesn't come even 1/1000 as smart as us    a computer can only carry out operations, it cant think for itself and adapt much beyond what it is programmed to do    i dont think it will ever happen, stop watching irobot so much =p    ------  to karth point, computers lacking emotion is probably a good thing? but definately agree with the others|`|CfdxiYbvaa	There's six things that humans have and robots lack:  1.

It is possible that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe, but it's difficult to quantify that possibility based on our current level of understanding.

VS0PuI5paa	It's not constant, it's relative.  It is progressive in the sense that it always goes forward, however.  It's actually a misconception to think that time has a forward and a backward.  It has a magnitude, that is a rate at which it moves, but not a direction.  It's rate depends on the observer's reference frame in space-time, which is to say his (or her) velocity relative to another object.  If I'm going nearly the speed of light relative to another object, for example, it will appear to almost stop in time, and vise versa.  Einstein described it as a function of the Pythagorean theorem: one axis is speed and the other time.  The hypotenuse is the speed of light, which remains constant.  If speed increases near to the speed of light, time decreases to zero but the speed of light stays the same.   Similarly, as speed approaches zero, time increases to its full value.  Again, the speed of light always stays the same value.|`|AA11564934	the flow of time varies depending on gravity and/or acceleration.

Being embedded within time as we are, our experience of it is limited in a way. If time suddenly began to flow backward as seen by a hypothetical being outside of time, the events within our brains that sum to our consciousness would also be happening in reverse, and it would seem exactly the same to us. I don't know if I've made myself clear on what I mean by this, but it's a difficult topic to discuss, isn't it? Our language is not geared to discussing time except as a uniform flow in the forward direction. Perhaps a theoretical physicist would be able to explain better, but I'm just some guy.

UFteXlqwaa	In addition to the NOAA site above, you must also remember that the name "hurricane" comes from the Atlantic tropical storms. In addition to that, hurricane is also the name of a wind of force 12 on the Beaufort scale.    In Europe, for example, we would call a hurricane, a storm with winds reaching hurricane force, but never a hurricane.     Then, since hurricanes are born outside Africa, you may as well wonder why hurricanes never reach say, the coast of Senegal. That is because of the Coriolis effect that spin both air masses and sea current clockwise in the northern hemisphere. In fact, after reaching the Caribbean, hurricanes sometimes follow the Gulf Stream and end as "normal" low pressures over northern Europe; following both prevailing winds and currents.    The same couldn't happen on the US Pacific coast. But I am sure it gets its share of polar frontal low pressures and associated storms, especially up north, right?|`|UTlAc13Daa	The reason is Pacific Ocean water temperature along the United States coastline is too cold.  I believe water temperature for hurricane needs to be in the 80 degree range that is why the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are  hot beds.|`|A7B5eyG2aa	that is an interesting question:    this should provide you all you need to know on the matter:    http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G8.ht...

If you meant NaOH in H20, you'd just have sodium and hydroxide ions (compete ioization)    NaOH (aq) --> Na+1(aq)   +  (OH)-1 (aq)|`|CLGTM3Vjaa	H30(+) + NaOH --> 2H2O + Na(+)(aq.)    It is possible. This is what happens when you add NaOH to water. There is always some H3O present in water, adding NaOH reduces the ratio of H30(+) to OH(-) thus making the solution more basic.

Length of arc for each strip: 5*pi / 4 = 1.25*pi    If we imagine the garden as a quarter circle in the first quarter, we can draw a line from the (0, 0) point to the diagonally opposite corner of each strip, find its angle and evaluate the cos value to find the width.  [try drawing it]    1-st strip:  Length of the arc is 1.25*pi     To find the angle, we can solve the proportion:  X/360=(1.25*pi)/(20*pi) .....[20*pi being the perimeter of the circle]  X=22.5 degrees    Width of the strip is cos(90-22.5) * radius = 3.827 ft [no errors yet]    To find the width of the second strip, we can find its angle and the cos value, and subtract the width of the first strip.

wi0CSqNSaa	Engineering is hands down THE MOST DIFFICULT UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR. If you think your major is harder you are mistaken. Most engineers need to take more units then you. IN all hardcore science and math classes.    Physics and Math give engineering a run for their money, but both of these classes give a wide range of GE's and are about as many units as a normal major. Example, a normal major at my school is 180 units(quarter sys). average class schedules are 12-16 units. An Engineer takes 208 units. 2 quarters more units then a non engineering student.    Unless you want to be at the bottom of your class. You seriously have to put the time and effort in. It isnt one of those major where you can study right before the midterm and get an A. It also isnt one of those majors where you can SHmooze with the TA's and have them boost your grade. It is very competitive! It is definately possible, but you have to be a dedicated student.    here is a breakdown of what you need to take    2 years of STRAIGHT CALCULUS  1 year of physics  1 year of chem  1 year of mechanics+dynamics(its basically physics over again, but harder)  a few computer classes  a few classes in material science(its like chem for engineers mixed with a bunch of other topics)  a few classes that mix material science and mechanics  thermo dynamics(physics+chem hybrid)    fluid dynamics 1 years this serious is pretty tough( its a mix of thermo, physics and math)    A few more math classes.    Also every single class is heavy in calculus.   1 year of     You will take a few design classes. Build some robots and stuff.    Engineering is one of those cool majors, where you can get a job that directly applies to your major. So you can start making money right away.     I broke it down for mechanical engineering the most balanced major. Aerospace is similar to mechanical    You will need to take specifics if you want to be a civil/structural(more structural engineering and material science)The statics and material science classes will be important for this    Nuclear this one is kinda dying out I dont know what you need to take.    Chemical More chem Duh... This one is hard.Chem really blows.    environmental engineering is a joke. Dont be one of those.    bioengineering This is a hot field, I wish I had done this. Its easy and in hot demand right now. Unfortunately, You might need to go into the doctorate area to get the cool jobs in this field.    computer, software, computer type engineers. Dont be a computer engineer. You will be outsourced. Indians will do these jobs better then you anyway. Unless you can speak english and hindustani pass on this career choice.|`|WTf0caplaa	Is this a B.S. in mechanical engineering with major in manufacturing?    For this, I know that it can be quite grueling at times. But, if you are good at spatial geometry are learn quickly then you'll have no problem maintaining good grades with this degree.    Typically, 1 credit hour = 2 hours of studying/work. So if you're part-time taking 10 credits, expect at least 20 hours of work/week. For example, a 3-credit course I'm taking right now, I took 4 hours to do the homework and another hour studying the material for a quiz. So that week, I put in 5 hours for a 3-credit course.|`|h48C2Rafaa	First thing I would want u to understand is that its only after you complete the course u will get a job which is as playful as u mentioned. I said that cz during the course it will be like u r put up in Hell, if u r not a bookworm. I can say this as I myself am on the verge of completing my B.Tech., and I know from my friends in other universities, that the other universities too, have the same story. If u want to get a job like the one u mentioned, u will have to put in a lot of effort and complete the course with about 70% aggregate marks(quite difficult but not impossible). End of the day, It is just as they quote, "The Root of Education is Bitter, But The Fruit is Sweet". Wish U luck, all the best!!|`|bKYAj1v8aa	I, currently, am on my 4th semester as a Mechanical Engineering major and i have studied my butt off so far. This is what i do. If i end up with a big gap in my schedule, i take advantage of it and study in that time frame. Or what other people do is work during that time frame. Try to get a job on campus since they will be the most flexible with your schedule. And blowing off some steam is always an essential part of your college life. I study Monday Thru Thursday and a little bit on Friday since i go out and blow off steam on Friday nights.    Study everyday if it is possible in order to avoid craming the day before the test. You will not always get good professors or understandible ones in the field of engineering. Therefore you will sometimes end up teaching yourself a whole course. For example, right now i have an indian professor for my differential equations class and he goes way too fast and this causes me to read the book and do examples by myself. I also taught myself calculus II. Take good notes and rewrite them in simpler terns on another notebook. It will help you and save you time in the long run. Always know where to find tutoring. It will also save you time and on top of that you will be assured of doing the concepts right. There are some organizations out there that even have workshops for certain classes. Do not be afraid to ask them if you could join their workshop even though you are not part of the organization. If there are isolutions manuals for the classes that you are taking, i highly recommend you to get them. It is better to know how to do it right and keep on doing it  rather than not being 100% sure. The only good student solutions manuals that i have used were the ones for Calulus I-III. The rest kind of suck and that is why you should get your hands on a pdf version of the instructor manuals (they cam be found in the web). I luckily do not have to work since i qualified for financial aid and on top of that, i have received extra grants that require you to be of a certain major and have a certain GPA. But you could apply for scholarships. A lot of people, including me think that it is very hard to get a scholarship and that is why they do not apply. This concern causes the scholarships to have very few applicants SO APPLY!.    Other than this, if it is something that you have a passioon for then go for it. Do not be scared and remember that there is always help somewhere.|`|KVuKal3Saa	Engineering course is actually quite tough and involve many hours of study, theory and practical.

It withstand being frozen for weeks.    Other frogs incubate their young in their stomaches and give birth through their mouth; The most toxic Poison is from the poison dart frog.

Such as get your required sciences and go a little further. Like, if 3 years of math is suggested, take all four, and take 3 years of a language instead of just two. This is because the only people looking at your High School grades are going to be colleges you want to attend. And since you're looking at the medical field you really do need to excel, not just good grades but great ones. Do the best in all your classes, and take some that may relate to medical sciences, such as an anatomy class, but for the most parts, you won't learn anything majorly important in the medical field from high school.

AA10202388	It is a mix of reasons!    From Physics it is scattering of light.    Light of sun is white, which means it is mix of seven basic colors.    When white light of sun passes through the atmosphere, the blue light is scattered in the atmosphere and other frequencies of light are not scattered. So the color of sky is blue.    The reason of scattering of blue light is in explanation from chemistry.    78% of air is Nitrogen which acts in thick layer of about 100 Kilometers as blue (liquid Nitrogen is blue) so the colour of sky appears as blue.    White light of sun consists of seven basic colors. Nitrogen absorbs all the colors except the blue and so the color of sky appears to be blue. At night when there is no light sky appears to be dark. Same happens when one gets out of the atmosphere.    On earth the color seems to have been always blue as the composition of air does not seem to have been changing in an effective proportion.    On other planets however, change of atmospheric gases results in different colors of sky.|`|HFVu27VRaa	bcoz blue color have shorter wavelength|`|PClyMS0xaa	Because when light hits water, it causes refraction.  The water acts as a sort of prism.  As you probably know, light is made up of the colors in the visible light spectrum (ROYGBIV) they are seperated and as the light bends, the most bent color is blue.  This causes the ocean to appear blue.  (Also notice that when you scoop some if it up in a cup, it is clear and colorless)  I hope my explanation helps.|`|g43ta86Zaa	it is so because the sunlight is a white light which disperses into spectrum.when the sunlight enters earth's atmosphere it gets dispersed as the atmosphere acts as colloidal solution to it.blue colour is of short wave length therefor it is scattered the most so the sky appears blue to us.|`|JwPu0XbIaa	This has been asked and answered thousands of times.

The technically correct answer is that the blue light is scattered more by the air molecules in the atmosphere (referred to as Rayleigh scattering).     Without being too technical, when sunlight hits the molecules in the atmosphere, some of the light gets scattered by the air molecules, some gets absorbed, and some passes straight through.  The red and yellow wavelengths of the spectrum tend to pass straight through, or get absorbed by the molecules (which warms the air and gives rise to the world's climate).   It is the scattering effect that gives rise to the blue colour.  The shorter the wavelength of light, the more it is scattered, and the blue wavelength is shorter than the red and yellow; so it is scattered more. It causes the air molecules to vibrate and 're-emit' the light..     Because the molecules vibrate in all directions, the light is emitted in all directions (this is the 'scattering'). The re-emitted radiation may then have the same reaction with other molecules, and it gets 'bounced around' from molecule to molecule. When it reaches us on the ground, it seems that the blue light is coming from everywhere; hence the sky seems blue. And of course; we are looking upwards through several kilometres of air; so there are plenty of molecules to scatter the blue light.
AA10202388	No.    The concept of color of sky is with atmosphere around the planet.    It is a mix of reasons.    From Physics it is scattering of light.    Light of sun is white, which means it is mix of seven basic colors.    When white light of sun passes through the atmosphere, the blue light is scattered in the atmosphere and other frequencies of light are not scattered. So the color of sky is blue.    The reason of scattering of blue light is in explanation from chemistry.    78% of air is Nitrogen which acts in thick layer of about 100 Kilometers as blue (liquid Nitrogen is blue) so the colour of sky appears as blue.    White light of sun consists of seven basic colors. Nitrogen absorbs all the colors except the blue and so the color of sky appears to be blue. At night when there is no light sky appears to be dark. Same happens when one gets out of the atmosphere.    On earth the color seems to have been always blue as the composition of air does not seem to have been changing in an effective proportion.    On other planets however, change of atmospheric gases results in different colors of sky.|`|VS0PuI5paa	The nitrogen in the atmosphere causes the sky to be blue, because it is not completely transparent to the bluer end of the light spectrum, but scatters it slightly.  Only Titan is known to have a nitrogen atmosphere besides earth.  It also has a lot of methane clouds however, giving it a yellow color if I remember the pictures from the Huygens probe correctly.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	No.  The colour of a planet's sky varies depending on the various gases in its atmosphere, assuming it has one.|`|AA11642486	no. the sky looks from earth, due to presence of atmosphere.|`|WTf0caplaa	No, the sky is blue due to the composition of the molecules in earth's atmosphere. This particular composition reflects/absorbs certain wavelengths of the visible light spectrum which make our sky appear blue.    However, on other planets, the composition could be radically different thus causing different wavelengths to be reflected/absorbed which would cause their sky to appear to be a different color.|`|pOU1vVW9aa	The answer is no.  Yes, the sky is blue on Earth but on other planets, different gasses create different sky colors     Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so the sky is black even during the day.  Venus has a dull orange sky, due to extremely thick clouds.  Mars has a pinkish to yellowish sky due to red dust floating high in the atmosphere.  Jupiter does have a blue sky.  I don't know about Saturn (may have a bluish sky as well), but I assume Uranus and Neptune has a dark blue sky.  On Pluto, it is black due to extreme distance from the sun.  Saturn moon, Titan, has a dark brown sky due to hazy atmosphere.  All the other moons and asteroids have black skies.

Impacts of rocks that big are very rare, happening at most once every few million years. Furthermore, when discoveries of this sort are made, scientists need a few days or weeks in order to get accurate trajectory data on the object. As a result, the probability of impact assigned immediately after such an object is discovered is often far, far higher than the probability of impact after corrections have been made to account for the new observations and more precise knowledge of the object's orbit. Of course, the media loves to sensationalize things, and so they naturally report on the discovery BEFORE the corrections are made, in order to scare us all. In this particular case, further observations have reduced the apparent probability of 2002 NT7 hitting the Earth in 2019 to virtually zero, and it has been removed from the list of objects considered to pose threats to the Earth within the foreseeable future.

The object under discussion in the article, 2002 NT7, is now known as (89959) 2002 NT7 and has a very well-determined orbit.  The object was removed as a potential risk on 1 August 2002, barely a week after the article you quote was published.    http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/removed.htm...    I couldn't find a list of close approaches for the object in the usual places so I eventually used JPL's HORIZONS system.  I had to push the encounter distance out to 0.5 AU (75 million km) to get any to show up.  The object never gets closer than 55 million km from Earth over the next 2 centuries (well until Jan 1, 2200.)  That's about as close as Mars was in August 2003.    The original impact possibility was 1 Feb 2019.  The closest the object gets around that date is a touch over 0.4 AU (60 million km) on January 13 of that year.    This is in spite of the fact that its orbit has a Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) with that of the Earth of 0.001 AU, meaning that it could come within half the distance to the Moon.  The orbits come that close, it's just that the two objects don't over the next 2 centuries.    This is one of those classic cases of an object looking dangerous on initial data, only to be located on older images and thus removed as a risk with the ink on the screaming headlines barely dry.    Admittedly objects don't go to a positive rating on the Palermo Scale that often.    http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/doc/palermo...    But this instance was just one of many that underscores the point that impact risks are not predictions but rather indicators of deficits in our knowledge (which often get filled in with time.)|`|AgPj9WH0aa	hmmm.. interesting.

That means that one side equals the other, and if that's true then if I add 10 to one side, I've got to add 10 to the other side to keep it equal. We're trying to get "a" all by itself, so if I subtract 1/b from both sides I get: 1/a = - 1/b + c. I can rewrite this as 1/a = c- 1/b. Now, how are we going to get "a" out of  1/a ? well, if I multiply "a" squared times  1/a (a2 x 1/a) the "a" in the denominator cancels one of the "a's" in a2 and I get "a" all by itself on the left side of the equation. But remember, I've got to do the same thing to the right side, so I get  a = a2( c - 1/b). That's the est you can do without values for b and c.

The second train is travelling 10 miles per hour west.  So, at the first hour they will be apart 10 + 9 = 19 miles.   So, for every one hour, the distance between them will be increased by 19 miles.  So, divide 167.2/19  = 8.8.  It is around 8 hours and 48 minutes.

Say you draw the starting point, X. Then draw a little line to the left marked 10, and one to the right of X marked 9. keep adding 19 until you get 167.2 (if it helps, you can add 10 and 9 separately, to each respective side, and keep track of how many times you added each)    Now look at how many times you had to add ten, and how many times you had to add nine. Add those, and that is how many hours it took for the trains to be 167.2 miles apart.   (I think the answer should be somewhere around 19)|`|FdQtgdBAaa	first u figure that ur going 19 miles per hour because the trains r going in seperate directions  then u r already given the data that u know the total miles(167.2) apart and u have to find the time so all u do is ....     19miles/1 hr  =    167.2 miles/?hrs    u find the answer by cross multiplying .  the ANSWER should come out to be 8.8 hrs    and if u want to check  multiply 8.8 to 10 and add it with 9 multiplied by 8.8 and u should find the answer to be 167.2!

AA10927246	For example:  S(n) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... + 1/(2^n)    This series is convergent because the sum converges on the value 1.  Each time you add a term it gets closer and closer to 1, but it will never go above 1.    On the other hand, a divergent series just grows without hitting a limit.  For example:  S(n) = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/n    As you add terms, the series just gets bigger and bigger.  It may slow down but ultimately it grows toward infinity, if you just keep adding enough terms.|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	When you take the limit n tending to infinity, convergent sequence has a finite limit, whereas the divergent sequence tends to infinity.|`|vstPqo6Saa	convergent means when the squence exists and converge to a real number, then we call convergent.    divergent means if you can't find the squence converge to a real number then it is divergent.  if the sequence converge to an infinity, it still counts as divergent.     opposite of convergent.

85yI99bGaa	Basically the idea is that as n gets big the two functions have similar behavior in their growth.  It's probably easier to look for C if you consider dividing both sides by g and  looking at    Limit as n-> infinity of f(n)/g(n)    so for your f(n) and g(n) just look at    {3n-100} / {5n+n^2}     as n gets big the limit goes to zero which would mean C = 0.  You really don't want to set C to zero, but what that means is that g grows so much faster than f that ANY constant will work for the problem you gave.    Some more illustrative examples would be     f(n) = 3 n^2  and g(n) = 2 n^2 + n    now if you look at f(n) / g(n) the limit is just 3/2 so you could use that as your C    if you take your original f and g and switch their places you get    the limit of  {5n+n^2} / {3n-100}  as n -> infinity    the limit also tends to infinity and that tells you you'd need C to go to infinity as well.  Since infinity isn't a real number, this tells you that 5n+2n^2 is NOT O(3 n - 100)    Again, the whole idea behind this is to help describe how things grow or decay as n goes to some number.  It's along the same lines as finding asymptotes for graphs.  There you were essentially doing the same thing and this is just kind of extending that idea.

LN07HZLsaa	I think you're problem is:     [x  (8x  x2  15)] dx    So to integrate this, you must use substitution method. If you will try to look which of the two components of the fraction makes the equation "difficult", then it must be the denominator:    If we let u be equal to 8x  x2  15, that is the denominator, and differentiate all sides, we will have:    u = 8x  x2  15    d/dx (u) = d/dx (8x  x2  15)    du/dx = (1/2)(8x)(1) - 2x    Then equating du,    du = 4x - 2x dx    and    du = 2x dx    Now we have value for du which is equal to 2x dx. If we try to examine the numerator, we have only x. So we need to multiply 2 on the numerator, BUT divide the whole integration by 2 so that the multiplication of two and division of 2 will never affect the equation.    (1/2)  [2x  (8x  x2  15) dx    Now, we have du = 2x dx and u = x  (8x  x2  15)    Hence, our substituted equation would be:      (1/2)  (du/u)    Simplifying,    (1/2)  (u^-1) du     Now we know that the integration of u^-1 or 1/u is ln |u| + C.Therefore,    (1/2) ln |u| + C    And bringing back the value of u which is x  (8x  x2  15), we have    [ln | (x  8x  x2  15 dx) | ]/2 + C    or    ln |x| - ln | 8x  x2  15 | + C    ______________________________________...

I'm using coordinate geometry here if that is ok with you.  definitely   take AB as the y axis and BC as the x axis. the angle AC makes with BC is arctan(3/4)  so slope of line AC is 3/4.  The eq of AC can be written as y=3x/4+c  the point at which it cuts the x axis must be (-4,0), so c = 3.  The point D is equidistant from the x, y axes and the line y=3x/4+3.  on solving, this point comes out to be (20/7,20/7)  similarily, F is (-60/11,60/11) and E is (-20/17,-20/17)  putting these in the determinant formula for the area of a triangle, you will get the answer, which i am getting as 57600/1309.|`|31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    The area of ?ABC = ?(3)(4) = 6    Since D, E, and F are the midpoints of the 3 sides, when you connect them, the mid-segments split ?ABC into 4 congruent right triangles, each of which have an area of 6/4 = 1.5.

You'll see one of them is negative, so if your problem must have a positive integer answer e.g. a count of some set of objects, then the negative may be discarded.    The question posed must therefore be one that can only give a small positive integer in order to have an unambiguous result. I can think of something like that, so I guess you can too.

Also, practically it is not possible to create such a low temperature, and even if temperatures close to absolute zero can be attained, no substance can exist in the gaseous state at this temperature.

QPWjtDzcaa	In general, the full moon closest to the december solstice (the June solstice for the southern hemisphere) at roughly midnight local time, will produce the highest (from the horizon) full moon.    This becomes less accurate between roughly 29 degrees N and 29 degrees S latitude, as the full moon can lie north OR south of directly overhead on these dates from those locations.  At the equator, a full moon would be roughly at your zenith on either equinox (at approx. midnight local time).    But for most places on the globe, the answer is "in the winter."|`|UFteXlqwaa	Because the sun has also some gravitational effect on the moon, it is in orbit around the earth with a declination of only +5 to -5 degrees on the ecliptic, i.e. the earth orbit around the sun.    If you ignore the moon declination that follows a cycle not related to the seasons (declination of the sun) then, using the moon at node points ( 0 degrees declination) the full moon at its meridian passage (midnight, solar time) the highest when the sun is the highest, i.e. at the summer solstice. The moon is then 90 - your latitude + 23.5 degrees above the horizon.|`|5H7Wgaknaa	The full moon is opposite the Sun. Therefore it occupies an area of sky which the Sun would occupy six months later.

UaVEKjJ8aa	yes the square root of any non-perfect square is an irrational number.  By definition a rational number is one which can be expressed in the form p/q where both p and q are natural numbers.

On the other hand root2 which is also a recurring decimal cannot be expressed in the form p/q, hence it is irrational|`|j7MVgF6laa	If a whole number is not a perfect Nth power, its Nth root is irrational.

If you plotted the graph of the function f(x) = x2 - 9 you'd see it's in negative territory for x between -3 and + 3. That piece of the real number field is excluded from f(x) when f is a real-valued function, but not if it's a complex function.

UFteXlqwaa	Hectopascal is the metric standard unit of pressure. It replaces but is equivalent to the millibar that was a thousand of a bar. The latter being roughly the pressure of one atmosphere (in fact, the Standard Atmosphere (SA) is 1,013.25 hPa).    If you are reading a weather map then the hectopascals are the pressures written along the isobar lines; i.e. lines of equal pressure. If you are American, chances are that they are written in inches of Mercury (SA is then 29.9 Hg In).

TL1Jkqunaa	Yes.   But Vivianne T claimed it should be called climate change.  SHe is wrong.    The sudden widespread use of the phrase global climate change come from a study done by Republican PArty public relations work, before the 2004 campaign.  They did a series of sensitivity studies and found that while people reacted with thought and worry to global warming most people found global climate change less threatening, almost neutral.  The NAtional Republican party then sent out flayers to all its candidates saying to avoid talking about warming and use the phrase Global climate change.  They knew they were talking about the same thing but wanted to downplay its effect.      Global warming is a fact, so is gravity, so is evolution.  But the theories explaining may not be agreed upon.  (Actually both gravity and evolution have more or less universal acceptance among people that work with them.)|`|707gOCvbaa	I would not call it global warming but the Planet is doing what it has done for millions of years and it's called Change.

Wow, you are really really really ignorant.    First of all, please learn the difference between *climate* and *weather*. Weather is what we get from day to day: will it be hot or cold tomorrow, will it rain or snow, or what.  Climate is the long-term systems that affect the whole world.    Secondly, no-one ever said that 'global warming' means that every bit of the earth will get hotter. On the contrary. What it means is that the climate (that word again) is disrupted. Here in the UK we have always enjoyed much warmer temperatures than we should 'naturally' get, given how far north we are, because of the impact of the Gulf Stream. Compare our mild weather with what they get in Norway, which is at pretty much the same latitude as us. If the Gulf Stream moved, we would suddenly get very much colder.    Global warming threatens the stability of all the world's climate, but that doesn't mean we won't occasionally get some snow.

The polar ice caps are still melting though.|`|e89ce7ca62eb7c9cb821e257ed2591e9aa	Global warming and global cooling have taken place over the last 4.6 billion years (age of the earth) which is the fluctuation in temperature. Ice at the poles is not always the result of global temperature variation, as there has been global cooling events in the past which don't result in ice caps.  Nature is mostly influenced by positive feedback mechanisms; thus each reaction causes a knock effect. For example, release of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere traps the suns rays into the atmosphere and reflects them to the surface, causing a local rise in temperature. This increase in temperature causes melting of Methane Hydrates (Methane stored in ice and pelagic sediments), thus releasing methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas and traps more sun rays, increasing the temperature further, melting more methane hydrates and so on.  This is known as global warming, however large amounts of erosion on continental crust, uses massive amounts of CO2 which is removed from the atmosphere and stored in the rocks. (This occured after India collided with Eurasia, the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau were eroded.)    Global warming definately exists, but in equal amounts so does global cooling. The fear is that humans have interupted the removal of CO2 by replacing it when burning fossil fuels. (Around 60% of the Earths CO2 is locked up in Calcareous  rocks (limestone) and in organic hard exoskeletons.  Global warming will happen, irrespective of what humans do, however its effects can only be suggested by scientists, particularly geologists who study past global temperature variations.  Who is to say that we wont become extinct before the ice completely melts, mass extinction events are catastrophic and wipe out much of the Earths life.

And that is probably the model of the Universe that we feel closest to now. But it could also be finite, because it could be that the Universe has a very large volume now, but finite, and that that volume will increase, so only in the infinite future will it actually be infinite.

Confusing, right??|`|gg2aJXoDaa	Technically, travelling to the edge of the universe is impossible - it requires travelling faster than the speed of light, and that, my little macaroon cannot be done.    However, to entertain your question - what would happen if we DID travel to the edge of space and push our heads "through the curtain" so to speak? Well - the answer is either very groovy or imensely disappointing, depending on how you look at it. You see, it's wrong to think of the universe as an ever expanding object, getting bigger and bigger into a void - for this reason: There is no void for it to expand into! The universe, does in fact bend and twist in ways that don't really bear thinking about, and it means that if you ever tried to go beyond the edge of the universe, you'd end up back where you started -    It's a bit like taking a person that had only ever lived on a perfectly flat plane and then putting them on a sphere - they'd walk in a straight line and be at a complete loss to explain how they ended up back where they started. Going past the edge of the universe is the same for us - we just struggle to process that.    As for your other question - noone knows if gravity will eventually make everything collapse in on itself.

Probably why Einstein thought space was made of some fabric that wraps around massive objects. If it were, it would create a drag on super massive objects traveling through it. There cannot be any limit to space, only the amount of matter in it. Therefore, the edge of our known universe would be empty space from there to infinity.

I see beauty in all kinds of things and I don't have your problem.    3) You don't actually like the way you look.  If you can find the beauty in other things while on DXM, this is somthing to look into.

If it is not trivial, make a fresh sequence using the number sequence that come out from differencing every possible adjacent pair and try out the difference on this sequence.

Before that, we don't know, because the laws of physics break down.    But if you say x created y, then you can always ask what created x.    So you either have to accept a first event, with no cause (or it wouldn't be a first event). Or you have to accept that we can go back infinitely in time. Or you have to accept that time is not linear.    All of which are counter-intuitve, but you have to accept one or the other. If you just say "God", then you have to ask how God was created. You're no further forward.|`|bxlYleZkaa	They don't. It is all conjecture and conflicting opinions. Statistics and Equations can prove, or disprove, anything, but that does not necessarily mean that that proof, or otherwise, is correct.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Physics doesn't even try to "explain the birth of the universe."      Physics is more like this:  Your car is here, and it going at 50 miles a hour, and there is nothing to slow it down or speed it up.  Therefore, one hour ago the car must have been 50 miles back up the road.  The car factory is 500 miles back up the road, so 10 hours ago the car must have come from the factory.  Trying to figure out where the car was before that is useless.  It's also useless to try to explain the "birth" of the car.

bzhpRYOoaa	You all forgot to mention the opportunities to work with animals in a volunteer capacity. I spent 7 years volunteering at a big cat rescue. Of course there is a lot of cleaning, picking up poo and preparing food, which can be gross if you don't like working with raw meat, but there is also a huge pay off as far as the animals go. After undergoing extensive training, I was able to raise lions, tigers, cougars and leopards from cubs and also get to work with other animals the rescue took in such as crocodiles, alligators, cayman, civets and genets. There is nothing to compare to bottle feeding a tiger cub, playing ball with a leopard or giving a 500lb lion a belly rub. Most rescue organizations start their volunteers out on cleaning and things like that so they can monitor them and let them learn from the handlers. After a few months,  I did public educational exhibits which meant I got to take big cats out to public events, handle them on a chain and interact with the public, giving speeches and answering questions while sitting next to one of our ambassador lions. If you are dedicated and a hard worker,maybe an animal rescue is something you would have a lot of fun doing.|`|FD8I4zthaa	Cleaning out cages and disposing of the dead animals isn't very pleasant.    Edit: Penguin. Not sure that any animal really understands enough to know that anyone has 'saved their life' let alone be able to show 'gratitude'.|`|YNVNnI0haa	Its amazing  I have done multiple things from saving animals lives which they reward with much gratitude   also to help an animal give birth is amazing  All that you get to do is so wonderful|`|xopIi2Vfaa	depends on the animal. Looking after insects in a zoo can be fun if you like insects. But it is mainly cleaning cages. In general most zoo keeper jobs have more to do with cleaning. Unless it is an animal which needs training as an enrichment zoos try to minimize contact. And even animals which get a lot of enrichment like e.g. gorillas you wouldn't be allowed to pet them.   Looking after horses in a stable is also mainly mucking out, feeding and cleaning them. Putting them onto a pastures and getting them off it. It also means getting up really early in the morning.   Looking after animals in an animal shelter is a lot of cleaning cages, cleaning animals, but also walking dogs or playing with cats. Though most animal shelters have volunteers to help with those jobs, so if you get a job there, you probably get stuck with more cleaning jobs.     If you are an animal trainer you will get much more interaction, but there are very few jobs as animal trainers and a lot of people interested to do them.     Or you can do medical research. They also employ somebody to keep rats and mice (rarely something else. Then you have to know all the rules and probably safety procedures. If you do research, you probably see the mouse more in the form of a cell suspension or as a liver with cancer cells.

aP2ipf64aa	In each case, the cost of manufacture is the fixed cost plus the unit cost of jeans multiplied by the number of jeans produced.    SO, if we say that Mydney produces M pairs of jeans, and Selbourne produces S pairs of jeans, and we want the manufacturing costs to be equal then:    28000 + M*30 = 35000 + S*24    which rearranges to     30M - 24S = 7000  -- (A)    we also know that we want 6000 pairs of jeans total, so:    M + S = 6000 -- (B)    You've now got yourself a pair of simultaneous equations (A and B) which you can solve in the normal manner:    M = 6000 - S, so substituting we get    30 * (6000 - S)  - 24S = 7000  =>  180000 - 54S = 7000  =>  173000 = 54S  => S = 3204  (rounding up)    Substitute back into B to get M.    Check the sums, I did it in my head ;)
AA10332086	I have built thousands of foundations for various kinds of rotating equipment ranging from 10 horsepower to 25,000 horsepower. The foundations were always installed within the tolerances of a carpenter's level.     That is because the rotating equipment is then shimmed very carefully using a machinist's level and dial indicator to bring the various pieces into tolerance. Many times after this is done the equipment is grouted to provide adjustment between the foundation and the base of the equipment.    As an example: A large centrifugal pump would typically not need to be perfectly level to function properly but you would need the driver and the pump to be aligned so the coupling is within about 2 thousands total indicated run out. Some coupling have a greater tolerance but 2 thousands is a good rule of thumb.    On a structure like an offshore platform, you are usually dealing with equipment mounted on a skid. In that case, typically the skid is set to within a 1/16" or better and then shims are added under the skid or the equipment to bring the pieces of equipment into alignment. The method of measuring alignment really doesn't change what you do or the tolerances.|`|Gt5JzC2Daa	tolerance will depend on the particular application.Most equipment will have some form of levelling device(or be able to use shims), to take up any difference from ideal. You'll have to be within that range of adjustment, to ensure you can get "dead flat".    There's a VERY simple way of defining level, which will work over any reasonable distance, and irrespective any "bumps". Use a clear flexible hose pipe, and fill it with liquid. Once any oscillations settle down the heights the liquid levels are above a datum, will be identical.    That method will only define two points to be level, and define a flat line. But it can be extended to as many points as you wish. to define a reference plane, you only need a third point (although 4 points might be most convient). Just cut the tube (below the water level!), insert a t-piece, and add another section of hose, and fill with liquid, and the liquid levels will still all be the same height above a datum.     To find the amount of slope, you need to measure the distance between the points, and the height differences between the reference fluid level and the points on the surface you are interested in. Then use trig to work it out    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometr...

There are also formal sciences (math) and applied sciences (engineering).    I can give a better answer if you know the particular science is being studied or if this is just a general sciences course.

6zhw1zd0aa	But that's the whole point.  You can't eliminate all friction.  If you could, all sorts of perpetual motion machines would be possible.  Just the same as if you eliminated all other sorts of energy loss!|`|9v31wUz1aa	There will always be friction - even in a vacuum - even the flexing of the string in a simple bob pendulum uses energy.|`|ce19c1260edf0d3a1518357241a61fa6aa	They are right:  if you could do it the pendulum would not run down.  But this is not the same thing as the impossibility of perpetual motion.    There are fundamental things stopping you though:  Just as you can't get absolute zero temperature so absolute zero pressure is impossible, hence you can't produce a perfect vacuum.    Changing theories there is also the gas of virtual particles in a vacuum.|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	If the pendulum were in a perfect vacuum and it was possible to produce a frictionless hinge then it's a theoretical possibility it could go on forever.    What has not been  mentioned however is the effect of gravity on the weight, which in my humble opinion would add another force and eventually stop it, so I think your machine would also have to be in a weightless state.|`|r6OQkyIGaa	If the hinge was friction free - it wouldn't be a hinge.    But otherwise yes, it would go on.    Perpetual motion is impossible.  1+1=2.  Add anything = friction in motion = unstable = stop. 1 of 1 perpetual.  You can not make 1 of 1 in any equation = perpetual motion not possible. Oh, except in division.  So I guess you could travel back in time perpetually.  But then  time is relative, and therefore NOT perpetual. No.|`|92d6e348e5e80228908a047d4e3c40a8aa	It wouldn't stop. But it's impossible to make this.
4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	Because that's the only way they can avoid crashing into the nucleus because of electrostatic attraction, colliding with a proton to form a neutron via electron capture.  It's the same way the moon avoids crashing into the earth from gravitational attraction.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	electromagnetism is the fundamental force that act between particles base on their charge    positive and positive push each other away, same goes for negative charge    But negative and positive charge attract each other    In the classic model of atom, because the core of the atom is positive (proton is positive) while electron is negative charged, there is a force between them.     But the electron itself has energy that keeps it from falling into the core of the atom, so it moves around it instead.    If you mean why electron move in a conductor or semicondutor, thats simply because they are attracted to positive charge.|`|DrwY7dJCaa	Because they have kinetic energy.|`|w8VrwJ0naa	i think they move because they have kinetic energy.
CCeRdaoLaa	Point of note: parrots aren't mammals.    I see what you mean, though.  I don't think there's necessarily a correlation between the two, though.  In my opinion, there are many other species that are better whistlers than parrots and humans.  Songbirds produce whistles much like parrots, but in much greater complexity (and some, like chickadees, can communicate complex information with their songs).  Many other mammals, like whales and dolphins, make greater and more complex use of whistling than humans.|`|aaC2Qx1Uaa	It isn't the *reason* - but it is related.  The ability to whistle (either by blowing through pursed lips, like humans, or by any other vocalisation means) is related to the ability to produce a wide range of sounds. And being able to produce a wide range of sounds allows sophisticated vocal communication, such as humans use.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	have you ever heard the term: songbird?    Listen to birds in your yard sometime. Spring is about the right time for listening to bird song. Then come back about the whistling capabilities of humans. I think it's pretty bad in comparison...|`|8xVGuEDkaa	Parrots don't speak, they mimic. Although it seems like they are talking they have a similar set of vocal chords that allow them to mimic what they hear. they have no idea what they are saying tho.
yxnUBSJqaa	Transistors are electronic devices made of semiconductor material that amplify a signal or open or close a circuit. Invented in 1947 at Bell Labs, transistors have become the key ingredient of all digital circuits, including computers. It is the solid-state analog to the triode electron tube; the transistor has replaced the electron tube for virtually all-common applications. The transistor is an arrangement of semiconductor materials that share common physical boundaries. Materials most commonly used are silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium, into which a process called doping has introduced impurities. In n-type semiconductors the impurities or dopants result in an excess of electrons, or negative charges.  In p-type semiconductors the dopants lead to a deficiency of electrons and therefore an excess of positive charge carriers or "holes.      Junction bipolar transistors (BJT) have two main functional designs:  n-p-n and p-n-p junction transistors. n-p-n transistors consist of two n-type semiconductors (called the emitter and collector) separated by a thin layer of p-type semiconductor (called the base). The transistor action is such that if the electric potentials on the segments are properly determined, a small current between the base and emitter connections results in a large current between the emitter and collector connections, thus producing current amplification. Some circuits are designed to use the transistor as a switching device; current in the base-emitter junction creates a low-resistance path between the collector and emitter. p-n-p junction transistors consist of a thin layer of n-type semiconductor lying between two p-type semiconductors, works in the same manner, except that all polarities are reversed.      Field-effect transistors were developed after the junction transistor is the field-effect transistor (FET). They draw virtually no power from an input signal, overcoming a major disadvantage of the junction transistor. An n-channel FET consists of a bar (channel) of n-type semiconductor material that passes between and makes contact with two small regions of p-type material near its center. The terminals attached to the ends of the channel are called the source and the drain; those attached to the two p-type regions are called gates. A voltage applied to the gates is directed so that no current exists across the junctions between the p- and n-type materials; for this reason it is called a reverse voltage. Variations of the magnitude of the reverse voltage cause variations in the resistance of the channel, enabling the reverse voltage to control the current in the channel. A p-channel device works the same way but with all polarities reversed.     Metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is a variant in which a single gate is separated from the channel by a layer of metal oxide, which acts as an insulator, or dielectric. The electric field of the gate extends through the dielectric and controls the resistance of the channel. In this device the input signal, which is applied to the gate, can increase the current through the channel as well as decrease it.|`|4fWZL4TRaa	A Bipolar Junction Transistor uses a small current in the base-emitter circuit as the input to control a larger current in the collector-emitter circuit as the output. It can be used as a switch (off or on) or an amplifier. These functions are the basis of all the other applications.    A Field Effect Transistor uses a voltage between the gate and source to control the current between the source and drain. It can also be used as a switch or an amplifier.    There are complementary types also - meaning they operate with the opposite polarities. These are known as NPN or N channel, and PNP or P channel, respectively. These are made with doped semiconductor materials known as N or P type for the mechanism of electrical current transfer.    The link below has more details.

TKHHRUB4aa	The discussion as to whether societies are organisms andvice versa has been going on for a long time. The question is meaningless unless a clear definition of the term organism is made. Once such a definition is made, the question may be answered by studying whether there exists any relational isomorphism between what the biologist calls an organism and what the sociologist calls society. Such a study should also include animal societies studied by ecologists. Both human and animal societies are sets of individuals together with certain other objects which are the products of their activities. A multicellular organism is a set of cells together with some products of their activities. A cell itself may be regarded as a set of genes together with the products of their activities because every component of the cell is either directly or indirectly the result of the activities of the genes. Thus it is natural to define both biological and social organisms as special kinds of sets. A number of definitions are given in this paper which define what we call here organismic sets. Postulates are introduced which characterize such sets, and a number of conclusions are drawn. It is shown that an organismic set, as defined here, does represent some basic relational aspects of both biological organisms and societies. In particular a clarification and a sharpening of the Postulate of Relational Forces given previously (Bull. Math. Biophysics,28, 283308, 1966) is presented. It is shown that from the basic definitions and postulates of the theory of organismic sets, it folows that only such elements of those sets will aggregate spontaneously, which are not completely specialized in the performance of only one activity. It is further shown that such non-specialized elements undergo a process of specialization, and as a result of it their spontaneous aggregation into organismic sets becomes impossible. This throws light on the problem of the origin of life on Earth and the present absence of the appearance of life by spontaneous generation. Some applications to problems of ontogenesis and philogenesis are made. Finally the relation between physics, biology, and sociology is discussed in the light of the theory of organismic sets.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	You end up with a small lump of undifferentiated cells instead of an organism.  Since there's no differentiation, there's a limit to how big it can get, since it won't have a circulatory system to bring oxygen and nutrients to the inside of the lump.    Some cells can be artificially kept like this:  for animals, that would be an embryonic stem cell line.    For plants, that would be "meristem culture."  These lumps of meristem can be cultured, and when removed from culture can then differentiate and form a little plant!  These days, that's the preferred method for cloning prized orchids.

79aoEHMBaa	Here is the actual meaning:  Folding - A bend that develops in an initially horizontal layer of rock, usually caused by plastic deformation. Folds occur most frequently in sedimentary rocks.    Here it is in more simple terms:    If you were riding a bicycle and ran into a large rock the metal on your bike might snap or it might bend. This happens with the the earth's plates collide as well.     When two plates are pushing against one another the rock layers may buckle creating giant folds in the rock. There are several different types of folds: Here is a diagram showing simple folding and the 2nd one shows the different types:  http://earthsci.org/education/teacher/ba...  http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...

QPWjtDzcaa	There are two forms of retrograde motion.  Apparent and true.    All 8 planets orbit the sun in prograde orbits...  as in...  NOT retrograde.  They only appear to be "moving backwards across the background stars in the sky" (retrograde) because the earth and those planets are all orbiting the sun, and doing so at different rates.      It is unlikely that any of theplanets in our solar system will ever "reverse orbit."  It would take a great interaction...  either a nasty collision with a very massive (and currently unknown) object, or very precise gravitational interactions with (again, a hypothetical) large mass object.    Earth, as viewed from any other planet, will have an "apparent" retrograde motion from their sky.  Most often, retrograde is talked about when viewing superior planets.  As we "gain on them" near their opposition dates, they slow down, and then stop, and then backtrack.  This is all because of the relative motion of us and them.  Inferior planets will appear to move in retrograde after they have reached their "greatest eastern elongation" (from the sun in our sky).      Being on earth, we cannot observe earth to have an apparent retrograde motion.  It would be like being in a car that is moving at a constant speed and always forward, sometimes passing other cars and sometimes being passed by other cars on a racetrack.  But no matter how long you are in your car, you never see it "moving backwards" relative to you on that racetrack.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Practically never.|`|lO0keUAUaa	You would have to be observing the Earth from the vicinity of the planets Venus or Mercury to see it undergo retrograde motion.|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Frequently if you observe from an inner planet.  Less frequently if you watch from an outer planet.  But the earth does not change its orbital motion, nor does any planet-  barring massive collisions.  Seen from below or above the orbital plane no planet shows retrograde motion, they all show ellipses.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Relative to what? Earth would only "appear" to go retrograde from a viewpoint somewhere else in our solar system.

A really active transposable element could, therefore, disrupt the metabolism of its host cell enough to kill the host cell.  This would result in that transposable element not leaving any descendants, right?  In this way, deleterious transposable elements would tend not to be passed to the host organism's progeny.
TMB4d3FAaa	Geographic approximations to large bodies of water like the Great Lakes on their Eastern and Southern shores tend to be referred to a "Snow Belts" by meteorologists.  The Coriolis effect moves the weather patterns in a mostly easterly direction.  The high and low systems rotational winds act as part of the condition. The wind moving over a body of water say .Lake Michigan, picks up considerable moisture. As this moisture laden air goes over the cooler adjoining land mass it turns to snow.

Wz9tSKTaaa	This is a puzzling question. The other answer is good, but it depends what you need...    Can the child prove paternity? The answer is always no - blood types are far too common to prove a specific father. At best, it can be used to eliminate some possible fathers, or show that it's possible for someone to have children of a particular type. The latter is true here: the 'father' must have a hidden O allele (gene-version) from his O parent (as O alleles are the only alleles O types have to pass on), and so he is capable of having an O child - with anyone that anyone else could have an O type child with.    However, the mother being _homozygous_ B is a weird fact, because that would mean she only has B alleles to pass on (no hidden O alleles) and therefore generally speaking couldn't be the mother of an O type child, who needs an O from each parent. It's also a fact you can rarely be certain of from inheritance alone (2 AB type parents who had a B child could be sure it was homozygous, but that's unusual). Are you sure you didn't mean the opposite, heterozygous?     Bombay blood would allow for someone to test as O type despite a homozygous B mother, but aside from being extremely rare it would mean throwing all the ABO blood typing stuff out of the window. A, B, AB and O all test as O on standard tests if someone is Bombay phenotype.|`|LVJjGaJ3aa	If the grandparents are A and O, and the father is A, then he must be AO. Also, the mom is homozygous B, which means she is BB. Now, from crossing of AO and BB, we see that the child can be OB but not homozygous OO. So, to be a O type, the B allele in the child must somehow be recessive or non-functional. When B is not working in OB, we get a Bombay phenotype, which is exactly what is happening to the kid. So, it is possible to claim the kid as the child of the parents by genotyping his O allele with his dad which he got from his mom. But the case is so rare that it could be a little hard to prove.
TKHHRUB4aa	DNA is the keeper of the all the information   needed to recreate an organism. All DNA is made up of a base consisting of sugar, phosphate and one nitrogen base. There are four nitrogen bases, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The nitrogen   bases are found in pairs, with A & T and G & C paired together. The sequence of the nitrogen bases can be arranged in an infinite ways, and their structure is known as the famous "double helix" which  is shown in the image below. The sugar used in DNA is deoxyribose. The four nitrogen bases are the same for all organisms. The sequence and number of bases is what creates diversity.  DNA does not actually make the organism, it only makes  proteins. The DNA is transcribed into mRNA and mRNA is translated into protein, and the protein  then forms the organism. By changing  the DNA sequence, the way in which the  protein is   formed changes. This leads to either a different protein, or an inactive protein.     Now that we know what DNA is, this is where the recombinant comes in.   Recombinant DNA is the general name for taking a piece of one DNA, and   and combining it with another strand of DNA. Thus, the name recombinant!   Recombinant DNA is also sometimes referred to as "chimera." By combining two or   more different strands of DNA, scientists are able to create a new strand of DNA.   The most common recombinant process involves combining the DNA of two   different organisms.     How is Recombinant DNA made?   There are three different methods by which Recombinant DNA is made. They are   Transformation, Phage Introduction, and Non-Bacterial Transformation. Each   are described separately below.     Transformation  The first step in transformation is to select a piece of DNA to be inserted   into a vector. The second step is to cut that piece of DNA with a restriction   enzyme and then ligate the DNA insert into the vector with DNA Ligase. The insert contains a selectable   marker which allows for identification of recombinant molecules. An antibiotic   marker is often used so a host cell without a vector dies when exposed to a certain   antibiotic, and the host with the vector will live because it is resistant.     The vector is inserted into a host cell, in a process called transformation. One   example of a possible host cell is E. Coli. The host cells must be specially   prepared to take up the foreign DNA.     Selectable markers can be for antibiotic resistance, color changes, or any other   characteristic which can distinguish transformed hosts from untransformed hosts.   Different vectors have different properties to make them suitable to different   applications. Some properties can include symmetrical cloning sites, size, and   high copy number.

Make the best one you can, based on the knowledge you have. You can wonder but it doesn't pay to waste time on it.|`|AA11641349	Yeah, I think about it once in a while.  8 years ago my husband hurt his back very badly.  He can't sit for longer than 45 minutes (he has to get up and move), he can't carry anything more than 15 lbs., and sometimes for no apparent reason his back will go out and he can only shuffle around for days until the spasms stop.  This happened when he was 31.  It changed our lives drastically, I have to take out the trash, I have to bring in anything that's heavy when we go shopping (like cases of water), we can't drive anywhere far because he can't make the trip by the time we get there, even if we take frequent breaks to stretch, his back ends up spasming and he misses work for 3 days.  We can't stay long at parties because he gets just as uncomfortable standing as he does sitting.  So sometimes, I go back and forth between is it worth it for me to stay in a relationship where I have to do everything and he gets to sit/stand around watching me do it.  What would have happened if I had the nerve to leave 8 years ago when I first realized what it was really going to be like?  I don't resent him, I've gotten over it, especially when I can actually see the muscles in his back all swollen and he walks around hunched over because he tried to carry the laundry basket upstairs for me.  We learned to adjust and live with it.
ObKQjziLaa	salts are made up of ionic bonds. Thus these salts readily dissociate into their respective ions in water breaking their ionic bond. Thus the crystal structure breaks  ex: NaCl in water --> Na+ + Cl-  It has dissociated into its ions. This is how our common salt dissolves in water and even our mouth!?
SvmZlLdaaa	Generally, the American lion, though a male Siberian tiger would have a fair chance against a female American lion. The American lion and the cave lion of Europe were the largest cats that ever lived, being up to a third larger than a modern lion. This makes them larger and correspondingly stronger than a Siberian tiger.    Your first answer is mistaken on several points. Aside from the odd obese captive individual, maximum weight of Siberian tiger is 300kg, not 800kg! Tigers are not 'highly active and energetic' and lions 'lethargic'. Both tigers and lions may spend 20 hours a day sleeping or resting, which is not laziness, but an efficient use of energy. If you only eat once a week or so, and must expend a lot of energy to catch that meal, it makes sense to conserve energy at other times. Besides the fact that ability to withstand cold has no bearing on the outcome of a fight between two animals, the American lion lived during the last Ice Age - it was just as able to withstand cold as the Siberian tiger is. As to tree-climbing (which again has little impact on the outcome of a fight), both tigers and lions are generally too heavy to be particularly agile climbers, but males and females of both species can and do climb on occasion. Male lions can certainly climb - here is an image of one in a tree:  http://wildernessafrica.com/blog/wp-cont...|`|S7namHBeaa	tiger in snow, lion in space, tie in dry land, tiger in water|`|PTqNlQHKaa	definitely,the siberian tiger wins because its weight is about 800kgs. whereas the american lion weighs about 850kgs..moreover,the siberian tiger is ferocious,highly active and energetic and it withstood even the coldest climate of russia,so it has high resistant capacity over the lions of america.as far we know,america is not as cold as russia,moreover the lions have long hairs,long fur,scaly skin,less energetic by nature,lethargic in nature.one more advantage is that the lionesses can only climb trees which the lions could not do so because of heavy musculolipids,whereas both tigresses and tigers can attack from the trees,tigers have heavy musculolipids.|`|eBVIeTreaa	siberian tiger would win because the shear viciousness of it

R0Ogy5qlaa	I've thought a long time about the first one and I can't find a proof.  Sorry.  Maybe you can email some info when you find out the answer.      2)  It is well known that hyperboloids can be generated by connecting two circles together with straight lines that lie along the sides of a cylinder, and then twisting the two circles in opposite directions.  Some art is based on this.      Let's pick the line that goes through (a,0,0) on the hyperboloid.  Then this line has parametric equations     x = a + kt    y = mt    z = nt.    Plug these into the equation (x^2 + y^2)/a^2  z^2/b^2 = 1 and we have    (a^2 + 2akt + k^2t^2 + m^2t^2)/a^2 - n^2t^2/b^2 = 1    1 + 2kt/a + k^2t^2/a^2 + m^2t^2/a^2 - n^2t^2/b^2 = 1    2kt/a + k^2t^2/a^2 + m^2t^2/a^2 - n^2t^2/b^2 = 0    Now this is supposed to be an identity, true for all t.  That implies that coefficients of corresponding powers of t from each side must match.  So    2k/a = 0 and    k^2/a^2 + m^2/a^2 - n^2/b^2 = 0.    The first equation tells us that k = 0 and putting that into the second yields    m^2/a^2 - n^2/b^2 = 0    m^2/a^2 = n^2/b^2    m/a = +-n/b.    So one of the many lines that lie along the hyperboloid has direction vector  = .      Now technically none of these lines crosses the z-axis so none of them makes an angle with it.  But I'm going to assume that the intended question is, what angle does the line make with the vertical direction?  This has an answer and it's the same for every one of the lines in question.  Just find the angle between the vectors  and .    cos theta =  dot /(|| * ||)     = b / (1*sqrt(a^2 + b^2)) = b / sqrt(a^2 + b^2)    So the angle is cos^{-1} (b / sqrt(a^2 + b^2)).      3)  After the nth step, the length of the rope is n + 1.  So with each step it has been increased by the factor (n + 1)/n.      Consider the distance that the bug has left to go.  With the nth step, this distance has been reduced by .01 meters and then increased by the factor (n + 1)/n.  So the formula for the distance left to go after the nth step must be    d = n + 1 - .01(n + 1) - .01(n + 1)/2 - .01(n + 1)/3 - ... - .01(n + 1)/n.    The terms of the form .01(n + 1)/k occur because the .01 that got subtracted in the kth step then got multiplied by (k + 1)/k, (k + 2)/(k + 1), (k + 3)/(k + 2), and so on up to (n + 1)/n.  In the product of all these factors there is a lot of cancellation and what is left is .01(n + 1)/k.    Then factor n + 1 out from the formula for d.    d = (n + 1)(1 - .01 - .01/2 - .01/3 - ... - .01/n)    d = (n + 1)(1 - .01(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n))    So d will reach 0 when .01(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) surpasses 1, i.e., when the harmonic sum H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n surpasses 100.  There is no good way to solve this exactly for n, but we can use the fact that the harmonic sum is closely approximated by ln(n) + .5772 + 1/(2n).  (See the reference below.)    So we have ln(n) + .5772 is about 100 and therefore n, the number of steps the bug needs to take, is about e^99.4228.  The error in the estimate H_n = ln(n) + .5772 is about the amount the we rounded to get .5772 since the 1/2n term is obviously much, much smaller.  So our answer for the number of steps is     n = e^99.4228    with the accuracy implied by the number of significant figures in the exponent.|`|0DwHIBUbaa	Q1. Draw a convex hexagon and think about its properties. Look at all those parallels ! Doesn't that give you some inkling of how to do it?  Q2. You're on your own. I forgot how solid geometry works long ago.  Q3. Experiment with a line and a point. Think about where the bug will be after the first step as a proportion of the length. This proportion applies after the rope stretches. Now repeat this for its second step, as a proportion of the the mew length. Think about where the bug will be after that step and so on...|`|2829fc3908fa0227821db6afd34ac30baa	A3. I found the question interesting.  Lets assume that elongation happens just after the instance the bug finishes his step.      Hence just after he finishes 1st step the length is 100*1   After 2nd step the length is 100*2     This length after nth step = 100*n   As the rope elongates uniformly the amount of rope that he has already passed also increases.      the distance travelled in the 1st step after he has taken n step elongates to  = 1* n ( the length of the rope has gone from 1m to N m)    Distance travelled in 2nd step is now = 1*n/2 ( the length of the rope has gone from 2m to N m)    Therefore to go to the other side on Nth step    n+ n/2 + n/3 + ....n/n-1 = 100*n     therefore 1+1/2+ 1/3 + .....+ 1/r = 100  and we need to find if r is finite and if so what is the value.     now the series sum (1/n) diverges so the bug makes it to the other side.  eventually !!    further sum of the series lies between ln(n+1) and ln(n)+1     so the number of steps are between exp( 99) and exp(100)  which is   equivalent to  9.8*10^23 and 2.6*10^24

FBwK9s7Baa	The difference in voltage between the ends of the resistor produces an electric field. Any electrons which are able to move are then dragged towards the positive (+ve) end and pushed away from the negative (-ve) end. In a vacuum they'd get faster and faster until they smashed into the positive end. However, inside a material they find that the atoms keep getting in the way.    Each time the electrons bump into the atoms of material they tend to lose kinetic energy and bounce off at a random angle. As a result they keep being accellerated by the electric field and 'losing their way' each time they hit an atom. The overall effect is to make them tend to diffuse through the resistor. They squeeze their way passed the atoms, a bit like toothpaste in a tube when you squash it at one end. The harder you squeeze (apply a bigger electric field) the higher their average velocity. Since the current is just a measure of how quickly charge moves along the piece of material we find that the current we get is proportional to the applied voltage.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	It and lots of other electrons move about haphazardly from one metal atom to another but generally drifting toward the positive terminal of the cell.  In the cell, the electron participates in a chemical reaction that ends up with an electron at the negative terminal.
wvAhCsxqaa	if something is directly proportional to something else, that means that if you change the one thing by multiplying it by some constant (let's call it k), then the other thing increases by that same constant k.    an example of this is just a simple linear equation like:  y=2x  so whenever when x goes up by one, y goes up by 1 times the constant, 2.    in this situation, we can model it by the equation:    drift velocity = constant * current, or more clearly,    v = k * I      ------> (I is the current)    so if the current is originally ten, and the velocity is 1.6x10^-4, we can make this equation look like this:    1.6x10^-4=k*10    now, if we cut the number 10 in half, down to 5 amperes, no matter what k is the number on the other side will also be cut in half.    so the answer will by .8x10^-4 or 8x10^-5|`|Sw61kY7Saa	if its directly proportional half the current = the drift velocity

It is unavoidable that deforestation will continue.    To stop deforestation anywhere is to reduce world population.
V8jIAEmBaa	Consider the area of the pancake. It has a 200mm ID (d) and 5000mm OD (D). Since the area of a circle is pi*r^2 or 1/4* pi*d^2, taking the area of the whole thing a subtracting that of the reel, the area looking at it from the top is:    area = 1/4*pi*(D^2 - d^2) = 19,600,000 mm^2    dividing by 0.2mm strip thickness, length is:    length = 19.6e6mm / 0.2mm = 98 km    This is pretty long, are you sure the OD is 5000mm instead of 500mm?    Edit: I did the arithmetic 6 times; I still get 98km. Are you dividing by 0.2mm strip t, or 2.0mm strip t?
GGMKhDf5aa	Go for stoichiometry! Now, to go about solving this problem, you need to use ratios given to you by the formula, like 2 mols of ammonia react with 1 mol of sodium  Fun stuff.    For any limiting reagent problem, just take either one of the two (or more) reactants given to you. I personally prefer ammonia.    g NH3 used *   mol NH3/g NH3 *   mol NaClO/mols NH3 *  molecular mass of NaClO     ==> which gets you your limiting or excess. Say you get something above 300.0g of NaClO. Then you would know that NH3 is the excess reagent, because that's how much NaClO it would take to react with 170.0 g of NH3. But say you get less than 300. Then you know that 170g of NH3 wouldn't react with all of 300g of NaClO. I'm not going to calculate for you. But I did give you what you need to calculate it. So that takes care of 1) and 2).    The theoretical yield is stoichiometry, basically. You use your limiting reagent and compare the ratio in which it reacts to produce however much of N2H4. For example, if it was NaClO that was your limiting, then you would use:    g NaClO used *  g NaClO/mol NaClO *   mols NaClO/mols N2H4 *  molecular mass N2H4    ==> which would get you your theoretical yield. 3) is down. The actual yield is given in the problem for you. 105g. 4) is down.    For 5), all you do is you take your actual and divide that by your theoretical, and multiply the result by 100%.    6) and 7) both depend on what you get as your limiting reagent. If NH3 is your limiting reagent, then obviously all of it is going to get used up in the reaction. If NaClO is the limit, all of that is going to get used up. To calculate the excess, you're going to have to go back to grunt work stoichiometry. Take your limiting reagent, calculate how much of the excess reagent would react with it, and since what you get would be a smaller number than the grams used given in the problem, subtract that, and you have your "how much is left over."

Well, actually first... you can't really do it with only one IR LED, because you need to have at least 3 points to triangulate. Or I suppose 2 if you just offset the poition of the LEDS on the camera.     Anyways, I would really take a software approach to this. Embed the leds in the monitor, and then mount the webcam... on your face. After that, you can use the webcam to find the position of... you.    I would personally only use 2 leds for the simple reason that it will be less likely for you to lose one of them from sight of the camera and then mess up your software.     Anyways, embed 2 IR LEDS in the top rim of the montior, facing you. They only really need power, nothing else.    The webcam would take the video and analyze where those two points are.It can measure the distance between them to determine how far you are from the screen. More importantly, you know that these two points should always be at the top of the monitor, therefore, if they are not, you would adjust the pointer on screen to compensate for the displacement.     I would look into writing drivers, as that is definitly the path I would take!

The receptor detects a change (stimulus) in internal environment. Then, the receptor sends the message (impulse) to the control centre, and the control centre processes the information/message and brings about an appropriate response by the effector.     Thus, it means that the receptor organ detect changes that occur in internal environment, and effector organ brings response from control centre to control the changes so that the internal environment returns to normal.

82a60dc48805ec31cf7fc104867ad3dbaa	what a fantastic question you are asking.      i learned a few things myself while searching your answer.  unfortunately i did not come up with any hard and fast rules about  warm versus cold trypsin treatments.      i suspect the best answer is to "know thy cell".  the more you know about the cell line you are working with the better.        this is a terrific resource about cells: http://www.atcc.org      here are some helpful notes about trypsination:  http://www.tissue-cell-culture.com/docs/...    Trypsinization: The misuse of trypsin can lead to immediate and long-term problems with a set of cultures. Trypsin is a popular detachment factor because it digests the proteins that keep the cell attached to a surface. Prolonged exposure to trypsin can result in too much of the cell being digested, which can cause cell damage or destruction. A few keys to correctly using trypsin:        * Use the correct concentration for the cultures being used. Some cells are easy to detach and others are much more difficult to dissociate from the substrate. Different concentrations of trypsin are available with or without EDTA. EDTA, also called Versene, increases a trypsin solution's effect by taking up calcium and magnesium ions.        * Watch the clock. Only leave the trypsin on the cultures as long as is absolutely necessary. Check the monolayer often to see if it is beginning to come off and at that point, a gentle tap against the side of the vessel may help to dislodge the cells. Be aware that forcing cells to detach by harsh mechanical treatment such as smacking the flask can cause the cells to "tear" off the surface and cause permanent damage.        * Neutralize the trypsin after the cells have detached by adding serum or gently centrifuging the cells into a pellet and re-suspending in fresh media. Because serum contains trypsin inhibitors, it is important to completely remove serum prior to trypsinization. This can be done by first rinsing the monolayer with serum-free medium or a calcium- and magnesium-free balanced salt solution such as DPBS.        * Control the trypsin by controlling the temperature. Cells that are sensitive to trypsin should be trypsinized at room temperature or refrigerated temperatures, while trypsinizing in a 37 C incubator can speed up the process for more stubborn cells and reduce the total exposure time.    for a more detailed perspective, this paper looks interesting and might solve some very complex trypsin questions:  http://www.febsletters.org/article/S0014...       i send you best karma,    dumbdumb

8Y7LQ6TGaa	Really not practical. You would be winding it up every 10 seconds, and still getting only a few watts out of it. Your hand turning a crank can put out only a small amount of power, 20 watts at the most. Then you get the losses from the spring/gear mechanisms and the generator, probably 50% at best. Better to skip the mechanical spring mechanism, and just run a generator directly from a crank.  But even there you lose a lot, and your arm just can't put out much power.    Then you bring up a battery to power the crank. Talk about Rube Goldberg contraptions. The efficiency goes from 50% to 20%! Battery runs motor turns crank turns gears winds spring. Spring turns gears turns flywheel turns generator charges battery runs inverter outputs 120 VAC !!  And the battery last 5 minutes, then you have to put in a new one. All for a few watts out, enough for one dim light bulb.    More likely is an exercise bike powered source, your legs can put out more continuous power than an arm can. Forget the mechanical windup mechanism, it just loses power. But even someone in good shape on a well designed efficient bike/generator can put out a few hundred watts for maybe a few hours.    But a house needs at least 1000 watts. So visualize 5 bikes with 5 atheletes pedaling hard, with 10 more standing by for their shift, just to power one house?     .|`|qaMPEdL2aa	It's called a portable generator.  It runs on gasoline (petrol) or diesel fuel.    Fridge size generators are available that would run on natural gas so that you would not need to mess with liquid fuels.  They are equipped with transfer switches that would disconnect the house from the mains and and power the vital loads. They start automatically on loss of power.  They are expensive.    Alternatively you could use a fridge-sized collection of automobile batteries with a static inverter to make AC.

MLN2tJuyaa	DNA is negatively charged and the salt solution is added to neutralize the charge (actually it is neutralized by the monovalent cation in the salt; sodium, ammonium or potassium ion for example). This allows the the DNA to become closely associated, as happens when precipitated, without the negative charge causing repulsion of the DNA molecules.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	I don't know, I'm not familiar with that procedure.

Use it at the center of a "pivot" point, kind of like a bearing, ensuring there's no side to side motion, and it would be kind of like a stacked series of slip rings. You can certainly get ones which have 4 independent lines(rather than the normal 3). That would allow 2 lines for power, and 2 lines for data.

The slip rings could be arranged in concentric circles on a flat plane or arranged in rows up a cylinder.
AA11261367	There is something wrong when you refer to the movement of a particle of the string. The particle will only move around its equilibrium position as the wave travels along the string. This is an oscillating motion.  It you are talking about the time for the wave to travel 1 km, that is very easy:    t = x / v = 1000 / 450|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Since you have the frequency you know that the particle of string will move up and down from the neutral position by a total of 8 mm per cycle.    1 km = 1,000,000 mm so it will take 1,000,000 / 8 cycles of oscillation.    the time for one cycle is 1/2500 so the time for 1 km is     (1,000,000 / 8)*(1 / 2500) = 50 s
DrwY7dJCaa	1) Presence of certain compounds/ environmental factors trigger a gene to be turned on, ie. by making inhibitors unbind...  2) The required gene is unwound in the DNA in the nucleus of the cell and is copied to form mRNA.   3) The mRNA is able to pass out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm.  4) In the cytoplasm, ribosome(s) attach to the mRNA, and attach amino acids together via peptide bonds. This is done by the anti-codon on the tRNA having a base triplet complementary to the codon on the mRNA.  5) Eventually a stop codon is reached, and a polypeptide chain is made. This can be altered and packaged at the rough ER and golgi apparatus to form proteins.

It apparently has to do with the way humans evolved into  living  in very complex hierarchical societies.  and that societies interplay with all the brains involved.

AA11549521	for the first two questions we will use the uniform acceleration formula:    X = X0 + V0*t + (a*t^2) / 2    let's define the top of the plain as X0 = 0. the far end of the slope will be X = 16 m. the first block is released from rest so V0 = 0 too. when we put in the equation the values X = 16m, t= 4.2 s we can solve for a:    a = (2*X) / t^2 = 32 m/ 17.64 sec^2 = 1.81 m / sec^2    to find the initial speed of block no. 2 we'll use the fact that at time t = 4.2 sec it returns to it's initial position X = X0 so they cancel each other out of the equation. this time let's solve the equation for V0:    V0 = (a*t) / 2 = (1.81 * 4.2) / 2 = 3.81 m/sec    (this time either V0 or a needs to be negative in the equation because the initial speed of the second block is up the plain while it's acceleration is down the plain)    for the third and final question we will use another formula:    V^2 = V0^2 - 2*a*(X-X0)    where V is the speed at position X. in our case the final speed is 0 (the body comes to rest at it's highest point and then start rolling back down). Vo and a are known and X0 = 0 so we just need to solve for X:    X = v0^2 / (2*a) = 4.01 m
7f8FtSw2aa	Astronomers call telescopes "light buckets" and for good reason. The larger the better (and girth is more important than length). Bigger telescopes can see finer detail and they collect more light, so they can see fainter objects.    With larger, and more expensive, telescopes can see more stuff but there's still one problem. The human eye can only take in so much light - even if looking through a large telescope. Really faint objects can only be captured by cameras hooked up to telescopes.    With the naked eye (in an area where there is little light and atmospheric pollution and your eyes have dark adapted) you can see stars up to magnitude 6.5m    Small binoculars go out to the 9th magnitude, larger ones to the 10th magnitude. A small (3in diameter) telescope 11th magnitude, and a 6in telescope which is average for amateurs goes out to 13th magnitude.    However what you see though your telescope are not going to be the full colour images on google earth. When looking at faint objects the human eye sees in black and white, so only really bright objects have colour that we can see. The images on google are produced by photographs through special colour filters which are recombined into what you see there.|`|GAel6aReaa	I don't know, I'm not much of a scope user, but I do think google earth space is kinda cool, but really sucks to for astronomers.     try http://www.stellarium.org/ instead  its free and it rocks.  just make sure you pick the right location and set your time before checking out the sky    you can even change the appertain magnitude manually

wJTsifugaa	This is an unusual detergent mix, if it will act as a detergent.  The aluminum sulfate will form aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3 by taking OH- out of the water, leaving behind the H+ acid ion.

Hang time only depends on motion in the y-direction:    y = 0, assuming cannonball falls back down to same level  a = -g  vi = vsin    y = vi(t) + ?a(t)2  0 = v(sin)(t) + ?(-g)(t)2  0 = t(vsin - ?gt)    Clearly, there are two points in time when the projectile is at ground level.  t = 0, is the time when the projectile is launched.  let 0 = vsin - ?gt to find out when it lands    ?gt = vsin  t = 2vsin/g    This result can also be obtained by showing that the initial vertical speed is equal to the final vertical speed but opposite in direction:  vf2 = vi2 + 2gy  since change in height is 0,  vf2 = vi2  vf = -vi, since the projectile moves up on the way up and down on the way down    Using: a = (vf - vi)/t  t = (vf - vi)/a  t = (-vi - vi)/a  t = -2vi/a  t = -2vsin/-g  t = 2vsin/g    2) Determine Range    To determine range, analyse motion in the horizontal or x-direction:  x = vt, where v is the constant horizontal speed of the projectile    x = (vcos)(2vsin/g)  x = 2v2cossin/g      [Maximum Height]    To determine the max height, analyse motion in the vertical direction:  y = (vf2 - vi2)/(2a)  vf = 0, else ball can continue moving higher  vi = vsin  a = -g    y = (0 - (vsin)2/(-2g)  y = (vsin)2/(2g)      [Max Height vs Range]    x = 3y  [2v2cossin/g] = 3[(vsin)2/(2g)]    multiply both sides by 2g/[3(v2sin)] to get:  (4/3)cos = sin  4/3 = tan   = arctan(4/3)   = 53.1

ifwgd5dMaa	"Living fossils" as defined here has important implications for evolutionary theory.  Taxa of organisms that show little change over millions of years are important evidence in the argument over tempo and mode of evolution.    Stephen J Gould's theory of Punctuated Equilibrium states that species diverge over a short period of time and then remain largely unchanged as long as their habitat stays the same.  A species adapts quickly to a niche and as long as that niche exists, the adapted species will most likely be better adapted than any neighboring or encroaching other species.    If sharks had evolved 500 million years ago (or whenever), and changed continuously since that time, they would no longer be recognizable to us as sharks or as direct ancestors of modern sharks.

It actually dissociates in water like this    NaHCO3  ---> Na+   +   HCO3-  or  sodium bicarbonate  --> sodium ion insolution + bicarbonate ion in solution    Now this is fairly stable and remain pretty much as is unless acid or base is added but that was not suggested in your question.|`|yxBeaoJxaa	You get minor amounts of NaOH, sodium hydroxide. The baking soda will also be an electrolyte in the water.

IIGvtAT2aa	let x be the number of grams of the 40%-peanut nut mixture    then    20*0.25 = x*0.4 + (20-x)*0.1    thus  x = 10 lbs    and the other mixture would also be 10 lbs|`|0UpFkX5oaa	ok, say mix1 (x) is the 40%, and mix2 (y) is the 10%. Now, the final mixture you need has to be 20lb, so whatever proportion of mixes you use, it will have to add up to 20. From there comes the first equation:    x + y = 20    The second one is a little trickier. You know the proportion and the final weight of the final mix, therefore you know exactly the weight in peanuts you need in the end. It's 25% of 20lbs. That amount of peanuts will have to come from the sum of all the peanuts on both mixes, therefore:    peanuts in mix1 + peanuts in mix2 = 0.25 * 20    Following the peanut proportion in the mixes:    0.40x + 0.10 y = 0.25 * 20    Now the equations you need to solve are:    x + y = 20       ((1))  0.40x + 0.10 y = 0.25 * 20     ((2))    Solution to the equation system:    Solving for y in ((1))    y = 20 - x      ((3))    Subs. ((3)) in ((2))    0.40x + 0.10 (20 - x) = 0.25 * 20  0.40x + 2 - 0.10x = 5  0.30x = 5 - 2  0.30x = 3  x = 3/0.30 = 10      Subs. x in ((3))    y = 20 - 10 = 10     Answer in words: 10 pounds of each should be mixed to achieve the desired proportion.    good luck! :)|`|k2yO7tPLaa	Let amount of 40% mixture in lb = a  Let amount of 10% mixture in lb = b    Then,    a + b = 20  (i.e. total amount in final mix in pounds is equal to sum of the amount of mixture a used and the amount of mixture b used)    and,    0.4a + 0.1b = 0.25 x 20  (i.e.amount of peanuts in first mixture plus amount of peanuts in second mixture is equal to the amount of peanuts in final mixture)    We have two simultaneous equations:    0.4a + 0.1b = 5  a + b = 20    Multiply the first equation by 10:    4a + b = 50  a + b = 20    Subtract the second equation from the first:    3a + 0b = 30  3a = 30  a = 10    Therefore 10lb of the 40% mixture required.    Substitute a = 10 into the second equation:    10 + b = 20  b = 20 - 10  b = 10    Therefore 10lb of the 10% mixture required.

vErVG8Csaa	302 with Sutcliffe eh?    First of all Dr. A is almost correct, but not quite. First thing that should have tipped him off was that he got a basic solution after adding equal amounts of strong acid and weak base.     Also, I think you mean 1250 mg of hilariamine, or at least that's what I have.    So bottom line is you will put equal amounts of both in the solution, they will react in a 1:1 ration making a salt, BHCl    We know that this will dissociate as follows    BHCl ---> BH + Cl, where the Cl will do nothing  and notice that [BH] = [BHCl] which is just   (.125/115.6/.175) = .006179    However the BH will dissociate    BH +H2O ---> B + H3O    The K for this equation is [B][H3O]/[BH]  and this looks alot like a Ka, not a Kb which we are given    So do Ka = Kw/Kb = 3.448276e-11    Then use quadratic or an approximation to find [H3O]  3.448276e-11 = x^2 / (.006179 - x)  x = 4.615756e-7    The pH is  just -log[H3O] = -log(4.615756e-7) = 6.3    This is basically what Dr. A said, but he got it backwards.  Also, make sure that its 125mg and not 1250mg that will affect the answer too. For me my answer was 5.9, but I also had a different MW.|`|Y4YuOenwaa	moles = 0.125 g / 115.6 g/mol= 0.00108  0.00108/ 0.175 L= 0.00618 M = concentration salt  Ka = Kw/Kb = 3.4 x 10^-11 = x^2 / 0.00618-x  x = [OH-]= 4.6 x 10^-7 M  pOH = 6.3  pH = 7.7
w5KHZRiqaa	In my opinion, not off of any sites, I think that if someone is participating in a non-aerobic sport such as hockey then caffeine is a good drink. This is because you are taking short shifts of giving it your all, and the game isn't that long, still water hours before the game is good, but caffeine gives that good rush. For an aerobic sport, such as soccer, you are not giving it you ALL every second, so water would be the best drink, because it helps you last longer.|`|1c4sIg9Laa	caffeine dehydrates you while water doesn't.|`|4G90GebAaa	Your cells need water to keep functioning and perform mitosis.
