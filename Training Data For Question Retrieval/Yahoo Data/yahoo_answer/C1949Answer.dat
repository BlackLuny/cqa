eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	There are 3 ways. You know about the USB adapter, and yes there is a LAN adapter. It's not an everyday cord you can get, but it's a special adapter that Nintendo made (moneymoneymoney) so you don't have to use WiFi. I'm pretty sure you'll have to order it online, but check walmart and target too.

73t6LfrDaa	What you are wanting to do can be done, however, it isn't going to be easy. You're laptop is going to need to have a wireless networking card so you can create an ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) network with your PS3. You are also going to need to either setup internet connection sharing (ICS) with windows, or you will need to find another way to link your two network connections together on your PC (one being your wireless card in ad-hoc mode with your PS3, the other being your broadband card from TMobile)|`|QoWi0hzWaa	umm mybe one of the usb modem ones but im not sure|`|VFTn5MVtaa	Try going to a Tmobile store and ask for a little information about the data usage allowed per month on one of those wireless internet cards or USB.  I'm sure that most, if not all, allow a maximum of 5GB of data transfer per month and would charge extra for each kb of additional data sent and received.  Just to give you an idea of how much data your game would require, look at the size of a normal digital picture that you send through e-mail, then add the additional data used to send it and to receive confirmation on your computer.  Having said that you can imagine the amount of data required to be able to play online with the data intensive games that are out on the market today.  If you add it all, you could end up with a bill for 100's of dollars if not thousands!  What I didn't mention is that you also need to have software installed for it to work, and so it would not be compatible with your PS3.  Some companies will also disconnect your service when you reach their maximum data allowance.  If I were you I would try replacing your current dial-up service for cable DSL or Broadband, they are available nowadays through the major cable service providers or through your satellite service provider.  Good luck!

3b5AOCZFaa	Theres really no point for me to answer this but like both  people above me already said, you have the Red Ring of Death. It's a 360's worst nightmare, and it's pretty bad you got it after 2 days. However i noticed you said it works with other games, then it might be the game for some reason. Unplug everything from the back, and take the harddrive out. Now plug everything back in firmly and put the harddrive back in. Try it now. If it doesn't work, then your L4D has something wrong with it. It can't be the Xbox if it works with other games. But if it starts to not work with the other games too, then just bring it back and exchange it.|`|zmyZ9BgZaa	Just like Jonathan said, it's the Red Ring of Death. They actually were supposed to put new parts in it to prevent these from happening as much, and seeing as you got it 2 days ago, it should have the chip installed. It may be from overheating, or that is the usual problem. Also, sit your Xbox horizontally (if not already), it helps keep the disc still and readable at all times due to gravity. But for the Red Ring, send it into Xbox, it's not fun, but if you get the box back working, it's obviously worth it. About 3-4 weks wait though. :||`|BelXoujYaa	You have the " Red Ring of Death". It's when the Xbox 360 fails. Don't worry, a lot of people have it. Since yours is new (you have the 1-year warranty, just return it and they will give you a new one (or they will fix it for you)|`|6qPFNkyDaa	RROD (Red Ring Of Death)<br>  If you just got it, take it back because that isn't supost to happen when it's brand new.

3b5AOCZFaa	Well, i had somewhat of the same problem. I have about 30 PS2 games and i was saving up for a PS3 so all that money wasnt wasted, but a friend sold me his 360 for pretty cheap. I wasnt sure at first, but i thought i'd give it a try. Trust me, i dont think you'll be dissapointed. The Xbox 360 is well worth its money. The games for it, and the online gaming, its just all incredible. It can be addicting at times, and if you get addicted to video games easy you probably will get addicted to this, but i would get it anyway. It will change gaming as you know if forever. Not only is it good for gaming though, you can watch DVDs through it, and since you have money for a live card, if you have Netflix you can watch unlimited movies and TV shows from it. Besides, as i did, you can keep your PS2 and play it when you want a change. But overall, i think getting a 360 is a good idea.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you are getting two games, i would highly recommend: <br>  <br>  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare or World at War<br>  and<br>  Fallout 3|`|c1BdzCayaa	dude the same thing happend to me and i got halo 3,prince of persia,halo 2,and bully scholeship ed.i for one am so happy i did it,it is amazing i can talk to my friends and family its awsome<br>  <br>                  BUYYYYY ITTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|GptXZXg7aa	if u have the money and u liked playing on it then u should buy it but also have some money to reserve for the games|`|G6eUPxQlaa	BUY IT!

RyvKws7Laa	1080i = interlaced, which means that every time the image on the screen is drawn only 1/2 of the horizontal lines are drawn (a field).  2 fields comprise a frame.  So in this case you get 59.94 fields per second or 29.97 frames per second.  This requires way less bandwidth for the broadcast TV companies.  And because of the nature of the human eye we can see the fields merged as a single image.<br>  <br>  1080p = progressive, which means each time the image is drawn on the screen the entire screen is drawn.  So you get 59.94 frames per second.  This requires a lot more bandwidth for broadcaster so hasn't been well adopted on that front.  But it makes little difference for BluRay authoring, so some BluRay discs are appearing in this format.<br>  <br>  At the screen sizes you're talking about, you want 1080p.  You can notice the advantages of 1080p viewing at that large a size.  Now you will only get to view it sometimes (when you get something sending out 1080p), but at least then your set is ready to go for those instances.<br>  <br>  As for brands, Samsung is the leader in LCDs, hands down.  Sony/Panasonic/Sharp Aquos also have very strong sets.  Whatever brand you go with though you need to look at the specific model you're interested in.  Not all models of a single brand are made equal.<br>  <br>  Also, at that size, with LCD, look for 120Hz refresh rate.  For fast motion on LCDs  you can get motion blur problems (a ghosting, a ghost trail follows the fast moving object).  60Hz sets just can't refresh the image quickly enough.  120Hz helps this issue quite a bit (but is still not as good as Plasma which is near instantaneous).  <br>  <br>  I would recommend though, the Samsung LN52A650 as the best image quality bang-for-buck in the sizes you're looking at.  Again, lots of other options out there though, and you need to research each model on its own merits.  That's just one I think is really strong at that size and well priced (considering the size and quality).|`|HX6JjCTyaa	For 50 to 55 inch screen you should go with 1080p<br>  I would suggest Samsung or Sony brand.Great quality picture with good quality.<br>  For Samsung I would suggest Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color or if you want 55 inch Samsung LN55A950 55" 1080p LCD HDTV with 120Hz refresh rate and LED backlighting is the best choice.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D979929011%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fp%255F4%255F0%26bbn%3D979929011%26qid%3D1235209084%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A1065836%252Cn%253A172659%252Cn%253A979929011%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fthree%255Fbrowse-bin%253A724227011%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fbrowse-bin%253A550061011%252Cp%255Fn%255Fsize%255Fbrowse-bin%253A1232883011%252Cp%255F4%253ASamsung&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a><br>  <br>  and here are some good model for Sony <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D979929011%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fp%255F4%255F1%26bbn%3D979929011%26qid%3D1235209207%26rnid%3D15784691%26rh%3Dn%253A1065836%252Cn%253A172659%252Cn%253A979929011%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fthree%255Fbrowse-bin%253A724227011%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fbrowse-bin%253A550061011%252Cp%255Fn%255Fsize%255Fbrowse-bin%253A1232883011%252Cp%255F4%253ASony&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|ZG6DeAzPaa	I actually agree with everything jf says, and don't have much to add.

DEkQe6Zpaa	If you have the backlight set to stay on 'forever' then you'll find that makes HUGE difference.  Make sure to change it to like 10 seconds...<br>  <br>  Also, make sure to charge your ipod even after a little use.  Then, like once a month, let it go almost completely out and then charge it.  That's the most efficient way.  <br>  <br>  When you're not using it, make sure to turn it off AND put it on hold, so it doesn't turn on by mistake.  <br>  <br>  Also, when charging, you can have it be off so not to waste battery.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

441GSyaMaa	For all the idiots who say that the army don't use Xbox controllers, I know exactly what you're talking about, for the little spy planes they use to fly over certain areas so they can see what's there before endangering lives. <br>  <br>  I guess the response on the the analogue sticks is really good and can be controlled easier? and unlike a normal remote control, say for a car, you'll have all the different buttons so I guess it gives it more options in terms of use, different things you can do...<br>  <br>  I reckon it would be kinda fun to use :-P|`|sLEoWYr5aa	I think it's to do with hand-to-eye coordination, playing video games trains you very well for e.g. multitasking in the cockpit of a plane.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	I think you are referring to them being used to control UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). The fact is that they are simply well suited to that particular application. If there is already something on the market that will do the job,why bother designing and making something yourself?|`|oIcdt0FXaa	Because microsoft paid them thousands to put the british army "playing" with an xbox for advertising.<br>  <br>  its just for the advert they don't really use them.

eQJEybW6aa	Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360<br>  <br>  The *expected* lifetimes of current home video game consoles:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.<br>  <br>  In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future and it has over-the-top graphical capabilities (google “Heavy Rain”). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:<br>  <br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet<br>  -Free online service<br>  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time, 128 VS 128)<br>  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser<br>  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive<br>  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)<br>  <br>  With the Xbox 360, you get:<br>  -DVD Player/upconverter<br>  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it<br>  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (that’s a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)<br>  -Umm…can’t really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories. 120GB for $150? With the PS3, you can upgrade to 500GB for $110!<br>  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")<br>  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 12th!<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console $400<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do<br>  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)<br>  Xbox Live $60<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $640<br>  <br>  That’s not cheaper, so get a grip on it! The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look the same, if not better on the PS3. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  Xbox Live VS PSN? The only thing you are missing is cross voice chat, which can easily be solved by using a telephone, or even in PSN’s V3.00 update, which we will be seeing soon enough.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has sold 21 million units in 2 years. The Xbox 360 has sold 28 million in 3 years. Plus a 33% failure rate, that means that 9.24 million units are either refurbished ones or replacements. So really, the amount of one-time buyers is about 19 million. So really, the PS3 has sold 21 million in 2 years, while the Xbox 360 has sold 19 in 3 years, and the PS3 has a higher face value ($199.99 vs. $399.99)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the PS3 is better—you get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer—legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Nz2rMeFBaa	360 is way cheaper and pretty much  as good graphics with cheaper games then a ps3 plus hold more memory. the only advantage is ps3 has blue ray|`|6GIrW5eWaa	wasn't aware that there were such games called playstation 3 or xbox 360. I believe these are consoles, but I will have to check my source and get back to you.<br>  <br>  People take themselves and the internet just way to serious anyway you have come to the Xbox area and you will have many different "opinions" on which console is better. The fact of the matter is they are both good systems. What can you afford? What are you looking for from a system. PS3 certainly has the added benefit of also being a blue ray player. Which has more selection of games and geared toward online play the Xbox. The game video is equal and most of the time is not gated by the console but more so the games that they are developed in. Hopefully you will forgive the correction at first, yes I was having a little fun. Good luck on your search for the better system and if you want opinions you certainly came to the right place. :)<br>  <br>  Did I mention that everyone would have an opinion? Yeah like the wall of text blah blah blah below informative? Certainly. Correct not so certain but an opinion was asked and his was provided no matter how wrong it is :)
54y0GDJqaa	Heres what I did instead of sending it off.Get a Xbox 360 core system power cord.If you compare it to the arcade power cord it has more volts.Which meens more powers.Which meens more power on the fans.It has worked for me.I got RROD the first day.Used my old power cord.Workin for 5 months.|`|bTvYXwaWaa	its because its old|`|8UfL6Yenaa	I had the same problem with my 360. I eventually got the RROD.|`|AA11131134	Looks like you are heading towards the RROD.  Just play as much as possible and when you get the red ring of death, call up MS and get it sent in for repair.
2R1VLXePaa	Wait till one of the missiles the dragon fires gets close to you, freeze time, PK the missile and aim it at him and throw it back at him. This will knock him out, then you shoot him with your Disintigrator Ray and that will wake him up. Then you just repeat that a few times, and that's it!

TaxYLHbMaa	that's a hard one , I would suggest bullet cams but they need a bit of infrastructure. the last ones I sold for this type of thing were SVP t-400 , they are the size of a packet of ciggies , and around $130 or less in price  , they have all you need , and you can close the viewfinder and keep it closed while recording , you can hide these in all kinds of things , they record for around 5-6 hours straight , and quality settings range from vga to 1080p high def this is what you are looking for , there is a tiny led light that you will have to cover with bluetac , these dont make a sound , and are sdhc camera's which have no moving parts

9sRUf4zEaa	Tectonically the signal is pretty good, for my internet connection, it's the a bit above the minimum to play online without a hitch (but overall it depends on your provider). If you want to improve it you can try to move the ps3 closer to the router or use a cat5 cable and connect the ps3 directly to the router. You can even try using a wireless router signal booster.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	It's already okay. You can face your router / router antennas towards the direction of you PS3, or get a Wireless N router and get an even better signal.|`|xMk8muECaa	you can get a bigger range for your router or just bring it closer to the ps3 mines is like 62% as  well not great but i get good online play neways add me on raidenpatel if u wona play some time|`|1aqrRzqLaa	Its better than 50%. I wouldn't worry about your signal strength if it isn't at 100%. But as long as you are having decent online gaming with minor glitches and lag.
EePcxbRyaa	i would say the sony but many people would probably disagree cause everyone thinks skullcandy headphones are "AMAZING".. or everyone that i have talked to.. but i dont think they are that great   it might be different for me cause i have bose but i think they are like a cheap version of bose and they dont sound good but  on the other hand ihave never listened to music on the sony headphones, but im assuming that they would be better than the skullcandy buds because they cover the whole ear, and your choice also depends on if you want big bulky headphones or small ear buds.. these skullcandy earbuds do look different than the ones at target or something but they look nicer.. but i would go with the sony ones just because i have listened to skullcandy and i wasnt impressed.. if you wanted something else for about the same price, i would say get the bose ones they are only about $5 more than the sony ones AND the bose comes with a one year warranty so if anything happens to them within a year, then you can replace them.. i was constantly putting them in my pockets and throwing them around like on my bed and stuff and the wires started to break so i contacted bose and i sent them in and within a couple days i had a brand new pair of the same headphones.. so i would say the bose ones.. but if youre set on one of the ones you said, then i would say sony.. hope i helped|`|AA10323989	the sony MDR are better for yuor ears but the earbuds are smaller and more easy to carry around it just depends on what u r comfortbale with and what ones u think are better|`|47I8LVjXaa	The top ones are the best in my opinion because they are comfortable and sound good the bottom ones hurt my ears|`|8YrdmFWHaa	number 2.

AA11131134	It sounds like the movie saved as individual files instead of one complete file.  You might need to pick up a program for your computer, if you don't already have one, that is a movie maker type program.  That way you could splice all the pieces together and watch the movie straight through.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Well that's what's with my ps2 too. To be honest I don't think that they could play a burned dvd very well. Don't believe me? Ask around yourself and make sure you know who you ask incase they lie!|`|Xxviy63Paa	did you try pressing play all instead? Next would just show you the next page of the menu.<br>  <br>  nero is a fancy piece of garbage, that's for sure... by default it will make your dvd with a nice menu with all the different parts previewed, but it won't just burn the thing to disc.<br>  <br>  Is the movie in .iso form? And is it under 4.4gb in size? If so, forget Nero, just burn it directly to disc. make sure to "burn from image" instead of burning it directly to disc, or you'll end up with a data disc with an .iso file on it.<br>  <br>  That's the whole point of using .iso files, is they are disc images, kind of like photo negatives, all you have to do is splap them back onto a disc and you have a copy of the original disc. No need to use authoring software - unless it is still a full size dvd.<br>  <br>  If you can't figure it out, do this: download DVDShrink 3.2. It's free. Then un-iso the movie if you need to, and open it with dvdshrink, and it will shrink it down to 4.4 gb and put it in .iso form ready to burn to disc. There's a box you can check to have it burn the shrunk movie to disc using Nero, too, which you already have, so it would work. And you can use it to re-author the disc, too... say you want to get rid of the french soundtrack, and the subtitles, and the director's commentary, etc.|`|aV5bO41faa	Here is a step by step guide to burn DVD from any video formats.

AbRfd29Haa	Well, realistically, more "MP3" players today are really "personal media players"... they already do more than just play music. Most play videos of some sort, a few offer games, radio, etc. <br>  <br>  I think Apple classifies it as an iPod... they don't necessarily even want to lump it into other categories, becuse they're very successful with it, and they're doing fine without that. <br>  <br>  In fact, it's a bit of a mix of things... it's potentially a personal media player, an internet tablet (see Nokia's N810 for another such device), a PDA, etc.<br>  <br>  You might call it a pocket computer, sure. Like any personal computer, it can run a variety of applications. One thing that makes it distince from many other PDAs is the notion of an API  -- an Application Programmer's Interface. All personal computer or PDA operating systems have these; that's the set of rules that lets a programming write a program (an App, in Apple parlance) that's certain to work on all of today's models, but tomorrows as well if all goes right. <br>  <br>  So, if you really did want to lump it into a category, it's more like the Palm or WinCE PDAs than anything else -- runs a variety of applications, hits the internet, plays music and video (I used to keep 16GB of music and video on my Palm Treo), etc. <br>  <br>  I think Apple may also be shying away from that designation. For one, it's actually Apple who coined the term PDA = Personal Digital Assistant. That was their name for a thing called the Newton, many years back. They had some early success with it, but ultimately lost out to Palm, who proved that PDAs work better with simple applications. So look at Apple today... Apps are super cheap, they do just one thing usually, and they have kind of out-Palmed the original Palm idea, by making the PDA so simple you don't think it's a PDA. <br>  <br>  But anyway, that's the lump I'd put it in, based on tradition. Apple's just going to call it an iPod... they'll claim they defy any other categorization.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	How about "personal entertainment platform". It is more than a music/video player, but is not quite a handheld computing platform.

3b5AOCZFaa	It's actually a total waste of time. It's used by the same fags that use a lag switch, who feel they must cheat to win. Anyways, it makes a pistol (not just in the COD series but in most games) goes as fast as an automatic. In COD4 for example, a Deagle would go as fast as a P90. It's an extra button usually on the back that just acts as the trigger button. Look it up on youtube to see more.|`|6DJLblHbaa	it can turn a pistol into a automatic|`|54y0GDJqaa	I know about these because my friend has one.You can make one on your own but its usually a crap one.There used for like on COD WAW you can make something thats a single shot an automatic by turning the Dual on and holding the right trigger.Or in some cases just holding down a button.It comes in handy.They will also tell you what games there for and there not cheap.Like 120$.So hope i helped.|`|l27zURMnaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yctMHb1Ra0w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yctMHb1Ra...</a><br>  that is what its for

Then, they will transfer your number onto the new simcard and phone and Viola! It'll work perfectly and you'll have a new phone! =]<br>  <br>  Its a really easy process and I know it sounds kinda hard, if you have any questions, email me, I'll be happy to help!<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, for real, only buy the T-Mobile To Go Phone from like Target, Walmart, Best Buy, or T-Mobile.com because if you go into the store, they'll charge you big bucks!<br>  <br>  I can help you find a phone and everything if you want, just email me!<br>  <br>  Its no use paying for a phone you don't even have!<br>  <br>  Haha good luck and again, email me for help!<br>  <br>  Jayy
Ngjpf1uJaa	I do honestly prefer qwerty keyboards over touch screens. but i honestly think the blade is just like 2008 but it's more rounded. I suggest the instinct because you'll still be able to text and have a fully keyboard(hopefully), internet,and mostly everything you listed. Plus since you have sprint you'll probably have a discount.
cn0ALwwLaa	Going to the old-school way of hooking up a game. Alrighty then.<br>  <br>  Most often, through the cable hookup, it is Channel 3. I have also seen it as Channel 4, during the old days of 'Hook it up to the VCR.' Just waaay less common, though I have seen it work.<br>  <br>  RCA inputs will be Video 1 and usually a Video 3 on the back on a high-end set like my Sony Trinitron. Video 2 is in the front. May be easier for you.<br>  <br>  The TV will have an Input select, as well as the Channels Up and Down Button. If trying to play it through Channel 3 or 4 with the coax (normal black cable) cable, out it on Channel 3 or 4. Channel 3 should be snowy until the game turns on. Bingo, the game system sent a signal to the TV set.<br>  <br>  If trying for RCA inputs (the red, white, and yellow ones that are color-coded,) switch the INPUTS to match Video 1, 2, or 3 with the Input button, or remote. <br>  <br>  That should do it.|`|UinOWcMUaa	You hit input select, until you get to the source in which you hooked up your game consul too :)<br>  <br>  For ex: if you connected your 360 to video 1 it would thus be video 1 :)|`|w1QuVAX2aa	Channel 3 or TV video? Maybe hit source on your tv remote if you have it.|`|AEHk87hmaa	maybe channel 3?

Kinda odd.|`|2JGSrYJ5aa	Do what the others say but bulb also means as long as you keep your finger on the shutter release the shutter stays open. If you get a remote you can keep the shutter open for a very long time especially good for night shots, and light streaks.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	You need to put the camera in manual and turn the dial until you see a B.

y1D0N34Saa	your question is a little confusing let me try and sort this out...<br>  <br>  If by broadband enabled you mean you have a wireless connection and you want to connect the xbox to it? You already have a router making a wireless signal you would need to buy a wireless adapter (50$) to make your xbox able to connect to your network.<br>  <br>  If by broadband enabled you mean you have broadband internet (dsl or cable) and you want to connect the xbox to it? You can connect the xbox right to the router with a ethernet chord you would just have to take out the internet one that is for your comp, the ideal way to do it would be buy a router hook it up to your modem then hook your xbox to your router with a ethernet cable.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps your question is a little confusing.

It will last a lot longer then the others. However, I would look into Fallout 3. It has an incredible story and it's really addicting.

That means don't crack it open and use your MacGyver skills on it to fix it yourself.

zmyZ9BgZaa	They have no policy for fixing controllers. But maybe if it's something minor, you could maybe fix it yourself, worth a shot.<br>  <br>  (Torx T8 screwdriver needed to open the controller)|`|SBcxooLsaa	buy new one it sucks|`|4AQPx75qaa	If it's your fault that it's broken (aka...got really mad, slammed controller on floor) then no.  If it's old, also no.  If it's a new controller and it just randomly broke (not related to misuse/anger) you could contact Microsoft and ask them.<br>  <br>  If it's simple, you can open it up with a T8, though the screws have an annoying "pin" that keeps a normal T8 out, so either somehow break the pin, get a T8 that has a hole in the middle, or jam a small flat head screwdriver in and twist that way.

874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	Yes, but you'll have to find out if any of them are iTunes Plus songs.  These don't have the restrictions that the old itunes songs had.  If you have songs that are not iTunes Plus, then what you'll have to do is burn them onto a cd, then open the cd with Windows Media player and rip them for her player with that program.

SKkE3fK1aa	Actually, people messed up the minds of others by naming the 3rd Generation iPod into iPod 3G, much like 1st-gen to 1G and also like iPod Touch to iTouch.<br>  <br>  Network Connection:<br>  3G means 'Third Generation' but THAT is different from the 3G in the iPod. The 3G in phones means a faster connection to a network. You will only see the word '3G' on a phone not on the iPod. The iPod's Third Generation will be abbribiated as '3rd-Gen or Thrid-Gen' but there are people out there still calling them 3G. 3G on phones also lets you VIDEO CALL, and have a FASTER WEB BROWSING on your phone.<br>  <br>  iPod:<br>  The iPod calls it '3rd-Gen or Third-Gen' not 3G. Only the random consumers call it '3G'. The '3G' on the iPod means 'a new release'.|`|66dAMlktaa	you got it, 3G is the third generation of tele standards, for video calls, broadband connection, etc...|`|AA10356082	It's the same thing, the 3G data network that both Verizon and Apple have in their phones. <br>  <br>  It's kinda confusing since you would think that the iPhone3G stands for the 3rd version of the phone, but it's just the data network that the iPhone uses.

1HtTxOOQaa	Sorry, God Of War 3 will only feature on the PS3 and there is absolutely no way the thing can feature on the PS2 or PSP. The developers during the recent unveiling of the trailer showed that Kratos model was created using just 4000 polygons (more Polygons means more detailing) in the PS2 version, whereas Kratos 3.0 (that is what they nick named it him for the third installment) will be made of 20000 polygons!!!! It will probably be even better looking than any game, even Killzone 2 (and by the way, Killzone 2 is the best looking game on a console till date better than Gears of War 2 and MGS4). Also, the game will be is FULL HD and will use dual layer Blu-Ray discs. The developers have quoted 'Kratos can't be even loaded on the PS2 forget about the level and action.'<br>  <br>  A PSP version is also not possible. You can expect a Chains of Olympus like version of a new GOW, but that also is very unlikely.<br>  <br>  God Of War is a console selling game. The game has a fan base that stands shoulder to shoulder with the MGS or Final Fantasy fan base. I actually bought a PS3 solely to play this game. Everything else is bonus (and what a bonus it is to have Killzone 2!!!). The new GOW3 trailer made my hair stand up.

PNxk3aR6aa	I'm going to try this from the top of my head. Go to Settings, Accessory Settings, and look for either Sync Bluetooth Devices or Headset Settings. Then before you do anything else next, have your bluetooth headset in pair mode. Press and hold the power button on your headset for about 10-15 seconds. Depending on your headset, you should either get a solid colored light letting you know it's in pair mode. Then just hit the sync button and enter your password (it's 0000 ).|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Go to Accessory Setting, go to manage Bluetooth. and click new and search make sure your bluetooth are in pairing mode.

TbTO5SXlaa	The A200 is a very good choice. It has the Sony version of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. Therefore, any lens you use will be stabilized. Nikon and Canon have their versions of IS in the lens so you get to pay for it every time you buy a lens - and not every lens they offer has it.    Don't be overly concerned about one company claiming 59 lenses while Sony "only" offers 25. Every Minolta Maxxum AF lens made since 1985 can be used on your A200 - and every one will have the IS benefit. (I counted 61 Minolta/Sony lenses on the wikipedia site).    So buy the A200 with its standard 18-70mm zoom and a UV filter and a circular polarizer. As you grow your photographic skills you can begin thinking about additional lenses and accessories.    Don't waste money on cheap, no-name filters. Buy from Hoya, B+W, Heliopan, Tiffen, Singh-Ray. I suggest getting your two filters in a "thin" or "slim" mount to avoid possible vignetting at 18mm.|`|th7r2OD0aa	i love mine :-)  i highly recccomend it and as sony gets to be a larger dslr company they will release more and more lenses so dont worry about that.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It is an excellent camera period.  Just be aware that if you ever go pro, you will want to own a Nikon or Canon system .... they have all the lenses (59 current vs. 25 Sony lenses) and Sony has yet to provide the lenses that sports and wildlife photographers need.  400 mm f/2.8 and 600 mm f/4 lenses.

Your moron boyfriend is. The solution to the problem is to tell him to go to...wherever...and move on. This way, you don't have to put up with his jealous crap, and you can move on with your life.    You think he's nosy now? Stay with him, then see what happens. And God help you if he sees something that makes him suspicious and you don't have an explanation that he likes.    Walk away from him now and don't look back.    I'm not some kid. I'm a 54-year-old husband and father of a 22-year-old, and I've been married to the same woman for almost 30 years.

Why are you still in the relationship. What if he hit you? Would you ask us what's the best face mask to wear, or how to defend yourself?     Your phone should have a key lock or phone lock, use a random password that you can remember and don't enter it in front of him. All phones have a key or phone lock - it goes into lock mode when the screen goes black after being idle for a bit. The SIM lock is good, but it doesn't lock down the phone, just the SIM card. He can still look through your phone. It just means he's can't edit any numbers on the SIM or any security settings on it.     Really, guys like that are very bad news. Looking through a phone is one thing, if there is a reason for it but the way you talk about it...  Get away from him.    EDIT:  If you have it taken care of then why are you still worried about him snooping? No one is saying he IS abusing you, just that he probably will in the future if you keep on the path you're taking with him.    This may help you inchanging your PIN, PUK and so on. Enter them like you're dialing a number, just don't hit the call button.    Change SIM Card PIN  ** 04 * old PIN * new PIN * new PIN      Change SIM Card PIN 2 (Write down the new code)  ** 042 * old PIN * new PIN * new PIN      Change SIM Card PUK (Write down the new code)  ** 05 * old PUK * new PUK * new PUK      Change SIM Card PUK 2 (Write down the new code)  ** 052 * old PUK * new PUK * new PUK      Display Handset IMEI  *  06  |`|WlnUQBNUaa	it probably will keep him out.    but i don't think you should date someone like that if you have to hide everything. tell him that you want trust and you'll, in return, give him complete honesty. what your doing is no way to live.|`|PrarLmbxaa	You dump before he starts becoming even more possesive.  The jealousy and looking through your stuff is him trying to control your life.  Trying to possess you, own you.  The longer you stay in the relationship the worse it will get.  You need to either talk to him and make him understand that he needs to trust you, or break up with him.  I know this is now what you asked about, but YOU used the word psycho, and you are saying he is constantly going through your stuff.  That is how bad things start.  Trust me, if he can't respect you and quit with the snooping and any jealousy that may arise, then you need to leave him before he gets worse.  Because then he will be worse, and when you try to leave him he will be a much worse person about it.|`|4b00d9a31d6a0bab2ccf1a1493eca11faa	How about a changing the locks on your front door?  Why the hell would you put yourself in a position where you are dating someone like that?  Seriously, even if your self esteem is low, there are many other guys out there that need a girlfriend.  How about you grow up, ditch the loser and find yourself a real man.  Someone that is actually cares about you and is confident enough to give you the space you need and deserve.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	If you tell him to stay out of your stuff and he still sneaks into your things he is not much of a boyfriend. Most normal people who ask their boyfriends or girlfriends to stay out of the stuff, stay out of their stuff.

iivrDlvCaa	Well technically a contract is an agreement between two parties - you agree to pay a monthly fee and in return they provide you with a service. It seems that they are unable or unwilling to provide you with the service you are paying for and they are therefore in breach of the contact, which should give you grounds to cancel the contract (but you must give them reasonable time to sort out your problems first). It seems you've been more than fair, giving them ample time to sort out the problems to no avail. I'd write them a letter, stating that you consider them to be in breach of contract and state your problems as supporting evidence. Don't take no flannel about them saying it's covered in the terms and conditions of your contract (the old "acts of God" line they spout everytime they know they haven't addressed your problem correctly). Give them a reasonable deadline to respond (21 days) and if they do not, then I suggest seeking legal advice or going to your local citizen's advice bureau. This course of action means sticking to your guns, but if you deal with the matter calmly and professionally, then in my experience they may make a goodwill gesture and cancel your contract early with no fee or at the very least they will sit up and take notice of your problems. Good luck!|`|NB4QKLUiaa	i was going to ask this question, thanks!|`|V8uvefQDaa	I had exactly the same problem! Unfortunately I had to stick out the remainder of my contract.

EXpaRBsyaa	When you dropped your machine, did it land on the handwheel end?  If so, it's possible you just jammed the upper main shaft against the rear main bushing.  Does the machine "hum" when you push down the foot pedal?  Does the light work?  If you answered NO to the last 2 questions, it's probable that the electrical connections are broken.  It won't cost you anything to get an estimate in most repair shops, and it isn't recommended that you attempt repairing the machine yourself once it has been dropped.  You would be surprised how much the repair bill goes up once the customer attempts repairing a machine which has been dropped, wheras the mechanic (fully trained) will have little if any difficulty performing the repair if it hasn't been tinkered with by a well-meaning spouse or friend, or such.  Best wishes.|`|qmUW3u6Raa	It's possible you broke your machine.  Fortunately there are still sewing shops available that fix sewing machines of any age.    Search in your local yellow pages online to find a sewing machine repair shop near you.

If it does then probably you have caused part of the plug to come loose on the machine side.  Take it to a sewing machine technician where they sell sewing machines.

Another component is the receiver/amplifier.

1ikxwGYLaa	Personally, I can't fault and won't ever move from my Beyer DT100s, as used by broadcasters, OBs, journalists, and DJs all over the world.  They're not 'cool' looking - in fact, they look like grey rectangles - but at 1W per channel *THAT* close to your ears, they're GOOD, they're LOUD, and they're very comfortable to wear for long periods.<br>  <br>  They also block out a lot of noise, and don't have a swivel mount on one or both sides, so not best for 'club' DJing, or beatmatching.

z88IMXNFaa	Ebay has the best selection.  Prices run from about $150 for a used first geeration iPhone to about $800.  I believe Apple's price for a new 3G without an AT&T contract runs about $500-$600 for the 8 GB and $800-$850 for 16 GB.|`|TlMjt3Qmaa	300

04eafb69155ec13696383ffa67cdd1f9aa	I used T-Mobile when I was in Germany, I like them the best and they are available in the United States so that's great too.<br>  <br>  SIM cards are the best things in the entire world, they are little white chips that hold all of your information on your phone (not usually pictures though) and they can be easily taken out of phones all over the world except the US.<br>  <br>  Why? Because of  United States Cellular phone market, being annoying as always, wants to corner the market, incorporating the SIM cards in the phones, so you can't just buy a new phone and switch it out.<br>  <br>  It was extremely useful for me if my battery ran out and I didn't want to use up someone else's minutes so I just switched the phone/SIM cards and voila! Instant phone.<br>  <br>  But the American phone companies don't want people to know this, because it's a no brainer and they want people to spend all sorts of money on crap and extras.<br>  <br>  If you want a global phone, you just need to get a Tri- (just in Europe) or a Quad-band phone to access the other networks (you'll be roaming unless you temporarily switch phones, but it's not that expensive usually)|`|z88IMXNFaa	Below is a link to cell phone use in Europe.  It look like the best option is to rent a phone in Europe.<br>  <br>  As for your local service, Verizon tends to have the best coverage.  If that doesn't work for you, I'd try AT&T.  One thing to know is that most, if not all of the cell phone companies have a trial period (if I recall correctly, AT&T's is 30 days).  If you find that the phone or the service doesn't work for you, you can return the phone and cancel the service.  I did this with T-Mobile some years back (it was a two week trial).|`|TqspiY93aa	I live in Oregon and have Verizon and it works great! I would suggest sticking with Verizon. I'm pretty sure that Verizon will work in Europe since it's partners with Vodafone which is a big cell phone company in Europe.

So if you have Verizon in your area, you will have to wait until your contract is up, or if they have merged completely by then, 90 days before ur contract is up. Then you will officially be Verizon.

ssoZ33XIaa	Is this a song you have had on your player before?  If not, make sure it is in a format that is compatible with the Zune.  For example, it cannot play a protected AAC files purchased from iTunes, so if it is in an incompatible format, you will need to convert it.  Or perhaps your memory is full and there is no room for it on the player at the moment.  Check how much storage space is left on the device to see if this is the problem.  I don't have a Zune, so I'm not too familiar with the software, but perhaps you previously told it to skip that particular song and now a setting needs to be changed somewhere?  Those would be the first things I would check.

If you put any of your own music on the player, that will still work just fine.  Any files you actually own, those not from Rhapsody, will be unaffected by canceling your subscription or by charging your player on the same or a different computer.

The balanced reduction of environmental noise guarantees a perfect spherical sound, while the complete sound spectrum is reproduced in great detail from the lowest sub bass up to the highest frequencies. The higher frequencies are crystal-clear without being unpleasant and impress with a very smooth sound. The precise balanced mid frequencies are analytical and supportive, without being predominate. The bass is voluminous without being too obtrusive. This is a headphone for your inspiration. Beyerdynamic's designers took different human anatomies into consideration and made the headband more variable in lengths in order to fit perfectly on everyone's head. The tight headband pressure that is used for professional versions was reduced for this version to guarantee permanent listening without a "vice-like grip". The single-sided cable plus the optional extension cable allow more freedom of movement. The revised design gives the DT 880 a modern, attractive appearance. The package is rounded up by a stylish high quality aluminum box. In this box you can keep your headphone safe from dust and dirt and it blends perfectly into the ambience.<br>  hope this helps!!! :)|`|yVMGqyIwaa	bose or sennheiser OR jaybird wireless headphones!<br>  <br>  i have wireless headphones and they are very good<br>  <br>  EDIT: these r jaybirds... <br>  <a href="http://www.jaybirdgear.com/bluetooth-stereo-headphones-buy.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.jaybirdgear.com/bluetooth-ste...</a>|`|vbrbmBaZaa	BOSE headphones and noise cancellation systems are the best!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop...</a>|`|MP2OEEnDaa	Quiet Comfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones<br>  are about the best without going too crazy.<br>  www.bose.com<br>  if you wanna spend less go to www.koss.com for good ones but Bose is Best!|`|5ersliP6aa	nixon just came out with a brand new line that you should check out. by far the best looking..

So here's how to get the symbols:<br>  <br>  1. Using your computer, copy these characters to the notepad ? ? ?<br>  Save the notepad and transfer it to your phone via mass storage (USB), PC Suite, or bluetooth. Copy it to a place where you can easily locate it.<br>  <br>  After transferring, Locate the file using your "File Manager" and open the file you have just transferred.<br>  <br>  Do you know how to use copy and paste? Highlight the characters by pressing the copy/paste button (pencil icon). After selecting, press again the copy/paste button then press copy.<br>  <br>  So if you want to use the characters copied, for example on your bluetooth name, just press the copy/paste button then select Paste.<br>  <br>  2. Or if you know someone already have the symbols/characters, ask him to copy and paste the characters using the Notes application on the phone itself then send it to you. Follow the above steps, and there you go!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Thanks a lot!

bIi0GSx5aa	I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school. They are a great convenience if you need to contact your parent(s) to get picked up after school This is helpful especially if you have some type of extracurricular program. It would be cumbersome to have to go to the office every time you wanted to update with or contact your parents. The office would be crowded on certain occasions. They should be controlled though. They should be put up on vibrate, and somewhere that you wouldn't hear them, should they go off. They should not be used for fun because of obvious distractions. They should be used solely for emergency or routine contacts for you and your ride.|`|cL1K7NHZaa	A loud cellphone is annoying anywhere.  However, having cell phones in school should not be allowed.  They cause distractions and I know that my teenage son will completely stop whatever he is doing to answer his phone as soon as it rings... including at dinner, which is why it is not allowed at the dinner table either.|`|VG4r3miJaa	You should be allowed to keep them on silent in your locker, but not in class.  In an emergency there is no reason why the school could not be notified and you made away.  Several issues can come from cellphone use in the classroom.  They can be a distraction from learning, or can be used to cheat on exams through text messages or my taking a photo of the exam and passing it off to other students.|`|Ons8CCojaa	I think they should be allowed in during passing period but not in class. I hate my school because you cant have it on at any time of the day except after school.

xBgxqfGRaa	The Nokia 5800 "comes with music" does not literally mean that when you buy it, there are already songs stored in its 8BG Micro SD card included inside the box... (if it does,  maybe some songs are not of your liking)<br>  <br>  It means that upon purchasing the phone, you get free 100 licensed songs downloadable on the Universal Studio Media Downloads directly using your phone. Take note its FREE and you have the freedom of which songs you like.<br>  <br>  You use the device itself and download tracks on the Universal Studio website. Upon purchasing, the full instructions can be read in one of the flyers attached for your convenience.<br>  <br>  The experience on the handset is a bit fresh. It combines the user-friendliness of the usual Symbian OS found on older Nokia phones while employing new features such as fading effect, screen rotation, refreshed music player and web experience, as well as viewing images and videos through its updated gallery feature.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!<br>  <br>  Thank you!
hWc65sEtaa	You can't.  Put the phone on vibrate.
xTioPxaVaa	It kind of depends on your definition of good distortion, which would relate to what style of music you're playing.<br>  <br>  As far as bang for the buck,  a few guys here in town have been raving about the Peavey Joe Satriani model.  I've got to admit, it's one of the better clean channels I heard in a production amplifier.  The Ultra drive channel is a bit much for me, but that's just personal taste.<br>  <br>  The new Marshall JVM series has the best clean channell I've ever heard on a Marshall.  Period.  The distortion channels on that amp are more usable to me, but I spend a lot of time if the mid-gain crunch world.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

wQ8qTC8Faa	Well if you want vintage i would suggest the classic vibe 50's strat. It has a maple neck which is warm and a slim neck too. It is 300$. Eric Clapton played a 50's guitar with a maple neck too. You could put Tex Mex pickups for a hotter sound also. Also a G-400 SG is a nice guitar. It is a Rock Guitar and has easy access to high frets but it cost 400$ but it is a really great guitar.

Plug it into your computer  so it can charge. This happens to me all of the time.|`|hWTMDOPdaa	Go to the Apple store! They can fix it. Same thing happened to me, but I droped mine in water.
