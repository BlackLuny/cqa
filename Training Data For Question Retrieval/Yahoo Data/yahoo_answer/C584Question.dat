I'm a 17 year old female, and I have more phobias/fears than a 4 y/o who's going to bed after watching a horror flick.    Let's see, I'm afraid of...bees, holding animals (I'm fine being with animals, I'm comforted in fact, I just can't pick them up), crowds, and power outages at night.    These fears are so ridiculous and irrational. I'm almost an adult here, and I get panicky during the most minor situations.  I had a power outage last night, and I was by myself.  It was around 9:00, and I FREAKED OUT.  I called my mom, begging her to let me go for a walk outside or study at a coffee shop (half a mile away) with emergency lighting.  She yelled at me and hung up on me.  I spent the next hour pacing back & forth, with a few flickering flashlights on.  I don't like picking up animals, because I have this irrational, crazy idea that if I pick them up, they'll snap and attack me (especially my face).

20090225150638AAO0Eu6	Health;Women's Health	Sharp, on again off again pain in right breast? - Could it be from weight lifting?	This morning I experienced this sharp pain in my right breast.   From what I remember, it kind of radiated from my nipple outwards.      I'm 16, and from what I can tell, there aren't any lumps present.      I felt this pain on and off again throughout the school day.   Probably for a total of maybe 7 or 8 times so far today?   It happens, and then I'll be fine for the next hour or two.      Could this be a result of weightlifting, as in maybe I pulled or irritated something?      I was in the gym yesterday for about an hour, and I do a lot of upper body, pectoral-type exercises   [for my back, it's part of psychical therapy to treat my severe scoliosis]      I'm on my period, if that helps any.   [about day 3 out of my usual 6-7]   This isn't the usual soreness that comes along with it though.         Thanks for any help!   [=

20090225145425AA7WGC9	Health;Mental Health	Whats Wrong With My Sleep?!?! (Read Details)?	Sometimes when I am asleep its just like a normal snooze, but then when I feel as if I'm gonna wake up I all of a sudden feel numb all over and the only thing I can do is open my eyes only a little bit (I could even think of a whole conversation or Memory to myself). I can't move my body at all. It's like I'm half awake half asleep. I once tried to lift my arm when I was in that paralyzed state and I felt it lift but it wasn't moving and I was looking directly at my arm. The only thing that could snap me out of it is if there is some sort of noise like an alarm clock ring or something, or if I some how get enough energy to sit up as if I just awoke from a nightmare. I also got paralyzed like that another time and Its was hot in the room but I was paralyzed so I couldn't do anything. but then I got up and went out of my room without even opening the door and turned up the air conditioning and I don't even remembering going back to my bed but then all of a sudden I snaped out of that paralyzed state once again and my brother then yelled at me for turning up the air conditioning but...I couldn't move..its confusing and hard to explain but...I some how managed to get up and turn on the air conditioning without leaving my bed...but i left something in order to do that. This all started happening after I got shocked by an electric cord about 9 years ago. And one other time when I got like that I alll of a sudden, outta nowhere, heard music supper loud. It was a song i could'nt reconize. I even thought to myself "Whens it gonna end?!". Then finally it stoped and I woke up completely, and to my suprize, my radio was off. Whats wrong with me?

20090225150039AAqZwPK	Health;Optical	What's wrong with my new glasses?	So last week I took an eye exam and I barely got my glasses today.  During the eye exam I told the doctor, when he was finished, that what was on the wall didn't look right.  So he did it again, and the second time around it was better but was still a little off, so I figured my eyes just need to adjust.  Now I have my new glasses and I'm experiencing the same thing as from the doctor’s office.  Everything is clear, but it’s kind of fuzzy or slight double vision, especially when I'm indoors.  When I drive they seem fine.  When I change the location of my eyes to look at something else it seems like it takes a second or two to adjust.  My previous glasses did not do any of this.  As to my prescription, it only changed a little.  However, I used to only have astigmatism in one eye now I have it in both.  Doctor wants me to try them out for a couple of days before I go back for adjustments.  Any thoughts on what is wrong?

20090128235715AAFtZWz	Health;Optical	Employer's having to pay for eye tests?	Settle an argument for me, I am 99% sure UK employers have to pay for eye tests if you work on a computer and didn't need glasses before you started (and suddenly do), but if you had poor eyes to start with you have to pay for them yourself.       My colleagues are determined ALL employers must pay for all eye tests if you work on a computer.       Who is right?

20090129015957AAOfaGS	Health;Women's Health	Missed period for 4 months- w/ neg test... sometimes.?	Where should I start...   2 years ago I found out I was pregnant for the first time. I was pretty sure I was, but my tests kept comming out negative. Finally, I went to the doctor and it came up positive. i had been missing my period for about 3 months at that point. ( By the way, I've always had a really odd period cycle- Always too late, or too early, or often skipping months all togeather. So I didn't really think any different of it.) Anyway, a month after I found out i was pregnant, I had a really bad miscarriage (which landed me in the Emergency room).       Its now January 29th, 2009. The last period I had was September 25th, 2008. I've taken pregnancy tests that have come out negative & others come out as a faint positive. I went to Planned Parenthood for another test about a month ago, and the first test was a light positive, and a second test came out negative. I almost feel like I'm having signs of pregnancy, but I don't want to get my hopes up. (I'm terrified of having another miscarriage). For a while now, I've been throwing up at random times. But only recently, I've been throwing up right after I orgasm. It only happens when I am on top, but as soon as I orgasm I have to run to the bathroom. I don't know why, It's never happened before. Today, for the first time ever, I was in the shower and I got so dizzy I blacked out and had to jump out of the shower and sit on the toilet, or else I would have fallen down. I was on dinner duty tonight, and I kept having to need my boyfriend help me, because every couple minutes i would start blacking out, to the point where I had to sit down and drink water. I don't know if any of this is relevant, but I'm telling all right now. Also, a while ago every night I was having very noticable cramps. But that has gone away, and now I just feel continuously sick throughout the day. I don't throw up anymore, but I'm constantly noticing a "tossed up" feeling in my stomache.       What's going on? Any ideas? And, I have an appointment for the doctors in a week, so I'm just looking for advice from my fellow women.

20090129012906AA6D99K	Health;Optical	First time contact lens user - HELP!?	Hi. It's my second day of having my soft lens. I use Acuvue. I have a really hard time putting them on, usually it takes me 30 minutes to an hour, it's really frustrating.     I can't put them on by looking directly at the lens as it is coming at my eye - my eye involuntarily blinks when it comes in contact. So what I do is hold it up to the eye, look up, then insert it in (in the white part) then when I look back down it slides in to the middle. Is this okay? Is this proper?    Also, it takes me so many tries before I can get them in, which means numerous light poking. Also, it stings since I'm not used to it. Is this normal? I'm scared of getting abrasions in my eye.     Oh, and it feels weird, like something's in your eye. Is this normal for first-timers? Or is it because my eye is too dry? I'm afraid of putting drops in, is it possible that the contacts get dislocated when you do so?     Sorry for the many questions, please answer if you can. Thanks!

20090128205358AAoxebF	Health;Mental Health	I think I'm addicted to boys...?	Every time I see a guy I instantly evaluate his relationship potential. Even if I'm completely unattracted to him, I'll flirt. If someone asks me out, there's no question that I'll go, and then even if it's the worst experience in the world I'll have trouble saying no the next time. I feel obligated to make boys like me, I crave their attention. I've been hooking up with a guy I have no attraction to, don't even really like, but I'm always wondering if I've done something wrong if he doesn't IM me or text in a while or something. What's wrong with me?? I get compliments all the time that I'm pretty, and it's not like I have problems getting a guy-I just have no confidence when it comes to them, or that they'll stick around. I have terrible self esteem, and I really just start to obsess over what a guy thinks about me. How can I stop this?!  Right now, I'm starting to date someone who's (according to mutual friends) very interested in me, but when I'm with him I can't read/overthink the signs and it's driving me insane! I'm constantly worried that he doesn't like me -that in itself isn't the problem, I'm ok with guys not liking me if I know it, I'm just so afraid I'm being led on. Help?!?

I hear from many people that there is no such thing as "target" toning and that you will just have to decrease your overall weight to lose stomach fat. Is this true?      I do not wish to be recommended to any workout dvds and such, simply because I doubt I will be able to find them (and I prefer not to shop online).      I own a treadmill, an elliptical, and weights at my home, if that helps any.      Thank you.

20090128210312AARY0ht	Health;Women's Health	Period questions....?	1. How can I bring pads/tampons with me everywhere if people (especially guys) like to snoop around in my bag?      2. How do you transfer a pad/tampon out of a backpack to another bag without it being seen? Pockets don't count.       3. My periods are still irregular, so how can I at least predict when it comes? I can't keep going to the bathroom each hour of the school day to check. But if I don't, I'll start smelling bad and bleeding all over my chair, and that would be very, very embarrassing.       4. So the solution appears to be, "just wear a pad/tampon 24/7". Isn't that a waste of money and material, though?
