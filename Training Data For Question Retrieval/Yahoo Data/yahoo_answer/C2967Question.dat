20090309174317AAIiDom	Environment;Green Living	Questions on waste and recycling?	1 Explain why you think the treatment of prescribed or hazardous wastes needs to be closely monitored?         2. As you know Australia has large amounts or uranium which we are selling to Russia and India. One of the aspects of the sale is being negotiated, which is that we in australia are being asked to store any uranium waste. Many Australians are unhappy about what might happen to the radioactive waste in these countries. It may be dumped into the environment or used to build nuclear weapons. It has been suggested that the nuclear waste should be returned to Australia for storage to ensure it is disposed of correctly      (a) Is Australia in any way responsible for what happens to the waste and why?      (b) How do we ensure that the waste is managed properly?         (c) If it is returned to Australia Would you be happy to support a uranium waste repository (storage facility) in your neighbourhood? why or why not? if not where should it go?      thanks please help!
