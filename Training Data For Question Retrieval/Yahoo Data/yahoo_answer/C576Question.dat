My hair itches everyday. It always feels like little bugs are biting my scalp or like when someone pulls one strand of your hair. I definitely don't have lice, and I don't think I have psoriasis because my scalp isn't scaly. I've tried every dandruff shampoo and nothing works. My dermatologist couldn't even help me. I sometimes wear a sew in weave but have to take it out within a week because my hair is so itchy. Can anyone suggest any real solutuions that worked for them. I'm not looking for obvious answers but real solutions. Thanks for your help.

Last month I took Plan B when my boyfriend's condom slipped off as he was pulling out.   Usually I am on the Nuva Ring but mine had expired and I needed to order new ones when this happened.

I don't have any symptoms of pregnancy besides the missed period.   I feel perfectly normal.      I'm going to see my OBGYN next week to get a blood test done but I'm scared right now.

20090226102026AAi8SD9	Health;Mental Health	I feel alone all the time, and I can't stop self harming?	When I was young, I had barely any friends. In primary school, the only two friends I had admitted they actually hated me before we went to different schools, and they had just made up lots of excuses not to be with me before.        Then in my next school, I was treated as a freak for 3 years. I was the type of person people never wanted to be with, and the image stuck. I even got bullied by the sister of one person, getting punched and called names. That was my fault though, as I told my brother the type of things the sister had said to me and he scared her.       In year 6 I actually got some friends, 3 nice outgoing people. but then they started running away from me for fun, and again treating me like a freak. I'm still friends with 2 of them, as they were following the others lead.      In secondary school, that had a big impact on me. I felt like I would never fit in, and still people think I'm a freak. I really want people to like me, but now whenever I'm talking to people I feel really awkward, and I always read the body language as them feeling it too. Whenever someone doesnt want to talk or be with me, or when they say something bad about me, I get really down and feel like everyone hates me. I still dont have many friends, and none of them would count me as a best friend, but it's still better than before so I should be happy, right? I cant even remember the last time I was happy. I think I'm a b**** who cant even get any real friends. I cen never stand up for myself, and whenever I say anything wrong I feel really bad and guilty. In class I'm the best most of the time, and whenever I dont get exactly the best I should get I get really, really down. Last year, when I first started secondary school, I started self harming to feel distant from bad feelings like that, and tried to kill myself. I still get loads of suicidal thoughts, and I still self harm. I tried to give up a few times, but in the end I gave up as I was too weak, and I dont think deep down I even wanted to give up. I was walking home today, and a group of boys called my a freak, and other things. I don't think anythings ever going to change. My family is having enough problems right now, so I cant' talk much to them. The only person I could talk to is my half-brother, who used to self harm, but hes in prison so we cant talk.  they know I used to be bullied, but they just say I have to try harder. My parents dont know about the suicidal thoughts, and they think self harming is just a trend. I know it sounds corny, but I really just want someone to wrap their arms around me and love me, even just as a friend. But it feels like no-ones ever going to like me. I dont want to think like this, but it's just what happens every time.    Please can I have some advice, I just feel really alone...

My class had started walking outside so i stood up, i waited for my coach and told him i really had to go call my mom because i felt really sick. he said hold on, and walked into his office, everyone else had left the gym.   then i remembered being on floor thinking i had laid down but realized i had fainted. the coach came in and picked me up and walked me to the front office. as we started walking, i could not see anything at all.everything  was a goldish color and looked spotty. everyone told me i was pale. a few minutes after, my color came back and felt ok, but then i got a head ache that wont go away      that morning i had drank some poweraid, i dont drink alcohol, and this has never happened before. im 16

About 2 weeks ago I missed a pill, now this has happened before and i simply took the pill I missed and the one for that day when I remembered. This has happened before and never causes any change, it's perfectly safe and according to my doctor i should be protected as long as it was taken the next day.      However about 3/4 days later, I began spotting, rather heavily. It wasn't enough blood to be a period, but I used very light tampons to avoid ruining my underwear. This continued throughout the rest of my packet of pills, until my period break.   I then got my period as usual. But now, i came off my period today and i noticed that instead of blood, I have a thick and light pink discharge.   This has never happened before...I wondered if it's normal.      Thank you

I was given a firm diagnosis after repeated biopsies and tests, since this cancer is so uncommon. The cancer was caught early enough that I don't need kemo therapy. I will have surgery to remove the cancer, and because of the location (foreskin) that means circumcision. I'm glad that I'm going to be ok, obviously, but still sad I'm getting circumcised. I've always jacked off by sliding my foreskin up and down over my glans, and I can't imagine masturbating by just rubbing the bare head. So, how do you circumcised guys deal with this problem? Also, is there anyone on here who's gotten circumcised as ann adult that could tell me what it's like? Thanks.       Nathan.

He found two cavities (which didn't surprise me, my old dentist knew they were there but thought they were too small to worry about yet) but also that five teeth with composite resin fillings-ie, all the teeth I have fillings on, I think-were suffering from decay around the filling.  He feels they need to be refilled, and he prefers using amalgam fillings because they last longer, etc.  My question-are those safe?  I've seen arguments on both sides, but can't get a definitive answer.  I'd like to know before I get the first tooth worked on, perhaps even before I decided to keep this person as my dentist.

I really enjoy the classes at the gym, particularly the weight classes. I'm happy with my results, but I don't FEEL my workouts anymore.  I feel them when I'm doing them, but I'm never sore afterwords anymore.       Should I be feeling the muscle soreness? Is this a good indicator of a good workout? Why aren't I sore anymore?      Suggestions and advice would be appreciated.

Over the last four months I've gained 20 lbs. and went from 123 lbs. to 143 lbs., but want to go back to 123 lbs.  I actively exercise a couple hours per day, but was in the habbit of exercising six or more hours per day.  My food intake also went up, the seasons kind of hit me hard.  Anyway, I would like to email with someone (at least once per day) who is fairly intense into exercise and weight loss and wants to compete to see who can drop 20 lbs. the fastest.  We don't to really email about anything other than dropping weight, and our efforts in so doing.  Gender/age/etc. none of that matters... I want someone or someone(s) to compete against.
20090226134623AAjENMV	Health;Mental Health	Is abuse -- physical or psychological -- ever "deserved"?	I am friends with a married couple. The husband is physically and mentally abusive -- I have witnessed the terrible verbal abuse, and I know he has been arrested for domestic violence, and has even broken bones.      But if you sit down and talk to him, he makes it seem like it's his wife's fault. He says, "I may be mean to her, but I have a reason. She treats me so horribly -- she is so mean to me -- for no reason." Even though I hate myself for it, and I feel as if I am being manipulated, I feel like maybe she makes his life miserable for him and he is just retaliating.      Is there ANY way she deserves his treatment of her -- is it really, as he says, a two-way street?

I like to be hungry, starving. I know that's weird, but it makes me feel like I'm doing something right with weight loss. I'm at a "healthy" weight now, but I'm at the top of the healthy range, so I am fat. All that I ever think about is dieting. Nothing else seems as important or entertaining to me. When I diet, I usually have about 500 calories or less. When I try to eat the right amount, I end up having a giant binge. I don't even know why. I don't like to binge. I just do it anyway. I don't think straight when I'm binging. When I'm done, it's like I don't even know what happened. I purge occasionally. VERY occasionally. I haven't done it in a week and the time before that was months ago. So, how can I stop this? I really want to be normal?

She like talks out of her head  I know this would be normal for someone that had been going on very little sleep, but she does it even if she has had a full nights sleep.  She is also having trouble remembering things. And she will say something and not ever remember saying it.  She forgets to pay her bills on time as well.      I am very concerned about her! I know that diabetes can affect your memory but what should I do? Anytime I try talking to her about going to the doctor she always puts it off and says that she cant afford it.  which it true, but I am afraid that this is going to kill her.       Anyone know anything about this?
20090226134237AAIBd6n	Health;Mental Health	If I told a councilor about my S-I, would they have to tell my parents?	No rude comments please...      I've been cutting for a while now and really want to talk to someone about it. My friend found out and asked if I was still doing it and I said no and she never asked again. My teachers sometimes ask me if i'm okay but I just say 'yes'. I wish I would say 'actually no I'm not' then maybe they'll ask more but I just hate the attention.    My question is, if I told a teacher or someone and got refered to a school councilor, would they tell my parents? I really don't want my parents to know. It would upset them so much and I just couldn't deal with it.       I'm 17 years old, 18 in June.      Thanks.

I used to work out, go to the gym a lot, but I did a lot of strength and muscle training and not much cardio, and my diet didnt really change, so I was able to pack a really good amount of muscle on my body.

I have contsant diarrhea, occassional constipation, cramping, bloating, etc. I go to the bathroom and I can't finish, even though I still feel like I have to go. I can never get everything out. This happens every time, I almost have never felt I got 100% of everything out. My stool is very inconsistent and usually thin, in very small pieces or liquid. Almost everything I eat irritates it and I always feel like I have to go again right after I've been to the bathroom. Is this all common with IBS or should I see a doctor?

I want to get from my 24" vertical to 30" by summer (3 months)   By doing average workouts in the weight room could I get 6 inches in 3 months?   By workouts I mean Leg press, squat, lunges, and the machine where you sit down and have your legs up in front of you and push the weight with just you feel. keeping your legs completely straight.   It is like the things you do standing and you lift your body with your "toes"   Also doing quick high jumps and sprints and stairs every other day.      P.S all of the above work outs would be done with a day break.   So I would do them on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

My FIL  has always been a stubborn, difficult, and demanding person.   It is getting worse.  He won't admit there is a problem, however, in the recent months, he's become paranoid, easily angered, easily disoriented, has problems finding the right words, and becomes strongly opinionated on things in the opposite way he's always felt.  No one in the family wants to discuss the issue, and I'm the one who has had to raise the important conversations about safety around my son (ie, getting rid of the gun in the house, driving, etc.)      There are several parts to my question:   -  He seemed to be stable, and suddenly deteriorating.  Is this normal?  Will he become stable again?   -  His physical health is also deteriorating.  Is this normal?   -  We honestly didn't think he'd live very long at the beginning of this due to his health problems, but he's lived for 5 years.  How much worse can it get before he passes?   -  How can we start the conversation about the future if my FIL and MIL don't want to discuss it, and are in denial?   -  Is there a resource out there that can assist her?

Breakfast: a glass of skim milk, a yogurt, and a piece of peanut butter toast      Lunch: a weight watcher's bagel with 1/3 less fat cream cheese (200 calories)      Snack: a handful of almonds      Dinner: something healthy and vegetarian (like a veggie burger on a bun with low fat cheese and ketchup)      Dessert: a cup of sugar free jello         I would eat that, but allow myself to binge on whatever fruits and vegetables I want. I wouldn't have like potatoes or bananas or anything. I would just have like carrots and apples and those types of fruits. Is this good? Could I lose 20 pounds on it?

20090226153209AAaXT8b	Health;Other - Health	Extension to one of my previous questions:?	A few moments ago, I asked this question: - Is any attractive girl out there seriously into cooking and household chores as well as maintaining her looks?      Just to for some people's information, I am a single guys lodgin with my parents, I contribute in giving money for essentials/domestics, my mother suffers from arthritis and my father works full time, so I actually take care of most household duties like, ironing, washing (dishes) laundry, getting of grime from kitchen and bathroom, floor tiling, painting, hoovering, grocery shopping, gardening.....I am considered as a good looking guy, Although I am at the moment, slightly overweight due to dealing with depression, I like to take care of my appearance. But I am a man's man when it comes to getting my hands dirty. I must also have a shower/bath every day, change underwear everyday, not wear the same clothes for more than 2 days and keep things up to date and in order. I love nice food but want a good looking girlfriend who has pride and similar expectations to me. Is that a little too much to ask??? Am I ever gonna pull somebody fit who is down to earth and will listen to me???

I'm suppose to be making an appointment to get it placed again but now I'm worried that I'll constantly be paranoid that it might be misplaced and that I'm not being protected. And I have tried a lot of the other type of BC in the past and they just do not fit my lifestyle and are too complicated for me. Should I give the ParaGard another shot?

HOWEVER   it feels just like i am pretending, like im trying to convince myself i am (sick i know but honestly i cant help it). i just dont know where i stand anymore. i have already lost 6lbs in three days.      dont judge me. i am a normal person with a messed up life which has lead on to depression and bulimia and self harm.

20090226142815AA7MZhQ	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Keep feeling like I am going to hurt myself?	hi there, I have this strange problem. I don't self injure and haven't really done anything in the past to intentionally hurt myself.   however, lately, I can't help but almost constantly think of this. not like, seriously injure or kill myself, but just a bit. it feels like I would get major stress relief out of this, and feel better after I did it. the only reason I haven't done something yet is because I think that it's a vicious cycle and if I started then I wouldn't be able to stop. also, I get very addicted to things very easily. if I got even a small high out of cutting myself or something, I wouldn't be able to stop, likely. or if I did stop, it would be incredibly hard to do so. I don't want to start it just for that reason, but it seems like every day I have to choose not to do something like that. I don't know where to go from here.      also: I *do* know *why* I am feeling like this, it's just that it'd take too long to explain it here. but there is a reason that I think is valid as it is causing me incredible amounts of stress and all I want is a way that will alleviate the stress at least for long enough for me to feel better by the next time the problem comes around.      right now it's just like rapid fire, as soon as I'm done dealing with it once, it comes back again, and there's not enough of a mental rest in between. there is enough time to mentally calm down between each iteration but I can't calm down because I'm stressed for the next time I have to deal with it.

When all my best friends ditched me because I talked to their girlfriends too much. We are friends now but I feel like i'm still scard from it. I'm in 6th grade, and everything was going awesome until I had to go live with me dad, in another city. Living with him has really refreshed my mind about what he thinks about me. He's on the phone with this girl. One night they were talking about me, so I listened by his door. I have a older brother, and I was a mistake. I wasn't supposed to be here. He said that he had a plan for my brother but not one for me. And that if he could he would go back and slip a condom on so he wouldn't have to deal with me... At the new school I have no friends. Everyone thinks im the weird new kid. No one wants to talk to me. And I've just been growing more and more depressed each day. Can someone give me any advice on how to stop being so depressed?

I lost 20 pounds in one month from eating 400-800 cals a day, and in a few months I was 96 pounds.  At the time, everyone called me anorexic, but I wouldn't believe it.  I wasn't technically underweight.  Now looking back, that didn't matter, I showed major signs of anorexia (fine hairs all over body, slow heart beat, fear of even taking in tiny calories).  But I got better, and moved to 105-110 pounds in 8th grade and beginning of freshman year.  I realize now, I was definitely anorexic.  But now, being an ugly fat 125 pounds I miss it so much.  It wasn't just the weight loss, it was the discipline.  I of course used this discipline to lose weight, but I also was amazing in school.  Now, I don't have it.  At all.  I don't even count calories anymore I don't have as much discipline doing homework.  Dieting is useless.  I miss being anorexic, because I felt so much better about myself and clothes actually fit me, well.  It's causing me depression now because I feel like I lost all of that weight for nothing.   Does anyone feel like this? Any advice?

20090226095948AA44kj6	Health;Women's Health	What is going on here?	Ok, so me and fiance have been tying to conceive since last August. Last month I spotted for two days starting when I was supposed to have started my period.  We thought that it could have been implantation but my period came two days later and lasted for 5 out of the normal 7 days.  This month I experienced three-four days of clear, watery discharge after having my normal white, slippery CM for ovulation.  Then I had two days of spotting when I wiped then my period started Sunday night.  I had started taking prenatal vitamins about a month ago since I read that its a good idea when you are ttc.  Could the watery discharge been caused by that?  It was so much that when I stood up or moved around a lot if felt as if my period started and there was nothing there but wetness that looked as if I peed in my panties but not through them to the pants. Sorry if tmi, but I never had that happen before. Is this something I should ask the doc about or just accept it as a hormonal change?  Serious answers only and thanks in advance for your answers!

20090226163740AAXvg6l	Health;Alternative Medicine	Asian Green Tea vs. South American Green Tea?	Which do you think is better? I personally find the South American variety to be far better at combating viruses and things like that. There was a really bad stomach virus going around and I got extreme relief by drinking the South American Green Tea. But the Asian variety has a far better taste. I think when it comes to illness, the South American Green Tea is better at helping in that area. But if you just want good taste and antioxidants, the Asian variety is good for that. I was amazed at how strong the Argentina Green Tea is! I use the powder kind, and it only takes less than a half of teaspoon to make a 12 oz cup! Any more than that and the tea is much too strong to drink. I mean you can drink it, but the bitterness is hard to tolerate. What are your thoughts? And why is the South American Green Tea so different?

20090226100102AAWhbXG	Health;Women's Health	Is this my period again?	Right I had my period end on the 11th of February, I had sex on the 17th of February and we found out the condom split. I couldn't get plan b due to after school detention.. (teacher hates me) by the time I got out shops were shut.   So today I had to go to the bathroom so badly and was bursting for a pee. So I went to the bathroom I was running by this point, go into the bathroom finally. And in my underwear was a bit of blood.. Not much. But it has been a little bit for a while ish this after noon from 3:30pm to now which is 5:58pm.    Could this be implantation bleeding or just my period again.    I don't no you see. And I am waiting till the 5th to take a test because it would pick up hcg levels then.    I'm only asking because my period should not start again so soon.   What do you think?

20090226154856AAq4P7q	Health;Men's Health	Is this a normal pot high?	a little while ago. i got high with some buddies. we were outside and when it first started to hit me my legs felt a little shaky and the sky which was dark because of night looked like it was  glowing dark blue. then it really hit me. I felt like I was hearing people say the same things over and over again. It would feel like i was warping from one dimension to another. i couldent really think of anything to say because i didnt know if they would hear me. it felt like everything was spinning and going in slow  motion and then i would feel like i was back in reality for a couple seconds. this whole time warp thing/not really hearing what my buddies were saying kept up untill we all went to sleep. first question is is this normal? second I know people that go to school high and not get caught, if i was in school like that i would stick out like a sore thumb, so how do you keep yourself looking not high? third, does caughing make you more high because i caughed a lot? ps this was my first time getting high.

I was having a problem with my tooth and my dentist took x-rays so it also took x-rays of the teeth next to the problem tooth. If there were any problems with the other teeth the dentist will tell me right? He or she will look at the whole x-ray and not just the tooth you are complaining about right? I wanted to call my dentist's office but they are on a break for the next two weeks and I wanted to know if it's procedure or the law to look at all teeth on x-ray and see if there' s any problem with them and not just the one you are complaing about. Thanks I know this is weird but I'm just concerned since I cannot talk to my dentist. I forgot to ask during my visit...hence this question. Thanks!

That's not your fault that is how your body reacts to stress, If you eat when you are hungry and only hungry and maintain your weight then why is it such a bad thing that people are anorexic from time to time during stressful periods. It's not like we are killing ourselves faster than people that overeat and that are overweight.

This is my first time getting one (I haven't even gotten a cavity filling in my whole entire life), & I need someone to tell me what they do when they do this procedure.       I know, its going to hurt, but I can't just ditch the appointment because my tooth is killing me but anyways...       Here are some questions I have, & if someone can answer them that would be WONDERFUL & I would GREATLY appreciate it & its an easy 10 points. =).       1) On a scale of 1 - 10 how much does it hurt?       2) How long will the procedure take?       3) Will you feel more pain during the procedure, or after it?       4) After the procedure, will I still feel numbness, if so, how long will that numbness stay for?       5) Are there any tips on what I should ask the dentist for, (e.g. the stuff that make you numb) because I don't want to feel one single thing; if that's even possible.       6) How many people can come in the room with me, because I really wanted my aunt & my cousin to come in with me. (I know, I'm a scardey cat, but whatever, :P)       7) THAT'S IT, now just give me some tips of what to do before or after or DURING the root canal procedure & please wish me luck! =)          Thanks,      =).

My gcses are coming up in May so i've been doing a lot of revision lately i.e. going to lunchtime clubs that help you out further in the subject and making time to do more past-paper exams to get myself used to the idea of writing essays and exam styled questions etc. All this had left me with no time at all to work out. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week but now the only time i get time to exercise is during PE lessons which aren't very long anyway. I've had weight issues in the past and also been bullied about being slightly overweight, but i worked really hard to get into shape and i finally did .(went from uk size 16 to size 10) and for the past couple of months, because of no time I think i'm going back to my old shape and it is scaring me so much cause i hated being bullied. I had to get new trousers in November last year and now I'm a size 12.. I find myself getting really depressed and I think that i'll never lose weight by not eating ONE chocolate so i just go ahead and eat it and then i just eat another and another until i've ate so many which makes me even more depressed and i start eating all over again. Please help me with any good advice anyone may have.    I'm also going on holiday in june so i really want to get into fit shape. Is it realistic to say i would have lost quite a bit of weight in 4 months time?

20090226155235AAfeWEu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Any ideas on what this could be?	Okay, so about two months ago I went to the doctor because I was having some vaginal irritation. She told me that I had bacterial vaginosis and put me on metronizadole for it. I missed the last dose, but the pharmacist said that I still would have had enough to kill off the infection. At the same time as I started taking the antibiotic I stopped taking birth control.      Now, the problem is that since then, my discharge has been very unusual. I know this is kind of gross and too much information, but it's really thick and stretchy...almost stringy sometimes...and somewhat discolored. Basically, it looks like what you'd end up with if you blew your nose when you had a cold, and it's sticky enough that I can literally just pick it up off of my panties. Sometimes it has a weird, sort of vinegary smell.      Just to clarify, I do have an appointment with my doctor to discuss this, but I would really like some suggestions as to what the doctor should look for (I live in a small town, our health facilities aren't the best). Also, if it helps, I have been tested for chlamydia, siphylis, and HIV in the past, all have come back negative. I have not had sex in almost a year.      My question is...could it be stopping birth control that's causing this weird discharge, or something else entirely?

I tolerated the pain for like 3 to 4 day, the pain went away, thinking it wasn't a big deal, i just hurt my toe. Now i notice a curve at the knuckle at the nail making the whole toe curve More distinctively than the others, as where the same toe on my other foot, there is no curve, and my nail seems to be ... different. more thicker, rougher. when i push in the curve knuckle, it seems to lift the curve of my toe, making it in a normal position. i do feel discomfort sometimes.       Did i break?fracture my toe?    if so, is it a problem?   Is it okay to just leave it alone, since it has healed, but not correctly?

20090226132805AAQoZjP	Health;Diet & Fitness	How To Stay Out Of Gym And Not Get Caught?	ok so I hate, I mean HATE! P.E. class.   And I've been skipping lately and going straight to the media center/library and like just going on the computer and doing some work I get from my other teachers.   I've skipped probably almost 15 or more gym classes and I just can't stand to go there.   I hate the fact that guys and girls are separated in the gym because I don't feel right being with just the guys.   Im bi by the way.   I don't change in the guys locker room, I change in the bathroom or just slip on my sweats over my pants when I used to play gym.   and I see my gym teacher in the hallway in the morning all the time when I go hang out with friends at cafeteria for breakfast.   I'm thinking about stopping going to breakfast so I don't have to see him in the morning.      I need to know if there are any good ways to stay out of gym besides going to the media center.

20090226124954AAbrXwc	Health;Diet & Fitness	What is the best way to lose weight?	I need to lose 30-40 pounds to be in a healthy weight range.  I am a nursing student with a job so I have VERY little time to work out.  I am also a vegetarian with no money so it's tough buying really healthy food.  What would be the best way to lose this weight and keep it off?

20090226121416AA0izPm	Health;Diet & Fitness	Getting a bigger butt...?	Is it true that a lot of running makes your butt bigger? And that if you have bigger thighs, that usually means you have a big butt?      I want a bigger butt, but I also want to keep my legs toned and looking good. I have a good amount of leg muscle do to Cheerleading.      I honestly do think that I have gotten a bigger butt of gaining leg muscle. But, maybe I'm wrong?

20090226122801AAjqmEu	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I lose weight without gaining muscle?	I'm a drummer in my school's marching band, and i play Tenors (Quads). You need to be in very good shape to march around at 200bpm with those things on, because they are about forty pounds each.    I am a big guy, six foot three and a little less than 200 pounds, but i want to lose the fat on my stomach and thighs to be able to march and play better.   The thing is, i don't want to gain any muscles in my upper body, especially not my arms, because believe it or not, large biceps actually make it harder to drum, especially with tenors because your arms are moving around so much. what sort of exercises would i be able to do to lose weight and maybe gain some muscles in my legs and abdomen without gaining much if any muscles in my upper body? I'm essentially just trying to slim down, but i don't know how to do that without getting jacked.      I'm 15.
20090226132632AASvJKy	Health;Diet & Fitness	This is very simple to answer...?	This summer, I am going to Guatemala with some people from my church on July 6th, and the guy that I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY like is going, too. And I don't look my best, to be honest. I am about 10-15 pounds overweight, and Guatemala is of course very hot, so I will be wearing shorts and t-shirts and I want to look good in them. I am already very muscular, more than I should be because I played soccer for 6 years and I figure skate. I just have about an inch, maybe two inches in some places, of unwanted fat.      I eat healthy (meats, veggies, and no dessert, e.t.c), do pilates 5-6 days a week, and here is my figure skating schedule:      Friday night 7:30 to 9:00   Saturday morning 9:00 to 10:00   Saturday afternoon 1:00 to 3:00   Sunday afternoon 1:00 to 3:00   It is not vigorous ice skating, I just work on spins and stuff like that.       By the way, I just started pilates literally yesterday.       If I keep up with that healthy diet and exercise, how long will it take me to tone up and lose the extra pounds? Will I lose it by July 6th? I am 13 years old.
