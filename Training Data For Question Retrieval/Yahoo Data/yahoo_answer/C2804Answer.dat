pbV7dnKKaa	I would go to an Italian place or a Sushi place. Those tend to be more romantic to go to. Look at an online phone book to find those types of restaurants or restaurants that have the type of food that you like. There is a place called Yen Sushi and Sake Bar that might be nice to go to!|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Make-out Point|`|rko5Mz6Gaa	if you are comfortable with this person, then Mac.

Hope that helps <br>  <br>  also, you need something to support the download <br>  go to google<br>  type in downloads<br>  and then download bitcomet<br>  thats everything I use<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|uRoeRdKDaa	well, first off, sucking my dick might help.<br>  =)
f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	No. Actually the person there was very nice. My car broke down and I had to wait for a tow. She was very kind and offered me my beverage at no charge just because I was having a bad day.<br>  I wrote a letter to corporate about her to tell then what a gem they had.<br>  I have returned weekly since then.|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	The only bad experience I've had was when they forgot to make my drink I ordered.  But they were very nice about it, gave me a coupon for a free beverage and I was not even upset.  I deal with retail customers a lot on my job too, and sometimes people are just real jerks.  I've always had very pleasent experiences at Starbucks. Every one I have ever gone to, the people are very nice and friendly.|`|sMavrlx3aa	YES with food poisioning, but not with rude people. They're usually very nice, but I got food poisioning from there. I think the milk was bad, I'm not quite sure.<br>  <br>  but other than that no bad experience with people. :)|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	no but the cofee is no good , every one there is sweet , i love vanilla bean will you make me one ?|`|hivTXSQLaa	Yes people can be  mean. You have a job working with the public you have to have a thick skin. Some people can be rude and just out to destroy your day. Smile and tell them yes, give them the free cup they want and tell them to come back. Forget them just go on with your day they are sad people.|`|o2gjtUw9aa	its definately not yuro fault but sometiems the ques make people annoyed.  I was in a que for a shop and the guy in front had been waiting for 30 seconds and he started swearing liek wheres the !*@$ service here???<br>  <br>  i dont normally care but you know|`|5q7xTawhaa	Not me. people working at starbucks rock, even though they are always busy making our frapuchinos they always greet me when i come in and are super friendly.|`|SCiY5JESaa	never|`|EcdelIHtaa	nope

JnLoHaoAaa	Working at TGI Friday's, it all depends on the section you are in, which "cut" you are, and the business. Sometimes I can make a lot more on a weekday night than a weekend night. It just all depends. Also when you start there you are usually put in not so good sections and are first cut, meaning that your shifts aren't very long. They don't always hire people with experience. If you hustle, pick up shifts, show you're a hard worker and can do closing shifts, upsell, etc. You could make at least $100 on some weekday nights and $150 on a weekend night.|`|SCiY5JESaa	It all depends on your attitude , you can do the bare minimum and make  $30 on a friday night or you can go above and beyond and make $150 on a friday night or any night for that matter, suggestive selling ,  and getting them liquored up is always a plus, sell desserts make the bill high and kill em with kindness, by the way though you have to tip your bartender and your runners and your clearers thats the only downfall|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	It really depends on the location and how good you are.<br>  When I worked there I typically took home $200-300 a night on weekends. I know how to up-sell, I and very good at suggestive selling, I know how to read people and I know what exemplary service is.<br>  On week nights it varies depending on the day of the week.<br>  Now, that may be drastically changing due to the economy. I notice not so many folks are dining out these days.

i5MiFhMyaa	When it comes to food and animal treatment, Asians are ruthless, inhumane, and disgusting. If you would see the things that go on in China and South Korea it would sicken you.<br>  <br>  And herbal medicine stupidities, superstitions, and folklore are another reason why so many animals, many endangered, are needlessly slaughtered in Asia.|`|AA11993919	$1.25|`|EjjKZA1xaa	In India it cost $5.00 USD|`|XNaEyYqtaa	i dont know but i would pay 100 dollars to someone to do that :D
pbV7dnKKaa	Scottsdale is definitely a great place to live and has a good nighlife, there are a ton of Sports Bars there too. Look at an online yelow pages, you can see a list of bars that could be an option. I would just go and apply to as many as possible from there! Some places that are nice are Bar North or Joes Place both on Scottsdale Rd : >|`|djJNNgboaa	Probably Old Town Scottsdale would fit what you are looking for, there are a ton of busy bars there. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://recreationspotsaz.com/scottsdalerestaurants.html" rel="nofollow">http://recreationspotsaz.com/scottsdaler...</a>|`|LV61l5yAaa	good luck! finding a good bar tending or serving job here is very difficult right now.  You will need to get a maricopa county food handlers card.  Im not sure where you live but there is an office on baseline and alma school, where you can take the test and get the card.  You also need to be arizona liquor board certified.  Most restaurants and bars will provide you with the information you need to obtain this certifying.  You legally have up to 30 days after hire to produce these documents. Just remember that there is over a 20% unemployment rate here in the valley of the sun, so most places are not doing so well and its only going to get worse as summer comes.  Go high end, those Establishments are above the recession.  Peace and good luck!|`|3tZmTCbkaa	You can see the list at -<br>  <a href="http://www.zirana.com/AZ_scottsdale/bars_night_life/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zirana.com/AZ_scottsdale/bars...</a><br>  <br>  Call them to check salary / benefits etc.

ODvnyAdlaa	yes they are, x|`|8TmK8Qklaa	they were cooked in animal fat but now I think due to federal regulations they had to switch to something without trans fat.<br>  <br>  Chick Fila uses peanut oil for that specific reason, I suggest you go there if you want to avoid animal fat in your food.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	they're one of the only fast food restaurants that fries stuff in trans fat, so yes they do.|`|a31kUn1Naa	I am a vegetarian. And I don't eat there or any fast food place because of this idea. And you shouldn't either.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Edit: To people saying no. yeah it might not be chicken oil or whatever but they are cooking nuggets and stuff in the same oil. Which is gross.|`|JWk1lKJgaa	vegetable oil only. they used to add beef tallow but law suites put a stop to that practice. to my knowlege they never used chicken fat.|`|YnG0Tjxjaa	My friend worked there while she was vegan (hahahaha) and yes, they are indeed fried in chicken fat. However, Burger King does not do the same. If I were you, I'd go there.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	No their fries and everything else is cooked in what is basically vegetable oil. What you might be concerned with is the fact that chicken and some other items might be cook in the same oil as your fries. I would ask your local McDonald's about that if that might bother you.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Have you any idea how many chickens it would take to cook and remove the fat to fill their fryers EVERY DAY, no they are not cooked in chicken fat.|`|CTlkMN3Faa	Yes don't eat there if your a vegetarian, don't eat bojangles' biscuits either.|`|7618x2okaa	my old primary skool teacher used to work in mcdonalds and he says thye put all types of stuff in their food. but not sure if its true anymor coz they are getting healtier|`|RIySfkG5aa	seriously... no. My brother (however sad it sounds) worked there for a while.  its just vegetable oil. You're mother is right.  Eat away!!!|`|t6k3yoNdaa	Yeah they do. That's why McDonalds is one of the worst places to eat.|`|brSfRLspaa	they used to be cooked in beef lard but they stopped that cause of vegetarians|`|sGeQmBYaaa	Hunni...I work at McDonalds....we do nothing like that...they are just rumours.|`|xW4K0aK8aa	McDonalds do fry them in chicken fat becouse there fast food I know my mum works there
AA10629169	you can be employed at 14 but are only allowed to work4pm-9pm and keep a c average in school if you go lower you have to quit|`|BJ5XInjcaa	Alot of times you can start at 14, but more then likely they wont hire you until you are 16. Because you can't do as many things. Probably just the register or clean the lobby. And if they have enough people applying that are 16+ they will choose them instead because they are not as limited on what they can do. Good luck!!|`|lWD8f9veaa	I'm in Tacoma Washington and I was a GM for McDonalds... I had people who were 15 1/2 working for me.  They couldnt do anything near the fryers or the kitchen... basically hand out orders or take orders was all they could do.|`|Wm0jwLNnaa	Usually around the age of 16 but don't work there. Work at Burgerking|`|E9SfH7EYaa	16|`|KxH74NIHaa	46|`|ODvnyAdlaa	16 to be covered by their insurance x|`|vlCWp7sSaa	I live in Indiana. You can start working at 14 but you are also limited with what you can do. I also believe that you can't work over 25 hours a week. You will also need to provide a work permit from your school, they can easily deny this permit if your grades are bad. They can also call your work and ask that you are discharged from your position if your grades start going down.<br>  <br>  At the age of 16, you can work 35 hours a week but the work permit still applies. As long as you are a minor or have not graduated from Highschool.<br>  <br>  During the summer time or any break time from school, they are allowed to schedule you more hours.|`|H7HZXTaWaa	I think the standard age for employment anywehre in the country is 16.  I could be wrong, but I think legally hiring anyone younger violates child labor laws.|`|AA10790620	probably 16|`|Sx5HDgtpaa	I think it is around 16 or 17.|`|RikCftYKaa	i am pretty sure that you have to be 16 and have your work permit
BUOJJpaCaa	The McDoubles where I live don't have the weird sauce, but I was pissed too when I found out they only had one slice of cheese.<br>  <br>  It happened about 2 months ago where I live. I guess they are just trying to keep price down but cutting resources.|`|lWD8f9veaa	I know, they are getting cheap! and, they got rid of the spicy chicken that they just came out with... it reminded me of the Cajun and now its gone just like the Cajun!!!  McD pisses me off!|`|BJ5XInjcaa	Yeah they just did that, trying to cut costs|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	They'll still give you a double cheeseburger if you ask but it'll cost you $1.29<br>  <br>  That's weird about the sauce thing, maybe it was a mistake.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	only in the last couple of weeks they took the double cheese off the dollar menu and replaced it with that crap x
