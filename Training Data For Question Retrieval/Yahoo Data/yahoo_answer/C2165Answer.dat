54be9b6526936cef554d9a764ff83efcaa	Please forgive me if I'm covering something you have already created here (a Yard Sale) but I want to make sure I'm as thorough as possible with this answer.    1.  You need to open a Yard Sale.  To do so:  a.  Visit the hardware shop in downtown millsberry.  http://www.millsberry.com/shop.phtml?sho...  b.  Click on the "Add a Room" banner on the arch at the top of the screen http://www.millsberry.com/construction/  c.  Your existing house will be displayed as a grid.  Any rooms that have been built will show as having been built, empty rooms will show as blank.  Select the room in which you would like to build your yard (yards can be built on any unoccupied grid square on the first floor - if you wish to build on an occupied grid square you can do so but it will destroy the room that currently exists in that square).  d.  Select Yard as the room type and name your yard.  Once the build process has completed the new yard you just purchased will display on the grid of your home.  e.  Return to your home http://www.millsberry.com/home/ and click on the Yard Sale button below the front entrance to your house to activate your yard sale.  Once that has been activated your home should show a Yard Sale sign in front of it.    2.  Find the trophy you wish to sell and place it in your yard sale.  a.  Locate your trophy.  If it's a trophy that you have not placed in your house it's likely to be in your holding area http://www.millsberry.com/inventory.phtm... .  If you have already place the trophy in your house you must remove it before you can sell it.  Once it has been removed from the room it will return to your 'holding' area.  b.  After the trophy has been located click in the black Yard Sale sign button to the right hand side of the trophy.  A window willl pop up prompting you to type in the price you wish to charge for the trophy.  Type in the price you wish to charge and click OK and the trophy will be added to your yard sale automatically.|`|AA10349376	First you need a yard. Then you hold a yard sale and set a price for your trophy.|`|fac046bc8c7ddc70d39fe56618540d7aaa	There are some different steps you can do!    1. Have a yard sale!!! You will first need to buy a piece of Yard which you can buy at The hardware store ~~>http://www.millsberry.com/shop.phtml?sho... There you will see a sign that says "Add a room" click on that choose the room you want and the cost is 2.5k so make sure you have the money!!    2. Also you want to advertise you yard sale which can be done on the main page heres the link just incase you get a lil lost~~>http://www.millsberry.com/buy_ad.phtml there your yard sale will be where Everyone on Mills can see it!    3. Also on the message board on Mt (Millsberry tips) ~~> you can post your yard sale on the "Yardsale" message borads and there everyone on mt will  be able to come to your sale http://millsberryt1ps.proboards76.com/    4. You can send postcards to your friends on mills that say Come to my yard sale!!!!    Feel free to stop by my house my name is breannap4!!!

Any of those will do...or hey, do all of 'em!
AA10803498	When you are playing the game, underthe main menu you can go under the settings/options.  Look for an option that says something along the lines of "Controller Settings."  You can adjust the settings as well as see what your current ones are.    Also, to the other answerer, slashing is useing your stick to strike an opponent anywhere on his/her body or stick.        Best of luck with you game =)|`|40a198d77c9ee7b0e62a63be20b8743faa	Read the game manual. You can't randomly check. There are rules to hockey. I'm not sure what rule you are breaking but I believe slashing is hitting an opponent player in the legs. Not sure though.

Put the rubber band on your pinky, just above the first joint, and curl the pinky tightly against your palm.  Pull the other end of the rubber band around & behind your extended thumb, and pull the end out to your extended index finger and hook the rubber band on the tip of it.  Aim, release your pinky, and snap.  That's one dead dixie cup, or whatever you're shooting at.    Also, I discovered another method at work.  Take a wooden yardstick, hold it horizontally and hook a rubber band on the front end, as you stick the yardstick out away from yourself.  Brace the end of the yardstick on the front of your stomach/torso, as you steady the yardstick with one hand and pull the rubber band back with the other.  Aim carefully, and let fly.  This works well with the quarter-inch wide bands.  Using this method, you can shoot one of these rubber bands all the way across a standard-size Fedex Kinko's store.|`|54KKU6VPaa	take the rubber band, twist around a pencil a bunch of times until taut, then let it fly. it'll shoot in a circle.|`|AA11836753	Put it against a wall with a blindfold on--
SghFFOMraa	An ISO is an image of a CD.  You can burn this image to a CD and play it, or you can use software to "Mount" the ISO image (I recommend Daemon Tools).      To keep things simple mounting is basically tricking your computer into thinking it has an extra CD-ROM which actually loads the ISO file instead of a CD.    The easiest way is to burn the ISO to a CD.  Note that you choose the "burn ISO image" option because just copying the ISO file to a CD does not work.|`|f9f5eb7a2590ee5242a18dc42abeef7baa	download/install/run PowerISO.  there's an option in the program to create a virtual drive.  load the game's iso file into the virtual drive.  explore the contents using Windows Explorer and then you'll find the executable file to run the game.  good luck!|`|AA10009992	ISO format is a format you use to image compact disks and dvds, you need a program like nero to burn the software onto a disk to play it.|`|RqxaS4zlaa	An ISO Is an cd image copy. All you have to do is put it on a cd then just put it in one of your drives and play.     I'll put it this way - You wanna play a Full Game( the ones you have to buy) but you don't want to waste money. The CD w/ the ISO acts as the real actual disc.

If your box is stock and you do NOT go onto LIVE, you can replace the dvd drive with any DVD drive.    If you have a stock XBOX and you DO go on LIVE, you cannot replace your drive. The first time you logged onto LIVE, Microsoft made a permanent check of 3 things, your XBOX EEPROM, Hard Drive Serial  , and DVD Drive Serial  . If you change the HDD or DVD, when you log onto LIVE, it will note the different serial   and you will get banned. I've done it, and it sucks. I ended up modding my box and getting a new EEPROM.    Honestly, your best bet is just to get a new box, unless you were looking to mod...which I highly suggest.

AA11018420	I am not sure about the Jonas brothers, but about the time question...    Neopets is not like a DS game where you can change the time.  It is world wide and is in NEOPIAN time.  if you REALLY want to change to the next day the only thing you can do is to change your location.    go to  MY ACCOUNT > CONTROL PANEL > Modify Account Information     From there, you can change your location to like AFRICA.  It should be the next day there.  You may have to do a yahoo search for the postal service to find an actual zip code for the area you are atempting to change to.  but it would change the day and time.|`|VFa1crsfaa	I don't think the Jonas Brothers play neopets or do they?|`|b4JLDLtlaa	You play neopets cool.

9VjumSyfaa	You get the spade by doing some of the tasks that have been given to you either by the chef, or Ms. Weeder. Try to complete what they are asking for, and if I'm not mistaken, then you get the spade from Ms. Weeder. The spade is broken. You have to go to the crafting station to fix it.    You will find the bar for the crowbar after you fix the bridge. Once you cross the bridge, you will find the bar, and then take it to the crafting station and bend it.
4fdc882f19c55c701723d8d51fa1a8d7aa	Yeah its worth it.  I love it cause I don't have to go anywhere to rent them and they just come in the mail.  I never had any problems with them.  Blockbuster is ok but they don't have a big game selection cause they're main focus is movies.  Also, right now you can save yourself some money if you use this link http://www.gozipper.com/deals/gamefly.ph...  Then use the code: TENDAY    Hope this helps you out.  It will get you 10 days to try it out.    -Adrian|`|8d8rluLCaa	its worth it but they will up the monthly charge w/o your knowledge. other than that i have no complaints other than the availablility of new releases. try before you buy with the trial|`|AA11711532	i had it when it was $9.99 a month, and didn't care for it.  They don't have a big enough inventory so newer games are never available.  There shipping time takes a full week.  The only time i got a game in 2-3 days was for a replacement copy ( game i got was scratched and wouldn't play).   Go to blockbuster or something like that, its much less hassle.      When they did raise the price they didn't even tell me. No e-mail or nothing, just saw it on my credit card bill!!

y0Ni4nfmaa	Si lo que buscas es mejor rendimiento y posees el dinero suficiente un ps3 seria lo adecuado, ya que posee un procesador mas potente que el del 360,  lector de blue ray, se puede jugar hasta de 6 personas, pero su defecto esta en la escacez de titulos del momento, como GEARS OF WAR, HALO 3, entre otros, yo diria que es mejor el 360 por que tiene mas aplicaciones, ya que es de microsoft, ya que posee msn, y tiene un motor online multijugador mas potente que el de ps3,por lo que es muy agradable estar conectado hablando con tus amigos mientras juegas, ademas de que es mas economico y hay una gran variedad de titulos para esta consola.|`|4vBVFW3Faa	tu que crees esta mas perro el playtation 3 el XBOX 360 ni le llega al playtation 3 la neta si fuera tu el playtation 3 obio|`|RMZx3txZaa	Sin duda la PS3, porque?? ahi te van sus principales caracteristicas:     Tiene lector blue-ray (asi que podras ver peliculas en alta definicion, y en mi opinion muy superior a los discos HD), nuevo CPU CELL, y su control que tiene deteccion de movimiento (muy parecido al Wii pero diferente) y lo mas sobresaliente sus puertos HDMI, puedes alcanzar a ver resoluciones de hasta 1080 p!!!     Algunos diran que la Xbox360 ya tiene tambien su puerto HDMI (que por cierto solo esta de adorno), pero sus juegos no alcanzan a llegar a la resoluciones que llega la PS3, y porque no llegan? por su pobre lector de DVD... por la poca capidad de almacenamiento de los DVD no pueden llegar a esas resoluciones, y una BLUE RAY llega a almacenar hasta unos 25 GB de datos por capa, 50 GB a doble capa...algo que un DVD no llegara a tener...  Asi que en una pantalla de alta definicion se vera mejor la PS3 que una Xbox360...    En cuanto a los juegos...siempre dicen que la xbox360 tiene mejores juegos, y cuales son esos juegos?? me daran toda una lista de juegos buenos..pero en algo coinciden todos esos juegos, TODOS son SHOOTERS!!! nose si para ti es variedad, pero para mi no...    Y algo sorprendente que puede llegar a hacer la PS3, es tener un sistema operativo LINUX y de hecho hasta el windows!    Otra cosa por la que es mejor la PS3...Playstation Network (algo parecido a Xbox live) solo que es gratuito...    Hasta la fecha no e visto problemas con mi PS3 y ni e visto que los tengan otras personas que poseen la PS3...pero la Xbox360 salio con defecto de las TRES LUCES ROJAS, hasta la XBOX360 ELITE aun posee ese problema....    Asi que esa es mi opinion de que consola es mejor...xD!!!|`|R8Dq5gnwaa	el playstation 3|`|NLFOhFA5aa	ps3 tiene mucha mas potencia|`|b7lEcU2maa	playstation 3 xk es la ke mas se aproxima al futuro no muy lejano.|`|SNUR6Bo8aa	Nada que, el Wii se las esta pwneando analmente en ventas a las dos juntitas con todo y blu ray y xbox live ;)|`|jMHtBX0laa	Yo voy por el ps3, le veo mejores graficos y en las pantalla plana Bravia se ve alucinante XD ojala te sirva    Saludoss|`|lOCYWYnAaa	Yo voy por el ps3 veo unos graficos de lo mejor y como a mi me gustan los juegos de resident evil en ps3 esta el resi 5    saludos|`|Tu322XoEaa	es ovio q el ps3 es mas padre con su dise?o y cosas buenas q tiene      suerte!!!|`|jSeUmNpRaa	la xbox 360 por que tiene mas jugos mas juabilidad y si la tienes pirateada como yo nunca te aburres|`|AA11710981	360 Obviously.

QWbAkYEOaa	Very easy answer. As he swings the ball, hide in the corner under the platform. After he swings to the side you are on and the ball is moving back, jump on the platform jump over and hit him, jump right back under the platform and start again. It takes 7 hits to kill him.|`|he7OIpruaa	When the guy (dr. eggman) swings the bobm on the the side you are not on you jump on his machine. Do this about 4 or 5 times and you should win.       P.S.

Xm5ab6F6aa	As you know the business started in the late 20's, there is not just one book I use a series of books from catalog reprints to hard back volumes in Madame Alexander Dolls. I like the catalog because they spell out all of the extras and the different dresses and extras for different years but they only start in the 1940's and some of the early years are missing.   For the later dolls I use the series of Madame Alexander collector Guides for pricing by Linda Crowsey. You can double check on some of the online references, but personally for what I do I need the books for more information.    http://www.dollreference.com/index.html    I buy my books on Addall books .com great used books    http://used.addall.com    They do have a section with lots more links.
Xm5ab6F6aa	You are going to need some very good reference, and to study the history of papier mache  dolls. The Blue Book on the value of Dolls does not recommend altering these dolls which that will devalue the doll. I am not sure which one you have. They are some of the earliest of all dolls before they even made china dolls. Kestner starting selling papier mache around 1824, they are hard to find because they were eaten by vemits. If you have a Grinner which is American or wax overs. Many have gesso faces, shelled faces.     The Chinese made them in 1200's    You can not use anything wet, only remove the wig if its plastic. Most wigs come off with water, so if you plug the wig you may make a hole. You can use a very soft eraser or a special dry sponge.     If its a wax over then its a different method of cleaning.    I have always used "The Handbook of Doll Repair and Restoration" by Marty Westfall It should be available in paper back too.  and Is available on http://used.addall.com/    Maybe you can post a picture of your doll so she she can be id and I give you a better answer. Also I can give you a doll repair person in your area.  
Xm5ab6F6aa	Do you have the item or did you just have an ad or picture. I have dealt in dolls for almost 20 years now, and the company that owned the Shirley Temple trade mark for dolls was Idea and later after 70's another company picked up.     Danbury Mint and one other that made a plastic shirley with no curls in the back. But she never had a hat with an outfit because of the 21 curls on the shirley head. Patsy from Effanbee in the 30;s had a hat. Sometimes the molds from the Idea company went to Canda to Regal doll company and they made the dolls there. But Molly Goldburger was the designer of the doll clothes for Ideal and later she opened a company called Molly's which made some great dolls. Does the ad have a date that would be helpful. let me know

Se cerchi un buon simulatore di guerra, non posso che consigliarti operation flashpoint.  un titolo molto anziano che potrebbe non gratificarti dal punto di vista grafico, ma che  al top per la simulazione. a breve dovrebbe uscire il seguito Operation Flashpoint 2 (anche se il vero e proprio seguito sarebbe Arma 2, ma sono entrambi titoli molto validi).  Se desideri uno sparatutto ambientato ai nostri tempi, non puoi non giocare a Call of Duty modern warfare. ti consiglio Splinter Cell per quanto riguarda i titoli d'azione.   Se desideri uno sparatutto che i faccia gelare anche il sangue, non devi perderti FEAR. Fa veramente paura! Le sessioni da sparatutto sono ottime, ottima intelligenza artificiale e una grafica al top.

King - Can move in any direction once, but cannot go on a space if he will be in a check position!|`|hMkb7H31aa	Please clarify.  Are you asking for the notation of the movement of a chess piece on the board?|`|sKCwYP6Zaa	The move is called Castling    When neither your King or Rook has moved for the game, and the space between them is clear of other pieces, then you can move ur king two spaces toward your rook and place ur rook on the other side of ur king. You cannot make this move into, out of, or through Check.|`|gumyzjiiaa	Sample moves:  any pawn can move 1 square straight forward. It a piece is in the way then the pawn cannot move (called blocking piece).     ONLY in the first move can a pawn move 2 squares at once (if the squares in front of it are free). After the first move all pawns only move one at a time.     NOW, if a pawn tries to move two squares (first move) and there is another pawn to the right or left that pawn can decide if "he" agrees and let go (let the two moves go) or if he will not allow the two moves, and therefore will capture the pawn as though it had made one move only. This condition is called "en passant" (french word for "in passing"). If the enemy pawn "decides" he does not want to allow two jumps, he captures. This rule is to prevent players from move two squares with a pawn just to avoid capture.     Important: if you do not capture "en passant" right away then you cannot do it later (after you made your move).|`|d0YiyKZ7aa	the library has many books about chess.|`|AA10566329	go to www.uschess.org and click on new to chess
wHCgSJCaaa	I'm going to assume you're using Windows XP. If you're using Vista, what I say here probably isn't going to be much of a help.    There are types of solitare which came with Windows XP. They are 'Solitare' and 'New Solitare'.    They are both located in the Windows/System32 folder. Named Sol and Spider (Spider is the new solitaire).    These two games along with minesweeper can usually be accessed through the shortcut in the Start Menu. But since for you, the shortcuts disappeared, you can use other methods to open those games.    The easier method is by using the Run window. (You can open the Run window by going to Startmenu->Run or pressing the Startmenu key button on the keyboard and simultaneously pressing 'R'.)    In the run window, type in 'sol' or 'spider' without the quotations then hit enter. The game should pop up.     If you think this method is inconvenient, you can go into the Windows/System32 folder and copy and paste the shortcuts of Sol.exe or Spider.exe to the desktop for easier access. Not recommended unless you know what you are doing.    -Chao =] hope it works.|`|3d1a3c4a191ed64a8f94a10e834bb850aa	Well, hello, Dolly.  Here's what you do, Dolly.

CR3q3zbdaa	if it is Amazon itself that is shipping out the game (in which this case it is) with pre orders, it is normally shipped out the day before (in this case it should be shipped Monday the 9th) and you should get it within 2-4 days typically.     I have yet to have something take the full 5 days yet.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	It'll take 4-5 business days after the release date (which isn't until February 10).  So expect it Monday the 16th or Tuesday the 17th.    While I can't guarantee this because I don't work for Amazon, unless you live in the middle of nowhere or your post office is extremely slow, you'll probably get it right on time or a little early.

oIz9HYaraa	Thats odd... Ive used Visa's before, and Master Cards still work.    I have had more recent problems with prepaid visa on other online vendors though. I think maybe Visa's getting pretty stingy with what they do. They already have their money, so I guess they dont really care.    Its not really upto Visa where your money goes. Its upto you. I'd call them back and complain as well as file a complaint with the BBB.    Someone in december reported a vanilla visa working, which is a type of prepaid visa.

Swmd0P2uaa	xbox 360 definently!     Pros-Online with the 360:  Downloadable Movies, Tv shows, Music Videos, Game videos, Demos, Live Arcade,Game add-ons, player reputation, achievements, ability to play music while playing online, or offline. Windows media center compatable, for streaming music/video (if you can't fit it on your harddrive), Xbox Live Vision The best part of course is streaming NETFLIX through your xbox. Also, you can buy rechargable battery pack for your controllers.    The cons:    When 360 launched, the failure rate due to overheating was above 20% (high) HOWEVER! the warrenties were extended to 3 years. And the failure rate has taken a STEEP drop since its launch. I keep mine completley off the ground-away from carpet. I put it ontop of a plastic grid with holes and no problems yet!  (oh yeah, be sure you lay it flat, everyone stands it verticle and wonders why it breaks..)    And of course, you cant beat the games! There are soo many more games (with high ratings) for the 360, as opossed to ps3.     Playstation:  Pros- It looks nice. Has a pretty big hard drive, and unlike 360 you dont need batteries for your controllers, you hook them up to the console when you arent playing. There are also a few cool add ons PS3 has, like blue ray player, and Play station eye camera.     Cons- There are not as many games for Ps3. Sony said recently that they are working on that, and hope to release a lot of exciting new games in the coming months. (I dont know how soon) They also have a reputation for bad online service, which they say they are also planning to fix.|`|e9695c75152e6d757a83f3e1f8134384aa	xbox 360 is better.

AA10558731	I'm 51 and have been playing video games since my dad brought home a Pong game way back when. I played Dungeons & Dragons when I was a boy as well, and remember thinking how great that game would be if it was computerized ~ and now it is (along with about a million other RPGs)    I've tried WoW but my wife & I both prefer & enjoy City of Heroes (though I had to practically force her to try it she's totally addicted now) and I have about a half dozen other games on my desktop that I play as well, and a PS2 I fire up from time to time.    Not sure who's saying "go outside" but it ain't me! There's bugs out there. And it's cold. Or hot. Not to mention poison ivy, lol! Computer games are great, keep on playing and ignore those who would prefer you do something that makes them happy. It's your life, not theirs.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	more and more people play them, they are no longer "kids" games    The average age of an Everquest2 player is 31  and we work and play games to relax    I see nothing wrong with it.  It doesn't stop me from enjoying life, it's just anouther aspect of it|`|4BoteYDwaa	I'm not judging, but my room mate and I were like night and day. He wanted to stay inside and play World of War Craft all the time, and I couldn't stand sitting in one spot for so long. I think the difference is a matter of priorities. Some people want to play games all day and night until their blue in the face, and others just want others to get out and do something. I personally could not just sit and stare at a screen all day while my life passes me by, there's so much I'd rather be doing. I feel like people have the right to do what they want. I feel like when someones old enough to earn the money to pay for their hobbies, they're old enough to enjoy'em.|`|3IO4zCbUaa	people assuming being outside means you're doing something productive. do what makes you happy.|`|edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	i did play wow i have a 75 warrior, but now i found fable II and scroll of oblivion for xbox 360. everyone says that because they look at as ur sitting around doing nothing with ur life. I look at it this way playing video games is better than drinking all the time. Cause lets me honest they pretty much all people do. WOW can be harmless but some people take it way to seriously like the kid that played 20 straight hrs and then fell over. Don't take it to hurt I'm hooking up xbox live soon and once i get it I'm probably going to be inside most of the time.|`|ieCuJVZtaa	People who says these things to you are from a generation who played outside, and an age group of people that has become almost neurotically aware of the number of health problems they are suffering from or are going to suffer from in years to come (given the spectacular advancements in nutrition and understanding the medical benefits of exercise within the past 20 years, that generation now knows what they did not before, and want to do whatever they can to help the generations after them... by pestering the **** out of them). These health problems arise for any number of reasons-- and one of them is from being a (perceived) "couch potato". Parents/friends/doctors don't want their kids or people sitting in front of their TVs and computer games all day, that much is obvious. When people pester you about these things, just remember its because they care.    With that said, it IS your choice to play computer games. I played the frustratingly hard grind that is Lineage 2 a number of years ago, and I know how emotionally and socially engrossing it can be; I was definitely living a fantasy that was about as tangible as it could get, AND playing with people who enjoyed it as much as I did, if not more. Although in the end I stopped playing to focus on school and education, I do not find it unreasonable at all that people enjoy gaming. Just make sure you keep healthy when you're doing it (see your doctors often, too) and make sure gaming doesn't create any other problems in your life (financially, socially, etc).    with that said, lvl 71 ES on Gustin :)|`|CotWcTI0aa	I never thought of it that way.  Haha! Get skin cancer?  And I am like that too... I'm a computer person. But... I don't know. Part of it is because you need sunlight and exercise. And, you're not living a very real life (virtual instead), but yeah, so what if you're not? Maybe, like someone said, you need to do something productive, either for you (work, school, friends) or for others (helping the world somehow). But it's not like we don't have time for that. Maybe because there are also many things out there to enjoy. I don't know, man. I can't answer this exactly, but I just wanted to express my opinion as well.    Have a nice (real and virtual) life!!

Just like you probably think the people that are out there wasting away and getting cancer at the beach isn't a great way to spend your time, they think gaming isn't a good way to spend their time.    Personally, I'm a gamer, and I don't care what people think. When I was a teenager my parents were always bugging me saying I shouldn't play video games, it's a waste of time "blah blah blah". I didn't care. I really think people assume gamers are all large, gross people with no friends. I have no idea where this idea came from, but I hear it a lot (especially being a girl gamer). Little do they know that I am not fat at all, I'm actually a dancer and a personal trainer in great shape. Haha.    But now that I'm 22 people still think it's weird that I game, but again, I go to University, I live with my boyfriend, I'm making a life with myself, but I enjoy gaming. I find it's a good way to relieve stress and have fun. I don't care to go to the bar and get drunk and act stupid, but that's my opinion.    Gamers will be gamers, just ignore the people that say negative things. It shouldn't bother you.|`|BPKoxVMZaa	i agree i mean im only 12 and i love playing computer games like sims, spore, oblivien a lill bit of far cry, my bro,dad (who both like computers) and mum r always saying stuff like stop playing that stupid(sims) game or stop playing games and do something useful u say u want 2 do this ___ so stop playing games and teach ur self! ect.

AA11809468	Nobody knows for sure, but the closest thing is Left 4 Dead. It's a new online/offline game from Valve (The creators of Half-Life and Counterstrike) and this game's awesome! It has about the same concept like CS but instead of playing as counters and terrorists, you play one of four survivors from a zombie massacre.    I know, it sounds really silly at first but believe me it's not. Left 4 Dead is really addictive and you can play with your friends online as either the survivor or the zombie. It's really cool!    This game might interest you while waiting for a new CS game. Check it out!|`|3LPTLUczaa	Eventually, but why would you want one? 1.6/source both have thousands of servers and players still. Source had over 100,000 players at one time just yesterday.     It may be released at the same time as episode 3 but I wouldn't hold my breathe especially as there has been no news of episode 3 yet and Vavle are busy with TF2, L4D, Episode 3 and Portal 2 atm.    BTW the poster above me is a moron, Counter Strike is not "going down" - it has more users now than ever before.|`|mEpk7cQ0aa	counter strike is going down it is a better multiplayer game LEFT 4 DEAD  is a excelent game download it and play(enjoy)|`|Bw3C2Gk7aa	Perhaps not in the new future.  I have not heard of any news about the new counter strike and I see no reason for Valve to release one soon.    CS:S is still a popular game and it is still being played by thousands of people worldwide so there is no reason for Valve to release a new one.    The game's Source engine still holds up well today!

BjpZ017Saa	My opinion is that a ps3 is the best choice because of quality and quantity of games available. The main thing going for the 360 is halo and you already mentioned you dont like halo. Other than mass multiplayer games, the 360 does not have much to offer. The ps3 has a built in blue-ray player, which ads to its value. Also, the ps3 is slowly becoming the more popular console if you follow the sales records which means that more games will be available in the future, not to mention that im 99 percent sure you can play all ps and ps2 games with a ps3. (there are endless amounts of games).|`|LnYr2dLfaa	For online: 360    For offline: PS3|`|fEeEP7vYaa	Okay depends on what u are interested in.  More people play on the 360 than the playstation 3.  but personally i like the 360 experience of online better than Ps3.  that's if u looking at games.    Then that's definitely the way to go.  Quality for the 360 is pretty good just make sure its 1080i HD.  Games are great on the 360 (in my opinion) Halo 2 and 3,left 4 dead, Fable 2, Gears of War 1 and 2  Madden 09, NBA 2k9, GTA, CoD4, and CoD world at war (u can also play those on the Ps3 as well but better to play on the 360, much better online) its goes on.    Ps3 is Awesome i like it alot.  but the down side. Games are not all as fun as of playing on the 360.  online on the Ps3 is Crap compared to 360. Games for the Ps3 are okkayyy... not Great. would rather play on 360.  But some of the best games for the Ps3 is God of War (Thats probably one of the funnest games i have ever played).  Besides all that im going to be honest, i only use the Ps3 for the Blue-Ray now.    But The positve side i love the blue-ray system in the console it was the best thing they did to it.  Online is free. It may not be the best Gaming experience but its free.  Quality of the picture is amazing. Much better than the 360.      But it all comes down to what type of games you plan on playing.  So its really up to you.  Id go with the 360 (as you can tell).     Hope this helps :)|`|9CYLUovjaa	get the 360 it has way Better games than the ps3 Better everything. come on man  how could you not like halo 3 or gears of war maybe your not a real gamer|`|sJpTRoTpaa	I agree that PS3 is the best choice 4 u.. B-cause many good games are for PS3.. Long live Sony!! ^^|`|SXAKdZX8aa	Well I say xbox 360.  But that is only 1 opinion...|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	get a 360

AA10206911	I like Digimon World 2 very much  It has a nice story  too much missions that you must do  too much digimon that you can catch  I dont know the game that you mentioned but   maybe Digimon World 2 is so old but I do Like it    By the way If anyone knows this game please help me with that question  PLEASE:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|c3tc7Evfaa	thats what i wanna find out too  digimon is my all time fav. show :)  yep obviousily there woudnt be teh same game still cause it was years ago but the only other thing i can suggest is to get the digimon games for nintendo ds if you have a ds :)  any other questions feel free to ask at random_cass@yahoo.com

3d85b3424264ace71a203ac1b8f6abe7aa	The PSP is way better HANDS DOWN......you can do soo much things to it if you hack it.  You can play SNES, SEGA, PS1, and GBA  games.  You can browse the internet....There's even a digital camera out for it called the CHOTTO shot.  It's pretty neat and it now has GPS which is cool if you get lost a lot, like me, and then later you'll be able to make calls with the camera thru a SKYPE network.......NOT bad!!!  I never leave without it.|`|EN8ojMpPaa	i guess it depends if you want good graphics,video,photo and music  also wireless internet then go for PSP    if u want touchscreen, mario games most of final fantasy games and you dont mind the graphics then DS|`|4nROh3yOaa	Personally i think PSPs are very underrated, they have graphics in between ps1 and ps2, and have many decent games, one of the best being the monster hunter games. they also work as an mp3 player movie player and internet browser!|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	Personally i like the DS, although i never had a PSP.  DS games are just a heck of alot cheaper =P|`|HMUfksYmaa	If you ask me, psp. Psp just has much better graphics plus you can download and you dont have to pay. Nintendo DS is much complicated because you have to buy a R4 or DSTT, psp on the other hand u just gotta hack.|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	It may be easier to use homebrew on a DS, But It's not cheap.  PSP is Much better.  Hacking my PSP was Free.  Plus there is more WORKING homebrew for the PSP.  Better Screen,  better games,   MP3 Player. (Moonshell for DS sucks!)  Video player,  Much sexier than the DS.  Very Customizable.  No Dumb touch Screen.

Npi4QR7Maa	If you've played Metal Gear Solid series than get MGS4. That is hands down the BEST GAME OF ALL TIME in my opinion.    But, its only if you've played the other games, if not you're not gonna know whats going on.    Other than that,    Grand Theft Auto IV  Dead Space  Fallout 3  The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion-game of the year edition  Soul Calibur IV  Devil May Cry IV|`|chrz5L6zaa	if ur into shooters try quake wars its da bomb|`|7fseqzNnaa	o_o dude if you want the best cut scenes and online game for the ps3 get Metal Gear Solid 4 try out grand theft auto 4 or little big planet call of duty 4 modern warfare those are all good games for the ps3
gF26JyzBaa	s it ok to have the same account name and PSN ID? they are the same.  Does my PSN ID only work for my account name, not anyone else's? yes, apart from sub accounts you can set up if you wish, but there's no point unless you have kids.    Do trophies add on the accnt. name or PSN ID? yea, as long as you hit triangle on the trophy icon and synch them to the psn.

AA11988671	Well you can't get higher than 100% efficiency, but you can use spell stacking to do more than 100% damage.  I'm a level 14 battlemage with under 200 magic and I can wipe out a room of enemies with 3 spells.    1. I created a custom spell that is 100% weakness to frost, 100% weakness to magic, 12 foot range for 5 seconds.  2. Created another identical spell, WITH A DIFFERENT NAME.  3. Created a frost damage 5 points for 10 seconds with soul trap with 12 foot range.    If you can cast 1,2,3 within 5 seconds you do a ton of damage.  When I tested this the first time I went to a stable, pushed 5 horses together and was amazed when they all fell over ;)  This is with no cheats and no mods, the only mod I use is the skill diary.    Oh, you can cast faster if you are blocking so that helps when trying to pull this off...|`|nxh8xxQvaa	unfortunatly... No, to both questions. But, if you give your character enough enchantments, they should be pretty impervious to most things. Hope this helps.
AA12328571	yeah it is against the tos but would be interesting to know how much your character would be worth with the amount of hours you put into it, i've heard rumours that some people have sold their toons like yours from $50.00 right up to $2000.00|`|a8tsrTCbaa	It is worth nothing and selling or attempting to sell anything from WoW is a violation of the TOS. So, if you get caught you will have nothing, and you would have to be a fool to pay for someones account because you could end up with nothing.
lhmsAlQuaa	here is what i found under Google  Just click under games on the top where you see those mini bars (tabs)
4He3bNO7aa	Oh Nick S - what a sad little person you are. You obviously have no idea what Second Life is about AND have no life, so you take the short route and poke fun and someone else in the hope that people will poke fun at then instead of you for being the real loser who has nothing better to do than scour Yahoo Answers looking for people to mock. And who made you the arbitter of what is sensible or loser behaviour anyway? :))    But to the question ...  The newbie guide for SL is to relax and see where it leads you. Because there is no set plan to SL, you end up doing whatever you want. It takes some time to understand how SL works and what you can do. A big mistake a lot of people make is to think they have to get a job in SL, otherwise they are not going to have any fun. Finding a job is hard because so many people think they have to do that. People who employ you want you to have some experience of SL and be sure you're not going to just disappear.    My advice is to explore places and to make at least one friend who is as new as you are. Sharing your amazement and frustrations is better than just wandering around on your own. You will learn things together.    Try going to a few places with free things. Here's a short (but by no means complete) list. Just use Search - ALL and enter the names of these place,s then use the Teleport link to go there.    ICING: Three nice dresses for free in a wardrobe at the back of the store opposite the entrance. Right click on each dress and select the Buy/Pay option. Buy each dress for L$0.    MAITREYA: Near the arrival area you will see a sign to join the Maitreya group. Click on it and you will get a box with 15 pairs of shoes. You will have to find an area where you can drag the item from your Objects folder in your inventory to the ground. Then right click on the bag you see and select Open. You get a window showing you the items. When you see them all, click on the 'Copy To Inventory' button. After all the items have transferred to your inventory, right click on the bag again, click on 'More' and then 'Delete'.    GURL6: Big place. Go up the ramp, turn left and walk along a little way. On the wall you will see a poster saying 'New Hair for Newbies'. Click on that and you get a folder in your inventory. Read the instructions on the notecard in that folder; choose a hairstyle: fill out the other notecard in the folder and send it to the owner of GurL6 - Six Kennedy. Within a day she will send you the free hair of your choice.    FLEUR: Walk through the main door and turn right and walk along to the wall. You will see a poster with free skins for players under 30 days old. As before, right click on the poster, pay L$0 and get a pack of nice skins.    NICKY REE: Walk into the store and turn right. on the right wall a little way along are a whole bunch of items for free. Buy each for L$0.    BELEZZA: Walk into the store and turn immediately left. Walk to the wall and you will see two boxes - male gift and female gift. Look above you and you will see a sign to join the Belezza group. Click on the sign then at the bottom of your screen, click on Local Chat. You will see a link akin to a webpage link. Click on it. This opens up the Belezza group window. Click on 'join'. You will now have the Belezza group tag over your head. Click on the Female Gift box to get a really high quality skin for free.    MUSE FINE JEWELLERY: Walk into the store and you will see two walls in the centre of the building. On the back of one of these is a sign with 4 pearldrop necklaces for free. Buy as before.    LEAGUE: Another group sign to click on. This time you get a pair of shiny gold pants. Inside the store is a box containing a fabulous pair of high-heel boots for free as well.    There are lots of places with free goodies like this. Until you decide if SL is for you and you want to spend money on clothes, these will keep you going.    OK, so next you need somewhere to go in your nice clothes. Open search again and then click on events. chose the music sub category and look for an event that is to your musical taste. Note the time the event starts and go there at that time. Note that times are SL times, so you will need to adjust to your own time.    Just keep exploring and keep making friends. If some people are rude, ignore them and talk to someone else. Ask questions of people and never think of yourself as a useless newbie who knows nothing, because everyone in SL started out knowing nothing and had to learn.    Most of all have fun with it and don't rush to be a financial tycoon. Jobs - the right ones - will present themselves to you as your friends list grows.|`|M9vBKfh7aa	Very simple. You need to stand up, go to your nearest megaphone , walk to your window. Open it.. Then scream to the world that you are a loser with no life sO you had to play this game.
iUWLZowFaa	1) From the start continue through the level until you're outside. Grab a vehicle and kill the enemies such as the grunts and other small enemies.  DO NOT DESTROY BOTH WRAITHS.  Destroying or kicking the driver out of the purple wraith will cause the skull to disappear.  Best way to do it, take out the one with the Flak Cannon batteries atop the one on the ground. Then go to the top right corner on the plains where there is some sort of small silo tower. The Skull is sitting on top. To get to the skull: Grenade jump up, or if that doesnt get you high enough park a vehicle by it and use that for extra lift. This needs to be done near the front of the building.  (To grenade jump, face where you want to go, then throw a grenade just in front of your feet, then run and jump towards your desired location.  Be sure to duck down near the peak of your jump to get that last little bit of height. The explosion beneath will give you extra lift and hopefully not kill you!)    2) An even easier way to get on top of this silo is to follow the instructions as above and destroy the wraith with the flak cannon batteries on top **the orange wraith**. once this wraith blows up it will drop a deployable cover, deploy this as close to the front of the silo and use it as a step to jump up.|`|9e4ac0e2f225b1c69ed1f6d14c9e1d09aa	i will help get 4 you SEND ME FRIEND REQUEST GT DEVILMANH8U|`|YweJ1PfUaa	you have to do it before you destroy the anti-air wraiths(the ones you cant board)

vsQBW5jaaa	People are always looking for retro games like this, You'll even get a profit. Start bidding at around a tenner and you should build a nice little profit!    Or sell them on amazon, amazon you put a fixed price and wot move but will get sold whereas eBay will go up but may not sell in the time, so its all about you will risk it for a biscuit! :P|`|7tOhpKQYaa	Pokemon Cards. You will get a nice profit. If you got rares you got heaps of profit.   Well, eBay is a big thing. Amozon is pretty good.  Any friends. If you have any friends of people that you know that want you cards you might get a huge profit. If it's your friend don't do this but if it's just this ramdom kid you nkow then do it. Make it a big ripoff unless they know. If it's like a good card then say it doesn't seel anymore. Liek thewy don't print those cards anymore.    ( Can i have 10points)

itnNdUo8aa	The original and the third game are the best in my opinion.  It really depends on what you prefer.  Original tony hawk for dreamcast is the best in the series in my opinion.
P3m3Ri8maa	Full rune amour set has the defence stats around +200 for cursh, stab ect  Where as black has a little under 100+ (i think)    Allthough Black trimmed amour does look better, the defence stats are terrible. and the looks do not compensate for the lack of deffence.    So for virtually everything (Exept showing off) Pick the rune amour set.    ~Sammo9999~ My runescape account, level 111  ~The RuneScape Guy~|`|1aagL3uvaa	Go with Rune.  Black trim is exactly the same as regular Black armour, it just looks heaps cooler than normal Black, or Rune for that matter.  If you're going for looks I recommend the trim, but for stats go with the full Rune|`|FhRHWEbpaa	rune...    number 2 in other words...|`|jUjkvis8aa	Obviously rune. Black trimmed has the same stats as normal black armour.     x|`|MuRS4lo6aa	rune cus black t just has same deffence as normal black and rune has 40 deffence|`|85a7adb7410df3ce980f02b34377f6edaa	number 2    its stronger and can take blows|`|f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	Black trimmed armor is exactly as good as black armor - which is to say, not very good at all. Rune is way better.    The black trimmed stuff does look nicer and is rarer, but that's all it really has going for it.

And SL is only boring if you have no imagination or need everything doing for you.|`|xqOWI8VUaa	U can choose which one u want i think (not sure i played it ages ago, it was more boring than watching dog poo dry). But i know for sure it is third person.|`|q3qbk99Raa	theres a ton to do in SL, you can fight in combat sims with swords and guns and wear cool clothes and such. the place to get cool weapons is Jinxxed Studios or GamersBrand. they both have affordable wepons.    you can also go to clubs, have races, dance, fly around or planes and airships. anything you can do in real life you can do in SL and more. you can be a motorcyle riding pirate or even a polar bear with a dress and hook for an arm. everything in the game is made by people.    theres a site you can use called metaRL that lets you earn free lindens. you just play games, take surveys, enter contests and refer people to the site for points. then you trade in the points and you get free lindens (money used in SL)

7qou0sdFaa	The Old Republic is an MMO, so even though it takes place in the same time period it's story is going to be somewhat constrained by the format (there can't be thousands of jedi who've lost their memories running around). From what I've read you chose a faction, either Sith or Republic, and within that faction you can choose to be good or evil. Bioware is promising a more in depth story than experienced in most mmos, if they can deliver on that promise it should be good.     You can sign up for the newsletter on the old republic website. Check out the video, the game play doesn't look like anything special at the moment but it's interesting what the developers have to say about what they want for the game.|`|X6WAOqZOaa	No the next old republic is an mmo and won't be out till winter this year or sometime next year.  Most MMO games require you to pay to play.|`|XJDiSgbuaa	the new mmo swtor game takes place in the same time line but it is 100 yrs after kotor2 . so theres probably no ebonhawk and malik is long dead and the sith he created is flourishing|`|kqiZfrXkaa	100 years after 2 but developers say its 3-10 in story, gameplay, and time.

He shouldn't care about who his Ex-GF is sleeping with, because she is EX.|`|AA10510616	If he got mad because he did not want his ex around it would be okay but,if he got mad cause he could no longer hang with his friend that would be ok but,for any other reason I would feel he may be mad bout her being with some else and that would tick me off.|`|fd7dad4940240637e17c145865ab342caa	Ok, he gets mad at his bestfriend for sleeping with his ex.  If it's his ex, and he loves you and is dating you, there has to be a reason he chose you and not her.  If they slept together during their relationship then he has a right to be mad at her, but if they ended the relationship and THEN they slept together, then it would depend on the amount of time between the break-up and the sleeping together.  Like if it was a few weeks, then he still has the right to be mad, but if it was like more than 3 months, then he really has no reason to be mad.  On the topic of you getting mad at him, i would say no.  I mean, it's not like he did anything except be concerned for the stability of his friendship with both people.  If it didn't change his feeling about you, then there's really nothing to be worried about.  I'm sure he would be pretty freaked out by the situation, and like most men, need to take out his feelings on someone.  He probably got mad at her because she may have just jeopardized his relationship with his bestfriend.  In my opinion, i would say no, he didn't really do anything so therefore you have no reason to be mad at him.

You just plug your ethernet cable into the back of your 360 and then plug it into your modem.    You can connect it to your pc but you need something else for that.  If you want to go with another option, everything you need to know is in your manual.  Have you just bought your 360,?  Do you know all about your membership?

You can also purchase the wireless adapter that connects on the back and connect your 360 to a wireless network.  A wireless router connected to the internet would be required in this case.    In either of these two scenarios you will need a broadband connection to the internet via cable modem or DSL.

acaSsvaUaa	Spiderman 3 is an okay game.  I rented it and beat it within three days.  There were things that I liked as well as things I disliked.  I liked how they added the criminal gangs attempting to take control of New York but I disliked the fact that you could fail the mission a scant few seconds after getting a new objective.  I liked how you were no longer thrown a great distance away whenever you were struck by an attack unlike in the previous game.  I liked the addition of photography mode allowing for you to actually feel like Peter Parker but I didn't like how even if you got an exact shot of the criminal you might not be credited for it.    Is it worth the $40.00 price tag?  If you are a Spiderman fan, then you will like it.  Personally, I would recommend waiting till it drops in price if you plan on buying it.  There are several better games you could spend $40.00 on that would be a lot more enjoyable.|`|ee8e8c18fa17d461a824ec2f91d835b7aa	I have the game and it is not as I expected...If you just want to past the time away Its OK|`|735e2fc193819b40fc05ded1dc1cc793aa	No..nothing with the word "spiderman" is worth any amount of money.|`|uOZC8S5kaa	HELL NO!!!!

Some other great games I have are:    The World Ends With You  Trauma Center  Cookie & Cream  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Lost in Blue    The way I find new games is by going to http://www.gamefaqs.com.  You can choose the system you want, choose the genre of game you are interested in and they will list all the games available for that system.  You can even look at reviews too, that way you can find out if it's a good game or not.  Happy gaming ;-)|`|59e4b9f1fd97d5d9ac83813ad5fe645aaa	honestly i hate the nintendo ds good advice is to sell it and buy a psp.    but final fantasy and legend of zelda are the best games for the ds|`|EuMtcP33aa	Zelda Phantom Hourglass is probably the best 3 days I've ever spent in my whole life.

ivg0lRUraa	Honestly I can't give any insight into PW as I've only played Silkroad. But I love silkroad. Played it for about a year now. Tons of fun but it does have its cons.  The quests are lame, like getc50-500 of a certain item by killing 500-1000 of certain monster. Its a bit harder to play as european as they have a 15 second potion delay and you cant wear armor until you have your mastery level up, where as chinese only have a one second potion delay and can wear any armor up to your character level. The game is free and the mall items that you can purchase aren't really that tempting. Theres not much chance you'll blow to much money with this game. Lots of fun if you can meet the right people. Let me know if you decide to play on Ares server and I'll hook you up with a bunch of cool guilds that'll help you out.
fEeEP7vYaa	id say just get another 360.  you could just recover your gamer tag everytime you go to your other house.

(maybe that's why its free??)    but yea dude   sounds like ur into the online gaming.  id just stick with the 360.  you can get it for cheap too   it doesn't have to be an elite or the 60g  ya know?    well i hope that help ya out a little bit.  :)|`|XnP8vXHgaa	You may as well go the hole hog mate lol,treat urself to a ps3,u already have the best console there is which is the 360 so u may as well get the 2nd best also mate,enjoy ur gaming mate.|`|rnVdxXotaa	Get a ps3, if you need a bluray then get a ps3 its cheaper than getting a bluray player plus you can play really good games like killzone 2 and little big planet etc.

Peace!|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	no, that would be boring anyway lol. work and school suck.  they will be rabbit holes, ie buildings the sims will disappear into and come out of.  there will be more game play around work and school though.      Careers   - Jobs pay hourly, not daily.   - While on the job, you have options as to what kind of performance you want to give: Business as Usual, Work Hard, Take it Easy, Meet Coworkers, Hang Out with Coworkers, Suck Up to Boss, or Practice a Skill.   - You can become business partners with community businesses. Once you own the company you can rename it, fire the staff and make use of its facilities for free, so free food or books or movies.   - There are Part-Time and Full-Time jobs. The Part-Time jobs will not interfere with High School hours.   - When a sim is at the top of its career, the others sims are aware and react to it. When your sims is a rock'n'roll-star Sims will ask for an autograph; a high-ranked soldier is greeted in the street.   - If you interact with your boss, you can ask to increase your salary or to get promoted.   - Part time jobs for teens, adults and elders: Bookstore clerk, grocery store clerk, Spa receptionist, Spa specialist, Burial specialist.     Pregnancy, baby,toddler,child   - There is School Detention for children who fall asleep in class or cheat on schoolwork.   - School time: 9am-2pm for teens and 9am-3pm for children.|`|bx63jJVnaa	They do, but you cant go inside the workplace or school with them.

CKRfaRYvaa	Try wildgames.com.  You can play any game on that site (including the tycoon games) twice for as long as you want each time.  After the second time, you can buy the game if you haven't finished it already, or you can play again for $1.  It works kind of like an arcade where you buy tokens and use them to play the games once you're out of free plays.
