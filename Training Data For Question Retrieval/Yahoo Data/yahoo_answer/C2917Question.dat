20090220081312AAxoZEt	Environment;Global Warming	Is there anyone out there who apart from me who does not believe in recycling their rubbish?	I think it is a complete waste of time to be quite honest.I have 4 wheelie bins in my garden but I only use one of them. Why should I separate all of my rubbish when that is what I pay council tax for. Why should I do their job for them? Bin men of today in my opinion are just lazy bastards. Years ago they had to go round your back and lift big heavy metal bins empty the rubbish and then put the bin back. Now they have got it easy. Who really cares about what happens to the environment it 100 years time we wont be around to care so why bother recycling it is going to mean F all to us. I would like to know how many other people out there don’t recycle and your own opinions on it.

I mean if someone calls me a chimp or a gorilla i would actually take it the positive way, do you know how agile and strong chimps are? i would like to be as strong as a gorilla and as agile as a chimp.      but anyway why do some people get offended being compared to animals, are we that much different from animals that it offends us when we are being compared to them? from what i know we are animals. I mean animals should be getting offended being compared to such horrible creatures like us humans.

20061201132946AAvYrVC	Environment	Why do people cut down trees?	IT is unfair and makes it worse for the environment. WIthout trees, then there will be no oxygen and tree also give tons of beauty. Not all people respect the trees, but soon there will be no more left and the environment will be fully horrible and there also will be no more oxygen (air) anymore in the earth.
