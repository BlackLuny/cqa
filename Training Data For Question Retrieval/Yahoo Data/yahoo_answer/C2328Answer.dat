cstW6JLIaa	Well, first of all, forget your parents. Unless they're paying your tuition, they have no say in which path you take in your education (my parents haven't paid a dime for my schooling -- so whatever I do is up to me).<br>  <br>  Secondly, what are the reasons you hate high school? Is it the social environment that bothers you (cliques, popularity, bullying, peer pressure)? Or do you just hate the load of homework?<br>  <br>  If it happens to be the latter, then college probably is not for you. College requires much more time for schoolwork and studying; there is no "flying by" in college.<br>  <br>  But if you hate high school because you're not social, then you'd do fine in college. Students are much more dedicated (at least some of them) and mind their own business. There are no cliques, popular groups, or bullying. And unless you live in a dorm and join a sorority, you won't come across a whole ton of peer pressure.<br>  <br>  You need to try out college to begin with. If I were you, I'd stick around home for at least 6 months to a year while taking primarily courses at a community college. It'll give you an idea of what the workload is like, and you might get a clue on what you'd like to do as a career.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VZ21gL81aa	can't tell what they might be smoking, but as long as they share.... LOL<br>  <br>  They are NOT ready to let you go! simple! You are their baby and ot let you go off into the world is to not have you there anymore.<br>  <br>  They will grow out of it...... maybe by the time you are 35 or 40 you will start to think that maybe they all of a sudden got a lot smarter.<br>  <br>  College work can be a breeze if you are organized, or a drudge if you are a slacker (I don't sense this from you). You spend 40-45 hours a week  strictly on schoolwork and classes, then you hav eto find things ot do with the rest of your time. Obviously, you haven't yet demonstrated that you can do this part of it.<br>  <br>  Of course, the parents may not really have a clue about college.......|`|cJXUFV59aa	what kind of parents don't want their child to go to college and be successful...<br>  <br>  OF COURSE YOU SHOULD GO! dont listen to them!!|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	as a college freshman here is my take on your problem:<br>  <br>  It seems like you have yourself together in high school. if you make good grades now then college really shouldn't be a problem. However, you do have all the freedom in the world (well not exactly) and you can do whatever you want so you have to learn how to manage your time with school and partying (if you plan on doing that).<br>  <br>  I think that you should at least try it  for a semester and if you honestly don't like it, then take some time off. or do it backwards; if your parents really think that you're not ready, get a job for a semester and show them that you can be responsible.

Gwf998x5aa	"The US started the war to invade Canada - Britain and Canadian troops drove them out. Then to punish them, Britain invaded the US, and though lost some battles, destroyed the Whitehouse and captured Maine.<br>  The British army left US soil when the peace treaty was signed, and then gave Maine Back."<br>  <br>  Thats pretty much the way I see it. What many Americans tend to forget is that the objective of the US at the start of the war was to annex Canada. Not to gain a national anthem, a lick of white paint at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or to give Baltimore a tourist attraction.<br>  <br>  From this, it would take a marvelous feat of imagination to consider it an American victory.

Dh0JX2Onaa	Here are some suggestions.<br>  <br>  1. Have all of your materials ready and in the place that you are going to study.<br>  <br>  3. Study when its quiet. No music, no TV, No headphones, no nothing.<br>  <br>  4. Do your most difficult subject fist or else you may never get to it.<br>  <br>  5. Keep a calendar so that you know when a project is due or a test is going to be given.<br>  <br>  6. Vocabulary is very important. Words have different meanings. You need to know the meaning for the subject that you are taking.<br>  <br>  7. Study the relationship of things. How is the topic that you studied related to the unit that you are studying?<br>  <br>  8. Your textbook has hints for you.

6EoShfYIaa	this is an interesting question but an array is variable that can hold multiple values for example the array month could have 12 values where Month[1] would be january.  This would allow create a plus and minus next to month and increment i with the plus or minus and visually change the month.  So if your on january and they hit the + i becomes 2 and then Month[i] becomes february.  You can also do Days[1] to increment how many days in the month or do a 3d array of month where month[1][1] is month name and month[1][2] is the days in that month. If you do that however you will have to do year % 4 to see if there is  remainder.  If there is a remainder its not a leap year and feb has 28 days no remained = leap year and 29 days.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps

zgTsCicNaa	Do you mean the Isle of Wight? Then the answer is NO.<br>  <br>  In an earlier blog, I claimed that everyone on the planet could stand on the island and there'd be room to spare.<br>  <br>  But with a biro, sheet of paper and a calculator - plus some reference books - I have made the following calculation:<br>  <br>  If we allow every person on the planet to stand in a space one metre wide by one metre long (just over 39 inches each way - or approximately one pace by a human adult) we could not fit them onto the Isle of Wight. So everyone there can breathe out again, sit down and relax.<br>  <br>  At the last count (just a few moments ago on the internet) the population of the planet was 6,589,339,550. And if they needed one square metre each that would mean a space of 6,589,339,550 square metres.<br>  <br>  Isle of Wight? Too small. it's only 380 square kilometres in area so we'd only get 380,000,000 people on it.<br>  <br>  Now Iceland, that's bigger, much bigger. That has an area of 103,000 square kilometres. And on there we could stand 103,000,000,000 people.<br>  <br>  There's only 6,589,339,550 so far. So everyone could stand - shivering, I'm sure - on Iceland. With bags of room to spare.<br>  <br>  Now look at the atlas again, and find Iceland - it's in the Atlantic Ocean north-west of the UK towards the Arctic icecap.<br>  <br>  Then compare Iceland with the rest of the world. Now see if you can believe that if everyone in the world can stand on that insignificant island that those people can have a great deal of impact on the remainder of the planet. And remember over 70% of it is water.<br>  <br>  ?|`|YmIYFLOBaa	Wong...it would only accommodate wight people...|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	yes as long as they all stand on one leg .lol|`|AA11136470	just maybe not all at the same time

They survived on what would seem to us a pittance, trapping appreciable numbers of fur-bearing animals and working inordinate hours every day.  While the money they received from trading was negligible, there was never a paucity of food as they could survive off the land.  Even though there were few real mountain men, they blazed the trails, allowing civilization to follow and proliferate.

ohn6Nv1baa	No. Parents always have the final authority. If your parents don't want you staying after regular school hours the school has to respect that. My parents didn't agree with a few of the classes that my school wanted me to take so they wrote a note and I was excused from those. Once, I was required to go to the school conselor after school over a misunderstanding. My parents had a fit, talked with the principal and I stopped going to the conselor. There was a book that we had to write a book report on and my parents disagreed with the moral of the story so they talked to the teacher and I was allowed to write a report on a different book. I still had to write the report though.<br>  <br>  The key is to have your parents involved with your school. They have no authority if they don't make their wishes known. If you think that you had been penalized for something that you shouldn't have been talk to your parents and have them schedule a parent-teacher conference. <br>  <br>  It sounds as if you did semi-deserve the detention. Parents have authority over a teacher, not you. By fighting with the teacher directly you undermined her/his authority. You should have kept quiet and talked to your parents about it and let them handle it.|`|AA10188961	Your teachers have authority over you during school hours. <br>  <br>  Your parents have direct authority over you.  Your parents can come get you, but you may have to face consequences.  The school cannot detain you without parent consent.  <br>  <br>  In my experience, you are probably taking the teacher out of context.  What did you do I would like to know that would cause such a remark? Did the teacher specifically call you stupid, or did she say your actions were stupid?  There is a big difference.  Some kids just don't want to take responsibility for their actions and want their parents to come to their rescue.  Problem is, someday those kids grow up, and mommy and daddy aren't there to smooth everything over.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	during school hours, it's your teachers, but before and after, your parents. I sure hope you reported this teacher for her comments. They were rude and totally out of line. If she is the one that gave you detention, I would fight it.|`|P1mf9Zzeaa	During the school hours it should be the teachers, and the parents should generally respect that.  Whether or not that is always the case is largely dependent on the parent.  Though what your teacher said is not exactly something that a teacher should say.  I agree that it's inappropriate, but to answer your question, during school hours and in their class, the teacher is the one that has the authority.
cn0ALwwLaa	The Titanic was supposed to be the grand symbol of opulence and luxury. There was no finer expression of status or social standing than to be one of the elite on the Titanic's maiden (first) voyage. It was even bigger than the Lusitania, which I believe was a British ship of the same idea. Look that up to confirm that.<br>  <br>  Nobody knew it was going to sink, and the cold water made the steel very brittle and the iceberg made it the beginning of the end. Very tragic, and -was- young Leonardo DiCaprio's best movie.<br>  <br>  I saw some trailer for some film with Leo DiCap and Kate Winslet again, like After The Titanic or something dumb. An insult to the first film. Perhaps that was not Titanic, but I believe it was because it looked like it could have come OUT of the movie Titanic. I think they made it, and it was wise not to release it because asking us to beliebe that Jack survived was outrageous.<br>  <br>  Im really sorry for the segway to the film, but if my first paragraph helped you with your homework as a starting point, -please- select it as Best Answer. It would be much appreciated, as I want a good grade like you do.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|E28mQDX0aa	The Titanic disaster had a huge influence on the maritime industry at the time. And still to this day, the rules and regulations put forth after the disaster are still followed today.<br>  <br>  After the disaster, two committees were formed (one in America and the other in England) in order to look into the disaster and try to figure out what went wrong and why exactly the ship sank. In their follow up reports, they focused on four major points: lifeboat regulations, changes in shipbuilding codes, the proper procedure to follow in the presence of floating ice, and the regulation of the wireless equipment and operators on board ships.<br>  <br>  In regards to the lifeboats, prior to the disaster, they had been going by The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 which stated that the number of lifeboats of a passenger ship should be based on the tonnage of the ship. This law was completely scrubbed and a new one was made that made number of lifeboats on board based on the amount of people on the board not the tonnage.<br>  <br>  In regards to the ship building codes, The following is a list of the recommendations made by the inquiries held in America:<br>  1. The watertight bulkheads should run the entire length of the ship and be double plated.<br>  2. These same bulkheads should run all the way up to the lowest deck of the ship.<br>  3. The lowest deck of the ship should be watertight.<br>  4. Rivets should not be made with so much sulfur, in order to prevent them from becoming brittle in cold water so easily.<br>  <br>  The British recommendations were as follows:<br>  1. Create a Bulkhead Committee in order to provide ship builders with the most advanced technology concerning the building of bulkheads.<br>  2. The bulkheads should extend the length of the ship and be extended at least thirty feet above the waterline.<br>  3. There should be a planned number of decks that should be water tight and how many and how far above the waterline they should be.<br>  <br>  These regulations would be heavily enforced by both the Board of Trade in Britain and the Senate in the United States.<br>  <br>  The International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea met in the winter of 1913, the most important thing that came out of this was the International Ice Patrol. A patrol that was set up in order to patrol the North Atlantic for icebergs and warn passing ships of the danger.<br>  <br>  The American Committee made suggestions in regards to the wireless that eventually became part of the Radio Act of 1912. Some of the suggestions were: there should always be at least one wireless operator on duty at all times (meaning that each ship should have two), there should be a direct way for the wireless room to be connected to the bridge (either by phone or a messenger), the wireless should always be able to work even if the engines were not on. The British Committee, after the third International Conference on Wireless Telegraphy it presented its own recommendations, which were very similar to that of the American committee.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!

lbR1IoiSaa	FAFSA / the government and your educational institution determine, based upon a formula used to interpret your ability to pay, from your tax returns / parents tax returns, investments, and other assets, how much $ you qualify for in government sponsored grants, and / or loans. <br>  <br>  No one here can even give you a close idea as to how much you will 'get' - because it depends on your program cost, and the information I listed above re: your income and assets. <br>  <br>  If you went to high school and graduated from a 'distinguished' program (AP classes and sl more credits then is required in general), you can qualify for an ACG (academic competitiveness grant).  These usually are a few hundred dollars to perhaps a thousand per year (NOT semester).  <br>  <br>  A federal pell grant is available, and usually granted to those who come from low income households, where - once you complete your fafsa, will have a very low or 0 efc, or "expected family contribution."  I believe PELL grants have been increased to a little over $5k, distributed at several times throughout the year to your institution's financial aid office.  You may qualify for a full PELL, or only a partial, but hey, free money is free money, and less you have to take out in loans!   Also remember, whatever EFC the government gives you, doesn't mean you'll end up coming out of pocket for that much $$, but it IS a pretty good indicator of what you may have to pay on your own.  If you will have to - just make sure you make timely payments to your institution by the due date, otherwise they'll refuse admission to your next semester's classes until it's paid.  Communication with them is critical!<br>  <br>  GSL's - or guaranteed student loans, are federally sponsored, and come as Stafford Loans, subsidized and unsubsidized.  Subsidized are those loans where the government will pay the interest while you are in school, unsubsidized are those which start accruing interest the minute you take them out.  You can either make the interest payments, or they'll tack them on to the back of your loan.  <br>  <br>  As a first year undergraduate, if they haven't changed this amount, you should qualify for up to - geez, i forget - sorry :(.  <br>  <br>  Most institutions also have scholarship funds, merit and need based, and they usually have endowments from which they can give loads of money - spread across many students.  Endowments are big pots of $$ that people have given to the institution either as an alumni, or just to be good people and have the ability to write off some of their cash. <br>  <br>  To get a realistic idea as to how much you will be awarded, you should check out the website <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov</a> for detailed information on how much in loan funding you can qualify for  -  for each 'year' of college (freshman, sophmore, etc), and you can also check out <a href="http://www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov/</a> - to get a better idea of how you will fare initially. <br>  <br>  The fafsa.ed.gov website contains a wealth of information, and if you have trouble finding it all, call 1-800-4-fed-aid, 24/7.  Their agents are very understanding and very capable of explaining anything to you, as they're trained that way because they know the information they share has to be ACCURATE. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	depends on your and your parent's income. if you guys make too much, then you don't get much.|`|S6PzfCS7aa	It totallly depends if you'll be living on your own and how much you make and your parents make.

N1sUBn5Qaa	"Let discretion be the better part of valor," is the line uttered by Falstaff in Shakespeare's Henry IV to excuse his own choice to be a coward than face his own death. <br>  <br>  But as with most Shakespear, there is a double meaning in that While Falstaff has chosen a course of thinking before he acts, Hotspur was all valor and flame, but his inability to think things through were his downfall. <br>  <br>  Ultimately the meaning is that a wise person measures both discretion AND valor before acting, lest he(she) one or the other an excess of either quality.<br>  <br>  But it would be best to read Shakespear to better understand the meaning.|`|vfuM5KtRaa	It's discretion not disgression.<br>  <br>  Discretion is the better part of valour is something that you say which means that it is better to be careful and think before you act than it is to be brave and take risks|`|KBCFVZVNaa	digression  /dagrn/  n.

kV5moq0eaa	I'd definitely go for Munich. As a matter of fact, I already do study in Munich.<br>  <br>  Check the international ranking:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2008/regional_rankings/top_european_universities" rel="nofollow">http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniv...</a><br>  <br>  Munich is 27th (Technical University) and 35th (General University), while Vienna is 41th and Frankfurt 68th.<br>  <br>  No need to say that rankings are not the only thing that matter.<br>  <br>  Student life in Munich is absolutely fantastic. Here's why:<br>  <br>  * The student town. About 2500 Students living there. ONLY students. With parks, clubs, bars, gyms, ... Just imagine.<br>  * Number of students. About 100.000 students in a city of about 1,3 Mio. In summer you'll find them in a park (English garden), playing soccer, making bbq or just chilling. In winter going skiing or any indoor activity imaginable.<br>  * Munich culture. Very laid back, sitting in beer-garden, ...<br>  * Leisure time. Munich offers every activity imaginable. Sports, watching sports, museums, concerts, and so on...<br>  * Oktoberfest. No need to say more.<br>  * Jobs. There are plenty of jobs for students. Huge companies have their headquarters in Munich. Allianz, BMW, Siemens, Infinion and many more smaller ones.<br>  <br>  I really love Munich.|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	Munich, without a doubt!! I have friends currently living in each of these cities, so I know quite a bit about each. <br>  <br>  While Vienna is a beautiful city, and Frankfurt has its merits, its not very studenty, and there's not a lot to do in Frankfurt (compared to other cities), you'll easily get bored. For the student life you're talking about, you want somewhere more student-orientated. If you were asking me to recommend any city to study abroad, I would suggest Tartu in Estonia, the ultimate student town!<br>  <br>  But out of those you mentioned, definately Munich. A good friend of mine lives there and she has an absolute ball. She's herself is German, but I know that there are a lot of expat students there too. I've studied abroad and it is just the greatest most unforgettable experience. The international student community is just the best, and being part of it is incredible and the best fun I ever had (I did it in Nice, and I'm doing it in Tartu in Estonia or Moscow year after next).<br>  <br>  I'm not going to pretend to know loads about Munich, because I haven't been there, I can only go by general knowledge, and my friends that live there. I also did a lot of research on it when I was planning a trip round Europe. It has an incredible nightlife, which is a great plus, and its univeristies/gymnasiums, while difficult to get into, are prestigious and well-respected. My best tip is to buy the Lonely Planet guide 'Central Europe'. It covers all of those cities. I know its a travel guide, but it has excellent sections on all aspects of the cities that you mentioned. I can't emphasise just how useful it is!<br>  <br>  Have a great time, wherever you choose! :D<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, forgot to mention Oktoberfest!!|`|BjsrB6Qvaa	I would definitely go to Vienna I had the opportunity. It is so beautiful. However, I know that American students absolutely love Germany. If I were in your shoes, I would go with Austria, then Munich, and then Frankfurt. Btw, getting accepted into a German university or "gymnasium" is difficult, but your education would be excellent. <br>  <br>  Based on your needs/wants, I honestly don't think Vienna would be the best city for you. In your particular case, I think you should stick with the German schools.

It really sucks that you're not feeling well, but I think that you might feel a little less stressed once you get through that work.<br>  <br>  Try breaking it down into smaller bits.  For example, you could read one chapter of the book and take a short break.  Then you could work on your math worksheet until it's half done.  Next, go back and finish your book.  Then take a break and have a snack and relax for a little bit.  Then you'll be refreshed to work on your summary and illustration.<br>  <br>  It's too bad that you feel your book is boring, but at least once you start then you'll be on your way to being done!!  Two chapters isn't a ton, so you can probably get through it pretty quickly, too.  <br>  <br>  I think you'll feel better about it once you just get started.  And if you're tired try having a little mini dance party for 3 minutes or so.  Just put on a really fun song and jump around and sing for the length of the song.  Then you'll feel energetic and you can get back to work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I know you can do it!  And you can always have a nap tomorrow afternoon if you have to stay up late tonight, so everything will be okay.

So I took the opportunity to truly speak my mind about the so-called "romance" of the play. First of all Juliet is a spoiled little girl, she lacks the maturity needed to convince us that anything she feels is at all true love. I mean she just met the guy. Now Romeo, on the other hand is a Pedophile! He is a grown man, Juliet is nothing but a pre-teen. Now the reason that he would stalk the house of his family's rival all because he fell in "lust" over their little girl I couldn't tell you. Then to think he would kill himself over someone he's only known for what a day? Juliet is an idiot for drinking a potion, pretending to be dead THINKING that a letter would reach Romeo in a day. She doesn't even know where Romeo is! I find that the death of many in this play (Whom I can't remember this was YEARS ago) have no reason. Romeo should not have killed himself because she was stupid enough to pretend to kill herself so they could happily run away together. I mean back then the medicine was not nearly as studied as today, how did she know she would wake up at all? Then if you logically think about this, a person who is not breathing for oh so many minutes, hours, etc WILL die. I feel that she should have died - First. No one kills themselves over someone they barely even know. Then when she decides to revive back to life she see's that her little plan didn't work. She had caused the anonymous/rival/pedophile to kill himself, and see's the man she needed to marry dead too, and kills herself. This was a typical write of shakespear. The Main characters always die in all of his plays, and they always die over something stupid. Sorry if this isn't the tip you needed but this is something like the essay I wrote in that class some years ago. I got an 100% on it, so I know it was a good write. According to the preference of your teacher's taste that is. If you're not in an advanced course, I don't suggest you write this so meek like I have. They might not like you speaking your mind.|`|YWAoSctPaa	Make sure you add how much they loved each other, the irony of their love, the tragedy of their deaths, the irony of their deaths, and how they would secretly see each other.

Its pretty amazing to see how detailed we are.)<br>  <br>  (and Keep in mind that your professor could cover different chapters at different times such as my professor)<br>  <br>  First semester basiclly covers your Amino Acids (you'll have to learn what they are (I think there are 28 or them, their structures, whether their polar or not, their PI's, and pH their functions and ect.), hemoglobin and how that and myoglobin works and so on, proteins, glycolysis, citric cycle <br>  <br>  My Biochemistry 2 class were are going through these topics:<br>  lipids, oxidation of FA (fatty acids), Ketone bodies, Lipid Biosynthesis, Cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis and transport, Biological membrane and transfer, biosignaling, integration and hormonal regulation of metabolism, nucleotides, nucleic acids, metabolism, biosynthesis and degradation of nucleotides, DNA based technologies, tapology, DNA, Protein, and RNA metabolism Regulation of Gene Expression. <br>   <br>  With every thing that goes on in your body there is pretty much a mechnisms (chem. equations) so to break it down there are alot of mechnisms you'll have to know <br>  <br>  the courses are VERY comprehensive for Biochemistry.

MINy26pjaa	The part of speech that expresses existence, action, or occurrence.<br>  <br>  It's a word in the sentence that tells what happened, what was done or what you are.  Some examples are:  was, decided, teach, drive, were, walking, told, do, forget and grab.<br>  <br>  Some words can be used in more than one way (nouns, verbs, and adjectives, etc.) depending on how they are used in the sentence.  Does your teacher want you to underline every word that CAN be used as a verb; or does she want only the ones that ARE used as verbs in the sentences you have?  That may make a difference in which words you want to underline.  <br>  <br>  You need to think about this and learn to do it on your own.  There won't always be someone to do it for you, like when you take a test about it.  What will you do then, if you haven't really learned it?

Peace out!|`|oBgirjGMaa	The Kurdish genocide and the Nazi genocide were very similar. During the 1980’s, Saddam Hussein had a campaign against a group of people called the Kurds. The Kurds are a group of people who don’t have their own nation . They are spread across the middle east and eastern Europe. They live Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, and the former Soviet Union. When Iraq was on war with Iran, the Kurds posed a real threat to Iraq because they were Iranian sympathizers during the war, and aided Iran with their guerrilla forces. When Hitler came to power, he had to deal with people who opposed him. To solve that problem, he had to get rid of them. That’s the same thing that Saddam Hussein did. Iraq didn’t even encourage the Kurds to leave, they just started killing them with strong chemicals bombs. The Kurds were often held prisoner and were taken from their homes. They were forced to move to locations where they would live without choice. It was go, or get killed by the army. Kurds were also tortured, starved, rape and even abused by the state sponsored secret police forces. Although there are differences between the genocides, they were both incredibly similar. <br>  <br>  Fixed most of your spelling/grammatical errors. Copy and paste.

vYNOotEMaa	Several steps to be organized:<br>  Carry a notebook or binder large enough to carry not only each class notes, but a special "things to do" section.<br>  <br>  Keep notes daily in the "things to do" section, what your assignments are, and when due.  Check it off, as you complete assignments, or reading.  Prioritize, complete most important, or hardest ones first.  Save easiest for last, because you may tire quickly, so best to save easy to do last.<br>  <br>  Keep your locker organized, by having first 1/2 days class books on top, and afternoon books on bottom, so you can find them faster.  You can replace top-section at lunch time, and pick up books at bottom, after lunch.<br>  <br>  Carry your homework books and assignments in a book bag, to take home.  (check your "things to do" before leaving school, to make sure you have everything needed)<br>  <br>   Let your parents know what work you have to do.  This makes them happy, that you will be kept busy, and they feel important, because they can tell you to "get busy", lol.<br>  <br>  Ask your teachers lots of questions, so you completely understand the day's lessons, and assignments.<br>   It doesn't make sense to go day to day, confused, and not understanding what has been taught, or what you are expected to do.<br>  <br>  It's too late at test time, to say "I'm not ready."  <br>  <br>  Instead, look forward to test days, to evaluate whether you have been doing your job, and that you have learned what the teachers expected (i.e, passed their tests).<br>  <br>  If you pass, tell your parents, so they can reward you. <br>  If you fail, go back to missed answers, relearn what you failed to remember. <br>  Ask teachers again, for remedial help on those things that the tests showed you lacked understanding.<br>  <br>  If you follow this procedure, and steps outlined above, you will make the honor roll, guaranteed!!.

2045a29b68d5eb83587174faba40e901aa	I would think that the research school would be more for a person who was interested in a career of the Scientific type and the Primary care school is self explanatory, it will give you what you need to become a primary care Physician. My guess would be that even if you were to choose the research school, you would probably still be able to become a Doctor, but you may need more credits. The best advice I could give you is either to call them and ask or find their homepage on the web and look for the contact us link and send them an Email and ask them, then you will know for certain.

AA10583852	advertising to the people in that area....go door to door with flyers advertising your school as the best place for your kids to learn and downgrade the public schools|`|AA11864007	I would say that the first thing you need to figure out is where your target market is.  What kinds of kids are you going to have in your school?  Where will they come from and what are their common interests.  You will need to find the marketing strategy that will best reach the most people in your target market.  Some other strategies would be to come up with a unique way to advertise your strengths to your target market.  Perhaps some sort of fund raiser or raffle that can draw attention to your new school and the benefits of it over public and/or other private schools in your area.  There will be negatives and positives to any advertising and promotions strategy that you can find but the best way to start is to make sure that you know who you are going to target and what their interests are.  Once you learn that it becomes pretty easy to find creative ways to get the word out to that market.  Hope this helps.  I just recently graduated with a degree in business management and I took a whole class on marketing and promotions so I know a little something and have found that when you know who you are trying to sell to before you start makes everything else much easier.  And just wanted to add that whatever that person said about downgrading the public schools is NOT really a good idea.  If you have strong points just try and capitilize on those and not downgrade any of the other educational institutions in the area.

Bmh5xWV1aa	I hope some of these help:<br>  1.  Find a friend to study with.  Sometimes just talking about the chapter helps get it through your head, instead of trying to memorize everything word for word.<br>  2.  As you are reading the chapter, don't just sit there and read, take some notes.  The physical action of writing the notes along with the sensory stimulation of reading helps to clear out a "mental path" that makes it easier for you to remember the information when test day comes.<br>  3.  Go on line and do some research about what you are studying.  Sometimes the information in our textbook is just too boring to stay focused on!<br>  4.  Before you read the chapter or take notes on it, read the review questions at the end of the chapter.  This will prepare your brain with an idea of what you should be learning.<br>  5.  Generally, the more ways you can approach the material in small doses, the more likely the big picture is to stick to your memory:  (i.e. if you do a little of each of the following instead of just a lot of reading, you will be more successful:  make and study flash cards, talk about the subject with a friend, pay attention in class, do some research on the Internet, do your Reading assignment and review questions, take notes as you are reading the chapter.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11596091	Well, if you like music, it would be the best thing to use b/c if you have a cd player or anything with headphones it would be possible.

f2ab298ee002a40adbb517fd222d7b9aaa	I personally do not know which is the "best" and don't know that anybody does.  Most everything I've read is about Great Expectations 1998.  The following is a review...it may help you decide...or not decide?.?.?...... Sorry I couldn't be more help.<br>  <br>  Hollywood and the movie industry have made many bold moves over the past decade in bringing to life old classics. None however have been done more boldly than the remoulding of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and Charles Dicken's Great Expectations. Both are daring attempts to rebirth a storyline from the distant past, as a tale told in our modern times. I say attempt because in both cases, as good a job the cast and crew did, there was something lacking in these new renditions. Great Expectations, the movie, lacks many qualities that make the novel a success. It cannot be said to be a total loss, the basic elements are intact, it is only the embellishments Charles Dickens developed in the novel to make the story more realistic that are missing.<br>  <br>  One success, I must admit that I observed while watching the film was the rich visual setting. Although not taking presented in the same place, or era Great Expectations, the movie, is a feast for the eyes. It captivates the mind with beautiful shots of the rural Florida coast life, and yet still retains the jumbled, rundown atmosphere that is described of Pip's small birthplace in a small English town. These qualities of squalor are evident in the impoverished coastal fishing village of the movie. The best achievement in cinematography, is the in-depth views of Pardiso Perduto, a sister mansion to the decaying Satis house of the novel. Even the scenes of New York, the city of "expectations" for our youthful protagonist, Finn, has contrasting aspects of rich beauty and unsightly slums that the London of the nineteen century demonstrated. This is the most major achievement for the film; to capture on film a most ingenious modern equivalent of Charles Dicken's astute descriptions.<br>  <br>  Unlike some attempts to revamp literary successes the movie at least retains some of the dignity of Dicken's work. The core of his novel is intact within the screenplay. Also many ingenious ideas were used in some plot changes, and cinematography. Overall it is not a bad representation of the novel.|`|9e587969d9254e10de2a311e8edafe98aa	If the movie was called "Great EXPECTORATIONS", I would expect it to star Mark SPITZ!

You get 4 points for an A, 3 points for a B, 2 points for a C and so forth. The points are all added up and divided by the number of classes <br>  There is also the factor of how many credits a class is worth.<br>  If you have a 2.1 or 2.2, you graduated with just above a C - its passing, but not exceptional. Usually most colleges require a higher score in your major as well.|`|AA11864007	Well I think that what you are talking about is what we here in the good ole USA call a GAP also known as grade point average and if your grade point is that low I really dont think you will stand a very good chance of getting into a decent grad school or any other school especially here in America because here a 2.2 or 2.1 is considered a VERY low C almost a D-.  Thats not good.  You need closer to a 3.0 at least to get into a decent school here.  <br>  The scale normally goes<br>  A = 4.0<br>  B= 3.0<br>  C= 2.0<br>  D= 1.0<br>  F= 0<br>  Hope this helps

GATE can be cleared by self studying itself but for CAT ill recommend u to join some classes as it needs constant testing of yuor skills... get to know more by asking your seniors, i am damn sure they ll help u out.... and ya the score is valid for two years in both cases.. and you can extend it for another year by paying some rupees(i think 500)...all the best for your future|`|aPfMaosMaa	Yes you can prepare for GATE and CAT simultaneously.The GATE score is valid for 2 years.|`|cf0e0f93bfcb4901ca7c498c412bf947aa	Even one is difficult.

Also, in some cases, separating girls form boys just makes them all the more eager to mix with the other gender. Also, there is the issue of making school too military and restricting to many things during their youth when they're meant to have freedom.<br>  Also, you might ask yourself what other skills, beside academic ability, they're loosing through not mixing with the opposite gender. Surely, if they are separated important foundation skills like communication can be undermined.<br>  And with regard to academic ability, if they learn in different ways this means that learning together 1 - increases their ability to learn in ways other than the way they are used to and 2 - communication between them enables them to help each other learn and enhance their education.<br>  <br>  I think there are 2 sides to argument; whether a child should or shouldn't go to a same sex school is a unique decision that should be based upon the individual and what's best for them.|`|c9b63aa6e8b9cfe6fdf2037a90d76ba9aa	I can tell you from experience that an all-girls school sucked.

The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield, possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier's terminus. However, this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb, since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate.|`|AA10882285	Mendenhall Glacier is a glacier about 12 miles long located in Mendenhall Valley, about 12 miles from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska.<br>  <br>   <br>  Mendenhall Glacier and LakeOriginally known as Sitaantaagu ("the Glacier Behind the Town") or Aak'wtaaksit ("the Glacier Behind the Little Lake") by the Tlingits, the glacier was named Auke (Auk) Glacier by naturalist John Muir for the Tlingit Auk Kwaan (or Aak'w Kwaan) band 1879.

d912f30d94066ba21182dc60bbdcf53baa	1. I would tackle this as 3:00 (which is a right angle) to 8:59:59 (just before a right angle) and then double the figure (to allow midnight to 2:59:59 and 9:00 to 11:59:59). There are 2 every hour (except for only one at 8-8:59). Therefore in the period between 3:00 and 8:59, there are 11. Double this, and your answer is 22. The reason it is not 24 as you would think is that the hour hand does not point directly to the number when the minute hand is pointing away from the "12". Therefore, although you would think that 3:30 should be a right-angle, it is not, because the hour hand is half-way between the 3 and 4. The right angle would occur at 3:32:43. Try it with an old clock! <br>  <br>  Therefore, each right angle occurs every 32 minutes 43 seconds, or 32.7272 minutes, or every 0.54545454 hours. As you are trying to find the number of 0.54545454s in 12 hours, this is a straight divide - 12 / 0.545454 = 22.<br>  <br>  2. You need to look at this like a triangle. The distance travelled is on the upward slope of the triangle, the altitude is along the vertical side of the triangle. You need to know the horizontal part of the triangle, which you are not given. Therefore to work this out, it is (h*h) + (v*v) = s*s - or in other words, horizontal squared plus vertical squared equals length of slope squared. Therefore by using algebra we could also write (s*s) - (v*v) = h*h.<br>  <br>  This goes for any triangle with a right angle (and yours has that along the horizontal and then up the vertical). Try it with a triangle that has 4 along the horizontal, and 3 along the vertical - you get an answer of 5 along the slope. You can easily draw this to prove it, using 3,4 and 5 inches.<br>  <br>  With your figures, s = 3.25 * 5280 (5280 is the number of feet in a mile) = 17160; v = 6000. <br>  Therefore the sum is: <br>    17160 * 17160 = 294465600. <br>    6000 * 6000 = 36000000<br>  294465600 - 36000000 = 258465600<br>  The Square Root of 258465600 = 16076.865<br>  h = 16076.865, therefore.<br>  <br>  Now you have all the information you require, and it is a straight divide, the calculation is 6000 / 16076.865 = 0.3732 or 37.32%<br>  <br>  3. Now this is one right up my street (see my screen name!). The calculation can be found by knowing the following :<br>  Stops can either add 5 or subtract 3. Therefore, you need to find out how you can make up 11 by just adding 5 or subtracting 3 - but you need to do this in greater than 17 steps. You therefore need enough 5's added together to allow 3's to be subtracted. <br>  <br>  Let's make this easy by creating a pattern :<br>  <br>  3*5 = 15. We can not get to 11 by subtracting 3's<br>  4*5 = 20. 3*3 = 9. This can be done in 7 steps, but too few<br>  5*5 = 25. We can not get to 11 by subtracting 3's<br>  6*5 = 30. We can not get to 11 by subtracting 3's<br>  7*5 = 35. 8*3 = 24. This can be done in 15 steps. Not quite enough<br>  8*5 = 40. We can not get to 11 by subtracting 3's<br>  9*5 = 45. We can not get to 11 by subtracting 3's<br>  10*5 = 50. 13*3 = 39. This can be done in 23 steps. Answer!<br>  <br>  So you can see a pattern evolving. For every 3 stops where 5 people are picked up, you need to drop off 5 stops worth of people to get back to the original number. This is therefore 8 stops. The smallest way of getting to 11 is in 7 stops, and therefore the next way of getting to 11 is 15 stops, then 23, 31, 39 etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that this helps in your homework<br>  <br>  With Best Wishes<br>  <br>  Adrian!|`|yi3gEZoaaa	1.

If you're studying for an essay test (or short answer) I would simply make out an outline of the material that you need to learn, then memorize it. This is because, if you are writing an essay, (or short response) you will have a structured memory of the concept. If you simply memorize flash cards, your thoughts will be fragmented. Remember: when you're writing, you're mind can fill in the details, you must have a structured essay! I have noted through college a correlation between people who study poorly for essays (i.e., they use flashcards) and poor performance. Also, you may read the book to fill in those details; the book may also offer a guideline on how to structure your outline (follow links below on how to outline).<br>  If you are studying for a multiple choice test, it might be better to study flash cards. There are multiple reasons for this. One, it forces you to consciously process the information (because you are reading one side and trying to remember the other, rather than just passively reading). This results in better recall and longer lasting memory. Also, you can mix your cards up, so you aren't subject to what is refered to order effects (basically meaning that you remember the first and last of any series of information: test yourself, try remember a list of numbers, you'll remember the first few and last few). You can break the information up into 3 or 4 cards, making it easier to "chunk" the information. If you're trying to remember TONS of info at once, you're memory won't be as efficient as if you break the info up.<br>  Here are a few memory strategies (told to me by a phd in cognitive psychology):<br>  1. Chunk the information, break it up into categories, then memorize<br>  2. Make the information meaningful. Relate the information to something you KNOW (if you relate it to something already in memory, the new information will likely be stored easier).<br>  3. Pay attention to the information. Memory requires "active engagement"<br>  4. Use Mnemonics, or tricks that help you memorize something. There are two types of mnemonics: pegword technique, in which you associate what you're trying to memorize with something you already know about and visualize it. For example, if you were trying to remember what the word "cavalcade" means, (which means a procession) you could think of "procession" of "cavalry" (which sounds like "cavalcade"). Another mnemonic is the Method of Loci, which you visualize what you are trying to remember in a familiar location. If I were trying to remember the words "Bun," "Tire," Asteroid," "Catfood" I would walk myself through my house, thinking of a bun on my kitchen counter, a tire in my bed, and asteroid crashing through my living room and catfood on my front porch. Follow the link for other mnemonics|`|1c2a0ce020c27201c533b76eac574f7aaa	even though a 93 iz pretty high, i suggest that u study with your freetime and ask you teachers for extra credit, tutoring is an option too|`|6c4621280e924a078e67bb70612d5863aa	Take easier classes<br>  <br>  Get to know the teacher, they will give you better grades if they have a more personal relationship with you and like you.<br>  <br>  Join a study group, teaching information to others and get different points of view helps reinforce the lesson in your mind.|`|89FhvjrBaa	Good that you already get good grades :-)<br>  There are many other activities to do as well like learning some music instrument,trying out some sport,working out,reading some bestseller book, hanging out with friends, appreciating fine music, movies, watching interviews of bigshots and figuring out secret behind their success,grooming your communication skills etc etc,.

However, sometimes it can be difficult to find a balance in life. Do your best but don't get overloaded , you will burn out.....or get obsessed with perfection...that's how anorexia starts and all sorts of other problems.  You are the only one who can judge if you can do better. There are some people who are smart...so smart that they did not have to struggle very hard and they can breeze through high school without really knowing how to study or push themselves to do better. It can be a wake up call to go to college and suddenly find out what its like to have to put time into study. I don't know how hard you are having to push or how much time you have to put in to get the grades you already have. But grades are usually better the more time you put into study and reading and practice. As is everything else in life.

During this voyage they crossed the Gulf of Urabá (on the coast of present-day Columbia), and saw the indian village of Darién in present-day Panama. In Hispaniola Balboa settled down as a planter. However, he soon amassed a large amount of debts, and to escape from his creditors he hijacked on a supplyship headed for San Sebastian on the Gulf of Uraiba, hidden in a cask. The ship was commanded by Martín Fernández de Enciso.<br>  While under way, they met Francisco Pizarro (the later conqueror of Peru), who lead the colony in San Sebastian and told them almost all members of the colony had been massacred by indians. Enciso nevertheless decided to go on to San Sebastian, but his ship shipwrecked, the men being rescued by Pizarro, but all supplies and livestock being lost, and the colony was in ashes. Balboa, by now accepted as a crew member of Enciso's, convinced them to try again in the area around Darién.<br>  <br>  They subdued the indians, started a colony and built a village. Balboa made the colonists reject both Enciso's authority and that of Diego de Nicuesa, who was sent to Darién as governor after Enciso had sought redress with King Ferdinand. Balboa became de facto leader of the colony. Both the colony and Balboa himself thrived under his policies, making friends with surrounding indians, and subduing and looting those who did not want to. He heared of a great sea on the other side of the mountains, and a land of great wealth (Birú, the Inca empire) to the south of this sea. As he heared that the king wanted to sent him back to be tried for his conduct towards Enciso and Nicuesa, he decided he had to move fast.<br>  <br>  On September 1, 1513, he sailed to San Blas (a lucky choice, as it just happens to be the smallest point of the isthmus), and went south across the isthmus. As before he befriended the indians who were inclined to do so, and captured, tortured and looted those that remained hostile, thus gaining substantial treasure. Finally he reached a top from where he could see the Pacific. When the others had joined him a Te Deum was chanted, a cross erected, and the sea was christened Mar del Sur (South Sea). He pushed on to the edge of the ocean, and Balboa claimed the ocean and all adjacent lands for Spain.<br>  <br>  On the road back they captured an indian chief called Tubanama and got a huge ransom, but some members almost died of hunger because they had loaded treasure in preference to provisions. On January 18, 1514, Balboa was back in Darién.<br>  <br>  While Balboa was away, Pedro Arias de ávila (generally known as Pedrarias) had been sent to Darién as a governor. Although this time Balboa did not oppose him openly, tension between them remained, Pedrarias being envious because Balboa was much more popular than himself. Balboa embarked on a new, courageous expedition by building ships on the Pacific coast. The transport of the materials across the isthmus costed the lives of many indian slaves. Balboa made one expedition with the ships, to the Pearl Islands in the Gulf of Panama. He tried to head south from there, but found the wind unfavorable.<br>  <br>  Pedrarias, being convinced that Balboa wanted to establish a government of his own on the west coast, had him arrested and tried for treason. Under pressure of Pedrarias Balboa was convicted and sentenced to death, and on January 21, 1519 Balboa was beheaded.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Other webpages on Balboa: <br>  <br>  Encyclopedia Britannica: Balboa, Vasco Nu?ez de (copied by "La Conquista") <br>  Hispanos Famosos: Vasco Nú?ez de Balboa <br>  The Catholic Encyclopedia: Vasco Nu?ez de Balboa <br>  Hermann Mückler: Balboa, Vasco Nu?ez de <br>  Eryn M.

Bohlander (editor): World Explorers and Discoverers. New York et al.: Macmillan Publishing Company (1992) <br>  <br>  Vasco Nunez de Balboa<br>  <br>  Vasco Nunez de (VAHS koh NOO nyayth day) Balboa (bal BOH uh) (1475?-1519), a Spanish conqueror and explorer, was the first European to see the eastern shore of the Pacific Ocean. He sighted the ocean in late September 1513, from a mountaintop in what is now Panama. Soon afterward, on Sept. 29, 1513, Balboa waded into the ocean and claimed it and all its shores for Spain. His findings opened Spanish exploration and conquest along the western coast of South America. <br>  <br>  The Spaniards called the ocean the South Sea because it lay south of the Isthmus of Panama, a strip of land that links North and South America. In 1520 and 1521, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailed across the ocean during a voyage for Spain. He named the ocean Pacific, meaning peaceful. <br>  <br>   <br>  This map traces Vasco Nunez de Balboa's journeys in the Caribbean. Balboa helped establish the colony of Darien in 1510. In 1513, he led an expedition across the Isthmus of Panama and sighted the Pacific Ocean.<br>  <br>  World Book map<br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Early life<br>  <br>  Balboa was born in Jerez de los Caballeros, Spain. His father, though perhaps a nobleman, had neither influence nor wealth. Young Vasco served in the household of a rich nobleman in Moguer, a port on Spain's southwest coast. After Christopher Columbus reached America in 1492, many ships heading for the New World took on sailors and supplies at Moguer. Sailors who returned to the port from America often told stories about the new lands across the sea. <br>  <br>  The opportunities for fame and wealth in the New World attracted Balboa. In 1501, he joined a Spanish expedition to South America. The party explored the north coast of the continent, including an area along the Gulf of Uraba in what is now Colombia. However, the expedition lacked enough people to attempt a settlement. In 1502 it sailed to the island of Hispaniola, the main Spanish base in America. Balboa had a hard time making a living on the island. For a time, he raised pigs there. <br>  <br>  return to top <br>  <br>  <br>  Rise to fame<br>  <br>  In 1509, the first Spanish expedition to colonize the mainland of South America left Hispaniola. Balboa attempted to join the expedition. But he had fallen heavily into debt, and people to whom he owed money prevented him from leaving Hispaniola. <br>  <br>  On the mainland, the Spaniards established the settlement of San Sebastian along the eastern side of the Gulf of Uraba. In 1510, Balboa stowed away on a ship that carried supplies and new settlers to the colony. After reaching the mainland, the new settlers met the survivors of San Sebastian, who had abandoned the settlement because of dangerous Indians and a lack of food. The two groups united and returned to San Sebastian briefly. Balboa, who probably had more experience on the continent than any of the other settlers, suggested moving to the western side of the gulf. He had seen the area during his first expedition and knew that the Indians who lived there were more peaceful. The Spaniards moved to the site and established the town of Santa Maria de la Antigua del Darien, usually called Darien. <br>  <br>  Balboa became acting governor of Darien. He led expeditions into Panama, conquering some Indians and making agreements with others in the area. In 1511, Indians told Balboa of a land called Tubanama, where he could find much gold. According to the Indians, this land was located across the mountains near a great sea. <br>  <br>  return to top <br>  <br>  <br>  Balboa's New World journeys<br>  <br>  Balboa knew he had only a weak claim to the governorship of Darien, and so he wanted to please King Ferdinand of Spain. Early in September 1513, Balboa led an expedition from Darien. The group of 190 Spaniards and a large number of Indians followed Indian trails across the isthmus. During the third week of the trip, Balboa's Indian guides told him the ocean could be seen from a nearby mountain. Balboa, ordering his men to stay behind, advanced to the peak and sighted the Pacific. <br>  <br>  The Spaniards found gold and pearls on the Pacific Coast. Balboa believed his findings would win him an appointment as permanent governor of Darien.<br>  <br>  return to top <br>  <br>  <br>  Later exploration<br>  <br>  Before the news of Balboa's expedition reached Spain, Ferdinand appointed Pedrarias Davila, an elderly nobleman, to be the new governor. Pedrarias, as he was called, arrived in Darien in 1514. Ferdinand finally heard of Balboa's findings and named him to serve under Pedrarias as governor of a new area on the Pacific coast of Panama. Balboa established the town of Acla on the north coast and transported materials across the isthmus to build ships for further conquest and exploration. The Spaniards completed two ships by 1518, and Balboa explored along the Gulf of Panama. He also considered an expedition to conquer the area now known as Peru. <br>  <br>  Execution<br>  <br>  Pedrarias grew increasingly jealous of Balboa, who had become a powerful figure with many supporters. In 1518, the governor falsely accused Balboa of treason and had him arrested. Pedrarias arranged for a speedy trial, and Balboa was sentenced to death. In January 1519, Balboa and four friends were beheaded in the public square of Acla.<br>  <br>  Execution<br>  <br>  Pedrarias grew increasingly jealous of Balboa, who had become a powerful figure with many supporters.

Some people have not had the privelege of formal education, learning manners, coming from a loving home, etc.  Those are all priveleges that skew how any one person sees the world.

338bfdec602da3d0e810e79c55f5a351aa	The Samurai rose out of these continuing battles for land among three main clans: the Minamoto, the Fujiwara and the Taira. The Samurai eventually became a class unto themselves between the 9th and 12th centuries A.D. They were called by two names: Samurai (knights-retainers) and Bushi (warriors). Some of them were related to the ruling class. Others were hired men. They gave complete loyalty to their Daimyo (feudal landowners) and received land and position in return. Each Daimyo used his Samurai to protect his land and to expand his power and rights to more land. <br>  <br>  Achieving military success in the country, Yoritomo obtained permission from the emperor to establish a system of shugo (shuu-go) or "guards". for all of the districts and provinces as a means of keeping order. <br>  <br>  The position of shugo gradually became hereditary and consolidated the development of an elite class of professional warriors. As the generations passed, these warrior families became clans and grew to be more powerful than the hereditary lords they served (most of whom were descendants of noble families from Kyoto). These shugo gradually came to be known as samurai (which is another reading for "guards"). They developed a code, based on Confucian and Zen Buddhist principles, that came to be known as bushido, or the Way of the Warrior. This code was to dictate virtually every aspect of their lives and influence the total culture of the country until modern times.|`|c369e0f2d3f2cdbb2a84551a304e2a75aa	look up fuedal japan. that will give u a general idea. the samurai was the knight of fuedal japan. so hopefully that helps|`|a81dd38748a1a671df0f0d4fce895284aa	i think around 660 B.C.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/OniBushi/id38.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/OniBushi/id38....</a>

In 1937, Massengill, a Tennessee drug company, began to market a liquid sulfa drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide. Unfortunately, the solvent in this drug was a highly toxic variant of antifreeze; as a result, over 100 people died from taking this drug. Public outcry over this tragedy was critical in breaking the Congressional deadlock over tighter regulation (Young 1967; Jackson 1970; Carpenter and Sin 2002).<br>  <br>  Under the 1938 law, the FDA was given considerably greater authority over the food and drug industry. The FDA was granted the power to regulate the therapeutic claims drug manufacturers printed on their product labels; authority over drug advertising, however, rested with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938. Additionally, the new law required that drugs be marketed with adequate directions for safe use, and FDA authority was extended to include medical devices and cosmetics. Perhaps the most striking and novel feature of the 1938 law was that it introduced mandatory pre-market approval for new drugs. <br>  <a href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Law.Food.and.Drug.Regulation" rel="nofollow">http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Law.F...</a><br>  <br>  For the full story<br>  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/history/elixir.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/oc/history/elixir.htm...</a>|`|7b04258a9254c4fa8d300fdb896389c4aa	The Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938 which was constituted by the Fairy Princess Amanda Penza im period 11 financial Lit clause "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce are hereby declared unlawful" to the Section 5 prohibition of unfair methods of competition, in order to protect consumers as well as competition.<br>  <br>  Wheeler-Lea, in an attempt to combat fraud, placed greater limits on the kinds of facts that could appear in ads. But in so doing, the legislation had an unintended side effect: it led the more legitimate advertisers to skirt regulation by omitting all facts. Ironically, the law only made matters worse for advertising's critics: ads grew increasingly indirect and emotional.

The first thing you're going to have to do is review the actual literature for your topic.  Next, you'll need to identify some themes that emerge from what you've read, and formulate an outline for your paper.  You'll want to be sure to include what scholars have said about your topic, then critique what they've said, then offer your suggestion for additional research (what you plan to do in your study).<br>  <br>  (This is putting it in really basic terms, so make sure you see your advisor or professor for any specific instructions they may have.)

AA11094648	I'd try and take triple science for gcse. Apart from that, there's not a lot of gcse's that are specific for medical school. So go with what ones you enjoy and are good at. <br>  <br>  As for a-levels, yes you will need to do a-levels most likely, because you usually (there are some exceptions) need a-levels to get into university to do your medical degree. <br>  <br>  There are probably no specific a-levels you need as long as you have high marks on all of them, but once again science ones such as biology will be the most helpful, maybe maths to. <br>  <br>  Have a look at some university websites of schools you'd perhaps like to go to (I know it's early to think about it, but a little research won't hurt) and check the admissions, that'll give you some idea on what they favour. <br>  <br>  Usually, as long as you have high marks in your gcse's and a-levels, it's not a big deal which they are in. But it helps to take ones which will be relevant as they will give you a head start.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d1daf3b2f658eaebd75e3da606cb4730aa	when you ay triple science, do you meen doing each of the sceinces (chemistry, physics and biology separatly)? if you do i would say this is probably the best option as it gives you the best foundation to go and do sciences at A level. You would almost certainly need Biology and Chemistry at A level plus i would think one or two other subjects,preferably somting 'academic' each with a high grade (A or above) to get onto a good medical course. Of course, each course will have slightly different entry requirements so it is important to look at their prospectus' and at the UCAS website/guide to see what you need. I would advise against takng easier routes or less subjects, since places on this course tend to be highly saught after and you want to show that you have everything it takes.

(makes sense)<br>  Me went to the park. (doesn't make sense)|`|otzuZLMHaa	This is how i do it: Use it in a sentence:<br>  1. Leslie and I went to the beach.<br>       - Substitute the I into the sentence. I went to the beach.<br>       - You can't say: Me went to the beach. So you would use Leslie and I.<br>  Another example:<br>  2. My mom bought a cake for Leslie and me.<br>     - If you substitute I into the sentence, it wouldn't make sense. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|NLSA6hXAaa	Ok, here's what my grammar teacher taught me to do years ago, it's a good trick and it works...when you have a sentence like "Would you like to go with Leslie and ??? to the movies?"  Make believe Leslie is  NOT in the sentence...how would you finish it if you were going by yourself?  Would you say "Would you like to go with I to the movies?"  No, you'd say "Would you like to go with ME to the movies?"  So, here the pronoun would be with Leslie and ME.<br>  If you were saying "Leslie and ???? are going to the store."   Pretend that Leslie is not in the sentence....would you say "Me are going to the store?" NO!  You would say "I am going to the store."  So, here the pronoun would be Leslie and "I" are going to the store.  So, rule of thumb or the trick is, pretend that Leslie or whoever, i.e., my sister, my brother, whoever.....is not in the sentence....you'll pick the right pronoun.  Hope this helps......

However, there are many other answers that might work too. For example, 23 is also a possible answer. And you can get other possible answers if you assume that the number has more than three digits.

We'll see pictures of the little boy or girl with a flag, and one somewhat older marching with his or her granddad's medals.<br>  <br>  The video and audio packages will be well produced and slick.

mFtQfSbuaa	Here's a strategy I recommend for verifying trig identities:<br>  1) Commit to memory a few "key identities";<br>  2) Convert your complicated identity to an expression of sines and cosines;<br>  3) Reduce the expression of sines and cosines algebraically to their lowest form and compare both sides of the equation.<br>  <br>  The most important identities I would recommend committing to memory (and verifying them with right triangles in the way the previous respondent recommended) are these five:<br>  <br>  tan x = sin x / cos x<br>  cot x = cos x / sin x<br>  sec x = 1 / cos x<br>  csc x = 1 / sin x<br>  sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1<br>  <br>  You can get just about anywhere from here.<br>  <br>  Let's apply these to your first example:<br>  <br>  tan x = sin x sec x;<br>  Substitute sin x / cos x for tan x and 1 / cos x for sec x;<br>  sin x / cos x = sin x * (1 / cos x) <br>  which, on inspection, you can see they are the same.<br>  <br>  Now let's try your second example:<br>  tan x sin x = cos x;<br>  Substitute sin x / cos x for tan x;<br>  (sin x / cos x ) * sin x = cos x;<br>  sin^2 x / cos x = cos x, <br>  <br>  which are not the same.  If you want to be pedantic, bring the cos x in the denominator of the left-hand side to the right, i.e.,<br>  <br>  sin^2 x = cos^2 x, which is not an identity.<br>  <br>  You can use the same principle to determine which of the last two expressions is a trig identity as well.<br>  <br>  Later, you'll probably learn more complicated identities, like sum- and difference-angle identities.  Again, you'll learn that committing a few simple rules to memory will help you dominate over even the most complicated of identities you 're likely to run into.<br>  <br>  These principles got me through classes as tough as graduate-level college physics, where you run into complicated trig identities routinely.  It's much easier to remember a few simple rules and build up from them than it is to remember all the identities you're likely to need, and it's certainly easier than using a lookup table all the time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Work hard and stay away from drugs.|`|def680773285bb059a699792109b8d3daa	You can always check to see if  the equation is an identity if you use the definitions.  Let O = opposite side, A= adjacent side and H = hypotenuse.<br>  <br>  In the first equation, since tan x = O/A, sin x = O/H and sec x = H/A, we have by substitution<br>  <br>  sin x sec x = (O/H)(H/ A) = O/A = tan x.  So, the 1st equation is an identity.<br>  <br>  In the 2nd equation<br>  <br>  tan x sinx = (O/A)(O/H) = O^2/(AH) which is not equal to cos x.  cos x = A/H.<br>  <br>  I will let you try to check out the other two equations.|`|AA10881555	Tan^2x=sec^2x +1 is a pythagorean trig identity.

But I'm ashamed to look innocent ( Heart White) hearted after being so murderous"<br>  <br>  Lady Macbeth says this to liken herself to Macbeth as an equal partner in the Crime of murdering Duncan. She wants him to believe that they are equal partners in the guilt.<br>  <br>  How Clever & manipulative Lady Macbeth is!.<br>  <br>  .|`|EezS5Qztaa	Summary: Act II, scene ii<br>  Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood<br>  Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather <br>  The multitudinous seas incarnadine, <br>  Making the green one red. <br>  <br>  (See Important Quotations Explained)<br>  As Macbeth leaves the hall, Lady Macbeth enters, remarking on her boldness. She imagines that Macbeth is killing the king even as she speaks. Hearing Macbeth cry out, she worries that the chamberlains have awakened. She says that she cannot understand how Macbeth could fail—she had prepared the daggers for the chamberlains herself. She asserts that she would have killed the king herself then and there, “[h]ad he not resembled / [her] father as he slept” (II.ii.12–13). Macbeth emerges, his hands covered in blood, and says that the deed is done. Badly shaken, he remarks that he heard the chamberlains awake and say their prayers before going back to sleep. When they said “amen,” he tried to say it with them but found that the word stuck in his throat. He adds that as he killed the king, he thought he heard a voice cry out: “Sleep no more, / Macbeth does murder sleep” (II.ii.33–34).<br>  Lady Macbeth at first tries to steady her husband, but she becomes angry when she notices that he has forgotten to leave the daggers with the sleeping chamberlains so as to frame them for Duncan’s murder. He refuses to go back into the room, so she takes the daggers into the room herself, saying that she would be ashamed to be as cowardly as Macbeth. As she leaves, Macbeth hears a mysterious knocking. The portentous sound frightens him, and he asks desperately, “Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood / Clean from my hand?” (II.ii.58–59). As Lady Macbeth reenters the hall, the knocking comes again, and then a third time. She leads her husband back to the bedchamber, where he can wash off the blood. “A little water clears us of this deed,” she tells him. “How easy it is then!” (II.ii.65–66).<br>  Analysis: Act II, scenes i–ii<br>  Banquo’s knowledge of the witches’ prophecy makes him both a potential ally and a potential threat to Macbeth’s plotting. For now, Macbeth seems distrustful of Banquo and pretends to have hardly thought of the witches, but Macbeth’s desire to discuss the prophecies at some future time suggests that he may have some sort of conspiratorial plans in mind. The appearance of Fleance, Banquo’s son, serves as a reminder of the witches’ prediction that Banquo’s children will sit on the throne of Scotland. We realize that if Macbeth succeeds in the murder of Duncan, he will be driven to still more violence before his crown is secure, and Fleance will be in immediate and mortal danger.<br>  Act II is singularly concerned with the murder of Duncan. But Shakespeare here relies on a technique that he uses throughout Macbeth to help sustain the play’s incredibly rapid tempo of development: elision. We see the scenes leading up to the murder and the scenes immediately following it, but the deed itself does not appear onstage. Duncan’s bedchamber becomes a sort of hidden sanctum into which the characters disappear and from which they emerge powerfully changed. This technique of not allowing us to see the actual murder, which persists throughout Macbeth, may have been borrowed from the classical Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles. In these plays, violent acts abound but are kept offstage, made to seem more terrible by the power of suggestion. The effect on Lady Macbeth of her trip into Duncan’s bedroom is particularly striking. She claims that she would have killed Duncan herself except that he resembled her father sleeping. This is the first time Lady Macbeth shows herself to be at all vulnerable. Her comparison of Duncan to her father suggests that despite her desire for power and her harsh chastisement of Macbeth, she sees her king as an authority figure to whom she must be loyal.<br>   Macbeth’s trepidation about the murder is echoed by several portentous sounds and visions, the famous hallucinatory dagger being the most striking. The dagger is the first in a series of guilt-inspired hallucinations that Macbeth and his wife experience. The murder is also marked by the ringing of the bell and the knocking at the gate, both of which have fascinated audiences. The knocking occurs four times with a sort of ritualistic regularity. It conveys the heavy sense of the inevitable, as if the gates must eventually open to admit doom. The knocking seems particularly ironic after we realize that Macduff, who kills Macbeth at the end of the play, is its source. Macbeth’s eventual death does indeed stand embodied at the gate.<br>  The motif of blood, established in the accounts of Macbeth’s and Banquo’s battlefield exploits, recurs here in Macbeth’s anguished sense that there is blood on his hands that cannot be washed clean. For now, Lady Macbeth remains the voice of calculating reason, as she tells him that the blood can be washed away with a little water. But, as Lady Macbeth eventually realizes, the guilt that the blood symbolizes needs more than water to be cleansed away. Her hallucinations later in the play, in which she washes her hands obsessively, lend irony to her insistence here that “[a] little water clears us of this deed” (II.ii.65).|`|TqA8l8dpaa	Macbeth has committed a murder and at this point is talking to Lady Macbeth about it.<br>  <br>  She says this in response to his nervous and guilty attitude.<br>  By saying "My hands are of your color" she means they are blood red, also, because she is just as guilty as he is.  When she says "But I shame to wear a heart so white" she means she would be ashamed of having such a weak heart as Macbeth is suffering from at that point.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://nfs.sparknotes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nfs.sparknotes.com/</a> for more help.

4G0Hb0TTaa	Montessori is an educational approach based on Maria Montessori's (Italy's first female doctor) observation of childhood development.  She believed that the traditional education did not provide appropriate support and stimuli for optimal development.  Her method is not only applicable to gifted children, in fact, she began her work with children with severe disabilities.  She opened the first children's house in the San Lorenzo neighborhood of Rome in 1907 and was featured at the San Fransisco World's Fair soon after.  Her method depends upon an environment carefully prepared for the child of the age that the classroom services and materials that allow the child to perform the work of their choice.  Montessori classrooms have a three-year age grouping (typically 3-6, 6-9 and 9-12). Today there are over 4000 Montessori schools in the United States.  While there are a great number of private Montessori Schools, there are also 200 public and charter Montessori schools around the country.   Montessori schools traditionally begin at age three, and some continue into adolescence.   I have attached a couple of sources that will give you more information on the topic.|`|AA10307482	It is a system used by some Private Schools.

Actually, proponents of the method claim it is right for any child.  I've recently learned about it and it really is an intriguing metod of educating an individual child based on his or her interestes rather than teaching to a group.  Many of the kids I spoke to seemed like they were well ahead of their peers in traditional schools.  IMO, that's not because they were smarter going in, but because the method allows them to enjoy learning.

i7GdZTLbaa	Sometimes it is best to just step up to the plate and deal with the main issue (they are below in no certain order):  <br>  <br>  1)  Why did you allow the 'F's' to happen in the first place?  <br>  2) Why are you a good investment (they pay their instructors to teach you and you blew it the last time) now ?<br>  3) Why weren't you before and why should they let you back in?  Personal issue aside - this is a maturity issue and you have to come across more mature than the person who didn't bother to withdraw.<br>  4) Why do you want to get back in the program?  This is important for you to reflect on as well - why do you want to get into this program again?<br>  5)  What is different in your life now and how will you handle adversity in the future if 'personal issues' crop up again - and they will -?<br>  <br>  FYI - one F does get you kicked out of any program so this is not something that is unusual - multiple F's usuallly will get you kicked out of the school/college/university regardless of the program - you should consider yourself lucky that you can appeal to be reinstated regardless of the board's decision.  Most places do not have this option.|`|AA10058115	All you need to do is tell the truth, and be honest and sincere in your answers.  The appeals board of a college is not there to beat you up - they are there to look out for the best interests of the college and the program. College personnel are quite used to dealing with unusual circumstances, and you may well find them to be open minded if, and only if, they are absolutely sure of your honesty and sincerity.

These are two of the best universities in the world. Penn ranked fourth (after Harvard, Princeton, and Yale)  in 2006 by US News, higher than Stanford's sixth. In addition, Wharton probably has a bigger domestic and international reputation than Stanford.<br>  <br>  Basically both of these schools are among the best, and both school's undergraduate business programs are among the best (Stanford's undergraduate business didn't make the top 25 because Stanford doesn't have a undergraduate business program).<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you. I hope you make it into both.|`|J36arjZeaa	All those schools are really good.  But where are YOU specifically going to excel?

No one but YOU can decide which school is "best" for you. Those rankings you refer to should be taken with a grain of salt. Undergraduate education is very similar no matter where you go to school. What you need to do is go and visit the schools you are interested in, ask questions and decide if that school is right for YOU. If you are still stuck between two or three schools, you can use rankings to make the final decision, but keep in mind that those rankings are made by for profit companies who are only interested in selling those lists to anxious kids applying to schools. In the end, the answer of which school is "best" comes down to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DjXzaHiqaa	Between Stanford and Penn, go with whatever school you liked better as far as where you'll feel most comfortable.  They're comparable schools.  <br>  <br>  Washington's a great school too, but not as prestigious as the others.  <br>  <br>  If you're definitely going on to an MBA program, Washington will still allow you to get into any MBA program provided you have a strong GPA and GMAT.  If you're stopping at undergrad and planning a career in a big corporation, look at the first two schools.|`|bHgpDAeVaa	Coming out of Stanford will look good on a resume for sure but its really who you know and what connections you make while in college.

d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	I want to remind the previous answerer that colleges are more discriminatory towards Asians than towards another other minority because of the number of qualified Asian applicants. On the one hand, schools commonly subtract 150 points from an Asian applicant's SAT score when making a decision regarding that application. On the other hand, other minority applicants usually get a bonus added to their SAT score when colleges evaluate their applications.|`|Z6Nuz5I1aa	Because, culturally Asians are driven to succeed. I think that Asian families put pressure on their children to go to college more. Also, I think that their is a perception that Asians are hard working and studious individuals. Therefore, maybe their is less discrimination against them when it comes to college admissions. This would also stem back to when Asians are in high school, and probably recieve better opportunites due to the perceptions that they are smarter.

AA10174149	you differentiate by understanding the meanings.<br>  <br>  in a nutshell, historic happened, historical is based on what happened.|`|5e6c15201d02b69c18743aadbdd0110daa	The two words are often used interchangeably, and both refer to things that happened in the past.   But when a distinction is made, then "historic" means that whatever happened was well-known or  important in history, whereas "historical" merely means that it happened, or that it somehow relates to history.   For example,  a "historical movie" may only be   about some event or era in history --like "The Titanic" or "The Three Musketeers"--  but a "historic movie" would be a movie that was important in itself --like, maybe, say, the first movie ever made.  <br>  <br>  Every courthouse contains historical records --that is, records about things that happened, like marriages and sales of real estate, but those records are only "historic" if they concern things of  importance --like, say, the Louisiana Purchase.   <br>  <br>  Everything in the past is historical, but only the important events are historic.<br>  <br>  The link below gives a good discussion.

nRAHzYUgaa	Consider a mathematical function defined by the formula y = 2x + 7.<br>  In function notation, you would write f(x) = 2x + 7.<br>  Function notation enables you to write simple expressions for other functions based on the one given.<br>  The derivative of f is written f', and its inverse as f^(-1).<br>  The value of y when x = 1 can be written as f(1). The value of the derivative of the function when x = 7 can be written f'(7), and the inverse evaluated when y = 3 can be written f^(-1)(3).|`|fcdff63e1dffe5e867c99c2ec348f1f3aa	Function notation is important because it limits the places where things on the graph can go.

3a77d41774e30da0cc8d8467fa5791e2aa	Using statistics, one could figure consumer optimization if you know the consumer base you're attempting to optimize.<br>  <br>  Example:  You run a local grocery store.  You sell chocolate cookies and vanilla cookies in a town of 100.  In a month's time, you have sold all the chocolate ones, and half of the vanilla ones.<br>  <br>  Optimization would occur when you would order to fit the consumer base.  You would therefore order twice as many chocolate cookies as vanilla ones so as to sell completely, all of the cookies before they became stale.
AA10771892	In a team meeting setting, the difference between training and coaching is, in my understanding, a difference of the degree of involvement with respect to the role of the instructor.<br>  <br>  In other words, an instructor first would be likely to "teach" meaning to provide the instruction itself, with the student being external to that process -- the teacher teaches, and the student learns.  Then, the instructor could go on to "train," meaning that the student begins to do what was taught, but the role of the instructor is now one of more interactive involvement, usually doing the action, and the student repeats it, side by side with the instructor.<br>  <br>  A learning situation can then graduate to a "coaching" mode, in which the student actually takes on the task, under the direct "coaching" of the instructor -- the student does the task, and the instructor provides direct feedback, but continues to allow the student to actually perform the task.<br>  <br>  Often, the next step is thought of as "support" in which the student is then considered to be capable to engage the task, and the role of the instructor is now to merely support the task in the event the student needs additional input or advice.<br>  <br>  The last step is considered to be "supervision" in which the student is entirely autonomous, and the role of the instructor is now one of supervision, supervising the outcome of the student's work performance and evaluating and providing feedback based on established expectations.<br>  <br>  So, I'd say it's a difference of degree or role of the instructor, with training being more of a hands on activity, of direct instruction, to provide the mechanics of proficiency, almost in a practice mode, and coaching being more of a hands off activity, with the student actually doing the work and the instructor observing and giving feedback, to coach the person toward greater proficiency.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!  :)|`|x5u1Al4raa	Training means you are doing practically what you had theoretically so the person who trains you is the trainer and you are the trainee.Coaching,in sport,means giving lessons of tactics and some other playing arts.|`|uYkHdr9aaa	tarining means they will give you knowledge as well as they will train you how to face problems.<br>  coaching means they will give you just knowledge.

After 1909 Matthew Henson never saw Akatingwah or his son again, though he did receive updates about them from other explorers for a time. His son Anauakaq, who died in 1987, arrived in the United States with Kali Peary, Robert Peary's son, on May 29, 1987, to visit his father's family and grave site. Anaukaq and his wife Aviaq had five sons who, in turn, had many children of their own who still reside in Greenland.

Your communication skills are important to maintaining those relationships that help you be healthy. How do you communicate? How often do you communicate? Do you initiate conversation?<br>  <br>  The people we interact with on a regular basis see you at your best and at your worst. You probably want a healthy overflow of those best moments. Communicating wisely and effectively can help you.<br>  <br>  No one likes to be offended and no one likes to be insulted. These are common sense statements, but it is amazing how often this is ignored. The usage of profanities in any conversation can be taken as insults at anytime. One of the best ways to avoid this mistake is to make a conscious choice to not use profanity.<br>  <br>  Insults can come in two forms, words and/or gestures. You can avoid a lot of problems by thinking before you speak. Choosing your words before sharing them may be all you need to bring a smile to someone’s face rather than a frown.<br>  <br>  Think about how you communicate. Sometimes the way you say something can mean the exact opposite of what you intended. Think about the message your body communicates to others.<br>  <br>  Crossing your arms can send the message that you don’t care or you can’t be bothered with the message being communicated to you.<br>  <br>  When was the last time you called that “best friend?” Part of communicating is taking the time to say I care by starting conversation and initiating the contact whether it be by phone, email or in person.<br>  <br>  Do you initiate contact with your friends and family? Do you call and share your thoughts and concerns? Sometimes it's up to you to make the contact and this is a healthy way of communicating to others that you care about them. Take the initiative to say that you care.

It can mean older people get inferior health care services or are denied access to other goods and services that many take for granted. <br>  In the UK health care is very age discriminatory, in part due to lack of adequate funding but it is common practice for 'older' patients to be refused treatment that a younger person will readily be offered|`|PoK2uOS0aa	When applying for a job either right after college or when making a job change in your fifties.

Offshore Earthquakes sometimes cause tsunamis, such as any major tidal wave you may have recently heard about. Hurricanes create horrendous storm surges (Very High Sea Levels) which can inundate low-lying coastal areas such as New Orleans...... Hope this helps.
gP8mF1Omaa	In Australia you can do law as an undergrad so the majority of graduates are aged 22 - 25.  I'll be 21 when I graduate if all goes according to plan.<br>  <br>  But there's no way that 29 is too old to start.  There's all these old people in my lectures aged from 55 upwards.  There's even a guy in his late 60's early 70's who's just studying law because it's something he's always wanted to do.<br>  <br>  The only problem you may have is after graduation.  Places in law firms are very competitive and if you're an older graduate they may expect you to have more experience than the younger ones.  However this is a concern for all graduates.  The best thing to do is apply early and try and build up as many contacts as possible.<br>  <br>  I would say at least 20% of students in my classes are over 30 and at least half of them would be over 50 so trust me, you're not too old!|`|ZJENnAJ2aa	Around 26|`|415f2987b46d4ae46d99da2553b83a73aa	most ppl go from undergrad straight to law school.

dXc2TXTGaa	I think what your teacher is trying to do is get you to write in the active voice and not passive and to get rid of "helping" verbs.

If you're say, taking Poseidon's point of view on the Odyssey, you want to condense the story down to a point where isolated incidents take no more than thirty seconds. If you're saying one particular myth, condense it rather less, and make sure you keep a few of those juicy details in.

ZdhvlgaOaa	Each has advantages and disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Public Schooling is completely free, allows the parents to work or participate in hobbies while the child is at school, allows a child to interact with a broad range of people from different backgrounds, and generally will have good sports and extracurricular opportunities.  However, depending on your district, public schooling may be underfunded and may be populated by unruly individuals.  Yet, ironically, the worse the school, the easier it will be for a talented individual to finish in the top 25% of their class.<br>  <br>  Private Schools are granted a presumption of offering a better education than Public Schools, although this is a broad stereotype that cannot be applied evenly.  For example, I grew up in a Midwestern community with excellent public education and the Private Schools were all religious schools for parents and students who wanted that experience.  A more accurate broad statement would be that Private Schools tend to offer smaller class sizes and more attention on the individual student - it is generally harder for a student to "fall through the cracks" than at a nearby public school.  Private schools, depending on their funding, may provide better or worse extracurricular opportunities than Public schools.  Yet, these opportunities may come at the price of a hefty tuition.  Lastly, Private Schools are not regulated the same as Public Schools which has both good and bad consequences.  The Private School can tailor the education to a set of beliefs (as in religious schools) and tailor the education to the student, yet also is not under the same scrutiny as public schools so is not as frequently inspected by outside authority for quality.<br>  <br>  Having never been homeschooled, I can only provide secondary knowledge on this option.  The biggest advantages to homeschooling are the ability to control the curriculum and foster the passions of the individual.  Because there is only one student (or a few students), topics of interest can be more greatly explored - if the student becomes passionate about British Literature, then this area can be tied into the entire English curriculum (e.g. learning about essay writing by writing about a British novel and learning about fiction writing by emulating a British novel).  This flexibility can improve the student's desire to learn and really focus the education around the student.  Yet, whether or not this is a good thing is debatable - because this is an option, there may be an eschewing of topics the student does not like very much, and hence important topics can be overshadowed (this reduces to the unanswerable question:  Is it better to train an artist through intense art study or by forcing him/her to learn physics, history, and music?).  Certainly homeschooling is the best option for individual attention, if that is of primary importance.  However, the ability of the homeschooled child to make new friends is a potential concern.  At a school with other peers, the student will be forced to develop a broad range of social skills that may not be developed by homeschooling (this is not to say they *cannot* be developed by homeschooling, just that they are not as integrated into daily life).<br>  <br>  <br>  In the end, the primary considerations are likely to be:<br>  1) what is the school funding like in my area?  are there a lot of private schools because of poor public school funding?  are neither the private nor public schools well enough funded to educate the student in the way I desire?  An easy way to check on this is to ask the local school district for the graduation rates, college attendance rates, average teacher salaries, and teacher attrition rates.  All of these should be available from a public school district and most should be available from an accredited private school.<br>  <br>  2) where will the student get the optimal balance between individual attention and socialization?  what will be the class sizes at the public and private schools?  does the school have a history of behavioral problems with students (could be indicative of administrative problems and failure to control the class size)?<br>  <br>  3) will the school allow the student to pursue his/her passions?  are there public "magnet" schools or specialized private schools in my area?  do the schools have extracurricular activities that excite the student?<br>  <br>  <br>  As someone who attended public high school, I found it was terrific for preparing me for college, both intellectually and socially.  Likewise, attending a prestigious private university prepared me very well for work and life beyond college.<br>  <br>  Of course the answer is a cop-out:  it really really depends on the individual student and the geographic location.  <br>  <br>  That said, if the local public schools are well funded and have adequate extracurricular opportunities, they are likely the cheapest and best for social preparation.|`|mXsebxvsaa	umm homeschooling.|`|ba1da1d90ffb73139e656d507d92f7b0aa	It really depends on the person but probley homeschooling becuase alot of people I no have been home schooled by there parents and when they have gone to public school (afterward)they are at least 1 grade smarter than there age group

4shKpyAiaa	If you owe money to one school, you can definetly start over at another. It's against your privacy for the new school to contact your old school for anything, even a transcript. It is up to the student to get all that information. The only bad thing is if you had credits that you wanted to transfer from the old school, you would be required to bring in an official transcript. Since you didn't pay the balance you owe, most likely you won't be able to receive it. But if you are planning to just start all over completely, you shouldn't have a problem. The new school will only be concern if you pay your tuition at their school. Also, when you apply for school, they don't do a credit check to pull up your credit report nor do they do a credit check when you apply for a Federal Stafford Loan so there is no way they will know if you paid off your balance at the old school or not. It's not their concern.|`|56a70b5e2e60948364fd290462445132aa	Why not? <br>  If you owe money and the charge is less than a year old - chances are the new school won't even know about it (may not make it to your credit report on time)

You will need a text of some sort - newspapers work well - with the text enlarged and if there are pictures include the pictures.    Enlarge the print so that everyone - even old, tired eyes - can read it comfortably.  Have about 20 or so copies.  You will underline certain words and the only rule is that the reader cannot read what is printed on the page - they have to insert a synonym in place of the word.  <br>  <br>  The purpose will be to build fluency while focusing on meaning making while reading ALOUD together.  So allow no more than 3-4 seconds pause for the substitutions to take place then resume reading.  After the first hesitation and push forward everyone will catch on and move through them quite easily.  If someone asks what will happen if they can't think of a work tell them to make a guess and continue.  I would tell them this before trying the strategy.  I might have ready several articles of varying degress of difficulty.  <br>  <br>  Because everyone will be in the same boat - they all have not read the text before hand - they will each say something different for some words.<br>  <br>  For example:  The word underlined in the article might be the word "home."  Possible substitions are almost endless and include the following depending on where you live:  house, condo, apartment, hut, dorm....<br>  <br>  This takes maybe 5 minutes max.  Simple, fun, and moves everyone towards fluency and comprehension.
i7GdZTLbaa	I'm assuming that the feedback included both strengths and weaknesses.  I would take an honest appraisal of the comments and the coursework that it is linked to and ask yourself the following questions:<br>  <br>  1)  Do you understand what the feedback means intellectually (vs. the emotional gut reaction that the teacher/boss, etc. is an idiot because of whatever!)?  <br>  <br>  2)  Do you agree with comments or parts of the comments?  If so, in what ways do you agree? <br>  <br>  3)  Are there any comments that you don't agree with and why don't you agree with it?<br>  <br>  4)  Do the suggestions/comments change the meaning of the assignment such as move you off of your stance or your views in a writing assignment?  If it is an exam that is T/F or multiple choice can you find the question answered differently in the texts, notes, etc. than what the test asked you?  If so then go in and talk to the teacher during their free time and not during class time so they can explain why your answer is not right to you.<br>  <br>  critical feedback is a part of life but critical feedback may not be accurate or true or right.  The situation and the project (test, presentation, whatever) dictates that and you have critically think about the feedback for yourself.

i7GdZTLbaa	There are many things that are positive about small group in learning environments.  In fact most people learn more in small groups than in large groups.  If someone doesn't like them then they haven't experienced a small group that works well.<br>  <br>  1)  Small groups allows and enables shy, hesitant learners to more fully participate in the learning engagement.<br>  <br>  2)  Small groups enable the teacher-facilitator to observe all the students interactions with their group members.  <br>  <br>  3) learners actually learn by talking, sharing, and investigating with more experienced others in the group.  Since no one comes to the classroom with 'perfect' knowledge (this includes the teacher) there will be some learners who are more knowledgable than others in the classroom and can collaborate with others in the learning engagement.<br>  <br>  4)  English language learners don't slip by the wayside or through the cracks as they might in large group instruction.  Small groups tend to get these new English language learners more involved and may make them more comfortable so that they can ask questions without reprisals or embarrassment.<br>  <br>  5)  The teacher can observe at a distance or up close each group to observe what needs to be modified or adjusted.<br>  <br>  6)  Small groups are great, but they work best with some (not a lot) of large group time as well.  The large group time should be like debriefing after  a large meeting or sales call - what happened in each group, what questions did they raise, how did disagreements with regards to interpretation get remedied, and any problems that they are having as groups.  Brainstorming possible solutions by the whole group of learners is often helpful because other groups may have dealt with the same issues in new ways.<br>  <br>  These are my main views about the positive aspects of small group learning situations.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|45df770cc1ffaa5b703b1506af4ca9c0aa	SLC's can provide all the things you listed as well as what the education gurus (goodlad, wood, meir etc.) call indiviudalized instruction. There is an artical about the SAGE program in Minnesota that discusses the pros v cons of this issue. I looked at this for one of my research papers for my masters degree and the findings are what I consider expected. Yes SLC's if they operate correctly are great and can offer indiviudualized instruction IF the teacher changes the way he or she teaches. Simply reducing the class size or changing the demographics in the room doesn't improve the instruction.|`|oObE1ujnaa	There's nothing positive about small learning communities.<br>  They suck.<br>  I'm sorry.

(I.e., don't pick Purdue-West Lafayette over Indiana-Bloomington).  Most of your major state universities will have good political science programs, or you can go to the first guy's theory and get an expensive private school education.  I know that I had professors at Illinois regularly going to Springfield or Washington to consult with politicians about issues, and actually making a difference in the world.<br>  <br>  That said, different specialties in political science could result in wildly different qualities for the same school.   A school could be great at American politics, but be awful in international or comparative or political theory.  If you have a preference of specialty, look into the specialty.<br>  <br>  And finally, remember that schools increase class size in financial crunches.  I don't even want to know how big some of my lecture classes were at Illinois (okay, in theory the auditorium only holds 1200).  And political science is one of the fields where they may just pack'em in like sardines.

Since technology is playing a large part in treatment these days, a knowledge of engineering is becoming highly sought after by med school admissions boards.|`|i7GdZTLbaa	Great  question and it is wonderful that you want to be a doctor.  If I am not mistaken a civil engineer is someone involved in building things such as bridges, roads, transporation systems and the like vs. mechanical engineer (the way things run such as engines, etc.) vs. chemical engineering which is focuses on chemicals, compounds, etc.  This is a really basic level of description - probably not specific enough for the engineers out there - and I am not an engineer.  <br>  <br>  Things to consider:  <br>  <br>  1) is your undergrad/graduate work GPA stellar?  if not begin to take courses that will apply to med. school such as biology, zoology, etc. that will help you raise your grades.<br>  <br>  2)  where do you want to live?  apply to the medical schools in the area where you want to live.  <br>  <br>  3)  Your background will be a plus in that you will have the basic science, math, and technology already built into your background so it won't be like being a humanities major rather than a science major.<br>  <br>  4)  what type of doctor do you want to be - family practice, researcher, internist, orthopedic surgeon, .....?  That dictates also where you apply.<br>  <br>  5)  Go to the American Medical Association web page and explore their site - get used to it as it will be vitally important to you.  Here is the URL:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ama-assn.org</a><br>  <br>  One of the tabs near the top is medical schools and licensure.  This will give you a lot of information.<br>  <br>  6)  which medical school can you afford?  cost is important.  You need to figure out your finances before you apply because if you apply to a really competitive program and don't get scholarships you may also not be able to attend even if you get accepted.<br>  <br>  7)  if you are married or engaged then you need to make sure that your family and future family are all onboard completely.  Graduate school is tough and it is hard on marriages.  I don't know the stats myself but in Ph.D. programs out of the field of medicine the survival rate of marriages is less than 50%.  You will be immersed in the field of medicine working often 72 hrs. straight without time off and without seeing your kids, wife, husband, etc.  Be sure that they can do without your immediate presence - especially as you go into residency.  <br>  <br>  Now, is it possible?  Yes!  But as with every choice in life there are consequences and sometimes the consequences are unknown until you in the thick things.  Be sure to talk to MD's to get the inside scoop especially those MD's that are recent graduates.  Ask the hard questions so that you don't give best case scenarios to your families.  Don't sugar-coat your thinking and don't give your families only the 'best case' scenarios but give them - to the best of your knowledge - the worst case ones so they won't be surprised, disillusioned, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you flunked a test go to the prof and ask for help on the concepts that you know you missed.  Then see if you can build up your other grades in the course to offset this one test.<br>  <br>  If you got a 55% you earned that grade - this does not mean it was well taught or that you didn't study.  Figure out why you got the 55%.  Be proactive - take charge of your learning - and understand that no matter how well it was taught or how hard you studied the test didn't access your knowledge enough to pass it.  Now maybe this is an accurate measure of your understandings for the exam and the test but you are disappointed and this seems to speak to thinking you can do better (implied).  If you don't think you can then re-evaluate your major.<br>  <br>  If this is a job performance rating then work with your employer in much the same way.

AA10926886	There are many universities with interdisciplinary Masters and doctoral programs these days. <br>  <br>  I've included a link below which lists many (but not all) such programs in the US. (For example, it omits the Hum. Doc. program at Syracuse.)<br>  <br>  You should know, however, that the huge problem with an interdisciplinary degree at the graduate level is that graduate study is all about specialization and subspecialization. Therefore, it is practically impossible to get hired anywhere in academia with a "freestanding" interdisciplinary degree. Freestanding interdisciplinary programs are generally "cash cows" for universities, as they usually do not provide assistantships or fellowships, so students most often must pay for them on their own.<br>  <br>  A Masters degree in "Liberal Arts" is generally a degree pursued by students who are studying only for their own personal growth, and not for qualifying for any sort of employment. Such a degree will certainly not help one to gain admission to a doctoral program in any discipline.<br>  <br>  I've known a few folks with interdisciplinary "hum doc" degrees (doctoral degrees in "Humanities"), and the only jobs they've found are in libraries and archives.<br>  <br>  If your specific intended work is truly interdisciplinary in nature, it is still usually best pursued under the auspices of a traditional department, especially if you are planning to seek employment in academia after you earn your PhD. Most doctoral programs are sufficiently flexible to allow for coursework outside of the department, and many programs require at least one dissertation committee member from outside of the department. <br>  <br>  Just a few words of caution and advice, which I hope you will receive in the proper spirit.<br>  <br>  I should add, however, that many universities offer "area studies" or "regional studies" doctoral programs under the auspices of certain departments. These are usually very highly regarded degrees, and they are almost always departmentally-based rather than freestanding.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	If you are looking for superb interdisciplinary programs, then look at the University of Pennsylvania.

OGXCESdQaa	A sentence needs to have at least two things:  A noun & a verb:  The dog barks.  Since the question uses the word "always," narrow down your choices by getting rid of what you don't always need in a sentence.  In this case adjectives and adverbs. <br>  <br>  So, lets focus on verbs.<br>  Think about how you'd use your "every" words in a sentence.  For instance:<br>  "Everyone participates in class for credit."<br>  <br>  Now let's look for examples that are singluar (one person) and plural (more than one person):<br>  Singluar/One:  "Kayla participates in class for credit."<br>  Plural/Two:  "Students participate in class for credit."<br>  <br>  The verb for Everyone matches the singular case that we used wtih Kayla.  So the answer for Everyone is A:Singular Verb.<br>  <br>  You can test the other two in a similar manner.<br>  <br>  I believe that these types of nouns are "indefinite pronouns."  Maybe you could try searching this phrase for more info.<br>  Hope this helps.

3BBwy0Gvaa	USually a 14 year old is put into the 9th grade which is the Freshman, first year of High School.  Unless, he's been left back or is way behind in his work ability then he can be placed in a Middle School in either the grade 8 or 7, but not any lower than either of those two.<br>  New York City has 5 boros, so I'm not sure if you're meaning the boro of Manhattan or any one of the other 4 boros.  If he wants to specialize in any one or two subject areas, then if I was you and him, I'd do research on the computer and google search for High Schools in N.Y.C. and find out which of them offer what he's looking to study and learn about.  (I recommend that you do a computer search on High Schools no matter what you're looking for and then you'll have a whole bunch of choices to pick from.)<br>  You said something to do with average work, except I didn't fully understand  what you meant by that term in this instance.<br>  Are you referring to him getting average work or him needing average work?  Anyway, make sure that if he's on an average level within his grade's work, then the teachers and guidance counselors understand this and abide by it.  If he only has average or below average capabilities then as his parent, I wouldn't worry so much about him getting into a specialized school.  Your focus point should rather be on his improving within his goals he most likely will accomplish within the school year 2007-2008.  A lot of times a student who is "average" can be avg. in one or two subjects and above average in all other areas.<br>  As the incoming school that will be accepting your son's application for enrollment, they will have to know his past educational background as well as what country he's migrating from and his primary language.

2Bm21FFJaa	$247 on cash terms means the store keeper marked the item $260 but gave the buyer a 5% discount.  5% of $260 is $13.  So the buyer paid $247.  Since the seller marks his prices up 30% before selling that means th product he is trying to sell for $260 he really only paid $200 for.  So if the seller paid $200 and ended up getting $247 from the buyer he made $47.  This is a 23.5% profit from the $200.|`|c9d515821e3d51ce36f823dcff61f7fbaa	25% I think.<br>  <br>  On a side note- If you really need help with your math homework, I would suggest getting extra help with your teacher.|`|h72LLIY7aa	i uh...i think if you don't do it yourself you will never ever learn and besides how do you know if the person who answers you are right? ciao!|`|AA10305912	Always take an example with hundered as the base, so that calculation is easier. <br>  <br>  So as per the problem,<br>  If Cost =100, profit is 30 dollars, so sale price is 130<br>  if cash basis with 5 % discount, <br>  Sale Price =130, Discount is 5 % so New sale price is <br>  130 - [( 130 *5)/100 ]. = 130.00 - 6. 50 = 123.50<br>  If the Cash sale is 247 then what is the profit and Cost.<br>  Use the reverse calculation<br>  <br>  a. Cost of the Product :<br>  If 247 = 123.50 what is X = 100<br>  so ( 247 * 100 ) / 123.50 =  24700/ 123.50 = 200.00<br>  <br>  b. Profit of the Product :<br>  Sale - Cost = 247-200 = 47 dollars<br>  <br>  So Profit %= (Profit / Cost ) *100 = (47/200) *100 = 23.50%

I live in the state of NY, so Cornell and NYU are big.

Top Ivies that take transfers such as Harvard, Yale, Penn, and Columbia have transfer admission rates of less than 10%, and they usually only take students from other prestigious schools. However, Ivies such as Cornell and Brown take more transfer students.<br>  <br>  If you don't already attend a prestigious school, then I would recommend that you apply to Cornell and Brown.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

If you have the drive and the mind to succeed, you will make it happen.<br>  <br>  Fill out a FAFSA, and apply for scholarships.  Visit web sites and request information from schools you are interested in attending.<br>  <br>  I am currently in the process of transferring as well.  I assume that an Ivy League school would be a great deal of hard work, both in the process of being accepted, and in the actual quest of obtaining a degree.  But, if you are aware of that, and it's still something you feel driven to accomplish, go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck...  :-)
U6YnCjBraa	Like you, I have always found science to be interesting, sometimes even fun.  A year ago, I had to decide on what I wanted to study as I started my first semester of college.  I'm a mechanical engineering major at Clemson, and I still don't know whether that's what I really want to get my degree in.  I'm five years ahead of you and I still don't need to know what I want to be when I 'grow up'...If your only a freshman, you've barely touched the surface of basic science.  Wait until you have taken Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, before you decide what you want to do.  Keep in mind that if you end up hating one of these subjects, that does not mean that there isn't a scientific career out there for you.  Try going to www.myroad.com and researching careers.  Its for students like you who are in high school and want to check out what they could do with an education in a particular subject.  I wish you good luck, but also implore you not to try to decide what you want to do with your life yet.   Go out and enjoy life.|`|AA10764321	A scientist is a very broad term encompassing a very wide range of proffesions and jobs.

Talk to people you know to see if there are any openings where they work.  Believe it or not, many employers, depending on the type of work and size of the company would just as soon interview someone on a personal recommendation than go through the process and hassle of posting a job opening and dealing with a bunch of people- it is very time consuming.
F5aT7iSjaa	I would say that getting an AA degree is the best way to go until u figure out what you want to do exactly... <br>  I have alot of friends that went to CC and took care of their general ed. classes while they figured out what they wanted to do... the counselor is there to give u advice and suggestions...<br>  there are some ppl that take a yr off after HS to do other things than college to figure things out also...<br>  it's what u feel u need in order to figure things out.|`|ghjoJ94Qaa	Yes this is probably the best route, if you have no idea what you want to be yet.
r9AC9uY1aa	hi astro,     <br>  concerning your question :may is modal auxiliary which is used with another verb to express permission or possibility,for example:may i use your hair-drier? or,take your umbrella,it may rain today.may must be followed by infinitive.maybe is an adverb expresses possibility,for example:maybe it will be warmer tomorrow.maybe is somehow similar to the adverb "perhaps".and may be  equals may.finally,might is also modal auxiliary in the past form as you said ,but it is in the form of the past not in the meaning.might expresses ,also,possibility and permission and of course as all the modal auxiliaries ,must be followed by an infinitive.<br>  hope this will be useful for you ,and iam ready to answer all your questions|`|846d283d106d429d92e3ca14a2f18231aa	well, if u wanna use d word may, you could ask "How may I help you?" if for maybe would be, "Maybe, you are right"  for may be would be, "We may be getting to know each other" and might would be, "I might be able to help you on this". i hope that this may be of use to you. good luck!|`|b06ac1949031958ad2aaad3f523869d4aa	u can read more books(about grammar,vocab,etc.).|`|cc91cb4b3d143352d579bc1ce6e95b9caa	Might can be used as a NOUN meaning strength, power, or force.  "He fought the battle with all his might."  "I will fight this tempatation with power and might."     (This MIGHT be the other meaning you were talking about. - Here might is used as a form of the VERB may.)    Yes, may and may be are both verbs, but maybe is an ADVERB.  Adverbs work with verbs:  "Maybe Astro will like the movie."  It means, How will Astro like the movie? Maybe!  "Maybe Astro sings like a star."  Astro sings - maybe!  I think the other examples from others will answer your questions about may and may be.  (You could not use may or may be in the same sentence as maybe.)

This is where you go to get a 2-year degree (an 'associate' degree).<br>  <br>  There are a lot of jobs that don't require four years of training.  Dental assistant.  Welder.  Electrician.  Computer technician.  Auto mechanic.  Bookkeeper.<br>  <br>  Today the term 'junior college' is considered obsolete.  They're usually called 'community college'.  They're very easy to get into, usually you can get in with just a high school diploma--or even without one if you can pass a test that shows you speak English well and have simple basic skills.  They serve as a resource to the community.  You don't even have to be a full-time student, you can go at night to take a few classes to further your career or learn hobbies like photography or ceramics, or just use the library.<br>  <br>  A lot of people who don't have the grades in high school to get into a good 4-year college will start at a community college.  They can get a lot of their general education classes out of the way, then transfer to a 4-year school based on their grades at the community college.|`|e7abe4f2819a53be9c2c1ceb3a9dad61aa	A Junior college is a 2 year college that is usually public and you can get a 2 yr associates degree or get your basic level course you need to then transfer to a 4 year university. these colleges also provide vocational course for you to add to your resume.

Avoid the temptation to read the thin , exam -oriented books . <br>  2. In the 1st and 2nd years, concentrate on getting your basics right .Worry about the exam scores latter . Especially  important are Physiology , pathology  and Pharmacology . <br>  <br>  3.Apply ! Apply ! Apply ! Don't just mug up !<br>  <br>  4. When you start your clinical postings , avoid the temptation to bunk ( as cliched as it may sound) . And remember to read about what you see in the ward everyday . <br>  <br>  5. Use your pre-final year ( ENT , PSM and ophthalmology ) to strengthen your weak areas(from 1st and 2nd year subjects ) and start reading seriously for the final year subjects . The work load during this year is relatively light and gives  you ample time to cover at least 2 subjects thouroughly . <br>  <br>  6.Use your internship year wisely . You should utilize this time intensively for your p.g preparation<br>  <br>  Suggested reading<br>  Anatomy : Chaurasia , Snells and Clinical Anatomy( forgot the author m but it's an indian author ) <br>  Histology: Di firoes <br>  Embryology : to study: Langman's , For exams : Inderbeer Singh <br>  <br>  Bio chem: Satynarayan , Lippincotts <br>  <br>  Physiology: Ganong Or Guyton <br>  <br>  Pathology: Robbins Basic pathology ( No need for the Big Book-<br>  <br>  Pathological Basis of Disease  )<br>  <br>  Phrmacology : Kd.Tripathi , Clinical Pharmacology-Bennett and brown , Lippincotts <br>  <br>  Microbiology : Arora <br>  <br>  FMT: Parikh <br>    <br>  Hope this helps !|`|sbI7wlLNaa	u can prepare by gathering knowladge liberary and reading may book

There are no 100% rules as to how the language is put together.  As soon as rules are given the list of exceptions begin.  This is the case with both the contractions in the question.  You would not say, "why can not we say: why did not you talk to me?"  The n't denotes the negative of can and did.  Like when someone says to me, "That's the best answer I've ever read . . . NOT !!!<br>  So in short, it's not the same thing like jelly and jam aren't the same or are not the same thing.|`|42db97a5ee1e5ab7e44edff916ce3297aa	The first sentence correctly would be: why did you not talk to me, not why did not you talk to me.|`|9F6tncCXaa	You can say "Why did not you talk to me?", and people used to talk that way a hundred or so years ago.  That's why the contraction "didn't" exists.  It's just considered old fashioned.<br>  There's no strict grammatical rule for where to place the negative in this case.  It's a matter of custom, and custom has shifted over time.

AA10409407	I am an x-ray tech. The difficulty depends a lot on the students background, there are some tougher science courses like anatomy and physiology and radiation physics. But if he has any background in sciences this will be easier, our class of 30 only graduated 19. It is generally a two year program, longer if you count the prerequisites that  quite a few programs have added. There are also a few technical courses that teach you how film developing machines work and such, even though most hospitals are digital now. The job can vary a LOT. I worked on a military base for a while and that was great mostly young healthy patients. But then I worked a level 1 trauma center, old people that can't get into the positions you need to get the shot, new doctors making you re-shoot cause they didn't know what they saw.  Most of the patients don't have broken bones the docs are just covering their posterior by ordering an x-ray to be sure. Then you have parents of children being x-rays- wanting to hold their crying child while you are trying to shoot, then asking why there had to be so many. Doctor orders them, you just have to shoot them. Even if you can tell by the way the child is flailing that its not broken. Pay is excellent though. I have never gotten paid less than $25/hour and if you specialize in CT, ultrasound, or nuclear medicine that can easily double or triple, especially if you travel. I definitely wouldn't say its easy, there are a lot of people to try and keep happy. It can be rewarding but usually you don't see the reward unless you follow up with patient, but generally thankless. Oh and the national certification test to practice is VERY difficult. Let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to answer them. Don't let those that don't know sugar coat the medical field, you will just be unhappy in the end.|`|4MG6TtVVaa	I am not an x-ray tech, but I can tell you that x-ray tech or anybody in nuclear medicine is in super high demand!  Pay in a small rural community like mine (in which a large chunk of town was directly effected by the increase in the minimum wage) is $35k+ for starters it seems.  As to rewarding?  I know I wouldn't want to go to work to do x-rays on people who are often in pain, but that's just me.  The pictures he takes helps heal people, which has got to be a coping mechanism.|`|sMH6AY9haa	Taking classes for X-ray Tech is a good thing he will be highly needed. Classes would be on scientic and human body. He would learn how to use the machines and how to get the best results. Tell me to always be nice and helpfull because people who go to x-rays are pretty badly hurt. Tell him not to think about dating because tech school run on a pretty fast paces and he will need to give all this awaking time to studing. But after they place him at a job then he can start looking for dates. Yes it is an easy and rewarding job.

AA10409407	Which ever major will get you the best GPA. You can major in anything then just take the required Biology, Chemistry, Organic chemistry and Physics. GPA and MCAT(Medical Collage Admissions Test) are the BIGGEST factors in acceptance in admission. A lot of medical schools want "diverse" students so they have been choosing more and more liberal arts and humanities majors. Choose something you can excel in. A 4.0 in Liberal Arts beats a 3.2 in Biochemistry every time, unfortunately. <br>  As for colleges if you chose a college that has a medical school also, you have a good chance of getting accepted there, as long as you do well. But more importantly is that you can succeed at the school you choose so you may be better off going to a smaller university if you can get better grades in smaller classes.<br>  Plastics is a competitive field so you will also need to do well in med school to get a surgery residency and then get a fellowship in plastics.
AA10409407	Medical school is a graduate school you attend after receiving your 4 year degree. Admission is competitive so do well in your undergraduate studies and on the MCAT (medical collage admissions test) and then apply. First you need to complete your Baccalaureate degree.
DWvqjjp9aa	No. You do not need to work in a pharmacy to get Certified. What you want to do is research schools in your area that help prepare you for the PTCB exam. (Pharmacy Technicians Certification Board).  The program really shouldn’t exceed 9 months and they should offer internships with local pharmacies. If a program doesn’t offer an internship do not waste your money. This will help getting your foot in the door.<br>  <br>  The exam is not hard at all just a lot of memorization and math. If your not good at math don’t fret, there are formulas and tricks to help you . If you were able to pass algebra in high school then you can do the math on the exam. <br>  <br>  In a pharmacy a technician does the technical part. They prepare and dispense drugs under a pharmacist. This can range from counting pills for a specific prescription or shooting drugs into an IV bag that will eventually be given to a patient. If you have anymore questions about the exam or what a technician does go to     www.ptcb.org    .|`|AA12005289	Wouldn't recommend becoming a Pharmacy Tech, my mom went to school to become one and has not found a job in 3 years of applying to pharmacies all over the state, nor can her classmates find jobs.<br>  <br>  The Pharmacy Tech test isn't easy, but if you study it a ton then you'll do fine.<br>  <br>  Not sure how long it took to get certified.|`|AA10409407	I have seen programs anywhere from 16 weeks to 2 years. It can be hard for some people but most of the test is basic math skills (mainly calculating drip rates) and basic medical knowledge. I passed the National Certification Exam easily on my first try, but I sat next to a girl who was going on her 7th attempt!! If you are nationally certified that is usually all you need to get certified in your state, along with paying a fee and often a background check. Working in a pharmacy definitely gives you an advantage on the test because you have been seeing the drugs everyday, but the programs out there are getting better at exposing students to common drugs. Let me know if you have any other questions. :)<br>  PS I don't know why anyone would not be able to find a job as a pharmacy tech, I was a military dependant so I lived all over and was able to find positions in 6 different states always within 1-2 months of moving there.

Although this is not much other shool systems especaily in the larger cities pay up to 47,000.  It all depends on wgo that school system you want to work for.  If you want a more percise answer, log onto to different cities in VA and go to schools web pages.  (Some cities are goochland, hanover, henrico, hopewell, colonial heights, petersburg, chesterfield)  The schools web page will contain a spot for job openings and a salary scale.

Honestly, if a woman were to have Barbies exact body and measurements, she would have to be 6'9" tall.  Really, how many women do you see that are that tall?  <br>  <br>  I really think girls, no matter what age they are, should be happy with who they are.  When a girl sees Barbie and all the clothing that goes with it, they may think that, that is how they are supposed to dress and look like.  <br>  <br>  But it can go the other way too that Barbie is just a doll and by a girl playing with her she is using her imagination by her making up what Barbie is doing, wearing and so on. |`|XOYDAJdFaa	I had hundreds of Barbies growing up and as far as I can tell they have had no negative effects on my self esteem.

oZAM0s2Taa	Hula (IPA: /?hu?l?/) is a dance form accompanied by chant or song. It was developed in the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesians who originally settled there. The chant or song is called a mele. The hula dramatizes or comments on the mele.<br>  Legendary origins<br>  There are various legends surrounding the origins of hula.<br>  <br>  According to one Hawaiian legend Laka, goddess of the hula, gave birth to the dance on the island of Moloka?i, at a sacred place in Ka?ana. After Laka died, her remains were hidden beneath the hill Pu?u Nana.<br>  <br>  Another story tells of Hi?iaka, who danced to appease her fiery sister, the volcano goddess Pele. This story locates the source of the hula on Kaua?i, in the north shore valley of Hā?ena.<br>  <br>  Another story is when Pele, the goddess of fire was trying to find a home for herself running away from her sister Namakaokaha'i (the goddess of the oceans) when she finally found an island where she couldn't be touched by the waves. There at chain of craters on the island of Hawai'i she danced the first dance of hula signifying that she finally won.<br>  <br>  American Protestant missionaries, who arrived in 1820, denounced the hula as a heathen dance. The newly Christianized ali?i (royalty and nobility) were urged to ban the hula — which they did. However, many of them continued to privately patronize the hula.<br>  <br>  The Hawaiian performing arts had a resurgence during the reign of King David Kalākaua (1874–1891), who encouraged the traditional arts. Hula practitioners merged Hawaiian poetry, chanted vocal performance, dance movements and costumes to create the new form, the hula ku?i (ku?i means "to combine old and new"). The pahu appears not to have been used in hula ku?i, evidently because its sacredness was respected by practitioners; the ipu gourd (Lagenaria sicenaria) was the indigenous instrument most closely associated with hula ku?i.<br>  <br>  Ritual and prayer surrounded all aspects of hula training and practice, even as late as the early 20th century. Teachers and students were dedicated to the goddess of the hula, Laka.<br>   <br>  Hula is universally known as primarily a Hawaiian dance. It was featured prominently in the Walt Disney movie, Lilo & Stitch.Hula changed drastically in the early 20th century as it was featured in tourist spectacles, such as the Kodak hula show, and in Hollywood films. However, a more traditional hula was maintained in small circles by older practitioners. There has been a renewed interest in hula, both traditional and modern, since the 1970s and the Hawaiian Renaissance.
vP2dkd7Iaa	Like all things that are difficult, you have to be dedicated to do well.  The SAT is the same way.  Any Joe Shmoe can go in blah there way through the test and get an okay score.  Getting a 2400 takes a lot of time, money and resources.  You have to be willing to research what the essay readers are looking for so that you can write an essay that answers the question and doesn't follow the lame 3 bullet essay taught to high schoolers when they are freshmen.  In the math and verbal section, you have to have a solid understanding of both subjects-above and beyond the general knowledge catergory.  You also have to remember that there is an "experimental" section on every SAT.  It isn't scores, so feasibly someone who gets a 2400 on the SAT may have still missed some questions.    <br>  <br>  Also, the SAT penalizes you for incorrect answers and the answers are all weighted based upon the difficulty of the question.  So unlike the ACT (based upon the number of correct answers), the SAT factors in incorrect answers and how hard they are.  I suppose that makes it harder too because I would think most people would rather skip a hard question and do 3 or 4 easy ones in that time that they know they can get right.  That way instead of wasting time on points you won't get, you can do the easy ones and at least get a few points.  Once again, causing fewer 2400 scores.|`|b6b30e5dbaa0c133dc8bee37f4337866aa	They make sure the SAT is hard enough so that very few people ace it.  If it were common for people to make a 2400, how useful would it be?  They'd have to have some other way to weed out all the people with the perfect scores.|`|MxYRJucAaa	It probably has to do with their curving system, and how much they deduct for wrong answers. For example, sometimes they'll allow you to get a question wrong and still get an 800 on a section. Other times (if they want to make it harder), a single wrong answer will cost you a lot more than your second wrong answer. <br>  In short, the trick is all in how they play the statistics game.<br>  <br>  Also, do you know for sure that the number of perfect 2400s isn't in the double digits? I'm pretty sure they are.<br>  Another thing I just thought of - the essay on the writing section is completely subjective. There doesn't seem to be much reason behind the scoring of it, and its the only section graded by people rather than a machine. This may contribute to not getting a perfect score out of 2400.|`|a644dffd498b5902cf6e338cefac6912aa	You try taking that damn test. If you mis bubble your in out of it. If your tired and add incorrectly your out. <br>  <br>  The test is LONG and RIGEROUS. and you can easily mess up. <br>  <br>  Have you ever taken a test like this ?

If kids could take all day to do it and could take long breaks in between each section, there would be tons of kids who would get 2400s. The fact that it's a solid 4 hours with only a couple tiny little breaks makes it much harder, so that even really smart kids mess up when they get tired.|`|zR4lYjlDaa	I thought I was smart...

First, it is an action verb, expressing a doable activity like kick, want, paint, write, eat, clean, etc. Second, it must have a direct object, something or someone who receives the action of the verb.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples of transitive verbs:<br>  <br>  Sylvia kicked Juan under the table.<br>  <br>  Kicked = transitive verb; Juan = direct object.<br>  <br>  Joshua wants a smile from Leodine, his beautiful but serious lab partner.<br>  <br>  Wants = transitive verb; smile = direct object.<br>  <br>  Cornelius painted the canvas in Jackson Pollock fashion, dribbling bright colors from a heavily soaked brush.<br>  <br>  Painted = transitive verb; canvas = direct object.<br>  <br>  Alicia wrote a love poem on a restaurant napkin.<br>  <br>  Wrote = transitive verb; poem = direct object.<br>  <br>  Antonio eats lima beans drenched in brown gravy.<br>  <br>  Eats = transitive verb; lima beans = direct object.<br>  <br>  Pinky the poodle cleans the dirty supper dishes with his tongue before Grandma loads the "prewashed" items into dishwasher.<br>  <br>  Cleans, loads = transitive verbs; dishes, items = direct objects.<br>  <br>  Important note: When no direct object follows an action verb, the verb is intransitive.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  First and foremost, a transitive verb is an action verb. Second, it requires a direct object to complete its meaning in the sentence. In other words, the action of the verb is transferred to the object directly.<br>  <br>  To determine whether a verb is transitive, ask whether the action is done to someone or something. Does the subject act upon someone or something? Or put another way, does someone or something receive the action of the verb. If it does, then the verb is transitive and the person or thing that receives its action is the direct object.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the following examples, the transitive verb is bold and the direct object is underlined.<br>  <br>  The judge sentences the man to five years in prison. <br>  The subject (the judge) applies an action (sentences) to a direct object (the man).<br>  <br>  <br>  The attorney has revealed the bad news. <br>  The subject (the attorney) has transferred an action (revealed) to a direct object (news).<br>  <br>  <br>  The defendant could not provide an alibi. <br>  The subject (the defendant) will transmit an action (could provide) to a direct object (an alibi).<br>  <br>  The direct object can be found by asking a question about the action:<br>  <br>  The subject did something to WHOM?<br>  <br>  <br>  Prosecutors charge people. <br>  The knife's sharp edge cut the chef. <br>  Law enforcement had previously convicted the man. <br>  Prosecutors charged him under a habitual offender statute. <br>  Authorities are incarcerating repeat offenders.<br>  <br>  <br>  The subject did something to WHAT?<br>  <br>  <br>  The jury deliberated the case for 48 minutes. <br>  The technician made a joke. <br>  A local woman is seeking a seat on the city council.<br>  <br>  Passive voice can hide a transitive verb because the subject is not in the sentence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Learning to identify the subject and object can help you avoid passive voice construction and help you identify a "hidden" transitive verb.<br>  <br>  A man was given a sentence of 25 years to life under California's "three strikes and you're out" law for stealing a cell phone.<br>  <br>  <br>  Presumably a judge sentenced the man; therefore, THE JUDGE is the subject, GAVE is the verb and the MAN is the object. It can be better written as:<br>  <br>  <br>  A judge sentenced a man to 25 years to life under California's "three strikes and you're out" law for stealing a cell phone.<br>  <br>  <br>  A substantial amount of the nation's street crime is committed by a small number of bad actors.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here the subject is actually in the sentence and the power of the verb is weakened by passive voice construction. <br>  It can be better written as:<br>  <br>  <br>  A small number of actors commit a substantial amount of the nation's street crime. <br>  <br>  A NUMBER is the subject, COMMIT is the verb and AMOUNT is the direct object.<br>  <br>  Whether written in the passive voice or corrected for a stronger sentence, the verb is transitive.<br>  <br>  --------------<br>  <br>  Transitive Verb <br>  A transitive verb is an action or linking verb that has a complement. <br>  <br>  Dictionaries consider all linking verbs transitive. An action verb which is transitive has a direct object. The action is being done to something or someone. <br>  <br>  <br>  In most dictionaries the abbreviation v.t. means "verb, transitive." <br>  <br>  Most verbs can be both intransitive and transitive depending on the sentence. <br>  <br>  <br>  Intransitive: He runs around the block daily. <br>  (There is no direct object.) <br>  Transitive: He runs a large corporation. <br>  (The verb runs has a direct object, corporation.) <br>  <br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  Here Is a lot of info on them I hope this helped!<br>  I always hated doing grammar in school :/|`|WoQwxabXaa	1. intransitive verbs<br>  <br>  Aliens exist.<br>  <br>  Adolf Hitler has been dead for over 64 yrs.<br>  <br>  The 20th century has been a time of great advances as well a time of awakening to human capacity for savagery.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. transitive verbs<br>  <br>  Aliens must have superior knowledge and advanced technology just to make the trip spanning at least 30 light years.<br>  <br>  Adolf Hitler sent a warning to non-Axis Western countries that they are no better than the Semites he was persecuting in that they have become soft by humanitarian values.<br>  <br>  The 20th century has many historical lessons for posterity which are not to be forgotten; never again!

yXmUEBNkaa	You need a PhD to be a Psychologist.  You absolutely have to go to med school to become a Psychiatrist.  One big difference between the two is that Psychiatrist can prescribe medication, and you absolutely MUST go to medical school for this.  Psychologists don't go to med school, but they do need to get a PhD - doctor of philosophy, which, depending on who you ask, may be harder than med school.<br>  <br>  You need a master's (in general) to be a school psychologist (depending on the school district, you may need a PhD for this as well) or social worker or something like that.|`|oW4xX5okaa	Psychologists (therapists) are not doctors of medicine. They do not go to medical school. Instead they go to college for 4 years to study psychology, and then go to graduate for another 4 years to get their PhD.<br>  <br>  A PhD literally is a doctor of philosophy. This is the highest degree one can obtain through higher education studies. Getting a PhD is required if you want to become a personal therapist.<br>  <br>  A psychiatrist is a doctor of medicine that has specialized in the field of mental health. A psychiatrist must go to college for 4 years, then medical school for 4 years (to obtain their M.D., medical doctorate), and then do a 4 year residency in psychiatry at a hospital. After all this has been completed, they can practice on their own. They are able to prescribe medications to patients as well as counsel them. A therapist can only counsel patients.<br>  <br>  Psychiatrists have a much greater salary than regular therapists do, but the schooling, training, and workload is more time consuming and stressful for the psychiatrists.|`|107405bbcdb915439a0fd322a6701663aa	you do not need to go to med school to become a therapist or a psychologist. you would get your bachelor's degree (4 yrs), and then get a masters degree (usually 2 years) in the type of therapy you want to practice- Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), School psychology, Social Work (MSW), etc.  A phd is an advanced degree past a masters- a doctorate- and you can get a ph.d in psychology, sociology, social work, philosophy, etc- generally 4 years of grad school.<br>  I was always under the impression that you did have to go to med school to become a psychiatrist. the main difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist is that the psychiatrist can prescribe medication and i think you need to go to med school to do that. but i just got in an argument with my friend the other day about this, and she insists that you don't, so i can't say for sure.|`|vjooN5jHaa	to be a therapist YOU DONT NEED TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOl. youll need a degree in any subject (usually psychology) and then do a masters in therapy which will qualify you for practicing therapy at a clinic :)<br>  <br>  for psychatry YOU NEED to go to medical school, 5 years at medical school then 2 years as an intern and then specialise for psychatry which will be a few more years :)
4DkJ31yMaa	you have a great chance! Don't stress! Make sure u put a lot of time into studying for the GRE. Those are important because some schools weigh scores alot more than gpa. As for college park, I go there and I know that Maryland prefers high test scores. But you are looking very good. What kind of master's are u looking into?|`|AknuDK1vaa	your chances ant bad.|`|0Di7f74raa	Ofcoarse u will hav a chance just keep on trying 2 achieve what u want.<br>  =>)|`|i7GdZTLbaa	From this information no one can tell you an accurate answer because you don't know your GRE score.  <br>  <br>  You're GPA is good.  Letters of recommendation are good.<br>  <br>  Things you've got going for you are:<br>  <br>  Economy is bad and there will be fewer applicants for the openings in the programs.  Less competition always ups your chances.<br>  <br>  Out of state tuition will dictate that at last 2 states you would need to factor that in (assuming you are not 'living' in all 3 states which would difficult to do as your income tax forms would indicate where you live - only 1 state allowed, I believe) .  <br>  <br>  Some other factors that may or may not be important in their evaluation of your records/application:<br>  <br>  <br>  You don't have 2 years experience working post-bachelors degree.  Most graduate schools require this but not all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Assuming that you score about 1500 or higher on your GRE would mean that you meet the entrance requirements of most Research 1 schools (of which all 3 schools are ranked high in that category).  What a research 1 ranking does for a university is that they are university research sites - they are actively conducting research in most programs offered on a campus).  This means that the cream of the crop of grad. students & those that do apply at these schools will probably have a higher grade point average than you do but this is not always true.<br>  <br>  So do you have a chance - Yes.  <br>  <br>  But I strongly recommend working for a couple of years to payoff any undergrad. bills/loans and then to gain work experience.  <br>  Your background experiences seem to support your work.  You will be heads and tails above many other applicants if you work first and go to school later.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  I'm not trying to dissuade you from applying.  Rather just trying to give you some insight into the academic institution side of things.
RDehYxmUaa	A little help with revision, this is just a few ideas, I like your speech it is cute, even though I actually liked the books:<br>  <br>  Good morning/ Good Afternoon audience, I would like to tell you the truth about Harry Potter and its effect on many innocent lives. Harry Potter is a leading contributer to the downfall of our younger generations.  Author J.K. Rowling is forced into suppling millions of readers new and newer editions. The books also create stress for teachers. _______would have finished her handwriting yesterday, but she was consumed by Harry Potter and the Order of the phoenix! _____ was doing her words when announced that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone would be available at local bookstores. Emma Watson tripped at school and suddenly Ms. Bonacinas classroom was full of cameras!!! And that’s only the beginning! The spells told inside this book can warp young minds when placed in the wrong hands.<br>  <br>  For example, the curse Crucio could be used to frighten young children, giving them nightmares and unneeded stress. Young impressionable minds everywhere are sitting on their sofas screaming "Accio" trying to summons their dinners. The Harry Potter series has also managed to eliminate millions of trees without even uttering the words "Avada Kadavra!" And you must admit it was very disappointing when you and your friends didn’t receive an invitation to learn at Hogwarts!<br>  <br>  Therefore, unless you want to contribute to the problem and fuel the Potter fires, less put a stop to the madness. But down the fake wands and the Potter glasses, pick up the t.v. remote , and watch some good ole' fashioned tube. Thank you for your patience as I give you the facts and I wish you a Harry Potter-free day.<br>  <br>  Of course my version of your speech is dramatic and slightly sarcastic, but I still like your idea. Even boring speeches can be fun and entertaining when given the correct mood.|`|RoBFa4SZaa	What is wrong with you!!!!!!<br>  I don't know what you want to convey in this speech....<br>  It's boring and very confusing...<br>  I really don't get it!<br>  <br>  <br>  HARRY POTTER RULES!!!!!!|`|1DMMlLe8aa	Here's a revision. Not exactly sure what you were looking for, but I polished your work a bit. Your last two sentences are confusing, I suggest you either rewrite or delete them.<br>  <br>  Good morning/ Good Afternoon Mr.__ and fellow students. I am here today to tell you the truth about Harry Potter and how, over the years, the story has changed many innocentlives. If Harry Potter didn’t exist, the world would be much better. J.K Rowling would spend her time doing the dishes and watching TV, but instead the poor woman is pushed to write enough books with enough pages to circumvent the Earth. Not only does this problem affect the author, J.K Rowling, but it also creates stress for teachers. _______would have finished her handwriting yesterday, but instead she sat down to read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix! _____ was doing her words when it was announced on the radio that Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone would on the TV that night. Emma Watson tripped at school and suddenly, Ms. Bonacinas classroom was full of cameras!!! And that’s just the beginning! The spells told inside this book are very dangerous.|`|oZAM0s2Taa	Yeah, but what on earth does the speech have to be about?

1pSjluFCaa	bueno la verdad no solo ha sido uno solo, por ejemplo me acuerdo de mi profesora Adriana en la primaria, era muy paciente y creativa y con ella aprendi a leer y a escribir( hacer las cuentas basicas). ??Gracias a ella ???pude leer mi primer libro; Despues tuve un profesor  llamado Jose Guadalupe Sanchez  y medio Ciencias naturales en la secundaria, es que hace más de 10 a?os no daban las materias separadas no como ahora ense?an Quimica , fisica, biologia todo eso lo daban en una sola. recuerdo que èl nos hacia conciencia del medio ambiente y era muy agradable, nunca nos grito. Y otro más que recuerdo es el maestro de Historia pero anivel universidad te platicaba la historia,  pero bien padre, que hasta gusto te daba aprender y leer; con èl nunca  fue de dejar un resumen o hacer cuestionarios; como me  habian hecho ver en la secundaria, ???por eso odiaba  la historia???, pero con él era  como hablar de algo muy preciado. De hecho nos dio en el ultimo nivel de la carrera un recorrido turistico en Teotihuacan y hasta los americanos que iban de visita se nos pegaron  a nosotros.La verdad es que nunca se le ha reconocido o dado un merito a los buenos  profesores ( no a los olgazanes que siempre faltan , mucho ojo) por  su trabajo, su dedicación y desempe?o.Los que verdaderamente se preocupan por la juventud y la educación en Mexico, pero estos profes te puedo decir con orgullo que  llenaron mi vida de herramientas con las cuales he salido adelante con  mi familia en este momento, que bueno que realizaste esta pregunta porque me diste la oportunidad de decirles ???gracias???|`|4KteClJeaa	Yo recuerdo a mi maestra Josefina de la Rosa en la cd. de Matamoros además de mi maestra lo fue de mis hermanos era muy rega?ona pero una gran maestra.|`|JrnpqQHqaa	A mi maestro de primaria se llama Miguel Lopez Portillo estuve con el los seis a?os de primaria y  tenia paciencia para los alumnos|`|LYGAwrKhaa	Hola!<br>  <br>  pues yo a la maestra de espa?ol se llamaba peggy bueno asi le deciamos, pero se llamaba adriana....<br>  <br>  era muy buena y me ponia 100?<br>  <br>  era super?|`|lzLU1toRaa	Recuerdo a mi prof de Quinto Grado de Prim. era su primer a?o como profr, era muy joven, recien salidito de la normal, asi que traia a flor de piel el amor a los ni?os y a la carrera, lo recuerdo perfecto Jose Luis Briones Pineda, se gano la admiracion, resperto y amor de todos. <br>  Tenia asma y un sobrepreso muy grande, tres meses terminando el curso, fallecio, en verdad fue muy triste, pero lo recuerdo con mucha alegria.|`|vFOl6n33aa	yo, a mi primer maestra, ya que me dio clases durante tres a?os consecutivos, fue la que me dios todas las bases de lo que ahora se, ademas fue como una segunda madre para mi ya que siempre se preocupaba por todos, ahh y a mi profesor de matematicas del cole, por que siempre se dba a entender de una facil manera, y nos ayudaba cuando teniamos problemas con otras materias|`|76b717393dcfa55772f967c79f726b65aa	A mi maestra de espa?ol de la secundaria

AA11838937	 My son was the same way. He started speech therapy at age 2 and was in a program until the 5th grade. It didn't seem to improve his speech very much and some of the exercises where torture on him. However at the 3rd grade he was assigned to a wonderful teacher. She and him became friends, I think she was a little shy herself. It wasn't the speech she taught that helped my son it was her ability to coax out some self confidence from him. Perhaps you may not be so lucky to get a teacher like his but it is important to know that the speech will come after he gets self confidence.|`|uzYnw1vEaa	I don't see what the question is.

QNObnVODaa	Wouldn't bloods,be a contraction of blood samples?<br>  When I have blood tests,the GP usually fills 3 or 4 phials.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	Blood as a substance has no plural, as many have said. But there are different types - human, cat, dog etc. and within those there are sub-types, such as (for humans) O, A, B, Rh+, Rh- etc. Therefore, someone in a laboratory or hospital where they have different types could talk about "a variety of bloods".<br>  Your doctor could have been taking different types of sample, for example in tubes with and without anti-coagulant, so he could arguably be correct in saying "bloods".|`|dovVcDPmaa	Could be that the sample of blood taken would include various organs or different parts of the body that the blood shows a difference- hence the plural.<br>  <br>  You do not have to have English as a second language.  I have always accepted this 'bloods'. so thank you for the Q.  Interested to read the A..<br>  <br>  Do not be ashamed of being ignorant,  don't ask - don't get.

They also want you to be civic minded and well rounded.  You will need to participate and succeed in extra curricular activities.

I would, however, go to him and apologize.  This would let him know where you really stand and that you don't usually speak this way.  Additionally, he would probably respect you a bit more.  Good luck!|`|ODedx7t4aa	If he didn't say anything, he probably doesn't care.  If he was going to do anything about it, he would have done it by now.  Also, if you're wondering what he thinks about you personally, you're going to have to ask because he'll never just volunteer the information.  He may also not want to talk about it as a matter of principle.  You should be fine as long has he's not said anything to you about it thus far.|`|0tHYQHY7aa	That would depend entirely on your teacher. I taught 2nd graders and if I would hear them say a word like that, I would caution them on those kind of words.It sounds like you are in an older grade so you probably know better than to say those kinds of words. If it was your first offense then your teacher could overlook it, but if you have been heard to say those words before he just might do something. Then again, it is not like you did a big horrendous act though. Like I said in the first place, it is up to your teacher and what kind of person he is. If he has not done anything yet then he probably won't do anything. Teachers know that they should discipline at the first sign of wrong doings. At least they SHOULD know that.

She now lives in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. Powers became the last living female veteran on March 27, 2007, with the death of 109-year-old Charlotte Winters from the USA.<br>  <br>  The following is a list of known surviving veterans of the First World War (July 28, 1914 – November 11, 1918). The total number of participating personnel is unknown, but there were an estimated nine million military casualties during the conflict.<br>  Veterans, for this purpose, are defined as people who were members of the armed forces of one of the combatant nations up to and including the date of the Armistice. Other WWI-era veterans are listed separately. This policy may vary from the policy in actual use in some countries.<br>  111-year-old British WWI veteran Henry Allingham, born June 6, 1896, is currently the oldest living verified veteran. Emiliano Mercado del Toro of Puerto Rico (August 21, 1891 – January 24, 2007), who died aged 115, is the oldest authenticated veteran, from any conflict, to have ever lived.

Why? --read:<br>  The term fruit has different meanings depending on context. In botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary—together with seeds—of a flowering plant. In many species, the fruit incorporates the ripened ovary and surrounding tissues. Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate seeds. In cuisine, when discussing fruit as food, the term usually refers to just those plant fruits that are sweet and fleshy, examples of which include plum, apple and orange. However, a great many common vegetables, as well as nuts and grains, are the fruit of the plant species they come from. No one terminology really fits the enormous variety that is found among plant fruits. Botanical terminology for fruits is inexact and will remain so.<br>  <br>  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed by Congress and then signed into law by President George W. Bush on August 8, 2005. Under the new law, Daylight Saving Time begins three weeks earlier than previously, on the second Sunday in March. DST is extended by one week to the first Sunday in November. The new start and stop period begins March 2007.

F2Fi0TAYaa	The Monroe Doctrine is a U.S. doctrine which, on December 2, 1823, proclaimed that European powers would no longer colonize or interfere with the affairs of the newly independent nations of the Americas. The United States planned to stay neutral in wars between European powers and their colonies. However, if later on, these types of wars were to occur in the Americas, the United States would view such action as hostile. President James Monroe first stated the doctrine during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress, a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States.In what came to be known as the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, Roosevelt asserted that European nations should not intervene in countries to the south of the US, however under certain conditions, United States intervention might be justified.

SxIx9ilpaa	I taught my little ones by first making sure they knew what each letter was by letter recognition, then taught them their letter sounds by singing each letter and the sound they made.  Then, after they knew what each letter looked and sounded like we would march to the "vowels"... yeah sounds corny but it worked.  <br>  <br>  All the while of teaching this I would read for myself my own books, and each night (sometimes all day if they wanted it) I would read to them and when I read to them I always pointed to the words.  Once they knew all the sounds I would start sitting your little one on your lap and read a book with them, when you run across an easy word such as "cat" have them sound it out.  The first time they read it correctly make a very big deal, kids love positive encouragement, if they get it wrong, that's fine just work through it with them and keep going like no big deal.|`|i5tOQGgFaa	I'm assuming that this child knows his letter sounds if you are at the point of "stretching" the word.  Maybe this will help.  We've been using this book called Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons by Siegfried Engelmann...and having great success with our 5 year old.  One of the things that I like about it are the visual cues.  They use a black dot under each letter that makes a sound and if the letter is silent they print it smaller than the rest and do not have a dot underneath.  They also underlined the word (with a dot at the left side) with an arrow pointing to the right.  The child starts with his finger on the left side of the arrow (on the dot) and then traces the arrow and stops at each dot to sound out that letter/sound.  Then they say it "the fast way" running their finger from the left to the right and blending the sounds together.  Good luck!|`|lDoH5L7vaa	Focus on practicing with sounds.  You can do a bubble gum game where you pretend to be chewing some gum.  Then pretend to stretch out the gum as you are saying the word slowly.  Ex:  ggggguuuuuummmmmm.  If he is having problems remembering the sounds, then you need to focus more on the sounds and practicing with them--- you weren't too specific in what he's having trouble.  Hope this helps.  Practice makes perfect.|`|AA11459087	Most kindergardeners don't know how to read yet.  At that age "reading" is saying your ABC's, recognizing individual letters, matching same words, being able to spell your own name, pairing capital letters with lower case, etc.  Kindergarden sets the baseline for 1st grade (where he will learn to read).<br>  <br>  You can help him along the way with his letters by going on a scavenger hunt.  Take turns looking for things that begin with certain letters.  <br>  <br>  Another game is "I Spy".  I do this with my kids a lot.  You say "I spy with my little eyes something that is green (or whatever color).  They try to guess.  You can play this game anywhere.  We do it most while driving down the road.  It not only occupies their time but  will increases vocabulary skills.  Just don't forget to let your son have his turn!  LOL<br>  <br>  There is a neat little website called www.starfall.com that he may enjoy.  It is interactive.  I think most of this will be over his head but it is kind of like playing a video game while learning how to read.  It will read to him.  As I'm sure you know, reading is memorizing so have fun with it.<br>  <br>  Remember, you son will get it.|`|KrfQe1Qtaa	Do you mean to pronounce each letter?  Or syllabication?  Either way, you need to check to see if he knows the sounds of all the letters.  Once that is achieved, point to one letter at a time while he sounds it out.  After all are sounded out several times, begin putting the sounds together to read the word.  Next, teach him the syllables and how many there are ex. cat - 1 Syllable   (note- put your hand under your chin and show him that your jaw drops one time when you read the word because it has only one syllable).  Now that the word is read, he needs to see it and read it all the time to develop fluency with his sight words. (Sight words are words that he will see often in text that is intended at his grade level. You can find them online or ask the teacher). I hope this was helpful!|`|iWZbOLbwaa	what do u mean stretch the word? give examples

E0UUsKdnaa	who, what,where,when,why,which potrebbe anche esserci how|`|KDjMfYFbaa	La cosiddetta regola delle 5 W è una pietra miliare dello stile giornalistico anglosassone. Le cinque W stanno per:<br>  <br>      * WHO<br>      * WHAT<br>      * WHEN<br>      * WHERE<br>      * WHY<br>  <br>  che sono considerati i punti irrinunciabili che devono essere presenti nella prima frase (l'attacco o lead) di ogni articolo, come risposta alle probabili domande del lettore che si accinge a leggere il pezzo.<br>  <br>  La scelta delle particelle interrogative è arbitraria -- non tutte le particelle interrogative in inglese cominciano per W. Viene enunciata in questo modo per motivi mnemonici, ma sicuramente anche eufonici (l'inclinazione dei popoli anglosassoni per questo tipo di effetti è documentata sin dalla letteratura antico inglese, che conta svariati componimenti in poesia allitterativa).<br>  <br>  La regola è quindi un comodo promemoria per chi, dovendo accingersi a scrivere un pezzo, è facilitato nel raccogliere le idee e/o a non scordare informazioni essenziali: ad esempio per chi deve trasmettere rapidamente informazioni (pensiamo al cronista sportivo al telefono con la redazione durante la partita), ovvero deve superare il comune blocco psicologico definito popolarmente “sindrome del foglio bianco”.<br>  <br>  Il cronista, in generale, la utilizzerà liberamente, integrandola con altre informazioni o eliminando quelle non essenziali o irrilevanti al soggetto: ad esempio, per un resoconto di costume generalmente si risponde anche alla domanda “HOW” (come), descrivendo l'evento; per contro, in un articolo di cronaca nera, rispondere alla W di “why” (perché) è principalmente compito degli inquirenti, ed il cronista ne riferirà in seguito se le indagini avranno avuto successo.<br>  <br>  L'utilità della regola è pertanto quella di aiutare a sintetizzare al massimo le informazioni importanti, all'interno di uno stile conciso ed essenziale qual è, ad esempio, quello dei “lanci di agenzia”. Per un articolo più lungo, o qualsiasi altro resoconto, possono costituire uno scheletro intorno al quale far crescere l'esposizione: non è raro per gli insegnanti di lingua consigliare ai propri studenti di partire da queste semplici informazioni per i loro scritti.|`|UbShYILtaa	when , wich , what , where , how ,why.|`|rc9kNKaXaa	who, what, when, where, which, how|`|swgASp7oaa	which programme are you watching?<br>  <br>  which is the capital of italy,rome or milan?|`|AA10384735	which = quale|`|4bbIxhuyaa	ciao...ci sono le 5 w che sono: who what why when where...<br>  poi ce ne sono molte altre, come which...

Nowadays we use it to mean that sometimes you feel a certain way about something, even though you know in your brain you can't say why exactly you feel that way.  Pascal actually meant to make a more subtle point about religion.  He thought that a heartfelt religious belief underlay the proper rational approach to figuring out what moral forces would guide our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Try this link, but DON'T just copy the text,  because you will get caught!  It's from a book called  Philosophy and Living, by Ralph Blumenau, and you need to give credit to Mr. Blumenau if his writing helps you understand what Pascal was saying.  Your teacher will appreciate that you did research, but only if you give credit to the author whose work helped you!

vYNOotEMaa	Strategic importance of Cuba is that the USA has had a long historical connection to Cuba.  We "freed" it from Spanish rule in 1898, Spanish American War.<br>  <br>  When Fidel Castro took over, and brought Communism there, it threatened the USA, because it was a back door through which the Soviets could infiltrate the whole Western Hemisphere, and put medium range missiles there threatening the whole USA mainland.<br>  <br>  Kennedy's blockade of Cuba, in 1962, got the missiles out, but the USA hasn't established diplomatic, or trade relations with the Castro regime.  Our govt still tries to isolate Cuba.  But millions of Cubans live in Florida area, waiting for their time to return there.  <br>  Perhaps we don't want them to go back?  It may harm the USA economy in Florida too.<br>  <br>  The Middle East has been basicly a French and British "Sphere of Influence". But, with the establishment of Israel after WWII, the USA has a big interest in the area, because of the strong Jewish voter influence in the USA.<br>  <br>  Also, now, with petroleum being so important, we cannot allow those who are unfriendly to the USA to control the supply of oil from the Middle East.<br>  Besides that, after  9/11 and the attack on the World Trade Centers, the Middle East was seen as a hot-bed for terrorism.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, one of the biggest suppliers of our oil, Saudi Arabia, was the place where 19 out of 21 9/11 attackers came from.  Which means that we overlook the hostilities of Saudi people, to keep access to their oil.<br>  <br>  President Bush's preemptive strike against Saddam Heisein was a big mistake, because we've seen that it has made the entire area unstable, and forced the USA to spend 400 billion dolllars, and caused a huge price increase in world oil prices.  Our economy is suffering from this disaster today.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great Olympics in China this year.

That is a bad sentence, as it should actually be "has been disputed."<br>  <br>  In the second sentence, the subject is "virtue" and the verb is "are."  Again a bad sentence, the verb should be "is."<br>  <br>  In the third sentence, the subject is "fondness" and the verb is "render."  Wow, all these sentences were bad.  The verb should be "renders."<br>  <br>  Each of your sentences has a singular subject (truth, virtue, and fondness), so each sentence needs a singular verb (has been disputed, is, renders).

AA10176626	Unfortunately, the answer to your question is "no". Your dependency status is not based on whether your parents actually contribute to your educational expenses - it's based on whether your parents should reasonably be expected to contribute. <br>  <br>  This is a very common source of confusion for first time financial aid applicants, because they hear the term "independent" and assume that this "independence" is the same as it is in the dictionary - you know, like "on your own". "My dad isn't going to give me money for school, so I guess I'm independent". Unfortunately, that's not true.<br>  <br>  "Independent" is used for financial aid purposes in an entirely different way - and the definition is established by the federal law that administers the financial aid program. <br>  <br>  By law, you are only "independent" for financial aid purposes if you can answer "yes" to at least one of the following questions:<br>  <br>  Were you born before January 1, 1985? (next year, it will be 1986)<br>  <br>  Are you married, as of today?<br>  <br>  Are you an orphan, or a ward of the court?<br>  <br>  Do you provide more than 50% of the financial support for a child?<br>  <br>  Do you provide more than 50% of the financial support for a non-child dependent who lives in your home?<br>  <br>  Are you a current, or retired member of the US military?<br>  <br>  Next year, they will add a new criteria - the question will be "Have you been declared an emancipated minor by a US court of law?"<br>  <br>  Unless you can answer "yes" to one of those questions, you will be classified as a dependent student for financial aid purposes.<br>  <br>  Note a few things - it doesn't matter if your parents give you money. It doesn't matter if your parents claim you as a dependent on their tax returns (that's a different kind of dependent). It doesn't matter if you live on your own. It doesn't matter if you file your own taxes. It doesn't matter if you have a good job. It doesn't matter if you intend to pay your own way in school. <br>  <br>  Independence is not a status that you apply for if you're going to be on your own.<br>  <br>  The underlying principle is that the student and his/her parents are primarily responsible for the high costs of an optional college education. The federal government (meaning the taxpayers) will help families that NEED help, but not families that don't want to pay for higher education. If the government offered extra aid to students whose parents didn't want to pay for college - just how many parents would voluntarily pay for college?<br>  <br>  Spend some time with this booklet - it's a US Department of Education pamphlet called "Funding Education Beyond High School: The Guide to Federal Student Aid". You'll discover that you do qualify for federal financial aid - no matter how much your parents make. Yes, that aid will come in the form of access to the Stafford Loan program, but you'll learn why that's a really good deal. Remember, if you prudently borrow to finance your education, you are making an investment in YOUR financial future. The expectation is that your education will qualify you for a great job - which will provide the income to repay the loans.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. Sarah, the information you are giving is completely wrong. Please contact me if you'd like more information.|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	You can do your FAFSA as an independent student, but your parents cannot claim you as a dependent and you'll still need their signature for any loans as a cosigner. Your parents probably still want the money for you as a tax deduction, so if you plan on going that direction, plan on moving out totally and supporting yourself. That would be difficult, but possible.<br>  <br>  Another option is to write a letter after financial aid packages are distributed, to your financial aid counselor. Explain that your parents don't plan on helping you out and you really need more aid even though "technically" you don't qualify. You may get a little more in loans than you want, but it would be better than not going. <br>  <br>  Yet another option is to go to community college for a few years and save up money to transfer, or just attend a four year school at home. <br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!|`|rE0Zyopaaa	I had the same problem when I was in college. I was basically on my own. I had to get student loans and I also worked. It is very doable but tough. If you want it bad enough you can do it. <br>  <br>  I have 26k in student loans currently but I now make 60k a year and I did it all on my own. It will be hard for you to get a pell grant but I do not see a problem getting a subsidized or unsubsidized student loan.  <br>  <br>  I am living proof that it can be done. I highly recommend going to a community college for two years b/c they are cheaper and the core classes are little easier being smaller groups then the huge university ones. I was able to pay for my own community college working regular job. Plus it will prepare you little better for the Universities. <br>  <br>  It is also easier to get a scholarship from community college then it is a University. 
Ic6Fyszgaa	Quite possibly, yes.  It really depends on the courses you are referring to. If they are for incoming freshmen and transfer students, then no.  Most likely for courses that are normally taken by incoming freshmen, they don't usually fill up with continuing students (students who are currently registered).  <br>  <br>  Yes, it is preferred to submit your application as early as possible since sometimes colleges limit the number of students they can admit.  For example, if the college can only accommodate 5000 students, once they reach that limit, they could very well not accept any more applications.  Also, there is a possibility that the earlier you apply and are admitted, the earlier you may be permitted to register.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|oQUq25hVaa	I don't know how universities go through their applications, <br>  I think it's like getting your film into a festival early, before the deadline. <br>  <br>  For film festivals, they begin the process of reviewing applications as soon they start coming in the door.  And when the team has more time to review them, the team is less stressed, and your application probably has a better chance of a fair review. <br>  <br>  So yes they absolutely fill places before the deadline.  They will not fill "all" the places in the university because still, some super-interesting candidates will come in at the last minute.<br>  |`|i7GdZTLbaa	Yes, they can but normally they don't.  They want to leave themselves the opportunity to choose the best candidates for their program.  Then there is the 'false advertising' issue...  so they need to keep at least one spot open or their recruiting brochures/info would be false - erroneous.  This would mean that they could be sued.  Programs in universities - unless it stipulates something like if opening remain by XX date... will have at least one spot open on the deadline date.<br>  <br>  That said here are some other things that could be playing into the 'early as possible scenario':<br>  <br>  1)  Logistical issues - theirs:<br>             they hire faculty to teach these courses so the sooner  they meet minimum program numbers for courses to "go" the sooner they can recruit stellar faculty members available to teach the courses.  <br>  <br>  Normally faculty are recruited about 6 months in advance of the start date to the course.   For example, now the profs for the courses taught in the spring semester (Jan-May)  but in March faculty will be recruited for fall (5-6 months ahead of the course).  <br>  <br>  These aren't normally a problem for universities with waiting lists for their programs but it might be.  <br>  <br>        Logistical issues - yours (possibly)<br>  <br>       the sooner they get your application the sooner you will know if you are not accepted.  This would enable you to choose the school of your choice from your remaining schools <br>  <br>  or to know if you are needing to move to do the program then getting an early admittance to the program would be beneficial.<br>  <br>   So there are benefits to getting your application in early for the university and for you.  <br>  <br>  One more thing... it is always less of a flood of applications early in the application window than near the deadline.  Most EVERYONE sends their materials in near the deadline so you have a little less of a chance when there is a flood of applications.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of the process regardless of the wording of the call for applications.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  |`|V20LAlDwaa	Your question is a bit unclear, but, yes, they may fill a course before applications from new students are processed.  Current students sign up for the next semester several weeks before the end of their current semester.  Freshmen are often placed in courses with little or no input from the student for their first semester and can make changes if necessary and if the courses they want aren't filled by upperclassmen.  Freshmen are "last in line" as far as registering for courses at most schools.<br>  
i7GdZTLbaa	Hard to tell what the app.  stands for but if your payment has not been received you need to see if it cleared your bank.  If not then you need to call the college (??) to see if they received it and are holding it for some reason.  If they didn't and it hasn't cleared the bank put a stop payment on it and resubmit another.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you applied before they applied the payment to your account - not in order of submission but that you didn't allow enough days to elapse before submitting your application.<br>  <br>  A phone call to the place might be in order just to make sure you find out what is really going on.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	You are screwed!|`|f16b77fef2b905e82f3abcd10530f9c1aa	HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHuh
LoEtpxsNaa	I loved high school because I was surrounded by friends I had grown up with, was in every extracurricular activity that existed and hanging out consisted of talking/playing games/watching movies etc...<br>  <br>  College is better than high school because you have all the freedom you want. No passes to go to the bathroom... no getting in trouble if you skip class... And you get to choose your own class schedule to a point. But, it takes a little longer to make new friends (true ones) it seems that getting drunk is the thing to do, so if your not interested in that it kinda sucks... but if you look real hard you can find little groups that just like to hang out. <br>  <br>  So I would right now high school because I miss my friends... but I would never go back or want to relive it. I love being in college and growing up, and making big steps to my future. |`|GDobAMQ8aa	I don't have strong feelings about high school.  The people (with few exceptions) were ok.  The schools were ok.  *shrug*  However, I was home schooled for the last part of my senior year (as well as all of Freshman year), and I learned much more that way; I also enjoyed not having to deal with ignorant asshats everyday.<br>  <br>  I really have enjoyed college.  I love the people I've met.  I love my professors.  I love the classes.  I love the freedom of it.|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	I have a very similar answer to Terrified By Spider's.  I'm thinking there's  a correlation between high school biting and college taking longer than average to finish.  In fact, it's a fact.<br>  <br>  In college, you are more independent, you have leeway as to the classes you want to take, and if you were unpopular in high school, you usually come into your own in college.|`|y9iBhTMraa	high was boring for me. im in my second year of college and i love it. its fun and its not that hard as most people say but i guess it depends where you go. you have freedom away from your parents and can do whatever you, most of the time|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	Was in choir in both, met some great friends!!!! went on great trips, too.  was in musicals,  had a blast with both!!!!!!!!|`|AA12074640	Definitely college, although I was 39 before I finished my BA degree.|`|AA11044738	high school is very fun! in college you should be serious as you are now working for your future. kb

I have been working for about a year at a Wendy's in a service centre and I'm 14. Also, I don't have a high school working permit. I live in Canada though, so the laws might be different. <br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  A.<br>  <br>  [EDIT]: One of the other answerers is right. If you are younger than a certain age you aren't supposed to be working in the kitchen. <br>  <br>  Don't quote me, but I believe the Canadian laws are that you have to be 14 to work at a store. The front cashes at our restaurant are considered a store. <br>  <br>  But you need to be 15 or 16 to work in a factory, and the kitchen where the food is being made is considered a factory.<br>  <br>  (But maybe not all businesses will follow these laws ahaha)<br>  <br>  Also, if you wanna be really "rebelious" you could do what a few of my friends have done. Find out what the minimum age to work there is. If it's older than your current age, stretch the truth a bit and tell them you're old enough to work there ahaha..<br>  <br>  Like I said, I started working as soon as I turned 13. I called the service centre to see if they'd hire me with parental permission. They called the head office who told them that I could work, but just filling up cups and vending machines and things.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I'll quit boring you now! =D<br>  <br>  Once again, good luck,<br>  <br>  A.<br>  <br>  [Another EDIT! :-) ] I believe Southern Yankees is completely wrong. We hire people under 15. Also, please don't try to work odd jobs!!! I personally don't wanna hire people to do my house work or whatever. And people in my neighborhood seem to feel the same way.<br>  <br>  It seems like they just feel bad for you and try to think of something for you to do when you go door-to-door asking people to hire you.<br>  <br>  GO FOR A REAL JOB!!!<br>  <br>  Real job = more money and more fun!

uHhzqP3Haa	Teaching especially math, reading and special education. Look for a local education program in a college near you.

You could also start volunteering at a nursing home to make sure that is what you want to do. Once I did the course i realized nursing is NOT for me.|`|6d1c56bb07d8433546ab2691bb56e09baa	Call around to different nursing homes to see if and when they offer CNA courses.  Usually when the nursing home offers the class, then you will more than likely, be employed by them.  You must take the CNA course before working as a CNA so yes, you have to take the course then they, the nursing home, will train you in how they do things there so you can get to know the residents and such.  <br>  <br>  It also depends on where and who offers the CNA course how long it takes.  I live in Wisconsin and here its about 2 weeks or so long by going 8 hrs per day.  When I took mine, I went half days except when I had clinicals it was 8 hrs so mine was about 5 weeks long.  It probably depends from state to state and where you take it.  You can also check with your local Red Cross as well to see if they offer it too.  I know here in Wisconsin they offer the class thru the Red Cross. |`|h3IqnWpcaa	Cna training takes about 6 months to a year depending on where you live. To find somewhere to train you, contact you're local technical college. Most have Cna  courses. Keep in mind though, that after you complete the course, you still need to pass the state exam for your license.  And waiting for a test date may take a while. A lot of nursing homes will hire you with out your license, if you will receive it within 4 months. The amount of time may vary by state.

aPKW0ljVaa	i think a bachelors in early childhood educatuion would do it. 4 years. elementary needs also a masters degree in NY but not kindergarten i don't think. you could be a teachers assistant right now if you like. |`|WDumcza8aa	in my state k-5 takes a teaching certificate which is roughly equivalent to a bachelors degree, 4 years|`|UbXp2K26aa	You have to go to university for at least 4 years. Get a degree in education. And you have to specialize in something. You can see a school counsellor to help. |`|i7GdZTLbaa	You have several options.  I will give you my states' requirements and it will provide you some idea of what other states require.  They are all similar but not exactly alike.  Then I will give you what the 'better' path is - there is no 'best' path because we have to make career choices based on our lives and what works for one person may or may not work for someone else.  Rest assured that this is a "CAREER" choice. <br>  <br>  I live in Indiana and teach in a teacher education program so I know Indiana's requirements: <br>  <br>  1)  Pass 2 state mandated standardized tests:  the first is the PPST and the 2nd is the National Teachers Exam.  The first can be taken by computer but I'm not sure of the other.  <br>  <br>  2)  Since you are wanting to know specifically about teaching kindergarten then you have the following choices:<br>  <br>  Associates degree in Early Childhood which covers birth through grade 2 from a 2 year or 4 year institution.  This degree's graduates typically pays less than graduates from a 4 year institution.  They may or may not offer field experience (practice teaching under a teacher's watchful gaze.<br>  <br>  Bachelors of Arts or Science from a 4 year institution majoring in either early childhood or elementary education (el. ed. you would need to have a kindergarten endorsement along with your el. ed. coursework).<br>  <br>  3)  Student Teach:  this is the 'big' thing next to course work with field experience (working under a teacher for the duration of the methods (how and why to teach what) courses.  <br>  <br>  Each state has slightly different requirements in this are so check with your state.  <br>  <br>  The better path is always the degree that will get you more bang for the buck.  I recommend a 4 year accredited college or university that offers in school field experiences before student teaching.  If they do not offer this BEFORE student teaching look elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  The reason I say look elsewhere is that the children you teach deserve someone who knows both the theory and the practices and the content area knowledge that they are to teach.  The children should be everyone's first priority - everyone's responsibility including future teachers.  Too often they are not even included in the general picture of education.<br>  <br>  Don't choose to teach - any grade - because of the amount of education you need to do it.  Rather choose to teach because you can't imaging a more fulfilling career and that you can't see yourself doing anything else (that's how much love of children, learning, and teaching you must have). <br>  <br>  Good luck in choosing your career.   |`|029887909f8eb9ab8e7c4fdc02241d18aa	each state is different in terms of licensing. however, i believe the route would be to get your 4 year degree specializing in K - whatever...most the time it's K - 8. you will then have to take an test to be certified to teach. i believe there are only a couple of times you can take it, as well. so if you fail it more than once, i don't think you can get certified in that state. it's something you should research, and you can do so through your school counselor or contact a/the university in their education program. they can give you more info as to what you are looking for. programs change all the time, so it may be different now.<br>  |`|45a773de89c6b6a94a5780801566c620aa	Each state is different so this is basic: A 4 year liberal arts Degree, and an Education coarse to teach small people.

9kgCiU58aa	are you trying to figure out the new side lengths? well, if you use x as a variable for the width of the uniform strip cut off the sheet, then your new equation should be:<br>  <br>  (15-2x)(9-2x)=112<br>  <br>  from here, use the quadratic or whatever method you choose to solve. hope this helps.<br>  <br>  *the guy above is wrong =] the strip is 1/2 a cm|`|uhYKsDjRaa	First find the original area of 15 * 9 to make 135 cm^2.<br>  <br>  Let x = the area to be taken off. Since it is the same on both the length and width, we can use the same variable.(I'm glad for that!)<br>                                              length * width<br>  The new area will be equal to (15-x)  *  (9-x)  = 112<br>    Multiply these to get 135 - 24x + x^2 right?<br>  <br>    Rearrange to get x^2 -24x +135 = 112(the new area)<br>  <br>    Subtract(you probably know how to do the rest) 112 from both sides to get<br>               x^2 -24x + 23 = 0  and factoring you get (x-23)(x-1) = 0.<br>  <br>  x can't be 23 because that is more than the 15 and 9 we started with so x has to be 1.

The sheet taken is 14 x 8 which will leave a 1cm strip around the outside.<br>  <br>  I just played guess and repeat. The smaller sheet had to be a ratio to the first to leave a uniform strip so I took 1cm off each dimension to get 14 x 8 from 15 x 9 and thats how I got my answer.
xxb2wNRwaa	Yeah all those Ideas sound good. With big assignments and all I take breaks and all. Well since you are home and all its hard I cann see. I tend to procrasinate, but I pass bye. Try to make a schedule that you think will work for you. Take these ideas and make it benefit for yourself. I know how it is too my aunt bribes me in a way with money like for what6 grade I get and all. Also I have a twin brother so I usualy want to do better than him which he is lazier. Anyways try to maintain a schedule that you can follow don't do what I do and usually go take a nap after school or the computer like right now. AS tv is usually a problem for me at night, but I would try to do most of your work in the daytime from either morning  to afternoon, to evening. Best of luck to you on your scedule and everything :)|`|t3A9qpQIaa	The name of the game is called SELF DISCIPLINE!  Everyone struggles with it and some never learn it.  I agree, do your classes in the early AM.  Take a brisk walk to the library and study there.  Walking gets a lot of oxygen to the brain so you're "up" for it.  Some libraries have sound proof booths.  Do what you seem to put off first and make yourself do it at the time you assigned it.  Make a sheet with your daily schedule with times assigned for each thing.  Do the worst first.  Give rewards when you're done with something like a soda or something that would give your mind a break.  Give appropriate breaks like every 1 to 1 1/2 hrs.  You've taken the biggest step by realizing you need to do this.  Good for you!|`|YvuCN6qWaa	Since you go to the library why don't you just study and do your homework there? Get through your classes online and after that just head off to the library - take a break though, too much work isn't healthy. You could also keep a sticky note near the computer with all the things your mom is bribing you with and that would remind you to work hard to get good grades and your mom would get that certain thing for you :)
e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	there is a link between social work and nursing, both careers is offering help to people but their goals are different from this point of view you can explain that your interests is to go for a job offers help and assistances to people as you find happiness to do so. Good luck.|`|Gi7gVrHaaa	if you have some space left in your personal statement section maybe you can write something like i also find that nursing feeds into my interests as it has elements working as a social worker in it i.e. caring for people<br>  <br>  and then they'll know what you mean and also the other uni's will know that you have thought about your choices thoroughly<br>  but if you want to do nursing shouldn't you just start from scratch and apply only for nursing and have more choices and a better personal statement?

If you say yes they'll send you paperwork about housing, if you say no they'll still send you paperwork about housing.|`|3Zpe0Kz5aa	universities.atwebpages.com - try this site. It has info about different US scholarships for college students and their grades requirements.|`|QFv4TGzZaa	It can affect your overall Cost of Attendance.  For instance, someone that is living at home with their parents would have a lower Cost of Attendance than someone that is living on campus.  It costs more to live on campus than at home with Mom and Dad so their Cost of Attendence would be higher to accomodate the higher expenses.  How much of a difference just depends on the school.
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	an A is an A is an A.  Honors programs are not weighted any heavier than AP classes when colleges are selecting students.  <br>  <br>  They look at your overall GPA, what extra curriculars you were in, your SATs or other college tests you take (many colleges now have other tests that they prefer to the SATs), what classes you took at the HS level that may be important to your area of study with a focus on your Senior year, and any recommendations that you have from your teachers and people who are familiar with your work.<br>  <br>  I don't know about your school but in the schools I've attended and have taught in your grades will advance you up to the AP classes but you need a recommendation from your instructor to take the Honors classes--it's not just grades alone so you can't really just decide you want to take the class.<br>  <br>  If you've been given the option of taking an AP class over a regular paced class then unless the AP class interferes with something else you need to graduate or that would better help you in college, you should take the AP class.  If you are opting out of the AP class then I'd have to agree that you are not living up to your full potential.<br>  <br>  Talk to your teachers and your guidence counselor about what it is you want to accomplish.  They are in the best position to tell you if you are slacking off or if you are right on schedule.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mnx6LV07aa	Hey don't sweat it you're in normal classes! A lot of students are just because you're in advanced classes doesn't mean much everyone has the same potential its just how you organize yourself that matters. Honors courses are the best you can take in High School taking all regular classes is like driving 5 miles an hour on the express way. Its safe and all, but why are you wasting your time! <br>  <br>  I had Algebra 2 and Chemistry during my Freshman year they were quite easy! If you pay attention and ask questions where needed and take some notes you'll do fine. Don't feel bad you should just try harder next year take all honors courses! Then the year after that do some AP and honors and if you like it go for all AP senior year! Just remember to manage your time correctly and set aside what is important what isn't! That is pretty much the only difference in school situations. Managing time and paying attention in classes.

Getting to dress up and show who you are is just a coincidental plus.|`|CNgVwJgEaa	Yes they should.<br>  <br>  There's no hassle in choosing, it often makes the kids feel "grown up", it acts as a preventative against discrimination and the bullying that it could cause, it looks smart, the school is not taken seriously if they don't wear it.<br>  <br>  The only reason I could think of not is because they don't personally like it - but who does love their normal work attire in the real world?|`|1jIaovCEaa	no all students should have right to wear what they want to. only thing that should be prohibited is that there should be no tight *** cloths|`|ziZQWxi3aa	also, pros would be parents would save ALOT of money on school clothes.

Ideas like fallowing fields, rotating crops, adequate irrigation were developed in large part from necessity arising from the depression.|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	Farmers suffered a huge blow. They were producing so much yet nobody could afford to buy any of the products. Consequently, many of their crops went to waste while many people in America were starving. The government finally came up with a solution to pay them to NOT grow the amount of crops that they would have usually.<br>  <br>  The American Family was impacted by the great depression because prior to it, people were used to having so much. New technologies were coming about (cars, radios, washing machines) and many people were buying things without having the money to pay for it (also known as credit). When the depression hit, they still had their debt problems yet nobody had the income to pay it back.<br>  <br>  Women were impacted similarly to the general American Family. They were used to the high life of the American cultural boom prior to the depression. After it, they lost their jobs (mainly clerical work). There's much more detail but you'll need to do a little research. This is just scratching the surface.|`|q72aXjKiaa	weight loss and deep gratitude for food.

Aplique mis 3 a?os de secundaria y 2 semestres de mi prepa para becas y nada. Me hice residente permanente en el 2003 y para el 2004 mis padres decidieron mandarme a EUA. Tengo 4 a?os estudiando aka y no se compara. No he pagado ni un centavo en mi educacion. Me gradue de High School y me dieron 2 a?os completos pagados de colegio. Si tienes papeles o visa o lo que sea y no has hecho tu prepa alla en Mexico hazla aka. Es obligatoria por lo que no tienes pork preocuparte. Claro solo por entregar tu permiso a tiempo. Si ya la hiciste pues va a estar mas dificil. Casi siempre terminas pagando una fortuna por ser estudiante foraneo.

(meaning excess or exaggeration) and is a figure of speech in which statements are exaggerated. It may be used to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression, but is rarely meant to be taken literally.<br>  <br>  Hyperbole is used to create emphasis. It is a literary device often used in poetry, and is frequently encountered in casual speech. It is also a visual technique in which a deliberate exaggeration of a particular part of an image is employed. An example is the exaggeration of a person's facial feature in a political cartoon.|`|f57L7TKRaa	–noun Rhetoric. 1. obvious and intentional exaggeration. <br>  2. an extravagant statement or figure of speech not intended to be taken literally, as “to wait an eternity.”|`|SXE3WHIIaa	Hyperbole means exaggeration.
