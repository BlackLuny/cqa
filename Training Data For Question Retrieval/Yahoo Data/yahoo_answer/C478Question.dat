20090131163848AA6qXIf	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Have I properly grounded my outlet?	A while ago I replaced an old 2-Prong outlet with a GFCI outlet. I understand this is not the same as grounding the outlet.    Recently I added a length of bare copper wire (14GA) from the ground connection on the GFCI to the metal outlet box. I read that this would ground the outlet if it was wired with BX or some other metal shielded cable. However, I think the cable going into this outlet box is shielded in some kind of fabric weave (not metal, not plastic).  I don't think it has a 3rd wire either.     Then I tested the outlet with my 3-prong tester and it lights up "correct". My question to any expert electrician's out there: Is this outlet properly grounded?

I recently had a small demo at home by a lady who represents AMC at my place which was nice & convincing about the technical points what they speak about.   I agree with the points that   1. Overcooking spoils the taste & originality of the food.    2. Heating the utensil all over (happens in conventional cooking utensils) will overcook the surface of the food more which evaporates the vitamins & minerals (except salt) etc., This point is more important while frying with oil since the over fried oil (Oxidation) will be harm-full for the health.   3. I am not convinced about Pressure Cooker since the pressure coming out with whistle will definitely carries out the Vapors of the dissolved contents from the food.   4. Surely pore less utensil (high quality steel) ensures the freshness and originality of the food.       I am not sure about saving on the Gas. May be it depends on the procedure.      Will all the above points served by cooking with AMC Cookware ?

However, I don't shop around enough to really know if IKEA is the best choice for certain products.      It seems like they're pretty inexpensive for decent-good quality products, but is that really true? I've read that they're so cheap because the products are poor quality and you end up having to replace them very soon. I've also heard that they live up to their reputation for good products at a more affordable price. Even then, I also hear that they're actually not as good a value as they make themselves out to be (either because of what I first read or that they're not really the cheapest).      I'm in need of more shelving and bookcases. But since the single IKEA in my state is about 30-40 minutes away, if I were to go down there, I'd probably want to make the most of my time there. So I'm wondering if anyone can share their shopping experience and possible expertise with me. =)      Thanks!
20090131191059AAS9pXE	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Maytag Dryer HELP!  Lint build Up?	My wife and I tried to do laundry fo the first time in our new house.        We put the wet laundry in the dryer - it got warm (hot) but remained wet - as if it was just out of the washing machine.      The lint screen was spotless.  I looked down the slide (where the screen sits) and it was FILTHY!  There was an incredible amount of lint.  I vacuumed it out and got most of it and the dryer was getting hot, but did not seem to be work yet.  I decided to take off the clamp on a hose that run upwards behind the dryer.  It was a mess too.  \      The lint is moist also, which did not seem right. I cannot see how deep it up the PCV pipe - I thought about trying to snake it out.      Anybody have any idea of what could be going on... The lint being moist and why it is so built up?      Please help.

I am reupholstering a living room chair and even though I took pictures and numbered the pieces as i took it apart, I can't for the life of me remember everything exactly. It's driving me nuts. It has an upper cushion that is zippered inside, so I need to make a box so to speak. Try to envision the letter "B" as the cushion where you're looking at it from the side. A cushion on top and a cushion on the bottom where it's sewn across the middle, right to left. There are flaps on the top, sides, and bottom which are stapled to the chair, forming the cushion back. Whew! Thank you.
