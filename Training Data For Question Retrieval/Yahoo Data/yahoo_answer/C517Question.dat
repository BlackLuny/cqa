I am not quite sure as too what is goin on with me, all I know is I am starting to panic real bad and I am holding it in so my kids wont see. I have been for about 4-5 years had a slight sensation, more of a just very faint pressure about 1-2 in down under right breast and it kinda flows around to side, well past couple of months it seems to be more burning sensation, and occasionally like i have a pin pokin me in side. Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again. Thanks so much         oh and the ekgs were normal         I do use arms alot, Im only 32.

It all started when my 38yrs old unmarried sister in-law moved to live next door . the main reason was to leave her parents before they die .. as she thinks she should  leave them before they leave her . just to give u an idea, her parents are slaves to her .they do what ever she wants ,since she used to have a medical nervous condition !   at the beginning ,i thought i could fix things , like i can be a sister and listen to her ..and an abnormal relationship started ! a relationship based on her nagging to me while i give her solutions . (  i bet that is what she did to her mom! i see her turning us into slaves ,giving my husband tasks to do around her house every now and then . she is around us everywhere we go (she doesn't have friends and never a single boyfriend)  and to tell you the truth ,i have never met a more negative depressing person in my life !    i held on to the relationship for my husband's sake and because i pitied her and thought i could help !   the problem started when i gave birth to my daughter which made her around us all the time ..she says she feels like her mom since she felt her kicks in my tummy and since she knew her before she was born ..she feels , my daughter is going to be just like her and nag just like her ,and take the same antidepressants just like her,    she wants to feed her and mother her everyday !    once we went for a month's vacation ..she told me she can't live without seeing her !   so there she is every night after work , cuddling ,feeding and bonding with my new baby !    finally , i couldn't bear this anymore ! i tried gentle ways to tell her which ended in failure ..so i cracked up  by telling her that  she is very possessive ..and that she wants everything done for her ..and that she is obsessed with being the mother of my baby ! and that she wants my baby to be an extension of her !!   now ..we don't talk ! please tell me if i did the right thing ? i really don't need someone to put negative ideas in my child's head since day 1! would you have felt the same way ? or was i jealous of her bonding with my baby ?? i am really confused and feel guilty !   thank you

I find that if I get upset, I tend to go off and then I cant stop thinking about it, like it lingers over me. Then I find that out of no where it'll pop up in my mind for no reason, taking me back to the bad feelings I felt when it happened. Wether it be embarasment, anger or guilt. Like something that was embarassing that happened a long time ago, even years, can just pop in my head out of no where. Then I'll remember the bad feelings that I did when it happened and more or less just relive it.      I have heard that meditation wether it be from just a sitting form, Tai Chi, Yoga and even walking/jogging can help. Just meditation in general.

20090220075420AAEA7nx	Health;Dental	Why do i have intermittent pain in my right jaw/temple?	i had my upper left wisdom tooth removed just over 2 months ago, at the same time i had a filling to the 1st molar lower right. The wisdom extraction was fine, but when the dentist came to do the filling, the right side wasn't numb enough, so she gave me another injection, 10 mins later she came back but it still wasnt very numb, so she gave me another injection (this injection felt like it went deeper than the previous 2 and it really hurt which i thought was strange seeing as id had a load of anaesthetic there already (could it have perhaps hit bone/ a nerve??)).   the dentist did the filling (which she said was "very big") and i went home. After the numbness wore off my (right)jaw ached for about 10 days, which i put down to bruising after the injections. (the extracted wisdom tooth was fine didnt have any noticable pain what so ever).      so a couple of months later and i have now got an intermittent pain in my right side jaw and temple.   It doesnt hurt when i touch it, nor is it affected by chewing, talking yawning etc. the pain just comes and goes, but when it comes it really hurts.   none of my teeth are hurting, but the filled tooth has been quite sensitive since the filling (ie. it doesnt like cold water). and it is the only sensitive tooth that i have.   i had an infection in my lower right wisdom tooth over a year ago, and this pain feels totally different to that which i felt then.      has anybody experienced anything similar?? or have any ideas as to what may be wrong??      thanks in advance for any help.   xx

I know that I am quite out of shape, so I'm not too concerned about the tiredness/soreness; I'm more concerned about why my thighs are so sore by my abs barely feel anything.

I have been for about 4-5 years had a slight sensation, more of a just very faint pressure about 1-2 in down under right breast and it kinda flows around to side, well past couple of months it seems to be more burning sensation, and occasionally like i have a pin pokin me in side. Now also my right shoulder blade seems to have a constant tingly sensation kinda like when your leg falls asleep, and that is running up into top of shoulder and into arm and also down side of my back. SOMETIMES not always but when i take a deep breath under right shoulder blade kinda hurts. I have gone and had gallbladder ultrasound done and they said it was normal. I had an H-pylori test where they check for cancer causing bacteria and it was normal, and they also checked my liver, kidneys, sodium , red blood cells and white and all of this was normal. Oh and everytime i take deep breath or stretch my back seems to be always popping. I guess I am hoping for a little piece of mind before i go to dr again.

20090220081029AAeqYFu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What could this be? I'm scared.?	I'm 16 years old.   In the end of December/early January, I was sick. I had bronchitis, tonsilitis, and gastritis. I was having these episodes every night for about a week, I went to four different hospitals. All they would say is that it's a panic attack. And one said it's acid reflux.   Okay, so it went away after that. Now, on Valentines day, I was with my boyfriend in the city about to go out to eat at Chevy's, and I had another episode. I felt like I was taking a hot shower and the water just turned ice cold, and that feeling of being able to breathe but in a gasping way, just came to me. It didn't stop. I was feeling weak, I was stumbling and I felt like I was gonna faint. My heart was beating so fast, and I felt like I was in another world. Everything felt so unreal, my boyfriend was so scared and he called my mom. These episodes last for about 2 hours and always happen around midnight.   It happened again last night.   I went to the hospital.   They said it sounds like an anxiety disorder, and they said I should see a therapist. I know for a fact that it's not this, I don't know what it is, but I know it's not this. I barely have any stress, I'm a super happy person, I have no anxiety, and I especially wasn't upset when I was about to go to a Mexican resturant (my favorite food) on Valentine's day! And honestly, I know I shouldn't be saying this, but I know theres something wrong, and each time these episodes happen, they get worse, and I'm not gonna wait until it's too late.   I got my blood and urine checked, nothings wrong. I got a chest exam, nothing. I'm schedualed for an MRI on saturday, and something called an EEG? on tuesday, and than if anything I need to get hooked up on a monitor to my brain for 48 hours.   I know you probably will say "wait it out" but I'm going to the doctors in 20 minutes, and he wanted me to look it up so we could think about all the possible tests out there, because he thinks I'm a smart girl and he knows this isn't all in my head. Unlike all the other doctors, he doesn't treat me like I'm an immature baby. I know what I'm feeling.   10 points. =/

Sore throat chills and a feeling of an all-over sunburn, a horrible cough and the normal stuffy nose. Then about two days ago it all stopped but for the sore throat. Then yesterday after i returned from school i sat down and my left ear began to bother me. My throat seemed to be on fire and it was all i could do to not cry. Then almost immediately the pain in my throat disappeared and my inner ear felt like it was about to explode.  my father soon went to the store to find a bottle of sweet oil to sooth the pain as this is something my mother used to do when i was a small child. after my dad came back and i put the medicine in my ear the pain began to taper away. When i woke up this morning the sore throat was back and the hearing in my left ear is messed up and im hearing slower than what my right ear is. Everything sounds higher and slower like a messed up cassette tape.       i personally have no clue what to do and the pain comes and goes.       please tell me what you think is happening as I am very worried.

I have personally switched myself onto a healthier way of eating but have recently discovered many of the things I eat such as wheat bread contain it and I'm wondering if eaten in moderation in a low calorie lifestyle if it is still just as bad for you?      I'm a female, I'm 5'11" and weigh almost 200lbs my goal weigh is anywhere from 175-160 as I have a large frame. I have switched from white rice to brown rice, white pasta to whole wheat pasta, and eat tons of fruits + veggies. I have also switched from regular milk to soy milk, regular eggs to organic eggs, and frozen organic fruits. I don't eat red meat or pork, and I don't drink anything but water + diet green tea with citrus. I exercise an hour to 2 hours per day, normally I exercise around 90 minutes.      With all that said should I give up my wheat bread because it contains high fructose corn syrup? Is there a bread out there that doesn't contain it or would you have to make your own?      Thank you so much.

Some foods I can tolerate, some foods I completely avoid because of how sick and weird it makes me feel after I eat it.  My doctor said I'm still not diabetic, but I am hypoglycemia-low blood sugar, which means I have to eat every 2 hours, to avoid passing out.  I had a cup of coffee, with cream, and a dab of real sugar, because I heard the pink stuff (sweet n low) was a killer.  Then I had a baked boneless, skinless chicken breast, lightly seasoned with mango salsa, and white rice, one serving of white rice.  Now about an hour later, I feel like I"m holding on trying to do what I can to avoid passing out, I don't know if it is because I haven't eaten enough today, to keep me going, or the white rice, which I don't eat daily nor a lot of, is doing the damage.  Please Help?  By the way, I'm at work, and I have a butthole for a boss, no paid sick leave. What can I do to try to maintain for the rest of the day?

This friend of mine has stop after telling her that we loved her no matter what. SHe passed her grades, she just worried if she fails and what her parents might think but she passed and got her credits for it. What is worrying me, is why she cut herself when she could have just spoken up. Now we are talking to her a lot about how she can overcome that behavior and find other ways of solving her issue without going there and that we all love her and her parents join in to help so now she is happier.

20090220085241AAoH2Av	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do abdominal oblique exercises improve waist definition?	I have a narrow waist anyway, so it doesn't matter to me, but a book i was flicking through earlier today claimed that oblique exercises give you a more defined waist.       I thought waist definition depended on your body fat, which isn't effected by muscle tone?      So, is it true of false that oblique stretches improve muscle tone? Thanks. =D

20090220085030AAhDf5X	Health;Women's Health	Question about pregnancy, BC Pill and PLan B?	Okay here are the details..   Since having my son in November 2007 I went on the pill.  I stopped for one month (January 2009).  I got my period on the 3rd or 4th of February, went back on the pill on February 8.     My husband and I had unprotected sex at 12 midnight February 16 (had been on pill for 8 days).  Took plan B at 5:30 that night, and 5:30 Tuesday morning.    It is now Friday and the only side effects I've had are headaches, crankiness and tiredness.  Plus, I have a white to yellow stringy discharge.   I know I can take a pregnancy test, but I would like some thoughts before (it is too early for a HPT.)  I would appreciate any suggestions, if Plan B worked, was I on the pill long enough, etc..   Thank you!

My period came as usual on the 1st January and it stays for around 1 week it was perfectly normal. I am also taking the anti-depressant cipralex and ran out of these tablets which resulted in not taking them for 4 days. Then a day later i found it hard to sleep and had a weird feeling i was going to take my period and this was on the 17th of febuary just over a week after i had finished my last period, when i got up in the morning i found i was bleeding but very lightly then the next day i was still bleeding i did not feel like this was a period as it is light and looks like sticky blood which quite a strange odor. I thought maybe i had taken my period again in result of not taking my tablets for a number of day but wasn't sure if it was my period or not. i am also sexually active.   If you can help thanks

Yesterday I picked it up from the pharmacy and  have been having second thoughts about using it. I paid $30 for it mind you. I read on the nuvaring website that if you are using t postpartum (after having a baby) or post abortion, the increased risk of thromboembolism (a blood clot) must be considered. This scares me because I had a daughter 9 months ago. I am confused on how this product is susposed to be used since I have never used it before. Do you think if it was a great concern she would have said something? Should I consider switching back to the pill for ease of my mind? I don't want to waste money but if I am not comfortable with this bc method I should switch right?

20090220083802AA2GxQ8	Health;Dental	Normal amount of pain following a tooth extraction?	I am a 27 year old female. I had tooth number 15 (way in the back on top) extracted on Monday. Several dissolvable stitches were used. The extraction was successful and my surgeon put me on penicillin to avoid infection. Today is Friday and I am experiencing a new irritation. It's just mildly painful and controllable with Advil. The source of the annoyance seems to be the knot holding the stitches together. I have been rinsing several times a day with salt water. I am wondering if this is normal or if I have developed a dry socket.      Thanks to all!

20090220094021AA4IT89	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Lung Cancer or other major illness?	I am an 18 year old male who has smoked about 3 packs of cigarettes a week. I work, go to school,and I also have been helping my aunt repaint her house recently. I was extremely sore after repainting the entire basement by myself. I also mop an entire store at work 3 times a week. My chest, my arms, and my shoulders were extremely sore. This was 2 weeks ago. I still feel dull pain in my arms and shoulders, not to mention a sharp pain in my sternum area in my chest. One second, it would be on the left side, then it will occur on the right side. I sleep on a couch that is not straight and has many irregular lumps and dents in it. I often get back pains too. I do not cough, wheeze, or have any excess mucus or phlegm. Ive visited the doctor today, and had a chest x-ray. I am waiting on the doctor to call me back with the results. Do you think that I might have lung cancer? I am not a heavy smoker at all, and i only smoke black and milds which might be equivalent to 2-3 packs of cigarettes a week. My biceps, and shoulders still sore. Do you think that I am still sore from using my muscles more than i regularly would? Or do you think that the chest pain and the soreness could be tied to lung cancer? Please give me some advice. I am worried.

I have had a loss in my life and no one seems to understand its magnitude except maybe my current therapist.  Lately, I have been having urges to contact that person I lost even though it may be dangerous for my future.

Right now, I feel like I am stuck in a place where if I play it safe, I am not living but rather building my pain, but if I do what I have the urge to do, I might feel better but endanger my future.

My only problem is that the pain is almost unbearable at times. I can't apply a warm, moist compress without removing clothing so I've been using a heating pad and soaking in the tub daily. I was wondering if there was anything I can do with products at home that can relieve my pain a little. Keep in mind of the area that it's in.      PS, I can be very paranoid and tend to make "mountains out of molehills", so I'd appreciate it if you could leave HELPFUL, RATIONAL, comments. And like I said, I will go see a doctor. Thank you!

20090220090351AAzB94p	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Mono or worse??? Those with medical background or similar experience...please help me figure out what this is.?	This all started at the end of January. MY 16 y/o daughter was getting so fatigued that she was sleeping 16-18 hours a day. She ran slight fever and had chills for 3-4 days. She had body aches, joint pain and a mild headache. It's been almost three weeks now and she is still sick. She gets better for a day or two and then relapses. When I first took her to the doctor, they did a CBC which looked fine. (No mono test). They did a urinalysis which showed a LOT of RBC, few WBC. Put her on Bactrum. When the culture came back, it showed resistance to that so they switched her to Macrobid. She is almost finished with that. I took her back today and she still has a ton of RBC's in her urine, terrible sore throat, one large patch with yellow exudate, swollen glands and tender splenic area. They did an ultrasound, her spleen size was at 10, which they said was normal. I need to know what we are looking for. They have repeated the blood work and are adding more to it this time, checking metabolites, etc. I can't stand seeing my normally energetic, happy girl so sick. Oh, two days ago, a Monospot test came back (-). I know they are not super- accurate. Does mono present with symptoms in that order? I thought it started with sore throat and splenic discomfort..and for sure that it would be better after this long.    Any help is really appreciated. I am a nursing student which probably doesn't help. I feel helpless and doubly stressed....

20090220091241AAXTBqL	Health;Other - Health	Who should I contact about possible health risk violation?	My son is a college student studying product design and working with a product that requires a dust collection system.  There is no collection system in the room he is working in and the dust is everywhere.  Respirator's are required but only for those in the room and only while working with the product.  It is not toxic but the MSDS  does state respirator requirements.  If he went to the college about the risk, it could put him in a "student against teacher" situation but because this stuff is now everywhere, will continue to be everywhere all semester long, and those in nearby rooms may also be at risk, it is a tricky situation.  As it is none toxic it isn't an EPA issue.  As it is not "work" related it isn't an OSHA issue.  Who should we talk to about the health risk?

20090220091812AAmlTMY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I have bulimia and I need to stop. But I cant. Help?	I've been bulimic since about a month before my sixteenth birthday, about seven months ago. I was 5'4", 211 lbs, and hated my body. I started throwing up, and it just all came off so quickly. I hated the moments from right after I finished eating, all the way up to right afterr I puked, and I loved every other moments. Now, I'm 5'5", weighing 152 lbs. I'm still not satisfied with my body.      About two months ago, my family found out. My mom didn't want to take me to a doctor because she didn't want the stigma, so she just watched me for three hours after I ate for a few days. Once she let it go, I started again. I just hate food, hate the way it feels inside of my stomach, hate the way I look when I'm full. I don't just throw up after binging; I throw up everything I eat, with the exception of on the weekdays, breakfast and lunch because I have a job and I can't puke here. But I don't allow myself more than 800 calories EVER and 99% of the time, I stay below 700 calories. I throw up about an hour after I eat. Sometimes two hours after, if my mom is with me and I have to wait.      Two weeks aho, I got vertigo and severe nausea so I was taken to the doctor to get blood work done. (No one knows I'm still bulimic except for my friends.) My labs came back fine, really healthy.      Basically, my question is that I don't want to keep throwing up because I don't want to get sick, but it's mental now. I just freak out at the thought of calories being digested. I want to just exercise, but my mom doesn't let me and I can't go out by myself and my mom doesn't let me have friends and she doesn't want to pay for a gym. It's all really complicated and she gets mad when I want to eat healthy as opposed to fast food and junk. She's very obese and loves to eat junk and comfort foods.      Please, someone, just tell me how I can train my brain to love food again, or at least to get my mom off my case about eating right.

He prescribed bacterim to me ( a sulfur drug i think?) and i have Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, an auto immune disease. I took methotrexate and i was not allowed to take sulfur with it because of a possible reaction?  I have not had any flare ups in a while, and my doctor took me off of methotrexate. anyways, when i took the steirod ( a 10 day process) i didn't have a reaction til about the seventh day which was probably monday of this week, i noticed spots my mom took me to the doctor and they told me i  had hives prescribed me medicine i took it went to school the next day still had a little  on my body. had a huge amount of hives on my body the next day so my mom made me stay home. I went to school yesterday, still had a great amount of hives but it didn't bother me. THIS morning i woke up sore throat stiff neck nothing out of the ordinary i looked in the mirror and i am ALMOST completely covered in hives like on my legs and arms i have some on my neck and in my hair line and probably 2 on my face. and alot on my stomach.  they itch too we went to the doctors and they said it was not chicken pox and it wasn't strep either.I stopped taking the medicine on monday but it has gotten progresivly worse throughout the week. does anyone have any idea about what might possibly be wrong with me?? thankyou so much if you can help me! :)

20090220093337AAvwboV	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why am I suddendly so hungry?	Ok. A couple of weeks ago, I decided that I was gonna start eating healthier. I started drinking only water and eating 5 or 6 small healthy meals every day. Before I started this "diet" I would eat way less but a lot unhealthier. And I had to kinda retrain my body to eat more often instead of going for hours without eating. However, now I constantly feel hungry, even though I'm eating the same amount as I was before. Has anyone else had a problem like this? I was thinking it could be that my metabolism is speeding up but i honestly have no idea what it could be

My husband and I, and a few others are doing a walk for Autism,    My son Noah has been undergoing tests for years and it is thought that he has an ASD.. he doesnt get his actual diagnosis until June, when the last of his testing is completed.

20090220093549AAhMyzs	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Sharp Shooting pain in left side underneath ribcage?	For around 8 months now, i keep getting a sharp, shooting pain underneath my left side. This happens nearly every day, however sometimes it is more painful than others. Over time, it has increased to being underneath my whole ribcage, and stomach. When I get the pain, it can be painful for me when i breathe and stand up. It is also usually sore after I have eaten. This has lead me to eating less over these 8 months, and not as healthily as perhaps i should be.      I have been to the doctors 4 times about this pain. I was given stomach acidity tablets, however these were not effective. The other doctors are not sure as to what is wrong with me, and I have started loosing hope.       Has anyone had this or know what can be done to help?      Thanks.

My mother has several debilitating illnesses that she has been taking potent meds for, for quite some time, prescribed by her long time MD.       When January rolled around, she had to take her yearly urinalysis, which is required when u are under a pain contract. Well, she failed the urinalysis, and even though she passed the blood test, her MD divorced her, leaving her to detox and suffer...      I know my mother did nothing wrong, I care for her, and know she takes her meds and also know there are several causes for a false negative urinalysis, all of which applied to my mother (which explains why she failed)      Her doctor has offered to transfer all medical records to a new MD without mentioning why she is no longer her patient, but we have a dilemma:   When the new MD asks my mother why she is no ,longer under her care, how could she answer without affecting his opinion of her, clouding his judgement, which would greatly affect his approach to her treatment?

20090220093950AAOpqEh	Health;Mental Health	Depression/Anxiety/Crazy?	I would consider myself a generally happy person with a pretty stable life. I have a group of close friends who I see often and love, a boyfriend who is pretty much my best friend, and I am really close with both sides of my family. I go to school, I work part-time and I play lacrosse.  Although it isn't an extravagant life by any means, I'm very fortunate to live the life that I live. Nothing to cry about, right?      Well lately, I have been have been breaking down, more than I can ever remember doing in the past. I get an idea in my head, or maybe nothing in particular at all, and I get overwhelmed thinking about it and I just cry. Usually it happens when I'm by myself, up in my room and I cry for the rest of the night, and when I wake up the next day I feel better.       But last night, it happened really unexpectedly while I was getting ready to go out with friends. We were all hanging out, getting ready to go to a club: And the weirdest thing was that I was excited! I had been looking forward to it all week long and was actually in a fairly good mood. But out of nowhere I started to feel really overwhelmed and ran into the bathroom and started crying. It only lasted for a few minutes, but for the rest of the night, I just felt so blah, like not happy or sad, just neutral.      I don't think I am depressed because it isn't constant. I feel happy most of the time, but then I'll have a meltdown, out of nowhere.      I am kind of a worrier, so I wonder if maybe it's anxiety? But then, I don't have the physical symptoms of a panic attack. I just get really sad, really suddenly and uncontrollably.       It's starting to happen so frequently, I feel like it's self-perpetuating. Like the more I think about it, the more it happens and the more it happens, the more I worry about it.       Any insight to what this might be?

My dad is in Greece taking care of our hotel business.  We live in a one family home that is really little. It has one bedroom, one kitchen, one bathroom, and one living room.  My room used to be a garage until we put a rug and a bed.  Now, for 20 years the room has been liked that.  The building department finally decided to do something about it and we have to make the room back to a garage.  My dad had a stroke before he went to Greece. The medical bills are so much..  My mom is sometimes home on the weekends and then she gets mad at me and calls me spoiled because i ask her If I can hang out with my friends.  This gets me aggrevated and i feel like screaming and punching something but I feel that will only make things worse.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

20090220095341AARb7li	Health;Men's Health	Is it normal for a 13 year old boy to be this clumsy?	My son ended up taking to hospital my friends 13 year old son this morning after he managed to injure himself. The boy is staying with us until Sunday night since he has a few days off of school and his mother is busy.      Now his mother assures me the boy is clumsy on a regular basis and that what happened does not surprise her, and also that her son has recently been to an optometrist and does not need glasses. However, I just don't think its normal for someone to be this clumsy.      The reason for the hospital visit was because he slipped outside and sprained his ankle, as well as hitting his arm on a stump and I guess he must have popped a blood vessel or something because it swelled up two about twice its normal size and you could tell there is some internal bleeding.      Now that alone wouldn't make me ask this question, it's winter and icy. What makes me ask this question is since he arrived, he has had quite a bit of unfortunate things happen to him.      He somehow hit the corner of a wall and cut the side of his face by his eye, this just needed a band-aid.   He also cut his finger at breakfast, again, it just needed a band-aid.      He apparently knelt on a razor that had fallen out of his bag when he was looking for his pyjamas, I only found out about that this morning though. He said he tended to it himself by tying on of hi t-shirts to his knee.      As well as that, he also stubbed his toe on a vacuum cleaner and tore the skin, and that bled for a few hours. what I want to know is, if you agree with me that this is not normal, what should be done, should he be taken to a head doctor, or a different optometrist or what?

How should i change my diet and what are some things easy for a 18 year old male to cook. im a bit lazy when it comes to cooking so please tell me some simple stuff to cook. should i take any drinks/ powders/ bars/ etc? and what kind?

20061119063648AAQmQHA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Does Kojic acid work well as a skin lightener and safe for a person with skin eczyma?	I have a fair complexion and my skin now looks a little tanned and has an uneven skin tone, especially on my arms. I recently bought Kojic acid soap and researched on it... I haven't heard any reviews or feedback from people who used it and I'm afraid I might get dry skin because I also have eczyma (a form of dermatitis).       Is Kojic acid safe and as natural as numerous sources say it is? If not can anyone  reccomend a good skin lightener?      I also apply ointment (Eucerin, but so far been using petroleum jelly) on my skin because of my dermatitis, is it also alright to place that when I use the Kojic acid soap? If it's important to know, I've been using Dove unscented soap... but I just had to whiten my skin so I bought Kojic acid.      If anyone has good advice... THANK YOU!

I'm really run down."  Then I said that Mom was going to get a nice lunch and he asked "what?" and I said that she said it was going to be a surprise.  And he said "I don't know about your mother and her surprises".  His tone and attitude or just so negative.  It pushes me away.  The last couple of weeks, I have been suffering a bit from stress/anxiety, so this negativity isn't helping at all!      He did not instill confidence in me and I did not instill it in myself, so I'm trying really hard now as an adult to gain it.  It's hard!! My dad's personality and mine are different.  He's more on the serious side and is almost like a boss than a Dad sometimes.  Truly he loves me because he doesn't show it affectionately or with words, but in actions.      How can I enjoy being around my Dad again?

20070319124612AAZtN5R	Health;Women's Health	Ayer estuve a punto de tener mi primera vez y estaba tan nerviosa que no pude. Les ha pasado? Consejos x favor	No sé qué hacer... para mí iba a ser mi primera vez, y además con la persona que amo. Estaban todas las condiciones para que sucediera, pero estaba tan tensa que ni siquiera me excité como en otras ocasiones en las que sólo nos hemos acariciado. Mi novio estaba muy excitado y hasta en un momento me pareció que apuró un poquitito las cosas (quizás fue impresión mía debido a los nervios). Tenía todo el cuerpo muy tenso y por eso me dolía el mínimo intento. No sé que hacer! Me siento muy mal. Tengo miedo de que mi novio ya no me desee tanto ( a pesar de q se portó muy lindo, y me dijo que intentaremos las veces q sean necesarias) o de que el miedo y los nervios siempre me superen y nunca pueda concretar nada. Les ha pasado? Denme consejos por favor. De verdad los necesito. Cómo hago para relajarme un poco en esa situación?

I have had a child and I am not sure of this procedure or not. If I choose to do this it will be when I am done having children and breastfeeding.   Can i get a B cup implant?

20070408132343AAMMRWd	Health;Men's Health	Problem with my penis?	my penis is about 8 1/2 inches long while errect, but when i get errect the skin on my penis is extremely tight.  It is so tight that the base of my penis gets alot of pressure, and underneath my testicles where my penis connects into my body becomes very hard and stiff.  i started to notice this problem like a year ago, but it has gotten alot worse over time.  It is extremely uncomfortable and annoying when i have an errection.      im thinkin that i was circumcised too tight, and there isnt enough skin on my penis to compensate the amount of blood that can fill it up.      does anybody know what i should do?
