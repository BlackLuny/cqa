20070111154754AAyt7oX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What shall i do?	I am a mom of two little boys ( 2 years and a month ) I feel that keeping the house spotless is a priority. I have to do the cleaning EVERY single day. I've been doing this for years. I am just so tired of it. I can't start my day if the house is not sparkling. Once the house is clean I become a calm person and I can start my day then. However, I just got so tired of doing this every single day. I feel I am compromising time with my children for cleaning. I don't know if you understand what I am tslking about. It is just so frustrating. How can I get over the cleaning thing ??? serious answers only please...

20070214054828AAtF7tW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Took HPT yesterday and today....?	It was ept.  My period isn't due until Friday.  Yesterday when I took the test a line started to show up after 2 min, but very faint and then by 5 min it was a little darker and thicker blue.  Today same thing.  Can I be sure this isn't evaporation lines?  I have had bad experience with evap. lines in the past, but then again I looked at those tests well after the time frame.  This time it took 2 min for faint thin line to show, but got thicker and darker by 5 min.      Oh I took a First Response and I believe it to be neg. cause there isn't a second line I can see.  I looked online and it said that First Response can actually only detect 100 and EPT can detect 40 so should I not be dissappointed about the first response test being neg and believe the EPT test?  Confused!!!!
20070131171252AAslItK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Shouldn't it not matter how much sex you have when you're trying to conceive since men produce so much sperm	anyways?  I mean if they produce 4 million-250 million sperm and you have sex everyday, shouldn't there still be more than enough sperm in there to get pregnant?  Men are constantly producing sperm.  Even if they are having regular sex, so why would it lower a chance to get pregnant if he has a lot of sex?  I'm confused???

Since the miscarriage we had sex once with protection and withdrawal method about  5 days after the last day of my period. (march 31st)   I was supposed to get my period last week and didn't get it.    Last week I had night sweats 2 days in a row. Over the weekend I started having really bad headaches with nausea. I also feel dizzy and groggy. Even when I'm just standing I feel like i'm gonna fall over. Had diarreha over the weekend for no reason. Now I'm having increased discharge.    I'm not planning to have a baby anytime soon since I'm stil sad about the miscarriage. That is why we had sex only once with protection in 4 months. I'm just really confused about what's happening with my body. I want to think that I'm not pregnant but I just feel different and that's how I felt with my 1st pregnancy.

20090202090209AAy1mj5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anxiety and possible depression. 30 weeks pregnant.?	So, here is my problem.. I'm always very anxious. And worried. And I always feel "sad". Always. Its like it never goes away. I always feel like crying. Even when I'm out with friends and trying to take my mind off of everything. I just can't get properly happy about everything. I love that I have my 2 year old son, I love my husband and being with him, and I love that we're having baby boy #2.. And I'm happy about all of that.. But I don't think I'm actually happy like I should be. I'm not  saying that I don't want my life anymore or anything like that. I don't really know how to explain it.. I'm happy but at the same time I'm not. All I want to do is just sit.. and be alone.. and cry..      But I'm not sure if its me, like if its real. Or if its just because my husband is in Iraq, so I'm just constantly worried about him. He has been gone since September but I really don't remember feeling like this the whole time he has been gone.. And its been over 4 months already.      So, I really just can't figure out if I'm just super worried about my husband and worried about this deployment. And everything that this stupid deployment comes with. He wont be home for good until September of this year.    Or if maybe I am depressed. And I hate using that word and I hate thinking about it. Because aren't depressed people supposed to be sad and unhappy with everything in their lives? I'm not sad and unhappy with everything in my life.. I love my life, I really do.       I'm just... sad. I have a prenatal appointment on the 11, so I'll definitely be mentioning it then.. And I know I should have mentioned it at my last appointment. I just.. I don't remember ever feeling so sad before. It feels like everything has just hit me the last few weeks. I just don't know if its me.. Or if its more serious... does that make sense?      Any (nice) opinions would be great.. If you think its me.. or if you actually think, maybe, I really am 'depressed'..

20081008124257AAvqH14	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Unusual spotting 10 days before my period is due?	Today I noticed a slight bit of blood when I wiped.  Just real pinkish mixed with some discharge.  Not even enough for a panty liner.  My next period isn't due until the 17th or 18th.  Depending if I get it on day 28 or 29 of my cycle.  So about 9-10 days away my period is due.  Why would I have some spotting now?  If you would even want to call it spotting, it's so light!  I think I ovulated on the 3rd, 4th or 5th of this month.  So it can't be spotting from ovulation.  I just had a baby 3 months ago to.  I have had two normal periods since then.  Anyone know what may be going on?  Thanks!

20081016110314AAs2GPr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What should I do about my 21 month old who has had diarrhea for about a month now?	Stool tests came back normal at the pediatrician and she has no other symptoms.  She is down in weight from her 18 month appt (about 2 pounds).  But she is drinking plenty (several cups of water per day along with a cup of milk in the morning) and shows no signs of dehydration.  She is an EXTREMELY picky eater, with only a small repetoire of tolerated foods.  She does love milk, juice (which we have reduced to just a splash in her sippy cup 1-2 times a day since this has been going on), Cheerios, Dan-o-nino yogurt, chicken nuggets and crackers.  She is a happy, energetic kiddo with no other symptoms accompanying this chronic diarrhea.  We have been referred to a gastroenterologist but can't get in for several weeks.  Anyone have experience with this and know anything I can do to help?  I have been giving her Florator for several days in her drink twice a day but it hasn't made a difference.  I would appreciate any advice!
20081024111708AA6kVzB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need newborn care...no insurance...options?	I'm currently 33 weeks pregnant, my husband and I do not have insurance. (I was in the process of shopping around when I found out I was pregnant, then was considered pre-existing and no one would cover me...& we do not financially qualify for any state aid..medical, aim, etc.) I'm delivering at a birth center with a midwife where I am also going for all my prenatal care (paying cash). Anyways, I'm wondering what my best option is for getting newborn care for our daughter who is due Dec. 12. My husband is in the process of getting coverage at his work, but most likely will not kick in until after she is born...so until we can all be covered through him, what are our options?    - Pay cash for her newborn care visits until the insurance kicks in? If we do this, how do we go about finding a pediatrician? and how much would the visits cost?   - Get individual insurance for my husband and put her under his insurance then cancel that one when his work insurance kicks in?   - ???? HELP ????      ***we do not financially qualify for any state aid (medical, aim, etc.)   ***we are in southern California

My senior year we broke up but feeling were still there. Anyways about 3 years later i broke with my new gf. just so happen she broke up with hers and we saw each other and started seeing agin. yah you know we smashed. a year later she pops a kid and says it her ex's one. Did a little math and it sounds like it may be a possible mine. So we fought and then didnt speak for another 3 years. then outta the blue she calls and says she on my side of the island. We meet and talk and then stay hotel and you guessed it we smashed. its been about a year now and yups you guessed it she had a baby again. i havent seen it but ive been always been having nightmares from the first one and i try so hard to talk nicely to her and work something for a test so i can help if its mine. she says no and now she talks very stink about me and for what i havent spoken to her in a year. i did nothing wrong but to try make things right for the kids.

20090105072828AAPoZiP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could i be pregnant?  is it possible?	I feel very stupid for asking this, but...      My period is always irregular. It's been about 32 days since my last one. My boyfriend and I have never had sex before, but we came close to doing on the day (I learned) that I am most fertile. He got close to my opening, but we I freaked out and told him I changed my mind. He didn't ejaculate or anything.      Now I've been under a lot of stress this last week that I've been expecting my period. I had a drop of blood the day after Christmas, some brown junk in my underwear yesterday, and then last night when I went to the bathroom, I wiped and it was pink. I awoke this morning with a drop of blood (again), so I put a tampon in and the blood that was on it was very light and brown. Now there's nothing. I took a pregnancy test, but it came back negative, although I took it last night, not in the morning.      Am I pregnant or is the stress that I've recently experienced plus the huge stress I have on myself right now to blame for my light period/possible spotting?      Just to clarify...   He came close to entering, as in he touched some part near the outer opening.      My nipples are slightly sore and I have minor cramps, but that could also be indicative of my period.  I've had slight bleeding and the blood started as really brown then I had some red, and now I woke up this morning and its brown again and stopped.

20090202080256AANsCyu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you think about this... help is much appreciated!?	Just over 3 months ago I had an abortion. I don't want people telling me i'm a murderer or whatever for this, it was my decision and it was best no matter how hard it was.   I was on the pill when I got pregnant and I have been for 2 years.   I carried on having sex after the abortion, with condoms for extra protection.      I had the abortion at 5 weeks, which it states there is a bigger chance of the abortion failing.   I was supposed to take a test 3 weeks after the abortion but I didn't.      So basically i'd be 4 months pregnant by now if the pregnancy hadn't ended.      My pregnancy symptoms never really stopped and my stomach has started getting bigger. I've also had to go up a bra size.      This isn't the pills doing because it's funny how the symptoms started and never stopped when I got pregnant but I never got weight gain or anything while I was on the pill before, so I really don't think it's the pill making me have pregnancy like symptoms - which people have said before.      I took a test yesterday about 8pm. I used a really cheap pregnancy test and I didn't check it until 10 minutes later. The test was negative.   But after reading the leaflet it says disregard results after 10 mins.      I have bled on my pill break since, but still do you think there's a chance i'm pregnant still, from either the abortion failing or getting pregnant again.      Is it worth taking a more expensive digital pregnancy test with my morning urine tomorow?      What do you guys think?   No nasty comments please!
20090202080345AAbZiT6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can  a home pregnancy test be wrong?	I had an extremely light period beginning on 27th january which was roughly on time. However having been off the pill for 3 years i have regularish heavy periods with three days heavy bleeding and 2 days lighter bleeding. usually red and clotty (sorry TMI). i normally suffer from painful swollen breasts, spots and cramps before period      Well i had just brown spotting for three days with about 2-3hours of pink watery flow after sex with a tiny bit of red blood (like i'd cut myself  not period) immediately on wiping after sex.      I just thought i'd had a light period but I had no symptoms before. Now a week after i'm getting really painful swollen breasts, cramping in my stomach, lower backache, feeling nauseous and feeling Absolutely tired out. Also my nipples look bigger.      So i thought i might be pregnant and took a boots own HPT this morning with first morning urine and it came up negative.      Could it be too early to tell or is something else going on?   Dr won't see me til i've had another unusual period

Was it like you woke up one day and were like, yes I am deffianlty pregnant? Did you realize before or after you missed your period?

My period isn't do until the 8th-10th. I started mild cramping in my lower back and where my low-rise jeans hit(that's the area). It's not bad-- waaaayyyyy lighter than my normal menstrual cramps. It's only the 2nd anyway, I NEVER start this early. So what could it be? Is this normal if I were to be pregnant? I read somewhere that the early pregnancy signs that you experience are a lot like premenstrual symptoms. True or False?    Also, my boobs are just a little tender. Not much but it feels like it's creepin up on me. Like the irritated throat or nose that gives you a head up a few days before you get sick. They just kinda feel sore when you poke them. I need as much information or answers that anyone can give me :)

20090202195604AA6UrN3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I kindly say "No!"?	I will start off by saying I have a very active 19 month old daughter.    Now. My sister has a friend who has two children, a 4 year old and a 14ish month old. Last night I kindly watched the two girls while the mom went to a superbowl party and my sister worked. She picked the kids up as scheduled, paid me and said she could hopefully use me as a babysitter again. That was the end of that.   Tonight, her and my sister made plans to hang out at our house and the mom asked if I would entertain the girls. I was being nice and said I would. They then decided they wanted to watch a movie with their boyfriends and asked if I could take the kids upstairs to my room for a little bit. 3 young children in a very small room = No fun and very crowded.   The 14 month old barely makes a sound, wants her mom. I take her to her mom and she brings her straight back up to me.    I am tired of them just throwing this babysitting crap on me when I have a active 19 month old of my own to watch.    Oh and each night they expect me to put the kids to bed.. easy enough with the 4 year old, but a 14 month old is hard to get to sleep in an unusal place.. so I finally took them both downstairs and she hasn't brought them back up since.   How do I translate this into "nice words?"   "No, I am tired of this babysitting crap getting throw on me at the last minute!"

I'm a bit of a hoarder if I'm honest, I find it hard to get rid of my own stuff even if I haven't worn it in years (because one day, well you know . . .

Is it just me?

20090203014429AA6Gw5m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Two soft markers on 20 week scan?	Hi      I was hoping for some advice from someone who has been in the same situation we are in at the moment. I am 23 years old and we went for the 20 week scan on Friday. They picked up two soft markers- choroid plexus cysts and echogenic foci. From this they told us that we have a 1 in a 100 chance that the baby will have a chromosomal abnormality- notably Down's Syndrome. We chose not to have the serum screening at 16 weeks because we decided we would not terminate the pregnancy if anything was picked up- so instead of worrying if it came back high risk, we decided not to take the test. Now we have this worry anyway, and I dont know how I am going to cope for the next 20 weeks not knowing what to expect. I dont feel like I can prepare myself if our baby is going to have any of these abnormalities because I dont feel that we have enough information, but I have totally stopped enjoying my pregnancy and just worry all the time. The only option the hospital have given us is an amniocentesis, but both my partner and I are really reluctant to do this knowing the risks.      Its really difficult to find any research on baby's who have two soft markers on the ultrasound... all research says to pretty much dismiss one of the markers, but doesn't really say anything is two are found.      I would be really comforted to hear from people who have been in the same situation as me and have gone on to have healthy babies???? Please help, I cant seem to get any more information from anywhere...????
20090203015902AARdKXw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Advice needed; a neighbour has to read aloud really slowly with a frown of concentration on his face when ?	reading anything, even the most simple newspaper article; when their child asks them what's wrong with them, they lash out and tell the child they are being obstreperous and argumentative. The mother is the same. When the child mentions to the father's relatives he thinks the father might be simple, they refuse even to consider the idea and tell the child no he is not, you are simple! The child is growing up confused, thinking they are bad, and wondering why their parents aren't lively and social like the other kids' parents, and very lonely. Is this a case of abuse or does the fact that the kids are being financially provided for mean it cannot be abuse or neglect?

I went to school, although it was raining this morning so there was no point in me straightening my bangs, cus they went immediately frizzy.   Then about 20 mins of raining it was full sun and stinking hot. I sweat hardcore then.       I then had to sit through 9x35 minutes of people telling me what to do and explain to me the Australian government, the basis of the Richter Scale, commissions, loss and profit and lots more. Very bad.       Then I got picked up late and had to get x-rays for my teeth. I got home at 5:30 and did 1 and a half hours of homework. Then I studied for 1 and a half hours.       2 weeks in to the start of grade nine, and it's giving me a headache haha!      I hope your day was better. I am buggered right now and it's only 8:30. Another half hour and I'll be in my bed. I'm just trying to wind down. I just did 70 math equations and my head is already asleep form that study.

20090203024749AAXCMpT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Had unprotected sex 11 days ago.gf said ok cause last period was long ago.still no period,how likely pregnant?	i came to visit her a week before this past friday and today is tuesday at about noon. we had very unsafe sex at around noon that friday.  we hadn't seen each other before that for awhile and i'm almost certain that she hadn't had sex with anyone else since her last period.  i know about the 28 day cycle/14th day ovulation etc. so if her period was more than 2 weeks before we had unsafe sex then it should be alright, but if she was slightly mistaken and it was less, then i think that we're in trouble.  i know it is my/our responsibility to be safe anyhow but i just want to know a professional's (or quasi-professional's) opinion about the likely-hood of her being pregnant. i have brought it up to her but she shrugs it off and won't get a pregnancy test.  we are both young and i know that i am fertile.  like i said, i am aware that cyclically it is very possible that she is pregnant at this point but i am very curious to know someone's opinion seeing the whole picture from the outside.  thanks a million.
20090410111433AA4iO5m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Bloody Show (yummmmmmm.... )?	My wife had a pelvic exam yesterday at her 37 week check-up, and learned she is 50% effaced an 1 cm dilated after the doc fisted her.      She has been having a ton of crampy contractions, especially after the exam yesterday - for the past week she has been having about 5 per day.    Yesterday she noticed some "brown tinted losses" continuing into this morning - she figured that the doc maybe caused a little bleeding in her cervix during the exam.    Then, this morning it seems she started losing chunks of her mucus plug - 4 or 5 times, pea-sized and bigger mucus balls (kind of brown in color). Two or three times, however, they contained streaks of fresh blood, so she called the nurse at the OB's office, who said that it is common to lose your mucus plug after a pelvic exam, and that some bleeding was normal.       Does the fact that she had the pelvic exam negate the whole "a couple of days after you have bloody, stringy, mucus losses (bloody show according to 'What to Expect...") you will go into labor" thing? Also, does it sound like the doc may have "intentionally" knocked it out to help the process along? Is that common?       Thanks!

20060724085122AACg4Hp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Spotting and Regular Period Flow?	Alright, here is the deal.  My girlfriend and I started being sexually active about a month ago.  We were careful and used condoms until she was on birth control.  In the middle of her first pack, after about a week and a half on the pill, she lost a pill and did not take another one that night.  After finishing the 21 active pills, she did not have her period for about four days.        She did have some sort of period where there was bleeding, but it only lasted about one day with a lot less flow on the days after.  It has been a few days later, and she was saying she felt nauseous this morning.  She also has tender breasts with more prominent veins, and she has felt fatigued the past few weeks.  I am wondering if the "period" she experienced was actual "spotting".  It did not look like spots, and she had to use a pad.  Any insight from someone in the medical field, or someone who has gone through this would be great.  Thanks

Eu estou certo ou sou um dinossauro pré-histórico?Na minha família sempre se discutiu isso com muita abertura e só os dois irm?os mais velho um com 35 e outro com 33 tem filhos, tenho uma irm? com 27 e outra com 25 e eu com 19 e n?o temos filhos. Como nós saimos da extrema pobreza estudando e conquistando um bom emprego, será que minha irm? menor n?o acha a sua vida fácil demais devido as suas condi?oes de vida hoje.   Como você explica esse "pequeno descuido"?(é assim que as pessoas falam)

Me and my ex boyfriend had unprotected sex January 19.  On january 30 and 31 i started spotting.  Also on the 30 I slept for 13 hours and on the 31 i slept for 11.  I went to the store to get an HPT and i took it and it came back negative.  Honestly i think i took it to early because it was only 12 days after i had sex.  The other big problem is my period is irregular so i have no clue when i ovulate.  I was just wondering was that to early to test and when should i re-test.  Also is it still a possibility that i am pregnant?

20090202093411AADEe60	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I still be pregnant? Answer ASAP PLZ!?	Okay, I went to the ER the other day because of some bleeding and was told that I was pregnant and that my level was 151, I was told to come back for further testing. I did and my levels HAD went up, however when they did an abdominal ultrasound they did not see the baby so the ER doctor told me I had a miscarriage. Now this has been 5 days ago, this morning I got up and took a home pregnancy test and it was positive, and the line was dark. My question is, shouldn't my levels have dropped enough so that an hpt wouldn't pick up a positve result? I know that you can still test positive after a miscarriage but since my levels were already so low, shouldn't they by NOW be too low to detect if it had infact been a miscarriage?
