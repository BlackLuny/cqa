That probably means continuing to support Israel and ignoring Iran's request for an apology.|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	Well, Iran is correct about the overthrow of the democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 and America's conduct in the Iran-Iraq war. Iranians are not a fundamentalist people by nature. Ahmadinejad sabre rattles against the West and Israel to remain in power, but Iran was the same country where there were HUGE pro-America rallies following 9/11. I've hear accounts from people about Tehran, and they all stated that they were surprised at how cosmopolitian the city seemed.
QnEYmSiBaa	Rush is not the producer of threats.  He is a right-wing, almost fascist blowhard who wields lots of influence due to the many politically unsophisticated people who think his simplistic solutions are correct.      He's a sham: pro-military, but legally avoided the draft during Vietnam, pro-family, but married three times, for the 'regular guy', but from a well off (lawyers, I believe) family, and an elitist himself. He's so conservative, but has had issues with the law due to prescription fraud.  Rush does incite others to hatred, though.  He's no patriot, with his sometimes almost-racial comments, and language like his recent "I hope Obama fails" .      He's just one of a long line of right wing crackpots (Father Coughlin in the 1930's, Senator McCarthy in the 1950's, etc.) that have used the modern media for their own benefit, either politically or for profit.      Maybe it's time to start  investigating guys like Limbaugh, to see whether they're  guilty of inciting violence (if there is an incident where someone appears to be a disciple of his) or hatred.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	It's not surprising at all.

I'm surprised people didn't take pot shots at Obama already, I really doubt Rush had anything to do with the rise of threats.  The democrats Ideology seems to suggest that we need more laws if you don't make a law to keep me honest then its your fault for not making the law.   As where everyone else seems to think "you know if I think its wrong maybe I shouldn't do it."  This concept for Democrats is unheard of in anyway, it is beyond them.|`|WkLJI40baa	Just like the reporter that lied about hearing deaths towards Obama during a Palin rally.

IIa4efh5aa	It's long been a recognized phenomenon that some men who have experienced a reversal of fortune cannot imagine their families going on without them, so their response is to do exactly what this man did. There are a lot of things we don't know and may never know about what was going on inside the family and what precipitated this tragedy.

But if Hamas intensifies the rocket attacks,Israel will strike as hard as it did a week ago,and after a few of such strikes,the arabs in Gaza will start to catch Hamas leaders and roast them alive in the streets of Gaza City.

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	Okay, how's this:    First, you didn't see Obama "walk into a glass door," you saw him walk into a full-length window that looks just like the door next to it.  He didn't walk into it because he was expecting "all the doors will be opened for him," but because he mistook the window for a door.  It's a simple mistake that you, of course, have never made.  Of course . . .    Second, Obama did not say he "has to do something about school kids and the dc weather."  He was simply expressing surprise and joking that the DC schools would shut down after a light snow when in Chicago, where Obama is from, the schools stay open even with much heavier snow.  And what possible difference does it make that his mother-in-law is staying with them?      Why you chose to make something out of two fluff stories is a mystery to me.  Are you truly that desperate?|`|WkLJI40baa	He was busy thinking of ways to get Rush off of the air.|`|yKA70D41aa	Good thing that he has been reminded "party is over".|`|VEoG1VCsaa	I am not a liberal by any stretch, but come on.  The guy is human and if the worst thing he does is walk into a door today, then we are good.  As for the school comments, he is right.  They never canceled school for us when we were young.  It had to snow about 2 feet for that to happen.      Don't nitpick every little thing he does.  That is what happened when Bush was president, and it was disgraceful.  Don't stoop to that level.|`|0ImX3Gy1aa	Of course I didn't see it, the media does not want to make him look bad.  If Bush had done it it would have been the lead on MSNBC.|`|YbFQuC31aa	Clear and simple proof of the media's extreme left-wing bias.  A door failed to open for Bush, every form of media was all over it with insults, jokes, and criticism constantly for months.  Same thing happens to Obama - no major media coverage at all, just whining about "nitpicking" from a few libs on the internet.

I would suggest that smokers smell an ashtray, because that's how they smell to non smokers all the time, and I am not saying that we go around smelling people's clothes, I mean when you stand next to someone in a queue, or at a bar, or even passing them in a crowded street, no amount of expensive perfume or deodorant can mask that stench.    Really whats is the up side of it?|`|xEgkc3tfaa	yes it is and i kno because i smoke|`|z9UFKK5saa	all depends from what orifice you inhale.....|`|idmz2tvraa	yeah it's gross. your hair stinks, your breath stinks, your clothes stink, your house stinks, your teeth get yellow, you get LUNG CANCER. there are no benefits to smoking.|`|wogjc0Adaa	That's a very one sided way of putting it - leading people in to agreeing with you really.

Good luck to all who are trying to quite and congratulations to all that have.|`|MklaAcnzaa	Of course, but I know how hard it is to quit and, honestly, if it wasn't such a filthy habit, I would still pay $3 or $4 a pack to smoke.

But it is just too deadly.|`|Q8coTUJfaa	Agreed, that is why I have started going to the Smoke Free NHS supported quitting program in my area.|`|4rd5IYouaa	I agree with you, I also think that an intolerant self-righteous attitude, coupled with an abiding ignorance of life circumstances is much more filthy than smoking cigarettes Try to lighten up a bit and realize that corporations are making millions of dollars off these "habits" Why don't you save your "righteous anger" for them too? If it weren't for them, you would have no one to complain about, don't they deserve at least some of your contempt?|`|f260fecd5ca5dc4eb4cded2d66649c61aa	So is eating and sex.

And it's funny how they quickly made the transition from calling Bush the antichrist to calling Obama the antichrist. Last time I checked the New Testament, there's only going to be one Antichrist.    In fact, calling someone the Antichrist is so overused, it hardly has meaning anymore.

MHkx2kRTaa	Gaza has very few real friends around the world with the exception of Iran and Syria.    Even Palestine (West Bank) has told Hamas that they are responsible for the current situation. You would have thought Palestine would have been a supporter!    The horrendous acts of Hamas using children as human shields and firing rockets from school grounds has caused most people to not support them.    Support for Israel is also mixed with some countries demanding that Israel withdraw troops.    One of the strangest outcomes has been the lack of support for Gaza from Egypt.    Egypt has closed the border and has has not offered much help other than humanitarian help.     Egypt has made it clear that they will not support Hamas and support the return of Fatah.    Not everyone in the US supports Israel but the majority certainly do not support Hamas in Gaza.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	Israel does it for me.|`|vHQsz8HHaa	The whole world is human and they side with Gaza.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	I'd say the balance has been tipped in favour of the Palestinians in light of the recent conflict.People have real difficulty understanding how so many Palestinian children have to die to satisfy Israeli voters.The imminent Israeli election is, after all,why they went in.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	I root for the Montreal Canadiens     Go Habs Go.

There may be more Gaza supporters here - doesn't mean the sample is representative. For that matter, I am monitoring most of the popular Russian forums - seems like most of Russians ally themselves with Israel (which is interesting, given that Russian government is traditionally pro-Hamas).    Plus, as Pete O said, look at the actions, not words. I don't see most of Gaza supporters willing to go fight Israel in Gaza itself, they prefer to do it from the safety of their homes. Hezbollah is sitting this one out, Egypt is anti-Hamas, so on.|`|i7oHTo9haa	More people side with Israel because if we didn't we'd all be dead.  Any civilization that has ever come across Israel has perished G-d has made certain of that.

In the brainwashed US, I would say Israel.|`|1jxxVdoQaa	I think most people in the US would side with Israel, mainly because their is a recognized terrorist group running Gaza. I bet most people in the Middle East would support Gaza, because Israel took the land from the Palestinians a while back and a lot of countries in that area don't seem to like Israel for that. I think that every once and a while Israel gets tired of RPG's flying in from Gaza and I think that they have the right to try and defend themselves, but a full out invasion is a little much. Personally I think Israel is in a bad spot with the media and they can't do much to help their situation.

I am on the Palestinians side, and believe me, I feel for them, they get bombed bt the people they have been brought up to hate, and then there own people put them in the firing line    Hamas - Death  Palestinians = Hope    They have to elect another "party" that will actually help them

6aVtiTKiaa	CNN is left leaning as Michael said.  But Fox news leans even further in the other direction.  I have heard their anchors shout down certain people during an interview, apparently for no other reason than it would be popular with their conservative audience.  Some of their favorite people to do this to are Arab and/or Muslim.  I have never seen CNN do anything even close to that to their conservative guests.    You want to see something REALLY one sided, check out HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher.  It's pretty entertaining.  Or aggravating, depending on which side you're coming from :)|`|7ab53707fb64e381599a51a3809dbddaaa	YES  and FOX news ROCKS!|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I think all the TV networks are one sided.

This is also apparent in their viewership demographics as more democrats favor CNN... I personally believe CNN appears to me to be more balanced/centered.     FOX actually does have more 'balanced' viewership though according to the article referenced below.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	No.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	CNN is a corporate media with is own agenda .

8DN2jyRsaa	it's actually a sad refection of our "i can be a celeb,without talent, obsessed,fifteen Min's of fame"culture that it takes something like this,to make women have a smear test.incredible|`|6qsocyK3aa	Are some people so stupid that they think that every woman takes notice of all the health warnings?<br>  <br>  Many women look up to Jade. Look at where she came from and look at what she turned herserf into. People are obviously going to take notice of what happens to her and therefore learn from her experiences. NHS warnings are so common and actually quite dire that I think some women are scared to go for tests. Jade is well-known and loved celebrity who has been made into a forceful example of what can happen if you have cancer. She's put cervical cancer back on  a level of understanding that everyone can grasp and proved that yes, unfortunately, it can happen to everyone. People have become desensitized to NHS warnings. Jade's plight and the shock is has caused has spread new light on this awful disease.|`|pRn1h2Hlaa	The majority of women dont realise how serious it is.

Hey im 21 and actually payed attention to my results, got treated,didnt go to india when i knew i was ill.

There are the ones who never find the elephant and so claim the elephant does not exist. There are the ones who find nirvana in someone else's buttocks.

But actually I don't believe in god, Because god could never create a spherical cube that is so heavy that god can't lift it. Which would mean the laws of logic are god. and further it is illogical to worship logic. Praying to the gravitational constant won't win the war. As Bertrand Russell once said: why do military men think it is important to read about god, I read the Bible and I couldn't find one word about how to use a hydrogen bomb not one word...         I guess the god is just a way for people to speak to an imaginary friend about their inability to deal with the insanity caused by people like themselves that is happening all around them.|`|3fd13a299603b3f5d603e1a660b1d1ecaa	In my opinion, if every different religion across the world has different god(s) and all believers think their religion is 'right', that makes them all wrong because they simply cannot all be right!

If I'm honest, I'm not a Theist, but I wouldn't say I'm a Theist, largely because you can't completely rely on Science or Religion...    It's a tricky one, seeing as different religions have different views of God.     Christians and Jews are Monotheists and believe in one God, whereas Hindus have loads of Gods, as well as Greeks.    You should gather together a council of all religions and let them battle it out...it would make an interesting debate.|`|10cnKUpxaa	There is only one 'Devinne being' as humans need something to explain the unexplainable through out the years.

AA11881071	Only if necessary ,I agree that Saturday would be the  logical day to  cut. Other  government offices are closed on Saturday so why not the Post office too.Business mail should be delivered and  processed to  keep the  staggering  economy afloat. However will additional employees or overtime  be needed to handle the flow of mail piling up over  the weekend ?|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	Saturday but only if they have too. Weekdays are bad because businesses need the mail system running when they are.
Id4OLpIZaa	Nope. Many of my classmates and friends who are in senior year or has just graduated about 2 months ago are telling me that they are having trouble finding a job. Many of them are finance majors.     I'm incredibly worried since I'm also a business student (accounting). Fortunately for me, I'm only a sophomore so hopefully the economy will get better. If worse come to worse, I'll  consider going into grad school if I cannot find a job. Affording grad school may be the issue. I'll just have to continue to work extra hard to keep my grades up which = no life.    So I'm not really optimistic about my future. I'll consider my self lucky to find a job once I enter the work force pending if the economy remains the same as today or worse. Hopefully the economy has recovered by that time.|`|BFTfzljCaa	Yup! :-)|`|A6ej3lQWaa	yep in God's name|`|oNg8zGi8aa	The future is what you make of it .

I'm not racist, but we would save millions per each state a year if we printed in just English.

8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	The name describes it. It is meant to stimulate the economy. Last year the government sent out checks to people to spend in an effort to boost consumption of goods and thus raise the economy. It didn't work too well. Now, the government wants to spend more money but this time to businesses and government organizations possibly even your city. The theory is that if they save the big businesses and banks/mortgage companies, then less people will lose their jobs/homes, etc. The problem is that the majority of the money will not "trickle down" to the individual who needs it. Anytime government wants to pass something like this, there are always favored groups/businesses that receive a huge chunk of the money-think about the money going to family planning agencies in foreign countries. How is that money supposed to help Americans? It is all a nasty game that most Americans don't bother to educate themselves about. I congratulate you for taking an interest.|`|FYXxRSCfaa	The  stimulus package is ridiculous -- it's packed with spending that has nothing to do with stimulus!!!       It includes hundreds of millions of dollars for seemingly unrelated projects, like $50 million for the National Endowment of the Arts and repairs to the Smithsonian museum totaling $150 million. Other spending measures in the bill earmark over $330 million to programs that educate teens about STDs and sending $600 million over to NASA to study climate change. Additionally, the bill would use $200 million to cosmetically improve the National Mall in Washington D.C. and budget $670 million to maintain and rebuild restrooms and other buildings in our national parks!    You all wanted "change".... thats all you'll have a pocket full of "change"!       Can we screw em...Yes we can!

If you are referring to the latest one the ceasefire only related to inside Gaza itself. Hamas attacked an Israeli patrol outside the area  If this cease fire related to the whole of Palestine look at what Israel are doing in the West Bank  Your link was dated 28th Jan . by Israeli News ?. Can you come up with something more up to date and less biased.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	'Cause Israelis are keeping Palestinians trapped. Even a squirrel will attack you if you trap her.|`|ytQfxuPyaa	Funny how the news is reported that way, but israel has never really stopped bombing and shelling Palestine. Even in the hours and days just after announcing a ceasefire after the recent massacre, Israel continued.  The western media always report that Israel has declared a ceasefire, but they don't alway report that they are still dropping bombs on Palestine. Clever media control..|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Maybe, or maybe not. It isn't clear that it was Hamas, with plenty of other nutcases running loose in Gaza. The Israelis, of course, hold Hamas responsible, since they are running the show.|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	You misspelled Israel. I-S-R-A-E-L, there you go.

NANppnhlaa	As several people have already pointed out, the majority of Pacific Brands products have already been produced in China for years now - at least 5 years that I can recall.<br>  <br>  We're all to blame for this - producers AND consumers. Producers because they are always after the biggest possible profit. Consumers because we ALL demand quality products at the cheapest possible price. <br>  <br>  We're now given ourselves very little alternative because we've driven profit and competition overseas. This isn't just about clothing - have a look at all the other primary production we've driven overseas. We're reliant on other countries for so many of the things we consider essential. It's embarrassing.<br>  <br>  And don't just blame Asia and/or China in particular. If you factor in the amount of goods we import from other parts of the world it's even more embarrassing.<br>  <br>  The one underhand factor here is the timing - Pacific Brands is trying to use the economic downturn to do something they were already planning. They should have been honest and upfront.|`|EkMvHJk8aa	i will buying less of them now that they are not going to be australian made|`|qtzWVlrbaa	I will not buy the clothes anymore if they are not Aussie made|`|4wCfFiSyaa	yes the sizes always come back too small|`|4WQYbnCGaa	It's free trade and unsustainable mass consumption facilitated by easy to get credit that has caused the GFC - Bonds has been buying factories overseas for years - is the manufacturing going to the factories they own overseas? No-one seems to be asking that question - they may just be using this as an opportunity to do something they planned anyway only now it's convenient under the shroud of GFC. <br>  <br>  Because Australia has bought into free trade hook line and sinker there will soon be nothing that is made here - and there was information in the media last year that within 5 years 80% of all food here will come from overseas as well. <br>  <br>  Party's over kids - get used to it. The time to be active and buy Australian made was in the past when you could have been working to prevent this trend. Australian made is mostly "from local and imported ingredients" now too. <br>  <br>  I need undies - I'll buy what I can afford as long as it's made of cotton - grown in Australia but sucking up all the water that could be used to grow food and feed the Murray Darling - see how its all connected and never ending....|`|2KT93P0Jaa	As now, I don't like to buy anything made in China, so answer is YES|`|DRdxrRE5aa	Ever since my family and I arrived in Australia and called it home, I have patronize Aussie made products. Now, with Pacific Brands going to China for their products, I'm sorry but I won't buy them any more.<br>  Anyway, I never did patronize any thing made in China. I've had very bad experiences with their quality. Would any sane mind expect anything better from a person being paid - the highest salary - $2 a day?|`|aiWz1fjAaa	Actually Pacific Brands have been using off shore manufactures for sometime and many brands were already manufacturing o/seas when acquired by PB but the intention was to bring manufacturing back to Australia.<br>  Unfortunately the bottom dropped out of the market and they were left with little choice.<br>  Maybe bonds will be back? <br>  <br>  Also many of their brands are part of the 'No Sweat Shop' organisation.<br>  So even though it is not profitable to manufacture in Australia they are at least an company who thinks ethically.|`|XFn2RqgMaa	will pat rafter and michael clarke continue doing the ads|`|EYmwcIHXaa	If these quality brands are manafactured offshore, they will naturally lose their reputation for quality very quickly as so many other clothing brands have already. Any brand's value must be constantly reinforced with quality products which are seemingly almost impossible to source from China etc. Without such natural reinforcement through continuous and reliable quality, the brand becomes just an empty name with little very little else behind it. Accordingly, no, I would stop buying immediately and seek local quality elsewhere.|`|X2LBZyXSaa	Hell yeh, i'm gonna burn all my bonds undies. Fat cats are unbelievable|`|eN2j5JW9aa	if you read the tags, half of the bonds clothes are already made in china!|`|96bVfIlYaa	I was so disappointed with the company's decision as these are brands I buy all the time.  As long as the quality wasn't compromised though, I would have continued to buy them.  <br>  <br>  However, after reading the news article this morning about the executives giving themselves massive pay increases, then NO I will write them off entirely and change brands.  I think these people should be charged with a criminal offense such as fraud or whatever the appropriate charge is.  These people are criminals and it is this sort of corporate greed that has put the world in its current woeful situation.|`|AA12047903	Check your labels people!   I buy bonds undies for my family and the labels clearly state "Designed in Australia Made in CHINA" now! <br>  Obviously there are some items still made in Australia but the bonds in our wardrobes are China made anyway.  What items are actually made here?  It seems there is very little Australian made anything - and we have the unions to thanks for that as Australian labour is too expensive and business have no option but to take their manufacturing off shore to make them competitive.  Its all very good to have fair wages for Aussie workers but the reality is the items then become too expensive compared to items made overseas.  Harsh but true.   Boycotting Pacific Labels is pointless.  What are you going to buy instead?  Something made in India or Pakistan?  It still won't be Aussie made.|`|HCUVOQCnaa	yes definitely.I only support jobs for australians even if it costs a bit extra.|`|vnCqJHS7aa	NOW is the time, for any aspiring entrepreneur with a sense of Australian (and remaining so) to step into the fold and make themselves known and take on, an already trained workforce.<br>  <br>  In a simple answer to your question - yes, I will stop buying. I did buy Yakka and King Gee, with the latter as the better made. The other suggested that with the quality of the material, it was already made overseas.|`|DomjuaRBaa	I will see how I go.  We can not stop buying from Bonds as this put more workers working in Australia at risk of loosing jobs.  They are changing according to the economic conditions.  They have to do this for survival otherwise they will vanish.  Yes it hurts 1800 jobs were lost but think won't more jobs be lost if the company went bankrupt and they had to close the whole operation.  It is better to support them so they come back to Australia and support them to be Australian Brand and also keep them updated with your views how you want them to bring jobs back to Australia.  This crisis is for everyone and everyone supporting each other will help everyone to come out of it.  This recession is global.  Only positive thoughts and actions will bring everyone out of it.  So please reconsider and think with calmly.<br>  We do not want more workers to loose jobs in the Bonds so we should still support them but still keep them updated that we will like them to bring the operation to Australia.|`|QKnPbJ6Daa	What a disappointment for the Australian of course but I guess most of the garments available in Australia is made off-shore anyway.  I am very uncertain if I will look for the particular brands as I don't think the brands is matter.  I actually shop from second hand shops and hardly spend on garments. I do agree we all should support Australia made brands.|`|ZsyAbu59aa	I will definitely cease to buy Bonds and more especially King Gee now that they will no longer be made in Australia.  I find most items made in China are cheap,inferior products in terms of fabric, quality and workmanship. I have endeavoured (hard as it is) over the past few years to avoid purchasing anything made in China.  My husband is a tradesman who has always worn King Gee clothing so I will buy in bulk immediately to ensure we have a few years worth of stock in the wardrobe.  I will now have to start the search for an Australian brand of work clothing (if there is such a thing left).|`|3SdiQ7k4aa	Who cares about Oz? Go USA.|`|KvzkgvMcaa	I will stop buying these brands if they arent ozzie made.. ozzie ozzie ozzie oi oi oi!  I have been a faithful bonds girl for many years.. i have only liked that brand for my undies... i guess i have to find another brand. i have purchased the other brands as well in the past.<br>  Come on Pacific Brands dont be losers give the jobs back to the ozzies.. the workers are prepared to negotiate so they keep thier jobs..|`|kQfmmzwOaa	It's not a big deal where it's made. people are'nt going to rip out your underwear and ask you where it's made.  You can't help it when big companies fall into a category of "greed", paying $10 a week to asian teenagers to do the job. You gotta consider that australia's living expense is very high compare to china and operating a factory and paying wages is costly in australia. When china's living expense goes up  you will see a lot more stuff made in india, which is happening. You just have to blame it all on the greedy manufacturers for this, not which country it is made from.|`|bjgBaDZCaa	Absolutely. How much more are going to give to the bloody asians. Pauline Hanson 4 P.M.|`|gMOyGANYaa	yes, they're only interested in profits, not people.|`|xk7nL3bpaa	People - a majority of Pacific Brands gear has been made overseas for YEARS! There are only a few brands they make here locally and now those are gone.<br>  King Gee and Yakka brands have been chinese made for years.<br>  Australia - we are STUPID! <br>  We have the ability to be the only country in the world that can be fully self sufficient, but we continue to go down the price price price cheap cheap cheap mentality. If you want cheap - be prepared for the crap you buy and dont whinge when jobs are lost. If you want to support Aussie Made then be prepared to pay a few bucks extra. You all want better wages and better lifestyle - how do you think that gets paid for?<br>  Ooops - too late - the whole Australian Manufacturing market is stuffed and we only have ourselves to blame. <br>  Well done Australia, well done.|`|AA12305050	They should change their name to Asian Brands now!<br>  <br>  I used to prefer their lines because it meant supporting Australian jobs. There's no point in bothering anymore. As far as I'm concerned they are no longer Aussie since their product certainly isn't. Sure, they've reacted to extreme pressure from the voracious and predatory Australian banks who don't seem to give a shite about who they screw but their decision has really kicked a lot of people and the local economy and general morale while it was already down. How "un-Australian"!<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that if their products are manufactured in Asia that not only will the quality be inferior but they'll be using less raw materials from Australia too (if any) so our other related industries will also be affected.<br>  <br>  I wonder if the company's directors considered reducing their own perks and bonuses as an alternative. Probably not but this desperate move could well spell the end of Pacific Brands.|`|IZ1nLtKOaa	I love Bonds underwear and have always bought their products because of the quality and material. I always try to buy Australian products and whenever I'm shopping. But, it's always been hard to look for Australian made products(clothing esp!)<br>  <br>  Haven't made up my mind yet if I'll still buy their products with everything so expensive now days. I feel for the people that have lost their jobs tho especially now with everything going on.|`|1ZRwi6I0aa	definately|`|CAkzaNw2aa	absolutely.actually i feel betrayed|`|b1nsvu7xaa	No I wouldn't buy these brands anymore. When these brands go overseas|`|fff844f73eb7689a8e03dee9bd445e75aa	yes|`|bZ5tkRKdaa	no way. i know bonds for quality, not where it is made.|`|3d4066e9d390d7572f7fba8f29f1f832aa	Not that I go out of my way to buy these specific brands ( I do have bonds products in my draws), every time in the future when im looking for clothes and i see the labels Bonds and King Gee it will always bring back memories of the recent bad news and will most definitely put me off buying them unless they sre cheaper than anything else.|`|UqIrVOxzaa	I will definitely ban Bonds from my shopping list for taking the business overseas and abandoning us.We have other undies in the stores that are equally as good and are cheaper than Bonds my motto <br>  " everyone can be replaced" this may come back to bite them.|`|TiD3kQKzaa	BLOODY OATH|`|8zIzHPMCaa	Bond clothes are generally more expensive than others and have been made in China or other off-shore for many years now. My guess is we have been paying for the high priced advertising. So, I will continue to buy some Bond lines, as usual. And, as usual only when they are on sale.|`|915dVhJgaa	No I won't.  Bonds and Berlei were my favourite undies and the main reason I won't be buying them again is that just about every time I buy an article of clothing that is made in China, it is sown so badly that it is almost impossible to iron properly.  It seems to be the sleeves they can't get right so the undies will most likely not fit properly.  Most of the stuff made there is CRAP!!!|`|5vw7S7ZJaa	This is the cost of globalisation....<br>  <br>  They can make the same product to the same quality for probably a tenth of the cost.<br>  <br>  It would be irresponsible if they didnt move off shore to china.<br>  <br>  I was looking in the paper and some of these people have been at the company for 15 or 20 years. Doing the same job. Workers need to realise that they need to continually up grade thier skills and thier employability. No one in this new generation of workers will be able to be in the same job for 15 years.<br>  <br>  If i owned the company and someone said to me. "My factory can make the same product for 10 perecent of the manufacturing cost" i would say wehere do i sign? Subject to the quality being comparable.<br>  <br>  These chinese factory workers work harder, longer and for a lot less money.<br>  <br>  They had a pretty good run, so stop complaining. <br>  <br>  P.S i dont here anyone complain when they can buy cheap chinese goods. Anyway the quality of chinese goods is only as good as the factory and the management. Take for example iphones. They are assembled in china and are at the top of quality. <br>  <br>  Next to move offshore.... car manufacturing....<br>  <br>  Stop the government subsidies of industries in this country that cant turn a profit... Hasnt anyone realised that australia makes terrible cars?|`|GGGTXJTRaa	I am a huge fan of Bonds, but i want to know what this label "made in australia" is on the clothes???? last night i was checking my underwear labels, as well as my bonds trackies and tee shirts etc.. and i have nothing with the made in australia Label in it and none of these thing are recent purchases, majority more than 2 years...... whats going on,|`|217b09cad4499d84073afef0392b44b2aa	Yes- they are still Australian owned- unlike so many of the clothes in our stores these days. I congratulate Pacific Brands being made in Australia as long as they have- they were one of the last large brands still manufacturing in Australia. It is better than move production overseas to cut costs, rather than the whole business going under and losing these brands all together.|`|AA12210416	well to be honest i never bought them anyway. australia has never had nor ever will have a good manufacturing industry so i try to buy things that look good, first and are cost effective, second.<br>  <br>  sympathy to all those who lost their jobs though!<br>  <br>  times are tough... :(|`|BnsJqcEuaa	no i don't care<br>  <br>  carla|`|TZiTMhypaa	Some time ago, I worked for PB and even then most of the brands you have mentioned in your question were 'then' being manufactured 'outside' of Australia. So... in answer to your question, NO, as buying 'actual' Aussie made stuff is getting increasingly harder to do. One has to wear clothes, whether they are from here or there is unfortunately no longer going to be an option.  <br>  On a side note... the use of the word 'iconic' is inappropriate here, just as it is inappropriate when used in nowadays conversations, etc. Recommend a look-see in a dictionary for the word 'icon'.|`|Nzgp6Wcnaa	Clothes are clothes people. I doubt that you would rather walk around naked than wear items that are made in China. I understand that alot of people have lost their jobs, but I myself know how they feel, I was made redundant by the mine I was working at along with 150 other people, it sucks, so what, get over it, move on. I will still be buying the Bonds brand and any other brand that is made overseas, it I like it I will buy it, regardless of what country it was made. Comfort is the issue here.|`|7D1CR6FOaa	There is no way I will buy thier products anymore, i didn't buy all that many before though. But my partner only wore bonds t-shirts, singlets and holeproof jocks and I will be making sure he changes. If so many companies are sending work overseas while the damn government is bring more immigrants here then Australia, (sorry to sound racist) will have no jobs for australians that have grown up here for generations.<br>  This country is going down the hole.|`|zSFI78eqaa	I am quite annoyed that companies are using the so called global situation to go off shore.<br>  That is all it is.  Did we see this uproar when Levis jeans left Australia - or the optical company who closed their South Australian lab. and went off shore. This company is just going to work in an area where the wages will be less and I am sure that we the stupid public will still pay the same amount as though the goods were manufactured here.<br>  It is time to stand up and reclaim our "farm"<br>  The amount of companies becoming monsters and forcing the Australian owned small companies to the wall is increasing.<br>  We will only succeed when Australians start to  question the ownership of companies. Then purchase from the businesses that promote Australian jobs.<br>  I will not purchase their products if I see the made OS label.<br>  We should, when we go in to stores, d query the ownership, and vote with your feet when the company has its profits going off shore! .|`|7oVTuZX7aa	Definately I always buy my hubby King Gees  because they are Australian, Reckless Rudd didn't prop up our own businesses and keep Australians employed rather than hand our business to the Chinese and pay out billions with hand outs to people who never have or never will pay taxes, running around the world like a drunk with a cheque book.<br>  <br>  SOURCE:<br>  <br>  A neibour has got 7 kids 3 different fathers received about 10 Grand just before Christmas has never been employed and will get another $7,000 next hand out, pity he dosn't show a bit of empathy to old aged and disability pensioners|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Won't be spending my cash on their stuff anymore.|`|8cfvN5voaa	oh i didnt even know that they werent made in china.. although, on my hubbys label it says "designed in australia" & "mad ein china".. and i got them during xmas time from Target....<br>  <br>  well, hey, if the product costs less because its not made here, i say i will definetely buy if not even more!!|`|5TNmNHkEaa	Hell YES! I will NOT be buying these brands when they are no longer made in Australia. It is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  They say they are in a tough time and losing money. Yet the CEO and so on still take home checks in the 6 figure mark each year. They are simply trying to make themselves more money and in doing so their GREED will lose them more money than they ever imagined. <br>  <br>  A very stupid move on their behalf and should have only be done if they were breaking even, which they are NOT.<br>  <br>  I hope you corporate monkeys lose soooooo much money after this massive mistake your GREED has caused you to make. You better apologise and fix it ASAP....but it's too late and your company will now have to become big overseas so you fools don't go bankrupt. Australia has spoken and officially hate you!|`|e72ee774f8daf9ca729e809880c5d0f6aa	If you will only consider goods made in Australia, I am afraid you will not have much to put on by way of manufactured goods. I guess you can bypass this by just wearing as liitle as we can, go to the beaches, lie naked, walk barefooted. We can act, we can swim, we can play... after all who wants to make money the hard way. Only slum dog millionaires make money the hard way. "They" save and work like mad, we play and enjoy like mad and we sell them good old fashion toxic "sophisticated" derivative products and services and they won't know the difference would they?|`|MBu8ZXeRaa	I won't _stop_ buying them, but I won't _preference_ buy them either.<br>  <br>  When all other options are equal, I'll buy Australian made, so that gives Australian made products an advantage.  Bonds just gave up that advantage.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Good question! Though from what I can gauge most clothing these days is manufactured overseas anyway. To be honest I didn't even realise that Bonds/King Gee was "Made in Australia", just thought they played the patriotic card because they originally started in Oz.<br>  <br>  A bit like Vegemite and other "Aussie icons" -- bought out by multinationals...|`|Iuleao79aa	Yes I will they won't be Australian any more will they, <br>  they were getting to dear to buy the baby cloths are a rip off|`|PJ8nzTUZaa	absolutely|`|cuo27bcIaa	As individual Australians we can make a statement together and show how we ALL feel about this:  <br>  <br>  Join the Facebook group 'Keep Pacific Brands Jobs in Australia' !!|`|Pvmsagqvaa	dont think it wud make a diference anyway. it IS already made in china. so wats wrong with buyin them, there gud anyway. =)|`|ZaYdUOXCaa	no. having their stuff manufactured somewhere else cuts the cost to make. but also you pay for what you get so it will become just like ginsu the knife brand. cheap and....|`|7TETMPpYaa	Where possible, I always make the effort to buy Australian-made product as what goes around comes around. After all, who is going to support our local economy if we don't?|`|ubGm001Eaa	Bonds already charges a lot more than other brands when some cheaper brands last as long as Bonds.|`|6ty3vizaaa	yes  i will think twice about   Ithink its terrable  we need to keep it Australain to keep Aussie jobs  its only makeing a bigger problem  sending  the labels and colthes offshore|`|AA11128932	YES I willl stop buying these brand names<br>  i always take care to pick Aussie Made stuff.<br>  What has the Govt been doing?<br>  Where are they when the workers need them?|`|oJDtCqCQaa	Without question! I am absolutely sick of Australian products being sent offshore to manufacture.|`|iXX0QzvXaa	Absolutely ! Won't be buying anything from Bonds, King Gee or any of those people anymore, and that's a Fact Jack !|`|mX6qBWuNaa	Even if we didn't have the economic down turn the world is having now, it would be most likely that "Pacific Brands" would have taken their manufacture off shore.<br>  As it stands there was little option for them if they wished to stay in business. <br>  <br>  Against them are their own shareholders who are going too put their money were they can reap the most profit.<br>  <br>  Against them are their own work force, unions and government who will not allow a lowering of wages and conditions.<br>  <br>  Against them is the overseas competion, where some produce goods at an equal quality at a lower price.<br>  <br>  Against them is the overseas worker with much harder conditions to contend with than our Australian work force.<br>  A work force that in some cases has to accept what ever condition are offered just to survive.<br>  <br>  It would seem that all "Pacific Brands" have left is the good will of the Australian buyer.<br>  <br>  As for myself as an age pensioner, I stopped buying the more expensive goods long ago!!|`|rM8JuM2uaa	In fact, now i'll start buying their products. I never used before just because of the price, they don't worth the price they charge for. Just for the sake of the label "Made in Australia" they were charging more money as they knew aussie's will buy blindly if something is made in australia. <br>  now since it will be made in china/asia, we'll get same quality with lot more cheaper price.<br>  It looks like Australia is made in China...|`|0f6fnZ76aa	I will definitely NOT buy any of those brands. This company has taken the food from the table of hardworking Aussies & provided jobs in another country. They have not supported our economy so we definitely should NOT support them. Go BRA-LESS & UNDI-LESS if we have to.<br>  Do we have any undies work wear made in Australia now?|`|UVh7Anbjaa	No. Senior management of many companies have lost the plot. They look at balance sheets, profit ratios, cost prices per item, and that's it. What they forget is that employees are people. They have put the dollar value ahead of a human value.  They can expect a savage backlash, because people support each other, and anger at retrenching hundreds of Australians will be directed at the company. It is time a company in Australia showed true leadership and showed by their actions that they value people far more than a paper dollar value.<br>  The people in the world are emotional beings, a paper dollar is not.|`|2Fv4qziqaa	Yes. They could have easily dropped their two spokes people (Pat Rafter and Sarah Murdoch, like they need anymore money) to save money, jobs and keep the manufacturing in Australia. Also i'm pretty sure that the CEO and the other really high paying fuddy duddies, could have taken a $20000 pay cut pretty easily and still be able to afford their Truffle infused coffee served in a diamond encrusted coffee cup. But like any other company, they aren't content with making a profit they have grow every year, so they f*** everyone else off just in order to keep profiting. And furthermore their products are going to decrease in quality anyway, so why the hell would we pay the same price for lesser quality products! Bollocks to Pacific Brands, i say lets revolt, Rage Against the Machine people!!! haha|`|0850chEYaa	That has not been Australia history....in the main!<br>  You only have to look what has already been sold off going back to Hawke and Keating and the "masters' of the sell-off the previous Howard government. Of course this has come back to bite us on the bums but it's all about the old "hip pocket nerve".<br>  <br>  Those with wealth buy any and all the best whether it be Australian or foreign i.e. cars clothes building materials etc.<br>  <br>  This will be no different but if a "National Black Ban was to be imposed I would support the "ban" that was when Australia had a "back bone! Don't remember, most wouldn't....no surprises!|`|DAGRJ00kaa	Of course, why support companies that aren't willing to support our country|`|x4CNUXYyaa	I will not buy anything from Pacific Brands if they move offshore.<br>  Yes some stuff has been made offshore already and I think the QUALITY HAS ALREADY BEEN AFFECTED in some stuff.<br>  I think it the one thing that the americans get right, buy your own and support your own.<br>  That starts at the government level..... Don't even let it get in to the country I say!|`|GzFcTC0Kaa	Absolutely. The only good thing about these products is that they are strong, tough and Aussie made. Asia is not known for it's quality products and so in my eyes, and most other people's, Bonds and King Gee are no longer considered quality products.<br>  <br>  And if we can't support workers in our own country then who can we support.<br>  <br>  Another Aussie icon bites the dust.|`|shHjD5I6aa	Yes, I will definitely reconsider buying from these once iconic Aussie brands!  I am a fervent supporter of Australian Made wherever possible, providing Aussie jobs and keeping income & tax dollars here to strengthen our own economy.  It sickens me when I am reminded, yet again, that the greed for an ever larger profit margin (the directors & executives rarely miss out!) will almost always result in businesses going 'offshore', leaving us, the faithful, an ever diminishing array of 'Aussie Made' choices, not to mention the shrinking of employment opportunities.  Where has the pride of 'Proudly Australian Made' gone?|`|l05ejqziaa	Definitely. Ever since moving to this country it has been a huge bug bear of mine that nearly all clothing stores get their products from China. I would happily pay more money for Australian made. My two boys and I buy Bonds underwear range for this very reason, sadly no more.|`|y71cymTgaa	If they've sold out (of) the country why should the country support them.<br>  <br>  As a manufacturer they will be just another company exploiting cheap sweatshop labour in the third world, like any other.<br>  <br>  No doubt they will plug the "We're doing it for ourshareholders" and bombard us with jingoistic advertising to try and regain ground.<br>  <br>  But as far as I'm concerned I'll never by any of their brands again.<br>  <br>  You can't blame poor third world countries from trying to make a buck - But you can blame a 1st world company from selling out their employees, even with the offer of Federal Government funding, for convenience & cheaper overheads.<br>  <br>  I bet the CEO & Board are in no fear of loosing their jobs.<br>  <br>  Thoroughly Disgusted|`|TGT7vCQfaa	Bond singlets are the best... NOT no more..... What a way to pay your loyal employees... who gives a **** that you have keep so many other jobs woopie dooo for you  what are people going to do now.. bet you didnt cut your income!!!!!!!!   for years they said support australia well what happened to that where has it gone i know  CHINA!!!!!!! Quick fixes are fab aren't they   but for who.......<br>                                      regards <br>                                             kylie<br>                                                                        gilgandra  n.s.w|`|v3UEO2dRaa	It is so tempting to go for the cheaper ooption when buying colothing, but in the end we lose when the jobs go out the window. Spend a bit more and keep the Aussie made stuff afloat. I will definitely be looking for the Australian made alternative. Bisley is australian made workwear and it's better than king gee and the same price.|`|Ln3OlpEZaa	Bonds are tacky there like holden and ford cars, l like quality like ck or oroton like the porche or lamborgini .. nothing worse than taking a man home only to strip him down to his bonds yuk!! no class, never bought their products never will. australian products should be made by australian people that l agree with. everything is going off shore in the name of cost cutting, if its a service or goods that are australian generated then it should STAY in australia. telecommunication, energy, clothing just a few services made in australia but serviced by call centres in India, our aussie companies are very un-australian|`|layFyq6naa	Definately not.  What's the point!  We are constantly bombarded with advertising to "Buy Australian" but how can these brands justify being Australian if there products are being made overseas.  Besides, how long will it take for the quality to decline???  Not long I'm sure!!  And will the prices come down.  I doubt it.  So the cheaper brands are looking good and with cheaper prices it's a win / win situation for the consumer.|`|AA11596050	I bought my hole proof underwear from Bonds last month and realised last week i got couple holes on it! I check the label and very disappointed that the label showed."MADE IN CHINA".  I hate my "used to be good" underwears are now just a chinese cheap junk like other brands...|`|5fzheTTZaa	no|`|zO8m7Zsoaa	Absolutely never touch any of those products again until they are made back here in australia. I don't buy any imported goods unless it's unavoidable, even if i have to pay a little more. They can go to hell, especially the over paid executives of that company.|`|4QNgtZjzaa	absolutely NOT... it has been well proven that once the company heads off shore the quality of the product decreases dramatically. I no longer trust these brands. the quality that we once relied on is gone. <br>  I was always a big supporter of Blundstone but the boots i purchased lately since the company went offshore are already falling apart. The previous pair that were manufactured in Australia lasted me 8 years. I no longer purchase Blundstone products.<br>  <br>  I am personally fed up with our companies heading overseas & the product becoming inferior.|`|AA11733644	yes|`|TIUlxlyCaa	i was a fan of the bonds brand,but now i will never but from them again,if they want to leave Australia and go overseas.Then i will be looking elsewhere,considering the price we pay here for them, will that change?,i don't think so.Another greedy company wants more money in there pokets,i wil be buying the cheaper brand, BAD BONDS|`|DZnizb3qaa	good!!! at least now they will be cheaper!|`|sTKe93AQaa	of course i stop buying these products. we are suppose to be encouraging people to buy Australian products and trying to keep the employment rate up and all we are doing is deeping ourselves into a bigger hole. Anna Bligh thinks shes gonig to help stop us from losing jobs but now this is happening. She will use alopt of votes now wont she.|`|TCc7niv3aa	Once I realised that wannabee-Beckham chump Michael Clarke was a brand ambassador I vowed to purchase no more "Reg Grundies" bearing the Bonds label. The final straw was Pacific Brands taking its operations offshore. They don't deserve to advertise themselves as an iconic Aussie product any more. Boycott the b@st@rds I say!|`|lS9WRAw4aa	What is made in Australia???? Not much<br>  I am afraid to say 50% of things we eat or wear are made of shore brought back into the country and resold. Why stop now<br>  Look at vegemite i bet you still eat that and not complain..<br>  Our government has not got the guts to stand up and argue or even fight to stop jobs from going off shore, yes the Rudd government new about this and done nothing about it.|`|N1hCAoFQaa	yeh|`|6V4UNpibaa	It is an absolute shame that the manufacturing of Pacific Brands will now be off shore.  Lets hope that the quality of the product doesn't drop.  Whilst I am really disappointed that they are taking their manufacturing off shore they are still Australian owned so we should still support them though I am now looking for another brand that is Australian made and owned.  Also, perhaps Kevin Rudd should take the same stance as USA and cap Executive Salaries as I would be really interested to see how hard Pacific Brands truely tried to keep the manufacturing here in Australia; that is besides taking government handouts.|`|AIvc3DQfaa	Were they ever even Aussie made? I think they're just designed here not made here. That's the same with heaps of products though, like Ipods.. they're designed in California but made in China.<br>  <br>  I think the main thing is that the material in their clothing is from Australia. So if that changes then the quality will go down.|`|zIEbpo3Faa	Many of these products are already made in China, however I shan't be spending the extra few dollars to buy their T-shirts and singlets if they are no longer made here.<br>  This is a another sad episode in the history of manufacturing in Western countries, but not a surprise. Maximum profit is all that matters to business. If they tell you otherwise, they're treating you like a fool. Your job and those of your friends and families don't matter.|`|RGQtQNyzaa	The only reason I did purchase them before was that they were Aussie made, they have always been kind of cheap and nasty, and they don't last as long as they should, but now they are making them offshore, I may as well buy the cheap stuff from the markets because I will be saving money and not rewarding the mongrels that undercut our way of life and stole our countryfolks jobs. It makes me sick and angry and I will boycott all Pacific Brands labels from now on.|`|U19AW0B1aa	If they are going offshore then they are placing themselves in the same bin as generic offshore brands (at lower offshore brand prices and quality). There is now no longer a reason (ie.buying Aussie made), to pay the extra and support the local brand. The Aussie brand names Bonds, Holeproof etc. will no longer have any meaning and in reality will cease to exist. It will be like manufacturing a car that is called a Holden Commodore with Holden Commodore badges, but for some reason looks and goes like a Tianjin Xiali??? In Australia there is no reason to remain loyal to this brand any longer.|`|YzFcGlyWaa	In theory, yes but in reality, as a sole parent of two teenagers, I will search for the most value for money clothes I can supply them. Having said that....I feel strongly that I should boycott Pacific Brands!  <br>  I fear that this is just the beginning...................|`|aGU67kZMaa	king gee is australia......until they move over seas.. goodbye|`|bbVOtWwjaa	Unfortunately there is not much option as most of clothing industry is from offshore, but I don't believe the financial crisis is the cause for the move, more the chance to make it, and not seem like a bunch of greedy bastards by blaming something else other than their poor management.|`|XIV9Vzdqaa	Well yes because they are no longer Aussie made. Pacific Brands is an American company and surprise surprise they buy up the competition ie bonds etc try make a profit then dump it as soon as they cant make  a decent profit. It sheer American greed and Corporate culture Crap.<br>  <br>  You will find these will now be made overseas. Any excuse to produce overseas lower overheads and can pay the workers less. Again sheer American greed. Americans caused this global crisis. Americans totally hopeless and despicable in business.Rarely do the right thing.|`|6NxlSnmqaa	It won't affect my purchasing decision at all, in fact looking at the labels its hard to find the Aussie made logo. However I do sympathise with the staff who received this bad news yesterday.<br>  But as some people have already commented, I do question the timing and this big convienent excuse of the Global Economic Crisis.<br>  Rubbish, the senior execs would of been planning this for a couple of years now, watching their profits drop as overheads rose.But hey, while the Govt. is throwing money around willy nilly, why not.|`|RtyjzKAXaa	No i  will not. In my opinion this is an act of betrayel to the people of australia.  The people in charge aught to bite the bullet and wait, like we all have to, untill the economy gets  better. I will definatly not be buying their products|`|JMYN9s2Gaa	Mates stick together ethically, turn your back on your own & you're out for good. If I need to be more straight forward then Pacific Brands can get well & trully & yes buying Calvin Klein is buying from OS, it's a better product & the money is still going to the same place. Guess what brand my undies will be now & Bonds are going in tonights garbage.<br>  Millsy|`|jQvjZffQaa	No as the facts remain this is a world economy and every time a company goes offshore its all doom what a croc.<br>  <br>  In case you don't no alot of raw material is bought from country's like Australia to make these  products from manchester to machinery in the first place but don't see the chinese or other asian countries complaining.<br>  <br>  No they just get on with it , yes its sad that jobs are lost but hey why pay 15 for a bonds tshirt which was made here and frankly quality isn't that superior to some cheaper no brand chinese product as i buy 3 for the price of 1 and guess what in alot  of  cases they've out lasted the supposedly better quality bonds.<br>  <br>  More like paying for a name in most cases.|`|np7mVlHKaa	yes|`|9w89CVMPaa	My main issue is the human rights abuse that comes with the manufacture of a lot of clothing - the fact is, Chinese stuff is so cheap because Chinese workers are paid peanuts and treated like crap - I prefer to buy second hand because it has less impact on the environment, and because it is not directly supporting companies who exploit workers. The price tag of vinnies gear is also appealing.|`|yqlen7r9aa	No. In terms of Bonds they are of good quality, comfortable and affordable. It is unfortunate that they had to fire so many people around the nation but they haven't fired everyone (there are still jobs in Australia). This shows the current global economic crisis (whatever its being called... I don't know) is affecting everyone someway or another as well as the BIG names/brands and companies. <br>  <br>  The had to what they had to do. Try to look at it from a business prospective. If you think about it, wouldn't it be better that they let a few people go than closing down the whole company? Labour is cheap China, so I would think thats the main reason they are moving jobs there. Hopefully when this economic crisis comes to pass, they will return the jobs to Australia. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, they are still an Aussie brand<br>  <br>  ... at least they haven't been sold to China (like vegemite was sold to America..(correct me if im wrong. it may have just been i rumour but i thought the company was sold to America) ???)|`|oe3PyH3Vaa	yes|`|opnuFX0xaa	No, definitely not, if it's something I need.  Some of these products are already manufactured overseas as it is.  The economic crisis is worldwide and buying only Australian made products is protectionism, equal to people in other countries not buying anything which is made in this country.  Where would our export industry be if this were the case?|`|ESqvtWb0aa	I think it is terrible that we are losing everything that is Australian to overseas. It will not be of the same standard and it will not be Oz.The government should do something to assist these companies that are in financial hardships let alone the amount of jobs lost here. Oz govt needs to wake up!!! I will no longer purchase these products.|`|WSCRgn8haa	No.|`|srcG0OtIaa	yes|`|l3i4QLIyaa	I  enjoy buying only Australian made and Australian grown products  because I feel good that by spending my money on such local goods and services  that  I am in some small  way helping other Australians and Australian businesses . I want the money that I spend to stay in  Australia . The only time  I detour is when I very occasionally buy NZ products such as cheese .<br>  I also absolutely refuse to talk to anyone about a Telstra problem when the call is answered in the Phillipines!!! <br>  On one occasion I had my bank phone me at the airport to tell me they had to cancel my credit card because the bank's back up records kept overseas had been stolen ! No, No ,No !!  keep Aussie stuff in Australia  - enough is enough !!!<br>  I refuse to buy American oranges  , grapefruit and Turkish apricots. <br>  I have always bought , Bonds , Berlie, Hush Puppies, King Gee, etc in the past but if the these well know Aussie  icons are going to become Chinese  and the money is helping a Chinese economy  that is already doing better than most  , then I will stop buying them. It is bad enough that our Vegemite and Rosella tomato sauce and Arnotts biscuits went o/s . <br>  Surely the government can help . Or  can the company offer the workers  a stake in the business - other companies have been saved that way before I believe . <br>  Aussie Pride|`|5ctT24MEaa	I find the whole idea  another case of corporate ripoff of the consumer <br>  I for one will definately not even give them a second glance.A friend of mine worked for them and only found out yesterday they were very upset as you would be.<br>  <br>  All i have is disgust at Bonds,Holeproof etc.<br>  I wont be buying them even when there in the clearance bin at Big W<br>  due to them going bust<br>  <br>  Just another case of Big Bosses ripping off everyone except themselves and lining their own pockets.|`|aKd0QOECaa	I just hope they cancel those ridiculous ads with Michael Bingle in them!|`|TRIlyQ3uaa	we will not be buying any of these products again.my husband has put his old undies in an envelope to send back....|`|ulMAVki7aa	Ge maybe in the only person who has discovered nearly all of Bonds stuff is made in China already and for years,followed to a lesser degree by Indian sourced garments.<br>  Keep in mind the high profile selebs ??? they use need the easy money to survive (excluding Mrs Murdock) so the workers lose they always have and will.<br>  Name any Aussie iconic company they all have factories outside Beijing or Shanghai.It started years ago.<br>  Walk into Bunnings the only thing made in OZ is most of the Staff.|`|6DJF65kTaa	I will not buy this clothing anymore and everyone should now boycott all these brands forever<br>  <br>  this move is just so the company can pay less wages to the workforce and more money in there pockets. the government should not let this stuff be imported into to oz,|`|shhZAn1Kaa	yes for sure i'l stop buying coz it aint gonna help here, but overseas.|`|0ade68161b176635a7ac471a737cb578aa	If they move overseas than there is no way I am buying. Not only because I believe in workers rights, but also because the world is meltdown. Instead of these companies staying here and helping the country that made them a globel name. They just want pack up and leave how Unaustralian of them.|`|CQFRE2Kuaa	Yes, we will stop buying these brands..<br>  We all know what sort of quality they will be like with these offshore manufacturers!..instead of lasting, and lastings they will probably fall apart after the first wash!...No point in blaming the govt for the sell off, its the Australian company that sold it overseas..no one twistered their arm, they could of said, "NO" but they didn't..Lets hope not too many more company's are going to sell to overseas companies..KEEP IT IN AUSTRALIA, WE WANT AUSTRALIAN MADE CLOTHING ETC.!!!..Total shame on this company for "selling out". We wish the employee's all the best for their future and hope they get other jobs quickly.|`|AA10899385	Is that because so many of our great iconic brands like Vegemite for example are still made by Aussie companies. Oh, oops no they arent'!<br>  We have been slowly being sold down the river for years, and people still dont seem to notice.<br>  I always try to buy Aussie but it is getting harder and harder especially with countries like America seeming to own us, remember the ugg boot everybody?? <br>  So in answer I will try to remain loyal but it is pretty difficult when all of our iconic brands have sold us out first. Did they ever think of floating the companies so that Australians could buy shares and keep the ownership etc here instead of O/S<br>  Surely there were better options available, damn shame I say|`|v1MXaa8haa	To be honest I love bonds that is all I wear when it concerns underwear and singlets just to name a few. I was very upset when I heard the news on "Sky news" and I would like to say NO  to your question, but ....listening to the CEO of Pacific Brands last night in "Lateline business on the ABC" commenting on the dwindling of the Australian Manufacturing sector, would I have a choice of buying "made in australia" labels???? or is that a thing of the past? It is so sad.|`|Z6YIcSGIaa	Yes<br>  Why buy them when generic are a lot cheaper and as they are now 'made in china' they are no longer iconic.<br>  Would consider buying them if the price reflects the generic product, but not the inflated (Australian) price after using cheaper labour.|`|aEPMG7cdaa	?Where are people getting Aussie made Bonds stuff from??<br>  I havent been able to find Bonds made in Australia for years. <br>  Except a very small amount of the baby/kids stuff everything else says 'Designed in Australia, made in China' all the mens and womens knickers, tshirts, hoodies etc is already made in China. <br>  <br>  Do people not read the labels or is there some source I dont know about??|`|S37C2foxaa	but what else can i buy? can you tell me what other brands are still made in Australia??? I cant think of any!|`|OmSZAsTUaa	Yes.  The Federal Government should introduce penalities to businesses that take jobs out of Australia as in the long run the cost to support the unemployed and the poorer quality goods produced over seas cost the general public in Australia greatly.|`|OcylgYUyaa	Well I know it won't bother Johnny Howard either way I think he'll be living on his ranch he bought next door to george bush's place.<br>  He'll still have that cute little brown nose every one grew to love so much........I hope he know the difference between george and a buffalo or he'll be in big trouble.<br>  Isn't it a shame the ex politicians can't be held financially responsible for the damage they've done to our country.<br>  Will anyone be brave enough to bring back industry and agriculture ?<br>  We sure as hell need it or the grandkids won't have anyjobs at all.|`|I4IXG8Jmaa	Never again.No way known will I support their greedy get rich scheme. I hope they go broke and lose the lot. But they wont because the poor asians working in their sweatshops like animals for 50 cents an hour will make them filthy rich. How convenient to call on the Government when their in trouble and have the tax payer foot the bill for their mis-management. When it suits them. Wonder what sort of a bonus the ***** CEO will get this Christmas. Disgusted  and appalled they call themselves Australian.|`|wJfudIljaa	no i will not bay from this company again it is terrible to our economy|`|kH7KYR2qaa	No.<br>  We have been making and buying Australian made clothing for many years because of there high quality and are made right here in Australia by Australians. Lets keep Bonds,Can't Tear Em & King Gee made here, When Pacific Fabrics move it all overseas they will never be made the same..................CHESTY BONDS not CHESTY WONGS|`|1rBazBXraa	YES|`|0LJIOTXhaa	you bet if we do not support aussie jobs we wont have plain and simple,and thats a scary outcome for all|`|AA12247803	I don't buy Chinese products. They may be made in sweatshops, and if not, the money is still going to a country whose government is guilty of many human rights violations. Also, there is a lot of embodied energy in products made overseas. I would rather buy locally when possible to avoid using more petrol than necessary and polluting the earth further. My partner commissions an Australian lady to make his underwear for him. <br>  <br>  I am considering protesting Japanese whaling in 'protected' Antarctic reserves (as observed by activists on the ship Steve Irwin) by boycotting Japanese products. It is not easy or cheap to be an ethical consumer, but it sure does feel good! I think it would have been wise if Prime Minister Rudd had recommended that Australians use their economic stimulus cash bonuses to buy Australian products. Buying imports has that inconvenient side effect of exporting money.|`|gRCpJ82aaa	In the beginning I probably would have still bought these products. However, I have just read that some of the executives etc in Pac Brands have given themselves a 170% pay rise. One executive went from earning 670,000 to 1.2 million a year! All this after they move production offshore to save money. What a joke I will be avoiding these brands in the future, for sure!|`|E8ociAdWaa	YES|`|9eWMO6vwaa	Yes, both my fiancee and I are going to be looking for the brands that make Australia what it is. It's a horrible thing that has happened, we need all the jobs we can get, and then our two most major brands go overseas. WTF is going on here???|`|4MdGmEAxaa	Yakka & King Gee workwear has been manufactured offshore for many years now. The consumer demands cheap products therefore manufacturers must go offshore as labour rates in Australia are too high.<br>  The consumer always says they will pay for Australian made, but the reality is they dont when they can buy a product that is made offshore cheaper. The Australian consumer is a hypocrit.|`|iooXFpTMaa	bloody oath I will i will refuse to buy them|`|StFaT5J3aa	it all depends whether or not they still want to charge the same amount to buy their products now that they are being made using cheaper labour and sub standard material which wont last as long before it falls apart.All these jobs lost so the company can increase their profit margin, then again they may be related to Kevin Rudd(PM) with the amount of time he spends over there maybe they gave him a little hush, hush money he knew 3 weeks ago about this.|`|i011ALjOaa	Bonds quality had already starting going downhill well before this, t shirts losing shape after 1 wash so to me this was the last straw.What i want to know is what happens to the taxpayer funded cash handouts already given to this company? Do we get a refund? Probably not If they want to go offshore they should have to pay back every cent they've stolen from the aussie public. Screw the rich fatcat directors, make em pay!!|`|rC3ywN2Zaa	I never been a "label" buyer... i buy what suits, fits and is in my budget. I also do look for quality. I do love the holeproof socks tho!<br>  Im sure tho that now that they are made in china the quality of product will plummet.... so i will have second thoughts on the quality next time i buy.<br>  <br>  Its so hard to find any clothing thats australian made!|`|pIeI0nMqaa	Yes, and I will burn all the Bonds undies I've got. ******* foreigners who don't make our country great.|`|AA11800870	There doesn't seem much point, really.  I'd buy Australian if you could name a local manufacturer ... the world seems to be supplied from China's appallingly poor-quality sweatshops.<br>  <br>  We can thank Gough Whitlam for removing tariffs for our footwear and textile industries, which started the downfall our local industries.<br>  <br>  Now the Rudd government is doing nothing to stop the closures and spending $42billion for people to buy imported goods will do more harm than good.|`|X3iaoiYVaa	Yes Yes Yes|`|MoKiMk06aa	I will no longer buy Bonds or King Gee now that Pacific Brands has decided that keeping it Australian is no longer important. They don't care that they have now made so many people jobless - it's cheaper to manufacture in China!  All they care about is the bottom line!|`|L1riKbz8aa	NO|`|BIuSEydzaa	No. We have lost yet another Australian icon to the Asians, who, by the way, do not know Australian sizes, nor do they make strong clothes. I do not believe in sending my money overseas just to receive rubbish.|`|6bff45b007f95fdd76361427871b5a51aa	I liked Bonds because it was sensibly priced, well-made and employed Australians. The decision to give themselves raises and move jobs offshore means profits are the new priority - the clothes will be dearer and poorly made (like other brands.) Expect an advertising blitz later in the year. I'm going to look for aussie-made alternates but well, there isn't any, is there?|`|OE255jfEaa	No|`|dOvpb6WUaa	No.<br>  Like ALL apparel manufacturers, Bonds , Holeproof and other Pacific Brands labels have been sourcing from a combination of Asia and Australia for years, while maintaining their quality control and performance. I'd much rather keep supporting their products, knowing that at least the profits are staying in Aus and being used to support other Australian brands like Tontine, Sleepmaker, Malvern Star etc rather than support a foreign owned label like Speedo or someone else.|`|EvdnRcHRaa	I think that it is about time to dump out of this "free" trade rubbish.If you want to manufacture offshore thats fine but it gets a 200% duty on the way into the country.Then lets see how quick our own manufacturing base is back up and running, not just for clothes but on all items cars, food , While we are about it we should also limit the large overseas companys taking all there profit overseas, such as insurance, banks and so on|`|ssJpI9vjaa	Yes!  How convenient!  Using the current economic climate as an excuse to move off shore to make more profits, claiming among other things that they 'have a responsibility to their shareholders'.  <br>  The part that really annoys me is that they're not the least bit interested in what we think.<br>  I'll be checking labels carefully from now on.|`|Qp0wB4FAaa	Yes|`|eaqmPVtAaa	Most of those products weren't australian made anymore anyway. We are a work wear retailer, who sold "King Gee", but the labels inside their garments all say 'Made in fiji" or "Made in China". This has been the case for over 10 years now. I'd assume the jobs being made redundant are probably clerical, or in distribution.|`|KzRXGwXJaa	yes definitely we cant keep giving these companies our money then they walk out as soon as the going gets a little tough|`|aMTMv6gxaa	yes absolutely!  we try and do the right thing and buy Australian, but it's getting harder and harder...what's left that is truly Aussie?<br>  <br>  in my experience, goods made overseas are inferior yet we still get charged the same price as before.|`|Q5JZ5yuraa	Yes what a joke :( Too many greedy people in this world. Had they advertised a little more heavily that their clothes were made in Australia as opposed to China then they would sell more. Now they will sell a little less I think..<br>  <br>  Though I must say that I thought Bonds stopped a while ago actually making their clothes here. I believe the label says "designed in Australia, made in China"|`|EvfBJKHyaa	If we stopped buying everything that was not Australian made we would be walking, barefoot in our birthday suite and starving.<br>  <br>  The Government could not care less as long as they make there big bucks and there Super Fund is not failing like the rest of us.|`|f4aKvRgTaa	Everyone seems to be rubbishing the head execs of Bonds with regards to this decision.<br>  I own a business in Australia and we definitely don't line our own pockets! With the economic situation at the moment, many of our customers are buying offshore as it is cheaper than buying product made here. I blame the lousy Australian government for this and particularly the abolishing of the work-choice agreement. Our government does nothing to help out businesses in Australia and instead prefer to focus on unemployed people, people on pensions and government associates. Businesses in Australia get taxed ridiculously high, and make it virtually unachievable to make a successful business in this country. I don't blame these businesses for making the decision to go offshore. I blame the Labor government and their ability to make decisions. Just wait...we will have more and more companies going offshore and the unemployment rate here will skyrocket. The government will need to pull their finger out and make some serious decisions here. In the meantime, I would just buy whatever looks good and is the cheapest now, as it is all made in China anyway.<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  Christopher I noticed you mentioned about people telling the government that we should not trade with them etc... the problem is that they are bastardising our industry with cheap prices we cannot compete with. I don't think that the answer is to cut off trading with them. I think the answer is that either Australian businesses need to be taxed less, or we need to start placing higher taxes on Asian imports.|`|hPK96VtOaa	NO|`|9tEAc6QAaa	YES, YES, YES, YES. The big companies maximise profits, the CEO's earn big fat cheques, and the real people, the workers suffer. C'mon Australia give these companies the flick as they flick the Aussies.<br>  <br>  Sambo|`|b9a2c54c58c98579c25fbbe665998bf2aa	Wake up and look at the tags  !!!<br>  <br>  King Gee has not been made in Australia for years and neither is Yakka !!<br>  <br>  I am in the industry and was actually amazed Pac Brands still made so much in Australia.<br>  <br>  Yahoo should do some research before posing inaccurate questions like this|`|BFdRokNMaa	You people. You all jump on the wagon. For goodness sake, were do you think most brands of clothing are made. what about yr addidas and puma runners, were do you think they are made..stop buying them then...as if all of you only buy aussie made articles !|`|pvk9Jkkeaa	NO|`|pJ9HorZ2aa	I will stop buying Bonds now for sure. Am very happy that my children are growing up and I no longer need the wondersuit as they were great for babies. Was happy to spend more for the quality and to support local companies buying a lot of Bonds and King Gee products. Am feeling very sad for the workers too..|`|QAs4LSEFaa	If they are not made here then I will not buy these brands. I am sick of our icon brands going offshore, Its bad enough being foreign owned but if they are also foreign made then let them go broke. Ask Blundstone Boots how their sales are now that they are made offshore. Aussie Only for me!!|`|MGUDpEkJaa	As someone who had her job outsourced many many times, I have been checking for 'Australian' made  in everything I buy for over 3 years now.  <br>  <br>  The Aussie workers are not TOO expensive - using outsourcing is to my mind equal to using SLAVES!  This is how many past cultures became rich over history - off the backs of poor people.<br>  <br>  Essentially all workers all over the world should receive the same wage for the same job.  <br>  <br>  The current recession is a direct result of the greed of corporations squeezing maximum profits and not considering any other factors in decision making.  Outsourcing is just a further continuation of this greed mentality.  <br>  <br>  I predicted this greed mentality would not be good for out economy in Australia ; 3 years ago. Even I was surprised that I was so quickly and completely  proved correct.  Its a shame my bosses didn't listen.|`|yEtBgjwlaa	Yes|`|d14aff50f72e6d7888ac4fdd286e29aaaa	Yup I'll stop buying. I think it is terrible that the jobs are going overseas, the only Australians benefitting at all are those who are selling the products because even when made in Asia, the prices will not decrease to the public at all, the prices remain the same and only the middle people will see the profits.  I will go a step further besides not buying the product, and not shopping at the stores that will sell the replacements.  I will order on line.  Take my Aussie $$ away completely.  I live in Australia and want Australia products, if I wanted Asian products I would live in Asia.|`|DoesJszPaa	No......The weakening Aussie dollar, which is pushing up the cost of imported raw materials, combined with the high Aussie wages will only push the price of these products to the point where they will no longer be competitive..... with rising unemployment and increased financial stress on many families Aussie pride may not be enough to justify the higher prices...|`|uJs22ipXaa	No I will not!  Firstly, I am certain that Pacific Brands has made more than enough profits from Australian consumers over the years to keep it financially healthy throughout the financial crisis.  Secondly, the only reason the companies owned by Pacific Brands have been so successful is that garments made in Australia have been quality goods which actually fit Australian bodies!  I rarely find a Chinese made garment that actually fits me properly, let alone is well made!   I'm certain the reptilian CEO would pass this off as something that won't happen with the imports she will bring here (whilst she wears her designer clothing).  In the interview she gave on the ABC lastnight she repeatedly avoided questions about the job losses, making disgusting comments along the lines of "the workers who have been let go will now have the opportunity to gain employment in a more contemporaneous industry"!  At what point did the production of quality clothing become outmoded as a career?  Last time I looked we all still wear clothes!  Most of us struggle to buy quality at a reasonable price, and lets face it, the companies she in charge of are not cheap!  Will the prices of these companies be reduced when they reduce their production salaries by aproximately $500 per week per worker?  I think not!<br>  Here's hoping the CEO has the opportunity to find herself a job more in line with her personality, maybe a child work house manager!  It appears to me that Pacific Brands is using a temporary financial problem as a scapegoat in order to move production off shore.  I trust the CEO will have some sleepless nights, hard to accept that she too is a woman.  Is she one of those woman who in order to play with the big boys becomes more cut throat than any man?  Mmm, it appears so to me!  Best of luck to all the sacked (I refuse to say redundant as their skills are not, simply rejected by greed) workers|`|SlzDxt5yaa	Do we have a choice? How many brands still exist that are Australian made or owned? I doubt there would be too many.<br>  While Australians continue to elect weak, gutless politicians who don't seem to want to offend anyone except the Australian tax payer, people are just going to have to wear it.|`|I9WhuWEvaa	Absolutely. I won't be buying these brands. I will choose other labels that are Australian made. Pacific Brands took the easy way out and chose to not ride out the tough times. They are pathetic really and make the economic situation even worse. So why should we support their decision? Thanks for nothing Pacific Brands!|`|1714787b1500bc5c65ffea02a8d53f86aa	I will deffinatly stop. I buy Aus made as it helps our own ecconomy & employment and for it's quality. I will either look for an Aus alternative or whatever generic brand is cheaper. No matter what they say the quality of their clothing will drop.|`|6RGmzQvNaa	it is very disappointing that these will no longer be made here, but as long as the quality doesn't change, i will probably continue to buy them.  we are running out of options of what to buy that is 'made in Australia'|`|crc50RMUaa	Yes, I'll stop.  I'm disgusted with the way they handled it all ... and I'm going to continue searching for Aussie Made products - they might cost a little more, but at least they fit me and they don't look like rubbish after twice in the wash!|`|VJ3KgwMQaa	I have been a buyer of Bonds and King Gee clothing for so long I can't remember (over 50 years).  As a matter of fact, whenever I have gone into a shop to buy my Bonds white and black singlets and underpants and King Gee work clobber, if they do not stock them, I politely tell the staff that I will go to another outlet and get the gear I want there.  I will definately not be buying clothing and associated items from Pacific Brands now that they are shutting up shop an moving to an overseas manufacturer.  I am sure I can find another manufacturer who makes these items in Australia.|`|ebZraYZraa	Disappointed. Not going to be buying Bonds anymore- even though I love the clothes. We're conscientious consumers in my household (2 adults and 3 children) and we used to buy Bonds because it was made in AUS. Now we won't be buying any longer.|`|kX2C0BYAaa	having knowledge that bonds have in fact being having their garments made overseas for many years as they found it cheaper to send the materials there have them made and shipped back than have items made here i think their clothes have been overpriced for years,not saying all are but definately some it is sad but maybe a price reduction on some of their lines might help not everybody can afford $15.00 for a pair of undies|`|IjM6I9Uvaa	I'm certainly no fan of overseas takeovers of Australian companies. I worked for Arnott's for a while and it was very dispiriting to see the difference between American executives and the local workers. <br>  <br>  It would certainly influence my decision.|`|R9VCpFS6aa	Absolutely I have 5 children and have the experience of inferior quality of stitching and finishing off with Chinese made garments I will never buy these brands again|`|hyi7WpIKaa	Yes I would, in the current economic climate I will stand by the brands that are produced by Australians for Australians, wouldn't you????|`|AcUMpGUIaa	No diff.  They are a business before they are an icon.  And I got heaps of Bonds stuff made in China.  Who is responsible to pay for unprofitable icons anyway?|`|UcGP4v9Oaa	Yes, only if the fat Board goes offshore with the clothes.I am sure they could afford the move.GREED IS THE MAIN FACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lIY3KENXaa	I certainly wont buy their products, the move overseas and loss of jobs shows the lack of loyalty to its workers, community and Australian public.|`|pJLJtmZEaa	I won't be buying these brands any more.  If they don't support Australia, why should we support them?  They are just the same as all the rest of them now.  Exploiting the poor workers in Asia!|`|IikmOBIKaa	Blood oath! I've been wearing their singlets, t's and underwear for years, last year when I complained to them about their quality I was sent a generic "concerned" e-mail, but no action or recognition of my complaint. From now on screw pacific brands!|`|kT514dcsaa	No. If you look at the labels on the current clothing you will find it is already being made overseas.|`|88454da86f58bdcd5bfd27087d321b4caa	I f I tried to buy only australian made stuff , i would be naked, hungry and poor, no choice, and they are always 10 times the price, that is why these companies make the decision to go os in the first place.|`|FoFZJpD7aa	absolutely - have been an avid buyer of bonds in the past but will not buy non-Australian made|`|ORTgTwuJaa	Bloody oath you better believe it, Just hope this silly government charges high import tax, if you cant make it here pay the price! Stop these big companies doing this NOW|`|AA11885739	YES, I would  STOP buying these brands<br>  because when these people that own the company in question including all their shareholders transfer manufacturing to third world countries with slave labour conditions, they should also go there <br>  themselfs and live there.|`|Yok6WaLMaa	I would Keep Buying!! Atleast the Brand is still Australian Owned.<br>  Much better to buy from an Australian owned company that manufacturers in China, than an overseas owned company that manufactures in China!|`|T6fU1DdKaa	Actually these are what might be termed 'consumer lead redundancies'. If Australians were consistently prepared to pay the higher prices associated with supporting local manufacturing, we would retain these industries. But we want our $5 undies, $100 microwaves etc.|`|atkYt5mNaa	No I would not buy anything from Pacific brands, remember people, sheridan is also in that group.......<br>  <br>  Why would i buy chinesse rubbish at the same inflated price, <br>  <br>  Shame on you pacific brands|`|Gx19KUsDaa	Yes definitely... they capitalised on the Aussie'ness of the brand and now they abandoning when times get tough.  Closing down is one thing - taking the jobs offshore is entirely different!  Hope they dont try and keep the Aussie identity!|`|ti0Hndpzaa	Bluntstone boots went off shore,their boots went from $76 a pair to $36 a pair and are absolutely rubbish!!!Buy Redbacks which are twice as expensive but are one hundred times better!!!THE HEE,Sunbury.|`|Zdqi3yz7aa	No definately not. I will also not buy my workwear from Blunstones. What we need is a list of who is no longer Aussie and more importantly a list of alternatives.|`|IkfoDA2Caa	OH how disheartening!!!<br>  I loved those brands, especially being Aussie.<br>  <br>  Won't be touching them now.<br>  <br>  Us Aussies wont stand for it!!!|`|jWuZoiA9aa	Um, I think if you all go and LOOK at your underware you WILL find most of them made in CHINA anyway. So really nothing will change about them.<br>  Really, have a look. Go on!|`|3860ce6e95891a137e6c5ab6e51446cfaa	Depends if the quality is the same. If it's crap quality then definately not. I really liked to quality of bonds clothing it was really well made and good cotten.|`|efa3dc1ffb1de81dc44980667f87d3cdaa	I will continue to buy if the quality is good. Currently I buy many products from overseas which could be produced in Australia but the combination of high overheads and high wages in Australia means we are not competitive.|`|Txbg742caa	Yes because even if they are being made overseas using very cheap labour they will not be any cheaper when they hit the shops here, we will probably have to pay the postage|`|3pNuYnsCaa	I loved bonds but I will choose an Australian made product over an imported product any day and I will sadly be buying my family different undies from now on.|`|hGOf4Heeaa	Yes l will stop buying them, before we no it the directions will be in a foreign language,|`|146f8674afa84fbec15cdab6f4e6c8ebaa	Well I am sitting here reading this question in my King Gee Work Shirt and I just looked at the label and it already says "Made In China" and I bought this shirt and 4 other King Gee ones about 1 year ago.|`|oXEhf5VUaa	My employers boot supplier did the same thing and moved its operations off shore, the quality of the boots went down and the price went up. You can bet the same thing will happen with these brands.|`|ILrS1FM9aa	Certainly. They're foreigner brands now, I only buy Australian made products.|`|zmfeJEyVaa	Yes I will, and I suggest that they stop using Australian personalities to model their goods, rather, they should use Chinese models to indicate where their goods are now to be made.|`|ded03fa64148a13fbf779db61ffb0c60aa	the bonds jocks i have say made in china anyway, so i dont understand this anyway.|`|k1gTk64zaa	Really depends on whether the quality remains the same|`|C3Y49jAMaa	Definiately will we NO WAY buy these products now that they are being manufactured overseas,<br>  <br>  Really good excuse, and if things become right again do you think they will come back into Australia .... I THINK NOT.|`|3IVsGL63aa	Yes. They are sell outs and blaming the credit crunch for the sacking of a lot of good people at least in my opinion. Going off shore to Asia for cheap labour is nothing new and is rubbish.|`|72V5VHNmaa	Yes definitely! The reason why i bought these products is because they were made in Australia.|`|WEBg30hBaa	YesI  will not buy them anymore.  It is disgusting that all these companies are not keeping their manufacturing here.|`|1d436e304575b51163146ce91f829d08aa	I will definately be reconsidering buying from these brands now that they won't be in australia. Australia always sells itself short!!!!|`|yG8kn98Caa	i won't be buying any of those brands ever again.  they are taking it offshore all for profits, well, they wont be getting any of my money.|`|gOM95QMmaa	For sure if they are going to get this stuff made in China which is likely then I might as well buy the cheap stuff from there|`|hh8GsI2Daa	Oh yeh. thats a load of BS sacking 1800 workers and moving off shore.<br>  They can take their products offshore as well.<br>  I will never by any thing from this company ever again.<br>  <br>  Stick it where the sun don't shine Bonds|`|PdoVAT6caa	Not if they are made as well as they were before.|`|NABqX3XQaa	10 years ago i used to wear king gee workwear but they had quality problems then as they were then made in Fiji - a made in china label will at least improve the quality from here|`|s2Iwx4cAaa	You may want to check your labels first, they have in fact been made offshore for years!!!|`|kwyFwX1Aaa	I cannot blame companies that are struggling with the Australian workplace (payroll tax, unions, unfair dismissal, red-tape, etc) going offshore. So, yes, I'd still buy the brand.|`|pO8kQKgVaa	NO|`|mis0Haxkaa	Yes as a former employee of King Gee I feel very sad about this. I do believe that share market pressures play a part in these decisions.|`|UPVdj0RDaa	Well. yes, I try to buy Australian when I can, but obviously this does not always secure Australian jobs and business.<br>  But people want cheap prices, this takes cheap labour, so this is the consequence.|`|8xmD5s7laa	Yes i don't believe they are sending it over seas that's the way pay some third world worker 50c an hour to make products that belong to us. That sucks big time.|`|280Jp4Z3aa	I bought baby bonds singlets for my son a year ago, and at the back it says 'made in China from imported Australian fabrics'...what the??? i think they have been made in china for a long time now..just now its surfaced|`|IXUXgjppaa	No i won't out of principal. I think these companies are selfish and greedy for doing this at a time like this when the world crisis is so bad and people need their jobs. I will buy anything but these brands.|`|1DuJVNLjaa	Definitely no,why would i give people from other country jobs so those company like this can get away with firing australian and still want our money|`|9bnRBdb0aa	I will change brands. If this manufacturer wishes to desert Australia then I desert buying their products.|`|NVrzC9YMaa	i will stop buying bonds because i made a point to go to wenty to purchase t shirts 5 at atime  undies and bras10 no more will i support this company i live  about 20 miles away but i wanted to support aussie industry|`|RvbZYXCvaa	Yes, once the product becomes overseas made.  While product still "Made in Australia" I will continue buying it only.|`|AA10995951	My mum checked my brothers Bonds, and it said Made in China. His are from target. I think Target has been importing them from China for a while.|`|OTppCcn3aa	they have been off shore for ages so havent purchased for  ages.I do think the defence force should look at their contracts though - our army should be able to wear a uniform that made in the country they defend|`|LXZsF68waa	If it was only BONDS and KINNG GEE yes probably but unfortunately from A to Z  is now from CHINA,  we have no choice than buying them.|`|kcx1zUIPaa	If I stopped buying non-Australian made clothes, I'd be naked.|`|O7OaGVItaa	No! Australian Unions have priced us out of the market. I am surprised others aren't going overseas.|`|NnudsY5kaa	i have clothing by three of the four mentioned. all garments are at least 2 years old. have a guess wher they were all made, certainly wasnt aussy made.|`|0d93dc65f60115b6b64923a29db961c5aa	If I can find an Australian Made, Australian Owned alternative that is what I will be buying - even if it is double the price.  If not, then looks like I will be giving up on undies!!!|`|qHRnD28faa	Will not buy if made in China.<br>  It seems everything these days is.<br>  Nothing will be made in Australia at this rate|`|HrgdYPHYaa	yes. Like someone else said, may as well buy the generic overseas made stuff that's cheaper if it's not made locally. Seems like a convenient excuse to go offshore to me.|`|qZ4vlSORaa	Is there any choice? Nearly everything is made in China anyway.|`|1xcU7U4waa	I will no longer buy these brands once they are made offshore.|`|QwsiHyu5aa	My question is, that now they are going off-shore to reduce manufacturing costs, will the retail price reduce to reflect this SIGNIFICANT reduction in manufacturing? Doubt it!|`|3PkH1e8aaa	I have only ever bought Bonds undies and singlets. If they are going to be made in China I wont be buying them again. Chinese made quality (or lack thereof) is pure crap. Chinese baby formula anyone?|`|jkyOpA0paa	Absolutely, I will now search labels to make sure the garment is Australian made|`|f291b4e182dd40a1611494194b566c6aaa	no l wont be buying them anymore either , so much for keeping australian in australia|`|MtzxC6T2aa	Never again.|`|9a3EzdsGaa	yes, The reason we even bought them was cause they were Australian made. They want to go overseas, so now i have no reason to shop for there clothing...|`|CM9Xhgbiaa	oh yes, I will  definitly stop buying anything bonds,holeproof etc|`|4fv07ridaa	yes.. we should also stop buying or using any service  were any aust comp takes the manufacturing to china,or overseas,, hurt them in bank  same as they have done to aust workers|`|28FWMrpRaa	This really sux is nothing going to be proudly Australian made my thoughts to all the affected staff|`|7HVsmLbvaa	All my clothes come from Op shops. They have very cheap underwear. Mostly with no holes. False teeth from funeral directors very cheap.|`|NhA2XlAjaa	As long as they are good value, doesn't matter if they are made offshore. If we want to keep jobs here, then we should start to be competitive. No one owes us a living.|`|En4UhWmmaa	yes because thats typical of big companys going overseas making money than worry about jobs.|`|9SaHRG1Raa	I won't buy them anymore as I can't afford to support anymore overpaid executives!|`|PeLEZ7l8aa	yes. enough is enough no loyalty no more buy aussie .|`|AA11232083	Why would you decide not to support an Australian company because they cant afford to pay staff|`|5TlI3YBRaa	DEFINATELY|`|QLDpbN6Gaa	No, not after the CEO got $1000 bonus pay rise for every person that Sue Morphett sacked.|`|jIJ4hTOIaa	No.  A walk through Woolworth's and K Mart this morning showed that already most of Bonds men's underwear already comes from China.|`|LhSwRBTlaa	Absolutely not|`|QJ67t6UBaa	will no longer buy|`|Epc8xuSnaa	definitely won't be buying these brand names again usually bought all 3 it's time something was done about all these companies selling out to overseas its hard enough now to buy something made in australia|`|DU2dDPzBaa	No I will not buy if these labels are made offshore.|`|IPMAitSmaa	I could never afford them anyway.|`|1aSMT2GYaa	No, I'll still buy them. I'll buy them even more if they are made in China.|`|hd0XS2r3aa	King Gee hasn't been made in Australia for years .|`|PBrDYFNwaa	I already buy Australian when I can but it is becoming more difficult all the time to find any thing made in Australia.  This is why Rudd's first package had little effect, all the money spent went out of the country to support overseas manufacturers not Australian ones.  And Rudd's next big give away will go the same way, out of Australia. Bonds & King Gee are right off my shoping list for good.|`|4dpHN0XDaa	I buy 'Made in Australia' whenever I can. It creeps me out to see vegetables grown in China in the supermarkets. Yes I am Australian and proud of it. Australia provides my living conditions so why shop for <br>  goods from outside.|`|RbmfJX5gaa	Yep. It is disgraceful that Pacific Brands have done this. Bugger the fact that it is cheaper to make undies in china, Australians are hard workers who need these jobs.<br>  <br>  I will be avoiding PB products.|`|YK1JuIlWaa	it's a good thing they are going, they are deeply in debt and are given 10 million dollars in support each year from the govt, we could do without that, there will always be another brand just as good, we could put the 10 million into finding these people jobs|`|LClopaGtaa	Most definitely, they will be crap.|`|VTZpfTcaaa	I WILL NOT CHANGE.<br>  <br>   i buy for comfort and quality and as some ppl have pointed out most bonds clothing is designed in Oz but made overseas.<br>  <br>  I also agree that if i only brought Oz made clothing i to would be naked as some of it isnt even worth the money i pay for them.|`|mIlWfcOVaa	no|`|UETAqR8Taa	most of the clothes you buy are already from overseas. if it doesnt state origin clearly look on washing instruction label they usually hide it there.<br>  <br>  The tarrifs have to be lifted so australian manufactuers can compete with their prices. <br>  <br>  I'll say some happy news for those who wont buy, many mistakes are made when manufacturing OS because the manufacturer is not on the spot only an agent. It can cost them millions in errors a big brand like that|`|faHLkd7maa	Yes - I will actively seek to buy clothes that are Australian made.<br>  <br>  Remember, the jobs have been sent off shore only because the workers will accept .50c a day and a bowl of rice; or very similar conditions.|`|dBj7dLSraa	As others have already said, Bonds have been made in China for quite some time now.  I used to buy everything in Bonds for my husband, but gave up because of the poor quality - especially the underpants, the waist elastic only lasts a few machine washes.  Not good enough. <br>  <br>  Quite honestly, I would rather pay high prices for Australian-made products that last a decent length of time than go for cheap Asian-made and have to keep replacing. Going for lower prices is false economy in the long run.|`|AA11586960	Yes when it comes to spending my money i prefer to buy Australian made <br>  <br>  and any manufacturer or country that has a bad record i don't buy.<br>  <br>   i don't Buy anything Swiss because they were  supposed to be Neutral country stole from the Jews in WW2and supported the Nazis and Nestle have used cheap Child labour in the manufacture of their products<br>  <br>  and I don't Support the NZ economy|`|DlAOGBz5aa	Most definately! We have to support our workers here, so what brands are available to us here now, Australian of course!|`|KDFHrLluaa	if they change their sizing i will stop buying them. bonds underwear are the only ones that have my size right! however i'm tempted to just stop buying because they aren't aussie anymore, we will see how it goes.|`|L1Tu56TFaa	I would... if I bought those brands, but I don't buy Bonds or King Gee.|`|C3z5O6MEaa	I've had it with selling Australia out.. they can get stuffed|`|dUpVqoB6aa	I think it is very sad that we are loosing our good and trusted brands just because it is cheaper to produce them offshore.It is simple if they can pay someone 5 cents offshore then they do not care about the people here.I have nothing against the Chinese people but I am not sure whether I would be able to have the same trust in the brand anymore.Who knows what materials they would use?I think that it is disgusting that these companies are willing to let our people go and become jobless and depressed just to save money.Some offshore companies use cheap labor and young children to make products.|`|0f5d04e62f3e98fa3f80625e9fe9c6a0aa	Yes I can't stand the fact that another clothing store (or Australian comany) has been sold to overseas. I will be looking for Australian brands today actually as I support Austrlian made as much as possible.<br>  <br>  I used to like the surfing brand Red Chilli till they went over seas so i was mainly a Bonds Girl... now im a free agent as such LOL|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	I love Bonds stuff - especially the kids range. The quality is great and most importantly, they are Australian made. I didn't mind spending slighly more for Bonds products, but I will definitely boycott when they move manufacturing off shore. And I'm not happy about it :(|`|3PhAKM0aaa	Yes.|`|ff089db807fb70de1dd4b7a3f911b9d3aa	That's it, I will be making my own undies and bras. Err.. except I don't know how! Pacific Brands have proven themselves to be a bunch of cheap sell-outs, I'm disappointed but not entirely surprised. Are there any true blue quality Australian manufacturers left? :/|`|2bf1d1282aa8b77b960659293063c0ffaa	Yep, will probably stop buying them once they are no longer made in Australia.  When companies like this move their manufacturing operations offshore, you usually end up getting an inferior quality product.<br>  <br>  Aside from quality issues, the relevant brands will lose the benefit of supporting Australia.  Not only that but the products are most likely to be made in some dodgy factory in some Asian country which has terrible standards for its workers.|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	The problem is that all their competitors are made in china, india or fiji as well.  I will just buy the product that is the best value and will be reluctant to pay a slight premium for these brands in future.  Although I do like the fit of holeproof undies so might continue to buy them if the design does not change.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Yes, but not yet.<br>  <br>  After all the clothes on the racks now are still Australian made... and until the nice 'made in china' (or wherever) clothes are put on the shelves, I will keep buying them. After all, they are aussie made (better quality), good to buy for our ecomony etc. There's no point boycotting just yet. also, I'm assuming that the store I've bought them from has already paid them anyways.|`|KNXprBi2aa	With the known deadly and health risk chemicals that some of our international traders use in their products, and the very strict guidelines that the Australian markets have to stick by - I already only buy Totally Australian products.|`|3nw0XbZwaa	No way!! They were great quality, but wont be for much longer now.. We need to support our country and its workers.|`|XkFdWdQmaa	I will not be buying any of their products that are not made in Australia , I try to buy all locally made or grown, It is very hard at times even when you think you are buying Australian the label tells you that its made from local and imported products, you can never find locally grown rice in the shops because its exported and we get the imported rice crazy is it?|`|FyPKXjEFaa	Yes definitely. What makes them stand apart from any other label in the store now? I may as well buy the generic brand as it's cheaper and probably made in the same conditions are the Bonds/Berlei underwear will be made in.|`|AA11715700	I would love to say that I would not buy those brands but what would be the use.  Everything is made in China now so why single them out.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Definitely.|`|f8KFSKqAaa	I'll definitely be buying other than a pacific brand, i was a big bonds buyer as it was all my three kids would wear, this included bonds socks, knickers and jocks, i used to be a big berlei buyer, no longer though, what would be the point, it will most likely now come out of factory that makes other brands, so it might as well save myself a few dollars and buy the other import, maybe this Sue who had got a 200% pay rise will have to take a pay cut when the profits of pacific brands falls, which i'm seriously hoping will be the case!!!!!  Hopefully they will also now lose their contract with the NSW fire agencies which was worth millions a year to them and good on them for making a stand against these redundancies by taking their business elsewhere!!!!|`|XNFvoIGxaa	Yes I will, I'll walk around naked. King gee are crap, perhaps <br>  they will be made better. Hole proof are the worst socks I've ever bought so I wont buy them anyway. As for King gee, I usually buy Yakka anyway. I've never bought based on where they're made, I buy based on tougher wearing. As for Blundstone, I'm a size 13 1/2 shoe. I have two options. I either <br>  buy Blundstone of a badly made shoe like Bata or Yakka which last about a squillionth of the time.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that Pacific brands went around it the right way and yes, some sort of package should be available for the workers. Things are tough all over. They're not the only ones losing jobs in the economic down-turn. The mining industry has lost more jobs since the crash than Pacific Brands does, the difference is the media jumped on the Australia Made idea. What can they jump on for the mines?!?<br>  <br>  If youre gonna stop buying Pacific brands or insist on buying Australian then don't go to Macdonalds or Hungry jacks, or Woolies, or one of those shops like Crazy Clarkes and The Warehouse who mainly sell imported brands and some of them are actually good. Crazy Clarkes is going into recievership so even though it puts an end to that company and their imports. That will stop Aussie kids having a chance at after-school work and thousands will lose their jobs, but hey, you wont be supporting overseas-owned companies so all good. <br>  <br>  Don't support overseas car manufacturers and only buy Aussie made cars, it may diminish our international trade relationships and everyone in the country may live on the street soon but atleast we will be supporting Australian goods. Imports actually help strengthen trade relations.<br>  <br>   If you're willing to buy from neighbours, surely you must realise that somewhere along the line they will buy off you. <br>  <br>  At the moment our mining resources have taken a beating from overseas sales. That's what's causing our crisis. If you send the message to the world that hey, "we dont want your goods," then they're obviously going to return the favour. So to all you people who insist you have to only buy Australian, think about the 10,000 miners you may just have helped put out of work lately because the Japanese have stopped buying Australian minerals.<br>  <br>  If you want to put money back into the economy, buy more Aussie made tobacco products and alcohol since that's where the Government gets the most of it's revenue. <br>  Also buy some American stuff since Wall Street is the economic hub of the world and where the collapse happened.<br>  This in turn may boost the world economy since it's a world-wide recession. To quote the Borg Queen of Star Trek, "You humans think in such 3 dimensional ways"<br>  <br>  You only have to look at your favourite sports team and where their sponsorship lies (another part of Aussie culture) Stop buying those products if they're from overseas, no more sports team. Chances are even their uniform sponsor is foreign.<br>  Macdonalds and Hungry Jacks (Burger King) are both Foreign owned and do great community work. Care-flight is sponsored by companies, some of them foreign owned too. They should be boycotted.<br>  <br>  Then go into the super market and everytime you see a label that says "produced in Australia under licence to XXXXX using local and important ingredients" don't buy them either and even though you may cost thousands of jobs in the Aussie side of the operation, You won't be supporting foreign companies.|`|AA11128798	It makes me sick when these greedy big brand companies do this to their own country!! We are in the brink of a life altering recession that could break so many families and individuals and what do these companies do - try to help our workers - no, take their cheap labor overseas and watch us fall apart even further. - Heartless!!!!!!!!<br>  NO WAY WILL I BUY THESE BRANDS WHICH I NOW LOATHE!!!<br>  It sickens me|`|wr2uiZk7aa	Yes, I'll still buy some to try if quality is good first.|`|DBvjwPTcaa	When I visit Australia I expected Australian label to be made in Australia. I make it a habbit to check before buying. Imagine coming all the way to Australia buy something made in China. Similarly I don't buy China antique that is made in Singapore. Really sad!|`|sGP5d38qaa	Another well loved Australian brand heading off into the sunset to became generic pieces of trash. <br>  <br>  However, whilst Aussie workers continue to demand high paid wages, companies will continue moving away. Obviously they are choosing to head to Asia because of the fact that its cheaper and their workers don't whinge and whine that they are hard done by.|`|0d78403582fb776161f7bfecfda2df86aa	I'll tell you what. We as Australians over price our Made In Australia items and therfore the average guy like me doesnt want to buy brand name materials. I wish to buy the Made in China cheap stuff. Why? Yes the clothes wont last as long but if I buy 15 pairs for the same price as I would buy 5 Bonds Undies they will last me that long cause I wont wear them out as often cause I'll have a choice. And yes I do change my undies everyday. But the thing is that we way over price our items this is the reason that companies in Australia outsource. I lived in Korea for 2 years and in China as well and their brands are just as good as ours. I think we as Australians need to stand up for our companies but also we need to stand up to the big corporate cats who are making a really big dollar from sales. They put the prices so high that it makes buying Australian made almost impossible. A product that travels 10000 kms is cheaper than the one made 20kms from my house why is this. This is Bull something should be done about this.|`|tvG2y0S0aa	Will certainly stop purchasing the products.  Someone has said they are already made in China - how does that work given so many people in Australia were layed off?  <br>  Only problem I have is that I don't know  what brands they make - only know of the ones stated in the original question -   Bonds, King Gee,  Berlie and Holeproof.  Anyone know what other brands?|`|1JrL80Z2aa	YES|`|oXl8zVZmaa	YES But what the management does not realise is that if Australia goes under their pay rises will not be worth the paper it's printed on.<br>  <br>  The demise for this down turn is computers, banks get rid staff and keep computers which cannot think of new ideas like humans.<br>  I wonder what would happen if a solar flare knocked out all the electronics?<br>  Large stores are getting rid of check out staff and expect the  customers to do their own scanning.<br>  Management needs to read Maslow's laws of peoples needs?|`|FFqmACZMaa	NO|`|K85qdy38aa	YEP!|`|j6OswYPoaa	I think everyone should stick to their guns and definitely BOYCOTT them.  I know that they say that we are not competitive and that our wages are too high.. but let's be realistic.. our wages aren't really too high, they just say sh-hit like that to make us believe that $16.00 an hour is too much money.. wonders if they've tried to live on that kind of money and raise a family.. BOYCOTT THEM I SAY.|`|xwhRfp8Xaa	most definately as the only reason for them moving is greed so the heads can recieve their bonuses and to hell with us mere workers. Seems to be the reason the world is in a mess right now and this company just has not learnt the lesson yet so to hell with them.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	yes I will ,think every business that goes off shore should pay a hefty price in import tax to sell it here if it was first made here and is not a new name brand , Australians  built this business and now they want to import it back to us at a bigger profit.I t reminds me of when they bought the name ROYAL ALBERT from england should see what it costs now and it's rubbish|`|48SKEteeaa	No, it won't stop me buying these brands. I am sorry about the folk who have lost jobs but it was just a matter of time sadly. The other thing I can tell you, despite some other answers here, is that everyone else will do the same thing. These brands are strong and people who say they will stop buying because the range is made in China are just plain liars. There is no resistance to Chinese made goods. People are just letting emotion get in the way of common sense and hard reality.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  To the people who say our govt should stop some Chinese imports - if you want the Chinese to buy our mining, our engineering expertise, our steel, our grain, our natural gas, etc you can't say to the Chinese "*uck off we are not buying your textiles."<br>  <br>  ***EDIT FOR stickeetape***<br>  Stickee I agree with what you said in your edit - particularly where you say Aust businesses should be taxed much less. The only problem I have with that idea is the lowly taxed business will not invest the tax savings on expanding their business, or introducing new products that people want to buy, or reducing their prices to make their products affordable, or employing more people. Instead the tax savings will be spent on a top of the range BMW for dear daughter, or a holiday mansion on Fraser Island. That's the part the govt has an issue with.|`|fUjsE0LRaa	probably not, they are great value and are easy to find, im not really one of those people who are all "i support Australia" so longs as it prices stay the same and the quality doesnt drop it's mine, hey thats what we need in this financial crisis isnt it???|`|KjQaxGX0aa	Absolutely who would want to buy items if they are made off shore.  I bought them because I knew we were supporting an Australian product and providing Australians with jobs and a fairly decent wage. So in a nutshell the new workers get paid less, Pacific Brands profits go up and they expect us to pay the same price for something which costs them less to make.  Greed plus complete and utter bastards.|`|XIFLOYVuaa	Only if the prices are dropped.<br>  Was paying around 20 to 25 bucks each for my good material bonds trunk only cuz they were aussie made. But now if they'll make them in china I dont wanna pay more than 5 bucks. else wud shop another brand|`|CLZI0s6Kaa	i used to buy 5 sets of king gee every year. Now i will look for something else made IN australia. i prefer to keep my money in our economy than send it overseas.|`|bjNgMocPaa	Yes, I will stop buying the brands.<br>  And it sucks.<br>  I love Bonds, Dunlop and everything.<br>  Buuut, considering they're not going to be Australian made, why should I buy them?|`|EqfIQMzQaa	Yes as long as the quality remains the same. I personally don't buy any bonds products for myself however I buy them for my teenage daughters as the Bonds name is like a brand to be seen in now days LOL|`|xYgFcEfwaa	its not just brand or to do with country, i think bond have standard of quality , and doesnt matter where they make it will be the same.<br>  i bought CATERPILLAR usa made and yea they tuff shoes, and now they make in china and it was tuff....|`|hxxOIm1Maa	Yes, no more buying of those brands!<br>  But something that always annoyed me is that everything that is Australian made is way too expensive, so people always turn to cheaper brands. Even with food.  Why is that? hmmm... I am going to ask that question to the panel.  :)|`|za9b8cHKaa	I will definitely reconsider buying their products! Basically, they have just put profit ahead of supporting the Australian economy/people. So why should Australians continue to support them?|`|1ccb71eddd0912f1f81b5e66be18155daa	Yes. Pacific Brands just alienated a big percentage of their customers.|`|xGzq2Eueaa	No way. Now i will by stuff from calvin klein and other brands not stuff that will be made someplace other than australia|`|1AOnGYuVaa	Yes i will no longer be buying bonds and king gee, instead i will be buying other australian made clothes.|`|ef84be9e66c739c11f792c4e975ef404aa	I don't care !!!!<br>  I don't wear King Gee because I don't work.<br>  And I don't buy Bonds because I don't wear underwear.|`|TlHwwnmBaa	i've got quite a few bonds & holeproof stuff and my dad has heaps of Kind Gee work wear. I won't be buying these brands any more and neither will my family and friends.|`|bc5LZrsAaa	Yes, Absolutely We need to support Australian jobs.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	You betcha!

Lbulud8raa	This is called the Welfare State, and you can blame FDR's New Deal for introducing it.     Money comes from those who earn, and a disproportionate amount goes to servicing government debt and in welfare.  As a single person, I also have a gripe about family taxation benefits: singles and those with out children are the cash cows of the economy.  In effect we subsidise those who have made the lifestyle choice to have children, and those who are generationally unemployed.    I have no issue at all with those who cannot work and genuinely need assistance.  My beef is with those who are lazy.|`|VEoG1VCsaa	Mark is right.

To address this need, a workshop was designed whose objective was to develop a detailed outline of a model curriculum that would encompass the skills, knowledge, aptitudes, and attitudes deemed essential for economic success in the veterinary profession.

DgLBtjWoaa	"The first step is to determine whether the newspaper is printed on wood pulp or rag linen paper. For the most part, newspapers printed PRIOR to the Custer Massacre in 1876, were printed on rag linen. This type of paper has NO ACID, thus there is no need to have it de-acidified (removal of the acid). Wood pulp paper, however, contains LOTS OF ACID. De-acidifying wood pulp paper is VERY COSTLY, so should only be done on high-value newspapers, or those with great sentimental value. To have an archivist or conservator do the job might cost between $25 and $50 per page of the newspaper. This, for a typical 12-page 20h century newspaper, it would cost between $300 and $700 to have it done right. There is a special aerosol spray for the do-it-yourselfers, but even that method will still cost $10 per page or so to do the job. Thus, even utilizing this method, it will still cost $100 or more per newspaper to de-acidify it. Dont be overly concerned about the acid in wood pulp paper however.    The next step to do is to unfold the newspapers so that the entire front page shows without having to turn the newspaper over to see either the top or bottom half. Store them in this position (opened) as leaving them folded in half for a long time will cause the acid to migrate to the fold line and eventually eat it so that then the newspaper is in two halves. In this condition, there is NO collector value. (Unfolding the newspapers is also good for those printed on rag linen.)    Next, keep all the newspapers away from sunlight and moisture. Direct sunlight on a wood pulp newspaper can turn it yellow in a matter of weeks. Exposure to moisture will cause mold to grow on the newspaper and greatly affect collector value. Although there are special acid-free boxes for storage of newspapers, there is a less-costly method to utilize. First, purchase a bundle of acid-free tissue paper and wrap each newspaper individually. Seal it in a few spots with archival tape. (Do not put the tape on all edges and totally seal it. Leave areas where air CAN get in and out.) Then a flat "ordinary" box can be used for storage. A good rule of thumb is that a box no deeper than 10 inches works best.    An alternate ideal storage box is the kind printers film and paper comes in. Although these boxes are only about three-quarters of an inch deep, these work fine for storage of one or two 20th century newspapers. To find these boxes, check your Yellow Pages under "Printers". Skip the quick printers such as Kinkos, Print-in-a-Minute, etc. Instead, find commercial printers. Start telephoning them. The first question to ask if they can print with 17 by 22-inch metal plates. If the answer is "No", move on to the next printer on the list. Once you find one that does print on metal plates this size, ask them if they have any EMPTY ONES. A large commercial printer will go through 2 or 3 boxes a week. Most will gladly give you the boxes at no charge or a minimal fee -- $1 or so each. Why are these boxes ideal? They have a special lining in them to keep light and moisture out -- the two main enemies of newspaper preservation!    Lastly, store the boxes of newspapers in a dry, heated area -- NOT an unheated garage, basement, attic, outdoor storage shed, etc. Ive found the best place to store them is under a bed."|`|ietcvtiuaa	Vacuum seal it in one of those Space Bag things or the Glad freezer kind.

I7qHLCQqaa	That's so great to see a girl like you thinking about the well being of society, very admirable.   In contemporary american civilization, as you know, politics and the media co-exists and necessarily interact with eachother. Going into politics, if you make an effective difference, will naturally result in connections and opportunity in the media. And im not just talking about positions in politics in the public spotlight like senator or congressman; lobbyist and public advocates that are not public figures find their way into major issues of society.   Also, if you choose a career in politics you will no doubt have to have a degree in law. Most politicians or political-like figures started their careers as attorneys.   On the flip side, journalist, apart from broadcasters and t.v. hosts, rarely find their way into politics. People who write stories or conduct interviews--that's all that they do. They dont make proactive decisions that effect societal nature, which is what politics is all about. However, if you have the charisma for it, a career in journalism can be deeply lucrative.   If you want to hold politicians accountable, sorry to tell you, but that's what the people do. T.V. hosts and journalist do not hold politicians "accountable", they just argue a side or creatively write an opinion. But they do not hold them "accountable". If you want to hold them "accountable", your going to have to be one of them--bottom line.   If your passionate about politics, go for it. And like i said, and like you know, positions in the public sector heavily interact and often predetermine media frenzy.   Those in the public sector also write quite often. Verbal journalism for most people that go into the field results in the written form. If you go into politics, you can and probably will write.   Every t.v. station has a bias. FOX is republican driven and CNN, democratic.   Your best way into politics, as argued before, is via law. Attorney generals, anti-trust lawyers for the department of justice, etc., are all around the political environment, if not, they can be considered politicians themselves, specifically a position such as attorney general.   Are you in college? If not, major in political science, economics, or philosophy to go on to study law. Minor in journalism. Or, vice versa; that is, Major in journalism and minor in political science or economics (and yes, or even philosophy). Get involved with social organizations that promote a cause, that are politically acknowledged.   What do you want to do 'exactally?' Do you want to conduct interviews, host t.v. shows--thats journalism driven. Do you want to be a politician? As argued numerous times, thats law-driven. You will need to be elected, and in order to do that you have to have money. John Edwards made enough money as a lawyer to run for president, and because he was the go-to guy for legal issues, he cought the attention of the public eye. He made ties with people, did favors (legal ones, hopefully), and charmed his way to the top. How do people react when you speak to them, are they star-struck? They need to be if you want to be a politician.   Either way, you seem very focued, which is very, very cool. No doubt you will do just fine.|`|BkdZEvpzaa	those cant hold as politicians become journalists    you are a young girl    lots of time to decide    read R. NIXON's biography then decide...|`|bkav003oaa	I would recommend a career in law. Lawyers rub shoulders with Lawmakers and gain influence and contacts, especially if they work at the District Attorney level. It will also allow you to fight for real change on a legal level, and be busy learning the ins and outs of the political system.     Journalism is a fun career, but there is just as good a chance of you ending up writing copy for SportsCenter as there is you hosting a Sunday news show.     I would go into law, you seem articulate enough to handle it, and then work on a career in politics.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	I think that just by reading that, you'd make a GREAT journalist! =)  you sound passionate about journalism, which is very important, and you also have quiet a way with words  i can almost imagine you speaking when i read what you write  You really are talented sweetie.  And, if I can tell all that just by reading that thing in 2 minutes flat, I can tell that Journalism is the way to go.  With journalism you can be TOTALLy unique with who you are.  You can be critisizing, nice or just someone who says the facts.  But, with politics you have to work much harder to achieve much less, and you don't get to be unique and different.    I recommend Journalism, I think that you'd do GREAT as a Journalist, but remeber that this is your call and you need to make sure that what you pick is what you definatly want to go through with.    Good Luck with this decision!!! =)|`|whE5OQ26aa	Don't do either unless you want to be broke.    Major in something useful, like accounting, engineering, stuff like that. Here's a tip, many of those big-name universities are out to get students to major in their liberal arts programs. You won't get a job doing that.    I'd recommend a law degree, but try to get as many scholarships as you can. If you want to pay for it and stick through it, that's your best shot.    I don't really know what to recommend. There's a lot of people out there with degrees and no jobs. Bachelors, masters and PhD, no joke. Do something that will get you a job, and gives you a skill you can use many places.
10554e42be61cc129e1f63de5ce47d79aa	yes... low ratings... last year in a study, women said that flocked to nbc before cbs for evening news.|`|CDmGlLXCaa	i HATE katie couric.. i hope she is fired and can't find a job and is forced to live on food stamps.|`|BE2vknbHaa	Good. I don't like her.She belongs on Good Morning America. They are so many women anchors who are better at their jobs that could of been pick.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Not if she is still sleeping with the powers that be.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Good! She's horrible in that position. She's so biased even my cats hate her.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	This article was written last April about a meeting in February.     My guess is that Couric probably has bought herself some time, probably because the ratings have gone up. If they were going to do something, I would have bet on something around Jan. 20 (inauguration day).
RzX1c1nxaa	only with a view to make the world to understand the real facts of ethnic problem through them.    if both are not there the facts will be hidden to suit their personal view.
5VWahoKRaa	I watched the Film taken in the Zoo and did not see any proof that the area was booby trapped by Hamas , the Israel soldiers seemed very willing to push their lies that Hamas does not care for the lives of their children . If we recap wnen the conflict was in full swing Israel kept foreigh journalists away from the area ,hoping to hide from the world their criminal, illegal acts.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Do we have any proof that this actually happened? And pictures or anything. I don't always believe what one person says unless there is some kind of proof.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Between this and the global warming "polar bear" story I don't know which one is more touching or would motivate animal-loving children more. I wouldn't put it past Hamas to bomb their own zoo and then try to frame Israel for the destruction. I doubt if Israel had anything to do with it.|`|midmBgJJaa	I'm in favor of Israel but I'm disgusted if this story is true. Could you provide a link ?     Do you have a solution that will 1. reject Islamic terrorism 2. Not result in the mass death or expulsion of Jewish people and 3. Avoid creating another Iran with shariah law on the ashes of Israel?    I do think there is a way for peace if both sides compromise. This madness has to end somewhere.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Myth.    The lions are in Ramat Gan, I saw them get on the plane. I don't know what happened to the monkeys, but there were explosives wired to every cage entrance.    If an Israeli missile had hit the camel, it would be in pieces. Honestly - Arab media is not bound by law to tell the truth, so using Gulf News as a source doesn't do much for you. 'Brother' - if you have never been in the Middle East, you don't understand what Hamas is or what lengths they will go to to demonize Israel. Lucky you, I suppose.    People who are incapable of fighting head-on choose "alternative" means of combat.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	that is absolutely disgusting. zionism = evil|`|uyfFGeMsaa	Yes, Hamas did indeed booby trap the cages, and a neighboring school with explosives.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHhs9ihSm...|`|Uac9AXmDaa	This is going too fair now, if what you are saying is true then please give a link to support your statement. Some one really needs to do something to the system of Israel, because i don't understand how the animals are terrorist.|`|tod8jy9Paa	The problem with Israeli troops is they cant tell the difference between a monkey and a man That's why the shot some of their own troops in the latest conflict.  Their motto is  "If it moves shoot it" That's one reason why 400 children were murdered also  Mr Natural and darkAL Yes they did find a booby trap and defused it so how could that have killed anything ?  Mira Bell here is your link|`|GDwMdfqjaa	Incredible just how far the Palestinian propaganda goes.    Luckily, this time, the lie was proven wrong even before it was made up. Look at this video, from minute 08:00 and beyond you'll see what was the real treatment of the Israeli soldiers towards the animals:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cac_12315...    Also, in this video you can see that the zoo was booby trapped by Hamas:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHhs9ihSm...    One lie proven wrong, unfortunately there's many more to go.    Edit: michael w - The way Israeli soldiers treat the animals in the first video vs. Hamas booby trapping the entire zoo shows who is to blame for any animals killed.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The zoo was booby trapped, Israelis went in the zoo went bang.      Hamass is even killing animals.    This is before hamass killed all the animals.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHhs9ihSm...    Look at the way Palestinauns took care if these poor animals.  This photo made available by the Palestinian Media Watch group, Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2007, shows a frame taken from a Hamas TV show for children in which a man in a bee suit, known as Nahoul, swings a cat by its tail. The Hamas TV show "Tomorrow's Pioneers," depicting Nahoul abusing cats and lions at a Gaza Strip zoo drew a protest Wednesday from the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Intended to warn children against abusing animals, the images are followed by a warning from the show's young host that children should not mimic Nahoul's behaviour. PMW logo applied by Palestinian Media Watch.   http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...    RAFAH, Gaza Strip - The monkeys and lions were drugged, tossed into cloth sacks and dragged through smuggling tunnels under the border between Egypt and the besieged Gaza Strip before ending up in a dusty Gaza zoo.  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...|`|Wl8kWflVaa	Considering how the Palestinians have been taking care of even themselves the past few decades, it might be those animals weren't in very good shape.
4KtPFzz5aa	The prosecution has overwhelming evidence that Casey intentionally killed Caylee & she acted alone.  I do think that Lee, and possibly Cindy & George, are involved in a cover-up.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HUMyfDeF...|`|pevfr6fZaa	Yes I think she did. Either that or she helped the killer. Sick little... Ugh I hate child killers!!|`|r5OtwjS9aa	Of course she did! Xannie was babysitting. (xanax) anti-depressant that makes you drowsy. I cannot believe no one has gone into the mom's medical record yet or, looked through her pill cabinet and made the connection. How stupid are these people? She was searching for chloroform, ways to kill peacefully and low and behold the kid ends up dead and close to home. Go figure.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	absolutely...i think she did it maybe in a fit of rage or by accident then covered it up...but i don't know why she put duct tape on the childs mouth???? it's so sad...it's anthony not anderson...|`|AA10531094	She killed her or knows who did.|`|b7HFB7H6aa	without a shadow of doubt.|`|6ade8f304e48ef25e16f2a4444611313aa	I don't think anyone knows who did it, incuding know it all, always ready to declare someone guilty without all of the evidence, big mouth drama queen, Nancy Graceless  Maybe Caylee's grandpop did it.  Guess no one will ever know until trial ~~ unless someone fesses up.|`|AA12108398	yes.
AA12390275	Who the heck is Ted Haggard.|`|7ac059b087b862ee928a10e4117963fbaa	You really should go ask this in the society and culture -> religion & spirituality section if you want 'bible people' to answer.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Again David. As a Christian, I am a follower of Jesus Christ, not Ted Haggard.
b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	My guess is that they are giving the public a little time to get used to it, as odd as that may sound. It's like when a new Senator goes into office in a particular state. A first reference without a first name sounds a little jarring at the start.|`|ietcvtiuaa	Someone talked about that on a viewer input thing they have on the local news. The reporters there claim they have always used their full name. I really don't know why it seems that way.|`|duECVxVraa	I think the press are being informal towards him because he is an informal kind of guy.and very laid back.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	umm i think that it depends on who is talking, and because it is new they are still using his full name? we all knew who clinton and bush were because they have been around forever so who else could they be talking about you know?|`|023b8a39e479685da4d34522f117a38baa	That is a good question.   I have heard newcasters call him Barack also.  Even after he was president.|`|Evmgd3p2aa	Barack Obama is a cool name!!!!! haha maybe they just like saying it.     (:|`|kJxCIO1Iaa	i was thinking of this the other day too. i do think it is  rather weird.      btw can you e-mail me at shamanfaredhead@yahoo.com I wanted to know more about your hair and stuff. I liked your answer plus i am also 15 =]
Zq7f1wyYaa	Which one?|`|bfjs9wSLaa	He had to make some really hard decisions and he isn't perfect, but he didn't let the press get to him by being so negative.     I actually kinda respect him 4 that.|`|Xx2fMy1Xaa	He stunk!|`|nT31zeQaaa	good and bad     foreign policy great    economy not so much|`|PJH9vHf1aa	What? He had two unresolved wars and the economy in a mess. He has wiretpped everyones phones and disregarded the law in many other ways. Unemployment is twice that when he went in. You tell me how he is a good leader.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Perhaps you should re-visit footage of the Twin Towers crumbling again for your answer. He made lots of mistakes but I and those I love have been safe since 9/11.     It isn't a popularity contest and he stood his ground despite the jokes and hatred.    Good leader
4OLpe1Ylaa	Video tape the creep. I applaud you for loving your little sis. Whatever you do, don't take personal action.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	Tell your parents to talk to the idiots in charge at that school themselves. Then tell them to talk with the boy's parents. Meanwhile you or someone else wait for your sister after school to escort her home until this issue is resolved. That boy wont want to touch her then if he sees an older kid or adult on the scene.|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	I would tell your parents so they can complain to the school and the kid's parents.   In the meantime..............BEAT THE **** OUT OF THE KID!|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Tell your parents!  Beat that little boys *** or cuss him out.  Stupid little immature kids, I swear.  Thats so fked up.|`|mYp3SSxkaa	I don't know who she's reporting to (I'm not sure what you mean by 'Safety'), but your parents/guardian needs to know what's going on if they don't already, and your parents (and you, if you think you'd be an asset) should both go to the vice principal or principal of the school.
UAMtRFruaa	Yes.
hNhANiZeaa	I agree Obama is our savior.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Oh pleeeeeeze! Makes me want to barf.|`|nT31zeQaaa	ya right the saviour cant be black more like the anti christ
960pO2oHaa	BBC News is good and pretty objective. If you live in the U.S., it's still good for world news, as it covers a lot of American issues. ...I'm curious though what others on here have to recommend.     Anyway, here's a link to BBC:    http://news.bbc.co.uk/    Oh! Also, NPR is REAL good too:    http://www.npr.org/|`|tguEmxVyaa	http://jjsolari-vs-you.blogspot.com/|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	That website doesn't exist.........but Fox News.com does!|`|HhPgZDDzaa	I don't even know if there is a website, but try Fox news. They are the "ballsier" news channel/station/website that will take on stories that the other news places won't. You'll be more likely to come across the truth on Fox..|`|JaTjoLNlaa	don't listen to these idiots. there fox news advertisers. fox news is one of the most brainwashing channels on your tv. they lie about everything, and tell everything the govt wants you to hear.   fox news should be shut down for shoving so many lies into the heart of its own country.   a huge example is the russia georgia conflict, when it 1st happened, they said that russia invaded georgia.. witch was completely false.. but you can't hold down such a big lie, so it got out eventually, and made fox look real bad.      im still looking for the same site you are. but i keep myself posted with anti-propaganda people on youtube. look up nufffrespect, he has millions of subscribers cause he gets the truth.|`|AA11598210	~~Watch and/or read MSNBC. Always accurate, give both sides of any argument their time, and dissect little known ("hidden facts"). They are the best news source.    My special favorite is Rachel Maddow!~~
