I'm a beginner rider and i'm a little bit confused about when to shift......i just don't wana blow up the engine or something because i'm using the wrong gear over an extensive period of time.   At what rpm's is good to shift gears? For example, if i'm riding a 2008 kawasaki ninja 250 with 50 mph, in what gear should i be (4th or 5th), what about at 75-80 mph freeway speed? Do i have to look at the rpm's to know when its time to change gears? I tried to listen to the engine's sound to get an idea when its time to shift, but i couldn't distinguish the pitches very well because of the helmet.

I have a 1986 Chevy Suburban truck 2500 and the idle on it is constantly getting stuck on full throttle and I have to punch the gas pedal to bring it back down but then it'll go back up again and stay there until I punch the gas pedal again.   I know the idle is supposed to be high while it's warming up but once it's warmed up isn't it supposed to remain at a normal idle?      I think the choke might be getting stuck and we sprayed carb cleaner into it and that seemed to help for about a week but now it's doing it again.      What could be causing this any ideas?

A buddy of mine suggested the Flowmaster 44 3 chamber series, but I have no idea what it sounds like.  I love the flowmaster 40 series, but it's a bit loud for an everyday driver.

20090305080508AAJWwOX	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car making buzzing noise at 40 mph, only uphill?	I have a 96 honda civic ex with 105,000 miles on it.  When I am driving uphill and hit about 40 I start to hear a buzzing noise.  It sounds like it is coming from in between the driver and passenger seat, under the car, by the dash.  It sounds almost like a cross between mettle rattling and radio static.        It only makes the noise when I am going up hill and 40.  If I am driving on strait road or down hill I never hear the noise.  There is a sweet spot for the noise.  If i release the gas when I hear the noise it goes away and if I punch the gas it goes away.  But if I push the gas it always shifts to the next gear.  So I know the noise is at the top of whatever gear I'm in.      Any help would be appreciated.  I would like to fix it myself, I'm broke.

20090227020325AAgeanE	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	How do I sell a car in Victoria (Australia) to someone in NSW (Australia)?	The potential purchaser lives in Qld, wants to buy my car (advertised online) for his parents in NSW. I am in Victoria.   He is asking can we leave it registered in my name til the rego runs out - then transfer it into their name in NSW.   I am not sure I am comfortable with this as I worry I will be liable for speeding fines, toll fines and accidents should they happen? Is this correct? What suggestions have you got? PLEASE remember this is an AUSTRALIAN question and overseas answers are NOT relevant. Thanks.
20090227020716AAv8o2u	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	My car system needs help!?	Alright i have an old school punch 500. I am using monstor RCA'S ran down the passenger side of my Cobalt to the trunk. I have a 1farad cap as well. My remote wire is hooked up to the power steering fuse, and ran down the center of the car. All power wires are in the trunk. All was working well, then one day i start getting this extreme bass and full excursion from my p3 12...and there wasnt even any music on. Also you can hear the gears shift through the sub, and you can hear the turn signal also. It has gotten to where it won't even play music, it just does its "super excursion" feedback  Is this problem likely because of how I have it remoted? Thanks in advance, and if you have any questions ask, and i'll answer.
