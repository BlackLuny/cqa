I've tried spraying her with water, I've tried saying "no" and putting her on the floor, and a few times i have lost my tempter and smacked her on the bum (not hard) and said no! (i know its wrong to hit animals, and i feel very, very bad for doing it so don't point it out) i have also tried picking her up by the scruff and saying no!       a few times she has bitten and clawed my face! she has bitten my mother and is VERY naughty, i understand that this is normal kitten behavior and she should grow out of it, but i want a solution NOW my family is trying to get rid of her! i love her too much to lose her, although she annoys me a lot

But mainly i feel like i'm neglecting her. I wake up with her until i have to go to school. then she's by herself until 2:20 in the afternoon. when i get home we play with her and give her attention. then sometimes i want to play video games or something so i put her on the floor to play and she will start to cry. and i feel horrible. i don't know if i have started a bad habit by picking her up all the time.    then sometimes i want to go out with my boyfriend or friends and i can't take her. but i feel again like i'm neglecting her by leaving her at home by herself again. am i neglecting her or is it just a puppy thing to cry like that all the time?

I'm moving out and will be on my own in September.  I have been thinking about getting a psychiatric support dog (PSD) to help me while I'm in college because it is difficult for me to do basic things on my own (remember medication, wake up, etc.)  I also get nervous in crowd of strange people and my moods often change throughout the day.  My therapist suggested for me to look into getting a trained PSD but I don't know where to start.  What kinds of dogs are the best for psychiatric support?  What are the requirements to have one?

Do you think any will be runts? She is in a smallish cage about 12" by 5". Could that make her eat the babies because shes in a smallish cage? When should I move them into the bigger cage or let her sister near her and the babies, and when should I handle them..      Also there was a bit of blood around the area were the babies where do you think she ate one or would it just be from giving birth? This is her first little by the way :) Sorry for all the questions haha.

20090310032408AAOaXDP	Pets;Dogs	When is it safe to adopt another puppy after parvo?	I've heard that parvo can live for up to 50 years in the right conditions! I've cleaned the house from top to bottom, bleached anything that could be bleached, threw away my puppy's toys and dishes, and used RXV Parvo Foam on the carpet, furniture, walls, floors, and everything she's touched! Is it safe to adopt another puppy, or will it ever be safe? Will its first set of shots be enough to protect it from parvo? Having my puppy die from parvo is definitely an experience I don't want to relive.

20090310034410AA46iwc	Pets;Cats	Could anyone please help with cat diagnosed with over active thyroid?	My cat was diagnosed with an over active thyroid gland yesterday and has been given 2 weeks of tablets to try before I have to take him back to vets. The vet told me that has has to go back to the vets every three months for the next two years for repeated blood tests and check ups. Is this right? Also, he took blood from my cat's neck, is this safe. I asked him twice to take blood from the leg. I also asked the vet to test my cat's kidneys at the same time with the blood test he took, and he said it would be two seperate blood tests for that - one to check the thyroid and one to check the kidneys.  If anyone could confirm I would be so grateful - Just a bit worried. Thank you so much in advance.
20090310035201AA1wrJF	Pets;Dogs	Everytime I pull on my dogs fur it falls out.  Why?	From time to time (usually mid-morning) I start to slowly stroke my dogs back and hindquarters and eventually it turns more into a tugging at his fur coat.  When that starts to happen, gobs and gobs of fur start falling off in my hand.   Is there something wrong with my dog?  Is this an indication of SIDS (he is 1.5 years old) or diabetes?

20090310051056AA6aUAg	Pets;Dogs	Why would the vet prescribe something that would hurt my dog?	Hills I/d dog food.    Everytime we are in they try to push that dog food.   They know he can't tolerate corn and is allergic so why to the push a cornbased food.      We feed California Naturals Low Fat Chicken and Rice (The vet had not heard of it but I think they get kickbacks from hills.   I'll be honest I'm pretty sure my vets office is more about the money then anything and to be honest most of their clients are well off....except us which is why we are searching for the right vet)      I know vets typically know nothing about nutrition but you think they would know enough not to push a food that could potentially Kill my dog.      Here are the ingredients to Hills I/D       Ingredients      Water, Egg Product, Turkey, Rice, GROUND WHOLE GRAIN CORN, Pork Liver, Soy Fiber, Dicalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Iodized Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Taurine, Thiamine Mononitrate, Copper Sulfate, Manganous Oxide, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Biotin, Riboflavin, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid.          Why would a vet be so reckless?      I mean I don't feel like I can trust them.      We got the food the first time he had a flair up and he had trouble eating it and I double checked the ingredients and sure enough it has corn.    We've refused it ever since.           I mean they are a doctor I know they are vets arent they supposed to do whats best for the dog in treatment?      (my dog has chronic pancreatitis)

20090310045818AA7oJtZ	Pets;Horses	What is a good show name for a QH/Arab named Crook?	I just got a new horse named Crook and I think the people who had him before me just put in Crook as his show name but that's kind of boring so I was wondering if you had any ideas. I would like his name Crook to be in the show name because everyone around here knows who Crook is. He is used for all western games and he is brown in color with a very long mane. He has 1 white sock, a star and a snip as markings. He is around 14.1hh. He is also blind in his right eye and runs barrels in around 15 seconds (which is good for a half blind 14.1hh pony...lol).      I have no pictures of him at this time since I just got him a few days ago.

20090309114702AAaKxOK	Pets;Other - Pets	What pet would you suggest...?	My family of four, including me, my husband, and our two boys (14 and 6) are moving into a three bedroom townhouse. My little one is moderately Autistic, my 14 year old has Asberger's Syndrome (a very high functioning Autism), and I myself am disabled (Stage Four breast cancer survivor, with unrelated mild neurological impairments, including visual impairment and mild motor issues.) Because of our disabilities, we are allowed to have a companion/service animal. I haven't had pets in years, but when I was growing up, I always had one or two cats and a dog. The problem is, I love both cats and dogs and can't decide which would be a better choice for this situation.       I do know I want a spayed female, and either a large front-declawed lapcat (that can run away from my little one if need be) or a small to medium dog that can physically handle being loved on, but not yippie so as not to be annoying.       I want to rescue an animal from a shelter if possible, so I'll probably get a mix breed of sorts, but I don't really know what breeds to even start with.       Obviously, I'm home all the time and will be able to work with the animal as much as needed, and will physically be able to go for short daily walks if I get a dog. During good weather, we have a play area she can run around in, too, but not a fenced in area that is available ALL the time, like in a backyard.       Thank you so much for your time and thoughts. My children and I much appreciate it!!      Blessings

They have seemed to have settled in pretty well and they play a lot and are enjoying themselves.  The male kitten has no problem using the litter tray, however his sister is having some trouble.  She keeps peeing and pooping in the corner of the room!  We are putting her in the tray regularly to show her this is where should be going, but she never settles and always runs off, also when she is about to go, we quickly place her in the tray.  The soiled areas are also cleaned throughly.  I understand it is early days but can anyone give me some advice that i haven't already come across.  There is only one litter tray as the previous owners said that the mum and dad and whole litter were sharing one?  Any advice welcome!  Thanks in advance :)

I'm not sure if the questions will be different because I am going to come up with questions as I go.  I am going to be the first-time owner of any small pets on Saturday (or Sunday)!  I'm getting rats so I want to hear about your experience with rats and certain things about how to take care of them.      Answer as many as you can.  If you don't own any rats or anything but want to answer some of these, feel free.  If you have other small animals you can answer, too, I don't care.  No saying rats are stupid or gross or owning rats is a dumb idea!  Serious answers please.  If you still answer the question but add in funny parts somehow, and that is how you feel about owning rats, I guess that is okay.  Answer the question though, please!      #1: Do you like owning rats?  How often do you regret it, if at all?   #2: Are your rats male or female and how many?   #3: Would you rather have male or female rats?  Why, if you want to explain?   #4: What is something special you have made your rats or something strange/different you have done with your rats?   #5: What do you use for bedding?  Type and/or material?   #6: What do your rats do to make you laugh or smile?  How often?   #7: What cage do you own?  Links would be helpful unless hand made.   #8: Do you miss your rats when you are gone?      Sorry there's so many, you don't have to answer them all.  Answer as many as you can though.
20090309153640AAVAcWC	Pets;Rodents	Are my gerbils eating their food?!?	Hiiii! I recently trained my gerbils on Mazuri Lab Blocks which I heard are healthier. Don't say they're bland and boring because there are vegetables, fruits, seeds, etc. all mixed into one pellet. Appearance doesn't mean everything :D Anyway, I never see my quite fat gerbil, Oreo eat it, but I have seen my other gerbil, Cloud eat it. When I do see Cloud eating it, there's usually a pile of dust from the lab block under him. Do you think he's just possibly chewing on the block and letting all the food fall to the floor of the tank in a heap of dust???? Do you think my other gerbil is even eating any of it? Should I just change back to a Seed Mix? Do you recommend any type of seed mix that is fairly healthy for them? Sometimes I give my gerbils a tiny handful of my hamster's seed mix just incase they aren't eating lab blocks. I don't want my gerbils to starve to death. Can you answer these questions. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH!??!?! Ok....sorry....THANKYOU!!

20090225085247AAW2vcJ	Pets;Dogs	What can i do for my poor puppy?	my puppy started training a couple days ago. when we where introducing the other dogs my puppy just wanted to jump on all the other puppies. so the puppies barked at him to tell him not to. i don't think he even understands what they are telling him. The trainer said if he doesn't learn not to jump on other dogs hes gonna get bit. I've been socializing him our vet and our training is at pet smart. so when ever he gos to the vet or pet smart we let him walk around and visit with the other puppies. he also gos to a doggy day camp twice a week. to play with other puppies and dogs.They say hes not doing good with the other dogs. He doesn't fight with them he just starts jumping on them plus I have another dog at home as well. what can i do so he doesn't get bit when hes older how can i teach him the nose to butt thing?  hes 11 weeks old and hes Malamute so hes gonna get big

He is only alone about 4 hours out of the day. I was just wondering if you think dogs get lonely? Do you think having one dog at a time is good, or would you have 2 dogs at a time so they can play and have each other for "company"? If you have one trained dog, do you think that dog kind of "helps" with training if you get another puppy?

20090309125847AAgzBrZ	Pets;Dogs	My newly adopted dog is not following me.?	i just adopted a chihuahua mixed with terrier female dog for about 5 days. today, i took her out without the leash to see how she reacts. to my surprise, she ran wild! she ran across the street even though she heard me calling her, and turned her head and looked at me. then she ignored me, and just crossed the street by herself!      is it normal? i have sort of had several dogs before which are not leashed, and kept by my neighbors, landlords. once they see me, they always follow me.      when i lock this dog in the bathroom, so i can have some my own time, she will whines for about 8 mins or so. and at night time, when i watch tv, she always try to sleep on my lap even when i push her away. i thought that she is too clingy.      so i don't know why she is not following me when i go outside? she is about over 1 year old. my neighbor also has a chihuahua, just the other day, i saw the dog ran away, the owner was screaming as well. is it the same thing for chihuahuas?
20090225085436AAhtZnA	Pets;Horses	Is this something that a horse owner might be interested in?	I have a coming 4 year old paint mare that I am breaking and she is super lonely and kinda of depressed seeming. Our neighbor had horses at one time last summer but had to sell them and one was her buddy, since then all she does is mozey around and lay down.    I am looking for a broke horse that I can ride on the side maybe in local gymkhanas etc that would also be her buddy and maybe help me teach her some new things.    We cannot afford to buy a horse right now, so I was brainstorming and I want to know if this is something that people might be interested in doing. I have about a 2 acre pasture that she is in and I was thinking that someone could board their horse for free at my place (providing food and farrier etc still) but not have to pay monthly board, and I would feed, clean, take care of the horse but also get to ride it on the side. Kinda like a lease but the owner still rides him/her as well and takes care of food costs. Is this something that a horseowner would look into since it would be much cheaper for them and I would also have the companion for my mare and could ride the horse too?    They would be able to come over anytime and ride and check on the horse and before anything was made sure they could come check the property out etc.

And by not much i mean, he only eats a little bit when i give him food at supper time, in the afternoon he just wont eat. Over the past few days ive switched puppy food, but he doesnt seem to want those either. Finally yesterday I put a bit of peanut butter in the food, but hed only get the bits covered in peanut butter and spit the food part out.    Finally last night, i tried giving him some wet food and he ate that hesitantly, bu he finished most of it. But his poop was wet looking.    I am kind of worried about giving him wet food, because i dont want to spoil him and dont want him to never eat dry food again, but i dont know.        What should I do???

20090309123124AACvbLu	Pets;Dogs	What 'grinds your gears' of other pet owners?	What really annoys you about other pet owners?      some for me are:      - abusing or neglecting them   - not clipping their nails   - not picking up after them   - not training them   - not spaying or neutering them   - not fixing them because you want them to have a litter first   - improper use of training devices (choke, pinch, and shock collars)      There is nothing worse then a dog barking in your face and biting your hands off because it hasn't been taught not too. Then jumping up on you and you feel like you're being stabbed because their nails jab into you.      lets say these people are your friends or relatives.. how do you let them know how you feel? How do you approach them on such a subject?      What grinds your gears?   just curious.

There have not been any problems with the littler box until a few weeks ago.  I put down this mat so the litter would not track, 1 peed all over it.  Cleaned it up, washed with Wisk and then did it again.  I went back to the original set up and then he peed under 2 bathmats then I actually saw him stand in front of his box squat and pee.  The vet told me this morning its prob more behavioral and to keep him separated in a room with food water and a litter box for 2-3 days.  Does this sound right?  And if so does this actually work?  He is such a social cat I feel horrible to do this to him.....

She has to be sedated at the vet for them to be able to do any type of exam or vaccination.

20090309123507AAaJyPE	Pets;Rodents	I have a couple questions about guinea pigs as pets, any experts?	just got my baby guinea pig a couple weeks ago.   he's 3 months old now, i think.      i've been feeding him his regular pellets, timothy hay, and have been giving him a medium sized leaf of romaine lettuce every day or every other day (which he loves). and of course he always has fresh water. i fed him a little bit of an orange yesterday because i read that it's alright and he needs the vitamin c, but he didn't seem to like it haha. i take him out and play with him for almost an hour every night. he squeaks around and bites on a lot of stuff and does this weird bouncy twitchy thing that i found out is called 'popcorning,' and it's so cute haha. i put some smallish wooden block shapes in his cage for him to chew on to make sure his teeth are wearing down as much as they should be. he's kind of small right now, about the size of my two palms put together to hold him- but he's growing fast and i think i'm going to need a bigger cage soon.       so here are my questions:   am i feeding him right? does he need anything else? more or less vegetables? fruits? what do you feed your guinea pig every day?    how big of a cage should i get? and would i need to get an even bigger cage if i decided to get another guinea pig to keep him company, or can they both live comfortably in the same size cage?   is his popcorning thing normal? haha, do your guinea pigs do that too?      and is it alright that i'm not always super super gentle with him? i mean i'm never  rough with him, but i'm trying to get him to get used to sudden movements and weird sounds so that he'll be more comfortable with being held, and me and being in my bedroom. is that alright? i don't want him to be scared and hyped up forever haha.      whew. any help from people who actually own guinea pigs would be very appreciated. thanks. :)      oh, also, i've owned hamsters and gerbils and stuff before, so i'm not that new to small animal care- i'm just trying to figure out guinea pigs specifically lol.       thankss!

20090309133203AAWjeK1	Pets;Dogs	My dog is wheezing, coughing, and gasping for breath, but only at night.?	We got a new puppy, 16 weeks old, a yellow lab.   Since day one, he has been wheezing, coughing and gasping for breath until he finally hacks up what must be some kind of mucus or something.  It never comes out of his mouth, but we can tell something comes up.  Sometimes he gags so hard mucus comes out of his nose.  This only happens at evening/night time.   We were honored one vet visit by the office the pet store uses and they said he was fine. But this doesn't seem normal, and it's getting a little worse.  Anyone else ever see these symptoms in a puppy? Did he outgrow it?    I am wondering if I was sold a sick dog.
20090309133656AAAamfg	Pets;Dogs	My finace had to give my chihuahua cpr, 2 days later and he's still not right?	We have a 3 lbs male 18 month old chi, we moved into a new house on saturday (from a flat), my fiance went upstairs to the bathroom for about 30 secs, when he came back downstairs he noticed wolfie (chi) on his back on the bottom stair and his tongue was hanging out of his mouth and turning blue, my fiance couldnt feel a heart beat and he wasn't breathing. He gave him cpr (he had recently been on a first aid course thank god) and after about 2-3 mins wolfie came around.      We think he's fallen down the stairs and bumped his head, although none of us saw anything.      He's been checked for broken bones etc and hasn't got any, he doesn't seem to be in any pain but he's acting very strange.      He seems very dazed, he stares into space for ages, only responds to his name half the time, will only eat if hand fed, he wee'd on my sister the other day which he has never done before even when he was a puppy (he has only done that once though), he is also very needy, always wanting to sit on our laps even though when he does sit there he doesnt relax, just sits there staring at nothing. He is slow on his feet, slow reacting in general, he hasn't been near our other chi (usually best friends) in days-Brutus didn't do anything to him he was in another room-and he isn't interested in anything anymore.      Is he in shock or something?  We have no idea what's up, I don't think it's a physical problem I think it my be psycological becuase he doesn't seem to be in pain. Is this normal behavoir after a fall/after having cpr?      Any suggestions would be great         ps we have since installed a fabric/mesh baby gate at the bottom of the stairs to prevent him going up

20090309161908AAM6kCm	Pets;Birds	J-Where can one buy tapes that teach birds to talk?	I recently have aquired a year old Cockatoo. She is very sweet and has taken quite an interest in talking. So far all we have done was say "Hello," constantly, and she tries her very best and gets frustrated and then takes a small nap and shes better, but I know she has the potiental to talk. The people we bought her from told us she could already say hello, goodbye, and lovely, although she is still working on these. I heard these "tapes" work very well to teach a bird to talk so you don't have to sit there all day teaching her to talk. Where could I find these? Do they work? What do you know about birds and talking? Do you think she is too young to start talking? Is it weird for her to still not be able to talk? Did those breeders lie to us about talking? TELL ME EVERYTHING! Please..:)
20090227144110AAIEfLG	Pets;Cats	What's up with Mom and Daughter cat mothering each other's babies?	I have two cats, Lisa and Snoop. Lisa is Snoop's Mom. Lisa just had her forth litter the second of which Snoop has been around to see. Snoop is a huge suck, always has been. When Lisa had her last litter, Snoop was right beside her during the labor and delivery and then started nursing off Lisa again ~ Snoop was like 6 months at that point. No harm I thought, Lisa is a very opinionated cat and I knew once she was annoyed she'd kick Snoop in the head ~ which she eventually did do. So last night Lisa goes into labor ~ I swear had I not woke when I did she would have had the kittens on my pillow. Snoop has been acting SOO weird! We keep hearing the babies, then finding them in random places around the house like behind the dryer or under my son's bed ~ ALL Snoop's doing. We catch her every little while walking around the house with one of the babies in her mouth, looking all confused. My husband (who is on vacation this week) is so cute standing in the hall shouting at Lisa "LOOK!! would you LOOK what she's doing to your babies! LISA!! What is she doing!?" LOL Lisa pays no attention and shows no concern. I'm not concerned either really, it's not like she's gonna eat them. She's just playing OR maybe it's because Snoop is now pregnant herself?? What do you think? Has anybody ever had a similar experience? The last time I went and checked on Lisa and the babies in their huge box Snoop was literally laying on top of Lisa and it looked to me as if one of the babies was trying to nurse from Snoop. Snoop is due in a couple weeks. Do you think these babies will even know which is their mom? I have no doubt Snoop will join Lisa in the box with her babies and Lisa will likely help groom/feed them. Is there anything wrong with that? Is this normal in the cat world? To like share the mothering duties between mom and daughter?

20090309161135AAdSTAM	Pets;Dogs	If i call myself a dog trainer is that the same or different as a professional trainer?	I think I dont understand some deffiniotions in their legal terms. I am 14 and i can train a dog basic commands and tricks and other stuff too, so i think of myself as a trainer. Because i CAN train a dog to do something.       Lets say someone i know gets a cut, if i put neosporin and a band-aid on it i consider myself to be a doctor. i know i dont have a medical degree and i never went to med school but i aided the wound therefore i think of myself as a doctor.       Can i call myself a dog trainer even though i cant get a lisence. Im not calling myself a proffessional trainer just a trainer or even a trainee. is that ILLEGAL?Because to me if i can train dogs to not bark or to act correctly when nervous or if i can train them recall or the bacis commands or to pick something up and bring it to me i consider myslf a trainer because i trained the dog to do something. Now if I want to pass on my ability to train my dogs onto other dogs in my neighborhood by teaching them the same things if i dont have a lisence because im not old enough is that LEGAL or ILLEGAL?       i hope you understand what im trying to say.          Thanks for all your help and kind words, and please if your just gonna get mad at me and tell me to stop asking these questions then please dont leave anything at all. I just want to know as many ways to work with my comunity and work with dogs and train them if its LEGAL for me to do right now.      please dont get mad at me for asking similar questions for the fifth time now, i just want to know if it is legal and then i want as many other options or choices of things i can do untill i can get my lisence. thanks :D      RIGHT NOW I HELP BY:   -I have a dog walking service   -I foster dogs and cats   -I train my friends dogs and puppies   -I volenteer at animal shelters to help clean their cages   -I volenteer at animal rescue foundations to help get dogs and cats adopted...   >>>specificaly the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation   -I volenteer at my local veterinary hospital to play with the animals that stay over night. they shouldnt have to feel lonely :)         THANKS AGAIN!

20090227144238AA9GHeP	Pets;Rodents	Good diet for my hamster?	I just added a little baby Fancy hamster to my family. I bought a bag of hamster food, but it has a lot of corn kernels and sunflower seeds, which I've read are only good in moderation, seeds, and little colorful things that look like flattened Cheerios. I usually add some carrot or celery to the bowl, so she gets some veggies. Is this good? What would be better?      Bailey and I thank you :)
20090225090934AAiMdzj	Pets;Birds	Are my cockatiels mating?	I have 2 cockatiels, I assume I have one male and one female by visually sexing them. The one I think is a male I think is a lutino and has bright cheeks with no barring on the tail feathers. He is generally white with yellow tinges in areas especially in the face. The other is a grey mutation of some kind with two of her feathers being barred but again with bright cheeks.   The grey is more interactive with me and seems the dominant of the pair being both more vocal, investigative and wants to preen me all the time.   The grey will climb onto the lutinos back and start shaking its tail feathers which I assume is the mating action, but I have always thought the male is supposed to mount the female not the other way around. Have I mis-sexed the cockatiels or do I simply have two males with one being very randy?

I just got her Wedesday and she was a little bigger then the rest but I thought it was a different breed. They called her a dalmation mouse. White with black spots. Her tummy is rather large and she waddles when she walks.(a girl mentioned to me about two bumps by the spine when you lift the tail) what do you look for there? I noticed last night she slept outside she box she had bee sleeping in. I know in human medicine isnt that the restlessness before birth? I do want the babies just curious because shes not as big as the ones on google. Also I have another female in with her is that ok? Peanut the pregant one is acting like a mom to her to Jelly is just a baby herelf . Is that part of nesting should I separate Peanut and Jelly if peanut does have babies?

20090227150454AAdczie	Pets;Rodents	Can I get add another silky hamster to the cage?	I bought a silky hamster about one and half weeks ago, she was only 4 weeks when I got her, and evidently she was pregnant when I bought her.  Although they weren't sure, they said it is a possibility because of their mix up at the store.  Anyway, now she has four babes, and I would like to keep one.  However I have heard that she will eat them.  I don't understand how other people can have two, and how hamster farmers have two in a cage without them killing eachother.  Is there a way or something that I can do to be able to keep one of her babes in the same cage as herself, it is quite a large cage with tubes and such so they wouldn't be crowded together.

Every time I ask her she immediately says no without giving a proper reason. I don't want a pair of rats due to the fact that one will either get pregnant if i have a male/female pair or one will get killed by its cage mate if i have a male/male or female/female pair. Is there anything I can possibly do to convince her to let me have one. Yes I've done all the "i'll take care of it" and stuff like that.      On a side note, my dad did have 2 guinea pigs as a kid but me nan ended up looking after both of them. Also, the reason why I live with my grandparents is because my mum died and by dad dumped me on them due to the fact that he doesn't know how to raise a kid. But that bit is unimportant.

20090309171808AAWRf6V	Pets;Cats	Diabetic cat DON'T up the units until you read this anyone hear of this?	I have a cat that has been a diabetic for almost 6 years.  I have always given her the injections 2 a day at her neck scruff. First in the middle after a few years I noticed it was tougher to shoot that area, called the Vet, was told I can shoot to the side of the scruff too. I have been doing that few more years and now started to shoot the flank area. I wanted to give some info I learned today from a human with diabetes for 17 years.  He says at times it seemed his vile of insulin was not working. He talked to his Dr and was told that if you keep shooting the same spot over and over it may actually get encapsulated in the scare tissue that has built up over the years and may not get to the body when it needs it and can actually come out and absorb at time you DON'T need it.  I think this was info we all needed to know and investigate. I have wondered why my kittys BG does not change much at times. This lead me to think my vile of insulin was not working too.       This problem can lead an owner to a raise the units given at next dose... this can be dangerous. PLEASE if you have been giving shots over and over in one spot and you think the insulin isn't working, try shooting in a new spot next time BEFORE you raise the UNITS, just to be safe. Anyone hear of this?

20090309113444AAlSGIw	Pets;Dogs	What makes a dog become food aggressive?	We have two dogs, one male one female. They got along fine and then the male became aggressive. The male was not socialized except with my female and so he doesn't do well with new people or dogs. I noticed one day that he would be aggressive whenever the female would even walk by the food bowl. His owners leave food out 24/7 and he has three bowls that are always filled. Two in the kitchen and one in his bedroom. The female doesn't eat his food because she knows I don't allow it (it causes vomiting and diarrhea). Then when I feed the female the male will come up and start eating out of it too and then get aggressive when she continues to eat from her own bowl. He also eats his food like he hasn't eaten in days. I can't do anything about his aggression because it's not MY dog, I wouldn't get consistent cooperation from everyone in the house to work with him and I don't have money for a professional. I just want to know why he became aggressive and acts like he never gets fed. Although the male is the alpha (I think) my female is never afraid to challenge him. I think she was alpha first but then the male took over because of his aggression. So what do you think? I'm not looking for the 100% correct answer to my situation just opinions and a general idea about why the male is aggressive.

We have the house now but are doing remodeling and leveling it and everything.       It's going to have carpet and tile floors and be about 1,000- 1,200 sq feet. We have about 6 or 7 acres but haven't gotten it all fenced in and it will probably be a while before we do so. We do have a large portion fenced behind the house though. We want a larger dog, definitely not a small one and we want one that won't shed a ton. (I'm going to vacuum everyday so one that doesn't shed excessively) We have one other dog, he's a german shepard/ husky mix that is about 3. We want him to have a companion (he's nuetered and acts like a puppy) but we also want a dog that will be protective but not agressive unless need-be.

I don't know. ok:   when i was riding today, Im getting ready for a show this Saturday and there were other girls, about 10 and 11 who are going too. one of the girls is riding the same horse i am in the show but she got to ride him today. now i have been working with him for a LONG time to get his right lead canter because he was never been able to pick it up. this girl ruins all my hard work every time. well the other girl, the 11 year old is great, we are great friends and she is respectful of the horse and is responsible. the 10 year old, who rides my horse is not at all a respectful rider. she freaks out every time he picks up the canter when she asked him to and she messes up his leads that i work for hours on!! she also doesn't realize where she is going, she doesn't pay attention and gets in my way.   i Guess what im asking is, does it bother anyone else when other younger riders are not paying attention and are irresponsible? i know they are young but i don't know, i just might be crazy. it just gets annoying!!!            amd don't get me wrong! im not at all saying that all 10 and 11 year olds or younger are awful riders! there are just some that are irresponsible. not all. just don't get me wrong!

20090309171455AAiCoFj	Pets;Dogs	Help with a kennel name?	Hey guys, this is basically an opinion question!!  We are officially registering our kennel!! Although I have no idea as to what to name ourselves... our main studs name is Dozer, he is a short, stalky, red colored pitty(he is a texas rednose), he was our first real stud, and I would love for our kennel name to have something to do with him. We are in Atlantic Canada, out in the country... if you want any other details that may help out with a kennel name just let me know!! All I guess I am looking for here is some ideas!       Now, I don't need lectures, I am a responsible pitbull owner, and I am a respected breeder, I have had my mentors etc, and have successfully moved past that stage, building a strong name for ourselves and our dogs. I know about all of the genetic testing and all of the responsibilities that come along with being a breeder. It is a past time for me, not a career. I am currently in school for becomming a vet tech, yes, my dogs are registered, utd on shots etc. I do have a contract and everything else... the one thing I am lacking is a kennel name, because I lack imagination!! So if I can just get a couple of ideas here... it would be great!

I know he has to eat them for the Vitamin C but he wont eat them any more?   I give him a fresh slice every night and he used to have it gone by the next morning. In addition to oranges he also gets Parsley. Can he survive on Parsley alone? He gets hay and pellets everyday as well.      I had to recently separated him and my other male piggy. The older/bigger one was "beating" him up so I split them up for his safety.    Do you think he misses his "buddy"? They can still see each other....      Its been about 4 days since he has had a bite out of an orange and he seems normal.....      What can I do? Should I be worried?      Thanks.

In some sports, trainers/coaches say not to have sex before a game or before practice.      Does same go for horseback riding? I've been riding for years, but I just thought about this. I jump and train multiple horses, so it is strenuous. But does the sex thing go the same for riding? Is it best to hold off before riding? And why or why not?      Thank you!

20090308140041AAvt6yv	Pets;Other - Pets	Do you think my mum will get me a horse?	Okay I know its an extremely HIGH responsibility owning one, and very expensive...I don't want to rush into buying one...But 7 weeks ago I started going to lessons again, I'm getting really good at cantering and soon hopefully I'll be jumping...I've wanted a horse for really long now but I don't beg my mum for one, I've only asked twice, the answer was "its too expensive" and I understand it is.   My mum would definately buy me one I know she would, its just keeping it at my closest stables is ￡300 a month! So she can't afford that...I know there are other places out in essex though, anyway... I've got a really strong bond with the horses who participate in the lessons, I've watched how some girls take there own horses out for lessons..I'd love to have that feeling, riding my very own horse, to call it mine, to spend every day with it, care for it, compete...If it gets unwell I'd stay by it all day and comfort it...      As I said I really don't want to rush into this, I'm still learning alot more about them...But when I want something my mum will just get it! I'm NOT saying I'm spoilt, my mums just a really good mother, when I wanted a laptop I didn't even ask to get one and she got me one!   She watches how I play horse games on my wii, my ds, and look at horses for sale online...She speaks to her friends about how good I am at cantering now, she comes by and watches me for a little while too...But for some reason I don't think she'll buy me one. She said "when your older you'll have to get a job and good money to get one" I don't wanna' wait that long...      I've watched girls my age and there horses on youtube, I'm not asking for the moon, just a horse...Do you think I'd get one? I know you all don't know my mum..But what do you think?

20090309124131AAMYVY2	Pets;Cats	What do I control my crazy cat? Please read...?	I don't know what to do with him. He has been clawing the corners of my carpet and tearing it up. I have 3 scratching posts for him, but when I sleep at night, he claws my carpet instead. He runs across your feet on purpose and digs his claws in your skin when he does it; causing skin tears. Why? He gets on my kitchen counter, and knocks things over and licks the faucet. I've tried the water bottle thing, it doesn't work, he just does whatever when I am not around. He has toys and his mom to play with. I don't understand. He is 2 years old, and I have been putting up with it thus far because I love him. At this point, he needs to change or I have to put him out. I have a 4  month old baby and I don't want him digging his claws in her when she's starts to craw. I debunked the declawing idea. My friend says give it time, but his time is running out. Any suggestions?

20090309171705AAZxirY	Pets;Cats	Very Badly Behaved Cat!! advise needed!!?	My boyfriend got me a kitten for christmas one year ive had it since it was only weeks old. Hes now over a yr old and is huge. First of all he is very loving and affectionate, he follows me around the house and likes to 'cuddle' up to me as close to my face as possible! But he is a nightmare!! He thinks he is a raccoon!! He will eat anything from salt n vinegar crisps to spaghetti - nothing left out is safe. He manages to get into the bin and find any food leaving the rubbish all over the floor, shreds food sachets, constantly brings in dead mice+birds. He will eat anything and everything and steals the other cats food and growls while he eats.I have two other cats one is timid and is regularly attacked by the male cat, the other is also female but hisses and grows and manages to keep him away. I don't know whether he is trying to play or bully be we've tried neutering him and hasn't really changed. He also can turn vicious quickly, someone would be stroking him and he could just turn around and latch onto their hand and scratch! He scratches at door and meows till hes let in, I know shouldn't let him in but I always do!! He doesn't respond to    punishment, scolding, spray, doesn't seem to deter him at all! What should i do?? I love him very much but he is driving my family crazy!

20090308133247AAMWxsn	Pets;Other - Pets	Can anyone help me know how to socialize abused rabbit?	So, I just assumed responsibility of an abused rabbit. I know that he's skittish and shy for a reason and tries punch (yes, punch) me when I try to touch him.  He's about 2 years old I was told and he is litter box trained, but so scared of any human interaction!  I know it's going to take time but I was wondering if anyone (and I could use a LOT of answers please) tell me how I might help him along the way.  I've been sitting on the floor and letting him come to me, but every time I move even in the slightest he gets scared and either punches or runs away.  Thanks for any and all suggestions!!!      Oh yeah, the way I was told he was being abused was that he was always in his cage and being poked at with a stick.  He is now a free range rabbit.

20090309130522AAKopCt	Pets;Rodents	My new baby cavy doesn't seem very happy?	I Got a new baby Guinea Pig yesterday and he's so small, I'm not actually sure how old he is but he was in a cage with about 5 other older females and he just doesn't move unless there's sudden movement or noise. He lets me pick him up and stuff but he seems so scared and unhappy. I've heard him squeak when my other guinea pigs were squeaking. And I Think he's eating and drinking. So do you think he needs an extra companion as he's only a baby and was used to being in a cage with others. Or do you think he's just scared because he's in a new environment and doesn't really know me yet? Help? (:

20090309130327AA5FjC5	Pets;Dogs	HELP!  My dog bit another dog at the dog park?	My Rottie is 21 months old and is neutered.  Prior to being neutered he was always dominant.  once the other dogs submits he would play with them.  If they didn't he would pin them down and growl showing teeth.  I would correct him by laying him down on his side for a while or just remove him from the dog park.  I got sick of doing it all the time and had him neutered.      Now he only shows aggression with puppies ESPECIALLY boxer puppies.  So i keep an eye out for them while at the park.      i was at the dog park yesterday and didn't see one come in.  The puppy came up to my dog and my dog pinned him down a mauled him resulting in $400 in stitches.      Why is it Always puppies and boxer puppies that he hates? i correct as soon as i see his posture change.      Im thinking of muzzling and getting a shock collar........anything else i can do?      other than this problem he is well trained and obeys all my commands to the point where im always complimented on how well behaved he is at the park........UNTIL HE ATTACKED THE PUPPY....... im extremely upset and looking for help.
