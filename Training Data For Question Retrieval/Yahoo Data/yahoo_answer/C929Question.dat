20081216014405AAFP6nE	Business & Finance;Corporations	Which one would you hire?	Suppose you were interviewing a candidate for an entry-level job.  (forgive the sexist language, but for the sake of not having to type "he/she" over and over, let's assume the candidate is male).      He is well-qualified for the position, with a master's degree in a relavent field and a few years of experience.  He is personable and friendly.  He dresses nicely, and showed up on time for the interview.  He is willing to accept a very low starting salary.  He has virtually everything you could want from a candidate, but there is one significant flaw: his communication skills are lacking.  Subjects and verbs do not agree.  Grammatical errors abound.  Mispronunciations are everywhere.  Overall, conversations with him remind you of conversations you've had with your 4 year old nephew.      Let's assume that your other prospects are less qualified.  They don't have advanced degrees, have little or no previous experience, and expect to be payed higher starting salaries.  Let's assume, however, that their communication skills are better.  Grammar and pronunciation are generally correct, subjects and verbs agree, and they are relatively easy to talk to.      Who would you hire, and why?

I heard about all access, but they have so many fees to the card. Green Dot was really reasonable, but i heard a lot of people say that money tends to disappear off those (but apparently if you call Green Dot and mention a lawyer the money will mysteriously reappear). Can someone give me some alternatives. something reliable but affordable? (and is the green dot thing just rumors or is it really that bad?)

I recently lost my contractor job after my project budget was cancelled. Two colleagues highly recommended me for another project in the company.      At a hiring meeting for the new project, someone overheard a mid-level manager say I was unreliable and once didn’t finish an assignment. However, this is untrue. I never reported to that person and was never given an assignment by them. Unfortunately the hiring managers listen closely to the person saying untrue things about me and that may have cost me a job.      What can I do? Losing a job opportunity in this economy is a big deal and someone is smearing my name. Should I call the company’s HR department or a lawyer? Should I approach the ex-coworker and ask why they said those things about me (this could get the person who told me what was said in trouble)

Hello Everbody,      When there equity market in bad shape there is demand for treasuries which leads Treasury Yield to decrease ( Price Increases).      My question is, Does all the trasury maturity yields ( 3 month bill, 2 year Note and 10 Year Bond) decrease when equity market in bad shape ?I mean, if the treaury yield goes up which means all the maturity Treasury will go up & when the treasury yield goes down which means all the maturity Treasuries will go down?Is it so?      2.I was reading in the news everyday that 2 year yield increased more than other maturity and some other day 10 year maturity yield increased more than 2 year treasury note and sometimes 3 month bill yield increased more than any other maturity........Why is that happening?Why particular maturity yield is increasing or decreasing more than other maturity treasuries?What factors Influences that?Can you please explain to me in detailed and clear way like you explain to 5 year old kid.

I'm 16, almost 17, and I got a job at McDonald's sometime in August of last year. I was a good worker but I was late a few times (because I was fed up with the environment, manager and future prospects, but I ended up going in anyway). Anyway wrestling season rolled around and I hadn't been fired, but I quit without a 2-Week. I called the manager and she said it was ok, no problem that I quit, with a reassuring kind of tone. I think it might be better off for me to leave it off of my future applications because I'm afraid the manager will give me a poor reference. Is this a good idea? If anyone knows, could you tell me if that job would even show up if they tried to look up my job history? And would future employers even care to look at the history if they were thinking about hiring me for a low level position? I apologize for the amount of questions but just one more, What should I do otherwise if thats definately not a good idea? Thank you for your time and any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

20090309185933AAlXxPL	Business & Finance;Small Business	Non-Profit vs For-Profit?	I am starting my own business that is a charitable organization.  I think I want it to be a non-profit for tax purposes.  I think that would be the easiest way to raise funds.  But I am not sure, I was thinking of creating 2 ventures, 1. a for profit (because i think i will need more ways of raising money for my organization and for competitive salaries for my employees) and 2 a non-profit organization that would be a separate section of my for profit, but all the money with that organization would go directly to helping my cause, not to pay salaries etc etc.  So people donating money there will know it will go 100% to helping, and nothing will go to salaries or "extras"  Any help or ideas would be great.

I have never even been around drugs (knowingly) let alone done any, so I am not worried about the drug test.  My question is, do I have the job yet as long as I pass the drug test, or is there a possibility even if I pass it I might not get the position?  They also said that they would call me after they get the drug test back.

I'm stuck in a house that I will never see any value from even if I was to stay in it for the life of the loan. Homes comparable to mine (and bigger) in my neighborhood and in better communities are selling for 100k+ less than what I paid. Since I will never see any real value out of my current home, should I give up my house and look to buy a house in a few years? I understand a foreclosure can stay on your record for up to 10 years but from what I've read purchasing a home 3 years after foreclosure is not impossible.       Currently the Govt. is only bailing out corporate America and the folks stuck in ARM's. I don't fall in either category. I'd consider a short sale, but your credit is still screwed and I'd have to pay tax on the remaining balance. At what point does someone cut their losses and accept that they bought a home at the wrong time?      Thank you in advance for any advice, comments, criticism etc..etc..etc..
