afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I would paint the paneling a light color to make the room seem lighter and not so heavy. Light colors also make the room look larger. To cover the items in the cabinet you could put up curtains over erach or the areas where a door would go. A cheap way would be to jsut buy fabric and sew it yourself. It is a very simple way to make curtains and you would have a better choice in what you decorate with since store bought curtains are limited to certain designs.<br>  <br>  When someone says they dont have money for cabinet doors, why would you suggest cabinet doors?

EOE191zLaa	Sounds to me that when the blower was installed it may have been connected to the wrong speed,  blowers will usually have any were from 3 to 5 speeds.  If you have the manuel for the blower and or the furnace look to see what speed the blower should be set at. It may just have to be simply reconnected to a slower or faster speed you want slow(er) for heat fast(er) for cool those connections are mostly located at the circuit control board. if the board has spaces that say PARK those are reserved for speed connectors that are not in use. But it should have in the same location spaces that say Low, Low-med, Med,med-Hi, HI.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. also blocking intake vents will almost always cause problems sooner or later.|`|f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Sadly the only other item i can think of is the furnaces internal control panel. There could very well be a short or small disconnect which is causing the problem. When I first read your problem I was bothered by the register being covered, but if it worked properly prior to you turning down the heat and the register was covered then that might contribute to the problem but is not likely to be the entire problem. <br>  <br>  If the control panel is not the problem, then you may have to suffer through the repairman's visit to find the solution. Heating and Air systems can be difficult to diagnose without actually seeing them, so I hope my information helps you, and that you find your problem.
BTp9qzuNaa	Do you mean you run the hot tap for a while then it stops. Do you have a hot water tank in the airing cupboard and a cold water tank above it or a cold water tank in the loft. If you have you need to check if the cold water tanks is filling up.|`|v3xEtuLLaa	Pressure builds up in the pipe when it's closed.  When you open the faucet, you release the pressure which causes an initial burst.  As the pressure drains, what's in the pipe is not enough to force the water past the partially open valve.  You open it more, and it creates enough of an opening to let the lower pressure water through.  This could be caused by scale built up in your pipes or in the valve, or by low pressure in your hot water supply.  There are pressure tanks you can have installed on your water heater to correct this problem.  Hope this helps.|`|EmgiGg17aa	The tap washer screw is probably loose.

If you have a slab then it is a bit harder to tell if there is a cracked pipe and that typically has to be checked by either snaking the pipe with a video camera, or having a licensed plumber check the lines. <br>  <br>  If it is a cracked pipe you will have to use a plumber, if it is the dip tube, then you can order and replace those yourself, but be careful it is a bit tricky sometimes, and most people just opt to have the entire water heater replaced.|`|hL9V86Nlaa	First of all, you need to check to see if water is actually flowing threw the pipe or line.

f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Well I am not super familiar with oil burning heaters, but in residential construction the firebox is a kit which creates the surround for the fireplace, and these kits typically, due to the way they are made and installed, can not be replaced. <br>  <br>  However if your fire box is cracked you can have a mason come in and install thin firebrick in front of the kit and fire caulk all the various openings and the fireplace can then be used again. <br>  <br>  However this is for a standard wood burning style fireplace, and not knowing the specifics of your installation it is hard to tell if yours can be repaired.|`|8e3c1da786497f2130276d9d3c413210aa	Most fireboxes and heat exchangers are replaceable.

v3xEtuLLaa	How many people will be on this stage at one time?  I would recommend building it in 4' x 10' sections, each of which would require 4 10' joists and 1 8' rim joist.  You will need 4 legs on each as well, which I would make from 4x4's, so you have 2-10' 4x4's on each section.  Now, you will need the roof posts, which can be incorporated into the legs to save material.  Eliminate 6 of the legs and substitute 16' 4x4's.  You will need plywood for the top, 2-1/2 sheets per section.  5/8" should be good.  You will also need carriage bolts to attach the sections together, as well as attaching the legs and roof posts.  Here is your list:<br>  <br>  13-4x8x5/8" plywood<br>  20 @ 2x10x10'<br>  5 @ 2x10x8'<br>  7 @ 4x4x10'<br>  6 @ 4x4x16'<br>  <br>  8D nails-5 lbs<br>  16D nails-5 lbs<br>  12 @ 3/8" x 4" carriage bolts with nuts and washers<br>  40 @ 3/8" x 6" carriage bolts with nuts and washers<br>  <br>  Take this list to a local lumber yard or home center and they will price it out for you.

x86mC8yyaa	It depends on how much room you have for a compost heap, how much stuff you will have available to put in it, and what sort of materials you will be adding. On my allotment, where space is not a problem, I have made containers for my compost heaps by tying wooden pallets together to make cubes of about 1 cubic metre. Just tying them with rope is all you need to do as the compost soon forms itself into a cube and when you need it you just drop the front panel and dig it out. I have two heaps side by side. In order to make good compost you need to turn it every few weeks, so the stuff which was at the top and sides come to be at the bottom and in the middle, this makes it rot down faster and more evenly, and lets the air in. So I tip it from one container into the one next door. A big heap will be more effective than a small one, as it will get hotter, and the little plastic Dalek-shaped ones are less effective than an open cube because they don't let you get at the compost to turn it. To keep it nice and warm you need to cover the top of the heap - I use the sort of bubblewrap with large bubbles because it doesn't grow spores which can be dangerous to inhale. like carpet does. <br>  You use compost to feed the soil, and then this benefits the plants. It will greatly improve any kind of soil, by adding nutrients and also micro-organisms to benefit the soil structure and feed what grows there. There is no difference at all between compost for flowers and for vegetables. Good compost is of equal value for everything.|`|Vv465eJMaa	No it would not be worth it.Home made compost cannot be used for anything except digging into borders.The nutrient distribution is very uneven in home made compost,as the composter itself has an uneven heat distribution while matter is decomposing.<br>  So if you put it into flower tubs,you might find one part growing fast but too leafy,and another stunted growth with virus|`|sw2R5A9iaa	absolutely -find a spot in the yard away from the house and start digging.  separate this from the rest of the yard.  add your compostable materials from the garden & kitchen.  turn every few days.  within a few  months, you'll no longer need to use the garden shops.|`|df6e5b1a8d31db24d73d45f4db076d71aa	Absolutely!  I got one from my city at half the price than a hardware store (so check with your city waste management branch to see if they sell them).  I use the compost from mine in both my veggie garden and my planter boxes.  For the planter boxes, I mix the compost with potting soil and as the summer goes on, I add compost to the soil surface (to add nutrients to the soil as much of the nutrients leach out when you water the plants).  Make sure that you don't put the new compost directly on the plants because it can actually burn the plants.  I usually mix the compost into the upper levels of the soil a little.<br>  <br>  Also, the amount of garbage we put out now has decreased from 1-2 bags a week to probably 1/4-1/2 of a bag, all due to our composter!<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	You bet.

PvEEOdKBaa	I found a midcentury modern table with the neatest mechanisms and metal, teak and another type of metal legs.

V1HRJXM4aa	You can try washing it by hand with bleach and water. You can also try putting the curtain in the wash with towels for agitation. It is always better to use a non harsh cleaner. I would also use warm water.|`|PvEEOdKBaa	First of all, this fully depends on what type you have.  I have a commercial type one from walmart ran about 8 bucks it is cloth but repels water, I wash it about once every 2 weeks in a cold wash gentle and do not dry it.  I use a 1.00 liner from the dollar store and replace that every 3-6 months or so when it gets mildewy.  I pull my curtain closed when not in use and it hangs outside of the shower at that time.  I usually go a full 6 months with no mildew.  If yours has mildew and is a cheap plastic one you can wash it on gentle and warm (not cold or hot both will destroy it) but bleach is likely to ruin it by damaging the plastic, detergents do not wash back off etc.  just wash it by hand laid out on the floor.<br>  If you do use bleach and have a fabric one, use only about a fourth of a cup added to water when it starts agitating at the beginning after filling.  I always rinse my machine when I have used bleach- it is just a simple thing of setting it to spin a second time.  I have no idea what biological powder is sorry.  Gentle cycle is always best with anything that may be damaged- it may say delicate cycle.|`|3xufMetWaa	Compare the price of cleaning agents and your time, would it not be time and money consuming to invest in new shower curtain?

Making horse power of the motor almost unimportant, in that amount of water.  Next each filter can only turn over so many gpm (gallons per minute) no matter what. For example your current 100 sq. ft cart. can probably only turn over 100 gpm even if you put a 2 hp motor on it. Cartridge filters by the way have the highest flow rate of all the styles. True motor strength can effect this but it's only a piece of the factor. Size of the lines and length is also a big factor in gpm. 5000 gallons is not that much water I'm guessing about a 15' round. When I sold pools a 1hp motor was the standard option on the smaller sizes until about a 24' round pool and the 1.5hp was the upgrade option. Pretty much rest easy and save the money and go with the 1hp system. It is still plenty for that size pool and so is the 90 sq. cart. The 1hp also will use less electricity and you can save on that bill as well.

Mine wilts in the summer the same as in the winter if I don't water it enough.|`|0MunIx8raa	Find a spot in the house that doesn't have a direct draft on the plant.  Once you get it there, don't move it.  These plants like to be in one spot and one spot only.  Make sure it's out of the way so you aren't bumping into it when you walk by it.  Also it should have some sunlight, just not direct sunlight.  I wouldn't put a sheet over it.  These plants don't like to be messed with..so if you lay a sheet over it every night it won't be happy.  Just sit it in a warm, non-drafty, out of the way spot and leave it be.  Don't over water it either.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add: Put a towel around the bottom of the window seal and over the top of it to minimize the draft.  These plants grow very well inside a home as long as they stay put in one spot.  They are also pretty hard to kill.  So thanks for the thumbs down.  I did grow these for a living, amongst other plants for over 10 years.  So take whatever advice you feel you need.
AA10108322	This year I'm starting my plants indoors, then I'm going to transplant them outdoors after the last frost.  But last year I started my garden mid May by getting some plants from a garden center and it worked out well.  (I'm trying from seeds this year to cut down on costs)  You should wait until the last frost to plant, although there are some veggies, like potatoes, carrots, and onions, that can withstand a little bit of frost.  If you do plant your garden and notice that you got a frost during the night, go out in the morning and water them with the hose to melt off any of the frost on the plants.  Also, check the back of the seed packets.  Some veggies need a higher temperature for seed germination than others.  Those you'll need to start indoors or plant when the danger of frost is gone.  But, Like I said before, it's super easy if you just wait till May and buy your plants from a nursery.  <br>  I hoped this helped some.  Good luck gardening!<br>  <br>  Note: I was reading the answer before mine, and I've read that you should water in the morning.  If you water at night, the water sits in the soil (Because it can't evaporate) and can cause root decay.

It is not for treating pain just after a surgery unless you were already taking it before the surgery.<br>  <br>  OxyContin may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.<br>  <br>  What is the most important information I should know about OxyContin?<br>  <br>  OxyContin may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. OxyContin should never be given to another person, especially someone who has a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a secure place where others cannot get to it. Do not drink alcohol while you are taking OxyContin. Dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with a narcotic pain medicine. Check your food and medicine labels to be sure these products do not contain alcohol. Never take more than your prescribed dose of OxyContin. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain. OxyContin can cause side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be awake and alert. Do not stop using OxyContin suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.

Gypsum (CaSO4) will also add calcium, an essential nutrient in plant growth, to soil.  Gypsum also contains Sulfur which will lower soil PH (more acidic). <br>  The gypsum will also aid in 'breaking up' (by allowing moisture to pass through) clay soil. If you have a thin layer of topsoil, this will allow your roots to more easily penetrate clay soil. <br>  <br>  If you have a 5-6" inches of a good loamy, compost/topsoil mix, you should get enough moisture absorption to keep compost/topsoil mix moist for good plant growth.  You can always augment with more peat moss is mix dries out too quickly. <br>   <br>  If you have a problem with standing water or poor drainage, they the clay soil may be saturated and tilling gypsum into the clay soil will alleviate this.  You can always re-soil test and determine the overall PH of soil.  If topsoil in growth zone (first 6"-8") is too acid, you can always add more lime to raise PH.<br>  <br>  Below the growth zone, it will not matter what soil PH is, but if clay soil is trapping moisture and causing a drainage problem, it will adversely affect your plantings.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	the clay is acidic<br>  the compost is acidic<br>  the manure is acidic<br>  and there's topsoil...??<br>  where's the alkaline stuff?....<br>  <br>  get a soil test done!!!... that's the only way you'll know how much of anything you NEED or whether you need anything at all.... likely you'll need some lime....

Gypsum is not toxic (this is what farmers use in clay soils), and doesn't change the PH, (you should also check into dolomite).

You need to add compost to the clay as deep as you can manage.  I put a garden in where it was nothing but blue clay.  I added lime to the soil as well as 6 or more inches of compost to it.  I hand dug 18in deep in a method called double digging. Then every year following I added as much compost as I could manage.  Oh and by the way I would not buy anymore topsoil, because what you need to do is keep adding compost.  Topsoil is very heavy, very pricey, and you never are really sure what you are going to get.<br>  <br>  Your plant's roots will not grow too far into the clay because there is nothing there for them.  Something that you might want to do for the first year or two is put in a raised bed so the plants have a little more growing room before they hit the clay. After a couple of years of really working the soil, your clay get better and better.<br>   If you live in an area where it is really warm the clay will work to your advantage, in holding in moisture.|`|x86mC8yyaa	I think it really depends on how deep a layer of topsoil and compost you have, and whether this has been dug in to the clay or just left on top. One of your problems may well be with drainage if the clay is solid, and in order to promote better drainage and also release the fertility in the clay, you really need to keep on turning the soil and digging in the additions gradually over quite a long period, adding lime when you do, so it steadily gets incorporated.  I would think that you would be OK to plant most vegetables, especially those that don't have very deep roots, so long as there's enough fertility in the top layer to keep them going for what is after all quite a short season. Maybe it would be best to hold off on planting permanent things like fruit bushes or trees, or at least dig out really good-sized holes and filling with compost, manure and topsoil before putting in the plants.|`|LfUTTJA4aa	Depends what you're growing.

Dab it or spray it in a spray bottle. Let that sit for a few hours, then soak it with towels. If you use a wet-dry vac, that will work, but sometimes the vac then retains the odor. YUCK!  Also, white vinegar will neutralize the odor. After letting the area dry for a couple of days, sprinkle corn starch on the area and let that sit for a few hours , then vacuum.

t5xnbgKkaa	The best herbs, partly because they grow easily and partly because they are used quite a lot in the kitchen, are basil, chives and garlic chives. If you want to grow mint then the best flavoured is apple mint and like other mints it is invasive and should be kept firmly to its own space. Apple mint is most easily bought as a plant from a garden centre but the others can all be grown quickly and easily from seed..and can either be planted out neatly in window boxes or trenches and grown to full size, or crowded into four inch pots and kept well watered with the leaves being taken often and more pots sown every couple of weeks until the end of May.<br>  Ishikura spring onions are shallow rooted, easy to grow and can be picked from about six weeks on..they also happen to have a great taste and take less space and time than other varieties, I have grown them in seed trays when short of space. Gold Rush courgettes are early fruiters and produce a lovely buttery yellow and thin skinned fruit that can be picked from six or seven weeks on, they are great raw in salads or thinly sliced and fried quickly in a little butter and a pinch of black pepper. Lettuce grows well but is ready just when it is cheapest in the shops, however if you use the Mixed Salad Bowl leaves you will get a variety of colours and these lettuce can have the leaves cut for use and the plants left to grow again if you cut them early the first time. There area also miniature cauliflowers, Snowball, and melons that can be grown in containers, sweet peppers and tomatoes as well, but if you grow tomatoes then choose what is called a "determinate" variety..one that grows to a limited height and does not need staking.<br>  You do not really save any money by growing your own, in fact with some things it can cost a little more..lettuce for instance, but the taste is totally different from supermarket or greengrocer produce which can, after all, be on the shelves for more than a week before you buy it...as soon as any vegetable is picked it begins to loose flavour and as they are picked before they are fully ripe in order to extend their shelf lives, what you buy in the shops is nothing like what you grow for yourself. If you find that you have room for carrots, they grow nicely in small black buckets, or ten inch pots..and if you  want to grow strawberries then you can buy special pots for them from garden centres or seed companies such as Thompson and Morgan ( they list them as Strawberry patio planters ). I know that you were asking about salads and herbs, not fruit, but thin slices of strawberry are delicious in salads ).|`|qgLb7YMEaa	you can now buy mixed leaf salad seeds of which you can sow and harvest when the leaves are young so you can keep picking and re-sowing,great for pots in a sunny position. these are ready to eat in 4/5 weeks of sowing.easy to grow,nutritious mixed leaves.<br>  as for herbs, thymes, sage, rosemary,lemon balm etc. which also have lovely fragrances.|`|968461807de2949a229454ee0782f7a8aa	The best salads grown in pots are tomatoes, sweet peppers, radishes, spring onions, ridge cucumbers (which have a trailing habit) and 'cut and come agan' leaves like rocket, and 'spicy salad leaves (Johnsons) and 'salad bowl mixed' rather than the type of lettuces that need pricking out at measured intervals (iceberg,cos and little gem) - read the back of the packets before buying.<br>  Most herbs like warm sunny places, I would grow basil, corriader, chives flat leaved parsley (better flavour) and thyme, and rosemary if you have room for a bush (or the upright variety), as these are the ones most commonly used in the kitchen.|`|yNE7qzOhaa	Try growing some leaf lettuces and arugula in a window box or big container.

Mj5hmRQwaa	Color is a very personal thing and everyone is drawn towards certain colors.  The color in your room is affected by where you live, and the direction your windows face.  It isn't just affected by your own personal preferences, style, and the size and shape of your room.  It is also affected by the lighting.<br>  <br>  General guidelines:<br>  North facing room-or room with little sunlight:<br>  yellows, pinks and reds<br>  South-or room with bright sunlight/all day:<br>  most will look good-especially golds & creams.<br>  East-or morning sunlight:<br>  greens & blues<br>  West-or evening/afternoon:<br>  peaches & terracottas<br>  <br>  Any room with plenty of light will suit deep dramatic & vibrant colors.  Dark rooms suit pastel, pale & cooler tones, as well as white.<br>  Rooms used mostly in the evenings will suit deep colors, better than pale ones.  Generally, decorate large rooms in dark or vibrant, & small rooms in pale colors.<br>  <br>  A high contrast color to your furniture will be beautiful with your dark furniture but it will also appear that you have more furniture in the room as it highlights it, thus accentuating the heaviness.  So, keep that in mind.  A blending color will fade your furniture into the wall.  Look to your wood tone for cues.  It will cast off another color, red, orange, ect. <br>  <br>  Red is an aggressive color, and can make you feel very restless - so not a good choice for bedroom in my opinion.<br>  Green is calming - so a good choice as well as neutral cream.<br>  Brown is warm, solid & secure & looks good against all colors.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend you choose your bedding first to get your color scheme going and then pull from it keeping the above points in mind.<br>  <br>  Read these 4 pages in the link.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	If it's an old building, it probably has old galvanized piping. These pipes in time will eventually rust on the inside giving the water a darker color. And although it taste horrible, it is not poisonous in any way. Once the rust builds up enough to close the waterway, It's time for new pipes. Nowadays they use copper and plastic pipes which don't rust and last much longer. <br>  Hard water is water which contains a lot of natural minerals or salts. Again, not poisonous. But the water is harsh on clothing in the washer. It's also the main reason for water heater failure. One way to check the water condition is to look inside the toilet tank. If the inside surface of the tank is red or blackish, and if there are small sand-like particles on the bottom, then you definitely have hard water. A water softener would remove the minerals, but might not be feasible for an apartment building. <br>  If you drink tap water, then I would suggest an under-the-sink filter system on the kitchen faucet.|`|aaebb9ddf7ee02705c8714bb2d74bc81aa	no get it checked out it sounds like it could be dangerous or even hazerdous|`|RQdFRaANaa	Hard water is not necessarily bad to drink.

00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Just for informational purposes, Eureka and Electrolux, or Aerius as it's now known,  are now one company.  Not sure which one bought the other one out, but one entity owns both.   Eureka's have been enjoying a good reputation for the last few years, and for the most part, deservedly so.   They've been at the business a long time and although for many years, the quality left something to be desired at times, they seem to have sucked it up, so to speak and have come out swinging.  Hoover's Wind Tunnel series of  vac's have been doing very well as well and seem to be very reliable.  They are also available in a self propelled model for a slightly higher price.  They can be had  for $150 - $180.  Consumer reports rates "bagged" cleaners above bagless cleaners, and so do I, mostly because of two things.  Folks who use bagless cleaners, mostly completely forget about cleaning the filters and frequently burn up the motors because of it, and when they find out how expensive the filters are they usually hit the ceiling.|`|vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A friend who has pets and kids bought a Eureka boss smart vac ultra 4870 and she loves it. She said it was recommended by consumer reports magazine and rated right up there with higher priced vacuums. It outperformed the Dyson animal. It was priced around 150.00 and really cleans carpets and bare floors with the flick of a switch. Has hepa filtration for allergies, 8 carpet settings, convenient tools and ability to control suction when using tools. Eureka also rated in the top two for the fewest repairs. You can check out consumer reports magazine online or for free at your local library.

It is AWESOME! It is only 160dollars and worth it. I find it easy to clean the filter and dust bin. All you have to do is empty the dust bin after you vaccum so you don't clog it. Then like every 5 vacs or so take the filter(s) out and rinse them out in the sink and let them dry over night. There are three pieces to the filter system. It is very simple. Also the powerpaw tool is good for cleaning the steps and furniture espeically if you have animals. The vaccum also has a easy view system on the front so you can see easily if the spinner wheel may be getting clogged with hair and stuff. Then you can detect it early and clean it. It is a overall great vaccum and have not had any problems with it in the 2 months I have had it. I would highly recommend it. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Btw you can use this vac on the hardwood floors! =)|`|bxlYleZkaa	I have had a small Electrolux Mondo for years. It cost ￡49.99 and is brilliant.

dXrHoLMCaa	I called up the folks at Sherwin Williams and they said.... <br>  <br>  can't change the sheen in the can... but you can paint with it and then add a layer of sheen on top of it once it's dry... using Polycrylic if it's waterbased paint and polyurethane if it's oil based paint.... be sure to grab the GLOSS in either one!!... *smile*....<br>  <br>  personally?... I would use the satin sheen inside the closet or in another room as an accent wall and go buy the right stuff for this project... I'd be afraid of the poly going yellow... ya know?.....<br>  <br>  there's another way to use the satin.... tape off foot-wide stripes vertically... and paint the satin on every other one.... it will make a very subtle pattern that you won't see unless the light shines on it just right.... and then, if you wanted, you could use one whole wall with just the satin, like you planned it thataway!!...|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Yes!

Go online to the manufacturer's website, or call customer service.  Also ask the paint store guy--sometimes they know something.<br>  <br>  Another option is to finish painting whatever it is with your satin paint, then "paint" over it with a clear water-based high gloss finish coat, like Minwax.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If it is returnable, that is the best solution. But you can buy and mix in a volume of microscopic glass beads, in the same quantity as the  paint, and thoroughly mix.<br>  Beside giving a sheen, this will make the surface scratch resistant.<br>  <br>  There are treatments that are specific to the kind of paint you bought.
LLeQyWGcaa	you will more than likely have to take the back panel off the washing machine. make sure to unplug it first before you do this. the drive belt and motor should be there in the back and you would be able to spot easily if the belt is broke.  if it has slipped off, just put it back on the pulleys. i would replace it as soon as possible if this is the problem for once they come off once, they tend to keep on coming off. when you get your new one, just take the old one off and put the new one by putting the belts over the pulley. if there is a tension pulley. loosen it , take the old belt off, put the new one on and re tighten the tension pulley.
WtqsWctjaa	Some manufacturers recommend using a penetrating sealer first and then the polish, others say the penetrating sealer is a waste of time and money because everything penetrates the tiles. 4-5 coats of the floor polish will do a good job of protecting your tiles. you can find a good one in my source site.|`|mWkkh9L7aa	Just know that you will have more maintenance if you want shiny saltillo because you will need to use a top coat sealer.

It is a common occurrence to look at a silver piece and find a hallmark of some type. Many pieces use pictorial signs and very little actual writing. This site will tell you how to research silver hallmarks and even give you some web sites to help in that research. When you are finished, you will be able to tell what company an item was made for, when it was made within a few years and, in many cases, who did the actual smithing of the item. Hope this helps.
v3xEtuLLaa	What you will run into depends on where you live.  Here in Wisconsin, the frost is 34" deep right now.  You can still dig, but you have to make sure that you are below the frost.

jW8nfcA6aa	You definitely have a problem. 1. Go out to the Heat Pump and shut it off, there is a switch mounted right by it.( shut off your electric furnace too ) 2. Go to a store and buy 3 to 5 small ceramic heaters ( some work better than others so buy different ones and take back and trade the ones you don't like ) for temporary heat needs. 3. Call or Web BGE and see if the have any current energy or tax break incentive programs going on. Here in Oregon our PGE has constant programs like that. 4. Have someone crawl under the house or attic,depending on your configuration, and inspect the heat ducts for inefficiencies like gaping holes or MIA. ( at one time we had $600 energy audit/installation incentive ) 5. If everything is good duct wise, then buy a new energy efficient heat  pump and possibly and elect. furnace if the yours isn't in good shape.(that was another incentive, free furnace ) Heat Pumps are rated for efficiency like this: Minimum efficiency HSPF 8.2, SEER14, EER 11.5,  These are minimum scores, the higher the numbers the more $$$$ you save.  Now after all this, if your current heat pump is fairly new and already rated high enough, then it could be repaired and recharged. You have to do something, because $900 a month for a 4 bedroom is insane. Best wishes.

0h9aD7Toaa	The evaporator was designed to have a certain amount of air blowing through it, changing the motor really is not an option, you will end up with a frozen evaporator and maybe even liquid refrigerant getting back into the compressor which is not a good thing..<br>      A dehumidifier would be a much better option for you.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Call another HVAC firm and ask them.<br>  A dehumidifier might be the cheapest solution.

It makes it look messy. A house without landscaping, and there are some, looks a little bare, but so much neater. I would prefer to have plant beds out in the yard. Just a personal preference.|`|YMwUpBIAaa	those are laurals. they make realy nice trees, but dont look good as shrubs. you can get rid of them and maybe keep one of them and let it grow as a tree, or get rid of all of them and replace it with a nice shrub maybe one that flowers. the best shrubs are according to where you live, but judgeing by the shrubs you already have here are a few that should do nice. you may need to look up cold tolerance for some of these so i will start with the least cold tollerant ones.<br>  <br>  indian harthorne- a really nice evergreen shrub. not too cold tollerant but the flowers are amazing.<br>  camellia- some verieties are more cold tolerant than others, but all look nice, have colorful flowers, and are evergreen.<br>  evergreen solomons seal, looks kind of like a minature palm tree and is quite cold tolerant.<br>  sabal minor- a palm tree that is cold tollerant to 3F probably the second most cold hardy palm in the world. the leaves are huge and have a bluish color making them really POP! also stays really small flowering at maturity which is only 3 feet tall.<br>  needle palm- a actual palm tree but will survive down to 0F an amazing temperature for a palm.<br>  azalea- many are very cold tollerant. they look nice if taken care of well.<br>  hydranea- not evergreen, but still a really nice shrub. a very cold tollerant plant, but wont flower if temperatures go below -25 except for some new cultivators.<br>  pointy ash- a really nice plant that has glossy leaves. cold tollerance to -40 and can stay small.|`|hWd50Lk8aa	Here are a few basic landscape tips.<br>  <br>  Never cover the windows with shrubs.<br>  Never frame a house with shrubs.<br>  Only prune your shrubs once or twice a year.<br>  Never top your trees.<br>  <br>  If you take that same picture and a few measurements to a garden center, they can give you some great ideas of what to plant, and usually do it for free.<br>  <br>  Lastly, figure out how much you can spend. Plan on at least $500 for plants and you can get something decent. That is with you providing all the back breaking work.<br>  <br>  Now go read a few landscape books, drink a beer, and relax.|`|m81dfyOYaa	No, I wouldn't remove them.  I'd trim them back and plant in front of them, daffodils, tulips, etc. for spring blooming, hosta, low growing perennials and some bright colored annuals. Flowers and green plants will give that area a whole new lease on life.|`|6n63DKYWaa	rip em out and put in nandinas|`|5IHnPYCoaa	No they are not ugly, Just overgrown. They look like either box woods, or Hollis, Can not really tell exactly though. If you want to pull them out and put something else there, You could replace them with more bushes that in the end will do exactly what you already have unless you trim them back. Or you could plant a nice flower garden, Annuals add color all spring and summer long, But you have to replant them every year. Perennials Add color during there blooming dates, But they do not supply color like the annuals. But a mix of both would be nice. It is all up to what you think you would like!<br>  Happy gardening|`|0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	No I wouldn't.  Many people forget that in a garden you need to have something to look at all year round.  If you pull out all the evergreens and replace them with annuals (and you enjoy lots of work), you have nothing as a back drop and nothing to look at in between growth and the area would be bare,<br>  <br>  This hedge looks like it has never been pruned properly.  Just grown to a height and 'topped'.  Trim about a third off the top and give a light prune to the sides and give it a good fertilize in spring.<br>  <br>  In front plant something that grows about a foot high (annuals if you like flowers), or a small variegated white/green shrub such as  euonymous if you just want an annual trim.  you could plant as a second layer something such as a minature nandina if your area gets cold enough to make it go red (you would have red winter colour).  If you wanted to extrend the bed outward you could have a lower level again and use something upright as you have.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with plants around a house it looks much better lawn to the house.  You wont find too many designed gardens with no plants near houses.  Check out some of the more expensive suburb gardens in your area.  They don't have one tree and a lawn.<br>  <br>  It's a shame you are pruning the tree in the lawn so hard.  If it is a small tree let it get a decent shape and you will get a silouette of branchs to look at in winter.  If it is a Crepe Myrtle, they don't prune them like this anymore they found it didn't increase flower production and it ruined the shape of the tree.<br>  <br>  My advice on the hedge prune and add to the garden bed.|`|AfnOU04paa	Yeah, they look pretty bad. This is from too many years of shearing them with a hedge trimmer.  They are too large and high for the house--makes it look creepy.  I prefer a natural look, and do all my pruning by hand to keep shrubs low and attractive.  I can't tell what these are, but could be Privet or Burning Bushes.  Both grow wildly fast, and can be pruned easily a couple times a year--very high maintenance.  <br>  <br>  I would take them out and start over, or at least take out every other one, and prune the others down.  Plant a lot of impatiens or petunias around them.|`|547Ln6rNaa	I like them. The only reason I took down the bushes outside my living room was that unfortunately, when they were in flower, they smelt like pee...bad choice for planting near the house huh? I guess the last owners didn't open the windows in summer.|`|OQeXXvaPaa	no, I don't think that they are ugly, if you use a hedge clipper/trimmer and cut them in the same angle as your house they may not seem so unattractive to you.|`|yNE7qzOhaa	Absolutely.

I would trim them down a bit. (Not too much or you will do damage)  Cut them back in fall and spring.  Give them a haircut from time to time.  I would plant bright annuals in front.  With a nice green background it would really make your house stand out.|`|1ea2fce4d3739447e5099457e500bd11aa	No -they are fine - just trim them a bit.

AA11634870	When you call companies: ask if they provide a free estimate, ask what the estimate is based on square footage, linear footage, time and material, one overall price. What you want is a line item breakdown based on cost. Do not accept any cost item based on distance from company to your location. You want a minimum of three estimates. Find out the crew size and what each person does. The time it takes to do project. Payment should be half down or percentage and the remaining balance upon project close-out. You want the boss or individual to walk through equipment run with you present to show efficiency. Also you get to know how your system works. Good luck
00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Depending on the type of electrical service  you have in your home there's a possibility that you may not have 220 volts of electric going to the dryer.  That's what it  takes to run the element, the timer problem, again depends on what cycle  you're trying to use.  If you're using the auto dry cycle, and not getting any heat, then it won't move until it senses a change in the humidity inside the dryer, if you're using a timed cycle, then the timer should move regardless.   You need to check the voltage at the recepticle and if it's right  then call the place you bought the dryer from.  They should have a service dept.|`|7289ff3941d4e2b2180956884c5d0733aa	You need to call the place you bought it. The manufacture warranties it for one year. Something is wrong with it.

When doing this pinpoint a couple of data points, so that you can get the lino cut in exactly the right place.

jcauTPLZaa	You cant get a firm answer on this question. There are way too many variables. Such as did he pull a permit to start with, what are you actually doing, ie; going from fuses to 200 amp panel. Does the meter base and feeders have to be changed out. Did he do everything up to code? Unless the electrician actually sees it NOBODY can say for sure. A decent price would be anywhere from $45.00 to $100.00 per hour depending on where you live. Plus a permit if needed, plus parts.|`|f36bb855b6fe4f58fc6b6148329e13a6aa	Wow, this is a big one. You need to have an electrician look at it, but there are state and local regulations which have to be followed. Plus if your state has adopted the IBC (international Building Code) and your home was done under the SBC (state building code) any electrician that comes in is required to bring the entire thing up to code. Not necessarily the whole house, but for sure everything he puts his fingers on. <br>  <br>  The other answer about the 45-100 per hour is about right, and it would easily be a full day for a 2,000 sq ft house.

Both are the product of too much moisture. Plants need to be where airflow can pass over them to dry out excess watering. You may need different pots so excess water can drain. Purchase a moisture meter to determine when watering is necessary.|`|t3Tc0NHAaa	Sounds like your plants have gotten too moist and have been in the right conditions to grow mold. In temperatures averaging around 55 degrees with little sun mold can eat away at your plants and stems and cause them to eventually  fall over with stem rot. You might want to try putting them some place where it is dry and let them dry out. vinegar and water mixed sprayed on soil after they dry out might kill the mold or else you might want to get some spray from the nursery that kills mold. If you have a plant that you really love you might want to re pot it in a new sterile container with new potting soil. <br>  Another thing that could have happened is the plant could have a mineral buildup from the manufacturer. If unsure take one to a nursery and ask them what it is.
fNuMoHt7aa	Luckily you don't need a chimney for gas fireplaces anymore. they make vent free model.. Do you have gas in your house already? <br>  <br>  It you are using propane it will be fairly cheap since the tank will be outside and the line is just run outside the house to where your fireplace would be and right through the wall. depending on how long the line has to be it shouldnt cost more that a couple hundred bucks. the biggest cost will be filling the propane tank and if  your provider makes you pay a deposit|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Gas fireplaces DO need a chimney since the outside air is provided through tubing along side the exhaust when installed.

Would blow everytime I started the motor.   That "spark" from turning it on is enough to kick the circuit.  I would bypass the system if it is possible....because the motor starts and stops and GFI senses that spark.IMO|`|v3xEtuLLaa	I would run a pigtail from the "line" side of the receptacle.  Check and see what the amp rating is on the circuit, however.  If it's a 20A circuit, you have to wire the skylight with 12 gauge wire.  If it's a 15A breaker, you are fine with 14 gauge.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  In the box where the GFCI is located, there are 2 sets of wires.  One set connects to the line side of the GFCI, one connects to the load side.  These are marked on the back of the receptacle.  Turn the breaker off, then remove the black and white from the line side.  Fish your new wires into the box and connect them to the black and white wires you just disconnected, along with a 6" black and a 6" white.  Wire nut the blacks together and the whites together.  Connect the grounds all together.  Connect the 2 short wires you just added to the line side of the GFCI, then reinstall the receptacle.  You then have a hot feed to the switch that is not GFCI protected.  Good luck.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	If the unit calls for a GFCI protected outlet, then you're good to go.<br>  If not, then I would suggest isolating the garage outlet, which would give you an unprotected line to the skylight, then just switch out the next standard outlet with another GFCI outlet to control the 4 "slaves."<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  If it doesn't call for a GFCI protected circuit, and you put it on one, it might just trip whenever you try to use it.<br>  woodtick's advice is perfect but I don't think you're tapping into the box where the GFCI outlet is located, are you?

WtqsWctjaa	Most experts will tell you that the best direction of laying laminate flooring is perpendicular to the longest floor joints. The reason for this is so you do not have any laminate floor planks running directly on top of a sub floor joint. If you end up with joints running on top of each other  some experts claim that your floor could flex and settle more with the home and give you high or low spots. However many people find the best direction of laying laminate flooring is so the flooring runs parallel to the sunlight coming into the room|`|bxlYleZkaa	In line with the longest side.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i would lay them the same way the longest part of the room goes. This will make the room look bigger, there will be less cutting and thus less waste.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	depends how unsquare it is. I would measure each wall at the corners to the opposite wall. see which way has the closest measurement. you dont want to come to your last row and have a angle cut every piece. if you dont have a choice make sure this wall will put under the couch or other furniture. you can lay it anyway you want it's not structural|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Any type of wood floor should be laid in the same direction exterior light enters the room. In other words, perpendicular to the window in the room. This minimizes the imperfections.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	You start and run the floor parallel to the longest straightest wall in the room.|`|yk7Qv1GZaa	Either direction will work, it's just a matter of preference. It the room is out of square (most are to some extent) you'll just have to rip the final run of planks at an angle. Don't worry, nobody will notice it.
YTyE8pTTaa	Being a cabinet maker / woodworker myself, I would say stick with the American-Made, "all-wood" construction!  But...<br>  <br>  As a Wood Scientist, I tend to have a prejudice against MDF, strictly because Solid Wood is, and always will be, higher quality.  However, MDF does not mean poor quality or bad cabinets, at all.  On the contrary!  The benefit of MDF cabinets is that we can utilize scrap wood and small-diameter wood to create beautiful structures.  So, it's much greener!  We're also not limited to size constraints and can produce pretty much any shape or size structure imaginable!  <br>  <br>  MDF can have a higher strength ratio than solid wood and is sure to be free of defects.  Just don't get it wet!<br>  <br>  To answer your question, Chinese cabinets are not bad.  Depending on the cabinet you're looking at, I would guess that they're going to use soft-woods or plywood with a hardwood veneer.  In this case, I would definitely recommend choosing MDF cabinets from the USA.  If you're paying for solid wood, but getting veneered pine or plywood, you're being robbed!
ZhN9hOaaaa	I would bite the bullet and change out the trap for starters. <br>  Then hope the drain down line from the trap is open.<br>  A plumber would be happy to power snake it for you but if the paints are tough, it might do damage to the pipes . Ask His opinion about the paints after you try a new trap. I wash my rollers and brushes in five gallon buckets first. Then in the utility sink after the bulk has been washed into the buckets. I use three buckets. Transferring to the cleanest last before I go to the sink.<br>  I leave the buckets and let the pigment settle to the bottom and slow pour off the top water and then trash the sediment the next day.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i would just replace the trap. the money you spent on liquid plumber would probably have paid for the trap. they are easy to fix and not that expensive.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	there is a product called save-a-brush that dissolves old paint, hardware or paint store. might be worth a try

Probably the best route  I would take it.  It happens  Hopefully it is not on a solder joint because the joint may be failing because of movement.      Go overboard on the application and do a big section(or area).  It will last long enough hopefully, so long as there is no more movement(but it is like winning the lottery) Chance of it happening?  Y & N|`|evItC2KQaa	The pin hole leak probably indicates that the pipe is corroded almost through. You can get a rubber patch that goes around the pipe and comes with two hose clamps to temp seal it but be careful not to over tighten as the pipe may collapse.remember this is a temporary fix only.|`|flkVehA9aa	You need a pipe repair clamp.  You can by them at most any hardware or plumbing supply.  They come in different sizes, so make sure you get the right one.  No need to turn the water off,  Just place the clamp over the leak and tighten up the screw.|`|GsSRY7quaa	you could try to solder the pipe. you will need a spool of non-lead solder and a torch. while the pipe is not leaking use the torch to heat up the pipe and apply the solder to fill the hole.|`|XzStbSPnaa	Go to the hardware store and get a piece of rubber and wrapp it around the pipe at least 1 1/2 time then put a hose clamp at the ends of the repair and it should get you by. A chunk or garden hose can work too. Is it copper, steel, Cast iron. The water can be shut off in the area of the water meter. going to the meter and out of the meter. This is really a repair that you can call a plumber and deduct it from your rent. I bet the land lord would really blow a gasket if you did that. Just make sure that it is not "BLACK PIPE" that is sewage. and it can be get you very sick, Especially if it's over your kitchen counter where you cook and eat. You need to shut off the water, drain the line, cut the pipe at the pinhole leak, get a connector of the same size, sandand flux then solder all the fittings with a pro[pane torch and turn the water back on and test for leaks, about 10 dollars in parts. get a local handy man to do it for $25.00 and be done with it
HHB9LUqiaa	as odd as this might sound my husband use to use shoe polish, a lighter, a cotton ball and a little dish of water.

I haven't worn anything that needed to be shined or polished in any way for so many years, I can't even count them.  However, in reading about bananas and the many things they can be  used for, I read that if you take the inside of a peeling and rub it on shoes that need to be shiny, it will do a great job of that.  I'm assuming that you'd need to buff with a clean dry fluffy cloth to obtain maximum gloss.|`|Qk1zkotwaa	Payless shoes makes an incredible shoe shinner. It comes in a case so it doesn't dry out.

CrsK0p1Yaa	Buy a case in bulk and plan on only buying another case 4 times a year on your budget. Stick with your budget. If you over use, and run out...use old magazines or newspaper to wipe. Thias will help encourage you to sparingly wipe. Wiping at other peoples homes will help as well. Try using public toilets more. Fun, fun!!|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	It all depends on how much toilet paper you use each time and also how often you're at home to use it.  (For example, if you're one of those people who is constantly out and about and does little more than sleep at home, you won't be using much toilet paper.) But really, the best, and only way, to know for sure, is to keep track of your habits now.  See how long it takes you to go through 4 rolls of toilet paper now while you're living at home (or wherever) and then when you move out, chances are that you'll use about the same amount.  However, if you are on a budget, might I recommend not buying Charmin Ultrasoft and opt for something cheaper.|`|Zr34uiwIaa	If this is not a joke, here is my answer.  If I were you, I would buy it in bulk - such as 12 double-rolls, from Target or other discount stores (such as Costco, Wal-Mart, etc.) when they are on sale.  I would buy more when I am down to 2 rolls.  The initial outlay of cash will be more than you are used to pay for 4-roll packs, but in the long run you will save.  You can get it for about 50 cents a roll.  Only you can figure out how often you will need to buy more, based on past experience.  It will depend on whether you are at home all the time, are the only one using it, etc.<br>  c|`|cc10a2e1e62ff5643d616568fcd73aacaa	I buy lots of rolls at once, it works out cheaper, and it won't go off!!   <br>  We used to run out, and this is tricky on sunday, or in the middle of the night when the shops are shut.

And your washer is either a Kenmore or Whirlpool direct drive.  This is actually a common problem, that many people have, but only those with a high drain hose ever realize.  Your neutral spin is not working.  If its under warranty or a maintenance contract, call your appliance people, you need a new transmission.  If its not, that's a pricey fix.  If you can put the washer somewhere where your drain-hose only has to go up to the height of the console, it will work just fine.  After the machine finishes agitating, its supposed to drain without spinning the basket, this is to allow the pump to achieve the RPM's necessary to lift the water 8 ft.  If your neutral spin is not working, it has to spin the basket full of water, while trying to pump and it cannot lift the water 8 ft in the time allotted.   It can do it if it only has to lift the water 4 ft.|`|L6kIV3Liaa	If it's old it just might be time to replace it. Try putting smaller loads in first, what your putting in now might be to heavy for the machine.|`|ZhN9hOaaaa	Observe the spin speed and time of spin.<br>  Is it as fast as your use to?

We used to have a huge ant problem in our house and after doing this for awhile, we got rid of the ants completely.  And of course the vinegar won't hurt your kids either.

944iJNAdaa	House demolition and wrecking is done generally by local enterprises on a small scale.  These people advertise house wrecking, demolition, or used building materials in the local phone books or newspapers.  Larger cities usually have permanent businesses that do this sort of thing; in rural areas it will be more informal.  And if you see someone tearing down something you think you could use the materials from, by all means stop by, they're probably for sale.

JNAyyZRMaa	Don't try painting the patterns on the wall, coz you're not 2 anymore. Okay... so stick with something simple, like the beach theme. Try to bend your theme with your room surroundings, like the windows and the shape. So, if your room is bright and sunny, choose the beach theme. First, paint the walls a really light color or just paint them white, which makes them brighter. I suggest painting a light blue stripe with a pattern ONLY on the edges of the stripe across the walls. Get some paintings in 3-D (you can get them at stores that are centered around home decor) with views of the ocean. Don't just stick them on a random wall though- if your room has angles and short stretches of blank walls, then put some there. Buy some normal paintings of landscapes which might make the room look a little bigger (coz it will look like there is a window there-sorta) and if you want your room to be more dynamic, choose simple paintings of diagnal lines that compliment pieces of furniture or the theme, this will make the room like more dynamic. Get dark blue curtains and buy those little chain things that can hang down with seashells on them. You can also buy one BIG piece of art and hang it on a blank stretch of wall, and buy smaller paintings on the other walls. Make the furniture a beach chair or one of those white deck chairs to sit on and maybe a life preserver to hang on the walls. Hope this helps!|`|vwYbFtkqaa	First pick your theme. asian/vintage or beach.  Try to keep it simple.  A nice paint color and some good accessories will make the room calm and inviting.

v3xEtuLLaa	There is a twisted side of me that wants to say the Yellow Pages, but I'll resist.  Black and Decker makes a series of books about various aspects of home improvement and repair that's pretty good.  Another option is to check community colleges in your area.  Often they give classes in basic plumbing, electrical, carpentry, etc.  You can also get to know your neighbors.  Many of them have skills, and might be willing to teach you.  The key is to know your limitations.  You may get some hands on plumbing experience, then feel you're ready to take on a bathroom remodel.  Ease into this.  Get yourself a good tool box, and start picking up tools as you need them.  It's a lot better to buy a good tool once than a cheap tool over and over.  Good luck to you.

They did make me laugh.  The 2 of you definitely spoke the truth.  Cindy, do you want to be treated like an adult?  If you do, be honest with your parents and tell them exactly what you have plan or are going to do.  But if you get caught lying and sneaking around this will tell your parents that you are not responsible and should be treated according to your actions.<br>  Most teenager girls have or are going through exactly what you are going through.  This is just a temporary phase of growing up that you are going through.  Things will get better.  Moving out will not solve the issues that you are having at home.  You are still young.  Talk to your parents about the issues that you are having with them and maybe the 3 of you can work out a compromise that will make them and yourself happy.  The best years of school is in high school.  Don't cheat yourself out of it because you want to move out.  You will regret it later in life even though you may not realize it now.  Be an adult and talk to your parents.  Good Luck!!

Another option is to cut off the circuit breaker that's attached to that particular outlet, if the room is seldom used or if the breaker only controls a few circuits in the room. The only other option that I can think of is to have an electrician first cut the power to the room, then manually remove the outlet, then cap the wires with wire-nuts, and then cover the hole with a blank cover. As you can see, these options range from easiest to most expensive. Haha.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi, I use this on white clothes only.<br>  Stubborn stains on material often resists ordinary washing. Use this solution to get rid of it.

Wash the fabric in warm soapy water, then mix salt and lemon juice, enough to cover the area, and apply it.<br>  2. Place the article in full sun, rinsing it after several hours. If the stain persists, repeat.<br>  <br>  Also for Natural Stain Stoppers.<br>  Blood, chocolate, or Coffee. Soak soiled article overnight in a solution of 1/4 cup borax and 2 cups cold water.

Baking soda and vinneger can clear sink drains, and cut up lemons can freshen garbage desposals.<br>  But peroxide can remove blood and some other stains from fabric (and pre-treat deep stains in carpets) then you just pre-wash the item by hand with detergent and throw it your regular wash).<br>  Also there's a product called Natures Miracle (originally made to take skunk smell out of anything! Found out about this by our vet after our dog was sprayed), but it can take out baby vomit, poop, and a few other stains.<br>  I'm sure that if you look online, and be more specific about the type of stain, you will find your answer.|`|NSUKbea2aa	1. My number one rule: Give your product time to work. Rubbing alcohol removes ink off most surfaces but not the minute you blot it on. Dab on your cleaner then allow a 30 minute wait. This gives the product time to dissolve the residue eliminating all the rubbing and scrubbing.<br>  <br>  2. Always get to a spill immediately. The longer a spill sets the worse the stain.<br>  <br>  3. Rinse the cleaner out of fabrics especially carpets with one-quarter cup white vinegar in two cups of water. Then repeat with plain water.<br>  <br>  4. Blotting properly prevents fraying of fabric. Blot using a damp towel.Form a knuckle with your index finger and push into the towel. Rock you finger back and forth, move the towel then rock your finger left to right. Repeat. Reapply the cleaner if needed. After the second application of cleaner, again make a knuckle with your index finger. Push your knuckle and the towel into the carpet then twist your wrist clockwise. Carpet fibers are twisted clockwise. This removes the stain from between the fibers without leaving them fuzzy.<br>  <br>  5. Use heat of any kind even hot water. Heat sets stains. Dryer heat particularly means certain death for easy removal.<br>  <br>  6. Put a clean rag under the fabric you are working on to prevent the stain from spreading to another surface.

This will work well, but if it is a high traffic walking area you should use a concrete mortar, as it is a bit more permanent.<br>  <br>  As far as a coating is concerned, there are many products that you can apply to stone to accomplish a number of things: bringing out the natural color of the stone, making the stone appear "wet", or cleaning and sealing.<br>  <br>  All of the products mentioned above can be purchased at a landscape or construction materials store.|`|azypqsphaa	set them in epoxy cement|`|Tvcn83Adaa	I do not know of anything that can be sprayed on.<br>  <br>  Most of the finishes you are thinking of are a decorative finish to concrete.  You pour the concrete and right before is is set, you press the stones into the top.  There is a little more involved in that, but you get the picture.

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	try bleeding the system like you would car brakes....turn on the water.  There should be a valve located on each sprinkler head that lets you open up to get water flowing out.  Start with the one closest to the water source and finish with the one farthest from the water source.  This process will push the air out towards the last head and bleed all the air out.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	If you bleed the system and you still have hammering call in at a plumbing shop and get a pipe anti hammering device (yes they do make them, not joking (commonly used on washing machine outlets).<br>  <br>  They may solve your problem.|`|d74258384cd97c49b6386745a7a49380aa	You may need to do all of the above, and more.  If the pounding sound is coming from the pipes in the house, then it would be worth a try to bleed the air out of those pipes as well.<br>  <br>  But let’s look at your irrigation valves.  Many people have solved their water hammer problems by switching out their “more economical” valves for others that are a bit more professional.  For example, if you have Orbit valves you might solve your headaches by going to Rain Bird DVFs.<br>  <br>  And here is something that you should try, that is if your valves have flow controls on them.  The flow control adjusts the amount of water flowing through the valve, usually in the middle of the valve; not to be confused with the valve’s bleed screw.  With the “noisy valve” activated and water flowing through it, close the flow control (clockwise) until the water stops, then open the flow control back up to a point a little past where the water begins to flow.  This often fixes water hammer problems.  By the way, valves like to operate within certain pressure ranges and can misbehave if they don’t get what they want.<br>  <br>  Also, the speed of the water flowing through pipes can cause problems.  Even with normal water pressure, smaller diameter pipes can create flow rates above what are recommended, resulting in water hammer.  Water hammer arrestors, as they are called, can help.  Some people make their own version by “Teeing” into the water line to a toilet a capped off stub of ?” tubing of about 24” in length.  The stub sticks up behind the toilet reservoir and has trapped air in it, making it act like a shock absorber.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

4z0Rk4Ddaa	Any cleaning product used on hardwoods should have a neutral pH, and one specifically formulated for wood floors is the best choice. Follow the instructions on the cleaning label, use a soft mop, and apply the cleaner/water solution sparingly. If after cleaning the wood floors feel sticky or like there is a residue, use a vinegar rinse with ? cup white or cider vinegar to 1 gallon of water. Mopping with regular detergents or any cleaner with ammonia can strip the finish of the floors, so carefully read labels before applying any cleaner to your hardwood floors. Floors with a wax finish (most new floors and many older do not require this because they have a polyurethane coating) will require buffing approximately twice a year; follow manufacturer recommendations on waxing and buffing. If you happen to find a spot of floor with a stain, clean with your chosen wood cleaner, rinse with the vinegar solution, and then dry with a clean towel. Rub fine-grain sand paper along the wood (following the grain) until the stain is no longer apparent. Buff with a cloth, and then apply wax or finish to protect the area.<br>  If you go to Menards, Lowes, Home Depot they can recommend something that would be best for your floors.  Below are 2 sites you may find interesting.|`|cZrbAiUIaa	Swiffer works good.

qT7bVDRiaa	Undiluted bleach on any color will bleach it right out. The amount of bleach (1/2c. for reg washers, a capful for He washers) used in washers doesn't harm colors that have already faded. (Clothes that have really been washed). My mom used to use bleach on all of her dish towels whether colored or not. The colors didn't bleed if it was an old towel. If it's something you don't want ruined though-don't use the bleach. 10 parts water to one part bleach for general cleaning and disinfecting. You can find the ratios for different types of uses on the bottles, too,.|`|N1isny2oaa	For Laundry just follow the directions on the containers but for germs on desk top counters for viruses one part bleach ten parts water.<br>  <br>  Smooches <br>  <br>  WonderWoman

When we are starting seeds here at the nursery for spring vegetable plants we start them on a heated table with the thermostat set at 78 degrees, and air temperature of 68 degrees.

If you're<br>  working with Solanaceous plants (i.e., tomatoes, chiles, eggplants,<br>  etc.), you'll need warmer soil.

Jzr8UmFKaa	The best is in the fall but you can reseed in the spring also.  Just let the grass grow to about a foot tall before you cut it for first time and cut it high|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Spring or Fall.  In many parts of the country (usa) you can grow cool-season grasses NOW with success.  In fact, due to our water shortage, it is a good idae to allow the rains to water in seed and keep it moist- instead of your irrigation system.  <br>  I'm reseeding (and growing) perennial ryegrass right now (feb) and also fertilizing my grasses (bent, rye, poa) without using ANY water!  The idea is to have a healthy grass going into the warmer,drier months.  A healthier plant can withstand drought much more effectively.  Also, don't forget about applying ample P (Potassium) as its presence within the plant (and root) will assist in a plants ability to withstand droughty conditions and incidence of disease.|`|fEvEPJjEaa	In the spring after the temperature remains above 60 degrees has always worked well for me. Just loosen the area you want reseeded with a garden rake or whatever is at your disposal , throw out the seed , tamp the area down a bit, keep it moist until the seed germinate , them water every 3 or 4 days until you get a good healthy stand. The seed bag should tell you when to mow , varieties of grass differ. A good started fertilize probably would be a good idea also.
