20090203131812AA2Tvrp	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Shallow draft yard well - out of water?	I have a small standard, common,  shallow-draft, yard irrigation well with a fairly new 3/4hp centrifuge pump. Our ground water level is usually about 12-14 feet down. I primed it, the pump started, built pressure appropriately, and shut off correctly at 50pounds pressure.      When I then turn the (outflow) garden hose on, once I run out the built up water, I get nothing but a pee-stream within less than a minute.....shut water demand off, pressure builds to 50#, pump shuts off....and, darn it, repeat....      Does not seem to be blowing out air bubbles or such with the water, and the sound of the pump running seems normal. But, does not hold a prime, either, even for a short time.       This is the first property I've lived on that actually had a well, I'd always had an at-the-surface weir box to pump from previously.      Now for the incredibly stupid question you have been waiting for: How do I know the difference between the well being out of water (not recharging the groundwater quickly enough) or a pump issue?      No problem when I shut down last fall, and everything was drained.

20070608133047AAm7xlO	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Backyard Landscape Cost?	I've been working on my parents backyard. It is about 60 feet by 35, and I was wondering what you guys thought I should ask from them. Just to give you an idea of what I have been and will be doing. First, I took down the fence that was surrounding the property. I cut the boards and roped them together for bulk pick up. The lawn was filled with overgrown grass and weeds. I weed wacked it and took a rototiller to get all the grass up. The yard is now bare of any grass. My next project is to flaten the dirt and place top soil on it. Then plant the seed and all the other stuff I need to do to get grass to grow. What do you think is a fair price, and how much do you think a contractor would charge my parents? Thanks.

I installed the new low-level mercury energy efficient bulbs throughout our house. One of the kids broke one by throwing a ball and hitting it. I didn't know at the time how to properly clean it up. And quite stupidly, I picked up the pieces (no gloves on) and vaccumed the rest - which are apparently two big things you should never do. I also did not ventilate the room. I am worried because the kids (all under 6) were in the room at the time and it isn't well ventilated. Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do now? I know mercury is a neurotoxin, but was there enough in one bulb to hurt the kids?

20080207200005AAxoROT	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Is is wise to replace an oil furnace with heat pump or gas?	I live in VA in a 40 year old 1300 sq ft house with an oil furnace for heat. My furnace is good, 3-4 years old, located in the garage. However the unit outside (used for the central A/C) is as old as the house. I want to replace that with a new larger energy-efficient model, and I would like input on whether I should redo the whole system or just replace the outside unit. I think a heat pump uses the outside unit to exchange heat, so if I went that way I would have to do it when I replaced the unit outside, right? I also don't like paying a seperate oil bill ($150 every month). Would having an entirely electric system have an effect on my electric bill summer vs. winter? I have an electric tankless water heater. Nothing in the house is gas, so I would have to get it piped in. The oil tank is on a stand in the back yard, right outside my bedroom window, which I'm not too fond of.

20081209111827AAldLEh	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Why are propane prices different for every customer in the same area?	My Propane company (Ferrell Gas) charged me in October $2.73/gal, and my price is capped to $2.849, so it can't get higher than that, well,    I have 3 - 100gal. tanks, and they run out every 2 months, so I have ro refill twice per season. In December of this year they charged me $2.849/gal, that's the ceiling price(they say that the actual cost per gallon for me is $2.99, but another lady from the same company gave me a price of $3.099, 20 mins. before the 2nd lady. The propane on the market in my area sells for $2.40/gal in December, but they deny those prices, and say that every company charges diff. price based on the usage of propane for each household. So if I use 600gals. of propane per season, and my neighbor uses less, he gets a better price. Are they allowed to do that, or am I getting ripped off? If the prices of propane are dropping, shouldn't I get a lower bill than 2 months ago?

20081013074803AATOJKP	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does water run by itself for a few seconds?	I have a 1950's ranch, new toilets and faucets, hot air heat, newer copper plumbing. We have noticed that 2-3 times a day, we can hear water "running" (through the system, not out a faucet) for 5-10 seconds and then it stops. Is this normal or a problem? We can't tell exactly where it comes from because it happens so fast. Any ideas? Thank you.

20081216062638AAxpIks	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to wire an extra light and switch ?	I built a closet  in my bedroom and I want to install a light inside. ( I know the code requirements for a light in a closet it has to be florence or have a cover over the bulb and also required distance from the shelves clothing etc.)       I want to make sure I get the a wiring part right, I think I'm right about this but correct me if I'm wrong.       This is an older home and its has been rewired and brought up to code with gfci on all bedrooms and wired smoke detectors for required rooms.    The wiring was placed on the outside walls inside metal tracking (wiremold).    Inside the tracking there are 3 wires black, white and green (size 14 I think).   Can I  connect into the existing wiring using a junction box and run the black wire to the switch box where it is cut and each end will be connected to the two seperated post on the light switch then continued  to the light fixture where it is also connected.   .    The white wire should continue from the junction box to the switch box where it is cut and wire nutted together then continued to the light fixture.      The green wire will do the same as the white wire but I know this is the grounding wire. Will it have to be connect to the light switch or continue to the light fixture and be grounded there?   (I know all metal boxes have to be grounded, but I using plastic boxes for the switch.       I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say and correct me if I'm wrong.....Thanks
