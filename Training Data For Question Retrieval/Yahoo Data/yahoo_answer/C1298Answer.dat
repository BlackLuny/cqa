BhumxInEaa	1. From the total mass and the total volume you can compute the mass per unit volume.<br>  <br>  2. From the mass per unit volume and the mass per atom (from the periodic table and Avogadro's constant) you can compute the number of atoms per unit volume.<br>  <br>  3. From number of atoms per unit volume you get the volume per atom.<br>  <br>  4. The relationship between the space the atom takes up and its diameter varies with the physical structure of the material:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_packing_factor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_pack...</a><br>  If we assume that the material is a simple cubic crystal, then each atom is in its own little cube and the side of this little cube is exactly the diameter of the atom.<br>  <br>  So if V is the volume taken up by the atom in a simple cubic lattice, then cube root(V) is the diameter of the atom.<br>  <br>  While this isn't accurate for other lattice configurations, it is pretty close (with a factor of 2) and so is a good approximation.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you know the kind of crystal, then you can do better.

cm4oW9lZaa	A low pressure center is a region of rising air. The rising air cools by isentropic expansion, which causes the water vapor to condense, forming clouds. The latent heat release from the condensing water vapor strengthens the vertical motion, lowering the surface pressure, drawing more moist air into the low, resulting in more condensation ... you get the picture.<br>  <br>  (Easier answer) Low pressure areas exist because air is rising, leaving less pressure behind. When it rises, it reaches its level of saturation. Water condenses, forming a cloud.|`|qozdiWpIaa	Low pressure centres can be recognized as LPA (Low Pressure Areas), WMLPA (Well Marked LPA), D (Depressions), DD (Deep Depressions), CS (Cyclonic Storms), SCS (Severe CS), and Hurricanes or Super Cyclones depending on their strength and vastness and distructive natures. <br>  (1) Normally if an odd or even isobar can be located on a weather map we can say it is a LPA ( Low Pressure Area) which may be thousads of sq. miles even. Wind travel anti-clockwise  in Northern Hemisphere around a low pressure centre. and clockwise in Southern Hemisphere.<br>  This rotationally travelling wind circulation around low pressure centre is called cyclonic circulation. When a cyclonic circulation occurs wind gets vertical component to rise up whereby the moisture contained in the air condences to form clouds of different natures. If the moisture content is large rain bearing clouds and thunderclouds develop about the inside of cyclonic circulations causing weather activities around the Low Pressure System/ Centre. Rain and thunder shall increase according to the strength of Pressure Gradient in the cyclonic circulating System around the low pressure centre. According to the Pressure gradient wind  increases and as the wind increases vertical DEVELOPMENT OF WEATHER CLOUDS INCREASE. If the system is over Sea / ocean area availability of moisture shall be more and conducive nature increases and LPA might  become a WMLPA, or D, or DD, or CS, or SCS, or Hurricane depending upon wind structure  and pressure gradient.<br>  (2) If Two Concentric isobars of  2 to 3 hPa difference we3 can say the Low pressure centre constitutes a WMLPA ( Well marked LPA) where winds may of the order of 5 to 17 knots. It occrs occassional to continuous rain and thunder activity over that area.<br>  (3) If the closed isobars have differnce of more than 4hPa upto 6hPa<br>  with winds 17 to 30 knots we can classify that low pressure centre to be a D or Depression whose cntre can be defined on a weather map specifically. These area will have widespread weather activity of rain and thunder and winds. Distructionsshall not be much. Satellite organised clouds of T 1.5 to 2.0<br>  (4) If there are three closed isobars of  6hPa and winds of 30 to 33 knots we say it is a DD (Deep Depression). This accompanies strong weather activity with strong winds affecting normal life but distructions shall not be much. Cloud coverrage will be much larger in and around the depression field. Satellite classification upto T2.5<br>  ( 5) When pressure gradient is such there are 4 or mor closed isobars with central pressure 7hPa or more from the outer pressure and the winds circulation of the order of 33 knots or more we classify the system Cyclonic Strom (CS) and satellite cloudiness scales of T3.0 or more. The DISTRUCTIVE NATURE OF THE WEATHER SYSTEM INCREASES. Gale winds blow causing distruction to sea navigation and air navigation and widespread weather of rain and thunder, floods and enundation sea and river shores and low lying areas affecting human life much.<br>  (6) Severe Cyclonic Storm (SCS) or very severe CS etc. are classifiesd according to T number of satellite picture, windspeeds recorded or calculated and due the pressure gradients. T4.0 and above<br>  wind speeds more than 60 knots to even 100 knots. Weather affects thousands of miles around the system.<br>  (7) T- numbers more than 5.0 with winds over 100 knots or more with central pressure severe falls (say 20 hPa to hundreds of hPa) are classified as Hurricanes of Super Cyclones. These are catastrophic distructive systems with weather activity affecting the whole continent and much of global area around the system. Rain and Thunder and high winds are the most common affair in these areas alng with much loss of life and structures and all sorts of damages. <br>    These distructive systems area much unwanted by man. but can not avoid. On prayerfully dealing things life can be saved by the Grace and Mercy of God if men cooperate on love and harmony.|`|M5mO0Qtnaa	low pressure forms from the ground up and therefore the air around the low pressure system would become unstable and cooler than the environment around it allowing clouds to form and rise.

BDKqYOSraa	When standing from laying down, the blood drops toward the lowest point in your body resulting in a drop in blood pressure.<br>  The "autopilots" of your brain (hypothalamus, carotid sinus node) sense the drop in pressure and activate your autonomic nervous system (ANS).<br>  <br>  In a healthy person, the ANS automatically compensates in three ways. 1) It increases your HR 2) increases the strength of your heart beats (contractility)  3) causes the blood vessels in your legs to contract. <br>  The ANS response causes blood pressure to return to normal, usually in less than a minute. When pressure is normalized again, the HR returns to normal.<br>  <br>  If a person continues to have low blood pressure despite an increased HR after position change, we call it "orthostatic hypotension".<br>  This is pathological (abnormal) and may be a sign of an underlying cardiovascular condition or drug side effect.|`|SG2UCUmpaa	It's basic physics. Lying down, the blood can easily return to your heart since your body is flat. The increased volume of blood returning to your heart means that your heart does not have to beat as fast or as hard to pump it around your body and the pressure also drops. When you sit up or stand up, the effect of gravity on your body prevents the return of blood from the bottom of your body to your heart. As a result, your heart compensates by beating harder and faster to increase the blood flow around the body and your blood vessels clamp down to increase the pressure so that the blood will flow to the organs. Hope this helps!

AA12139405	Read the real story.<br>  It was about 6.30 am when the telephone bell rang. It was a call from Mr. R. Murugaiyan,( Ph- +914426162636 )  retired executive engineer from Tamilnadu electricity board. He asked me, if my earthquake instrument sensed any warning. I said that “No, however; I will adjust the sensitivity and see”. He said that he could see cups & saucers moving on the table. Around the same time, my daughter-in-law came from the second floor and said that she felt her cot shake. I was adjusting the sensitivity of my instrument fixed in my hall. Again another phone call from Mr. Gopal (Ph +919884062661) a former project engineer of M/s Enfield, India; from Annanagar. He said he was able to see water in the bubble top water filter shaking peculiarly. Most of my friends used to call me to get the clarifications on earthquakes. I replied “I am adjusting the sensitivity of my instrument, I will contact you later”.<br>   <br>  My instrument then started sensing the waves and it raised an alarm sound. But there was no ground motion felt by us. As, there was no ground shaking I have disconnected the sounding device and I was observing the flickering of the light in the quake alarm. Since, the frequency of the earthquake (0.5 to 15 Hz) is lower than the capacity of our vision I was able to see the flickering of the bulb. Although, I have 4 early warning instruments in my house (two imported from U.S.A. and the other two were designed by me), only my latest simplified design was adjusted to sense the earthquake on that day. <br>   <br>  The warning signal stopped at about 6.42 A.M I.S.T. So the total warning time was 12 minutes. I never heard in the history of earthquake that the signal lasted for 12 minutes. Generally, earthquake produces shakings for a few seconds to one or two minutes only. The earthquake shakings sensed by my quake alarm for 12 minutes is very high. I was upset for a few minutes. I just thought of the concept of Richter scale. If the amplitude of shaking is low and the time of sensing was for very long time it is also equal in magnitude if the amplitude is high and the shaking is for shorter time. Therefore, I came to a conclusion that the magnitude of the earthquake sensed by my instrument is very high and should be from far away distance. As my eye was operated, I was unable to move out of my house.<br>   <br>   Mr Chandrasekar from Ambattur ( +919884032977 )called me over phone and asked about its effect. I explained him that the sea water may rise to a great height. I brought the Xerox copies of earthquake behaviours from USA library. In the book named “why earthquakes” written by Mr Bruce Bolt, it was clearly mentioned what should be and should not be done before, during and after earthquake. It reads like this “Stay away from beaches and waterfront areas where Tsunami could strike even long after the shaking has stopped”. That day was also full moon day. The seismic activities will be more on that day. Therefore I informed the door darshan and to Sun T.V. to broadcast the alert message at 6.45 a.m. itself. One Mr. Chellappa attended the call at Door darshan T V station. He has asked me to bring the instrument to prove my claim. I explained to him my inability to move from the house. He ignored my warning.<br>   <br>  In Sun T.V. my call was redirected to Sun news section. I explained about my past history and I told them that I have appeared in Sun T.V. for four times and I have appeared on T.V. of other countries like Singapore and London to explain about my instrument of warning systems. But they also ignored my warning. At last the disaster took place at around 8.45 a.m. If the use of my quake alarm was properly tested and certified by the nodal agency my warning would have received its due merit.<br>   <br>  People were unaware of the changes that took place before the earthquake that is barking of police dogs as reported by the Chennai police department; the water receded in the sea shore before the Tsunami attack at Kanniyakumari. Water in small tanks and ponds near Nagappattanam spilled out and the water became muddy.

This would not have been nearly such a big deal if it hadn't been for the History Channel and its unconscionable programming decision to air that abysmal documentary -- not once, but several times.<br>  <br>  Nothing that has been rumored about some disaster or the end of the world in 2012 is true. There will be no galactic "alignment." The sun appears to cross the galactic equator on December 21, EVERY year and it does not, and will not, cross the galactic center. And even if it did, there would be absolutely no effect from it.<br>  <br>  The Mayans did not predict or imply the end of the world. And even if they did, so what? Various people or groups claiming some special insight have predicted the end of the world numerous times, just within my own lifetime and we're all still here. Some claim this was predicted by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Aztecs, the I Ching, etc., and every one of those claims is bogus. No, I don't just mean the predictions are wrong; I mean those people never even MADE any such predictions. Again, this is the result of liars and frauds who post things to the Internet or who manage to write a book or get their faces in front of a camera. Some television networks will air anything they think will get more viewers to see their commercials. It's all about making money from their sponsors.<br>  <br>  Other claims people make are equally bogus. There is NO planet Nibiru. The earth's magnetic poles will NOT flip in one particular day -- or year -- or century. That process takes thousands of years. And the earth's axial poles, don't EVER flip. People who talk about this Planet X are equally ill-informed and need to learn which sources of information are reliable. There is no such planet. That hypothesis was ruled out over a decade ago. If such a long term planet existed and it was due to be close to us in 2012, it would be inside the orbit of Saturn by now. Astronomers everywhere, even amateurs, would know about it. But there isn't a single one who claims the existence of this object. Again, this comes from people who post to the Internet without having a clue what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  There is NO computer program which can predict the end of the world and the creep who says he wrote such a program is also a liar and a fraud. And no, none of these claimed sources ever predicted 9-11 like their advocates say they did.<br>  <br>  There is no cyclical event which is due to recur in 2012, except for a solar maximum. These happen about every 11 years and there is no reason to believe this upcoming one will be any more harmful than any of the previous ones.<br>  <br>  This bunk is being pushed by unprincipled people looking for a profit, (like the History Channel), or out to scare kids or terrorize people back into church, (like St. Birgitta, on Youtube.)<br>  <br>  I can't imagine what kind of preparation there would be, but this isn't going to happen anyway.

There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same.

HxXduL1maa	The Namib Desert is a desert in Namibia and southwest Angola which forms part of the Namib-Naukluft National Park. The name "Namib" is of Nama origin.<br>  The desert occupies an area of around 80 900 km2 (31 200 square miles), stretching about 1000 miles (1,600 km) along the Atlantic Ocean coast of Namibia. Its east-west width varies from 30 to 100 miles (50-160 km). The Namib Desert also reaches into southwest Angola. It is one of the 500 distinct physiographic provinces of the South African Platform physiographic division.<br>  The area is considered to be one of the oldest deserts in the world, having endured arid or semi-arid conditions for at least 55 million years after the Atacama Desert. Its aridity is caused by the descent of dry air of the Hadley Cell, cooled by the cold Benguela current along the coast. It has less than 10 mm (0.4 inches) of rain annually and is almost completely barren.|`|KHSOVxViaa	The Namib.<br>  <br>  Nope, not the Kalahari, that's well inland ;-)|`|wgDHR9h5aa	The Namib Desert|`|esOaJoqBaa	Namib, and or Kalahari.

The environment would probly cause us to adapt differently, like if we grew up in a place with 4 foot ceilings we might crawl and develop a more 4 legged mode of transportation. Over time though, the species evolves according to environment. For example, the Mayans were very short people with short strong legs because they lived in an environment where that trait is most useful. Evolution is obviously far more complex than that but hey....|`|vgHnnTxNaa	Yes and no. In your example, no.<br>  <br>  Yes in the fact people (before culture played a role... i.e. clothing & AC) develop to fit their environment.

bc274120b758d96cbb6bdd3609819262aa	In prophase I the chromosomes become visible. However, unlike prophase of mitosis, the two chromosomes combine or synapse to form tetrads. Tetrads are also known as bivalents because they contain two pairs of chromosomes. At this point the chromosomes cross over at points called chiasmata. Crossing over allows the chromosomes to exchange genetic material, allowing for more different combinations of genetic material. As in the prophase of mitosis the nuclear envelope disperses, the spindle moves into the center, and the tetrads become connected to the spindle fibers by kinetochores.

9Wi2eNInaa	If your teacher marked the compound as S2O3 and didn't put a charge on it and said , " what is S2O3 ?" , then she is asking you for the compound name which would be  disulfur trioxide. The trouble is no such compound really exists, I mean you can't order that compound from a store, you can only get the ion in a solution.<br>  <br>  If she would of put ,"what is S2O3 (-2) ?" . By placing a charge on the compound you automatically know it's an ion. So you were kind of tricked on that one<br>  <br>  You are completely right that thiosulfate is an ion and it is S2O3 (-2) charge, but if you leave the charge off of it , technically you can't call it an ion.<br>  <br>  It's like if you dissolve salt in water and get Na+ ions and Cl- ions. If your teacher asked you,  "what is Na ? ", You would have to call it sodium metal, or monosodium ,not sodium ion. But if she said, "what is Na+?", then you say sodium ion<br>  <br>  Lead (II)sulfate , is a compound, is a powder, and is real. but if you dissolve it it dissociates into ions of Pb (+2) and sulphate SO4 (-2). But if your teacher asks you what is SO4?, Do  not say sulphate ion, you have to say Sulfur Tetraoxide. Even though in real life there is no such compound|`|pSOQTumdaa	all of these compounds are ionic compounds.  naming ionic compounds you name the metal first and then the cation.  <br>  galium and nitrite = galium nitrite<br>  aluminum and cyanide = alluminum cyanide<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  S2O3^-2 is the thiosulfate ion and has a charge of -2<br>  S2O3 is disulfur trioxide<br>  if there is no charge after the compound, it is not an ion<br>  Pb(SO4)2 is lead 4 sulfate<br>  if it were lead 2 sulfate then you would see PbSO4 with no subscripted numbers.  you were correct in your naming.  teh charges are seen when the compound (theortically) dissociates.  lead II sulfate doesn't dissociate too well but you'd be left with Pb+2 and SO4-2.  ask your teacher to explain her reasoning and i'm sure you will come to a better understanding of what he/she is telling you.|`|dQfSmBmeaa	Gallium nitrite<br>  Aluminium cyanide<br>  Aluminium sulphide<br>  Iron bromide<br>  Aluminium cyanide<br>  Silver Bromide<br>  <br>  Thiosulphate is an ion whereas disulphur trioxide is not ionic, a charge must be shown in order for it to be ionic state.<br>  <br>  In a molecule that contains a balanced anion and cation no charge will be shown as there is no overall charge.|`|ebea0b7eca17a9c14bcc8620e40b3913aa	An ion has the charge shown when it is self standing, such as the thiosulfate S2Os with a -2 charge. When the ion is part of a compound, the charges are not shown as the compound is overall neutral. In the case of Lead (11) sulfate, the Pb has a +2 charge and the SO4 has a 2- charge. So together, there is no charge.<br>  <br>  In naming a compound, the cation is always first with the full name of the element followed by the charge (if there are multiple possibilities) and then the anion.<br>  <br>  So the first 2 you have are gallium nitrite and aluminum cyanide.<br>  <br>  In covalent molecules you use the greek prefixes, such as disulfur trioxide (as a molecule and not as an ion.)

P4cvrMxgaa	Grapefruit contains a chemical (bergamottin) that is a strong inhibitor of the enzyme that metabolizes lovastatin (and all other statins, except for pravastatin).  This means there is less statin metabolized and therefore more in your bloodstream.  Unfortunately, the effects of bergamottin on an individual's metabolism are unpredictable so a doctor or pharmacist cannot tell how they will respond or adjust dosage.  What this means is you cannot have grapefruit juice while taking any statin (other than pravastatin).  If it is any consolation, bergamottin is not present in orange juice, so you can try substituting OJ or other citrus fruits for grapefruits.  I'm sorry, because I love grapefruits as well!|`|bb6c78841a66fa6fd2cda6b92f169815aa	The pharmacist says  grapefruit is a  "potentator", it makes the lovastatin stronger but she said at a fairly low dose ( 40 mg ) a half grapefruit  now and then would be ok. I would check with your doctor or pharmacist and get their recommendation.|`|1R1tYAbPaa	Grapefruit affects the way your body gets rid of the lovastatin. It can increase the amount of the drug in your body which can lead to adverse drug effects. <br>  Its best if you do not have any grapefruit at all with lovastatin. If you have to absolutely eat grapefruit, talk to your doctor about changing to pravastatin. Grapefruit has no effect on that drug.

OAKuDqXXaa	The kinetic molecular theory for gases says that the molecules are in continuous straight line motion and that their kinetic energy is greater than the attractive forces between them.  So they move freely and independent of each other, and they are much further apart than a solid or liquid.  It also says that there is no energy loss when a molecule collides with another molecule or the side of a container.  This explains everything in your list.<br>  <br>  Expansion: The molecules are moving in continuous straight lines.  So they will continue in one direction until colliding with something, meaning they will fill whatever container they are in.<br>  <br>  Fluidity: Fluidity is the ability to flow, or move from one place to another.  Since gases are in constant motion, and the molecules are independent of each other, the gas is able to flow.<br>  <br>  Low Density: The molecules are much further apart than with a solid or liquid.  So per unit of volume there is very little amount gas, as compared to a liquid or solid.  Density is mass over volume.<br>  <br>  Compressionability: Is this even a word? Gases can be compressed because there is so much space between molecules.<br>  <br>  Diffusion: Diffusion is movement from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.  Gases are in constant motion, so it follows that if you have an area of high concentration, the gas will move to the area of low concentration.  You can see this work when you open a container of compressed gas.  If diffusion didn't exist, then the compressed gas would just stay in the container.|`|pSOQTumdaa	all of these things are affected and determined by the kinetic molecular theory because they all have to do with the fact that gases are made up of tiny molecules that have perfectly elastic collisions and can be compressed.  think of what makes a gas a gas and you can figure these out on your own.

The Bible states that no man knows when the time will be.|`|HxXduL1maa	ONLY NOSTRADAMUS BELEAVES IN IT!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Its hard to understand how there can be new predictions coming from a man who has been dead almost 500 years. Its a little disconcerting in light of the fact that several independent ancient sources have predicted the world will end on December 21, 2012. Now we can add Nostradamus to the list of predictions for that date. In fact, he notes that the odds of these various groups predicting the same events for the same date could not be mere coincidence.<br>  I realize that we’ve had many warnings of the end of the world before. We all remember cults that have sat and waited for space ships to come pick them up before destroying the Earth, or committing mass suicide in preparation for the apocalypse. Then there was all the dire warnings about Y2K. They say that happens at every turn of a millennium, although I don’t know how anyone would know that. All of these stories make any of these prophesies a little hard to get too excited about.<br>  Still, one keeps coming back to the words of Nostradamus. Can it be a coincidence when different civilizations on different continents in different times came up with the same date? Its not like they could text each other or read it on the internet. They came up with the predictions of doom and gloom in 2012 complete independently of one another.<br>  I think I’ll plan a big party for December 22, 2012, the day after Winter Solstice 2012. If we are still around then, it’ll be a big celebration. If not, then it won’t really make any difference.<br>  the future cannot really be predicted. with a given set of conditions a quantum state can be predicted, but measuring it changes it into something impossible to predict. cyclicity creates a repeating model with predictive inflection points with characteristic behavior if we are monitoring the right variables. The myan calender is especially scary for 2012 as it simply stops at the end of time. But could the myan’s predict the end of their civilization or that their descendends would be working in new york as day labor? Unlikely. The only thing truly supranatural to our senses is quantum physics as all the contradictory possiblities happen concurrently with different weightings. It boggles the mammalian mind that processes information a certain way. That doesn’t make it not so. Can the mammalian mind predict one off events? well we retrospectively predicted the big bang but did it even happen with all we know now? Surely an asteroid or large comet could do big damage, again. What would be the inner math to such an event. Look up tensor calculus and the power of vector linear algebra. According to that there is an inner mathematical logic to the external calculations we derive that bring us to our inflection points. Is it possible there is a pure inner mathematical elegance to our physical world that is beyond our normal calculations, yet still there wrapped up in the relationships among the numbers? If you look at second and third order derivatives of changing ratios and how they cluster in our topology you begin to get a glimpse at the real “innards” of our world we measure in ordinary terms.|`|AA11649485	People are far too gullible.

The same thing could be said about The Bible.<br>  <br>  The Aztecs conquered the Mayans and absorbed the Mayan culture. There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.|`|Cx7ZTsJDaa	These kinds of predictions come from self-credentialed quacks, crackpots, and scurrilous media opportunists. This would not have been nearly such a big deal if it hadn't been for the History Channel and its unconscionable programming decision to air that abysmal documentary -- not once, but several times.<br>  <br>  Nothing that has been rumored about some disaster or the end of the world in 2012 is true. There will be no galactic "alignment." The sun appears to cross the galactic equator on December 21, EVERY year and it does not, and will not, cross the galactic center. And even if it did, there would be absolutely no effect from it.<br>  <br>  The Mayans did not predict or imply the end of the world. And even if they did, so what? Various people or groups claiming some special insight have predicted the end of the world numerous times, just within my own lifetime and we're all still here. Some claim this was predicted by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Aztecs, the I Ching, etc., and every one of those claims is bogus. No, I don't just mean the predictions are wrong; I mean those people never even MADE any such predictions. Again, this is the result of liars and frauds who post things to the Internet or who manage to write a book or get their faces in front of a camera. Some television networks will air anything they think will get more viewers to see their commercials. It's all about making money from their sponsors.<br>  <br>  Other claims people make are equally bogus. There is NO planet Nibiru. The earth's magnetic poles will NOT flip in one particular day -- or year -- or century. That process takes thousands of years. And the earth's axial poles, don't EVER flip. People who talk about this Planet X are equally ill-informed and need to learn which sources of information are reliable. There is no such planet. That hypothesis was ruled out over a decade ago. If such a long term planet existed and it was due to be close to us in 2012, it would be inside the orbit of Saturn by now. Astronomers everywhere, even amateurs, would know about it. But there isn't a single one who claims the existence of this object. Again, this comes from people who post to the Internet without having a clue what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  There is NO computer program which can predict the end of the world and the creep who says he wrote such a program is also a liar and a fraud. And no, none of these claimed sources ever predicted 9-11 like their advocates say they did.<br>  <br>  There is no cyclical event which is due to recur in 2012, except for a solar maximum. These happen about every 11 years and there is no reason to believe this upcoming one will be any more harmful than any of the previous ones.<br>  <br>  This bunk is being pushed by unprincipled people looking for a profit, (like the History Channel), or out to scare kids or terrorize people back into church, (like St. Birgitta, on Youtube.)<br>  <br>  I can't imagine what kind of preparation there would be, but this isn't going to happen anyway.

The oceans closer to the moon at any given time will have high tide, so will the oceans on the opposite pole.

The moon has a slightly elliptical orbit which takes about 27.3 days to orbit the center of mass of the system. The Earth, being so much larger in mass, "wobbles" because the center of mass of the binary system is inside the Earth, but not at the physical center of the Earth. (By the way, the Sun wobbles because of the planets. This is one way astronomers have used to find planets in orbit about a distant star.) In effect, the Earth rotates on its axis under the Moon as the Moon orbits the Earth. Since the orbit eccentricity is not exactly 1, the orbit is an ellipse, which means that once every 27.3 days, the moon and Earth have a "closest point of approach" situation. Since the closest point of approach happens at odd day intervals, the point on the Earth under the moon at that time is what is affected, and that point changes since there is a fractional part of a day left over which means a different area of the Earth is under the moon when at closest point of approach. If I had an almanac so I could plot the orbit of the moon and plot the rotation of the Earth, I could then predict what point is under the moon when at closest point of approach in exactly the same manner as planetary orbits can be predicted in advance. I have an almanac, but mine is for navigation and includes data for the sun. moon, planets and stars, but nothing for the Earth's orbital parameters.|`|OWtx0a8taa	you wouldnt feel it at all.. because the forces between earth and the moon are unbalanced, and the earths force is greater, so you would only experience the earths pull, and there is the fact that the person is closer to earth, but, theoretically it would be the side that is facing towards the moon, but the force would be minute, you wouldnt even notice it|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	The north pole area.|`|zze8XmjLaa	the left side, i bet.|`|sqjlQ6K8aa	The side facing the moon has a greater pull.

As the name suggests, a polyatomic ion is a group of *several* atoms that are covalently bonded together and act as a single ion.  They differ from normal molecules in that they have a charge.  For example, consider the nitrate ion, NO3(-).  The formula shows that one nitrogen atom and three oxygen atoms are covalently bonded, along with an extra electron that gives the whole structure a negative charge.  In a compound, it behaves similarly to any other -1 ion, such as the chloride or bromide ion, except that it is made up of multiple atoms.<br>  <br>  So you don't find polyatomic ions on the periodic table.

In practice suitable tools may only be available for 110V operation.<br>  <br>  The main reason is the increased risk due to the possibility of welding ""sparks" and hot things falling on a cable and melting the insulation, leaving the possibility of contacting the bare wire and receiving a shock. This contact could make the workpiece live, or not become evident for some time, increasing the risk. It is common practice to use air operated tools, I guess to avoid the electrical issues. Risk has not been eliminated however, as a blowout of a damaged air line could be hazardous too in some circumstances, though it is immediately obvious there is a problem. Electrical tools at 110V can be adequately safe using a safety switch that cuts off when the current in the two wires isn't equal, such as when someone touches a bare wire. This reduces the hazard of electric shock significantly. Regular inspections of cables, safety switches and air lines is also important.|`|XCzpQvDvaa	Most tools use 110v, however the welding machines in most shops are 3 phase at 330 volt..or atleast i thnk(not an electrician im just a simple welder lol)

Richard Gott 3d, proposed that the longevity of things can be estimated remarkably well from their histories. All that is needed to calculate roughly how long something is likely to last is to assume that there is nothing special about it -- nothing to particularly distinguish it from all the other objects or systems or creatures or intervals of time in its class. Theorists call this assumption the "Copernican principle," referring to the Polish astronomer Copernicus, who concluded that the Earth was not at the center of the solar system (or universe), and therefore did not occupy any "special" place.<br>  <br>  Based on this seemingly simple idea, Dr. Gott predicted that intelligent human beings would probably exist on Earth a maximum of 7.8 million years, a minimum of 5,128 years, or somewhere in between. This calculation, he said, requires no knowledge of how or why the human race might end, and is based solely on the fact that Homo sapiens first appeared on Earth about 200,000 years ago. <br>  <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D8113AF932A35755C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...</a><br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  OLD CHALLENGE.

MAruysqiaa	AsFar....  Couldn't be more wrong if he tried.  His statements are centered in a naive understanding of the BB and doppler shifts.<br>  <br>  (1) The big bang was not something that "exploded".  Nothing exploded.  Let me say it again.  NOTHING EXPLODED.  There is no center.  There was no instant before.  It is/was an expansion.  That's it.  Just expansion.  <br>  <br>  (2) The phrase "doppler shift" as applied to galaxies is technically correct, but very simplistic and a bit deceiving.  In the everyday world, we experience doppler shift by listening to the siren of a passing car.  But this literally means, we are stationary and the car passes us by.  While the same would happen if we were moving ourselves (provided we weren't moving with exactly the same velocity vector), this is NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE UNIVERSE.  Galaxies are moving, yes, but that's not the source of the shift.  The shift comes from the expansion.  <br>  <br>  So a better picture, would be:  Imagine the galaxies are nailed down to a piece of the Universe.  Denote that space a proper distance between the objects.  But now, let's imagine that at one instant there is somehow more *SPACE* between them, even though they didn't move.  The space moved.  Sorta like you standing stationary on North America, but your distance to France is increasing (the continent itself is moving).  In Universe itself moves.  But it's slight different.  It's expansion, so a better analogy still, would be a photo enlarging device.  Consider a photograph.  Draw two spots on the photo.  Now enlarge the photo, with the spots.  The distance between the spots is larger.  EVEN THOUGH THE SPOTS DID NOT MOVE!  This is exactly what's happening in the Universe.  The Universe (like the photo) is expanding and the distances between any 2 points is increasing.  We measure this increase as a velocity, which we interpret as a doppler shift of light.  <br>  <br>  Why does this support the BB?  Well, this was the first piece of evidence for the BB.  The uniform velocities which get larger as the distance between objects is increased, directly implies expansion.  However, you could imagine another scenario where you could get the spectral shifts, which does not have doppler shifts, such as the Alfven or the steady state cosmologies.  But this observation is most simply and "elegantly" explained by the BB.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	Like..  Totally!!<br>  <br>  Doug

UFteXlqwaa	Actually, it doesn't change at all. The air is much, much less denser than water and its temperature can't change the water temperature.<br>  <br>  What does, though, is the sunlight. While water tend to reflect more light energy that land (you get more sunburns on the water than on land) it also allows energy to be stored lower under the surface because light penetrates through water.<br>  <br>  It is the water then, that warms up a thin layer of air right above the surface. That air then rises but soon cools adiabatically because the pressure drops, and ... stops rising.<br>  <br>  That's why the higher you get, the colder it is.<br>  <br>  The air temperature may vary very much because it is constantly replaced by the wind. But the sea temperature remains pretty much the same and that's why the sea works as a climate damper; evening out the coastal climate and delaying the seasons.|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	It can vary, being either warmer or colder than the air temperature.  Generally the water temperature will be cooler than the air temperature during the warmer times of the year, while during cold spells the water can be warmer than the air.  This effect is what is behind the events known as Lake effect snows, where cold air blows across the relatively warm water and becomes unstable, creating narrow bands of intense snow.|`|OkJNoU9Uaa	I'm pretty sure that water is a few (or more degrees) cooler than the air temperature.

AA10335036	1. I find it easiest to turn the setup upside-down so you have a seesaw pivoted at 1/4 its length with an 8000 N vertical load at the pivot. What weights sit on the ends of the seesaw to balance it? Obviously the weights sum to 8000 N, and the torques about the pivot sum to 0. Torque = weight*length, where length is distance from pivot. With a length ratio of 3:1 the weight ratio must be 1:3. You can take it from there.<br>  2. Now we really have a seesaw but it's not in balance. Sum the individual torques using torque = weight*length. Pay attention to sign of weight and length. Length is distance from pivot to weight, not the other way. Thus positive weights on the right side (+x) yield positive torque. Draw a picture if it helps. Note you can ignore the seesaw weight because that's balanced.

HoqwtnGYaa	Seawater is more enriched in dissolved ions of all types than fresh water. However, the ratios of various solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater is about 2.8 times more enriched with bicarbonate than river water based on molarity, the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of all dissolved ions is far lower than in river water; bicarbonate ions constitute 48% of river water solutes, but only 0.41% of all seawater ions.Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes; sodium and chlorine have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate out much more quickly.<br>  <br>  The presence of the other dominant ion of salt, chloride, results from "outgassing" of chloride (as hydrochloric acid) with other gases from Earth's interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.|`|b1hXdKHCaa	Here's a USGS artical explaining it:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salty_ocean.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salt...</a>|`|iTYOkRUNaa	Mineral salts.

Weathering and dissolution of rocks by rainfall <br>  ? Weathering and dissolution of rocks by rivers <br>  ? Injection of salts and minerals from hydrothermal vents <br>  ? Outgassing from volcanoes (both above ground and under the ocean) <br>  ? Recycling of crustal material and ejection by volcanoes (i.e. island arcs)

They use it in a liquid injectable form during surgeries so the patient does not feel anything during the surgery that is what is used in the epidural that women get when they are going through labor.|`|HxXduL1maa	All local anesthetics are membrane stabilizing drugs; they reversibly decrease the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes (like nociceptors). Though many other drugs also have membrane stabilizing properties, all are not used as local anesthetics, for example propranolol. Local anesthetic drugs act mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through sodium-specific ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane, in particular the so-called voltage-gated sodium channels. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in inactivated state, thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in neurons that are rapidly firing. This is referred to as state dependent blockade.<br>  Local anesthetics are weak bases and are usually formulated as the hydrochloride salt to render them water-soluble. At the chemical's pKa the protonated (ionised) and unprotonated (unionised) forms of the molecule exist in an equilibrium but only the unprotonated molecule diffuses readily across cell membranes. Once inside the cell the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium, with the formation of the protonated (ionised form), which does not readily pass back out of the cell. This is referred to as "ion-trapping". In the protonated form, the molecule binds to the local anaesthetic binding site on the inside of the ion channel near the cytoplasmic end.<br>  Acidosis such as caused by inflammation at a wound partly reduces the action of local anesthetics. This is partly because most of the anaesthetic is ionised and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the sodium channel.<br>  All nerve fibres are sensitive to local anesthetics, but generally, those with a smaller diameter tend to be more sensitive than larger fibres. Local anesthetics block conduction in the following order: small myelinated axons (e.g. those carrying nociceptive impulses), non-myelinated axons, then large myelinated axons. Thus, a differential block can be achieved (i.e. pain sensation is blocked more readily than other sensory modalities).

Also, most of them will encourage you to look through their scopes. so you can try before you buy ;)<br>  <br>  Consider joining your local astronomy club.

However, you certainly don't need as expensive scope as he recommends.  I see you've already been pointed to a Dob - ignore those repsodnents.

Dobs are cheap but that is their only benefit, and they are actually limited in a number of respects.<br>  <br>  However, make sure the scope you get is reasonable quality.  There are some good 60mm refractors on sale but sadly they are vastly outnumbered by what are effectively children's toys.  Do your research beforehand and make sure you get a respected brand.

The following will give you the answer. 60 seconds x 15 minutes = 900 seconds. Then you use your 5 m/s x 900 = 4500; and 4 m/s x 900 = 3600. Then you take 4500 - 3600 = 900. 900/2 = 450. Either add to 3600 or subtract from 4500 and your answer is 4050 meters. Simple way of figuring. You can make it more complicated if you want and there again I am not 100 percent I am right.

You have two copies of this gene, one from each parent. So two copies of A or one plus an O allele give you the A blood type, because only an A antigen is expressed. If you have one A allele and one B allele you are AB as both are expressed. two copies of the O allele means you have no ABO antigens and are therefore type O.

So just shake this experience off by saying how much you appreciate the lesson. Now sit still & see how you feel. Are you feeling fear? Then start saying the opposite until you feel it.

You say that you are a very spiritual person, there should be no reason for your aura to be covered in darkness. <br>  <br>  Number one, don't be scared. You need to trust that your higher power is looking out for you at all times and the only reason that some people are able to pull off curses and black magick is because of fear. Fear can take us out of alignment of Divine protection. <br>  <br>  Second, take a salt bath. A salt bath will cleanse your aura.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kind of spiritual person you are so I am trying to give you neutral things that you can do. If you work with the Angels or are open to working with the Angels, then call on Archangel Michael and ask that he removes all negativity from you and to remove any negative attachments. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could do a return to sender chant...you basically say "I return to sender all negativity that has been intentionally sent to me and I release that person in love and light."<br>  <br>  I have studied and applied a lot of different kinds of spiritual methods so feel free to email if none of that feels right for you. Feel free to email for any reason. <br>  <br>  Lastly, most of us learn the hard way that not all gifted people are good people. Unfortunately psychic capabilities are not given to just the good people in the world. <br>  <br>  As a spiritual person, you might face some negativity and so you should know how to protect yourself from things like this.

I know that sounds silly, but the truth behind this is that our thoughts are energy. The more we think on something the more power we give it. <br>  <br>  Here's a meditation to help with the separation. Think of a beautiful infinity symbol floating in space. Next put yourself in a white bubble inside one half. Next put her in a white bubble in the other half.<br>  <br>  Then think of one positive thing that you learned from this experience. Next think of one positive thing that you taught her in this experience.<br>  <br>  next imagine a giant pair of silver scissors. Next, visualize those scissors cutting the infinity symbol at the halfway point. Watch as you each drift away from each other.<br>  <br>  Other ways to help clear your aura. - take a long bath with a bit of sea salt in the water, as well as some essential oils used for clearing. I recommend clary sage, patchouli and or verti vert. Make sure you get yourself  wet all over - even your hair. Imagine you are washing off any negative connections, any negative influences, and feel clean, protected and refreshed.<br>  <br>  If you need any more help, or want other ideas, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :)<br>  Peace|`|IVy35SE2aa	The power of suggestion can affect your mind and belief systems<br>  to a degree we can barely imagine.

No gifted person would ask for money though they might  take a donation, but this could be as small as you like, perhaps a cake or bar of chocolate, though cigarettes are often welcome.  (I hate smoking) <br>  <br>  But, as most of us can be scared by an impressive scam, then you need some help to get out of it.  Do what you can for yourself.  You say that you have special abilities, then believe wholly in them and feel yourself getting stronger than this woman.   <br>  <br>  When did she ask for money, before or after?  Is there any local law against fraudulent mediums? Some have been sued for taking money in England.  <br>  <br>  It is a shame you do not have any of the grapefruit. But try getting some friends to sit and think about protecting you and sending out good wishes, say once every night at 8pm, or weekly if they are busy. Or get some red and some green wool.  Make bracelets or just tie red and green on each wrist. As you do the red say may the gods be with and protect me three times, and with the green say may the earth mother protect and look after me, then imagine being in a lovely green valley with the earth mother Gaia and with the gods looking down on you from the heavens. <br>  <br>  Try a spiritualist 'church' or an alternative group if you need more help and advice.|`|2pD0Ot4raa	You were concerned because some random crazy woman you don't know said some random crazy thing to try and scam you, and you believed it?

A comet 20 kilometres across is huge compared to a basketball but compared to the Earth or even the Moon it is tiny.  <br>  <br>  Such small objects are invisible at the distances that they spend most of their time considering that sunlight is quite weak out past Neptune. <br>  <br>  Small and badly lit is the reason they are invisible.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	There are thousands of records, dating from ancient China, the Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, on up to the present day.

0ENFApaAaa	It sounds as though the thing you are talking about is a high frequency transformer.  As you probably know, transformers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction as discovered by Michael Faraday.  Basically the primary is connected to a source of ac power, and sets up a magnetic flux, and this flux then links a secondary winding in which a voltage is induced.  In the secondary, the induced voltage is numerically equal to the product (number of turns N) x (rate of change of flux dF/dt).  <br>  <br>  Many transformers have a magnetic core which has 3 main functions -<br>  <br>  1) It directs the flux created by the primary so that almost all of it links the secondary also, and very little escapes.<br>  <br>  2) Because the core material has a high permeability, it magnifies the amount of flux which results form the magnetising effect of the current in the primary.  This magnification can be several thousand times if the right material is used.<br>  <br>  3) When the transformer is off-load (no secondary current) the primary acts as an inductor, and a small magnetising current flows which is mainly reactive (i.e. it is 90 degrees out of phase with the applied voltage).  The magnetic core has the effect of raising the primary inductance, and so reduces the magnetising current to such a small value that it can often be ignored.  <br>  <br>  If the transformer is intended to operate at a high frequency (say several MHz instead of the 50Hz which is normal for power circuits), then it is completely practical for the primary to have sufficient inductance for the magnetising current to be small even without a magnetic core (i.e. using an air core).  This would be the situation in your device when the device being charged is removed. Under these circumstances the primary would draw a small reactive current from the supply, and the power dissipated would be minimal - caused only by the magnetising current flowing in the resistance of the primary winding, and both would be small quantities.  This answers your first question.<br>  <br>  Re your second question - this automatic shut-down might not be necessary in view of what has already been said.  But if some such shut-down were required it could be done on the basis of power factor.  Off-load the primary is mainly inductive (small power factor) on-load it is mainly resistive (large power factor) so a circuit could be designed which would increase the applied voltage when the PF is high, and reduce the voltage when the PF is small.|`|BrarMA1Haa	Cutting the transformer would separate the ferromagnetic core into two halves, inserting air into the magnetic path.  The self-inductance of the primary coil would diminish greatly (on the order of 1/1000), and excessive current would flow as a result.  I would expect the primary coil to burn up in short order.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Platypus Genome Explains Animal's Peculiar Features; Holds Clues To Evolution Of Mammals<br>  ScienceDaily (May 7, 2008)<br>  <br>  The platypus represents the earliest offshoot of the mammalian lineage some 166 million years ago from primitive ancestors that had features of both mammals and reptiles. "What is unique about the platypus is that it has retained a large overlap between two very different classifications, while later mammals lost the features of reptiles," says Wes Warren, Ph.D., an assistant professor of genetics, who led the project.<br>  Comparison of the platypus genome with the DNA of humans and other mammals, which diverged later, and the genomes of birds, whose ancestors branched off an estimated 315 million years ago, can help scientists fill gaps in their understanding of mammalian evolution.

That would yield 1000 W of power.<br>  <br>  Part B: 1 Watt is 1 J/s you seek Joules so 1000 J/s times 3600 seconds gives 3600000 J of energy or 3.6 MJ.<br>  <br>  Part C: if you have 15% efficient solar panels the only 15% of the 3.6 MJ is captured, thus 3.6 MJ times .15 is 540 kJ.<br>  <br>  Part D: We need to convert kJ into Kw-h by dividing by 3600. Thus 540000 J times 1hr/3600s = 150 W-h.

Gnfc4wRlaa	The Earth is about 4.6 billion years old.  How old our civilization is depends on what you consider "our civilization".  Modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, appeared about 130,000 years ago.  The area between the Tigris and Euphrates in what is now Iraq is often called the "Cradle of Civilization", but it is thought that more civilizations developed around the same time in the fertile crescent.  According to the following timeline, that would have been between 10,000 B.C. and 4,000 B.C, but there were agricultural settlements as early as 12,000 B.C.<br>  <br>  "The cradle of civilization is any of the possible locations for the emergence of civilization. It is usually applied to the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic (Ubaid period, Naqada culture), especially in the Fertile Crescent (viz. Lower Egypt, the Levant and Mesopotamia), but also extended to sites in Anatolia and the Persian Plateau, besides other Asian cultures situated along large river valleys, notably the Indus River in Indian Subcontinent and the Yellow River in China."<br>  <br>  "The earliest signs of a sedentarization process can be traced back to the Mediterranean region to as early as 12000 BC, when the Natufian culture became sedentary and evolved into an agricultural society by 10000 BC."<br>  <br>  Homo sapiens - 400,000 to 200,000 years BCE<br>  Homo sapiens neandertalensis - 200,000 to 30,000 years BCE<br>  Homo sapiens sapiens - 130,000 years BCE to present<br>  <br>  10,000 B.C.<br>  Semi-permanent agricultural settlements in Old World.<br>  10,000–4,000 B.C.<br>  Development of settlements into cities and development of skills such as the wheel, pottery, and improved methods of cultivation in Mesopotamia and elsewhere.<br>  5500–3000 B.C.<br>  Predynastic Egyptian cultures develop (5500–3100 B.C.); begin using agriculture (c. 5000 B.C.).

Thus it only has accuracy to one decimal point. Thus the correct way to record results would be either 0.123m or 12.3 cm.<br>  <br>  Someone said that a cm has "only one decimal place". A unit of measure has no inherent precision. I can convert any result into cm. The wavelength of red light may be say 7E2nm = 0.7um = 0.0007mm = 0.00007 cm = 7E-5 cm.<br>  <br>  Nitpick: it's not a "meter" stick.

KRheZ21daa	Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and an acid substance too (usually cream of tartar). Both are used to make baked goods rise, but baking soda only works when another acidic ingredient is present.<br>  <br>  So, bottom line: you can substitue baking powder if you're out of baking soda, but if you're out of baking powder you can't use baking soda instead*<br>  <br>  *unless you have cream of tatar. Then you can make your own baking powder with 2 parts cream of tatar and 1 part baking soda.
gTDzR23jaa	Someone said that 1/3 is irrational because it is recurring.  that is wrong.  Irrational means that there is no pattern to the decimals, o, more mathematically, an irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a/b, where a and b are integers.

One third is an irrational number.  So, 0.3, lots of 3s is correct.  The symbol for a repeating decimal is a bar drawn over the repeating part.  The answer would then be 0.3 (bar over 3).

d6XAz5xXaa	Here's an idea.<br>  <br>  Place one magnet on the balance.  Put the other magnet a variable distance above the first and see how the reading on the balance scale changes at the distance between the magnets changes.  <br>  <br>  Analysis:<br>  <br>  The weight of the first magnet is a force.  You know that if you apply an attractive force to the magnet through a second magnet, the downward force of gravity will start to be balanced by the magnetic attraction.  Take measurements at several distances and see how much the weight changes.  The change of weight is then the attractive force of the magnet, as a function of distance.<br>  <br>  For extra credit, replace the second magnet with a current-carrying wire and repeat the experiment, varying distance and current.  Then compare the induced magnetic field to the static one in the horseshoe magnet.

2mX8K8bdaa	Here is the simplest experiment to test this hypothesis.  Solvents A & B are at two different temperatures.  Solvent A has a temperature of T1, and solvent B has a temperature of T2.   Have students put solute into solvent A until it no longer dissolves.  Have the students record the mass of the solute used.  (make sure there is continuous stirring).  Next, using the same solute, have the students place solute into solvent B until it no longer dissolves (make sure there is continuous stirring/ agitation of the solution).  Have the students record the mass of the solute that was put into solvent B.  The solvent with the higher temperature should dissolve the highest mass of solute.  [[[[[solvent volumes should be kept the same as each other]]]]]]]].  Plot the results on a graph of y versus x.  (temperature of solvent versus mass-solute dissolved).|`|UEbqy7lUaa	I would say try dissolving a powder mixture of the hot chocolate package into cold water. ya, it mixes, but if you add hot water to it, then it dissolves completely and fully.|`|NrJOGY52aa	Well first you would need a negative control to prove that only change in temperature is affecting the solubility, lets say a solution at room temperature. Then for every variable temperature add your solute, and then when you think the maximum amount has dissolved filter via büchner funnel, and record the mass of the unfiltered solute. I presume your solvent is water, so I recommend not going near 100oC (probably around 85 max) since the water will boil decreasing the solvent volume, and introducing an unaccounted variable.

Vnu2HBBLaa	A license can help you in your profession.<br>  Many engineering jobs can only be given to people who are licensed. The license shows that you know engineering very well. It also has some legal purposes. By getting the license you have a certain code of ethics. This allows you to manage large products.<br>  I think that licenses are more important to some fields of engineering than others. I know that civil engineers should all get licensed because they work on large scale public projects.|`|f3clvg4kaa	in US 80% of jobs are filled through a competitive exam ination of your background, work experience, and education not throgh a written test there are specific careers such as law enforcement, clerical, and air traffic controllers to take and pass a comprehensive entrance exam, however high school graduation or the equivalent may be substituted for  experience at the GS-2 level for all listed occupations except clerk-stenographer. according to above interviews are kind FA to screen job candidates.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	In a slightly different scope, the FE is required to take the PE, which is what actually gives you a license.

The employer may need licensed people to take responsibility for designs, and that in turn needs understanding of regulations, which may depend on where you are working, which might be different to where you got the degree. The degree may have touched on occupational health, safety, environment, equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination. It could not explain the differences in different countries, states, even cities, just too much detail. Employers have legal responsibilities to comply with these things. They want some assurance that you really do know - in fact legally, they need proof. Some of this is about passing legal responsibility for a design to the engineer, supervisor etc.
G3LpGWXbaa	I would say so. There is a much finer line between an EE and a tech than there is between an ME and a mechanic.<br>  <br>  If you are asking in terms of coop, that is exactly what I did. I worked as an electronic technician, troubleshooting motor controllers for a power transmission distributor, and received credit hours. I was also paid an hourly wage!|`|jMqaBDdWaa	if you are talking about an application to take the professional engineer exam, the board won't give you full credit for it, but you may get some. They'll want to see design work, not technician level work.|`|jsW45ETkaa	As technician works with already GIVEN part numbers and a schemantic. For instance in a USAF T.O.(technical order manual) I saw all the ideal by design (of an engineer) the voltages, frequencies, currents or whatever the engineer knew we techs would need to know in  order to see if the equipment is working to standards ( set by the engineer) and if not, exactly where it wasn't meeting standards and if something tested bad in one place, was it caused by something else back elsewhere ( a fuse blows so the initial failure is the fuse, but you replace the fuse and it blows again, so obviosly the real failure that is causing the fuse to blow is elsewhere)  A tech might "breadboard" a circuit wiring it and using components (transistors,capacitors, resistors, new devices right out of a professional engineering magazine , etc.) but the tech makes no decisions other than how he routes a temporary wire, he follows exact eng's directions and is just hire for he's cheaper than using an engineer's time just to test a new circuit or rather build the circuit for him to test himself.  It has been so many decades unused by me I remember type A gain for  a transistor and believe there are only types A,B & C gain.  The sum of the voltages around a circle is always zero and so is the sum of all currents into a node.  About the only equation a tech uses if he is troubleshooting is Ohm's Law ...E = I R , that's for eng. tech uses V = A R or IR, I forgot but voltage = current (in amps) x resistance (in Ohms)  The engineer works with much more math and studies how electron flow in transistors and diodes ( there are fewer options like no more pentodes since solid state replaced tubes) and as I was saying he knows electron flow plus the flow of HOLES (empty spaces to accept electrons) when using "Classical" current flow from positive to negative instead of how "everybody" knows it flows from neg. to pos. except for the geniuses in early electricity who hadn't yet discovered the electron as the free moving object.  I forgot, the eng, has a long table(s) from transistor manufacturer(s) listing the A,B & C gains for each model or part number transistor from which the eng. chooses for the right gain in the right place such as in a string of amplifier steps. If a wire happens to be route thru a small hole in a metal wall inside perhapps a receiver, the engineer must know the characteristics of the type of metal and actually calculate the effect of the tiny capacitance between the wire and the wall encircling the wire but after first calculating what that tiny capacitances is. THEN WHAT IS THE CIRCUIT FOR, A CONTROL, A MEASURE, A SENSOR FOR A GUIDED BOMB?  In my case I took elec eng technology, the 4 year B.S. version just (think word is certified) at the time. Besides basicly transistor circuits for amplifiers and higher power devices such as a strereo amp we touched on TV and microwave(as used for comm, not cooking) Boolean Algebra to design computer logic circuits such as might convert the 1s and 0s inside a binary coded decimal register of a computer output into a human recognized number of a 7 segment display. Look at a large digital clock ( not "digital" with mechanic flipping numbers ink printed on plastic tabs ) but real digital where numbers using LEDs lightup and you will see 7 pieces forming the number 8 and the Boolean logic reads the 1s and 0s and decides which combination of the 7 pieces to light for all numbers 0 thru 9. Look at the 8 which is the only using all 7 pieces or segments...remove the center segment (logic = off) and it looks like a zero. Relight the center and turn off the bottom left of the 8 and it looks like the greater number 9 though it uses one less segment.  Then I had a few physics courses, statics and dynamics (everything from bull dozers to bridge design to targeting an intercontinental missle to given a small weigh attached to a board by a rubber band of given elasticity and launched at so many inches per second at some angle to the radius under "ideal conditions" at what distance or radius will the weight orbit the attachment point or how gyros of various shape work and precess not intellectually hard but a killer course due to worked out examples every few pages then a few problems then a long list of problem with exactly half in the answer book so you learn to trust your own calculations for you might be designing life critical things with nobody to ask for it's your original design for say a bridge. I forgot we not only studied electronics which are relatively safe ( 6000 Volts is the max I worked around in the USAF) but we also studied delta and Y transformer and generators as used in the 500,000Volt power company applications. THIS IS LONG SO I WILL COMPRESS A LOT TO FINISH QUICKY.

wDMWkYUcaa	m1 will accelerate in the horizontal direction, towards the edge of the table. m2 will accelerate in the vertical direction, towards the floor.<br>  <br>  For m1, we can ignore the vertical forces acting on it since there is no friction (normal force is not needed) and since the normal force and m1's weight balance out - it can't accelerate up or down, just sideways.<br>  <br>  T, the magnitude of tension in the rope, acts forward. This is the only force acting on m1 in the horizontal direction.<br>  <br>  F = ma<br>  T = m1 a<br>  <br>  Let a be the magnitude of each object's acceleration. m1 and m2 will have the same acceleration because in this case, there is only 1 fixed pulley (no mechanical advantage). The direction of the accelerations are different, of course: m1 accelerates [forward]; m2 accelerates [down].<br>  <br>  If we analyze the forces acting on m2:<br>  T, the tension in the string acts up<br>  m2 g, its weight acts down<br>  <br>  F = ma<br>  m2 g - T = m2 a<br>  Subtract the larger force from the smaller force. We know the second block's weight must be greater than the tension in the string because the block will accelerate downward, not up. Since the net force on m2 is in the downward direction, so will its acceleration.<br>  <br>  Now we have 2 unknowns and 2 equations:<br>  T = m1 a<br>  m2 g - T = m2 a<br>  <br>  To solve for a, add the equations:<br>  m2 g = (m1+m2) a<br>  a = [m2/(m1+m2)] g<br>  <br>  For m1: ax = a (if toward the edge is positive), ay = 0<br>  For m2: ax = 0, ay = a (if down is positive)<br>  <br>  To solve for T, substitute this result into the first equation:<br>  T = [m1m2/(m1+m2)] g<br>  <br>  If m2 = 0, then a = 0<br>  <br>  In general, as long as m2 has some mass, there will be a net force acting on the system: the weight of m2. Where there's a net force, there will be a net acceleration (non-zero).<br>  <br>  Since the masses are connected and will have the same acceleration,  we can treat them as a single mass of (m1+m2) and still obtain the same answer. The net force on the system is m2 g.<br>  F = ma<br>  m2 g = (m1 + m2) a<br>  a = [m2/(m1+m2)] g, as expected<br>  <br>  If there were friction, the force of friction would oppose the motion or the start of motion of the system. As long as the weight of m2 does not exceed the maximum frictional force, m1 and m2 will not move.<br>  fmax = μm1g, where m1g is the magnitude of the normal force

The aurora borealis and aurora australis (Latin for "northern" and "southern" dawn, respectively) occur in symmetric ovals centered on the northern and southern magnetic poles of Earth.<br>  <a href="http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aurora_Borealis" rel="nofollow">http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aurora_Bo...</a>|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Northern lights originate from our sun. During large explosions and flares, huge quantities of solar particles are thrown out of the sun and into deep space. These plasma clouds travel through space with speeds varying from 300 to 1000 kilometers per second. <br>  <br>  But even with such speeds (over a million kilometer per hour), it takes these plasma clouds two to three days to reach our planet. When they are closing in on Earth, they are captured by Earth's magnetic field (the magnetosphere) and guided towards Earth's two magnetic poles; the geomagnetic south pole and the geomagnetic north pole<br>  <br>  On their way down towards the geomagnetic poles, the solar particles are stopped by Earth's atmosphere, which acts as an effective shield against these deadly particles.<br>  <br>  When the solar particles are stopped by the atmosphere, they collide with the atmospheric gases present, and the collision energy between the solar particle and the gas molecule is emitted as a photon - a light particle. And when you have many such collisions, you have an aurora - lights that may seem to move across the sky. <br>  <br>  In order for an observer to actually see the aurora with the naked eye, about a 100 million photons are required.|`|OkJNoU9Uaa	Auroras, sometimes called the northern and southern (polar) lights or aurorae (singular: aurora), are natural light displays in the sky, usually observed at night, particularly in the polar regions. They typically occur in the ionosphere. They are also referred to as polar auroras. In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis, named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for north wind, Boreas by Pierre Gassendi in 1621. The aurora borealis is also called the northern polar lights, as it is only visible in the sky from the Northern Hemisphere, the chance of visibility increasing with proximity to the north magnetic pole, which is currently in the arctic islands of northern Canada. Aurorae seen near the magnetic pole may be high overhead, but from further away, they illuminate the northern horizon as a greenish glow or sometimes a faint red, as if the sun was rising from an unusual direction. The aurora borealis most often occurs from September to October and from March to April. The northern lights have had a number of names throughout history. The Cree people call this phenomenon the "Dance of the Spirits."

Two year old kids do it all the time.  Put a ball under a blanket.  The kid sees a round lump.  Immediately his brain goes to work and he perceives that a ball is under the blanket.  Simply from a shape that 'sort of' looks like a ball.  So its no wonder that people perceive familiar shapes in the arrangement of bright stars that only bear a vague resemblance to something they know very well here on earth.

The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same.

D5QgyGbXaa	You left out pressure and temperature of the tank contents.  Also, you didn't give size of person's lung capacity.

With pure oxygen, one could exist with 1/5th that amount.  If tank contents are at pressure of air at 35,000 feet, then the duration would be 1000L/2L/min or 500 min or 8h20m.|`|251A8ysWaa	Actually, assuming tidal volume per intake is 1/4 litre (we certainly do not need this much air, but in a vaacum would consume it anyways), it should take somewhere around 20 minutes.  Of course outside of a vaacum, in the presence of some air, this can be ten to thirty times longer, say 200-1000 minutes.  In any case though, you mentioned he needs 100% of the air (100% oxygen=100% of air intake), so I would say something like 20-25 minutes.

Another form is the quotient rule, but I like the product rule because it's just easier for me to remember. <br>  What I do is rewrite g(x) so that it's a product rather than a fraction:<br>  g(x) = (x^2 - 1)*x^(-1/2)<br>  <br>  Take the derivative of one of the product that has x in it....either (x^2 - 1) or x^(-1/2).<br>  <br>  Say you chose to take the derivative of x^(-1/2) first, all you would then have to do is tag on the other value of g(x) that you didn't take the derivative of. d(x^-1/2) *(x^2 - 1) = -1/2*x^(-3/2)*(x^2 - 1)<br>  <br>  Now, take the derivative of the other value, (x^2 - 1), to get 2x. Just like before, you need to tack on the value that you didn't take the derivative, which is x^(-1/2). d(x^2 - 1) * x^(-1/2) = 2x*x^(-1/2)<br>  <br>  With the two values you obtained [-1/2*x^(-3/2)*(x^2 - 1) and 2x*x^(-1/2)] you simply add those two together. <br>  <br>  Final solution should be of form (f * g)' = f' * g + f * g'<br>  where the  '  means that you're taking the derivative of it...not sure if you've learned that already. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

tPKpfroYaa	The answer is #5<br>  <br>  Each atom needs 8 elections.  There are 4 atoms so they need 32 electron. <br>  <br>  Certain atoms only come with a limited number of valance electrons:  Carbon has four; Oxygen has six; and both chlorides have 7 each.<br>  <br>  So 4, 6, 7, 7 together equals 24.  so you have 24 available electrons.<br>  <br>  Carbon to chloride is a single bond where each atom contributes an electron, meaning 2 electrons are being shared.  There are 2 of these carbon-chloride single bonds so that means we have at least 4 electrons being shared thus far.<br>  <br>  Carbon to oxygen here is a double bond where each atom contributes 2 electrons causing a total of 4 electrons to be shared.  Therefore all together 8 electrons are being shared.

In science, for something to be called a theory, it must have a substantial body of evidence behind it. It must have shown promise in several tests and experiments. Scientists DO NOT throw the word theory around lightly. It's a big deal to call something a theory.<br>  <br>  So, evolution is considered a theory because it has been researched exhaustively and so far, holds true to the original idea.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you, 'oh thats stupid, its just a theory anyway'|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Theory, as used in science, DOES NOT mean "guess"<br>  <br>  A theory is a unifying principle that bring together many seemingly unrelated questions under a single, usually simple explanation.<br>  <br>  Gravity simply states that two bodies attract each other.  Yet, that explains why rain falls, planets orbit stars, people walk on the surface of the Earth, stars start to shine, rivers run downhill and much, much more.  <br>  <br>  The Theory of Evolution explains why whales in the ocean, that are mammals, evolved first on land and then returned to the sea.  It explains why, after an extinction, new species come into being.  It explains why really old fossilized animals are much simpler, yet, are similar to later animals and it explains much, much more. <br>  <br>  The simple concept of evolution is "decent with modification."  The proposed mechanism is natural selection in the face of competition for limited resources.  <br>  <br>  The current mechanism used to explain the fossil record is separate from the actual fossil record.  If a better mechanism were found that would better explain the changes to organisms as evidenced in the fossil record it would replace natural selection.  But the fossil record still remains.<br>  <br>  Simply put- the current Theory of Evolution is the best explanation of the diverse life forms alive today and of the fossil record of past life forms.|`|AA11513203	Please let me gently point something out on this very page.<br>  <br>  Notice the distribution of orange "Top Contributor" flags.   These are not all top contributors in Biology, but all are top contributors in some area of the Science & Mathematics section.  <br>  <br>  I am NOT saying that we "Top Contributors" should be listened to as some sort of authority.  I am not saying that "Top Contributors" are smarter or better.   And I am NOT saying that people who do not yet have a Top Contributors flag are not to be listened to.  Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  But I am saying that one thing all of us TC's have in common is that we all science geeks.  We *LOVE* science enough to post a lot of answers, and those answers apparently are clear and helpful enough that a significant percentage are chosen.   <br>  <br>  We are confirmed science geeks.  We love science because we understand it.  And we understand science because we love it.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the one thing that all of us TCs have in common on this page is that we understand and *STRESS* what the word 'theory' really means in science.  (Again, I am not just talking about evolution ... I am not just talking about Biology ... I am talking about what the word 'theory' means in science in general.)<br>  <br>  In science, a theory is an *EXPLANATION*.<br>  <br>  That is the Holy Grail of science!   Facts are fine, but ultimately boring.  What science is really after are *EXPLANATIONS* of facts.  These we call theories only when they explain a *lot* of facts, and have held up to scrutiny by hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of scientists for years, if not decades (150 years in the case of Darwin).<br>  <br>  So when we say that "Darwin's ideas are considered a theory", this is the highest of complements.   It means that Darwin's ideas have *HUGE EXPLANATORY POWER*.    So calling something a 'theory' is not a diminishment ... not an expression of "doubt" about those ideas ... it is an expression of *admiration*, a complement.<br>  <br>  This *complement* is why Charles Darwin is buried in Westminster Abbey near Isaac Newton ... the greatest scientist who ever lived.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	why are newton's ideas considered a theory?<br>  <br>  ......................................... ....________ <br>  ....................................,.... ...................``~., <br>  .............................,.-”........ ...........................“-., <br>  .........................,/.............. ................................”:, <br>  .....................,?.................. ....................................\, <br>  .................../..................... ......................................,} <br>  ................./....................... ...............................,:`^`..} <br>  .............../......................... ..........................,:”........./ <br>  ..............?.....__............... ..........................:`.........../ <br>  ............./__.(.....“~-,_...... ........................,:`........../ <br>  .........../(_....”~,_........“~,_ ....................,:`........_/ <br>  ..........{.._$;_......”=,_....... “-,_.......,.-~-,},.~”;/....} <br>  ...........((.....*~_.......”=-._. .....“;,,./`..../”............../ <br>  ...,,,___.\`~,......“~.,.......... ..........`.....}............../ <br>  ............(....`=-,,.......`........... ...............(......;_,,-”<br>  ............/.`~,......`-................ .................\....../\ <br>  .............\`~.*-,..................... ..................|,./.....\,__ <br>  ,,_..........}.>-._\................. ..................|..............`=~-, <br>  .....`=~-,_\_......`\,.............. ...................\ <br>  ...................`=~-,,.\,............. ....................\ <br>  ................................`:,,..... .....................`\..............__ <br>  .....................................`... ...................,%`>--==`` <br>  ......................................... ..........._,-%.......`\ <br>  ...................................,<`... |_,-&``................`\|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	The ideas -- natural selection, artificial selection and sexual selection -- explained the data available at the time, they predicted future observations, and the ideas could not be disproved by testing.|`|0Mzywzr1aa	To the point.

This forms hydrogen bonds between water molecules due the attraction of between regions with partial negative charge, and regions with partial positive charge. These H-Bonds are responsible for many of water's unique properties including surface tension. The result is when pressure is placed on one water molecule it is spread out around surrounding, so each particle of water feels less force. Think of an atom of water like surface of a trampoline and the springs of the trampoline are hydrogen bonds. When force is placed on the trampoline the springs (H-Bonds) prevent trampoline from going all the way down.

QTCakn7baa	A caldera is a cauldron-like volcanic feature usually formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption such as the one at Yellowstone National Park. They are sometimes confused with volcanic craters. The word comes from Spanish caldera, and this from Latin CALDARIA, meaning "cooking pot". In some texts the English term cauldron is also used. A caldera like the one surrounding Mount Warning is caused not by a collapse, but by erosion, and is therefore called an erosion caldera.<br>  <br>  A volcanic crater is a circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity. It is typically a basin, circular in form within which occurs a vent (or vents) from which magma erupts as gases, lava, and ejecta. A crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of climactic eruptions, the volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming what may appear to be a crater but is actually known as a caldera.

Their daughters have no chance of being colorblind as a result of this cross.|`|Zkfj2f9Oaa	The fact that colorblindness is recessive means that it is passed on via the same gene that determines the sex of a baby.  So it is passed on either on the X or Y chromosome.  If a trait is passed on on Y chromosomes only then only boys will carry the trait.<br>  <br>  The colorblineness trait is recessive.  This means that for a person to have the trait colorblindness must be present on both sex chromosomes.  If they have colorblindness on one gene only they will be a carrier but wont actually display the trait.<br>  <br>  For a child to display the trait of a recessive disorder they must have received the mutant gene from both their mother and father.<br>  <br>  In this scenario it is possible for the mother to pass on the mutant gene for colorblindness.  The fact she is heterozygous means she has one colorblind gene and one normal.  So she has a 50% chance of passing the mutant gene on.<br>  <br>  The man has normal color vision and therefore can not pass on a mutant gene.  Therefore the children may have one mutant gene but not two so they can only be carriers.<br>  <br>  A child of the couple will have a 25% chance of being a carrier of colorblindness.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this makes sense.|`|XbQaoDj4aa	I have a small amount of color blindness.

euaIzZr4aa	The equation is a curve or line that represents all points on the given curve or line.<br>  For example:  y=2x+3 means when x=10, y=23. When x=2, y=7. When x=20, y=43.

Hermaphrodite was a greek deity born of Hermes and Aphrodite who could be the ultimate sex partner to anyone of either sex. <br>  <br>  No one should be called an "it". Intersexuals almost always present as male or female. I have only seen one person who chose to present as neither sex and that person struck me as a fool. <br>  <br>  An intersexual cannot self-impregnate. Even if there were both pairs of sex organs, the resulting child would almost certainly be stillborn.

But to answer your question, probably, yes, but it would be a very bad idea.|`|CHCPnvksaa	No it's not possible. A hermaphrodite has both male and female organs, but one sex is more dominant, so only either its ovaries or its nuts will work.|`|t7LlAmZnaa	Try it.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	The situation is more complex than your question suggests.<br>  <br>  In some animals, it is normal to be a hermaphrodite.  In those cases, an individual may or may not be able to impregnate itself.  Or, it may usually mate with another individual, the two impregnating each other, but in times of crisis an individual may be able to impregnate itself.<br>  <br>  In humans, hermaphroditism is abnormal.  The either/or reasoning in your question really does not apply.  These Wikipedia articles to give a good overview.<br>  <br>  =================<br>  <br>  A hermaphrodite is an organism having both male and female reproductive organs.[1] In many species, hermaphroditism is a common part of the life-cycle, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which partners are not separated into distinct male and female types of individual. Hermaphroditism most commonly occurs in invertebrates, although it is also found in some fish, and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates.<br>  <br>  Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The term comes from the name of the minor Greek god Hermaphroditus, son of Hermes and Aphrodite (see below).<br>  <br>  Recently, intersex has been used and preferred by many such individuals, encouraging medical professionals to use the term.[2]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodi...</a><br>  <br>  ===<br>  <br>  Intersexuality is the state of a living thing of a gonochoristic species whose sex chromosomes, genitalia, and/or secondary sex characteristics are determined to be neither exclusively male nor female. An intersex organism may have biological characteristics of both the male and female sexes.[1] Intersexuality is the term adopted by medicine during the 20th century applied to human beings whose biological sex cannot be classified as either male or female.[2][3][4] Intersexuality is also the word adopted by the identitary-political movement, to criticize medical protocols in sex assignment and to claim the right to be heard in the construction of a new one.[5]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex</a>|`|yUxh8Eozaa	well if we are talking about humans, there is no such thing as a hermaphrodite only pseudohermaphrodite which they are usually sterile.

Eight of the realms were embodiments of opposites: fire and ice, heaven and hell, creation and destruction, and light and darkness. These realms all converged on the center realm, where humans lived out their lives.<br>  <br>  The ancient Egyptians believed that a person had to earn the right to enter the afterlife. Before an individual could pass into the next realm, nine great gods known collectively as the Ennead had to judge his worthiness.<br>  <br>  In Greek mythology, nine goddesses called the Muses were responsible for inspiring the art of musicians, artists, and writers.<br>  <br>  In Maya mythology, nine levels existed in the underworld.

Centaurs are magical creatures known for their skills as archers, philosophers, and predictors of the future.<br>  [edit]<br>  <br>  As lucky or unlucky number<br>  <br>  Nine (九 pinyin jiǔ) is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "longlasting" (久 pinyin jiǔ). The Japanese consider 9 to be unlucky, however, because it sounds similar to the Japanese word for "pain" or "distress" (苦 kunrei ku).<br>  <br>  Nine is strongly associated with the Chinese dragon, a symbol of magic and power. There are nine forms of the dragon, it is described in terms of nine attributes, and it has nine children.<br>  <br>  In Thai, the word for nine, 'gao', is the same as the verb for 'to develop or progress'.<br>  [edit]<br>  <br>  In music<br>  <br>  In music theory a ninth is the ninth note of a musical scale or the interval between the first note and the ninth. A ninth chord is a chord with a ninth.<br>  <br>  In classical music the curse of the ninth refers to the popular and journalistic notion that some 'mortal' significance attaches to the composition of a 'ninth' symphony, which prevents the composer from writing another. After Beethoven died leaving his Tenth Symphony unfinished, many composers were superstitious about writing Ninth Symphonies for the rest of the nineteenth century. Following the composition of his Eighth, Gustav Mahler tried to "cheat death" by disguising his next symphony as an orchestral song cycle entitled Das Lied von der Erde. Although he went on to complete a work called the Ninth Symphony (which he considered his Tenth), he died before he could complete his Tenth (or, strictly and in his mind, his Eleventh). Perhaps Antonín Dvo?ák was also superstitious about the number nine, because he wrote no symphonies after his New World Symphony, which is nowadays considered his Ninth, but which he thought of was his Eighth because he considered the score of his early C minor symphony lost forever. He lived for seven more years. In the twentieth century, a handful of composers, such as Dmitri Shostakovich, have written a Ninth Symphony and lived to write more.<br>  <br>  Ralph Vaughan-Williams wrote nine complete symphonies, and the last symphony of Anton Bruckner is recognized as his ninth.<br>  <br>  Nine is the number of Valkyries in Richard Wagner's Die Walküre.<br>  <br>  Bands with the number nine in their name include Stroke 9, Nine Days, Nine Inch Nails and Revolution 9.<br>  <br>  In pop music, the song "Love Potion #9" was written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (who also wrote "Riot in Cell Block No. 9"), and became a hit for The Searchers in 1965. The Beatles released a song called "Revolution 9" which appears on The White Album (more properly known as The Beatles); its principle vocal feature is a voice repeating, "Number nine...number nine...number nine..." John Lennon, the primary composer of "Revolution 9", also released a solo recording entitled "#9 Dream", leading his biographer to speculate that he had an obsession with the number.<br>  <br>  Composer Maury Yeston adapted Federico Fellini's 8? for Broadway as the musical Nine, which won several Tony Awards in 1982, and was successfully revived in 2003 starring Antonio Banderas.<br>  <br>  9 is also the name of various albums, including 9 by Mercyful Fate, released in 1999, and 9 by Public Image Limited.

The 360 degrees of the circle, which can be trace back to the Rig Veda of ancient India, can also be seen to speak of the 9, via theosophical addition (3 + 6 + 0 = 9). [2] Cosmologist Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet contends that the 9-part (Enneagram) and the 12-part (Zodiac) divisions of the circle are not meant to be seen and studied as a synthesis, rather than as separate pursuits of knowledge.|`|AA11707872	If you turn it upside down, it's a six.

I am sure that this must have been given to you, or at least some information about where the particle landed horizontally . Without this I am unable to proceed further. <br>  In the above answer I have followed exactly the information you have given.

AA11591140	Most times it is not the loss of passion to practice medicine that drives physicians out of practice. Many older physicians have left medicine because they are from the "old school" where doctors were permitted to order tests,etc without the scrutiny of insurance companies. All the new rules and regs make it harder to do their job.<br>  Next, related again to insurance, is reimbursement. THis is the amount of money insurance companies will pay for services provided. Let's say you go to the doctor for a sore throat. If you have no insurance a new patient visit would cost about $90-100. For that same patient with insurance, the insurance may pay as little as $45. Making physicians need to see more and more patients per day to make a living. <br>  Next, malpractice insurance and medical liability. Malpractice insurance rates have skyrocketed.  Many areas of medicine have just become too pricy to practice. Add to that any lawsuits (frivilous or justified) and your premiums can DOUBLE.<br>  Many physicians feel that all of these things have made medicine too cumbersome and more like business than the art of medicine. We are no longer permitted to practice medicine outside the specific guidelines set forth by many regulating "people". Prescription medicines are driven by price rather than which medicine is best for the patient. It is bureaucracy not practical patient management. <br>  If we could get back to the old ways of medicine I'm sure far fewer would leave medicine.<br>  Sorry this is so long and bleak, but this is the state of medicine from my perspective. I however am not ready to give up my clinical practice despite all of this.|`|48e93c3860ef30becbdb079367708c77aa	I know doctors who have left private practice to:<br>  sell medical devices<br>  grow earthworms<br>  practice medicine abroad<br>  go to law school<br>  go into research<br>  <br>  They are sick of dealing with the insurance, lawsuits and paperwork, and long for a simpler life.|`|257fSlKyaa	I've been into a medical field for some time and I know some young doctors who quit medicine.

Doctors make some much because they are highly educated and they have very had lives. We work close to or over 70 hours a week. We also only get a full month of vacation. So imagine work 70 hours a week, having no time for your family. It is very hard to have a relationship with someone that you barely get to see.

o91grX4zaa	So we have h = √(a^2 + b^2). Squaring this we get h^2 = a^2 + b^2. Now add 2ab to both sides to get h^2 + 2ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Squaring the right-hand-side we get h^2 + 2ab = (a+b)^2. Substitute the ab on the left-hand-side with ab = 50 to obtain h^2 +100 = (a+b)^2. Let the perimeter be denoted as p = a + b + h, so a + b = p - h. Now substitute this in h^2 + 100 = (a+b)^2 to get h^2 + 100 = (p-h)^2. Expand out the right-hand-side to get h^2 + 100 = p^2 - 2hp + h^2. Cancel h^2 from both sides to get 100 = p^2 - 2hp. Now rearrange to put h in terms of p: (p^2 - 100)/(2p) = (p/2) - (50/p).

AA11432707	There is a reason why some people who were practicing physicians in Russia are taking jobs as technicians here in the US.  They just do not have the same depth of education and training as US trained physicians.<br>  <br>  I've been through the process, and still feel like there is SO much more I could have learned.  After the 8 yrs of school, you know just enough to be dangerous.  It's in residency that you really learn to practice medicine.  The truth is, we never stop learning.  It doesn'e end with med school graduation or completion of residency - it's a lifelong process.<br>  <br>  I think if you knew more about it, you'd find that countries with less stringent educational requirements do not have the same quality of care as those with higher requirements.<br>  <br>  We don't practice medicine for the money,  or because our parents wanted us to.  Those of us who are meant to do it put up with the hassle and debts of training to be able to do what we are called to do.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you aren't going into medicine - there are plenty of other opportunities for a smart person like yourself.  Find what you love and do that.|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	Only your first two years of med school are spent in classes, after that you do rotations in hospitals. And residencies are paid, real work - though obviously the salary is very little compared to the amount of work done.

Dunno, I went to med school in Mexico where you don't do undergrad. 4 years of med school (first 2 years in classrooms and the other two a mix of classroom classes and clinical rotations in hospitals), 1 year of internship where you work and virtually live in a hospital working under supervision of attendings and residents and a final year exclusive to Mexico where you do a community service as a junior doctor in some random clinic in a village. You do 3 exams and when they release you from the service you graduate.<br>  <br>  I personally like the mexican system more. If you're sure to become a doctor, you don't want to waste your time with endless art history 101 classes that aren't relevant. People will quit the career anyways (most of them during the first 2 years). If you have made it to become an intern, it's unlikely you'll drop out now.<br>  <br>  I do agree, it's a long career. It's worst as a student because you aren't earning any money and few peope have the free time to have parttime jobs as students. I like being an intern more. You're actually doing something useful and while you still respond to your university a bit, you're now working.<br>  <br>  However, medicine is a long career not because the material is in particular difficult, it's because it's just an insane amount of material that needs to be covered. And even then, I feel like the material was covered to little. I's highly be suspicious of an educational system that teaches you everything about medicine in just 3 years.<br>  <br>  Residency is when you have already graduated as a general doctor. You choose a specialty like general surgery and get trained and being paid for it (albeit not a great salary though) working insanely long hours for a certain number of years to that goal. A surgeon will not be taught public health topics for example. They are taught to operate.|`|MSO4I0Yhaa	It is so long because of the multitudes of diseases and factors in someone's health.

If you don't have a scale, you could also use volume, e.g., fill the can with water (I'm assuming the 34.5 oz is the mass of coffee, not the fl oz volume of the can?) to see how much volume it holds with and without the pennies . . .<br>  <br>  If you want a rough figure, and the 34.5oz is a volume, with a 60% packing efficiency, and 0.0121 fl oz/penny, you have $17 in the can.<br>  <br>  But you say $10 only took a little off the top.  How much?  Then we could tell you how many are in the can.

So every time we buy organic we are, in effect, voting with our dollars. Most shoppers say they buy organic food for reasons of personal or family health, the environment, and/or animal welfare. Are these valid reasons for buying organic?<br>  <br>  Let’s face it, everything we do in our lives involves some level of risk, whether it’s crossing a street or running with the bulls. The rules or standards for organic agriculture and food are designed to take a precautionary approach. That’s not to say that non-organic food isn’t safe. Our food system is carefully regulated, whether it is organic or not. However, just as crosswalks are used to reduce the risk associated with crossing the street, organic has developed standards intended to minimize risks associated agriculture and food. <br>  <br>  Until recently, claims could not be made about the benefits of organic production systems or products. In the UK, however, the British Code of Advertising has now accepted 22 claims that can be made about organic food1. These claims cover everything from pesticides, food additives, fats, antibiotics, vitamins and minerals, genetic engineering, animal welfare, wildlife and the environment. These claims are supported by a growing body of research that has been designed to compare organic foods and production systems with other systems2. <br>  <br>  The science behind organic agriculture is developing quickly as people and policy makers are paying more attention to health and the environment. For example, there is increasing evidence of risks associated with pesticide residues in food3. We now have scientific data showing that organic foods contain fewer kinds of pesticide residues and at lower concentrations4. Organic also restricts the use of most chemical additives in foods. However, scientists cannot easily make direct links between pesticide residues or additives and risks to human health As a result, the organic standard takes a precautionary approach, and severely restricts the use of pesticides and additives. And the standard works; eating organic food has been shown to reduce pesticide intake in children5. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why is farming important in Canada?<br>  <br>  Canadas demand for food and food-based products is set to double – if not triple – by 2050 and farmers must speak up for their right to meet that demand using conventional farming methods combined with new technologies.<br>  <br>  <br>  “Our world food and fuel needs already exceed our farm resource capacity and it will only get worse as the global population increases,” said Alex Avery, Director of research and education at the Centre for Global Food Issues in Virginia. “Farmers need to speak up about the need to use new agricultural technologies to boost production or we won’t be able to keep up.”<br>  <br>  Not only is the global population continuing to grow, but people around the world are also gaining affluence faster than at any time in our history. And when a population becomes richer, people’s appetites and attitudes change, Avery said. For example, diets change to include more meat, more processed foods and more fresh fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What are some disadvantages of farming in Canada?<br>  <br>  <br>  Productivity<br>  <br>  Proponents of industrialized agriculture point to its superior productivity. In the short term, this yield is possible by expending massive inputs of chemicals and machinery, working over bland fields of a single crop (monoculture). <br>  <br>  However, over the longer time frame, productivity advantages dwindle. In my years working with broadacre farmers in the wheatbelt of WA, it was common for them to remark on how much richer pastures and crops were in their youth. <br>  <br>  Industrialized agriculture thrashes the land, and diminishes its soil life to the point where it can no longer function to convert available organic matter into soil fertility. Productivity begins to wane, and attempts to bolster it with increasing chemical inputs (common advice from farm consultants) has a similar effect to flogging a dead horse. <br>  <br>  Because it relies on living soil to build fertility, the benefits of organic farming for soil life is fundamental to its methods.benefits organic farming soil<br>  <br>  Organic farming benefits food production without destroying our environmental resources, ensuring sustainability for not only the current but also future generations. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cultivation<br>  <br>  While their conventional counterparts may sow by direct drilling of seed into herbicide treated soils, organic farmers are usually at least partly dependent on cultivation to remove weeds prior to sowing.

The advisories conclude that younger people are at risk of accumulating carcinogenic agents in their bodies and harming a developing child, but are not at risk of a heart attack.<br>  <br>  The analysis concluded:<br>  <br>  The benefits exceed the risks for wild Pacific salmon, but the risks exceed the benefits for farmed Atlantic salmon as a group.<br>  <br>  <br>  Children and younger people, especially women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, and nursing mothers should reduce their exposure to the contaminants found in salmon.<br>  <br>  <br>  For people at risk for heart attacks, a diet that includes omega-3 fatty acids is important, but eating salmon that is high in contaminants is not necessary. Omega-3 fatty acids can be consumed in many forms of seafood, including wild salmon, farm-raised salmon from Chile (which were found to contain the lowest concentrations of pollutants in farm-raised populations), and in some oils, nuts, and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Forming plays important role in the development of a county.<br>  <br>  No disadvantages are observed.

rH6dNsR7aa	By the end of meiosis, the number of chromosomes in a cell has been halved. <br>  <br>  The first stages of meiosis (known as meiosis I) are nearly exactly the same as mitosis. The chromosomes in a cell are replicated, they line up along the metaphase plate, and the sister chromatids are separated. (Chromatids are replicated chromosomes that form the X shape that are visible under optical microscopy). During meiosis I, the cell (as well as most other cells in the organism) are known as diploid ; that is, the cells contain two of each chromosome: One from your mother and one from your father (46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs).<br>  <br>  During Meiosis II, the DNA does not replicate as it did in meiosis I. The chromatids still line up along the metaphse plate, and the chromatid pairs are separated from each other, producing haploid cells (23 chromosomes in humans). These haploid cells, called gametes, are then used in sexual reproduction (one from the father, one from the mother) to form a diploid zygote, and thus a new organism.

What is the chance that there will be 2 accidents on the Freeway, on some specified Tuesday morning?<br>  <br>      Answer. The basic rate is r = 1 (in hour units), and we need to find the chance of 2 per hour. Since the rate is simple, it will be included in the Poisson Table. Reading down the r = 1 column, we come to the p(2) row, and there we find that the corresponding probability of 2 accidents is 0.1839, or a little greater than 1 chance in 5. It's not unlikely.<br>  <br>      Proportions<br>  <br>  Coliform bacteria are randomly distributed in a certain Arizona river at an average concentration of 1 per 20cc of water. If we draw from the river a test tube containing 10cc of water, what is the chance that the sample contains exactly 2 coliform bacteria?<br>  <br>      Answer. Our unit of observation is 10cc. If the concentration (r) is 1 per 20cc, it is also 0.5 per 10cc, and that becomes the relevant rate. We can then read off all probabilities from the r = 0.5 column of the Poisson Table. For the specific value of p(2), the table supplies the answer 0.0758, or about 1 chance in 13. Not common, but not out of the question either.<br>  <br>  Arrivals<br>  <br>  The switchboard in a small Denver law office gets an average of 2.5 incoming phonecalls during the noon hour on Thursdays. Staffing is reduced accordingly; people are allowed to go out for lunch in rotation. Experience shows that the assigned levels are adequate to handle a high of 5 calls during that hour. What is the chance of 6 calls being received in the noon hour, some particular Thursday, and thus missing an important call?<br>  <br>      Answer. This result too is easily read off the Poisson Table, from the p(6) row of the r = 2.5 column. The answer is p(6) = 0.0278, or about 1 chance in 36. Roughly 1 per month. How acceptable that is will depend on how cranky the firm's clients are, and the firm itself is in the best position to make that judgement.

For instance, if two visually impaired people have a child, that child is more likely to have have issues with vision if both parents inherited impaired vision from their parents. If this impairment was a genetic impairment than the odds are it would be likely to be passed on. However just because both parents are visually impaired is not a foregone conclusion that their offspring will inherit this condition too. Think of it in these terms.  Both of your parents maybe very short...however one of your grandparents was very tall and therefore you too are tall.  You inherited a trait from a grandparent.  Therefore DNA that has been passed on from another generation can contribute to conditions as well. In addition other external factors may have  contributed to your father's impairment: Extended exposure to ultraviolet lights, poor reading conditions, and other foreign matter.  Extenuating conditions may have aggravated an existing condition or made that condition worse.

Hardy-Weinberg is just about idealized allele frequencies and has strict criteria that are not met in real populations.

bxh1FtnLaa	The first solder that is heat melted on the gold surface has gold particles scavenged at the interface of the joint making a porous, non-hermetically sealed, microstructure.  This structure is visibly duller, has poorer ductility, higher electrical resistance, and worst of all a much lower resonant frequency than a shiny properly fluxed solder joint.  When vibrated, as on board a spacecraft or aircraft, dislocations and micro cracks have a higher probability to propagate and hence the joint might fall apart.  <br>  <br>  Wicking off that first gold scavenged solder then applying a second one makes a superior joint.  The second application of solder does not directly come into contact with the bare gold surface because the previous tin has covered the gold up with an alloy that has a higher melting temperature than, say, the 180C eutectic melting temperature of SN62 (62% Sn, 36% Pb, 2% Ag).

Discrete is something like X = x1, x2, x3, x4 with frequencies f1, f2, f3, f4.  Here you first find the total by doing<br>  t = f1 + f2 + f3 + f4. Then you find the mean by doing<br>  m = (x1*f1 + x2*f2 + x3*f3 + x4*f4) / t<br>  Then you find the standard deviation which is defined by<br>  s = sqrt(sum of (xn - m)^2*fn for all n) / n.<br>  However although it is defined by this formula there is an equivalent one that is sometimes quicker to use.  It is<br>  s = (sqrt(xn^2*fn) / n) - m^2.<br>  For continuous grouped data you use as the x value above the middle of each group.  So if you had heights of 20 to 30cm grouped with a frequency you would use 25cm.

The atomic element of Mg has an electorn configuration of 2-8-2 so if it lost 2 electrons it will now have 2-8, a complete octet.<br>  The chemical reaction could be considered as such:<br>  Mg + .5O2 ---> MgO + energy|`|42d1de7ff8420f02c887feec3a13ae5baa	r u asking us to do your homework?

IJWG1NfZaa	1st law- The rocket will remain at rest or in motion unless acted on by a net external force. So basically there isn't any acceleration going on.<br>  <br>  2nd law - A net external force causes the rocket to accelerate off the launching pad (lift force)<br>  <br>  3rd law- the rocket exerts a force on the gas and the gas exerts a force on the rocket.|`|zR7ZqoxIaa	yes. the baloon rocket is a good example of the three newton law of motion. <br>  <br>  The first law of motion is basically the inertia. if no net force acting on an object, the object will move with its constant velocity. in other words, if there is no net force or opposing force acting on the rocket, the rocket will not change its direction and velocity.<br>  <br>  The second law of motion explains about the equation F=ma. you can say that force is directly proportional to the mass and accelaration, but mass is inversely proportional to the acceleration. therefore, the higher the mass of the rocket, the slower the acceleration of the rocket.<br>  <br>  The third law of motion is about the action and the reaction. "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". this can be explained when the rocket move. the action of the rocket moving upward is equal to the gravity which pull downward. therefore, if a rocket want to move in vertical direction, the rocket must overcome the attraction of gravity before it can be launch from the ground.<br>  <br>  Therefore, in a simple sentence, you can divide the phase of the moving rocket to explain about the three law of motion. in the first phase, you can talk about the first law of motion, where you can explain about the net force acting on the rockets. then, you can explain about the second law of motion, where you can explain about the equation and relate it to the rocket. you can say that the rocket mass is so huge that it requires lots of force to lift it from the ground. the last phase you can talk about the third law of motion. it's when the equal and opposing force acting on the rockets. you can say that the rocket must overcome the air ressistance or the gravity.<br>  <br>  Hope this can help.|`|tVkH44yuaa	for the second law, gravity is also acting on the rocket so it slows to a stop(going up) and then falls down.

2mX8K8bdaa	All atoms have a mmolar mass.  It is given under their symbols on the periodic table.  For example, the molar mass of carbon is 12.00 grams.  1 mole of carbon has a mass of 12.00 grams.  One mole has 6.02 x 10^23 atoms in it.  So, 6.02 x 10^23 atoms of carbon has a mass of 12.00 grams.  Now, take for instance the molecule ethane which has two carbon atoms, and four hydrogen atoms.  Carbon has a molar mass of 12, and hydrogen has a molar mass of approximately 1.  The molar mass of this molecule is (12 x 2 Carbon atoms) + (1 x 4 Hydrogen atoms).  So, the molar mass of ethane (C2H4) is 28 grams per  mole.  So, 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of ethane have a mass of 28 grams.  Try to understand.

This effect is more pronounced the closer the 'opposite' side is to the angle and with the fewer 'angular divisions' you make.<br>  <br>  Imagine dividing the apex angle (A) of a unit equilateral triangle into 4 x 15 degree segments (pi/12 radians.) The height of a unit equilateral triangle is sqrt(3), so the segments on the bottom line created by the inner 2 of the four angles tetrasected at A will be of length sqrt(3)*tan(pi/12) = 0.464... which means that the other two must be (1 - 2*0.464)/2 = 0.0359 each. So the equal angles clearly do not split the opposite edge up equally.<br>  <br>  Contrariwise, imagine dividing the opposite edge up into 4 equal segments. This would mean they were each 1/4. So the angle created by the inner two segments is arctan((1/4)/sqrt(3)) = 8.213 degrees each, leaving 21.767 for the outer angles.<br>  <br>  Final point - if the 'height' of your triangle (the rough distance from the apex to the opposite side) is very large compared to the length of the opposite side, or the number of divisions you make is high, then it will appear numerically that it is varying linearly; but this is just because for small values of x (created by either of the two things mentioned above), sin(x) and tan(x) are both similar to x; so for small x, the variation is in fact linear.

This is because a negative type who repeatedly carries positive children finds their body becomes hostile to them, and a child requires at least one parent to be positive to be positive themselves.<br>  <br>  Although O types sometimes have incompatibility problems with non-O types it is extremely rare for this to be a serious danger to the child,  which is why rhesus incompatibility is the only one you ever hear about.|`|8ftxES2Zaa	▓▓∑?l?P?З▓▓ ????, ???? 和谐 is incorrect.

It has a high likelihood of helping somebody because almost anyone with a positive blood type can take your blood.
