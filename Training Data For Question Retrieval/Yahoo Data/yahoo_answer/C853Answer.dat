Did you change your W4 this year, have less taken out.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Pull out last years return and compare it line by line.  That will show you the differences.|`|UV2V8oBYaa	Take a look, did you make more money this year and pay in less tax. If you have already filed, you can still try using Taxslayer.com and just type in your info above and see what that program says. If it says the same thing ast Turbo tax then is probably correct.    Maybe you had less money withheld this year than you had withheld the year before.
d8BBi3Mlaa	From Sen. Mikulski's site.    The legislation, which Senator Mikulski will introduce Monday, and which she will seek to include in the Senate stimulus package, will help Americans afford a car during these tough economic times, and spur investment in Americas auto industry, one of the biggest drivers of the American economy. Under current law, the interest on a car loan is not tax deductible. Senator Mikulskis plan will change this, making interest payments on car loans and state sales/excise car tax-deductible for new cars purchased between November 12, 2008 and December 31, 2009. This deduction is above-the-line meaning it can be taken by both itemizing and non-itemizing tax payers. The plan is targeted so that only families making less than $250,000 a year, or individuals making less than $125,000 annually, qualify for the full deduction. Under this plan, a family would save about $1,553 on a $25,000 car, and about $2,500 on a $35,000 car. For more information on Senator Mikulskis proposed legislation, go to: http://mikulski.senate.gov/_pdfs/Press/a...|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	you bought it in 09' then why would you get a 08 tax break. seems to me you would get a 09 tax break, IF ANY|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	It is NOT a fact yet.

If it is, then you would just file some kind of amendment to your tax return to get the rebate. Once it is passed, they will give info on how to get the rebate if anything else is needed.

However, your employer (if you get your health insurance through them) did not purchase one of those plans.    What's covered is determined by the plan you (or your employer) purchased.    Sorry, but you have to take this one up with your HR dept. (or who ever purchased the plan).|`|qBCGH52haa	Some do cover those types of things once.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Mine does.     If you're looking at a group policy, for more money, the employer can choose to cover it.     If you're looking at an INDIVIDUAL policy, well, the smoking is a PREEXISTING CONDITION.  Plus, you KNOW smoking means more medical expenses, right?   So you're PAYING more, because of the increased likelihood over nonsmokers, of bronchitis, asthma, lung cancer, the like.  But they don't cover the products, because, well, you could PAY for them out of your cigarette money, and if you're financially invested in quitting smoking, it's one more reason to quit.  Plus, it's a preexisting condition.

Let them know of the double charge. Normally they will just credit this amount back to your credit card. If they give you a fuss about it/do not refund the amount back to your credit card. Go to your local bank/credit card dealer and let them know of the problem. They will be able to handle it from there. Good Luck!!|`|nopHdd9Kaa	Call your credit card company and refuse the second charges.  You can also contact the seller and talk to them and say that you have been charged already.  They might be able to issue a refund.  It would also help if they need it to send a blinded copy of your credit card bill where you black out the full number but leave the last 4 digits to prove that it is the same card that you payed with and any other things that can be used to steal your identity.  Leaving your billing address would be useful to also show that it is you who ordered it.

Fish are not going to get out of their bowl or aquarium and damage an apartment or disturb the neighbors.

"No pets" usually refers to animals that may be dirty or run around and somehow cause damage to the place. A fish obviously can't do much damage. But its better to check with your particular landlord just to be sure.|`|fFzF8qP8aa	Often pet's will generally include animals that could potentially make a mess, make a lot of noise, lose hairs, cause odours and things like that.

9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, Warm this winter,  Gabriella Cilmi
C0tYtelFaa	You would think that most companies would be happy with you sending them something.  Honestly, you may have put yourself in worse trouble by making what is called a "token payment."  These small payments help to keep your debt current (in the eye of the state's statute of limitation on collection of debt).  They reserve the right to call you if you are not making at least paying the minimum amount.  In your case, if you are able to work out some other sort of agreement with them, then great.  How old was the debt before you started giving them $5 a month?  If it was significantly old, you may not have ever needed to pay anything in the first place.      To your second question...    Companies are allowed to contact 3rd parties to obtain information on your whereabouts.  However, they are not allowed to disclose any information on your personal finances.  For instance, they cannot say, he owes us 10K and you better tell him to call me today... They are not allowed to do that...  Now, there is not much you can do to get them to stop calling your friends or people from your past.    The only thing THEY can do is send a cease and desist communication letter to them.  If they continue further, the people can file harassment charges against the company and agent in particular..    Sounds crazy, but there is not much recourse you have for a 3rd party.. Hope that helps..    Feel free to e-mail if any questions..|`|1HLPznZhaa	Sounds to me like they are skip tracing you and if that is true it is legal to try to get as much information as they can.. You are being asked to pay 1200.00 a month and you want to just pay 5.00 ? Are you kidding ?? You better contact the party you owe and try to work this out or you could be on the losing side of a law suit,,|`|4cJZ3SIWaa	No they are not obligated to stop. This is not a telemarketer. They have a valid contract that you and they agreed to. You promised to honor this contract and they have a right to collect. Eventually if the amount if large enough, expect a lawsuit and either liens on property that you own or deductions from your paycheck.|`|ncgjvX8uaa	Get the name and address and write a letter to them telling them not to call you anymore. Google Budd Hibbs and read about his "cease communication" letter.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	What TransUnion is probably doing is contacting each listing on your credit report to verify which ones are legitimate and which ones are false.  This could easily take 30 days to have them get all of the information, then what ever time it takes for them to put everything together.  So it could be anywhere from tomorrow to a few months.    Having your score or report suppressed is not going to be seen as a positive thing with the lenders.  Now, if only your score is suppressed, but your report is visible they may look at that to at least pre-qualify you.  That is a long way from actually getting approved.  If your report is also suppressed you can probably show them an old report but it would have little to no weight in even pre-qualifying you.    Depending on the outcome of this investigation you may need to look into if there are any actions you can take against this "repair" company.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	It sounds like you hired a crooked credit repair company.  What do the other credit bureaus show?|`|EeJMITyCaa	I don't know the answers to all the questions. What I do know is that no bank or lender is going to let you show a previous credit report. They want to know what youre doing now. Not what you did in the past. Heck three years ago I had a 750 now I got a 569 and trying to rebuild it. So you could see how that wouldn't benefit the banks.|`|1HLPznZhaa	I hesitate to answer this.. you might need to seek legal council on this mess.. If you have a bank that knows you I would start there..
3vHGjuBgaa	Unless the Where's My Refund page is saying that you have a direct deposit tomarrow, Feb 6th, then you will not be getting a deposit tomarrow. My daughter's WMR page said that she would have her refund by Feb 10, then last night it finally changed  and said a DD was scheduled for 2/6. It is already showing as "pending" in her bank account as well.  So if your status still says Feb 10th on the WMR page today, I would  not expect my refund tomarrow, I would expect it next Friday on 2/13.....you probably will not get a status update until next week as well.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	excuse me! i guess that's not the answer you wanted to hear,although it was what you asked.....................    good luck with getting your refund.i got mine already     HA!!!!|`|znr8SBiWaa	If you were getting a deposit by 2/10, it would be direct deposited tomorrow, and it would indicate on WMR that your refund is scheduled to deposit.  If you filed Monday, you would most likely get your return next Friday.

7lmtBhdMaa	They check to see that you made your payments on time. If you are just building a credit history don't make a late payment (not even 1 day) Paying off a loan early isn't good either. They just want to see how you handle your bills. Don't overdraw your checking account and never, never, never leave a bank hanging (oweing them money) and don't leave the Government with your Student Loans. You won't get your Income Tax Refunds back until you've paid off your loans to the Gov.

If you have a Federal Reserve bank near your location they'll cash it free of charge.  Unfortunately, many banks are far to careful when it comes to cashing non-account-holder checks.  Many of the RAL checks coming in are easy to forge as well which can result in major headaches for banks.  You may want to check the IRS site to see if they offer options for cashing the check as well.  And hell, I'd even check the post office.  Good Luck!    Peace!  The Reverend    UPDATE:  After answering I went back to read more member answers...amazing that so many are asking why you don't have a bank account.  For those of you who don't know, it is quite easy to get turned down for a bank account.  If you've ever bounced a check and it was recorded in telecheck or alike's system, you have a hard time getting a bank account.  There are some banks that don't check telecheck but most are not aware of what they are.  With banks handling money the way they are as of late, I'm not surprised that many are pulling their money out of the banks.  Furthermore, who are we to judge this person for not having an account.

dRezbY31aa	There is no one best plan; if there was that would be the only plan available. Medciare plans can get very confusing and there are no simple answers.    You have a choice between a Medicare Supplement or a Medicare Advantage plan.     Medicare Supplements have several different options: plans A through L. Not all companies have all plans. Plans F, J, and G are the most popular. All plans are regulated by the government and are exactly the same (except for premium) between companies. None of the Supplements have drug coverage so you need a separate Part D plan but it doesn't have to be with the same company.     There are many types of Medicare Advantage plans, such as an HMO, PPO, PFFS, MSA, SNP, PACE or Cost plan. These plans are county specific and not all plans are available in every county or from every company. Most of these plans have drug coverage. Some plans without drug coverage will allow you to purchase a stand-alone drug plan (again, it doesn't have to be with the same company) while other plans do not allow a stand-alone drug plan.     With a Medicare Supplement you have a higher premium but little if any additional costs when you use medical services. The Medicare Advantage plans usually have a lower or even a $0 premium but you will have co-pays when you use medical services.     Visit a local agent that works in the senior market and with all the major companies. The agent can sit down with you and explain the differences in the plans available and can help you choose which plan is best for you. There is no extra charge using an agent.|`|BovpXrk1aa	AARP|`|y2ZukikXaa	I think Zarnev is stealing my line now, but yes if there was a 'best' then there'd be only one.

But call a tax advisor and see if they will just let you ask thier opinion about the situation!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If she is LEGALLY married, her SS  would give that away. File married but separately.|`|ximb5bCxaa	The name thing does not matter. She probably should just claim by herself since his SS  is attached to the past child support that he owes. She should claim single with dependent as long as she had some sort of income. If not then let the aunt claim the baby AND her since she did live at the same address. DO NOT LET HER CLAIM WITH HIM because they will take all of her refund. Although later she might be able to file for the injured spouse exception, it just takes a long time and paper work to file with the IRS.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	these are common situations and if you don't know the answers maybe the taxpayer should consult a pro. The Aunt thing is illegal, Her filing anyway but MFJ or MFS is fraud. Try Injured spouse. Name change is no big deal, women choose to retain there maiden names sometimes..... She needs someone who knows taxes.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Whether she changes her name is not the issue.  If she is married, she must file as married:  either jointly or separately.|`|af84982f31783516125917ce375c63c0aa	It doesn't matter if she has changed her name or not.  You can always either file as "married filing jointly" or "married filling separately.  I would consult a CPA for how to file since they have a dependant child.

She is providing your info as a child care provider on her taxes so she can get the credit. Most employers dont pull taxes from your paycheck if you make less then a certain amount ( 200-250 dont remember) but you would still have to file. regarding those that said dont how would they know... it really depends on how worried you will be about getting audited. She is providing your info to the irs...that is how they would know, but if it is under a certain amount then you may not need to. Just be sure of what the amount is she is claiming she may claim higher than actual to increase credit amount... providing her with a statement could give some protection. call irs and ask for more security.

Don't go in with a defeated attitude.|`|KF5pitm8aa	I beg to differ! An employer knows a great resume when we see one. Looks are not the  1 thing that employers are looking for, unless you want to be a centerfold or a pole dancer.     It is true that we are looking for employees with a good personal appearance, but that is a fancy way of saying "good hygiene". If it looks like you need to be introduced to a toothbrush, hairbrush, shower, etc. then you will probably be turned away for a job.     If you have a good job history and solid references, don't worry.   Many of the "young pretty things" that have worked for me were either cokeheads, boozers, or welfare mamas who were terrible workers because they had always had everything handed to them on a platter!

There will be no issues if you do this.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Its really no big deal, you do not cash or use the money if there is a refund do to you, this is what is said on the IRS website. If you get more of a refund you are allowed to spend more. Redo your taxes and file the ammended form, see what the differences are, if you now owe you simply submit payment as directed. You are only in trouble if you do not do this before april 15, or if you touch the direct deposit or check before they have a change to deal with it. You can call and get help filling in the paper work over the phone. As long as you take the appropriate steps as mentioned above you will be fine, yes it can hold things up. But since your adding such little income and paying them what was owed if any, or writting them a refund you should be fine, call the IRS its like a 20 min hold no biggie and they do help annonymously so nothing will start a hold up from that phone call unless you agree to provide info to get more info.

dRezbY31aa	All legitimate companies will underwrite you for the pre-existing condition unless it's for a very limited defined benefit plan. However, just because one company declines that doesn't mean all companies will decline. What each company will do depends on the company, the condition, sometimes the plan you are applying for, and your state of residence. Depending on the condition some companies will accept you but not cover the condition. Other companies will accept you but charge a higher premium to cover the condition. Other companies will have a separate deductible for the condition. Also, companies can do any combination of the above.     Since companies and regulations vary by state (and you didn't mention the condition) there is no way anyone here can recommend a company. Visit a local agent that works with all the major companies in your area. The agent can find out your options with the various companies and can find the best plan for you if one is possible. There is no extra charge using an agent.|`|y2ZukikXaa	A cold can be a pre-existing condition.    Cancer can be a pre-existing condition.    High cholesterol can be a pre-existing condition.

In regards to the question about increasing rates.  Yes, they can change rates until you sign the lock in agreement.    Interest rates change everyday, sometimes every hour.

b81H0vlYaa	I have quite a bit of idle time, partly because I am able to finish my work very quickly.  The rest of my work really is just waiting for something to go wrong.  I get bored and make-up projects of my own.  Sometimes they are remotely useful, and sometimes they never get used.  I do I.T. stuff and basically anything that needs to get done that is not already delegated to other people.  I also do container tracking and put together forms/spreadsheet and do research.  I also volunteer myself for other things, and am currently learning someone else's job here just to do it.      I did feel guilty, but my boss knows my position slow right now and he says I am doing a good job.  I have a web design and graphic company for myself and I work on that a lot.  They always ask me what I'm working and, so I tell them.  I recently found this thing call Yahoo! Ask...yea, now I'm kinda addicted because it feels like I am accomplishing something helping people with questions.  Simple Pleasures, I guess.  I also email a lot of my friends.    Please note that before I took this job, I didn't mess around, I worked non-stop even without taking breaks, so this is not my nature at all!  I had 0 idle time.  I have/love to stay busy.  I worry sometimes that they may not need me here and I am just waiting for a layoff, but if something goes technologically wrong, or they need something created, then they would be hopeless without me. It would cost them more time and money to send a computer to get fixed, than it does to employ me.

8xMhLMoRaa	Well how you are paid is pretty insignificant to be honest. You need to contact citizen's advice as they will be able to help you with some professional advice. The point is, if you are kept on a retainer, you will be unable to claim Jobseeker's Allowance so you must find out as soon as you can where you stand with your employer. Is there any way they an relocate you to another location within their company? Or perhaps allow you to take on some short term temp work while the renovations are being done? If this is something you want to do, you need to let your current employers know what is happening as you may violate the employment contract if you take on another job.    As far as severance pay goes, you will probably not get this since they are not severing your employment. If you choose to leave because of this situation, you will be in essence resigning.

NrvrH4zQaa	For 2009, the standard deduction for married, filing joint is $11,400.  The 2 personal exemptions (you and your wife) are $3650 each ($7,300).  So, you pay no federal tax on the first $18,700 you earn.  If you work 52 weeks at 40 hours per week at $8 per hour you will earn $16,640 and assuming your wife does not work, you will owe no federal tax.  You may owe tax to the state of Ohio, but I'm not up to speed on their rates.    Edit to add - You will pay Social Security and Medicare tax on everything - together they are 7.65% of your pay, so effectively you earn $7.39 per hour.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	You'll probably take home $220-$250 per week.|`|qtHFJFvQaa	you'll be taking home about $5 to about $6.5 Per hour|`|pfjxEZBmaa	How many exemptions are you claiming on your w4?

The more dependents you claim (up to 9) the less you will be taxed, however, if you claim fewer dependents the more you will be taxed. When claiming dependents please use discretion because when filing your taxes if you have claimed a large number of dependents during the year so that you take home more money and at tax time have no dependents to claim you will probably end up owing taxes instead of being due a refund.

Seriously, what you need to do is do some research on the company, and take an interest in the Employer. Let me give you an example:    Couple of years ago I went for a job and I knew very little about the job itself. I found out a bit about the Employer and spent most of the interview getting to know about him, how he'd started and made the guy feel like he was on top of the world.Basically I wanted him to see that I was interested in the job, the company and that I was easy to get on with. After the interview he told me I could start the next day and he wouldn't bother with the other chaps.   Second, you want to make yourself stand out. Thank the interviewer for interviewing you, shake him by the hand and look happy.  As for the job itself that you're referring to, a wire bonder/ assembler usually works on a conveyer belt assembling small fiddly circuit boards, using a soldering iron to attach very tiny components and that's pretty much all you do all day. What I would do is tell the employer that you're interested in learning more and that you would like to partake in a night time course after work at your local college in order to be a productive employee.  I think you will be able to bs your way through it!By the way if you know very little about the job, I would stress that you are a keen learner as if you try to blag that you know what the job entails and they ask you questions, then you will look like a dic and you won't get the job. Good luck!|`|HmiFGACXaa	If you do not know what they are talking about, you won't have the 1 to 2 years experience that is preferred.    Odds are you will not get the job.|`|goe3y4FPaa	take it easy.. and just let them teach u.. or talk to people who already do this job.. and ask them for recommendations i would just find someone who has experience in this job.. and have them as my ''mentor and learn evrything from them''|`|5rQWrpyGaa	If you don't already know about the job then you're probably not qualified.  Usually, if you have 1 to 2 years of experience, then you already know enough about the job to appear knowledgeable in the interview.
FPDsDBSUaa	I have that same issue and it seems as if they have a P Freeze on your refund. They are actually reviewing your refund and will issue a CP05 letter stating they have 3 weeks from the letter to request more information or to release your refund within a certain amount of time. I requested a tax payer advocate to rush the process since I have a hardship. I went ahead and submitted proof of everything I claimed in my return so that they will release my money asap. She told me they have 1 week from the request she sends to respond or she escalates it to management. Long story short. We are being review but not yet into audit. Our refund is on freeze until its resolved and you need to get a advocate to hopefully rush the process. Good luck and lets keep each other updated.|`|iAXnTZAmaa	I am in the same boat.  Just called the IRS and the rep could not tell me what the exact problem it.  How frustrating.  She said that a letter was mailed, but I was told that last week.  Where the heck is it????|`|SEwqwjPkaa	The 1121 error code means:  1121 Problem identified; P-Freeze IRM 21.5.6.4.23, P- Freeze    Essentially, a problem has been found with your return and it has been frozen pending resolution or error correction.  The agents at the IRS live support line rarely know what the exact issue is but surely they can tell you that there's a problem.  I would think.    Hope this helps!  Peace!  The Reverend    P.S.  Also, don't trust the WMR site...it's been on the fritz and even the agents will tell you this...if you get the right ones.|`|KHOsfLM9aa	they are revieing your file, they have 7 weeks.|`|Uxivl7UXaa	1121 is a p freeze which freezes your refund until they collect the additional information they want. Unfortunately they tell you a week for the letter it actually takes 2 weeks then after you receive the letter they still have 3 weeks left to either ask for more information or release your refund. I have been reading and its happening mainly to people who the maximum EIC refund or who claimed the first time home buyers credit. But don't feel like the lone ranger in this I have also been waiting for my letter and money to be released and well its now 2 weeks still no letter or refund.|`|aBRDy1q4aa	My return was accepted on 01/18, got pushed back a week than last week I had an actual dd date of 02/06, which of course my money never showed up. Now WMR says delayed and the code 1121. Just got off the phone with the IRS and she told me it is being held and is in review, not audit. They are checking it manually for accuracy, I will recieve a letter in a week or two. Just plain ridiculous. I have filed HOH with the same children for years.|`|d2269f54b8dbee56a19cdc96e1036798aa	Hey all welcome to the unlucky group!   I too am one that was told they direct deposited my refund the on the 30th then the 4th and now I have 1121 code now...   I was told yesterday the problem was fixed and then today said it was being reviewed and wait 4 the letter.....   so idk   lets keep each other posted..
KHOsfLM9aa	no|`|pJFYp8Mtaa	You should sign the return if you are filing jointly with another person. But, you don't have to be present. Your partner can bring the forms, envelope, etc., home and you can sign them. Then they can be mailed tomorrow.|`|Gem96NQyaa	No, but you do both have to sign it before it can be filed.
wig4qCeJaa	Recruiters are paid by the employer, and they love to send you on interviews so they look good, and you get nowhere.    Job Consultants, on the other hand, are paid by you, but they are expensive, and they generally teach you how to look for a job and how to conduct a good interview.    I think what you are looking for doesn't exist.|`|5rQWrpyGaa	Recruiters are hired and paid by the employers to find employees for them, not the other way around.  What you are probably looking for is a staffing agency that works with many different employers.  You can look them up in the phone book or on the internet.|`|AA11895859	well i'm a pro and i'd sure like to recruit you for some umm yeah job and oh what a job it will be mmm hmmm     where the hell have you been? same place as me?  muahz|`|6uHSGjU2aa	As a candidate you'll find the best recruiters by word of mouth. Carefully ask around who is good and specialises in your field.    But if you are a employer looking for to hire a recruiter than sites like www.recruitercritic.com help you for free and usually have some kind of generous incentive program.    Alternatively, have a look on job boards and find the recruiters that have the most listings and contact 2 or 3.|`|BwZJXbSjaa	i need  a sexslave        you jumpin outa my cake for my bday babby?|`|ICLekd2Vaa	try laders. $100k+ jobs for 100k+ people.     or theres always careerbuilder. you can set it for automatic email notices.
WsMXhqcZaa	Yes. You would take the NSF check, the signed documents with you when you sue her in small claims court. She will lose.|`|AA11215123	If her lease is with you them you can sue for certain. But the landlord is the one with real standing because she wrote him an illegal check.|`|0iMgW6Skaa	Why would you want to sue her? She changed her mind-big deal!  perhaps she had a logical makeover and decided for whatever reason It was not right for her.
OeLQPhaWaa	There are many methods used to track inventory such as:    Portable hand-held scanners - used for manual inventory counts.    Point-of Sale (POS) computer systems - each item is deducted from inventory as it is sold.    Purchase Orders and Shipment Invoices.    GPS tracking devices - used on tractor-trailers to track shipments while enroute to buyers.
JPDxyTT3aa	its not so bad. offices can be so much fun!     yesterday the new office manager was having some major mud butt- she was stinking up the womens bathroom so bad. so on her third trip i put the door wedge on the door from the outside and trapped her in her own stink. she was in there for about 30 min before someone let her out, in which case everyone knew she had created the stinky in the bathroom.     prior to this i came into work a few days early and taking that little tab from those Annoying singing birthday cards and after unscrewing his electrical socket and sticking it in and screwing it back together, returned to my office just as people started coming in. it was pretty funny watching him crawl around on his hands and knees trying to figure out where the birthday song was coming from in his wall.     Pranks are the most important part of being in an office. They help to keep everyones sanity carefully intact. So pull out some ductape and cling wrap and get to work! If all else fails Y!A and online shopping get me through the day.    oh and the girl above me that commented: is a stick in the mud virgin.     LMAO|`|6rXyaUAoaa	Wow - a lot of people would like to have such a "boring" job.    As far as the little F game - it's downright crude and I wonder what type of place you work at.    Maybe you could think of something constructive to do, such as something to improve this company who so kindly pays you to F___ and be bored.    If so, maybe they will promote you and you won't be so bored.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	You should photocopy your butt.     I would go outside and smoke.|`|TasV2KaRaa	RUSSIAN ROULETTE CUBICAL FARTS GAME???   LMAO!  ALLRIGHTY THEN!  idk try...youtube....diner dash....chat rooms?
GJKWgx0Paa	one of the same columns commented that President Bush had exactly one issue with one appointment -- and that one was that a prospective appointee had given shelter [free housing] to an illegal immigrant.    Well, this is "Change" isn't it?|`|1553f5a78b13fec0789c55dcb9d0d0a3aa	No.  Is he a ******* mind reader?!  How was he to know.  How about you blame the people who didn't pay their taxes.  They could have told him long ago.  But did they?  NO!    Troll.
HypqcnJaaa	Wait, wait... Let me consult my crystal ball.|`|3EBKrVrDaa	Most likely the assistant manager or something would get promoted.|`|5e4192d684cd7ce865e36c9c44a4352caa	Are you second in command?  Do you have the qualifications, on paper, to qualify for the job?  the experience and education?  If you do, then as soon as he gets fired put in your resume for the job.  It will be easier for them to hire from within a person who already knows the company.|`|A15bfvkBaa	If you earn it then yea you should.    Good Luck anyway.|`|Z9aEClXnaa	if he gets fired and you still have a job there then there is a chance there might be a job opening for his spot. if there is you can apply for it. if they accept your applying to his spot they would talk to you and just like applying for a new job you would wait a little while and see if you got the promotion,|`|BVFv8SlPaa	mabey|`|5rQWrpyGaa	It depends on whether or not you're qualified to do his job.  Usually they will promote an assistant manager, or hire someone from the outside.|`|6IZ30X8iaa	no - they'll want someone from the outside with completely clean hands|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	if you had something to do with him getting the axe, i would not worry about being promoted, i would worry about looking behind my shoulder all the time looking for the axe that fired him will be stuck into your back
Z9aEClXnaa	do you have ay experience with pets,    why do you think you would like working here at petsmart, how much you might want an hour or sometimes they choose. and do you have a record. they will most likely do a backround check on you. are you good with customers, and do you get mad easily, and so on. good luck with your job interview.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	In your opinion, is there REALLY 'more than one way to skin a cat?'
EsYfnOrkaa	That depends on what you have in writing from the lender. If the lender locked in you rate based on your application, with your credit score known, I would think not. However they could have had you sign something that said they could, or they may not have a signed lockin with you just their word.  Welcome to the world of untrustworthy lying cheating mortgage lenders, banks etc. Some are and Some aren't!!!  You should have your agent go to bat for you to get the lender to reverse their decission to raise the rate.|`|AA11173563	no once locked that is it unless the lock expires. that is the loan officer who forgot to lock fault|`|23SkYEw5aa	you keep answering this question and the answer is the same.      RATES CAN CHANGE AT ANYTIME until you sign the actually "Loan Lock In Agreement", which you haven't signed.    Interest rates change everyday, sometimes every hour. Plus your credit score is only one factor. Your payment history could be another (remember the late rent payments?).
5rQWrpyGaa	Once they recieve the resume they typically call with in a week.  But if they are recieving a large volume of resumes it may take a little longer.  I'd say that if you don't hear from them within 2 weeks then they're probably not going to call.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	You would get better results if you applied at local offices in person.  Everyone uses the internet so they are over whelmed with resumes.  Unless the company says to submit a resume online, doing it in person is much more impressionable.|`|pNy8lakjaa	You don't wait for their call.. YOU CALL THEM!    Show how bad you want/need/desire to work.. and lo you will get hired by showing the initiative.
z8BGODBIaa	It depends on what state you live in and the owner of the Cold Stone you want to work at.  I can't work there until I'm 16 :/|`|ptQBetAnaa	u cnt apply 4 a job til ur 16+ i kno it sux!|`|lY1uPhmMaa	haha i want to work there to im going to be 16 in march haha u jsut gave me hope|`|CecQFtDvaa	ya im pretty sure you can at 14 so your old enough  have fun|`|sV3vVYVVaa	yesh u can|`|LhT5WqMgaa	when your 15 but you need a permit, with the hours you'll get it's not worth it
AA12093096	I think it was because you were declined for the 1 to 2 days, alot of people are being declined for the RAL, because it's requirements are extremely strict this year.? Anyway, you have to wait for the regular 8 to 15 business days like everybody else to see a deposit on your emerald card.? I think they still charge you something too, so you probably would have been better off filing on a free tax service on the internet and getting it in 8 to 15 days. maybe try it next year.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	According to the H&R Block website, to get money in 2 days, you would have had to apply for a Refund Anticipation Loan.  The 8 to 15 days is the estimate of how long it will take for the refund from an e-filed return to get on to your Emerald credit card.  You have to pay the fees for e-filing, and whatever they charge to activate the Emerald credit card.  And if you think you applied for the RAL and don't see the money in your credit card account, then you need to call the office where you filed and talk with them.  If you DID apply for the RAL, you will be charged the interest on that loan, as well as any e-file charges and card-activation fees.

5rQWrpyGaa	Go to monster.com and use their resume builder.  Basically you'll want to include your education, work experience, special skills (i.e. computer skills, public speaking, etc.), and any special recognition or awards that you've received.|`|Qi0H6DkTaa	My recommendation would be to prepare one yourself.  Use the internet.  It is a great resource.  I actually made my first one at the age of 16 also and I used a Microsoft Office Template.  They are very easy to use and they give great examples of what should go where.  Because you are 16, I would encourage you to use a lot of school activities on your resume.  I'd imagine you don't have much work experience.  Babysitting counts; it shows responsibility.
U7nj9Kg4aa	Home insurance is typically manditory for homeowners if they have a mortgage (meaning they MUST get it...doesn't matter if it's a recession or not).    Auto insurance is manditory to legally drive anywhere (meaning they MUST get it...doesn't matter if it's a recession or not).    Death, serious illness, and disability have absolutely nothing to do with a recession (meaning they will happen whether you have insurnace or not and whether it's a recession or not).    IF you have $100,000 in investments and things are going great and you need to write a cheque for $50,000 you have nothing to worry about.  But during a meltdown like right now when you're $100,000 investment is only worth maybe $30-40,000 and there's a chance you might lose your job and you have to write a cheque for $50,000 you're in some serious trouble.  When do you feel insurance is most valuable?  When the problem is affordable, or when the problem is more than you can afford?  If you can't afford the premium how can you afford the problem when it happens?  As I mentioned, the problems isn't going to wait until the recession is over, it will just happen.    Short answer:  business is great...always has and always will.  Infact I've sold more in the last 6 months than I sold in the previous 12 months.  The need for insurance never goes away.  If only adjust how majorly important it is from time to time.  If someone tells you it's a bad time to get into the business then they are a terrible advisor and that has nothing to do with what the market is doing.

hGqPNI9paa	The courts are the final deciding factor.  If the late fee is not stipulated in the contract or part of a standard rental law in your state, then it should not and could not be charged.  If you are 100% sure of your position you can contact a lawyer and if you are unhappy with your current lease or location you could use this as an opportunity to break the lease since the landlord is potentially breaching the contract.      The unfortunate part is that the late fee is probably so small that taking it to a court is not cost effective.  If this is a monthly issue then I would look for legal means to get what you deserve.  The other "alternative" measure is that you can, actual rules vary by state, deduct costs that the landlord did not compensate you for things like repairs.  You need to use the "common sense" rule and if you are 100% right then I would consider deducting it from your next rent but you have to be ready to fight back when he tries to evict you(which requires a court appearance) that way you put the problem back on him and if he wants the balance of the money he needs to foot the court bill.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	In CA it does not have to be in the lease.   However, there are state laws on the amount he can charge you.    It depends on your rent.    Take your rent amount, divide by 30, this is the amount, per pay the landlord is allowed to charge.   He can not charge you more then that.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	if its not on the lease it wont hold up in the courts unless he stated it to you before you took the apartment|`|CvSmraPUaa	no the landlord can not charge a late fee if it's not on the contract you would definitely win this in court.

Pjm9pg7iaa	The interest rate on the 10 year Treasury bond has the greatest impact. If that rate is 5%, investors will not loan on mortgages unless they receive 7%.

U7nj9Kg4aa	Wait for a statement to come in the mail.  You should receive at least an annual statement or a letter form the company at one point or another.    The other option is if you know what company she would have dealt with (or which ones she might have), call them.  While there isn't a central database for all insurance companies each individual insurance company will have a database of their clientelle and should be able to find out who her advisor was and get the process rolling for you.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	You just wait.    If you're asking, is there a central database, the answer is no.   No agency collects that, there's no website to look it up.     BUT, if there IS an active, paid up life insurance policy, she would be receiving a STATEMENT on it, once  a year.  So be sure the executor of her estate forwards the mail, and just sit back and wait for the statement to show up.

"Stupid" or not, it's the only measure that a reputable lender will use when evaluating your application.    And - that you are even asking about Borrowing money for a *deposit* tells me you really don't understand how financing works.  Borrowing for a deposit is illegal in some places, and unethical everywhere.  If you need a 0% Downpayment loan, then apply for that.  But I guarantee that the "stupid credit scoring" is going to be an obstacle you won't get around.

Paying that off will greatly improve your standing.    Look at it this way:  - The three late payments say "this guy is sometimes late, but he seams to get things paid."  - The 1500 owing says "This guy couldn't come up with 1500, AND STILL CAN'T! How the heck is he going to afford an entire house?!"
ShWaAY7maa	Hi there     This is what i would do: Call my lawyer and talk too him/her about what you are going too do, Another thing by any chance did you mail your invention too yourself first class registered mail. if not i was just wondering if you had did this.   because you have a patent pending i think you are covered so that big company's can not come in and take your idea, now they can make it better then what you have made it if you allow them too see what you have made. because the big company's have a lot more money then you do. Me myself I would only show it too the company's i was going too deal with only. because its going too put on the market for everyone too see it any how.deal with the ones first then if you are not satisfied with there money offer, then look for other big fish that will bite. Good Luck    Hope this helped.
0JoWTQWoaa	Due to your high income and making the assumption the entire 18,000 is qualified expenses and you have two or more kids, you would get a child care deduction of $1,200.  It would go against your tax liability. Without any additional details, I could not give you an accurate amount of what you would get back.|`|7jDyJRLyaa	If you use Turbo Tax, that's one of the questions they ask and get you everything owed to you, BUT you have to have the daycare provider's state or federal ID number.  I highly suggest trying Turbo Tax.  got me a ton of money back two years in a row.

Give them a call and ask.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	No, it is really from one rental period to the next.   It does not matter if the period is 28, 29, 30 or 31 days.   You do not owe any more.    Of course that is assuming you are out by Feb 28.   If you are not, yes you owe the rent.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	are they known as hard asses?    when the lease says "30 days", they are entitled to 30 full days and any shortfall can be taken from your damage deposit.    ***  why did you wait until there would be a question?  providing 5 or 6 full weeks notice would have been nicer to them.|`|23SkYEw5aa	No.  The number of days in a month doesn't matter.  As long as you are out of the place by Feb 28, you will be ok.|`|AA10974989	A 30-day notice generally means one month.  If your lease terminates on February 28, you pay through February and vacate the premises on or before that date.

kGJND4lYaa	Okay, here's the way it works.     You need to file, whether you think you'll have trouble or not.  If one online site doesn't work, try another. I suggest TurboTax.com because H&R Block sucks and will always suck. Maybe not as badly as your parents, but they suck nonetheless. And yes,  the IRS will accept your return even if you are delinquent on previous years.    As for the previous years, since you "barely made any money", it should be very simple to go to www.irs.gov and download the past-year's versions of the 1040-EZ and file that by mail. Again, you NEED to file the paperwork if you made over a certain amount, even if you are owed a refund, because it's the law. And breaking the law gets you in trouble.    And if a couple hundred dollars is "such a small amount" to you, I will do your taxes for those years for free if you give me the refund. E-mail me though my profile page.
bFRVSDteaa	You should always use the current filing addresses.  The "where to file" link on the IRS web site directs you to use Fresno for "all individual taxpayers filing their own Form 1040 during Calendar Year 2009" from Illinois.    Elsewhere on the IRS web site, there is a note which says: "Some addresses may not match a particular instruction booklet or publication. This is due to changes being made after the publication was printed. This site will reflect the most current Where to File Addresses for use during Calendar Year 2009."  This is why you should not use the old address printed in the original 2007 instructions to Form 1040.

Also don't wear too much make-up and make sure you hair looks nice because during the interview they will be looking at your face the whole time. So clean make up and nice hair and also no holes in your shirts or pants.|`|BP6N0ALBaa	no u need to have a dressy nice shirt and maybe for your pants either wear a skirt or wear pants that are dressy?
Cnfngqf3aa	Yes Forex currency trading is real. It is the trading of money between different types of currency as the price of each fluctuates in hopes of making profit. It is only for serious investors and its NOT a get rich quick scheme. I have had experience trading in the Forex market for over 4 years now. You need to do your research before you jump in to anything.     When I first started, I knew little about trading so I purchased trading bots, or EAs (expert advisors), that automatically trade my accounts for me. With these I would closely monitor their actions which helped me become more aware of the signals and signs I needed to watch for while trading for myself. Forex trading is much different than trading in the stock market because signals in the stock market are more easily identifiable. In Forex there are so many different things that affect the price of a currency that it is nearly impossible to interpret. I have acheived most of my profits using various EAs throughout the years. I found that a good EA might only be profitable for about a year or less, after that I move on to a new one. Also, I usually use more than one EA at a time on different currencies; just make sure they don't interfere. You must be sure you are using quality EAs, because you could easily lose all your money with bad ones.     What I would recommend for all beginners is to open a mini account with a Forex brokerage (mini accounts usually have a $250 minimum), and use this account to practice and get a feel for things. I reccomend using MetaQuotes trading platform, it is free for download at metaquotes.net. As far as EAs go, there is no "best one" out there. I linked below to one of the EAs I am currently using that has been my most profitable for a few months now. The second link is to the 2008 Automated Trading Championship where you can see proof of how much money can be made trading Forex, it will also give you good leads for finding profitable EAs.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	most new traders lose some, all, or more than all of their capital within the first two years -- according to one well known trading researcher.    and Forex is likely one of the worst about that, not one of the best.|`|uT20yra3aa	My advice would be to learn a little about the Forex market and how to trade. You can set up a demo account and practice your trading without risking any of your own money...it's just like play money or monopoly money LOL!    If you want to try out any of the programs that claim to automatically trade for you try them out on your demo account that way you don't risk any of your own money. I personally don't like the auto trading robots like FAP Turbo since they automatically trade for you and I like to have control over my trades. It just sort of freaks me out to think of a program investing my real money but did use it on my demo account and it performed well    I use Forex Ambush 2.0 which gives me the power to execute the trades myself. Do it on a demo account...if you don't like it or if it doesn't perform for you get your money back...simple
xGNnD5Ghaa	well for one, being fired and quitting are the samething, you can't get unemployment for leaving a job, or for being fired cause you sucked at it. a lay out i think is the only way for getting unemployment, or not being able to work. For the most part he can still get a job if he quits, or gets fired, i think it may be better to quit, and say he hated his job, or he felt it wasn't the right place for him. if he gets fired from a job its not like every job he applys for is going to go on a background check and go "Oh he got fired from so and so, We cant give him the job." Componies are to buzzy to look up every persons backgrounds beside crime and age, and even if that is the case, its always if the job feels your the best person for it and people who go to jail for years can still get good jobs, but only if their work hard at it like everyone else!!  I say flip a coin, and go for it!!  good luck i hope for the best for you.

pJFYp8Mtaa	Spend the money on a tax preparation service. You'll probably have some deductions for interest and any work-related expenses. Turbo Tax does have a line item deduction version, but you may be better off having a tax prep do it this year. Then get yourself a tax book and take a tax prep course at the local community college. You'll save the cost of the course in the first year's tax.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	If you've made less than 10k, you shouldn't have a problem getting the max refund.  I think you'll qualify for the EIC credit, and probably some others that I made too much to ever qualify for.      You can also use any student loan interest paid in your favor.  Go to H & R Block's website and use their free filing service.  It will guide you through all the available credits.  It's really easy to use, and more importantly, free for the federal.
GJKWgx0Paa	you fight by going to the HOA Board and asking where's the money going?    If you don't like the answers, you continue the fight by getting elected to the Board.    ***  I've served on an HOA Board before -- it isn't huge fun.    ***  And your purchase agreement was 'subject to' the HOA dedication and rules, so you've already agreed to pay -- which is why they'll slap a lien on you within a few months at most and, in some states, end up seizing the house and selling you out of it.|`|AA11173563	this needs to be addressed at the meeting and get as many neighbors to sign a petition to do away with it since it does nothing at all or find out what they are doing with it but no you just cannot stop paying as they will place a lien on your home in a blink of an eye|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Good luck keeping the house.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	$240 per year is probably just about what it's costing to provide insurance on the common areas.

You can't get out of an HOA on your own, but you can participate in your HOA, because you are an HO. You can attend meetings! You can canvass the neighborhood! You can run for office! You can persuade the other officers to change the fees or spend on services!    And who knows, once you establish your dominion over your neighbors, you might look at that filthy lucre paid by 5000 people each year and start to imagine how to spend it for services and such.    Well, if you aren't up to it, then just demand an audit of the HOA from its treasurer.    HOA's are odd devices. I know of one where the old biddies hassle everyone about nitpicky appearances, all the while they ignored the maintenance of the pool houses, and now those pool houses are condemned. So, both pools are locked down and the communal property us unusable.

That's why it has historically has been so easy.  You are refering to a letter of credit which you can tap as needed. The only bank that would consider that is one that you have used for 10 years.  They can take a look at your history and make a quick decision.  Otherwise you are left with family members to help you thru a tough time..

Also you will need to be insured and pay taxes on your income.  You should also be licensed, bonded and insured. Since you will be walking other people's pets, do you know animal first aid since you will be totally responsible for them in your care.  If you are under 18 yrs old, you can not sign any contracts with your clients if they insist on one.  A contract will protect both you and your client.  An attorney will tell you what you need to do, so consult one to keep everything legal and you out of court!

When you have the fees withheld from your refund, your money first goes to their partner bank (HSBC or Block Bank, na) to have the fees stripped.  That will typically take a day or so.

That will take one banking day at least, plus up to 2 or 3 banking days for it to post to your account depending upon your bank's posting procedures.|`|Gu856ETGaa	When you let someone else take fees out the refund goes to them first so they can take out the fees and then it goes to you so yes, it might take a few days extra to get from them to you.

They use to require they be 2 weeks old before they would actually insure them.  If you have your own insurance coverage and your husband's is covered by another and you plan on placing the baby under your husband's coverage the yes, tell him to at least talk to them and let them know.  Under your insurance policy, which I am assuming you are using for the birth, you are covered then it gets sticky,  Of course if everything goes well and you have a natural delivery, you and the baby will go home within 24 hours.  If you have complications, you are covered but I have seen cases where if the baby was born with something wrong with it the insurance company falls back on however the policy is written.  I've seen several policies written wherein the newborn is not covered for 48 hours up to six weeks old.  YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR INSURANCE POLICY FIRST AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT COVERAGE OF A NEWBORN.  Of course, I'm sure all will be just fine with you and your baby and yours husband can put the baby on his.  Insurance coverage and policies are different depending on the insurance company and the policy you are paying for.  I'm pretty sure they won't cover a child prior to birth nor do you have to have a social security number for the child at this point.    BOTTOM LINE CHECK WITH BOTH OF YOUR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND FIND OUT|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	You cannot add them, until you have a date of birth.  As soon as the baby is born, you notify the insurer of the "qualifying event" and have the baby listed without the social security number, if they'll let you.  Some will insist that you get the social security number first, in which case, you need to get something from them that you DID notify them that you tried to add the baby within the first 30 days, and as soon as you get the SSN, they'll honor the request to add the baby - even if it's past 30 days.   Then as soon as the social security number is issued, you have the baby listed.|`|9FxR4khCaa	Generally, you have 30 days after birth to add the baby. It is not possible to add the baby before birth, because it is not born and the insurance will require proof of birth-possibly the hospital issued birth certificate, medical records or a certified birth certificate from your county records dept. You should check with your carrier or HR Dept before the birth to find out what they require, so that when the tim comes, you know how much time you have to add the baby and what they will require as proof the baby was born. As long as you are also confined with the baby in the hospital, all those charges are covered under your coverage. Once you are discharged, those become covered under the baby and you will need to add the baby for those charges to be covered.|`|9QhP6JpDaa	I would think after because what if the baby has complications.

In a nutshell, since the property is in foreclosure, the lender that holds the mortgage has to be satisfied ( paid off) per the terms of the loan.  You as the Buyer will get a new loan;  that money goes to pay off the old loan that the Seller has and you start the 30-year  cycle again, paying off the mortgage (loan).  Good Luck!    However, an example of where you might pay the homeowner directly is if there is no mortgage on the property ( therefore no foreclosure either).

5BTKscZraa	In spite of the seriousness of this situation...unfortunately no, mental illness is not a valid excuse to void out debts.    SSDI cannot be garnished for credit card debt. Your friend is "judgement proof" as long as she is on SSDI and has no real assets. Even if her creditors took her to court and won a judgement, they'd be powerless to have it enforced.    Don't even think about filing for Chapter 7 for this small amount of debt. Filing would cost near $2,000 and she is not in enough debt to justify filing.  Be sure that her creditors are aware of her SSDI status...that would discourage them from taking legal action.  I'd offer to settle the debt for $1,000.     * Get all terms of any settlement deal you reach with debt collectors IN WRITING BEFORE you give them your money. This letter should state the settlement amount and that the account will be settled/paid in full upon receipt of this amount from you.

Never accept settlement deals over the phone without following up with a written agreement...If you dont, the debt collectors will deny that any settlement was ever made once they get your settlement money and will come back demanding more money.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	Sounds to me like a good case for a lawyer to handle if she's basically not a "responsible" person.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Her only option is to stop paying.

You can choose a percent or a dollar amount.    If you just have your items listed as a buy it now option, I don't think you can put it on sale, but you can edit the listing and lower the price.    A few tips for selling better:    - Make sure you have the keywords someone would use to search for your items listed in the title and double check the spelling.    - Make sure you take good pictures and having extra helps.    - You can use Auctiva (if you're not already) to create and post your listings. They have hundreds of templates to choose from and they let you add lots of pictures to your listing for free. And Auctiva is free.    - Be sure and include details in your description. Size, color, measurements, condition. Checkout similar item listings that look good and imitate what they are doing right.    - Make sure you have your items in the right category.    I've also discovered how well things sell is often a matter of timing. I wish you the best - cheers!|`|M7QdxEQ0aa	Sounds like you are new to ebay and selling a high-fraud item.

a3d8b420f040b6eabcf2e68c4cd15b44aa	First off, I would avoid World Wide Brands like the plague for (at least) two reasons. First, I consider their advertising to be, at best, deceptive. Their material boasts "over 4,000 brand names." This is meaningless, as most general wholesalers carry a wide variety of "brand names." Remember, you aren't looking for "brand names," you're looking for "sources." Secondly, their 'membership' and recurring fees are wildly out of line for what they provide.    As for "wholesale lists," most are simply junk. They are usually lists of "snail mail" addresses and (ususally disconnected) phone numbers that have been floating around the Internet for years and are completely out of date. In the wholesale field, companies are always opening, closing and merging. So, if you're contemplating a list, make sure it's as current as possible, like the ALL-BIZ WHOLESALE SOURCE DIRECTORY. It has over 800 direct links to wholesale sources. They also have a directory with over 100 Drop Ship Sources. Both directories are updated twice a year. ALL-BIZ has recently been acquired by Deals On Demand. You can get information about them at: sales@dealsondemand.us.    Another great source is (believe it or not) the AOL Yellow Pages at: http://yellowpages.aol.com/. Type in "wholesale" and your zip code or the zip code of a major city near you. As an example, I did a search for Grand Rapids, Michigan. The search returned 271 local sources in 36 categories.    You can also try the Thomas Register at: http://www.thomasnet.com/. It is the most complete listing of manufacturers in the U.S.. You can search thousands of manufacturers and send them emails through the site.

So if you bought a Hummer H2, then you incurred a bunch of taxes. That is when you save all of those recepits.    Also saving certain receipts is good if you telecommute or are self employed.    Another thing is if you have a year with a large amount of medical expenses, then saving all medical receipts can pay off.

sby0C51haa	Yes you can sell it the day after you bought it if you want to, the catch is that the mortgage is still owed in its' entirety and you will have to pay it off as soon as you sell the timeshare. If the amount you owe is greater that the amount you are able to sell your timeshare for you will need to come up with the difference to clear the title for the next owner. Good luck on the sale, it is almost impossible to come up with a sale that covers your original purchase price if you bought from a developer.        Timeshares can be sold but the resale value is terrible, if yours is a good one (location, season, size of unit, etc.) then it is easier but it will never sell for half of what you paid for. The average prize that I have seen them been sold is for no more than $2000, and this is for completely paid off timeshares.  There are so many options out there and you are right several owners would just give them away, that it will be almost impossible for you to find someone to take over your payments or give you a good amount for it.  You might want to talk to your accountant about defaulting on the payments.    These are some options:    - Resale is most likely not an option unless you sell it to a friend or relative.  - BE VERY CAREFUL if someone offers to sale it for you and ask for money upfront, they are just a bunch of scammers.  - It is ok to pay a few dollars (no more that $30) to post an ad in some really good site. There are some FREE sites that you can advertise, and my advise is that you just give it away and let someone take over your payments, you can try these:    http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/  http://craigslist.com  http://ebay.com  http://recycler.com/  http://usfreeads.com/  http://www.inetgiant.com/      - The last is the more painful, talk to your accountant about defaulting on the loan.

Second, you'll need to create an e-commerce site (online store).    For reaching new clients, the best (and incidentally cheapest) way is through facebook. Create a group on facebook related to your products, including pictures and other information that they might find interesting. Send it to everyone that you know on your facebook account. Make sure to include a link to your online store site in your facebook group.    MySpace is also a good idea.    It'll spread to more people than you can imagine. Quicker than in any other time in history. You're lucky. Social Networks are the quickest way to send spread information in history to date and your target clients are the largest users of Social Networks. It's a golden opportunity.
2sXqm4u9aa	You legally cannot drive a car without insurance but people do and think they won't get caught.  Home insurance just places the homeowner at risk of losing a major investment and being sued by someone who get's hurt on their property.  I think it sucks that hard working people have to find ways to buy the basics.  Insurance is usually not considered necessary for survival.  Our economy sucks and insurance costs are rising.  What do we do?  My husband just died a few months ago and he had life insurance with wal-mart since 2001 and had to go on leave of absence and after 1 year leave if you cannot return they will terminate you thereby making you have to convert medial to cobra, pay out of pocket for aflac or whatever benefits you had as well as pay life insurance premiums and dental.  I was able to convert to cobra and aflac but they (after numerous calls, complaints, discussions, lies, etc., did not send me any information or exit package as promised and when I called, after they said I had 90 days to convert, the woman at prudential laughed in my face and told me we only had 30 days.  We did not drop life insurance since he had a terminal disease.  The company put so many obstacles in our way and then fell back on their laurels.  I could not pay premiums if I had no knowlege of where to send them.  The people are not always the ones cutting back, the insurance companies are re-evaluating what they are willing to pay for and dropping the people.  ITS SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Because they can't afford it!  People are losing their jobs, their homes!  Of course the insurance is the first to go, it sure as heck ain't the food.    But as you mention it, it shouldn't be the first to go.  People want to hang onto their last bastions of luxury (e.g. cable, bottled water delivery, newspaper, cigarettes, etc.).|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	OK, I'm sure I'm going to go off on a tangent here.      First of all, the life insurance policies will probably be the first to let lapse.  From a "financial decision" point of view, if there is a mortgage or loan on the car, it's very shortsighted to let the insurance lapse on those - forced placement coverage WILL be put in place, at 5X to 10X the price - meaning, the car or the house WILL be reposessed.    The REAL BASE problem here, financially, is that peope bought houses and cars they couldn't afford, with money that wasn't theirs.  They were living on a shoestring, and when the littlest thing goes wrong, the house of cards collapses.  PEOPLE ARE LIVING BEYOND THEIR MEANS.   They are thinking in terms of "monthly payment" instead of COST.      Why did our grandparents - and greatgrandparents, for some of us - avoid debt like the plague?  WHy did they settle for raising 6 kids in a three bedroom house 1000 square feet?  Why did they ever only own ONE car to a family?   WHY did they save 20% OR MORE, of their income regularly?  Because they saw what "outliving" did to their families, during the great depression.     As long as people insist on making financially stupid mistakes - like borrowing tens of thousands of dollars for assets that depreciate faster than we can pay them off - or hundreds of thousands, for assets we plan on NEVER paying off - they are going to get into trouble.     Housing prices falling - those are natural market corrections.  People can STILL get loans for cars and houses - with good credit, and a down payment to assure that they aren't "upside down" on the loans.      Encouraging people to spend, spend, spend - whether through marketing, or "bailouts", is NOT going to fix the problem.      I warned you - tangent.  But educating people about finances, is going to require them being willing to LISTEN.  And they aren't, still.  So things are going to get worse and worse - in general - until people become willing to take the cotton out of their ears.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	one reason is money.  right now the economy is really bad and people are losing their jobs.  people have to cut backs on things and some people are desperate.  i let my health insurance go and i'm ill.  i lost my job and there was nothing i could do about it.  i continue to have to cut back and it's just depressing.    the other reason could be irresponsibility.  the people that fall in this category aren't responsible and it shows in their actions.|`|nxN8YMAFaa	A lot of insurance policies advertise on their strenghts without disclosing their weakness.

QoVL5cDHaa	Your ex-employer could be in the manure here. Did he deduct NIC contributions? And did he ask you to complete form P46 when you started there? If so, any potential underpayment is chargeable on you. If not, on him.  You come from Canada, which is in the British Commonwealth. So you will be entitled to the British personal tax allowance of 6035 tax-free. To establish your residency and your allowance entitlement, do form P86, which you can download from http://hmrc.gov.uk, and send to tax office.  What worries me is the earnings elsewhere. Pay As You Earn tax is calculated on a cumulative basis, so you are only entitled to personal allowance of ten months at the moment (5030) up to 5th February. The tax year goes from 6th April to 5th April.  If you are intending to stay and work longer in the UK, when you send form P86 to tax office send form P45 from last job, and any others, or details of other earnings. When you start a new job, correct cumulative code number can be sent to that employer.|`|FI4Z0jYcaa	If you didn't work prior to this job, you should not be in arrears with regards to Income Tax (you are correct that you are entitled to 6,035 tax free allowance), but your employer should have made deductions of National Insurance (as this is calculated every time you are paid).  Did you receive any payslips detailing how your wages were calculated?    Without that, it sounds very much like you were working "cash-in-hand" so your employer could avoid further tax and you will need to contact your local Inland Revenue office to inform them and ask what your next course of action will be.  If they require payment of National Insurance, it will work out around 240 (if your wages were the same each week).    Apply for a National Insurance number from the DWP (0845-600 0643). This will help the Inland Revenue keep track of your pay history.|`|8ut0e6BDaa	i shouldn't think that you would need to pay tax, but its probably worth going to your tax office to check.Especially if you are planning to stay here and continue working,

IWbFqtQ3aa	a driver license or a passport or if you don't drive you can get an id from the driver's license office.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Ummm...well, it's an ID issued by the government.    On a national level, a passport is considered government-issued identification. On a state level, a driver's license is a government-issued ID. For people who don't drive, many states issue identification cards that contain a person's photograph and other identifying information.    Certainly, if you work for a federal agency, you'll receive an identification badge and that's a government-issued ID.    Things that are NOT government-issued IDs are IDs issued by private companies or IDs that you can get at some photo store. Also, usually some document without your picture (such as a birth certificate) is not considered appropriate ID.    There's a gray area with IDs issued by schools. If you go to a public school and have an ID with a photo issued by the school, that's sometimes considered an official ID.    Hope that helps.|`|FgFmj8d2aa	A government issued ID is any form of photo identification issued by a state or federal government agency. Most common ones would be driver's license or passport. Military ID, green card, government employee ID, if any of those apply to you, would also work.

Maybe you should consider getting a student loan that is large enough to help you pay off your other debt, since most student loans, you don't have to pay interest until one year after you graduate.    I don't know about filing bankruptcy. I know it seems really hard, but you've got to learn how to budget your money and stop spending on crap that you don't need.

RvddYKqjaa	Remember you don't just pay back the $2000. There is interest to pay also, and depending on the company, that can be quite high. The longer you take to pay the money back, the more interest you will pay for the right to use their money. They will usually tell you what the minimum payment can be.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	You'll need to provide the interest rate, length of loan & how the rate is computed.|`|Au32tyxGaa	At what interest rate?

A common credit card company would charge 20% annually.    So, if your annual interest rate was 20%:  your monthly interest rate would be (20% divided by 12 months) which is 1.67%.  Therefore on a $2000 loan, your monthly interest would be 1.67% of $2000, which is $33. But keep in mind, this is ONLY the interest. If you only pay $33 a month, you are ONLY paying the interest which means you still have to pay the initial $2000.    I would never recommend you only pay the interest, no no no, always pay more! Or else, it's like you're on a treadmill, you'll keep on paying interest and you'll never pay off the initial amount!    For 10% interest rate it would be $16.50 per month (only interest)  For 5% interest rate, it would be $8.25 per month (only interest)    Again, if you only pay the minimum, which is the interest, you'll never be able to pay off your debt. Never pay the minimum! Always pay as much as possible.    Also, If you need a little income on the side, check out this online program. I'm currently a member and I have to say, it's a small price to pay for financial freedom!  http://www.themaverickmoneymakersprogram...

(Yah it's hard, but at least they will still have jobs.)      You can also consider cutting back on your hours of business...say weekends or Mondays.  Move as much as you can to internet to cover those days.  Have customers send e-mail requests.    Read your bills closely, sometimes there is a minimum that you can pay and keep services. Make payment arrangements with companies that allow.   (Call everyone to find out if you can do it.)  Try not to use credit cards because interest rates are crazy high right now.

meK0ziCJaa	It doesn't matter that you are now caught up with the payments, the past can not be changed...so to speak. What I would do if I were in the situation, is take any documentation that I had to the credit union and try to get those late payments reversed. However, it sounds like you weren't late with a payment, you missed a month. Maybe if you explain the circumstances behind the situation, the credit union will fix it...especially if the customer service representative that you spoke with is working there at the time you went. It's easier to take care of these issued in person than it is on the phone, at least I've found that to be true. Also, being nice gets you farther then being abrupt. I know it's hard considering what's at stake here.     However, if they do not reverse the late payment, it will not go away on your credit report. Only time will remove those marks. You could dispute the negative marks with the credit reporting agencies, but if the creditor validates the debt, it's for naught.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	uh o- its always harder to get things going back up .

H17L1WW4aa	Oh the feds would love it.  Here is the problem, mortgage backed securities are sold on the open market.  The Fed, Congress or President cant waive a magic wand and pick what the rate is going to be.  Its all about supply and demand.  There is trillions of dollars in the mortgage market.  The Fed really hasnt got involved in buying them before.  Their thought is if they throw 300-700 Billion at that market.  The amount of money they push in will create a supply problem and rates will lower.     Technically it makes sense.  But what if mortgage backed securities drop to 3.5%.  Why would an investor buy something that has risk for 3.5% in a mortgage back security when they can buy a Government Bond paying the same.    So large companies and governments might say the reason we buy them is because it pays 2-3% higher then the US Bond Market.  That 2-3% is worth the risk of a Mortgage Security.  Why the hell would they take a risky bond when they can have a guaranteed US Bond for the same rate.  The answer is they wont.    So the US Government will have to guarantee them like they do US Bonds if they want it to get down to 4%.  I just dont see any other way it happening.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I would sure like to see that pass.  Sure was happy about my $7500 tax credit for buying a house this year.

0JoWTQWoaa	You can not compare your tax refund and tax situation to anyone else.  Everyone's tax situation is unique. The main reason for the difference is you are in a higher tax bracket than she is.  Another difference is in the way you fill out your W-4. She may have claimed single 0 and you may have claimed single 1 thus having more taxes withheld than you. She is not getting anything back but the money she paid in. There is no way to tell why she is getting more than you.  You are not doing anything wrong.    In response to your additional details, the money you are getting back is your money.  The goal of tax planning is to break even.  When you get a big refund you are giving the government a tax free loan.  You could have had the $600 the entire year.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Because you are comparing apples to oranges.  Her refund has no bearing on yours.|`|qBCGH52haa	First, you are most likely in a higher tax bracket. Second, you would have to compare the withholdings - her employer may have withheld more on a dollar--to-dollar basis.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	She may have more of a tax credit.. Just because you make more doesn't mean you get more back.|`|fLqDrdFYaa	you still do better then her whts an extra 600 dollars when u made 20,000 more then her|`|LeaUjOoUaa	She could be in a lower tax bracket and so has less taxes to pay. Also when she filled out her W-4 she could have had more money withheld from her checks than was required, making her return more. You didn't mention if she is also single with no dependents but obviously if she has children or a spouse, that would change her levels of deductions. If she owns a home she could get a deduction for this and it would also affect her return. Making more money should in no way be a reflection of how much of a tax return one receives. Usually the higher the income, the less chance of getting a return.  Try looking at it differently. If she gets more back in taxes, that means she paid in too much money throughout the year. All of that money that goes to the IRS and is returned, the IRS got to use interest-free. The best outcome when it comes to taxes is breaking even. You owe no more and receive no return. Think about it, your return is basically just money from your paycheck that was withheld each month. So your friend not only has the misfortune of making less than you, but the money she does make on each pay check is even smaller because she is overpaying to the IRS. She would be better off reducing her with holdings and take the difference and put it in a savings account. At least that earns interest.|`|0tFia0nDaa	everyone knows the more you make the less you receive back,, esp as a single person with no dependents|`|ximb5bCxaa	The reason is because she makes less than you! The government tries to do the robin hood thing....give to the poor by taking from the not so poor. It sucks really. Either way, she is taxed on less and therefore she gets more of her taxes back at the end of the year. Taxact is great I use it too...it probably isn't wrong. Sorry.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	You are lucky enough to make $20k more than her and are crying because she got a little extra? Not to sound rude, but get over yourself. You are in a higher tax bracket and have no dependents. Does she have kids? A parent she has to care for? That all figures into a return. Everyones situation is different. And if you aren't having taxes taken out at all, then of course you are going to have a much smaller return. She may also make less than the threshold to qualify for the EIC, which will indeed give you a larger return.    ADD: You're a ***** and know nothing. I have paid my own taxes since I was 15 years old. I'm pretty sure that covers my sons childcare assistance. I still pay almost half out of pocket. You're precious taxes aren't paying for my sons childcare, mine are. I work 40 ******* hours a week to support a household on ONE income and make less than 25k a year. I get no child support from the so called father. So go **** yourself you rich *****.

You won't get another husband like him.    FIRST THINGS FIRST    The county is usually a big organzation.  Is transfer possible?    The mental damage lingers on from verbal abuse and sometimes is permanent.  From what you describe, the effects could become physical.  You can only fight this so far especailly when the abuser holds the position of power.  My guess is he's fought her for awhile and finally he's breaking down.     Unfortunately, when you're being forced out of a job (that sounds like that's what this is) there's not much you can do.  You can go to his supervisor, but if her boss likes her it's falling on deaf ears.    It's nearly impossible to take legal action unless there's discrimination or sexual harassment.

JnzLl2VIaa	I've had employers call me anywhere from a day to 3 months after I applied. Here's why:     - Some employers need the job filled NOW, and will call you ASAP   - Some employers hire on a rolling basis - they wait until they have a certain number of applicants and pick the top 3 or 5, to make sure they're interviewing only the best applicants on the market  - Some have hiring "cycles" - they put ads in a month or two early for positions they intend to hire at certain times throughout the year. For instance, my company hires in June and December.    Your best bet, as with any job application is to wait about a week, and call their HR department to follow up. Tell them how you applied (ie monster.com) and ask them when you can expect to hear ack, since you're evaluating other job opportunities and you'd like to be able to make the best job decision. Believe it or not, that simple tactic can bring your resume to the top of the pile.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Yes the above poster is right.  Wait about 5 days then call them up and ask if they received your resume.  This will do 2 things.  It will give show that you are genuinely interested in the job and not just sending out random resumes, and it will also make it more difficult for the HR person to throw you in the trash.
6rXyaUAoaa	Not good to call.  After 3 weeks or so you might just to see if the position is still open.    Many recruiting and HR people find it pushy and intrusive to get calls like this.  Also, you can look really desparate and by the phone.    Best to let it take it's course and assume that the will contact you if they pick you a a YES resume.    If you have a first interview, then it is appropriate after a week or so to call and ask "what stage of the interviewing process" they are in and is it possible to see if you are in the stack for a second interview.    Email is better - try to get the email address of the main interviewer.    Good luck!|`|5rQWrpyGaa	Wait at least a week after sending the resumes, but then you can call and say that you wanted to check on the status of the resume that you submitted.|`|5Ar2NRCXaa	i will wait at least 3days, before calling them.
I6vMxEU9aa	Yes a certificate is different than a degree. I have both. My BA is in communication studies, but because I didn't like any of my options for minors in the liberal arts school within the university I attended, I opted to get a marketing certificate in their business school. The degree is more comprehensive, but the certificate carries much more weight than a minor (but is not quite a major). I found that having both at graduation helped me get a job because I was familiar with both liberal arts and business. But you can always get a job with just a certificate although employers will think more highly of a full degree.|`|LXiBCERZaa	certificate = much faster, cheaper, not as respected, you won't get as good a job making a lot of money.     degree = Takes longer, better education, expensive, you'll get a much better job and make more money.

BoAEgaAGaa	If you work and earn over $400 as an independent contractor you are required to file an income tax return.  An independent contractor is a person who works for someone who does not withhold taxes from your income.  In this case you would have to file a Sch. C, to report your income and deduct any expenses you have receipt for that you spent on earning this income.  Then you would complete a Sch. SE to compute your Social Security and Medicare taxes.      Bottom line is that you would owe approx. $212 for these taxes if you have no expenses.  You would not owe any federal income tax since your income is this low.  You would file a Form 1040 to report this income and to complete the proper schedules.

Some employers do say under the table but they claim you as an expense, so it is important to know if they are giving you a 1099.
AQxZQv7paa	People who say Primerica is a scam either don't understand the business or they are Primerica's competitors. The fact that Primerica has competition proves that Primerica is not a scam.    Anyway, the first thing you should know that Primerica is a business opportunity. That means you are your own boss and you can build your business as big as you want and the company will pay for it all. The only thing they won't pay fully is getting all your licenses. The first license you are going to get is a life license. The real cost of getting a life license on your own would cost you around $300. At Primerica, you only have to pay $99 and the company will pay the rest of it on your behalf. This is where most people fail to understand why they need to pay $99. This $99 is not a Primerica fee. Its a state licensing fee. So that's why several people think Primerica is a scam.    The next licenses would be the mortgage license (which may be free in your state) and then the securities license (which you get reimbursed for after meeting certain qualifications).    So what to expect if you join the company? I'm going to list the good and bad:  THE GOOD  1) You will be recognized for all the hard work you do. You may find it weird because in the corporate world, you are recognized for all the mistakes you do.  2) Get tips and hints from successful business leaders in Primerica on how to build a successful business  3) Product training  4) Feeling proud and positive when you help families  5) Ability to earn overrides and bonuses  6) The company will always be there for you when you need help on something or need questions to be answered right away or when you are facing complaints from customers.  7) You will develop leadership skills  8) If you work hard enough, the company will reward you with company trips (believe me, you don't need to do much to win these trips. If you help at least 2-3 families per month, you have good chance of winning)  9) When you become a Regional Vice President, you have true ownership of your business. You can sell it, pass it to your family when you die, or keep building and promote RVPs.    THE BAD:  1) Friends and family may think you are crazy and may try to avoid you (though I can be totally wrong and they support you 100%. My family doesn't support me at all).  2) From time to time, you may lose focus and just want to quit  3) Not everyone will do business with you.  4) Not everyone you recruit will do work and some will quit.  5) It takes time and hard work to see results. This is not a get quick rich scheme.  6) You may have this fear of rejection stuck in your head, so it hampers your ability to go any further in your business. (just accept that people will say no to you. You have to keep searching and you will eventually find a yes).  7) You will stray away from the basics of building a business and go into management mode and wonder why your income is not growing.  8) The world really don't want you to succeed in life and want you to quit. (But why should you let the world set your future? Only you can control your destiny.)|`|qiMmKeqwaa	My son got all excited about an interview with them.

I worked for them 8 years ago and don't expect to have money without hard work.    If you don't have patience to talk with customers, call them, go the meeting etc...and you don't have a passion for being a finacial advisor/insurance salesperson, the business isn't for you.

If the money is needed to pay for necessities fine, but generally there is some to spend on wants. I'm telling you this from experience, having received disability benefits from SSI myself.

So if a stock has 1,000,000 shares outstanding at a price of $10 its market cap is $10,000,000 ($10 x 1,000,0000).    If 100,000 shares more are issues then the price of the stock will be $10,000,000 / 1,100,000 = $9.09.

q1MC7dsDaa	It is not illegal for the credit card company to "authorize" those charges in general.  However, it would be illegal for them to "authorize" those charges knowing they were fraudulent.    Proving that a credit card company knowingly "authorize" fraudulent charges is not impossible but would be a difficult task.    This blog can help you better understand your rights: http://you-theft.blogspot.com/|`|MvVd0ayCaa	I believe that knowingly keeping that money would constitute theft by definition. It is money that does not belong to you, and you know it.    Also, even if you don't get charged with theft, the credit card company would likely have the right to retract the amount at any time (as in, after you've spent it and can no longer afford to pay it back) if they discovered the inaccuraccy in the future.    So you are probably better off notifying the credit card company immediately.
c9d5f331f9cbde50771decf142111a51aa	A few factors. Are you claiming yourself or is a parent claiming you? There are several things to remember Everyone has a personal exemption one time, so if someone else claims you, you loose that. The standard deduction also applies, every one has that but it may be different due to your age. The EIC is available for this income if you are over 26 years of age as well. These things all factored together may result in the difference.|`|Wch2WybQaa	It has to do with deductions.  When you are a dependent (i.e. someone else has declared you as a dependent on their tax return) then you cannot claim yourself as a deduction.  Without the deduction you pay more taxes (i.e. less of a refund).
EeJMITyCaa	Number one. He is a jerk because he is trying to pressure you into making a pyament. He is trying to pressure you. Trust me they've tired it on me too but unfortunatetly I'm got used to being pressure since I'm in the military. If you show them by not backing down that you're not going to pay it in full they will change their mind. Also, unless that debt is 6 years old and about to get taking off your credit report in a year, no credit company is going to accept 1000 bucks. The lowest they will accept is about 60 percent 1501 about but even that is a sretch. If I were you I would offer 70 percent if it is newer that 2 or three years. They should take it and if they don't then tell them what you told them. That you were hoping to settle for whatever 70 percent is because you have the money but if they don't want to you can pay another company. Also, make sure you get something in writting saying that if You settle they will forgive the debt and take it off your credit report. If they don't want to do that then don't pay them anything. Also, some collection companies will try to get you to pay with a debt card or try to get you to tell them your bank account information. Tell them you wont do that but you would be happy to mail them a check. On the check in the "For" line make sure you write something like "Cashing this check constitutes the forgiveness of the full debt and that it will be erased off your credit report" so if they don't do it then you can take them to court since you will have a copy of the "contract" on the check.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Not sure of your question..Are you asking what percentage rate you should pay on   $ 2,502.63  ,or if you can offer a lower payoff figure..If you are going to pay in full I would try to negotiate the payoff..|`|meK0ziCJaa	The collection agency will only settle for a certain amount. This amount is usually non-negotiable, they will give you a figure that they expect to be paid in full (no payment arrangements here). If you agree to the settlement amount and fail to make the arranged payment, the settlement will no longer be valid and you will owe the original amount.     Depending on where you live, the fees that you were charged could have been from the original creditor. It's probably outlined in the terms of the agreeent you executed.     It seems like from your description of the conversation you had with the collector that everything seems legit. You may not like the options, but it is what it is, unfortunately.     Also, even if you do pay it off and it is credit reported the account will most likely not be removed from your credit file. This is a major misconception among consumers. The data reporter is obligated to report correct and accurate information. If this means that the account has been paid, the trade line will say "paid", or something to that effect. If the account has been settled the trade line will read "settled". From what I've read for my own credit, settled accounts could reduce a consumer's credit score. It's almost better to pay the debt in full and have it read as such than have it settled on your credit file.

BXwv4dBvaa	You would be looking at getting a copyright for your "style", and yeah, it's expensive.  To do this properly, you should speak to an intellectual property lawyer.  I'm not sure that you can claim decorating ideas as your own; but you may be able to apply under the "artistic" category.    I believe you are in Canada, so I have included the link to the government of Canada's intellectual property office, which outlines the application process and provides all the forms and outlines the fees.    With a quick scan, the fees seem to be reasonable too.  With your worst case scenario, you would be looking at > $200 if you were to do it all yourself, but again, it would all have to be done correctly and accepted under the "artistic" category.

0yqQg9CXaa	Fox News has reported that online scams are up 400%  Be careful what you do online -   especially if you are looking for easy money.  /|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

AA10143348	Q1 Yes, the examiner would say that ABCG is not disclosed by the prior art but that since claim 3 of 001 is ABCE and claim 2 of 002 is ACF, that it is somehow obvious to make ACFE.  But if the prior art says B is important to getting F to stick....then the examiner might be wrong.    Q2  You need to get a license from the owner of 002 because you want to make ABCG (their invention) and add H to it.  Having a patent doesn't protect you from being CHARGED with infringement.  Getting a patent allows you to charge OTHERS of infringement.  Even if you got a patent, you would still need to get a license (unless 002 is so old that it is expired or if the owners dont pay the "maintenance fees".    You are also making ABC, which is covered by claim 1 of 001.  So, you need a license for that too, if that patent is still in force.    Q3  Generally the answer to this is no.  But if I is very much like G or would make G an obvious substitute for I then the article might make 002 invalid.    Q4.  Again the obvious answer is no.  ...but you would need a second license, because now you want to make ABCE  plus G H and ABCE is covered by claim 3 of 001.|`|VjgqZetcaa	In addition to first answerer's reply (which is quite good), you might also consider, under Q3:  If element I is like D, E or F, and it predates patents 1 and 2, it could be used to invalidate those earlier patents. Contrarily, if element I is unlike G and H, you could have patent 3 "reexamined" in light of the further art, and let the patent examiner determine whether the patent is still valid, or actually stronger.  In any case, while 3 is pending examination, the applicant has an obligation to disclose the old journal article to the examiner.

Native American  Hispanic or Latino  Asian/Pacific Islander  White, not of Hispanic Origin  Black, not of Hispanic Origin  Mulit-racial    They ask for this inforamtion for EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) purposes.  However, employers cannot require you to give this information.  They can request it, but it is purely optional whether or not you complete these questions.  They cannot require you to give your race, sex, or age (date of birth) for anti-discrimination purposes.  If any employer is telling you that you have to give this information, then they are breaking the law.|`|KF5pitm8aa	You are never required to give out information based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, etc.  Employers are not allowed to discriminate based on this information, either.

Isn't working towards advancement of colored people specifically racism?    I am white (or so I am told). I always check other because it screws up the demographics and it shouldn't matter.    Any time we hire to reflect the population means that if a highly qualified white person applies, but the company doesn't have enough minorities they need to not get the job to balance the racial make up. That is racism.     Any time a person gets preferred treatment or is discriminated against because of the color of their skin, it is racism.|`|oiOtOD0Taa	No, it's not meant to be racist. It's usually in there for equality reasons - to show they are hiring an appropriate proportion of minorities that is relative to the population.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Don't think is racist. But certainly reflects ignorance on whoever designed classification.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	You sound a bit above yourself. Each states application process is different, due to state laws. Each state asks different questions on their applications and have other requirements verses other states, so no...it would not be the worded same. No, it is not being racist, and if you are as smart (as you mentioned), than this would not be brought up entirely on a racists standpoint. The states has nothing to do with being not smart, it is the their own free will to choose not to stay in school. Get over yourself.|`|NvtetB2laa	Those classifications are there to show the government that the business isn't discriminating against non-Anglos. Check the Hispanic box. Legally they shouldn't discriminate against you and they might be short on that demographic and would give you some preference.    There's no division between Mexican and "white". One is a nationality and the other a geographic origin. Mexico classifies its population as white, Indian, or mixed, conveniently omitting the African segment of the population.|`|60JgxXVpaa	thats a new one  im from coachella ca    and the applications here are not like that    but i havent got hired either, oh and im mexican|`|PImmA8CJaa	You are not REQUIRED to give that information on any given application. It is also often that job applicants are unsure of what category that they fit into, so they try to make it as clear as possible to avoid errors.|`|aAjpk4ylaa	I don't think it is about racism.  It is about making sure that employers are NOT using racist practices and discriminating.  The info can be evaluated to see what people applied verses who was hired.  Some companies have affirmative action policies or may just want to keep up with what employees are interested in being part of their staff.
qXQa06bAaa	It's true, and as the others have said, the correct technical term is a "Dividend".  Some companies pay it out in one lump at the end of their financial year, while others will pay you an "interim dividend" (where they give you a slice of it part way through their financial year) and a "Final Dividend" (where they pay out the rest of it at the end of the year).    Others don't pay one out at all, in particular GOOGLE (ticker = GOOG) doesn't, while "Berkshire Hathaway" (a company owned by legendary stockmarket investor Warren Buffett) hasn't paid one out since 1967.... but it's mostly new companies & technology stocks that don't pay them out.    How much you get depends on the company, but it's generally nothing to get too excited about unless you've bought a HUGE number of shares in a particular stock.  Usually at the end of the financial year the company bosses will give a figure of how much dividend they're paying out per share in their company's stock that year, and a cut-off date (or "Ex. Dividend" date as it's commonly known) for buying those shares and being entitled to the pay-out...  e.g. Say you had 10 shares in the company on 5th February, and the cut-off (ex. dividend) date was on the 6th February.... if you bought 10more shares in the company on 9th February, then you'd only get the pay out for the original 10shares, not 20shares (but then you'd get paid 20shares worth of dividends next time the shares go ex. dividend).    The amount you receive is a pretty simple piece of maths...  (Dividend per Share) x (Number of shares you own)  So, for instance if they're paying out 0.10 per share, and you own 10 shares in the company (just to keep the maths simple) then you'll get 1.00 (0.10 x 10)  If it's 0.10 per share and you own 100 shares (0.10 x 100) = 10  The more shares you own, the more you get paid......... and how much varies between companies - it'll usually tell you if you look at the prices & quotes at these sites (though they don't always keep the info that well updated):  http://quote.fool.co.uk (UK Stocks / Shares)  http://quote.fool.com (US Stocks)  http://finance.yahoo.com (Worldwide)  For instance, looking through some of the companies I own shares in...  British-American Tobacco (BATS.L) = 0.94 this year  Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) = 0.05  Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG.L) = 0.27  FIRST Group (FGP.L) = 0.20  Some wise investors usually use the money earned from it to buy even more shares (if the price is right)..... and use it so their Stock portfolio becomes more & more self-funding as the number of shares they own + dividends they're entitled to keep on increasing (or others may transfer it to a savings account, or spend it).    Earning dividends is one of the ways of making money from Stocks/Shares (largely a perk / bonus of owning them)....... but the main one with most investors is carefully choosing cheap shares, then hanging onto them for as long as possible and (hopefully) watch them increase in value before selling them on for profit - sometimes by personal choice, other times because another company (or richer investor than you) has bought up the whole company.|`|C233ATPvaa	Yes its called a "dividend" "dude". Pay out is depending on company policy  Look up the site called investopedia.org    It will greatly enhance your brain.|`|RCbIDJndaa	It's called a dividend. It's usually paid annually but there's nothing stating that companies *have* to pay anything at all though. It's a nice bonus when it happens!
dD1MyFsraa	if you efiled before wednesday your refund will be there on not that friday but the following friday   and you filed after wednesday at noon cmt then you will get  it in not that friday not the next friday but the next one assuming that nothing is wrong with then return|`|X2gYaTEVaa	It goes in waves; it can be anywhere from 8 to 14 days, depending on what day you filed.   If you file and are accepted (very important!) by noon on Thursday, your return is supposed to be deposited the next Friday (so noon today, Friday the 13).  Those of us who e-filed the first few days have been experiencing some delays; mine was supposed to be deposited last Friday but instead is scheduled to be deposited tomorrow.  You can check the status on the IRS's Where's My Refund page.
M2WniUdzaa	I don't know why you owe either, but here are some suggestions....make sure that you answered the questions like can you be claimed as a dependent on some one else's return (NO,) make sure you are entering the information relating to your child correctly.  If those things are correct, you need to look at your federal withholdings.  Did you have some where in the field of $4000 withheld?  Also, don't forget the rebate recovery credit, you should get a credit of $300 for the child if you are adding him to your return for the first time.|`|AA10469473	You made about the same, but did you have the same amount withheld total?  If not, your refund would be lower, maybe enough to mean that you owe rather than getting any refund.    I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.    You mention "the more W-2's I enter..." which sounds like you have a lot of them.  Each job takes out like it's the only job you have.  When you actually file your tax return, everything is added together, showing a much higher total income than if you had just one of the jobs.    Look at how much total was withheld in 2008 and compare that to 2007.  If about the same amount was withheld, and you made about the same total amount, then your refund shouldn't have decreased, especially with adding a dependent.  But if your withholding is much less, then it sounds like you didn't have enough taken out, so now you have to pay in the rest of what you owe.|`|0JoWTQWoaa	It has to do with the exemptions you and your husband claimed on your W-4.  You did not have enough federal taxes withheld. Your income seems to high to qualify for earned income credit.  It sucks, but it is life.  It is not an error on Turbo tax's fault. If you feel that it is, try another program like taxact.com and see if you get a different result.|`|5o7ttdRcaa	We did that last year and it turned out one of us claimed the dependent and the other one didn't.  I could have kicked myself.|`|538ab5ecdacab6b5aa127afe86626733aa	The gov just stealin your money!|`|NrvrH4zQaa	The more you make, the more they take.    If you have multiple jobs use Married - 2 on one W4 (the job with the highest income).  Use Single - 0 on all additional jobs.  Low-paying part-time jobs usually end up withholding nothing, but the extra income is taxed in the end.  When my wife worked a part-time job in the past we used Single - 0 plus had an additional $25 withheld per paycheck - and that was rarely enough.

mh0QRDE9aa	Good Luck, you are at the bottom of the ladder.  With unemployment over 7% you are in competition with over 2 million people who are out of work.  At your age, you are limited to hours to be able to work and with out skills or experience.  If I were you, I would start putting in applications in everywhere  you can, including fast food places, and you might find something sometime.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Culver's minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.    I called many stores because I am 14 looking for a job. This was the response they gave which makes me happy after looking for so long.    Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.      What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.    Try local grocery stores, pizza parlors, retail stores, fast food restaurants.

Ti0q1Btiaa	Search for every avenue you can find that is an opportunity for waste or theft, customer and/or employees.    Paper, toilet paper, paper clips, small things that we all overlook in good times.  (Toilet paper is an attraction for theft, believe it.)    Delete every Discretionary expense, non essentials, publications, unless it's one that helps you in business.    Cut advertising, only if it exceeds your planned budget, with lower volume.  Some businesses actually increase advertising in these times, but do it wisely.   Advertise in media that targets your customer base, your location.    Fixed expenses cannot be deleted, but may be reduced.  Electricity, etc.  (I once knew a man who turned off the lights or most in the stock room.  He explained that those were little heaters and created AC usage)  .  Cut travel and entertainment, unless necessary.  Cut your own draw to bone.    Cut employee wages as a last resort, or, only layoffs if necessary.    Know your break even point.  This will allow you to cut markup without losing money even if you don't make a net profit.

7ikxxTS9aa	If you are looking for low or no tax states, you may want to look to Alaska.  This state receives revenues from oil pumped out of their ground by the oil companies.  They actually provide a dividend to all the residents from the excess fees collected from oil production.  You can check further with the State website.  The problem is you must be a resident.  The weather conditions keep many people from moving there.     Another state you may want to consider is Utah.  They generate of revenue from gambling operations and offset the collection of taxes from the residents.  This may be more suitable to living there.|`|IUQzWrb7aa	You might to start with states that have no Income tax, such as Florida, New  Hampshire, Texas, Washington etc etc. But they may make up for it with higher Sales and Real estate taxes for example.     Translation: There's no free lunch! Good Luck!|`|sI3krJULaa	I'm not aware of any state that doesn't get what it needs somehow.  There are 7 states with no income tax, and 2 that only tax interest and dividends.  However, in states with low or no income tax, you're often paying higher taxes in other areas, like sales tax or property tax.  Bottom line- the state has to make money somehow, and they can only sell so many bonds (which is essentially just borrowing, anyway.)    If you're planning on moving, don't go to NY or CA.  Both states are on the far side of UNfair.  I live in CA, and not only do we have the highest maximum income tax, but we also tack on a 1% mental health tax (don't ask) to incomes over a certain limit, so that if you make a decent amount of money (you don't have to be filthy rich or anything) we end up paying, effectively, about 50% of our wages in taxes.    Good luck. :0)

It will increase their return or reduce the ammount owed.|`|AA10469473	If the grant didn't cover all of your tuition and fees, then your parents would very possibly get a tax break for the tuition and fees not covered by the grant, by taking an education credit for you.

It seems odd that you would get a student loan statement while you are still in college (unless you're doing graduate studies).    1098t is given to those who are in the process of payijng back a loan. If you are and are stsill in college you can get that loan deferred for a   of years.    Another thing that's odd about this is that you're parents didn't realize that they should wait for the 1098t? If they know you're paying back a student loan they either should have waited or their accountant should have suggested they wait.    It is possible that they estimated how much was paid in interest in 2008. In that case you really shouldn't have to do anything unless they were off on their estimate.|`|DoWpe01Oaa	Miss Google gave the answer   https://www.fs.uci.edu/Tra97/faqs/1098T....    looks like this will answer all your questions.

If your parents claimed you as a dependent, they could take the deduction from the 1098-T.     I would have them call their tax preparer if they have one. If not, I would contact one- it may save them a lot of money or give them a better tax refund. They should be able to amend the return. Hope this helps.

l7fyLFFtaa	You'll need a business license and DBA (go to city hall). Other than that there are no specific licenses needed for a camp. You may want to become a non-profit organization for tax and grant purposes. Contact your local Small Business Administration (SBA) office for more information.    Insurance is something that is very important to have. One way around that is to become a contract instructor through your local parks and recreation department. They will partner with your wife if they like the ideas she has. They will advertise the camp in their brochure and take all the registration (this allows parents to pay with credit card as well). They will also provide the space. There is a split of around 60/40 or 65/35 in fees. Basically your wife says she want to make a certain amount per camper and the recreation department adds 35% to that.      Another thing is that all staff and volunteers will need to be fingerprinted. That can be done at your local police station and costs around $60 per person for a DOJ background check.    Finally I would suggest that you become ACA accredited. Even if you don't want to go through the accreditation process you should contact the American Camp Association for more information of starting and running a camp. They have offices all over the country. You can visit their website at http://www.acacamps.org/.    I've been in camping and the recreation industry for years. It's a wonderful thing.

A lot of responsibilities come from owning. Mostly paying the tax bill on time.   I understand that you have disputed the tax bill, and have not heard back yet. Do me a favor, pay the bill, and then go through the motions to file for a rebate.  Start a paper trail. Make notes of any conversations you have with people in the tax office, and follow up with something in writing.  Keep in mind appraisals can be all over the map. You could pay for 5 different people to give you appraisals, and get 5 different values for your property.  That won't help you with a rebate on your taxes.  You have to do some homework, take pictures of the property, and find "comparables" to get an idea of the property value. Can you get to your local town hall (in LA)and check out what the locals are paying for their taxes? Once you find a whole bunch of properties to compare yours with, then you submit all that with a rebate   form.  Sometimes you just might win.

They may have special software and will want to know your flexibility learning new software.  Your computer skills in general will be discussed.    How good are you at multi-tasking (sometimes you'll have a patient checking in, phones ringing, and a bill to get together all at once...how well can you handle that)...    Wear business attire...always better to dress up than down (so suit if you have it, if not a nice button down shirt and pressed slacks).  Wear minimal jewelry and minimal makeup.  Use lotion on your hands before going in so they will be smooth (but not wet!).  Don't wear a strong smell...    Be prepared to offer references and give them an idea of what salary you want.  If possible, look them up online first and be prepared.    good luck!
SEwqwjPkaa	I think the asker is more than aware this is just a proposal at this time, however, unlike most of the other members here I actually read the question...    The new proposal which already passed the senate and is now in the hands of the house states that the proposed $15k tax credit would NOT have to be paid back.  What others are not telling you is that the new provision has been revised by the house to include REMOVAL of the "payback clause" on the original $7500 credit we're all way to familiar with.  So, if the bill passes as it stands right now, those who took the $7500 credit will NOT have to pay it back and may even get an additional $7500 credit if they meet the requirements.    Again, this is of course, IF THE STIMULUS BILL PASSES as it is.  Fingers crossed as there's a CD out there with my name on it just waiting for this $.    Peace!  The Reverend|`|UV2V8oBYaa	yes it is a loan.|`|jCvBMlvKaa	The current 15k one doesnt have to be paid back.|`|snh9wzpnaa	Nobody can answer your question about a law that is not even written yet.

They have probably just seen the tip of the iceberg.  I think the government, especially President Obama, is preparing to play hardball with these guys.  Either they will do as they are told, or they will be forced to get out of the banking business.  The public will not support nor countenance their lavish lifestyles any longer.  That will force them to agree to restrict pay and bonuses, or their institutions will receive no bail out money from U.S.  In that case, their banks will fold and be nationalized, and they will be out the door anyway.

It really is quite easy, when you are working with the right people. You get the Lender( whom you are not obligated to work with if they don't earn your business) to run your credit and check your income etc. to see what amount you qualify to purchase, then you decide what size payments equal to or better yet below that amount that you want to spend.  The agent sets you up to receive emails, text messages, or faxes daily of any new listings that fit the area, size, price range, etc. that you are going to look at. You then tell your agent which homes to show you, You pick a home and start the offering process. Within 30 days the home is yours and the banks.  Good luck, contact me at www.jimbible.com|`|AnptZGTtaa	Find you a good Realtor and he or she can put you in touch with a good mortgage person.

That is called conversion.  They have to take you to court to collect any monies due.  If you were not on the lease, you generally are deemed to be a month-to-month tenant.  You said "She" gave you three days, is that the Landlord?  Did she not give you a 3-day termination notice?  If not, you could probably fight it.  You will be required to pay for the time you were there, but if it was not your fault you were evicted, and you can prove that, the 30=day notice becomes invalid.  Hope this helps.  Go to your local courthouse clerk's office and see if they have your state's information on landlord/tenant rules.

AA10305589	Unless you have a specialization (i.e. tech jobs, service jobs, admin jobs, etc.) you should be pitching to the HR departments of any and all companies you can think of - every company that hires employees is a potential client.        In order to get companies to pay you to post their positions, you should be able to prove sufficient traffic for it to be a good investment on their part.  If no one is using your site, why would they pay to post it there?  So you may want to start as a free posting site, to get your traffic up, and then implement a pricing plan to start generating income.  If you have good traffic you should be able to get other paid ads on your site, so you'll have two revenue streams (the job posters and the ads).

That's why, when you first buy insurance, you need to decide what you want the insurance to ACCOMPLISH for you, and you select the policy type based on that.    If you want to KEEP life insurance for your whole life, you PAY your whole life - even if it ends up costing you more than the policy would pay out.    It sounds like she bought 20 year term, GUARANTEED RENEWABLE.  Well, this is the 'renewable' price.  MOST people buy 20 year term, with the idea, that 1.  it's MUCH cheaper than whole life insurance   2.  they're going to bank the difference between the term and the whole life policies and 3.  after the 20 years is up, they would have SAVED the face value of the policy in their bank or investment account, and can afford to "self insure".  Not to mention, the major need of life insurance - to provide for minor children - is usually nonexistant any more.    Let me ask, what is the GOAL of the life insurance?  I doubt she has minor children.  If she's got $10,000 to her name, she can prepay her funeral now.  If she wants to leave you an inheritance, and she has money in the bank, or retirement funds, or even a house, well, $50,000 doesn't go that far, and it's probably silly to renew this policy for another 20 years.       At 77, I don't know of ANY insurance company, that will give her life insurance, for ANY PRICE.  Well, if she wants to pay $55,000 for a $50,000, I'm sure that could be arranged.  But even the guaranteed issue companies cut off new policies at the age of 76.    Unless you are the policy owner, you would NOT receive any notice.  Only the policy owner is notified.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	this sounds like it's a term insurance policy (if it was a set price for 20 years and then it went up, chances are slim it would be whole life...whole life premiums should stay the same).  This is one of the main reasons that term insurance is not the best way to go.    Notices and statements go to the policy owner only.  If you don't own the policy you don't get statements (chances are your mother is the owner and would be getting those statements).    Chances or getting a new policy at age 77 with health issues are somewhat slim, but your best bet is to contact an insurance broker and talk to them.  A broker can go over all the options available to your mother.|`|AA11064536	It all depends on the TYPE of life insurance your mother owns.  If it is term insurance, then this is exactly what happens.  If you keep this policy, then next year the premiums will go up again.  Only the issuing insurance company can tell you for certain.    If it is a whole life policy, her premiums should not increase and she should still have the same coverage.    If it is a universal life policy, then with low interest rates (and the turmoil in the financial markets), the cash value in the life insurance did not grow as the insurance company expected and thus they have to raise the premiums your mother pays.    When people buy term insurance, they do so with the strategy that they will have enough money when the term runs out (20 years or 30 years) that they will be able to pay all of their bills for the rest of their life.    Your mother may be in a position that she is not 100% financially independent at this point in her life.  She is not alone.    I suggest that you first determine the type of policy that you own.  Then contact the insurance company and ask for an "In force illustration."    You will need to have your mother with you when you call the insurance company because the ins co cannot release information to anyone without your mother's permission.    Talk to an insurance agent or financial planner about your options.  One option is a "Life Settlement" where a company buys your mother's insurance policy from her.  This will often give her more cash now than surrendering the policy.  Of course, that means that the beneficiaries will get nothing from the insurance policy when she dies but at least your mother will not have to continue the insurance payments.    Good Luck and realize that many seniors are in this same position now.    *|`|ygAj2cCYaa	If it was whole life with a term blend (something that was popular 20 years ago) and sold with a dividend assumption that did not come true, this could happen once the automatic premium loans become too much. I've seen it happen several times.     If it was universal life, the internal costs could have gone up or the interest rate could have gone down. Most policies 20 years ago did not have a "secondary guarantee".    If this was a 20 year term, it sounds like it's performing like it's supposed to.    In any respect, if it was underfunded in any way or it's just renewing at a higher rate after the level term, her loyalty to the company won't change the contract she has. With diabetes and a heart condition, she should consider either keeping the policy (because now the coverage is worth more to her) or selling it if she can't afford the premiums. I can't imagine her getting another policy besides a guarantee issued contract.    Good luck.|`|xb255X0faa	Not sure, but it sounds like she had a 20-year level premium term product.  At the end of the 20 year level period you can keep the insurance but the rates will probably increase every year.      If she has her original policy it should show the schedule of premiums.  If you don't have it anymore then call up the insurance company and tell them to send her a copy of her policy pages.      If it is a universal life insurance policy it is possible that the poor investment performance of the past couple of years has robbed the policy of its cash value and forcing her to pay a higher premium to make up the difference.      They are probably not trying to rip you off, but obviously doing a poor job of explaining things.  Call back and see if you can talk to someone who is a little more helpful or at least find out what kind of policy it is and come back here and ask some more questions.
gbqc3ENnaa	If her home mortgage rate was higher than her line of credit it makes sense.  I do not have a home mortgage but I do have a line of credit on my home.      Normally you can just make interest payments on a equity line if you want.  My heloc is locked for 5 years with minimum payment being the monthly interest.    Normally people do borrow on their home to pay off their home when they refinance.|`|BTfb1xMhaa	Technically, you can do that. Pay off your mortgage with your (Home Equity Line of Credit) HELOC. It doesn't make much sense because the bank who financed the HELOC can still foreclose on the house.    Plus you still owe money on your house, so it doesn't make sense to move money from a HELOC vs. a mortgage.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	Sure it's possible but why would she do that? Now she still owes money on the house but her interest rate is completely adjustable and probably higher than where it was with her first mortgage. The terms of an equity line or 2nd mortgage are never as good as a 1st mortgage.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

So while you would not wear a suit and tie to a gas station interview you would wear a nice polo or button down shirt and khakis or dress slacks, no jeans, shorts or t - shirts.|`|AA11173563	I would but do as you please|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The rule of thumb is to dress one level above the normal dress requirements for the job.  If the folks working there wear casual clothing such as jeans and tees then you'd want to wear slacks and a shirt or Polo with a collar.  If they wear slacks and collars then a suit and tie would be appropriate.    It is possible to overdress for an interview!  If you were applying for a job as a mechanic a suit and tie would probably be too much.  That said, err on the side of over-dressing if you're not sure of the culture.  You can always doff the coat and loosen your tie if you are obviously overdressed.    Ideally you want to make a good impression and that you are ready to "hit the ground running" immediately.

The important thing is to wear clean and non-wrinkled clothing that is suitable and to bathe and smell nice, if you don't make an effort for a job interview, chances are you won't care at all after you are hired. Look at the type of clothing other gas station clerk wear, wear something similar, if they are wearing a uniform polo-style shirt and slacks, for example, find something like that and wear it to the interview.|`|L3VbnH1faa	yes. how you dress/how you present yourself counts for about 75% of your interview.

s28LQ6hlaa	Volunteering is a great way to get references. It's perfect for a 1-2 month commitment. Be friendly, show your willingness to do whatever needs to be done, vocalize ideas, get to know someone who works with the organization that you are volunteering with.   Volunteering also shows that you are self-motivated and can work as part of a team.   Pick either a group you are excited about or a task that you enjoy doing. If you don't find opportunities that fit, approach groups and offer your volunteer services directly to them.   To get a reference out of it, I suggest agreeing to a schedule of times you will be available to them. To form the necessary relationships, I'd go at least once a week until you have the job that you want to use the reference for.   Tell people you meet volunteering that you will be looking for a job. They might be great resources for you.   Remember: be careful not to over-commit. The biggest mistake you could make would be to appear unreliable. Don't worry, they will appreciate any help you can give them and you can always do more if you find that you have time.|`|AA11052217	Do some volunteer work and ask for references from whatever agency you volunteer for.  You could also get a temporary job and ask to list your temp. employer as a reference.  Personal references won't help much when applying for a job.

Gift tax is assessed for the giver, not the recipient.

If the gifts are cash or very large then they could become income to the receiver but still not deductible to the giver.

kOcBfbRraa	Sort of.....  you fill out your normal tax return, but in your case you will now also be reporting "self-employed" or Business Income.  The schedule you fill all your income and expenses on is called a T2125. Your "net income" from the business activity is then transferred to page 2 of your T1 return.    This is the first year for the T2125 form. The old form for you was a T2124, and Professional Income (accountants, doctors etc) used to be on a T2032. Both types are now on the new T2125.  Simply go to your tax office and pick up a Business Income booklet or download the form online.|`|5dXsErAaaa	You fill out the T1 with the T2125  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t2125/...|`|C5KNUDecaa	self employment is usually reported on a form called 1099 misc which is like a W2. the difference is W2 are wages which have all the amounts taken out for taxes. 1099 form has gross numbers. which means you will need to pay the taxes that were not taken out at the beginning. But the good part is, what ever your expenses you had, can be deducted against the gross amount. Again, you can check with http://www.irs.gov for more answers to being a self employed. Most of these are done on 1040 forms.  If your income is high with a lot of expense, you may want to consider changing from a sole proprietor to a corporation.

AA11519518	Benapec is fake. For a start, Benin is a French-speaking country but BENAPEC is an English acronym, which indicates the scammers who run this fraud are English-speaking Nigerians.    The recently created domain benapec.com (March 2007) is hosted on a server in Nigeria.    A search for the name "Benapec" has no oil industry related hits, only sites where people ask if it's a scam. This would not be the case for a legitimate major oil company.    The domain is used in employment scams, where job seekers are tricked into sending cash by Western Union to fake immigration officials / lawyers / travel agents. It's a West African advance fee scam (419 scam).    Beware of any job offers where you have to send money to immigration officials or travel agents in the country where the job is offered. If you need a work visa you always have to go through the embassy in your country.|`|cLHdhPeTaa	They produce hate,fear,oppression and want.|`|9ItI2TVTaa	Hey i got also a similar offer.Have you got any confermation as to if this company is genuine or its kind of scam.Please   let me know immidiately.Cheers
AA11519518	Yes, there are money laundering scams with both checks and direct deposit bank transfers. Phishing scams usually involve money laundering via direct deposit and tend to be run by Eastern European gangs, while check scams usually are run by Nigerian gangs (though there a few exceptions to this rule).    Because direct deposit by bank wire transfer is a) traceable and b) international transfers can't usually be done via online banking (without prior paperwork), phishing gangs can not easily move money directly from hacked online accounts to untraceable offshore accounts. What they do is to recruit "money mules", i.e. job seekers who believe they're being recruited by a legitimate company.     The criminals then wire cash from the hacked account to the account of the "employee" . The helper withdraws the cash and typically wires 93% of it abroad by Western Union while keeping 7%. The percentages vary, as does the storyline and the country the money is sent to.    A few days or weeks later the original account owner finds that cash is missing and alerts the bank, which traces the transfer to the account of the "employee". It reverses the unauthorized transfer. The owner of the hacked account has his money back, but the "employee" is now deeply in the red, owing thousands of dollars / euros / pounds to the bank because he withdrew money that didn't belong to him.    NEVER use your bank account for cashing checks or forwarding wire transfers from third parties.     There are NO LEGITIMATE JOBS like that, they're all scams. It's illegal, even if the checks weren't fake or stolen and the wire transfer from phished accounts as they usually are, as it violates anti-money laundering and other financial regulations, besides, there are cheaper and safer alternatives available to legitimate businesses. Why should I pay 7-10% of $5000 (i.e. $350-500) to wire cash from the USA to Europe if any major US bank will do it for about $40?    DO NOT withdraw any funds that arrive in your account if you have already taken the job. Report it to the bank and the police.|`|NgRaaeTUaa	It can still be a scam if the transfer done by the scammer by using someone elses bank account.    Say the scammer has got access to someone elses bank account and he transfers money to yours then you take your 'processing fee' and transfer the rest of the money to the scammer's account. The scammer cashes the money and disappears. Next you get a call/letter saying the money sent to you was done in error and you have to return the money. Since you didn't sell a product or service you have no proof what the money was for and so its all on you!!!

Jdf1b0nTaa	Hi    A bank cannot refuse to open you up a bank account, if they try to say this to you tell them they cant. They will back down!! However, they will only issue the most basic account which means there will be no overdraft or cheque book, just a cash card. It all depends what you mean by poor credit rating. If you have been made bankrupt then the above sort of account will be the sort you will be offered. If you are just naturally in debt but are working then most banks will give you an account and a debit card. If you do get accepted dont have an overdraft, this will help you in the long run.    My suggestion is to ask at some high street banks for an account and see what they say.

Weather you make a profit or not will depend on how much you paid for the property and what you are able to sell the property for.    If you buy a property in a neighborhood for $200,000 and the houses are going for that same price then you will not make a profit. If you can purchase the same property for $150,000 there is a possibility that you could earn a profit.    There is always closing cost in the purchase and selling of real estate, nothing secret or hidden.    If you plan to do this you should go to a book store and purchase a few books on buying and selling real estate for a profit, profiting in the real estate market, buying and rehabbing and selling distressed properties.

Un Modelo de Produccin Individual: es aquel que se sigue por producto, esto es que cada producto tiene una elaboracin nica y partcular, como los artesanos, por ejemplo el vidrio soplado, que aunque la tcnica para la elaboracin de jarras o vasos de vidrio soplado es la misma, cada producto es distinto por que se le decora de manera artstica y artesanal.  Un Modelo de Produccin por Lotes: es cuando una vez que defines el dise?o de tu producto elaboras una cantidad redituable de productos del mismo modelo, digamos 100 y el siguiente producto defines el modelo distinto y haces otros 100, por ejemplo, las imprentas, un cliente manda a hacer un ciento de tarjetas de presentacin, y otro manda a hacer 200 invitaciones para una boda etc., cada producto se elabor por lote.  Lnea de produccin es cuando hablando de un modelo de produccin en masa, ste lleva en su elaboracin una serie de pasos o un proceso en el que pasa por distintas etapas en su elaboracin, el total de pasos o el proceso completo es la lnea de produccin, por ejemplo, una embotelladora, 1.- Las botellas pasan por el esterilizador,   2.- salen en por la banda que los mueve al rea de llenado.  3.- Entran de una en una y se van llenando   4.- Pasan por el rea de sellado y se les pone el tapn  5.- Pasan por la pantalla de rayos para verificar la pureza del lquido.  6.-Pasan a la lnea de empaque.    Como ves el producto final llev una serie de pasos, todos los pasos en conjunto son la lnea de produccin.    Flujo de Produccin, es la cantidad de productos que se elaboran dentro de la lnea de produccin y que no se detienen, mismo caso de la embotelladora, suponte que es una planta peque?a en la que se empacan jugos de uno en uno, o quiz una mega planta en donde se empacan de 100 en 100, el movimiento constante del producto dentro de la lnea de produccin es el flujo de la produccin.

Also, there are many websites asking you to sign up as an 18 years or older member. For this i can suggest asking your parents (or any siblings you have over that age) if you can give their imformation and sign them up on free websites.  The problem with that is the phone numbers you provide, many companies will call, so expect an increase in daily telemartketing calls, and they do send mail to your address you give, such as credit card offers. So if you plan on giving you parents (or sibling's) info, make sure you let them know whats in store for them, but tell them you will handle it, so that they do not get irritated.

97d87f33ece2d1c2b9f13ad8a6b488e7aa	Qual a dura??o do investimento: curto (especula??o), mdio ou longo (investimento) prazo?    Barbosa.  __________    Bom, para investimentos no curto prazo (especula??o),  sempre bom ler vrios cenrios (pelo menos trs), prospectos de empresas, agendas do ms, boletins das corretoras, etc., e s depois de analisar tudo isso, optar por um ou dois setores e investir em a??es de empresas que atuem nestes setores. Por exemplo: A atual temporada de furac?es no hemisfrio norte, a baixa nos estoques de petrleo dos EUA, os conflitos no Iraque assim como os agravamentos nas rela??es entre EUA e Ir?, os sucessivos recordes do pre?o do petrleo em Londres e Nova York, um possvel inverno rigoroso na Europa, o aumento na demanda por energia no mundo (principalmente China, ndia, EUA e emergentes), as boas perspectivas internas no campo da poltica e economia, alm da amplia??o da oferta da comdite no Brasil, me faz crer um cenrio altamente promissor para o setor petrolfero nacional, ou seja,  POSSVEL, que a??es de empresas do setor se valorizem mais que a mdia das demais a??es nos prximos meses. A empresa mais representativa dessa industria  a Petrobrs, portanto  possvel esperar uma boa valoriza??o nos papeis da referida empresa.    Essa anlise eu fiz a trs meses atrs e resolvi investir tudo em a??es prefernciais da Petrobrs (PETR4). Me dei muitssimo bem, alm do mais as a??es at julho estavam praticamente estagnadas, e julguei que sendo uma das maiores empresas do pas, era muito pouco provvel que haveriam quedas acentuadas no perodo. Tracei uma estratgia, estipulei um teto e assim que este teto foi alcan?ado me livrei das a??es, obtendo lucro.     Na atual conjectura, ainda acredito que tais a??es poder?o se valorizar bem at o final do ano, mas de forma muito mais irregular, o que poder gerar quedas acentuadas no perodo, portanto  sempre bom sangue frio para se especular no curto prazo, alm de saber o momento certo para entrar e sair,  necessrio n?o se deixar levar pela emo??o, manter o foco e analisar bem a situa??o antes de aderir ao "esprito de manada" muito comum em crises sistmicas, como verificado no estouro da bolha imobiliria americana.     Dia 22 ltimo apostei minhas fichas na BRAP4 (preferenciais da Bradesco Participa??es), e at agora foram 6,33% de ganho bruto, mas a inten??o  chegar aos 23,50%. A escolha, obviamente n?o foi por acaso. Julgo que o final de ano seja um perodo bastante promissor para o setor bancrio. "Coincidentemente" ontem, o Bradesco anunciou lucro recorde.    Portanto, minhas apostas para o curto prazo s?o a??es do setor petroqumico e bancrio, mais necessariamente as a??es da Petrobrs, Ita, Bradesco, dentre outras empresas que estejam inseridas nestes setores e apresentem a??es com menor liquidez. Essa posi??o vale apenas por 48 horas, ou seja, depois deste prazo teria que agregar mais informa??es, e aplicar em tais empresas, poderia n?o mais ser interessante diante de outras possibilidades mais lucrativas.    Essa  apenas minha opini?o,  aconselhavel e responsvel colher mais pelo menos trs outros pontos de vistas de pessoas que atuem na rea, ou sua corretora de preferncia.    Em rela??o aos riscos, eles existem e s?o muitos. Desde a falncia da empresa e/ou uma queda na liquidez de seus papeis (como verificado pela Varig em 2006), at mesmo o estouro de uma bolha financeira no exterior (como ocorrido a dois mese e meio atrs, no EUA). Tudo, absolutamente tudo, pode afetar direta ou indiretamente este mercado, at mesmo as areias do deserto do Saara (e n?o estou brincando, estou falando srio mesmo), ano passado, quando todos esperavam uma temporada avassaladora de furac?es nos EUA, foram justamente as areias do Saara que impediram a forma??o de tais furac?es e mantiveram os estoques americanos normalizados, diminuindo as press?es de demanda quanto a referida comdite. No entanto, fatos que aparentemente tem enorme relevancia no longo prazo, pode n?o ter a menor importancia no curto prazo. Saiba distinguir o que  importante e o que n?o . E tenha sempre em mente que o mercado de a??es  um investimento de alto risco.    Portanto, para os principiantes, nada de devaneios, opte sempre por empresas de ponta com a??es que apresentem tima liquidez, estude muito, esteja sempre conectado. Saiba exatamente onde est entrando (prazos, taxas, mtodos, etc.). Com o valor supra citado est no limite das oportunidades de ganhos no curto prazo, o que dever requerer ainda mais cuidados.

Previously you didn't notice that although you got interest on your savings, the company that generated that interest for you also made enough from your savings to stay in business, pay staff, run offices.  Those costs were taken out before you got what was left (your 'interest').    Now things get more interesting.  Explore other forms of investment- premium bonds, savings certificates, possibly even a small dabble in the stock market.  It may take a while to decide, but you have time now -that you didn't have while working.  Make your time work for you!|`|xFm5wzuXaa	At least it is not going to 335 million in "arts" and 15o million for abortions.    If I was you I would be grateful, I am embarrassed of my President and his supporters.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Interest is only given on savings to keep in line with inflation so you can't rely on interest for an income. If inflation's down then it means prices of things generally won't be going up (obviously it's complicated by fuel prices atm) so it should mean your savings are still the same amount in actual value. I can understand what you mean, I'm in a similar situation and cutting the rates seems to only be benefiting people who are debt rather than people who have saved sensibly but if you didn't put money into a private pension scheme then you should have been expecting to cut into your savings to supplement your income, not just rely on the fact that interest was always going to be high enough to live off.|`|zG1m1eXxaa	The banks are vital for the success of an economy, they are the ones who turn saving into investment.  When you put your money into a bank, the bank then lend that money out in the form of a loan to other businesses and in mortgages to allow them to expand and generate more income, they then take repayments on the loan with interest and this works as long as everyone doesn't take all their money out at once, or else they'll have no money to lend out or repay the accountsthey've taken money out of.  If Brown didn't save the banks your savings in the bank are gone as the bank doesn't have to repay your money if it goes bust.   By using taxpayers money he is giving people confidence in the banks so everyone doen't withdraw their money at once, which will cause the bank to collaspe (like Northern Rock did).  As for the people who voted for him, any one who voted labour in the last election helped him into power. Remember the U.K had a good economy then and (nearly) everyone was happy.  Just remeber the UK is not alone in this recession, Iceland had to ask Russia for money, Ireland is borrowing 50 million a day to keep the country running (a huge amount for a country with only 4 million people), Toyta announced it's first ever lost, banks over a hundred years old have gone bust.  and on a final note it was ordinary men and women who took out these massive debts in the first place to pay these loans, they should have used better judgement than living on credit cards and taking out loans when they had little money to repay them.

Businesses need to trust that their telecommuting employees will get the work done without missing target dates or sacrificing quality. Telecommuting employees need to trust that their physical absence from the office won't have a negative impact on their standing in the company and they won't grow to become isolated from the company's culture. Both sides should set some ground rules before embarking on telecommuting arrangements.    Telecommuting arrangements can work quite well if work objectives are clearly defined and results are measurable. "Management by walking around" is not a style that works for telecommuting, so managers need to be receptive to more of a "management by objective" model. Managers need to clearly define goals and expectations and then be able to communicate them clearly to the employee. The telecommuting employee's performance then needs to be measured on the achievement of these objectives.    Communication may be the single most important factor in any work-at-home arrangement. Since it's not possible to drop in on a telecommuting employee or have important news conveyed around the water cooler, channels of communication between telecommuters and their managers need to be open. Again, the manager's style and the employee's style of communication need to be in alignment.    For example, if a manager wants to make the telephone the primary means of communication for telecommuting employees, some consistency can be developed so that the employees are not constantly interrupted by the telephone. The flexibility of working at home allows telecommuters to be more productive, but they need to be given the opportunity to prove it.    The cost of teleconferencing equipment has dropped to the point where teleconferencing by phone or video teleconferencing can be effective means of communication between telecommuters and their offices. During phone conferences, managers need to be aware of participants they're not hearing from and draw then into the discussion by asking them an occasional direct question.    E-mail can be an excellent means of communication and its main advantage is that everything is in writing. For the telecommuter who is constantly interrupted by e-mail, this can also be a major distraction. Employers should not expect telecommuters to respond immediately to every e-mail message. Instant messaging can be used for that purpose or for having interactive conversations in nearly real time. What e-mail and instant messaging lack are the physical expressions people use when they speak face-to-face as well as tone of voice. That can be a benefit when someone's physical gestures may imply anger or may result in an unintended reaction, but it can also be a drawback when a comment that would have not been taken as negative because of the context in which it was made suddenly seems like a slam in writing.    Employers can also consider establishing secure network connections that allow telecommuters to directly access the company's network at home when telecommuting just as they would do if they were in the office. Additionally, telecommuting employees can save files to the network where they can be viewed  perhaps collaborated on by others - and backed up regularly along with the rest of the company's digital assests.

When you file, you're only required to include information from your 1098 (received from your mortgage holder).  Interest paid as well as points should be listed.  In my particular case, I received 2 1098s because First Citizens sold my mortgage to Wells Fargo.  That said, the points were NOT on my 1098 from Wells Fargo but WERE on my 1098 from First Citizens.  So long as you bought the home in 2k8, you should recieve a 1098 with a points number for you to plug in.    This year I also took the $7500 home-buyer credit.  Some will tell you that a closing statement or FHA settlement form is needed when you take the credit...this is ALSO NOT TRUE!  I received my refund and was never asked for any supporting documentation from the IRS!    Good Luck and take care!  Peace!  The Reverend

I first started doing surveys about 5 years ago. I signed up with over 300 sites (today I am with well over 600 sites) and now, I regularly get paid by about 50 of them.    My first month I made a whopping $5. The next few months were more of the same. But I stuck with it and was patient. Today, again 5 years later, I regularly make at least $600 on paid surveys.    Here are the key things to remember.    1. There are no guarantees with surveys. It's all about your demographics. Sometimes they will want teens, other times they will want working moms, other time they will want physicians.    2. You really need to be with the biggest group of legit sites you can find. The more sites you are with, the more likely that you will actually match up your demographics with surveys and get paid.    3. Don't ever pay for a list. Period. All of the same information is out there for free.    4. Be patient. If it works for you, it won't work instantly. I can't tell you how many people have contacted me saying "I am giving up after a month." Well, like I said, if I did that I would have stopped making $5.    But the upside to surveys is that there is no risk. You don't spend any money and if you try it and like it, great. And if you don't you walk away. If you want to check out my blog where I track the survey sites that have actually paid me, feel free to visit http://www.thesurveystar.blogspot.com    Good luck!
OCVFrgeXaa	I would think very carefully about doing this.  I'm assuming that the debts that you have outstanding are unsecured e.g. personal loan, HP, credit cards etc?  If you remortgage to repay these debts you are converting them from unsecured to secured, which means if you don't repay the debts now, the worst that can happen is you can (eventually) be made bankrupt, but you can keep the house.  If you default on your mortgage, your lender can repossess the property.    Secondly, if you are using a debt consultancy agency, the likelihood is that you have some sort of plan (IVA?) worked out with them and your creditors to repay your debts over a fixed period of time?  Your creditors may or may not be charging you interest during this time.  If you remortgage, typically over 25 years which seems to be the norm, you will be paying interest on these debts for the entire mortgage term.    I'd suggest speaking to Citizens Advice, Nationdebtline or Consumer Credit Counselling Service - they're all free and genuinely, really helpful.    If you're adamant that you want to remortgage (and there's nothing wrong with that, provided you know the risks) then speak to an Independent Mortgage Broker or Whole of Market Advisor.  You can find a an advisor at www.unbiased.co.uk, or even better, use an advisor recommended by a friend or family member.  I would advise against using a high street bank - they tend only to lend on low risk, mainstream cases and are restricted on the products that they can recommend.  A decent broker will research the whole market, with your best interests at heart, and will work on a fee, commission or combination basis.    Good luck with whatever you do!|`|qBCGH52haa	Start shopping around for a bank to refinance your mortgage.  Basically, you will end up filling out a new application, the bank will process the new application just like your first, they will do an appraisal (well, actually you will pay for an appraisal) to check on your equity and if you qualify and have equity, you should be good to go.    However, if the value of your property has declined to below what you owe or your credit score is too low, you may not be able to re-fi.

AA10144492	You've got a couple of big questions here so I'll deal with them one at a time.    CLOTHING LINE    The fashion industry, as you can well imagine, is a very competitive one. To succeed takes knowledge, patience, talent and a bit of luck.  As far as the knowledge bit goes, I found some sources that will assist you further.    Associations may be a good avenue to explore. These organizations will address many of the thoughts, questions and concerns you'll inevitably have about the clothing industry as well as many you haven't anticipated yet.     http://www.iacde.com/ -- International Association of Clothing Designers & Executives  http://www.apparelsearch.com/association... -- Associations Directory for the Apparel & Fashion Industry    There's nothing quite like research  the more you know about the clothing industry, the better. There are plenty of free informational resources out there. Check out these articles:    http://ezinearticles.com/?Key-to-Startin...  Key to Starting Your Own Clothing Company by Bradley Johnson  http://ezinearticles.com/?Your-New-Cloth...  Your New Clothing Company  Apparel Sourcing by Bradley Johnson  http://ezinearticles.com/?Fashion-Market...  Fashion Marketing 101 by Amie Pronowski    Also, here are some book titles that may interest you:    * The Official Step-by-Step Guide to Starting a Clothing Line by Jay Arrington,  * The Business of Fashion: Designing, Manufacturing, and Marketing by Leslie Davis Burns  * Fashion for Profit (Revised Edition with Retail Chapter) by Frances Harder  * The Fashion Designer Survival Guide: An Insider's Look at Starting and Running Your Own Fashion Business by Mary Gehlhar    TRADEMARKS    To protect a business name within your industry, you would apply for a trademark.    Trademarks can be names of products or services, logos, slogans, packaging and even sounds and smells. In essence, a trademark can be almost anything that is used to identify a particular product or service. Registering a trademark grants the owner exclusive rights to the mark within the specified industry.     Of course, it's necessary to research the mark comprehensively prior to filing to ensure that there is no possibility of infringing upon another party.     This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark.     To register a trademark, that's done either through your Secretary of State for a State trademark or the US Patent & Trademark Office for a Federal trademark.     If you are only conducting business in one state, then a State trademark is most appropriate. If you conduct (OR are planning to conduct) business in at least 2 states OR between the US & any other country, you can file for a Federal trademark.    Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!

FB5IjcHeaa	It depends on if the state is a community property state. If the only money the wife has is an income from social security then no because that is judgement proff. So probably not. Call an attorney in the state and ask.|`|dPULl5hjaa	probably - talk to an attorney|`|qtHFJFvQaa	the wife is not neither is anyone else, however,  the deceased's estate is responsible.    If the Deceased had 100k but owed out 50k the rightful heirs would only get 50k.
wtQY6VEwaa	You don't need to be a citizen, but you should have some kind of resident or non-resident alien permission to license a business.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	You have to be eligible to pay taxes in order to start a business here. That means you need either a TIN (the same thing that allows you to work or file taxes w/o being a citizen) or a SSN.    You'll need to file taxes, open bank accounts, possibly get credit cards, get a license, maybe rent space...all of which require you to be documented and eligible here.    Sam
wtQY6VEwaa	How are you planning on earning interest by keeping money outside a bank? How do you plan on actually getting the money if you don't have a bank? What are your reasons for not wanting a bank?    Most don't have any fees if you keep your balance above a minimal amount, which is usually like $15 or $20. Why not just do it and get it over with? Its FDIC insured in most banks for up to $100,000.|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	How do you propose to collect this money. Whether you use Paypal or a merchant service it has to be deposited initially to a bank account or card account.    You don't need to be a bank. You can for example, collect deposits or payments for things like holidays or other services, or for payment for goods you supply. If you have credit accounts with suppliers, your customer will pay you for the goods when thay are despatched, you may not have to pay your supplier for 30 days or more.    There are a lot of honest ways to be holding money. There is nothing illegal whatsoever in banking the money you are holding and earning interest on it for yourself. These are the internal workings of your business and are nothing to do with anyone else.    The people whose money you are holding have no rights to any interest you earn, just as they would not be expected to pay the interest on any money you may borrow to fund services to them.
93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	NONE of these.  Lease PAYMENTS are the only one that is not a balance sheet account.  However, the lease OBLIGATION does appear on the balance sheet.

An ordinary job, even with minimum wage, would earn you more than this.  And a better paying job, much more.

So, who has the other $2314?|`|cB3AsABcaa	It only works if every person who signs up get another 9 people to sign up.  The amount of people willing to sign up will run out before you get the riches promised!    Call me crazy, but I prefer to work for my money.  Not a lot, but enough to know that the amount I make is related to the effort I put in (or better).    I suggest checking out the website below for a more sustainable opportunity.

0yqQg9CXaa	Put it in a cd for the next year.  The market will be too risky for now.  If you get a substancial amount google  discount brokers  like TD Ameritrade, Scott trade, Schwab, Fidelity, E-trade  You can buy cd's through them  and they don't carry the heavy fees bank cd's carry if you want to cash out.  /|`|pJ87narOaa	well i guess your best bet is open a franchise.|`|jaQnxUZ6aa	They are proportional these two things, risk and return. The more return you want, the more risk you have to take. Talking of today's situation, you should be doing well with a full bond portfolio, or with mutual funds that invest 100% in bonds. CDs are good, but you will get a better return with a bonds fund. If you are in your 20's a blend fund with 80% bonds and 20% stocks should work even better for you. I recommend you try Ameri Financial's "Analyzer" to figure your risk tolerance level, and how your best portfolio should look like, here is the link    http://www.ameri-financial.com/finance-t...    Now if you come with over a million dollars to invest, some hedge funds actually optimize return to risk ratio, and are able to provide better returns on the same amount of risk as you would take with other instruments. You can search hedgeco.com, but i can tell you to look for Global Momentum Fund, which is absolutely fantastic with its returns on a minimum risk. But you've got to have a million dollars, and you can subscribe with just $100,000. Good luck!    Y.|`|nLu8OC1Xaa	If you are risk-averse right now, I suggest you leave your money with a bank that you can rely on.  The problem nowadays is that even banks have become suspect in terms of reliability.  These supposed pillars of finance have started crumbling because of their own folly and greed.  I suggest you keep in each bank only that amount which is covered fully by deposit insurance.  In that way, whatever happens, you stand to get your money back from the insurer or the government itself.  If you have a higher risk-tolerance level, you can start looking at stocks of good companies that are sure to weather out these trying times.  You will always find some and that can provide you great returns a few years down the road.  HOWEVER, you do need to do your research well.  Or if you have someone who can do it for you, you can make a deposit in other countries which offer better interest rates.  The only thing you need to consider is the exchange rate which can go either way depending on the country of your choice.    For more on personal financial management matters, you can peruse www.talkingofmoney.com.|`|V2Om2aa3aa	No risk no gain. There is no easy money on this earth. If you don't like risky investments, my advice is to put in in bank fixed deposits or government bonds.

93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	FALSE.  The Federal Reserve is NOT who the money was owed to.  I can't 'write off' money someone owes YOU.  That would be EXACTLY what you are suggesting.|`|BlVudiyfaa	"owners" ?     I can't even fathom an answer to this post.|`|nLu8OC1Xaa	False.  The Federal Reserve cannot just write off the debts of these stupid banks because they did owe that much money to others.  These banks incurred debts by way of their transactions in mortgage-backed securities or MBS which they very easily packaged during the good times in order to make the money mill churn some more profits.  They offered loans to people who could not even present real proof of financial capability and then turned around and prepared debt securities which they offered to other institutions, investors and even sovereign funds so they could get more money to lend out and make more money from.  It was plainly crazy but they did it out of greed!  Some even executed these securities with recourse - meaning they can be held to answer for it in case the loans turn sour - which really did.  Writing off these debts could mean perpetuating and condoning those acts of  irresponsibility by these supposedly bright MBA bankers.  And what about the equally greedy investors who fell for the bait of high interest rates and returns? Everyone got hooked to the GREED CARAVAN and now you see the effect.  The world and not just the U.S. of A. is suffering.
