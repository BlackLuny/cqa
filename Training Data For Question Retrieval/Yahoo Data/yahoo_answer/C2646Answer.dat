TNTFomKeaa	Like the other posters said, these are just for schooling - to get your horse to elevate his stride.  There are plenty of good ways to make jumps without spending lots of money on wings though. If you already have poles, it should be easy. Old tires can be used as wings or fillers, wooden pallets make good fillers and can be built into brush fences if you gather up sticks. Or you can use buckets to put poles on and under fences as fillers and to make it more interesting. Bales of hay or straw also make good jumps - in themselves or as wings. Barrels also work well. Use whatever you can get your hands on.   If you are talented with a hammer and nails, you can make just about anything out of old bits of wood as long as they don't have nails or other nasties sticking out of them - be sure to check carefully!  Just make sure that a) your materials don't have any sharp edges for your horse to cut himself on and b) unless you are making cross country jumps, you should have a pole over the top of your buckets/straw/whatever so that it will fall if your horse knocks it. Safety is paramount.  When I was teaching my mare to jump, I began with simple cross rails and then I got really creative. I didn't have rail razers like in your picture - I just put a brick under the end of the pole, far cheaper and just as effective. I started making jumps out of just about everything to save money and then realized it's an excellent training technique. My horse got used to having the most random things thrown at her in the schooling arena and as a result is completely unflappable. She even jumped the upright fence with my coat thrown across it as a filler on a windy day! Besides which, it's a lot more fun making your own than spending money on expensive jumps.  Good luck. I hope this was useful for you.|`|RoPLmd2daa	I think they're only supposed to be used for flat work, like high trot poles to get them to lift their feet (I've never had a horse jump something only one foot high- they just step over it, which is the point of these "rail razers"). I would get something more sturdy for actual jumping. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't get these "rail razers"- I would get cavalettis. You can make your own ones much more cheaply, and build them to custom heights.|`|JFuVm9k5aa	what they are SUPPOSED to be for/made for is cavaletti work. to rise one end (or two) of the pole of the ground to encourage elasticity and suspension of the horse. and to used its back and hind end etc....calaletti!    im sure you could stack a few to make a "make shift" tiny jump but they are made for calaletti training.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	I've seen them advertised on other sites and they say not to stack them higher than two [[ like it shows in the link you gave ]]. So no, they can't be a 1'-2' jump.     Hope this helps :)
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What species of Pleco? Some, like the Bristlenose, breed well in captivity as long as they've got good water conditions anda nice cave, other species won't breed in captivity at all.    So what kind do you have? Check this website:  http://www.planetcatfish.com|`|tShDXmgbaa	The easiest ones to breed are the bristlenose plecos and these guys breed profolic.  The standard plecos sold at most petstores wont  breed in the aquarium.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	It depends on which of the over 200 species of plecostomous you have.  Many are easy to breed and many are diffilcult.  The zebro pleco's need a high percentage of wood in their diet to live and breed.  Making natural caves with bamboo is the best way to breed them though they have very few offspring.  You could also drill relatively level caves into a piece of driftwood and this should work as well.  Dwarf bristlenose plecos are easy to breed as well though I don't know the specifics.  A wide variety of plecostomous dig caves into the muddy river banks and spawn in there.  You could probably immitate this with pvc pipe or bamboo tied together and placed along the back of the aquarium.  Good luck.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	It depends on the species of pleco.|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	Well if youre talking about bushynose what I did was get the water soft and acidic made sure there were lots of hiding spots and fed them zuccini(you can also try other fruits / vegetables) for a week or so. Then they laid eggs :D.
eWObKmBSaa	I got two cats from the petco adoption agency, around the same price as you got yours.  YEs, they guarantee the cat is a good cat, up on shots and other stuff.  Cats are so much quieter than dogs, cats are so very clean animals.  One thing, somebody has to clean the potty box.  Well since they are my cats, I clean the box.  I sure wish that I had of had cats while my girls were young. We can learn lots from cats.  First responsibility, keep the cat box clean, keep cat fed and indoors.  Also, if you want a quieter house, you need to be quiet inside too, cause the cats do not like sudden moves, noise, it scares them.  So, we can teaah ourselves lots of things by having an animal, but let me tell you cats are so very, very clean.  Also the cat from adopt. places are already potty trained.  They are clean, quiet and wow.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Prove to her that you can look after it and afford it.|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	It followed me home can I keep it?|`|8WEShDtuaa	Cats are great if you have a mouse or bug infestation the mice and bugs will disappear like that. Cats are playful and they don't get in the way of things. They are always there when your upset with something. I have a cat i should know i had a mouse problem and the mice are gone.

I recomend a labrador or great dane. A hint of warning, Puppies are ALOT of work. Belive me I have two of them.|`|6TXiBrXOaa	It all depends on how you raise it..I have had all kinds of breeds of dogs and all have been in the house, and all did well with children and other pets. So it just depends on what you want..the amount of time you have with it, how big your yard and house is.   Good luck|`|moIPv7pFaa	The shelter would be a good place to  look first. That way, you could take your greyhound in with you to see if he gets along with the puppy you're interested in. Many times the shelter will have pure bred pups. Mixed breeds are fun too; I have a husky/Shepherd mix and she is wonderful. Puppies are a lot of work though. you may want to get one whose adult size will be smaller than your greyhound. The problem I'm having with my pup is that she plays rough, but my 10 yo Bichon DOES NOT. Loki (pup) made him bleed the other day. She's much bigger than he is and she doesn't know how strong she is.

f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	Since you are only four miles away you should be able to drain one third, to a half of the water out of the tank.  Take out the pump and decorations out of the tank.  Getting a few strong able body and a pickup truck to move the tank with the fish.    Should weigh under 150 pounds.    You may want to save the drain water to make it easier and safer to put water back into the tank.    Be extra careful when placing the tank on the truck bed and around corners, also don't hold onto any plastic molding that may be on the tank.  If you can find a plastic or rubber container that is bigger then the width and length but shorter then the height you might want to think about placing the tank into that container.  Try not to move the fish if the outside temperature is 20 degrees Farenheit difference then the tank temp.    You should have well over an hour before plugging in circulator,filter without running a risk.  Varies to quantity and size of the fish, to the time without the circulator.|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	ok this is what I did when I moved:  1. buy 3 7 gal camping water containers at the store  2. also buy enoguh small plastic ziploc containers to hold all your fish   3. Net out all your fish and put them in the ziploc containers (make sure the containers have water :))   4. siphon all the water out of the tank into the 7gal containers  5.then you can pack all the stuff up and move  6. pour all the water back into the tank, put all the fish in, and youre tank is moved! :D.  You also may need to keep the fish warm in the car. and if you are moving across the ocean to other countries you amy be screwed :(        P.S. buying all the coolers and ziploc bags cost be about $20.00 :)|`|AXTUWKwcaa	First get a big enough tubberware container to hold all of your fish. Then drain all the water out the tank obviously, and take them with you. since its only 4 miles your fish should be ok. Just try to get them out as soon as possible.    Good Luck! =]
F3LBgfvwaa	Try another type of litter box and another kind of litter. Get an enclosed or open box - whichever you don't have already. If you have scented litter get unscented, or try one made from another material. Some cats have preferences regarding their boxes and litters and will refuse to use it if they don't like it. Not sure if it will solve the problem but it's worth a try right?

Un hrisson  un domaine VARIABLE selon la saison et l'habitat. Il lui faut normalement entre 15 et 100 ha!  Et il hibernera o?    Bref un hrisson c'est pas un chien.

AA10029366	They send their minions out looking for gullible breeders. We (along with many reputable breeders I know) were contacted by one such person looking for dogs for "Snow Buddies". They wanted puppies at 5 weeks old, so they could get them trained by the "cute" stage.    No responsible breeder is willing to sacrifice the health and happiness of their puppies for a few bucks and some idiotic bragging rights for a movie that plays up "cute" while downplaying responsibility...which is why the puppies you see in the movies are invariably supplied by unethical twits.    Disney is the bane of a responsible breeder's existence.    Stories about the puppies who died on the set:  http://dogblog.dogster.com/2008/02/18/sn...  http://landofpuregold.wordpress.com/2007...|`|3zv2bbolaa	They may use as many as twenty puppies to prevent any one pup from becoming overly tired. They are carefully supervised on set to make certain all the animals involved are cared for and treated right.    They find their actors through pet agents and trainers who locate and train dogs from breeders or on occasion, rescued from shelters (Benji)    We have an agent for dogs here in Texas and my friend's Aussies have appeared in advertising, print and television as well as on some off Broadway productions.|`|IR81Dp2Zaa	im not quite one hundred percent on this but im almost positive they do not breed there own dogs im sure they go to breeders though to get them.  disney pays big bucks for the dogs to look alike so im sure is a high end breeder too.|`|cLi13FFLaa	They do not breed their own - they advertise for animals when needed for a shoot.   The series "Lassie" had 4 different dogs and the recent movie "Marly and Me" used 22 dogs.  They need only look similar.  They make them up to all look the same.

All of my dogs would 'ignore' everything that was accidentally dropped to the floor.  They were all trained from the youngest age to do this, and to accept only 'treats' that were given to them in a 'certain way' ... that made the dogs 'safe' in case of poisoning.  I did have one dog, though, who took his 'charge' as the alpha male dog extra seriously.  Even if I gave his pregnant mate a treat in front of him, and took him into a different room, he'd politely take his treat, go to his pregnant mate and give it to her.  Yes, he was an unusual dog ... but he was also very well trained.  He didn't start to eat his treats again until all of the puppies were given away, and his mate and he had both been 'fixed' ... but I'd still occasionally see him 'sneak a treat' and take it to her.  That is 'a true story' of two dogs who were 'truly in love' with each other!|`|EECePKs6aa	My yorkie is exactly like that 2!!!!! lol :D|`|UECCsRKvaa	easy eat it like she doesn't eat at all!!! lol|`|knyjNiy0aa	She would sneak up to it and stop half a foot away and look up at me and wait for a signal that it was okay to eat.

They have finally been shut down (thank god).|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	I live in Michigan, and apparently that law only applies to pet store owners. I think it should apply to everyone. But anyway, I think that these laws are great and a very good idea.|`|eDySIDPQaa	While Texas is not mandated for this.......people still get fined and can get jail time for selling underage pups, and our Humane Society enforces it if your caught..    Wish every state would do this..|`|rnFYdZ0yaa	wow thats crazy!|`|hwxeQCdDaa	why is it then that every hunting dog trainer tells you pick up your dog on the 49th day.    We picked our guy on the 49th day and it could not have been a better decision. Our other hunting dog was picked up at 11 weeks and he has been a lot harder to train.    I think it depends on the breed of dog.|`|3C5PvsB8aa	I also live in Texas and to my knowledge there is no such law, though there should be.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	Unfortunately, in my state, the 8 week sale age law only applies to those who operate pet shops :c(  Wish they would nail the general public.

She's very cute though! My puppy has the exact same toy as that except it's white. I thought I'd share that. :D|`|PImvmP1paa	I'd say 3.     A family friend has this same kind of dog. His name is Jet. :)|`|BDRIeLqUaa	oh my gosh- a lady never reveals her age|`|ui2x6jUqaa	7 months|`|CNer40Xhaa	two or three years old|`|ocwetmQuaa	Seven to 9 month old beauty.
OKiMkaxGaa	Rural pounds are pretty bad. In a town somewhat near me, their policy for strays is:    If it isn't claimed in 72 hours, the pound keeper can:    a) dispose of it however he wants (*shivers*)  b) have it destroyed by a vet or bylaw officer  c) ship it to a "educational" facility to have it vivisected on! (What if that was your beloved pet!)  d) or adopt it out/sell it|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	I would think rural shelters are worse off. Less money & more stray animals to be dealt with. And fewer people adopt.|`|PdotFx4naa	It depends on what you're talking about.  The dogs are worse off in both.  Most rural shelters have dogs for years before they are (if at all) adopted out.  The inner-city ones adopt more pets but a lot of them also have a high kill rate too.    The dogs may have found a home at the rural shelters but it's not a true home and it's sad to hear about the ones who have been in these shelters for years.|`|cETQuE9waa	Right now I think that all shelters are having a hard time because the economy is so bad.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You really can't generalize like that.    For example, I live in Colorado and we actually have to import from outside the state to keep our shelters and rescues filled with enough animals to meet the demand.  (Weird, I know, but ... ).  Not all state are like this, apparently, but here it really doesn't matter if a dog winds up in a rural or urban shelter.  If a shelter is overstocked, dogs just get moved to another shelter.|`|velIdcbNaa	If you think about it it's bad either way.  They don't have a home, and some of them are killed in each of them  I have seen decent shelters, but none of them have been very good.  The bigger city ones are kept up a little more because they need to get the donations and make the budget cut, and the rural ones still have to worry about the same thing.  I got my dog from a rural shelter, and she was near death.  She was extremely emaciated, she had pneumonia, kennel cough, basically everything except for parvo, and distemper.  And it's not like they had got her that way either.  She had been in there since she was a pup and was never adopted out.  It's hard on all of the animals and I strongly suggest that if you have to get rid of a pet, don't dump them on the street, but try to find someone to take them.  It's not a very good shelter life, and there is a big chance that they will be put down because lack of funds.  If you really want to get a better understanding, go and walk through one.  It's a life changing experience.

PdotFx4naa	It's not good for them.  They don't get enough nutrition from it.  Wal-Mart has milk replacer for puppies and it even comes with a little bottle and all.  Mother's milk is the most important though.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	no  buy puppy formula  pet store|`|KJCwUW6Laa	some can others cant maybe try giving them a tiny bit|`|CSmc9AyGaa	No, i can make them sick. try going to the pet shop they hve formulated puppy milk|`|YKXU3rl4aa	no they cant drink normal milk, u need a special milk from a pet store, dont worry it is cheap. u need the milk from the puppies' mom.|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, my mom is like a huge dog person and  i have grew up knowing alot about dogs. But  my mom when she has little baby puppies she  gets some kind of goat milk i think that was what  it was called. Which my mom said she wouldn't  use are kind of milk. So go out and buy goat milk  not just regular milk.|`|5gsyZ6hiaa	dogs need dog food lol|`|MkD3wMUlaa	no we don't think sooo  it probably would prefer water more likely,its Mommy's milk|`|crS1HZ9vaa	puppies or adults should not drink milk for human comsumption because it will give them a severe  case of diarhea and they could dyhdrate and die. As for the mother dog leaving them that is normal every day that passes she will leave them more and more but as long as she don't abandom them it is fine. best way to know that they are being fed just look in their whelping box if they are all snuggled together and twitching they are getting their fair share of milk and everything is fine.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Puppies should NEVER be fed any cow's milk, nor should any dog get it.  Milk gives dogs and puppies diarrhea, and diarrhea can kill puppies and many dogs.  If your mother dog can't nurse her puppies and they aren't eating good dog food, you should go to any pet store (the larger the better in this case) and ask for Puppy Formula.  That is a 'milky product that is as close to a mother dog's milk as possible, and should be given according to the directions on the can.  When a puppy is older (6 months, at least) you may give the dog a few licks of ice cream as a 'special treat' ... but don't give them that more than once a month, and only if the dog is on the best (and, unfortunately, most expensive) dog food plus gets 'regular' treats from the 'human plate ... mainly meat with some greens or vegetables, and occasional oil or margarine on bread.  Milk is like feeding your puppy POISON!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	NO not unless you want to kill them. Go buy formula from the pet store.      If your 12 your not allowed to ask questions on here so that leads me to believe you forged your birthday when registering. YAHOO PROHIBITS ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 13 TO ASK OR ANSWER. Read the guidelines.    as yahoo states  For safety reasons, children under the age of 13 are not permitted to ask or answer questions on Yahoo! Answers.|`|gjD8pndjaa	No!    You can buy puppy formula substitute from a pet store, however|`|Qh01Ey7Daa	Yeah.  But don't give them TOO much.  They might get diarrhea.|`|KnypnLfxaa	no,Got to the VET and get some milk.|`|UECCsRKvaa	i don't think so i think it has to be a certain type of formula. my dad said he found some puppy formula at some store, so if they're real little,look around.|`|rnW8h3vCaa	http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/...    http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-45.htm|`|UyAGXNCsaa	No.  Where's mom dog?|`|Xi94q0HKaa	wtf no girl|`|KxjUim7yaa	No. Some people have used goat's milk. The best is the specific puppy milk replacer.|`|VQX9e0mxaa	its a bad idea, because that milk was made for humans, and the only milk puppies should drink is from their mother. Water is the best choice for a beverage for animals|`|S7br6X8oaa	yeah even though some people say it is really bad for dogs and puppies all 4 of my dogs have been drinking reg. milk since they were little and they're fine in fact one of them is turning 4 this year and the other 3 turned 8 in October. That's 56 in dog years. Don't give it to them if they are like only a few days/weeks old. We started to give it to our dogs around like 3 to 4 months. I would start with formula if you breed your dog and that is where you got the pups.|`|velIdcbNaa	No cows milk isn't good for animals besides calves.  If you need to feed them milk because of complications then you can go to Wal Mart and get the formula for infant animals, or ask your veterinarian for some.|`|pFBaMlI8aa	puppies should not drink milk except for from their mother. you shouldn't even feed grown dogs milk, it gives them diarrhea and an upset stomach. its not fatal or anything, but their stomachs will hurt for about a day. give your puppies regular water, it's the only drink that dogs should have.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No .. usually it gives them the runs.|`|voaMM1GQaa	Bad for them, Nasty gas and poop.|`|sfUUml0Daa	its not good for them, not enough nutrients, and theyll probs get diareah. try powderd formula from the pet store just measure and mix then feed the hungry lil puppies :D|`|1Foz82Mqaa	don't give them toooo much.      and mix it with a lot of water.|`|3Z9mdFVxaa	not really they are in word lactoseintalllerant they can't drink milk it makes them sick|`|THFg2r31aa	no they cant. i heard that most dogs are lactose intolerant, meaning they cant digest milk products. but ask your vet just in case!   good luck handling them :)
F27az9NEaa	Take her to the shelter with you and have her meet some of the dogs. Perhaps educate her on the breed (get books and magazines) and try to warm her up to it. You could also tell her that most 'pit bulls' aren't even purebred anymore, they're mixed with other breeds to get that 'bully style' look. If you live in the United States, you and your mom can visit http://www.petfinder.com to view dogs for adoption of all breeds, and their mixes. Perhaps you'll both find one you agree with.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Um...does she know how many 'purebred' pits are in shelters? We have two in ours right now, one big beautiful brindle boy and a red and white one. Those are the most euthanized breeds. If she truly likes pits than she should want to rescue the ones that are already here.    Good for you for volunteering at an animal rescue.|`|PGkbPBZmaa	There are TONS of purebread pits in shelters. Most Humane Societys have mostly pits, and a lot of them are purebred. Tell your mom that shelter dogs are great because a lot of them are already potty trained, pure bred, and they've passed behavioral tests to be able to get adopted.  Plus, they already have their shots, and are almost always already spayed or neutered. They are well rounded usually, because they've been exposed to other dogs at the shelter, and various people.|`|Bw18seFqaa	you can find purebreds at the shelter.    I dont think the problem is convincing mom to adopt..  I think your problem is convinving her to get the breed that you want.|`|t1OISAadaa	tell her its saving a dogs life they uthinize shelter dogs if they cant be adopted soooo help them they need a home more than other dogs    btw love the name    My names katelyn|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Well im sure she only likes them because they are PUREBRED and she likes Bragging. Well you should make her watch a Video of Dogs being put to sleep. That might change her mind. Plus you can get Pit buls, from rescue center's wich are purebred just like a animal shelter. Did she know that Alot of animal shelters have full blooded pits because they are rescued from Fighters.I think you should tell her That,make her watch a video,and maybe it will Convince her then. I am glad you want to help unlike your mom. 25 mill are put to sleep a year that dosnt even count the ones that Starve,are killed,hit by cars,ect...      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMR9scfrs...        http://www.pbrc.net/      hope this helps|`|3dccLgsyaa	There is a rescue for every breed.  I bet there is one in your area.  It is just as good to get a pet from a rescue as a shelter, because rescues often pull pets out of shelters so that they don't get euthanized.  I think it is very awesome that you will be volunteering at ARF.  Way to go, good for you!!!|`|G1pt12flaa	because shelter dogs are just like dogs in pet stores only in better shape they are also cuter|`|a6an2aN0aa	There are many purebred dogs at the shelter - especially Pit Bulls.    Who's going to be taking care of the dog more? I think that person should get to pick the breed.|`|NTqDEeShaa	tell her this  adopting a dog is better than buying one because if they dont get adopted never in their lives they will die there and why buy a dog that already has an owner  dont u ever see the comercials on TV that adopting a dog is better than buying one|`|EeBpGOQPaa	Its great that you wanna adopt from a shelter  there are so many pets in shelters today that deserve a good home  just tell you mom how much you want to help these dogs and give one a chance, its horrible to know whats gonna happen after a dogs in a shelter to long..there put to sleep.   try to get on your moms sensitive side when telling her how much you want a shelter dog.    hope you get your do|`|56ba25da115adfe2c7df170b693a1437aa	It is GREAT you want a shelter dog.  Sooooo many dogs are in need of a home.  They may not be purebred, but they are usually good, loyal, and wonderful pets.  If you are not interested in breeding purebred species, and just want this dog for a pet, getting a shelter dog is absolutely the best option.  You like them, and they need good homes.  I have several.|`|1pVNBsokaa	Your problem may be that  1 she doesn't think you can take care of it and you must prove it to her    2 she just thinks chihuahuas look stupid    3 Or she really hates shelter dogs and then make her feel guilty about it
XagPxe7Faa	There is nothing wrong with feeding your little one homecooked food...IF it is a proper diet for him.  If you want to switch him over to kibble, then determine what his specific dietary needs are and choose a quality food.  Mix in home cooked food with the kibble and gradually increase the ratio of the two in favor of the kibble.  I would NOT recommend swapping him cold turkey and expecting him to eat when he gets hungry enough.  A sudden change in eating patterns can cause digestive upset and in turn intestinal inflamation and nasty bacterial infections.|`|cfCtMsnzaa	there are wet dog food packets you can buy. start by giving him that with Little dry food mixed in. gradually add more dry dog food and eventually the wet food can become a weekly treat and then a monthly treat.....its important to do it gradual...a sudden change can affect the dogs metabolism and mood.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	He needs to eat good DOG food - I have never seen a dog that was fed human food that looked healthy.  You can mix a little human food in with the dog food at first, if you like, but make sure he is eating more dog food than people food.    I had a Papillion that refused to eat dog food when I first got her. So I bought her Biljac (a dogfood that has kibble that is extruded, so it is softer, and has a stronger smell than most), and I mixed a little canned food with it, to make it more interesting.  Eventually she learned to eat kibble without anything mixed in (which I prefer to feed, since it is better for the dogs teeth.)  Biljac is a very small, soft kibble, so it would be good for a small dog like your Yorkie.  I found mine at Petsmart.|`|FsozOO6Zaa	You can stop automatically and I'm sure sooner or later it will be hungry and eat it's dog kibbles. or you can slowly add some human food in with the kibbles or try to get different things to make the kibbles better. like wet dog food, or this weird BBQ sauce to put on it or anything else! you can always try giving your dog bones or other types of dog treats
uBFhKXgHaa	No, it's not good. It's a low quality dog food.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (Excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Even more!)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs. BARF Diet)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...  (Learn how to determine the quality of your dog's food.)  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_... (Dog food reviews. Four stars is a decent food, five stars is a great food, and six stars is an excellent food.)      Darksong~|`|sFXv9TIyaa	The best thing you could do is read the ingrediants label and see whats in the dog food.Make sure it has no "meat by-products" in them (which is pretty much feet and feathers ground up)...One made up of Chicken, Chicken Meal, Veges and rice would be good.    I recommend "Nutra Gold" and "Nutrience".|`|O2lCgtvmaa	Yes I think it's a good brand. When shopping for dog food, check the ingredients. It should have absolutely NO by-products, and the first ingredient should be chicken, lamb, etc. A really good brand that I like is Eukanuba Naturals.
yVHx4hxraa	Do you have a humidifier in your home?  Sounds as if your air may be a little dry.  That may help if the dryer sheet hasn't.  Spraying the bed with Static Guard might also be another option.

Then we stick a couple long treats in the end of it so they stick out some. Then we freeze them. The dogs love it!    Also what I do a lot other than peanut butter is buy some plain Yogurt and stick some fruit in it and then freeze it. My dog goes crazy for fruit and yogurt and it's healthy too.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	Find a dog biscuit that is thin but long, like in the shape of a bone. You can stick it in lengthwise but shake the kong to lodge it inside the cone in a way that makes it stuck in place. You can also cut pieces of carrot and/or apple and do the same thing. Another cool trick is freezing the stuffed kong. You seal the small hole with peanut butter, then you can put whatever else you want inside, from kibble to little cut up pieces of low fat turkey hot dog to dog biscuits. Top it off with more peanut butter and freeze it overnight. That will keep the dog interested and occupied for a long time.|`|IP8vzLuBaa	I put large milk bones in then some peanut butter.  works great!|`|JM4Uiunqaa	you can use peanut butter or pumpkin (canned plain pumpkin, not pie filling) to make the treats/kibble stick and stay in the kong. We actually made some pumpkin and pureed liver treats and stuff them in kongs for our dogs. The treats are frozen and oddle shaped so it takes some work to get them out. The dogs LOVE them and they are cheap and easy to make. You could even make little pucks of frozen ground meat to stuff in there.|`|FdcWPp48aa	My rottweiler gets her kong with slices of turkey dogs and cheese.

Q13PQlz9aa	Very sad indeed, but yes, I think it's time.  The poor thing doesn't need to suffer any longer just to keep you company.  I know it will be VERY hard, but cancer is causing the poor thing misery, and you shouldn't prolong it anymore.  God Bless you for asking for advice on this difficult subject.  Best of luck to you, and remember, there will never be another cat like your's, but there are many more that need a loving home.      Take care|`|kH0AsPfgaa	I'm sorry about your cat. I put mine down last year.  Keep in mind, cats do throw up on occasion so it may not be the cancer.  If he seems unhappy or in pain, and doesn't enjoy being held or whatever he liked before, then it's time to talk to the vet.  They will give you honest feedback.  Good luck.|`|xR5mCcD8aa	If you feel like he's suffering then i think it's time.he will rest in peace after.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	I agree with Snow Leopard. When a cat has been a member of your family for so long, you know when he is suffering. I had a 15 year old cat that was suffering from kidney failure. For a week, I took in to the vet daily for iv fluids. My baby even got a little more perky and happy BUT after a few days both myself and the vet knew it was time to let him go. He looked at me in a way that let me know he was just tired. It was one of the hardest things for me to do but I just knew it was the right time. It doesn't make it easier, I know, but somehow, your kitty will let you know.|`|AA10541863	This is not an easy question to answer. If he is suffering then you most definitely need to have him put down. Also, if there is nothing that the vet can do to save him, then its time. I feel for you and your precious cat. :( It is by no means an easy decision to make.     I had to have my sweet Siamese put down a few months ago and it was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made but I knew she wasn't going to be in pain anymore.    Good luck with your decision. You just do what you feel is right for him.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	You'll know in your heart and in his eyes when it's time to let go.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	Yes. You could wait until he is in so much pain that not even morphine helps, as we did with our cat, but if the vet says the cancer is terminal and he's started to show signs of discomfort I would not wait.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Hurry up and do it, he's sufering|`|vjww5cN7aa	It is probably best for him... If he truly looks depressed, I would probably do it.  :((( I'm so sorry for you.      Ask the vet. (S)he will know if it is time.    I'm sorry for your cat.|`|welQ5nSqaa	Yes it's time to put him down. My dog was 13 and we found out she had cancer for a few years and she started to lose her memory and started biting people she knew. Also I had a cat who was 18 and we ended up taking him to live at the vet because his tumors were so bad and they ended up putting him down.    It's better to not let them suffer. |`|378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	If you feel his quality of life is at stake, I would seriously contemplate euthanasia. I believe there are different options of how they perform that, one may be in the heart which will enable the cat to be out of his misery sooner.(this is what I asked for my guinea pig's euthanasia)  You know him better than me. Is he drinking, eating, urinating, etc normally? Do you feel he is happy here? Is he comfortable? How many ailments is he suffering due to this cancer? Is he like his old self? You probably do not want him in pain. Euthanasia in this case sounds like a gift to the cat. He will thank you for it. Blessings to you.
QVP8zSuWaa	I saw this earlier, I really don't know what I would have done to them if I had been that person. It kinda scares me when I think how mad it makes me.  I did woop a rather large man up the side his head with a pole for beating a puppy once. It didn't knock him out but I think he was in shock that a wowan knocked the sh@@t out of him  They need to be locked up since most of them will go on to kill people.|`|tNfjre0Laa	throw bananas at them?|`|UyAGXNCsaa	I read the title and couldn't read any more.  All I can say is where are the parents?  That's sick - very disturbing.|`|gjD8pndjaa	spay and neuter.|`|5m2MuJ6paa	holy crap! i think that is a horrible thing to do! i think that those kids should be punished very extremely! cause if they arent then they will grow up to do worse things then that.|`|JsBb732Maa	The kids need therapy, maybe a lock down facility. I have also read that serial killers do torture animals and that's a place the no caring about the feelings of live things start. It's really scary that kids can do this and the parents need to answer as to where they were at the time this was going on.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	The sad thing is, is that they will continue to do  stuff like that because there in gangs and can't get out with out getting hurt themselves|`|KnypnLfxaa	What a shame!!  many dogs die on the streets a day.  MAN,how many died?|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I think we should start running into the council estates and randomly spiking the water supply with contraceptives.    Sorry, I dont mean to be elitist or whatever, I live in a pretty rough area myself, but as I have done so I've seen soooooooo many parents who just look on their children as mistakes...you can see it in the way they treat the kids...they just keep breeding and breeding for more benefits while the kids run around like a pack of wolves, using up perfectly good oxygen. It must be pretty hard for kids to grow up with respect for life with parents like that. They are no doubt sick and twisted and need locking up, but I doubt its genetic, its obviously something in the way they are being raised.    Those puppies are beautiful though, whats good is that it will probably have a happy ending for them, there will be people tripping over themselves to adopt such beautiful puppies.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Public executions.  Unfortunately too many people get away with things like this.|`|ESzlhwoDaa	Wow... that is absolutely horrid. People like this should be disciplined, even if they're children. Treating any creature like that is unacceptable.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	That is true.    Their parents obviously didn't teach them to respect animals. It's very sad that there are people like this around, but what to do? I don't know. You can't really give a ten-year-old full responsibility for their actions.|`|PdotFx4naa	Really, what can we do?  It's sad but it lies in the parents' hands.  The parents have no control of their kids nowadays!  The laws are so strict now that people are not allowed to even give a swat when the kids are bad.  Everyone wonders why kids are such brats and have no respect for anything or anyone!|`|NGk5IrWWaa	ayayay thats terrible, they need therapy. they obviously are sick in the head. and they are too young for punishment, they can still be fixed, unless theyre sociopaths. then they're kinda screwed.|`|GSb3FM19aa	that is DISGUSTING to kill an animal for food if you need it is ok with me but for fun is horrible and evil they are defiantly old enough to know what they were doing i've also heard that serial killers start off by hurting animals first its like they get a weird kick of it!!    sorry couldn't even read it after looking at just the title!|`|cl6r8cGBaa	how could they do that? the thought of that is so unbearable, i dont know what would justify their actions, but they deserve to be in jail!|`|JREyMH4zaa	I agree..serial killers have been known to torture and kill pets then worked up to humans..These kids need some serious help.  Good thing it wasn't me that seen it..their little behinds would still have my foot print.|`|iLIsQgIUaa	i think if they treat animals like that, they should be treated the same way. so if they keep a dog locked up with no food and water etc then that should happen to them.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Wow, that made my jaw drop, literally. That's just sick. They need to make more harsh laws for animal cruelty...=/|`|YsMbKwTwaa	This is terrible, i think these kids should go to jail for at least a few  months. How could people do  this! I'm just very  angry right  now. Like who in the right mind would even imagine doing something like that. wow is all i can say.|`|gGQssXS1aa	Well, i know what I would like to do with them.  But it`s unprintable!!|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	My god, How sick can people be?! This is so sad!   I'm just speechless!! They deserve some major punishment!!|`|KLfx3JQYaa	Those bast**d kids should be tortured then put in jail.  Dont give me that s*** that "they're just kids. they don't know what they were doing." I think when kids do felonies they should get punished as much as any adult.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Personally I'd roast them slowly over a fire - they'd get first hand experience on what happens when you try that instead of using puppies for their experiments...|`|CCLLnSrGaa	do the same to them,dont care how old they are|`|pFNhhAgRaa	I think with any animal cruelty case we should do to them exactly what they did to the animals so they know how it feels.|`|2g1KEptwaa	Treat them--they've been serially abused. The parents have got to be taken into custody and asked a few questions, like how often do you F*** them? Because they have been--nothing but horrendous abuse can stunt a person's responses like that. As you say, that's how a lot psychpaths start off.|`|AA10895799	I did not look at the clip.  I understand it is about animal cruelty.  If a child does not have the opportunity to care for animals such as kids raised in the projects and many apt complexes, that child will not learn to appreciate animals as being worthy of affection.  An animal to such a child is just a food source, or something , an object to look at to to react to. There are laws so enforce the ones on the book.  To prevent animal abuse, like child abuse, one has to provide for the potential abuser an opportunity to develop in another way.  Remember, the notorious serial killer, Jeffrey Dahmer was killing and dismembering animals and wearing their skulls around his neck, and because he came from a so-called good family and neighborhood, he was not even reprimanded.  No one apparently even foresaw that as a problem.|`|FUFD3MhQaa	Euthanasia|`|bIaywrBCaa	They need to spend time in juvenile hall, plus be required to work in the animal shelters as community service, of course well supervised. And the parents should have to pay a harsh fine because there is something wrong in the upbringing that makes kids do these things.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I think they should by trialed as juveniles and sent to a juvenile detention center for as many years as they can.|`|fgxajTiBaa	We should euthanize them straight off. You are absolutely right about serial killers starting off by hurting/killing animals. Anyone who would harm a defenseless creature shouldn't be trusted in our society.    That story makes me sick...|`|MRijAWJRaa	call their parents and tell them that your child is evil!
8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	You're asking us - you should be asking your mom. I'm sure she has certain standards that she would be willing to discuss with you. But as a mother, I would say don't mouth off, do your chores, homework, and continue even after you get the dog. It would be worst than not getting the dog at all if you got it and then let your mother down so that she made you give it up.  As much as you want the dog, that dog is going to become attched to you. So Please, Please, Please, keep your word to your mom and do what you should.|`|JsBb732Maa	Be nice and do all your chores.|`|KnypnLfxaa	DO lots dishes,clean the bathroom,keep your room "sparkling",  thank your mom,clean the house,do the rest that your family has not got to.(laundry,dusting,ect.)
PM23RDycaa	How much would each of them be fed a day? -the bostons would each get 0.4 pounds (6.4 ounces) per day total (2% of their weight) and the other would get 0.2 pounds (3.2 ounces) per day total at the same ratio.    What meats are ok for them to eat? I would be wary of feeding raw pork or chicken because of the effects it has on humans. Do these apply to dogs? Nope. With pork you have to work about fat content but that can be trimmed. You can feed them whatever you can reasonable get your hands on, that they aren't allergic to and like. From chicken to water buffalo    Trichinosis is almost impossible to be found in the current pork supply. Its now against FDA regs to feed pigs garbage and refuse. Trich would be more likely found in wild game from certain areas. That's why if you get it fresh you are to freeze it first.    Where would we get it from? Your local grocery store, farmer's market, butcher, meat packers, there are a few companies that sell meat specially for the raw feeder Prey4Pets, Hare Today, and many others      What is the ratio of kibble-meat-veggies to feed? Kibble one meal raw the other. Raw and kibble digest at different rates so IF you are going to feed both its better to feed them at separate meals. Me personally I go for franken prey /prey model - no veggies you can sub out the veggies by feeding green tripe Your raw ratio should be around 80% meat 10% raw meaty bone and 10% organs half needs to be liver    http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawCh...  http://www.rawfeddogs.net/  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html  http://www.mypetcarnivore.com/rawfeeding...

Todays dogs that we have as pets, have not been consuming and building defenses to the organisms and bateria present in raw meat. Giving a dog small bits of cooked meat leftover you dont want to eat is ok in tiny amounts, considering your raw toss away suitable for a loving pet is not.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	I starred this for some of my raw feeding contacts, but I'll start you off with some great websites to utilize for research:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Raw Fed Dogs)  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/ (Raw Meaty Bones)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

Raw pork and raw chicken are commonly fed when raw feedings.     I feed chicken as a staple and pork when I can find it cheap.     What you want to do to start with is pick one meat and bone piece like chicken quarters, remove the skin and fat and feed that for a week or until stool is solid. Once stool is solid, start adding in the fat and skin. Once stool is firm with that, you want to feed that for a week to give the system a rest.   Note: I didnt get into feeding organs until a month after starting raw.   Once that time is over, you can start slowly adding in organ. Your dogs are small so they dont need very much organ.     The general guideline is 80% muscle meat, 10% bone, and 10% organ half of which has to be liver) I just feed all 10% liver.     Feed 2 to 3 percent of their body weight.   The Bostons would eat around 6.4 ounces and the It. greyhound mix would eat around 3.2 ounces.     If you are in a developed country, any meats ok to feed.     Here is a good forum that convinced me raw feeding was the best way to go, they can really help you get started and keep you going once you start.   http://www.bigdogsporch.com|`|rfwjZawqaa	Your best bet is to talk to your vet. Most discourage raw feeding, but they can still give you advice on what they can and can't eat. You can tell if you are feeding to much or to little by watching their bodies. If they seem to be gaining weight, cut back a little and if they are looking a little thinner, up the amount. You can get books about raw feeding at most major bookstores or do your research online. Raw diets need to be taken seriously. Don't take it up if you can't commit the time to doing it correctly. You can make your dog very sick and really mess them up. They need quality diets and you don't want to make them unhealthy because you didn't do your homework.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	There is a lot to know about feeding raw, so I suggest you find an informative website, or buy a book. They will tell you everything you need to know in better detail that you can find on Y!A.  I personally use 'Raw Dog Food - Make It Easy For You and Your Dog' by Carina Beth MacDonald as a reference.|`|crlXvjXOaa	I have two pet greyhounds. Their diet consists of equal parts raw chicken beef or lamb human grade, (If not human grade always freeze then defrost before giving to dogs to kill any parasites that may be present, I don't use pork because of the fat content which can cause pancreatitis in dogs.) cooked vegies rice and pasta supplemented with quality dry kibble. The odd sardines, an occasional egg and fruit such as banana cantelope, not grapes as these are toxic.   Our dogs are in peak condition with glossy coats, healthy weight, good teeth (for greyhounds). This says a lot as my male has a number of health problems but is still going strong at 10. Just be conscious  if you plan to change the diet do it gradually as sudden changes can cause stomach upsets.
8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	If your dog is not a natural drooler, check for the following:    Nausea.  This could be caused by something he ate or motion sickness.  Sometimes mixing lots of different kinds of foods together, giving your dog heavily spiced foods or too much food can cause gastric upset.  In any case, you should prepare for vomiting.  If you're in the car, this would be a good time to pull over and let your dog walk a bit.       Mouth problems.  This could be caused by something lodged in his mouth like a piece of bone or a wood splinter.  It could also be caused by a tooth or gum problem.     Poisoning or disease.  Check immediately for anything odd that your dog licked or ingested.      If drooling is unusual for your dog, you cannot find the cause or it is accompanied by other unusual symptoms, it's best to contact your vet immediately.|`|WMem5AGoaa	SERIOUS... take her to the vet ASAP,especially if she's a SENIOR dog.|`|MRijAWJRaa	go ask your vet|`|Gnhgfx4naa	Something is wrong she needs a vet now|`|JsBb732Maa	Smells something tasty.|`|KnypnLfxaa	Its vet time!  lets go doggie!!|`|cETQuE9waa	I would get her to a vet it sounds serious.|`|V9YC5FK7aa	take her to the vet|`|plGuYnNDaa	Try getting her to drink some water.

Expressing the anal glands is something usually done at the groomer and can be done at the vets.  You could do it yourself, but it takes practice and patience.  What you'll need to do is place your thumb and pointer finger at 10:00 and 3:00 and feel for two little balls. When you feel them, squeeze gently and the liquid should come out.  This is something you'll want to do outside since the liquid does smell horrible, you may want to wear gloves and have a towel handy to wipe away the mess.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	Take him to a vet or a professional groomer.

RPTwjyjIaa	Newfy :)  Newfoundland    Sorry did not see the second part of your question at first.    Show them how responsible you are. Save up money to get the dog yourself, buy its collar, leash, food and water bowl, etc. Have some way to keep paying the cost like vet bills (just basics like shots, check ups, and to get the puppy fixed) and puppy classes. Even having a babysitter job or dog walking job or pet sitting job will cover these cost. Also do your research and have answers ready on why you want this dog and what you know about this breed.

Alternatively, you could ask somebody else who knows them, like a friend who's often over at your house.|`|P7f346v8aa	I'm not after points.  What's perfect in my eyes may not be perfect in your eyes.  We are different....that's what makes us individual.    The first breed that comes to my mind when I think of "large" and "water loving" is the Newfoundland.      Talking your parents into something?  That's not my department, my dear. It would be unfair to your parents to quote the words of a stranger.|`|GtaOjaYcaa	I have 2 greats dane and one is huge! haha if a great dane is tooo big, there are smaller ones. Our other dane is alot smaller. they are both males which is usually hard to find a small male :] but females always run smaller. We also have a house on the lake and both of them love to go swimming and same with our friends danes. People dont like them because they "look" intimidating but they are actual gentle giants. If you dont like that big of a dog, i would suggest a shepherd mix. they can vary in different sizes and usually love water. And for your second question.  My mom is a hard one to persuade but im an expert:] haha so alittle advice, i would start looking at ads in the paper, online, and animal shelters like all the time! pick out your favorite and DONT stop talking about them! Then, make a list online of things you would need, pick out some cute things, pick out a name and make sure your house is ALWAYS clean. take care of any animals you already have and show your responsible! To get my horse, i had to print up 50 pictures of him and tape them all over my dads house.   Hope this helps :]]]]
lTeXIjpOaa	people can be very stupid sometimes, as a 4-h leader i have seen many young kids on big horses that they cant handle and parents get upset because they dont show well, at the fairgrounds we show at the kids are pretty good about conducting traffic in the warm-up arena and someone will call out to change directions when they have been going one way for a while, then the kids will all switch directions; people should not take a green horse to a show and expect to train it their, training should be done before you go to a show and crops and spurs should only be given to riders that can ride well without them, i told my step daughter that if she cant ride without a crop she definately isnt going to ride with one|`|8bTder08aa	"...thus giving her daughter a crop and told her to catch him and wack him with the crop untill he coward [sic]  roughly 7 people were watching this...."    And not one of the seven people intervened?  If this was happening on show grounds, I would have yelled at the people concerned that I was going to report them to the showgrounds management, and then I would have done exactly that.    FWIW, when I was showing, I saw lots of idiocy taking place, both inside and outside the show ring/warm up ring, and involving people who were spectators, competitors, grooms, trainers, and people who just happened to be wandering by.  You can't stop them all, you just have to watch out for them and if possible courteously suggest they do something different.      Cruelty though, people have an obligation to intervene.  I would think that if the abuse you mentioned happened on show ground, the show management would have been anxious to stop it and maybe sanction the woman and her daughter, because they might lose the right to use the show grounds.|`|9UttDvcsaa	My daughter is 4 and is already doing a posting trot on her paint pony.  She has to ride him with a crop or he will stop and not move AT ALL.  It isn't a matter of training because if I get on him or someone with legs that hang past the saddle he is excellent.  It is unfair of you to say that parents are stupid for letting their children ride with crops.  She does not abuse her pony.  She rides with her legs, asks him and then taps him with the crop,  I show quite a bit and don't have a problem going around anyone.  I don't care if people are going the wrong way everyone has to warm up their horses both ways and show at different times.  I don't agree with anyone beating a horse but in most cases children that are small will need aids to ride and most of them have been taught how to use them in my opinion.  I am not incredibly stupid....if my daughter didn't use a crop, she wouldn't be able to go anywhere and our pony is very well trained and likes his job he just needs to be asked differently by her.  Don't stereotype the good Moms and trainers.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Shows are they not just so much fun?    This one girl I use to ride with got an eight year old horse who was never broke. She broke and trained the horse herself for Westren then 2 weeks before a show she started traing the horse for Hunter/jumper. She brougth the horse to the show braging how she had only had him for a couple months and he never gives her the same ride, and he was only training in H/J for 2 weeks. This horse was taking off with her left and right. She ran into two other horses in the warm up ring and this horse ran out of the ring 3 times with her. She was using spurs and a crop while he was freaking out. *head against wall*    A few months ago I was riding a OTTB in a show. She is a 17 year old sweet heart, and I ride her all the time. This was only her 2nd show in about 3 years and she was showing a little bit of her TB mare side. These two people who though the owned the ring kept cutting me off and nearly running into her. This made the horse mad and she would toss her head and pin her ears at them. It was muddy out so we could not warm up outside. These people had the nerve to tell me that I needed to get a pony I could accualy handle and the the real horses to the adults. Both these people are only 17ish and have only been riding for 4 years. I know them from working at shows. I have been riding for 7 years and knew how to keep the mare calm and not let her freak out.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	AH yes, horse shows. Sometimes I wonder why i do them. Undoubtedly something will go wrong and someone will cry, and then I will get angry because i hate crying. Honestly, people just chill out and calm down. LOL. 'Some' horse people and trainers are as bad a stage moms. But then again if you can't take the heat stay out of the show ring. I just nod and smile and mind my own business.

There are two main types of collapse that dogs can suffer though both can have diverse causes. The first is fainting, when your dog simply drops goes completely limp and appears to be dead. The second is an epileptic fit, where your dog loses consciousness and drops but is rigid and twitching or shaking all over.  Normally a collapse will last from a few seconds up to a few minutes.|`|gNHFrbz6aa	I heard that before on t.v and it is no so good...|`|J1wBYfMCaa	My Toy Poodle 14 years does this when excited he has moderate conjestive heart falure Dogs may also be born with heart defects

Are you asking: How do I get my Dog to bark up the tree at the Squirrel?      If that is your question, this is something you DON"T want to teach your dog to do.  If you start teaching him/her to bark up a tree, you are going to promote his prey drive.  You will then have a dog barking at everything walking by.  You will also have hard time walking the dog because if he sees a squirrel, he will get over excited, pull you so that he can run after it.    It is not a good thing.
AA10982839	1.  Flick the cat on the nose with a stern "No" or "No bite"    2.  Hold the head down to the floor like the mother would with a stern "No"    3.

1abf65c656433557a6106d5df2cb12d6aa	Don't worry about getting your dog to eat more.  Take him to a vet he could have a cavity (That happens to dogs when you feed them soft without giving them something hard to eat or chew on).  He needs to have his teeth looked at, it may be that you think he is a picky eater, but it could be hurting him whenever he eats.  Also to prevent cavities you can always mix half dry dog food with half soft dog food. That is what I do :)|`|aad1a4af73e641a005a5cf6207ea13eaaa	Check out the source below for a checklist that may help you identify why he does not eat.

I feed my dogs once a day and I measure out each meal according to the dogs weight.  Don't over feed dogs and never feed off the table.  If he doesn't eat it right away then pick it up and put in the refrig. for the next days meal.  No snacks during the day unless you use snacks as a reward in training.

I have seen them anywhere from $2.00 each, 3 for $10 and $5 each, $7 each, $10, each and $12. each.. Please get more than one as they do live in large colonies in the wild and will thrive with at least a friend if not they will not live long.    The actual cost is not the hermit crab it's self BUT the proper set up. As mentioned above a $12 starter kit set-up will be exactly what you are paying for a piece of CRAP! Starter kits are not good nor recommended because out of 10 pet stores 9 if not ALL have no clue about the proper care and keeping of them.. I have yet to find a pet store that knows what they are talking about when speaking on Land Hermit Crabs.    You must have a glass aquarium with a solid lid or standard aquarium hood with lights.... not wire mesh, not plastic mesh.. not a plastic container be-it a kritter Keeper or Hermit Crab Cove..    You need both a temperature guage AND humidity guage...   3 deep dishes/reptile dishes (the bigger the better), 2 for water and 1 for food.   You must have at least 3 extra shells per crab of the correct type, size, weight etc.   DO not buy Hermit Crab food if you want them to live for any amount of time.   Get marine or oceanic salt mix for salt water aquariums since they must have a dish of salt water.   Buy a piece of cork bark and cholla wood if you can, as well as a hidy which can be a fish tank decoration that they can hide in.  Get a brick of coco-fiber bedding like ecoearth.    Next is sand.. BUT do not buy it in the pet store.. go to wal-mart or home depot and get play sand.. 50 lbs for $2.25 or so. While at wal mart get bottled water since you can not use tap and treating water is a waste of money. Also go to the craft area and get some netting by the shells.. then hardware for shower caddies and suction cups with hooks which are the best thing for crab owners.    Hit their pet dept. and get a container of blood worms, krill, tubifex worms and high color fish flakes... last.. hit the produce dept and get grapes, apples, bananas, romaine lettuce, kale, tomatoes, carrots, melon or simple fruit mix that is pre cut, strawberries, cukes... then you can also buy a piece of fresh salmon, some shrimps with skins on, a clam or two, a piece of chicken and a piece of beef....    All of that food will last you a long time. At home you can also give them eggs with egg shells, unsalted nuts, rolled oats (non-instant) Plain cheerios, total flakes or Kashi cereal.    But you could also listen to the pet store people, and others who have no clue... and then have your crabs only live a few months to a year OR LESS. We have 15 and 10 year old crabs that we have had since they were tiny micro size... we have had 26 successful molts this year alone at a 100% success rate. We have 48 Land Hermits on site right now and have placed countless numbers into their forever homes elsewhere.    We have tanks with sustained ideal tank contitions as mini tropical ecosystems,  we have spent many years researching their proper care and keeping. They are not novelty or throw away pets but live exotic creatures.. and also.. they are not pet pets and do not like to be handled that much .. if you do take them out they will stress and die.. if you are looking for a pet to play with then Land hermit are not the pet for you.|`|AA12162939	wow its expensive where they live, im in ny worked at a pet shop a few months ago we have a full hermit crab set up for 12$'s     1-4$'s for the crab itself then 3$ for food, 2$'s for wter sponge 1$ for spray bottle and 4 for a small plastic tank, if you are in the ny area contact me and i can recoment the exact pet store!

AA11706151	The bag still smells like pee to him - throw it out or he will keep being attracted back to it.  Use a urine odor neutralizer sold at pet stores for cleaning. Never use ammonia - that smells like pee to a dog.    If he pees on anything else, go back to your housebreaking basics - before the problem becomes chronic.  Put him in a crate when you can't watch him, keep him on a leash and actively supervise him when he is loose in the house.

I was told by dog trainers that they are either marking their territory, or they think it's a good spot to pee. Either way, if he does this again, the best thing to do is to use vinegar to neutralize the smell. From there, I would definitely watch his behavior, and try to institute a rewards system so he knows that when he pees in the right spot, he gets a treat or something, or praise, and when he pees in a bad spot, he doesn't get any of this.    Also, do you use house breaking pads at all? I find that if your dog is in the habit of being alone for a while, and you would like to prevent accidents, this is a good preventative measure.|`|ef98ad677a49c7a99dd5bafd50ef7926aa	My beagle dog does the same thing, first of all, he always pees on plastic, and secondly, he always remarks his territory.

Start obedience classes ,for both dogs . you have to become the alfa person. watch the animal planet on TV look for a show call THE DOG WHISPERER. he also has a book out. in the mean time try to keep the 2 dogs apart. I would also keep a 6 ft leather leash on the boxer at all times it will slow him down and give you a few seconds to get him under control before he starts something. i would also use chain collar have someone at the pet store show you who to use properly. don't leave it on him unless you are there to watch . they can hang them selves with this type of collar|`|AA12063319	They are very territorial.

Se os rpteis j existiam antes e botavam ovos, lgico que j existiam ovos (de rpteis,  claro) antes das galinhas ou de qualquer tipo de ave. Com o tempo, atravs da evolu??o (quando estudares isso em biologia vais saber como, ou talvez nem saiba)  que as aves surgiram, saindo da gua. Se vc perceber, a evolu??o de qualquer reino de seres vivos parte da gua para a terra. A medida que s?o mais evoludos v?o precisando menos de gua para viver. Por exemplo, no reino animalia, os peixes e anfbios n?o vivem fora da gua. Os rpteis vivem na gua e na terra. As aves e mamferos vivem fora da gua. Assim ocorre tambm no reino pantae. As algas (que n?o s?o plantas, mas fazem parte da evolu??o delas) s vivem em gua. As briftas s se desenvolvem em ambientes bastante midos, na realidade, molhados. As pteridfitas precisam de umidade (sem ser ambientes molhados) para se desenvolver. J as gimnospermas e angiospermas n?o precisam de ambientes midos (isso n?o quer dizer que n?o precisam de gua, n...).  Bom, pra concluir tudo isso, O OVO NASCEU PRIMEIRO QUE A GALINHA.|`|de3e0408397adad8295508b84c5309c6aa	Esta pergunta  mais velha que sua av|`|AA11808736	O ovo !

Paper is a thin, flat material produced by the compression of fibers. The fibers used are usually natural and composed of cellulose. The most common source of these kinds of fibers is wood pulp from pulpwood trees, (largely softwoods) such as spruce. However, other vegetable fiber materials including cotton, hemp, linen, and rice may be used. Though generally considered a flexible material, the edges of paper sheets can act as very thin, fine-toothed saws, leading to paper cuts.  Manufacturing     International Paper Company: Kraft paper mill, located in Georgetown, South CarolinaWhether done by hand or with a paper machine, the paper making process has three simple steps:    Preparation of the fibers  The material to be used for making paper is first converted into pulp, a concentrated mixture of fibers suspended in liquid. The source of fiber is often natural (softwood or hardwood trees or other plants) or recycled, such as old corrugated boxes, newsprint, or mixed paper.    When best sheets materials are used to make paper, it is usually necessary to break down the lignin inside of the plant's cell walls. This is done via a chemical process, such as the Kraft process. These processes are not needed when breaking down recycled fibers, as the lignin has already been removed from the source material. If the lignin is retained in the pulp, the paper will yellow when exposed to air and light.    Pulp that has been broken down mechanically is often known as "groundwood pulp." The mechanical process to break down wood chips into pulp requires no chemicals. Since the lignin is not removed from mechanical pulp, yields are relatively high, approximately 90-98%. However, due to the aging issues indicated above, mechanical pulp is most often used for newspapers and other non-permanent goods.    Pulp that is broken down chemically is known as "chemical pulp." The main purpose of a chemical pulping process is to break down the chemical structure of lignin and render it soluble in a liquid (most often water) so it may be washed from the remaining fibers. Removing the lignin from wood chips also serves to break them apart into the fibers that compose pulp.    Recycled fibres do not need to be pulped in the conventional sense. These fibres have already been treated once, so instead they need a more gentle process to break the fibers apart while preserving their integrity.    Once the fibers have been extracted, they may also be bleached, dyed, or have additional ingredients added to alter the appearance of the final product. For example, Kaolin (or calcium carbonate) is added to produce the glossy papers typically used for magazines. The Kappa number indicates how much bleach is required to obtain a given whiteness.    Sheet formation  The pulp mixture is further diluted with water resulting in a very thin slurry. This dilute slurry is drained through a fine-mesh moving screen to form a fibrous web. A watermark may be impressed into the paper at this stage of the process. This mark is used on paper currency and other things. This moving web is pressed and dried into a continuous sheet of paper.    In the mould process, a quantity of pulp is placed into a form, with a wire-mesh base, so that the fibers form a sheet on the mesh and excess water can drain away. Pressure may be applied to help remove additional water. The paper may then be removed from the mould, wet or dry, and go on to further processing.    Most mass-produced paper is made using the continuous Fourdrinier process to form a reel or web of fibers in a thin sheet. When dried, this continuous web may be cut into rectangular sheets by slicing the web vertically and horizontally to the desired size. Standard sheet sizes are prescribed by governing bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).    Drying  After the paper web is produced, the water must be removed from it in order to create a usable product. This is accomplished through pressing and drying. The methods of doing so vary between the different processes used to make paper, but the concepts remain the same.    Pressing the sheet removes the water by force. Once the water is forced from the sheet, another absorbant material must be used to collect this water. On a paper machine this is called a felt (not to be confused with the traditional felt). When making paper by hand, a blotter sheet is used.    Drying involves using air and or heat to remove water from the paper sheet. In the earliest days of papermaking this was done by hanging the paper sheets like laundry. In more modern times, various forms of heated drying mechanisms are used. On the paper machine, the most common is the steam-heated can dryer. These dryer cans heat to temperatures above 200oF and are used in long sequences of more than 40 cans. The heat produced by these can easily dry the paper to less than 6% moisture.

Don't bring the puppy back in until business is done. I trained my puppy in less than a week using this method. If you have to be gone during the day use a crate for the puppy and also use it at night.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I would say the best way is to crate train, or make sure you are watching yoru dog at all times - no matter what.  Take the dog outside every hour (depending on age.. young puppies more often, and older pupies may be able to last longer) you can tell when they have to go.  Dogs usually don't want to soil their crate.  So you should hear some crying when they have to go out - but take them out every hour or two no matter what.  Give them a chance to go to the bathroom and if they don't bring them back in and back into the crate.  Keep doing this until they have gone to the bathroom and then they can come back in and stay out of the crate.  Make sure you keep an eye on them and don't let them have an accident.      Dogs have to go to the bathroom more after they have been active, and you should see how long after your dog eats that it has to go as each dog is different.  Young puppies won't be able to make it through the night, but I suggest it sleeping in a crate and you getting up a few times at night to let it out.      Good luck|`|70d8f0d72a7f423e9229bc28e96822e9aa	bring your dog out first thing in the am before it eats, then w/in 20 mins of eating then after it drinks & plays & before you go to bed, before you leave the house & the 1st thing you do when you come home is let it out. Then go buy a doggie door..|`|69b39bf7d317295b9731843d5736dc72aa	Feed meals on a regular schedule (dogs that eat all day, poop all day)  Be prepared to take the puppy outside to eliminate 10  20 minutes after eating, possibly sooner after drinking.  A puppy should have 1 cup (8 oz) water per 8  of body weight each day.  No water after 7 pm.  An ice cube or two will quench pups thirst without the attendant need to urinate.    Take, dont put, puppy outside on leash to your chosen spot, then drop the leash and stand on the handle (as in Settle) and ignore her.  Keep her in sight out of the corner of your eye, and as soon as she eliminates, calmly praise and/or pop a small treat in her mouth.    Use a specific command such as Hurry Up.    As soon as puppy finishes, PLAY!  At least 1-2 minutes, up to 5 (depending on the weather.)    Now bring puppy inside.  Play a little more then put in her safe area/crate.  Clean up your yard daily.  Its like flushing your dogs toilet for her.    If you catch pup eliminating inside, clap hands to startle & stop her, quickly but gently bring outside to her spot, then give her the potty command.    Never punish accidents!  When ya gotta go, ya gotta go!     Use an odor neutralizer such as Natures Miracle or Spot Shot to eliminate the odor and any staining on carpet.  For liquids, put paper towel over the spot, then cover towel with a plastic bag, then stand on it.  The plastic bag prevents the liquid getting on your shoe/slipper and is right there to pick up the paper towel without soiling your hand.  If you wish to use newspaper to absorb, put paper towel on spot before newspaper to prevent ink getting on floor or carpet.  You can wipe tile or other hard floor surfaces (test a hidden area first) with the neutralizer just to be safe.

You have to make sure that you are commited to the pet and that it is not just a passing fancy, these rodents live longer than say a mouse or a rat, they can also make quit abit of noise. But listed below is a website that might be handy, before you get one, do your research!|`|AA10263406	No, my old roomate had 4.

Como ele costuma fazer a cada 73 mil anos, ele vai aparecer um pouco maior e mais brilhante do que o habitual.

Sua mxima aproxima??o  Terra vai ocorrer no dia 27 de agosto, quando o planeta estar a uma distancia de 55,8 milh?es de quil?metros da Terra. A ltima vez que tal aproxima??o ocorreu foi h 73.000 anos.  importante observar, especialmente, sabendo que nenhum ser humano jamais o viu t?o brilhante. Naquela poca n?o havia registro histrico. Por este motivo, esta aproxima??o constitui, para o observador interessado no cu, uma ocasi?o nica para apreciar o planeta a olho nu.    Na realidade, Marte  visvel a cada dois anos, sendo que as mximas aproxima??es ocorrem a cada 15 ou 17 anos. Assim, a prxima aproxima??o equivalente a atual vai ocorrer em 2018, quando o planeta estar a 57,7 milh?es de quil?metros.    Atualmente, ele est surgindo do lado do nascente, por volta das 20:00 horas e est alcan?ando o znite  o ponto mais alto no cu  por volta de uma hora da manh?. J  um belo espetculo. No final do ms de agosto, Marte surgir ao anoitecer, logo aps o p?r-do-Sol, e alcan?ar o znite por volta da meia-noite.

They have hair, not regular fur, and it gets tangled and matted if not kept brushed and groomed.  Some are also very hyper, theirs jumps up on you and used to attack your feet the second you step into the house.  They like attention, and don't like to be left home alone.  Overall, I'd say they are a nice dog, but I'm not much of a dog person anyway.  Any other questions?|`|AA10569228	Bichon Frise Breed Standard  Non-Sporting Group     General Appearance  The Bichon Frise is a small, sturdy, white powder puff of a dog whose merry temperament is evidenced by his plumed tail carried jauntily over the back and his dark-eyed inquisitive expression.    This is a breed that has no gross or incapacitating exaggerations and therefore there is no inherent reason for lack of balance or unsound movement.    Any deviation from the ideal described in the standard should be penalized to the extent of the deviation. Structural faults common to all breeds are as undesirable in the Bichon Frise as in any other breed, even though such faults may not be specifically mentioned in the standard.     Size, Proportion, Substance    Size Dogs and bitches 9? to 11? inches are to be given primary preference. Only where the comparative superiority of a specimen outside this range clearly justifies it should greater latitude be taken. In no case, however, should this latitude ever extend over 12 inches or under 9 inches. The minimum limits do not apply to puppies. Proportion--The body from the forward-most point of the chest to the point of rump is ? longer than the height at the withers. The body from the withers to lowest point of chest represents ? the distance from withers to ground. Substance--Compact and of medium bone throughout; neither coarse nor fine.     Head   Expression--Soft, dark-eyed, inquisitive, alert. Eyes are round, black or dark brown and are set in the skull to look directly forward. An overly large or bulging eye is a fault as is an almond shaped, obliquely set eye. Halos, the black or very dark brown skin surrounding the eyes, are necessary as they accentuate the eye and enhance expression. The eye rims themselves must be black. Broken pigment, or total absence of pigment on the eye rims produce a blank and staring expression, which is a definite fault. Eyes of any color other than black or dark brown are a very serious fault and must be severely penalized. Ears are drop and are covered with long flowing hair. When extended toward the nose, the leathers reach approximately halfway the length of the muzzle. They are set on slightly higher than eye level and rather forward on the skull, so that when the dog is alert they serve to frame the face. The skull is slightly rounded, allowing for a round and forward looking eye. The stop is slightly accentuated. Muzzle--A properly balanced head is three parts muzzle to five parts skull, measured from the nose to the stop and from the stop to the occiput. A line drawn between the outside corners of the eyes and to the nose will create a near equilateral triangle. There is a slight degree of chiseling under the eyes, but not so much as to result in a weak or snipey foreface. The lower jaw is strong. The nose is prominent and always black. Lips are black, fine, never drooping. Bite is scissors. A bite which is undershot or overshot should be severely penalized. A crooked or out of line tooth is permissible, however, missing teeth are to be severely faulted.     Neck, Topline and Body   The arched neck is long and carried proudly behind an erect head. It blends smoothly into the shoulders. The length of neck from occiput to withers is approximately 1/3 the distance from forechest to buttocks. The topline is level except for a slight, muscular arch over the loin. Body--The chest is well developed and wide enough to allow free and unrestricted movement of the front legs. The lowest point of the chest extends at least to the elbow. The rib cage is moderately sprung and extends back to a short and muscular loin. The forechest is well pronounced and protrudes slightly forward of the point of shoulder. The underline has a moderate tuck-up. Tail is well plumed, set on level with the topline and curved gracefully over the back so that the hair of the tail rests on the back. When the tail is extended toward the head it reaches at least halfway to the withers. A low tail set, a tail carried perpendicularly to the back, or a tail which droops behind is to be severely penalized. A corkscrew tail is a very serious fault.     Forequarters   Shoulders--The shoulder blade, upper arm and forearm are approximately equal in length. The shoulders are laid back to somewhat near a forty-five degree angle. The upper arm extends well back so the elbow is placed directly below the withers when viewed from the side. Legs are of medium bone; straight, with no bow or curve in the forearm or wrist. The elbows are held close to the body. The pasterns slope slightly from the vertical. The dewclaws may be removed. The feet are tight and round, resembling those of a cat and point directly forward, turning neither in nor out. Pads are black. Nails are kept short.     Hindquarters   The hindquarters are of medium bone, well angulated with muscular thighs and spaced moderately wide. The upper and lower thigh are nearly equal in length meeting at a well bent stifle joint. The leg from hock joint to foot pad is perpendicular to the ground. Dewclaws may be removed. Paws are tight and round with black pads.     Coat   The texture of the coat is of utmost importance. The undercoat is soft and dense, the outercoat of a coarser and curlier texture. The combination of the two gives a soft but substantial feel to the touch which is similar to plush or velvet and when patted springs back. When bathed and brushed, it stands off the body, creating an overall powder puff appearance. A wiry coat is not desirable. A limp, silky coat, a coat that lies down, or a lack of undercoat are very serious faults. Trimming--The coat is trimmed to reveal the natural outline of the body. It is rounded off from any direction and never cut so short as to create an overly trimmed or squared off appearance. The furnishings of the head, beard, moustache, ears and tail are left longer. The longer head h|`|7d90a3b4a28f2a07552e871d30e8ed53aa	I know that they are good dogs if you have allergies.  Very playful but they are high maintance.  Grooming is a must on a daily basis.

It is usually all white, but cream, gray or apricot hairs are permitted. It can be shown clipped like a poodle or long-haired with clippings only at the feet and muzzle. This breed should be trimmed for a rounded appearance. It has a moderate muzzle that is not pointed. Its stop is only slightly accentuated. It has a scissors bite with round dark intelligent eyes and hanging ears that are well covered with hair. The neck is long and the chest is well developed. Its tail is curved over its back.The Bichon is a most appealing little white dog that loves human company. It has an independent spirit, is intelligent, affectionate, bold and lively. This charming, gentle dog is not a yapper. It has a self-assured, happy temperament that is easy to live with. These bright little dogs are easy to train and just plain old love everyone. They need people to be happy. They are naturally sociable and are happiest when they are part of a family that takes them everywhere. This sociable trait also means that they are fine in the company of other dogs & pets and are excellent with children. Used as watchdogs and to perform tricks, this breed is competitive and obedient. Like a lot of smaller breeds, the Bichon may be difficult to housebreak. The Bichon Frise was one of the "Yuppie Puppies" very popular in the 1980's. As a result many were carelessly over-bred and some Bichon lines can be snippy. When seeking a Bichon be sure to find a reputable breeder to get the best personality traits this breed has to offer.  Height:  Dogs 9-12 inches (23-30cm.) Bitches 9-11 inches (23-28cm.)  Weight: 7-12 pounds (3-5kg.)  Some are prone to watery eyes, cataracts, skin and ear ailments, also epilepsy and dislocated kneecaps. They can be very sensitive to flea bites.   The Bichon Frise can live in an apartment if it gets enough exercise. They are fairly active indoors and will do okay without a yard.These are active little dogs and play will take care of most of their exercise needs, but they do love walks and especially to romp in the open.

We searched for that breed because they are basically hypoallergenic and do not shed.  They also are the cutest dogs I have ever seen.  They are often times mistaken for puppies even at this age.  Our children have asthma and allergies and these dogs cause no problems.  My only complaint is that we are having trouble with accidents.  Of course they are older dogs, but it is annoying none the less.  I would get another one in a heartbeat.  They are very cuddly and like a live stuffed animal.
AA12223664	You can't change it's personality just like that. Maybe you can by talking to it's vet.|`|AA11618088	German spitzes are known for barking at strangers and protecting the house.  Unless you broke her of it at a young age, it will be hard to break her of it - you will now be fighting nature.  You can try by telling her 'good girl' each time she warns you of something.  Then, ask her to stop and she may understand that you are pleased that she did her job and you are ok now.      They are family dogs, so if you are leaving her alone outside for longperiods of time - this is the most likely culprit.  You will have to adjust your lifestyle to watch her while she is outside and discipline her with vocal commands (firm 'no', not yelling, not creaming, not freaking out), a squirt bottle (say 'no' and squirt at the same time), and positive reinforcement (give her a treat when she avoids the area or comes to you when you tell her to stop).      You'll have to figure out why she is biting.  Is she fear biting?  Is she protecting you and the house?  Is she chewing on things?  Each one of these are different and require slightly different techniques to control it.  Fear biting will require that she be made to feel safe.  Protection will be gentle but firm correction and possibly a muzzle of some sort.  Chewing would require a vet visit and them behavioural adjustments.      I don't believe in zapping your dog for doing something that's natural and I don't believe in hitting (slapping/spanking/flicking) animals or using choke chains.  None of that is necessary if you use gentle reinforcement techniques.  I consider all that abusive and setting the stage for a larger problem.      If you bought her from a reputable breeder, try contacting them to see if they can offer recommendations.  They have probably been working with the breed for years and years and can offer you breed specific pointers.      Good luck to you!  : )|`|fc2bf0c5c18672809868c6f540007fb4aa	Obedience classes.

Try using Solid Gold Dog Food.  It is all natural and has stuff like long grain and brown rice instead of white. And it doesn't have all the stuff the FDA doesn't want us to eat. you can go to the web site and type in your problem and it tells you what to use.  It also lets you type in your zip and find a place that sells it. It isn't the cheapest, but it works so well.  It also reduces the stools they produce, because the body absorbs all the nutrients and gets rid of the bad stuff.|`|2044c80b753587e33e0a0e8b35f03b88aa	There are 3 common allergies in dogs. Food, contact, and inhalant. The least expensive way to find out if it's food is to put the dog on a strict hypo allergenic diet for 7 weeks. This means NOTHING else passes his lips. My personally favorite is IVD venison and potatoes. I had a dog that had the same problem. I put him on this food and within 2 weeks he was 100% better. If you can't find this food then try Hills z/d or z/d ultra. There are a few others out there. You have to buy it from a vet. There are some sold in stores that claim to be for allergies but they are not 100% hypo allergenic. If after this trial you still don't see any improvement then you will have to fork over the 3-500.00 for allergy testing. If you do this the company will develop an antigen to inject the dog with that will build up it's immunities to whatever it is allergic to.    Have you tried benadryl? 2 mg per pound given twice daily.    You can also try some oatmeal and aloe shampoo for temporary, immediate relief. If all of this fails then you will have to resort to steroids. This drug given on a regular basis can cause damage to the liver/and/or kidneys. Having said that you have to decide if you want to give your dog quality, or quantity of life. If you give the steroids in pill form (prednisone) you can give it every other day after the loading dose to give the organs a chance to recoup. If you give the injection it is in the body for close to 60 days. There is no taking it back. Unfortunately even with the pros.. it's a trial and error cure. If you don't try the things the vet suggests and give them feedback they won't know what helps, or doesn't help. There is no one cure all for every pet. Each pet has their own set of little quirks, and resistances. I hope this helps. Feel free to email me with further questions.|`|ee22f94356c1f6a05ce1d74b5f7b8017aa	Oh Boy!

Alice|`|f464a569517bd592a904db90e83e43c0aa	Allergies in dogs are one of the worst things I've experienced.  Changing your dog's food might help if it's a food allergy.  Find a natural diet that has an protein source that's unlike any of the regular protein sources, i.e. venison, fish, etc.  It may take a few months to see a difference, but it will be worth it.  Eliminating wheat, corn, and other products in the food will help, too.  The same thing with treats.  All ingredients in treats should be checked to make sure they are free of chicken, beef, corn, etc. the stuff you find in regular foods.  Fresh veggies are an excellent treat.  Check around on the foods.  Lamb is a good protein source for allergy dogs, but some companies trick you into thinking there's just lamb in there when upon reading the ingredients, you find other things like beef, liver or chicken.  I use Dick Van Patton's Natural Balance Venison on my dogs (available at Petco).  Get one without all the preservatives, colorings, etc.  It's helped my dog a lot.  Check on the internet for natural foods.  They may be a bit difficult to find, but most of the sites will give you dealers in your area where you can purchase the foods.    Now if it isn't a food allergy or only partially food allergies, this is a real pain.  Vets offer allergy testing, which involves a blood test.  It can only be done if your dog is off all cortisone for a number of weeks.  I tried waiting the alloted time, and my dog scratched his ear so hard, he ended up with a hematoma (swelling from trauma to the ear) and needed surgery.    My dog has a combination of food allergies and others.  What I've found to work the best with my dog is low doses of cortisone, monitored by my vet, given only occasionally.  It can cause major problems if given all the time.  I bathe him regularly with Relief Oatmeal shampoo and conditioner.  If he gets a skin infection, which is common with allergy dogs, he's put on antibiotics until the problem is gone.  Sometimes this may be for several weeks.  I add a fatty acid supplement to his diet.  Your vet can suggest the best one.  I use Heska F.A. granules which I sprinkle on his food twice a day.  There are also capules made by different companies that contain fish oil, if you'd rather give a pill.    I saw from your original post that Benadryl didn't help your dog.  Unfortunately, it didn't help mine either.  There are other antihistamines you can use.  Ask your vet about Chlorpheniramine, Tavist, or others.  DO NOT ever use them without asking your vet first.    What I've found in my experience is that there is no magic pill to get rid of all allergies.  Dogs can be allergic to anything from dust to weeds.  If you are not happy with your vet's answers, go to another vet, or have your vet refer you to a board certified veterinary deramtologist.  They're out there.  If you can get the allergy testing done, do so.  They may be able to pin point your dog's specific allergies.  You can give him shots to desensitize him to the things he's allergic to and give him some relief.    You can try a holistic vet, too.  They may suggest a food or a combination of more natural things to alleviate your dog's problem.    My dog is a black german shepherd.  Shepherds are notorius for allergy problems, but they can occur in all breeds.  Don't give up.  They can be happy and healthy without being medicated constantly.  It's frustrating to find the right combination of things that will work for your dog, but keep trying.  Good luck.

"O campo do amor  infinito em sua essncia e manifesta??o.     Existe o amor? Ou vivemos apenas paix?es que confundimos com um suposto e imaginrio sentimento de amar? S?o diferentes?  Do grego ns temos que existem trs maneiras de amar: a carncia (er?s) que abrasileiramos por eros mais ligado a idia do amor sensual; o regozijo (philia) que  a alegria pela boa nova anunciada pelo Cristo que nos torna capazes at mesmo de amar os nossos inimigos.  a alegria pela amizade e pelas possibilidades de amarmos a todos; a caridade (agap) que podemos entender como a forma mais completa do amor. E com tal respeito e verdade amarmos tanto e de tal modo que nem percebemos que o nosso semelhante sofre e por isso precisa receber a nossa ajuda. N?o podemos ajudar s os que sofrem, isto , a nossa evolu??o ainda vai nos levar ao dia em que tenhamos a caridade como manifesta??o espontanea e que n?o necessite de causa ou motivo para ser manifesta.     Enquanto estamos falando da idia de amor associado a manifesta??es da sexualidade, estamos falando das paix?es que, enganosamente, chamamos de amor. A paix?o, enquanto amor, n?o existe. E o amor enquanto o fogo da paix?o n?o pode ser chamado ou considerado como tal. No entanto, a sexualidade presta a um grande servi?o. Ela  um fogo que pode purificar os apaixonados e transformar os sentimentos, um dia, em amor. Difcil ser encontrar no amor ao outro, misturado com a volpia do sexo o amor que tanto se propaga. Provavelmente tais sentimentos n?o passam das frases que ouvimos a torto e a direito nas novelas. Eu te amo transformou-se numa frase de efeito, que teve validade apenas, para a cena mais emocionante do captulo da noite passada, ou que servir para depositarmos no personagem central do filme a nossa emotividade carente e que anseia por um imaginrio ou desejado amor de verdade. Isso acontece porque, no ntimo, todos ns almejamos, um dia, encontrar o amor.

AA11314442	First of all, I want to say I am very sorry.  I lost my 9 year old dog to cancer in November and it was single handedly the hardest thing I have ever to go through.      I'm not familiar with grade 2 Sarcoma; Roofus P.'s cancer was untreatable and therefore, fatal.  All I can share with you is my experience with him and hope that it may help you in any way.    He slowly became less active and I let him run the show.  I always gave him the opportunity to go play/hike/run and I knew that when he didn't want to do these things he would let me know and he did without question.    He began to stop eating.  I went through chicken, hot dogs, steak, salmon, cheese, everything you could imagine and he just would not eat toward the end.  My veterinarian put him on a newer anti-inflammatory medication which I cannot remember the name of but has a dog bounding through the air on the prescription package and is usually given to dogs with arthritis.    If you can and want to treat it, that is your decision.  My only advice to you is to make sure he/she gets everything they want, don't treat them like they are sick and don't bawl all over them.  The most upsetting thing about my dog being sick was that he stressed out over me being upset...he didn't understand.    If things take an unfortunate turn, I want you to think about this:  My dog was an old soul, you could see it in his eyes.  I found comfort in his passing because I knew he had done it before and was not afraid.  Also know that it is true when people that have gone through this say that your dog will let you know when it is time...I tormented myself for months over it.  The day he went, he looked me straight in the eyes and I knew.    I know this may be a little heavy but it's all I know and I am very sorry that you and your best friend have to endure this.    Best of Luck to the both of you.    -A|`|AA11853631	You vet is the best person to ask your questions.

If your dog has cancer, and there is no easyw ay to get rid of it. You should put him/her down. They get into so much pain, my dog was so bad she couldnt walk or eat, it was too late for surgery, and the cancer was gettign worse we had to put her down.  So my advise if the vet doesn't recomd surgery is to put hyim/her out of their misery. Its hard, and cruel i know, but its worse when you have to look at them every day and hear them cry :(

El American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) es un descendiente del Bulldog ingls original. Histricamente ha sido criado con la finalidad de perro de trabajo y de alto rendimiento. El APBT es un perro extremadamente atltico, verstil, adaptable, afectuoso, que gusta complacer, y un gran perro de familia. No tiene igual en el mundo canino en cuanto a coraje, resistencia, indiferencia al dolor, y perseverancia en resolver cualquier desafo. Alguna vez esta raza fue smbolo de coraje y orgullo, hoy da es una raza incomprendida.    A pesar que el APBT ha sido criado historicamente para sobresalir en combate con otros perros, un APBT bien criado tiene un temperamento extremadamente equilibrado, y contrario a la creencia popular, no es agresivo por naturaleza con los humanos. Sin embargo, al llegar a adultos, algunos pitbulls pueden mostrar agresin hacia otros perros. Este hecho, combinado con la fortaleza y determinacin del pitbull, debera ser tomado en cuenta al considerar si el American Pit Bull Terrier es la raza para ti. Como con cualquier perro de compa?a, la socializacin y el entrenamiento son vitales desde una edad temprana.    A pesar que algunos APBT podran desconfiar de los extra?os - como la mayora de los perros - y protegern sus seres amados de ser neceario, no suelen sobresalir en el trabajo de guardia y proteccin. Si tu motivo principal para tener un perro es el de guardia y proteccin, sera mejor que busques otras razas, tales como un Rottweiler, un Pastor Alemn, o un Doberman Pinscher, entre otras. O si realmente te gusta el fenotipo del bulldog, busca un American Bulldog.      --------------------------------------...    Socializacin    Por lo general los APBT tienen la tendencia de ser extremadamente amigables y confiados con la gente. Esto por lo general tambin es cierto, incluso con perros que no han sido debidamente socializados con personas. Igualmente, es preferible no asumir ningn riesgo y socializar al perro desde una edad temprana (tan pronto como se lo recibe).    Con los american pit bull terriers, un problema mucho ms comn que agresin hacia los humanos, es agresin hacia los perros. Si deseas llevar a tu APBT a parques y a otros lugares pblicos donde hayan otros perros, debes comenzar su socializacin muy temprano en la vida. La socializacin con otros perros es importante con todas las razas, pero es crucial para los APBT. No todos los pit bulls tienen inclinaciones agresivas hacia otros perros, pero muchos s. La socializacin temprana no es una garanta contra el eventual desarrollo de agresin hacia otros perros, pero combinado con un entrenamiento en obediencia bsica a menudo sirve como una estrategia efectiva para contrarrestar las tendencias agresivas de la raza y permitir que tu APBT goce de la compa?a de otros perros.      --------------------------------------...    Entrenamiento    Al igual que la socializacin, el adiestramiento bsico en obediencia tambin debera comenzar temprano en la vida del APBT. Es escencial tener completo control sobre el perro mediante la voz. Contrario a la creencia popular, el entrenamiento no va a "romper el espritu" de un APBT.    Otro mito peligroso sobre los APBT es que necesitan un tipo diferente de adiestramiento que otras razas: "La nica manera de hacer que estos perros te respeten es darles una buena paliza." La realidad es que los APBT tienen una gran tendencia a querer complacer y son emocionalmente sensibles, por lo que el tratarlos con rigor es contraproducente. A los APBT les encanta ser felicitados y abrazados, y es principalmente a travs de estos medios positivos que tu APBT aprender a anticipar lo que quieres, y l lo har con entusiasmo, tal como cualquier otra raza de perro.      --------------------------------------...    Ejercicios y actividades    Weight-pulling, un deporte creado para los Pit Bulls.    Una vez que tu perro ha sido correctamente socializado y entrenado, no existen lmites para las actividades que puedes disfrutar con tu perro. Los APBT son muy verstiles y son excelentes en agility, tracking, y frisbee. Habiendo sido criados para actividades prolongadas de alta intensidad, pueden correr durante horas y horas, por lo que son excelentes compa?eros de hiking o de mountain bike. Muchos tienen una fenomenal habilidad de salto. Otros hasta pueden trepar rboles. Existe un deporte especficamente dise?ado para APBT, las competencias de jalar peso (weight-pulling competitions).    Los APBT no slo disfrutan de mucha cantidad de ejercicio extenuante, ellos lo necesitan! Si no tienes tiempo para ejercitar a tu perro regularmente, debes elegir otra raza. No necesitas de gran espacio para darle a tu perro ejercicio suficiente: una opcin popular es hacerle correr 30-45 minutos diarios en una cinta para correr.     Asegrate de no extenuar a tu cachorro mientras an se est desarrollando. El uso serio de una cinta de correr debera comenzar slo luego de los 18 meses de edad.      --------------------------------------...    Salud    En trminos generales, los American Pit Bull Terrier son una raza robusta y muy saludable.

Ho messo da parte il mio ecoismo di volerlo tenere con me e l'ho portato dal veterinario. Se non avesse sofferto, pero', penso che non l'avrei fatto. Per gli animali e' sempre fonte di rassicurazione trovarsi in un luogo protetto e amato, qual' la casa, circondato dai propri odori e dalle persone che l'hanno sempre accudito.

E' un po' come se fosse il mio fratellino,  cresciuto con me, mi sta sempre vicino, sembra che capisca ogni mio stato d'animo pi di chiunque altro. Dovresti, a parer mio, sentire l'opinione di un veterinario, solo lui con esami specifici pu consigliarti la soluzione migliore per il tuo cucciolo. Magari si pu curare o comunque cercare di farlo stare meglio ed aspettare che la natura faccia il suo corso, oppure se sta soffrendo (anche se in silenzio) ti consiglio di farlo sopprimere, non  cattiveria semplicemente un ulteriore gesto d'affetto, sembra incredibile ma significa non farlo soffrire pi. Cerca di stargli vicino e non fargli capire ci che sta accadendo, legge nei tuoi occhi e nelle tue espressioni come non puoi immaginare. Ti sono vicino anche io.

De lo contrario podra enfermarse de MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease) que es mejor conocido en espa?ol como raquitismo.  Los huesos; recuerda que el caparazn es una estructura osea; se deforman debido a que se pierde densidad y precisamente se ablandan y se vuelven muy frgiles.

47f74349e402e8397f09c68edb23e07faa	Some small breeders sell females more than males, as the males tend to lift their legs in the house.  Honestly, pups should be priced on structure first.  Who is the best pup in the litter towards the breed standard.  Some breeders also price their dapples more than solids.  You should never breed dapple to dapple or even if you buy a double dapple from someone, you should never breed that back to a dapple.  You can end up with a lethal gene this way.

AA10327148	When a man is tested in the military, or for a commercial driving license, the chart tests for color blindness. If he is deemed color blind, it means he can't see the colors of red and green, but only sees them as shades of brown..that is the human condition known as color blind.  However, dogs do not differentiate between red and green, so by human standards, yes, they ARE color blind.    But, some people think that the term means that color blindness is seeing only in black and white...dogs DO see other than black and white and shades of gray..so, they do see color.  They see yellow, blue, and tans/browns very well, and some shades of purple..but they don't differentiate red from green.    So, do they see color? YES  Are they color blind by human terms? YES  Do they only see black and white? NO  Here is a color chart to show how dogs see compared to humans..All dogs have 2 cones, (color receptors) and will see color the same..However, short nosed dogs see thing better close up than long nosed breeds, who see things far away better..|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	LMAO!!!

Whiskers have nothing to do with a cats balance, thats the tail. Whiskers, like the first person said, helps them measure to see if they will fit into something.

Good luck to ya|`|a82ed61903b133143f82e23e4927c870aa	They could get into a fight.|`|88aa92ff90703001f19ce1b6231f4d16aa	i do not advise leaving the cat with the kitten alone for a while..the cat has already claimed its spots in the house i am sure, if a new kitten comes in the cat may decide to make its territory...a lot of times it will put the kitten into stress and the kittne could become ill.  introduce them while you are around so you can keep a close eye on them.  put on the them in a room for the day and the next day switch them..the scent of each of them will soon be in the whole house and they will sooner or later become friends!|`|a3bb41715691f9ee5cce252c05a32418aa	i think the best thing to do is either hold them in cages or bring them to a friends house to watch them until you get home|`|aa06c68c03a59d7b258886cd48edd71eaa	Hearing your 1 year old hissing and growling at your new kitten is normal.  She's telling both you and the kitten that she's upset about having to share your affections and her territory.  You don't need to play ref; your cat will teach the kitten who's boss and might include a few swipes at the kitten with closed paws.  Your cat is young and will adjust.     I wrote the above from personal experience.  Last year my ex-boyfriend brought home a female kitten to be company for our 8-year-old neutered cat -- he reacted the same way.  Most important is that despite his vocal discontentment he never harmed the kitten or the five kittens she went on to have.  Hope this helps calm your worry.  Best wishes.|`|AA11113749	You should not leave them alone unsupervised until you are certain there is no chance the older cat is going to harm the kitten.  Cats are very territorial, and it is possible that she could seriously hurt him.    Give them several months to get used to each other before you leave them unattended in the same room.|`|2a38183a5d7c8ee73fcf6c389c8d1655aa	Your cat could attack your kitty and do some serious damage to him. If she would bite him, you'd have a huge problem on your hands. Cat bites  are the worst because they become so easily infected. They carry alot of bacteria behind the long teeth they have in the front of their mouths. People have been hospitalized because of cat bites. Just think what it would do to your little kitten. It would have a chance. You don't want to leave them out together unless you're there. You have to be patient. It takes time. If you do leave them out, you could come home to a very nasty situation.|`|d5c09772ab7b850e186945bb0a81a9fdaa	I have had many new kittens introduced to cats.  Cats need to show who's boss, and I think that your cat will probably not kill the kitten, she might scratch him up a bit, but once dominance and territory is established, all should be good.  Cats are adaptable and can run and hide if they feel threatened.|`|c1a3f3a3cef2751ed64c88762381bd7eaa	The female could actually kill the kitten worst scenario.
6a9ad14604170b7a2c4a7d30429b634aaa	Yo tambin tengo una perrita French Poodle, tambin se les llama Caniches.    Me imagino que en estos momentos ha de parecer un perrito de peluche, se ha de ver hermoso. Felicidades por tu adquisicin.    Son perritos muy entendidos, muy nobles, muy dulces, muy obedientes.    Los cuidados que debe tener por ahora y los pricipales es que lo lleves al veterinario, para que lo desparasite y le ponga su primer vacuna. Tambin te dar un carnet, con las fechas de las prximas vacunas.  Es muy importante que se las coloques todas, es por el bien del animalito. Hay enfermedades como el Parvovirus, el Moquillo y la Hepatitis, que pueden matarlo, adems que son muy dolorosas.    No lo saques a la calle, hasta que tenga TODAS las vacunas. Aproximadamente tendr todas las vacunas por ahi de los 4 o 5 meses de edad.    Esos perritos tienen mucho pelo, as que desda ahorita acostumbralo al cepillado. Compra un cepillo especial y cepllalo diario o 3 veces por semana. Con cuidado y buscando que lo disfrute.  Si ves que ya le creci mucho el pelo, llvalo a una Esttica Canina, para que le hagan el "Corte de Cachorro".....por el momento no te recomiendo que le hagas otro corte, ya que con este corte, el pelito le quedar chiquito y tardar un poco ms en crecerle y ser ms sencillo su cuidado, sobretodo mientras est cachorrito. NO lo debes ba?ar seguido, por ahora, hasta que tenga todas las vacunas. Asi que de preferencia, si le hacen el corte, que lo ba?en en seco.    Para adiestrarlo, sobretodo para hacer sus necesidades, puedes hacer lo siguiente:........de preferencia colocale un lugar en tu casa, y limtala con algn corralito. Este corralito le servir de refugio, ah dormir, comer y har sus necesidades....NO utilices ese corralito como castigo. Ponle en toda el rea hojas de peridico, para que haga sus necesidades y se vaya acostumbrando a relacionar el olor del peridico, con hacer sus necesidades ahi...........Ya ms grandecito, puedes sacarlo del corralito para que conviva con ustedes.    Consiguele una camita para perros o bien colocale algunas sbanas que ya no uses y doblalas a manera de un colchoncito con ellas, para que duerma......su plato para la comida y su plato del agua, cuida de cambiarla diario el agua.....y algn juguete (te recomiendo los huesos de hilos, se entretienen mucho con ellos)    En cuanto a la comida, compra croquetas que sean para su edad y raza. Las croquetas Royal Canin tienen para todo tipo de razas y para todas las edades. Son un poco caritas, pero son excelentes y adems les gustan mucho.  Las croketas debes drselas siempre secas, NO les a?adas ni leche, ni caldo, ni agua.    Y lo ms importante. Mucho amor, mucha paciencia y vers que ser divino.

A los 2 meses, cambias a un antiparasitario para adulto, puede ser Drontal, el cual se lo debes dar cada 3 meses, de por vida.
