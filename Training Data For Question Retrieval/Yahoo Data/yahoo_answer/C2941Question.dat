From last years so many tigers shifted from Bandhavgarh to other national parks and also to Bhopal.   So why should not shift a pair of "White Tiger" in his birth place BANDHAVGARH to grow by natural way at his birth place.

20090305071908AAF1rKl	Environment;Green Living	What do you do to make recycling less of a hassle in your home?	Just curious.  I am trying to teach my 9 year old to take care of the earth because when I am dead and gone, her generation is going to be the one in charge of keeping it clean.  So we have a "recycling corner" where we put the recyclables and then at the end of the week we take the cans and put them in the "can can" and then take the cardboard and put that in the "cardboard can", etc.  We're lucky to have a regular recycle pick up in our neighborhood.      Also, part of her chores is to try and keep her showers under 10 minutes.  She takes them at night and used to spend 25-30 minutes with me standing in the door way saying "Giada, c'mon honey!" and now if she keeps it under 10 minutes (and still gets clean of course) then she gets a star and it goes towards her allowance at the end of the week.      What do you do to make recycling less of a hassle and more of a routine?
