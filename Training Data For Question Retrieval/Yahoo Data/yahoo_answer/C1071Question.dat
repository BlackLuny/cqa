They keep reassuring me that I have enough skill, though I've never played on a soccer team, and they've never seen me play.  I need to know about the game and what I might want to try out for too. Also, I play volleyball and I run cross country all the time, but I don't know if that would help.

20090225153204AASOKLA	Sports;Basketball	All of you who think Marbury will hurt the Celtics are WRONG .. seriously ..?	Why do you think Marbury would help the Celtics? Oh because of the problems he created when he was with the Knicks? Because he refused to play off the bench? He probably didn't want to play for losers anyway ... but there's more to it. Think about it.      He's an excellent point guard who can score and even grab an assist (Do me a favor, look at his career stats) ... don't bring his attitude issue into this. He's still AS AN NBA Player, a decent PG. Plus, he's a veteran who could serve as a mentor to Rondo.       I'm pretty suree won't act like he did with the Knicks cause he's playing with the team that won the finals last year. What's there to complain about? Please tell me. He knows he'll have to prove himself that he's still a decent PG who can score and distribute the bell, or he'll be done. I know Marbury is aware of that. So he probbaly won't hurt the Celtics, he'll just benefit with them with a new mindset and motivation.

If he played in all those games and if mcnabb would throw him the ball more he'll have the same numbers as desean probably even better. Everyone thinks desean is better and does not give kevin any credit. look at the nfc championship game Kevin had a great game and he does not even get credit for it. He made plays that desean wouldn't make. Desean dropped 2 great td passes in the Washington game. If it werent for the events that happened after that game the eagles wouldn't of made the playoffs. Kevin has better hands and is more reliable. All he needs is more opportunities.

He is rly good and gives you the best chance to win out of anyone else that you can realisticaly get to replace him.      Saints (or where he ends up) Deuce McAllister      Deuce is one of the classiest guys in the NFL. I hope that he has a season similar to Fred Taylor's two years ago.

First they made her divas champ  Then they made her change her finisher  She turned heel and now    WWE booking is trying to plan for upcoming women's match at WM 25 and they think Trish vs Michelle will be a good headline. WWE booking thinks that putting Michelle against Trish will help her win over the fans and help make her credible in the ring against a veteran diva.    Ever since winning the Divas Championship against Natayla back in GAB 2008 Michelle has not receive much love from the fans if anything her being champion contributed her lose of popularity.     WWE is desperate in helping to make Michelle become the dominate diva on SD which led to her turning her heel so she can keep her push on the SD.    Do you guys think there should be a match like this at WM 25 explain and do you think it will help because when Michelle went against Victoria two weeks ago her win did not help her credibility    Or should WWE focus on pushing the current divas on the roster and leave Trish's legacy alone. The fans know that the current divas today can never compare to the divas to attitude era so what do you guys think.

20090225153618AAdKWP7	Sports;Football (Soccer);UEFA Champions League	What has to be done to win in the 2nd leg?	I'm still new to international "football," so I need CL advancement procedures explained.  Based on 1st leg results, I've been told that Roma will have to beat Arsenal by at least 2 in Rome to advance, and that if they win by 1, it's 1-1 on aggregate and Arsenal wins.  Good for me, but I don't understand what the tiebreaker is.      Bayern Munich beat Sporting Lisbon 5-0 in Lisbon, so I'm guessing Bayern could put a U.S. collegiate team on the pitch in Munich and still advance.  That's simple enough.      Liverpool beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the Bernabeu.  Looks like RM is in deep trouble, which is fine with me.  How can they still win?      Chelsea beat Juventus 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.  What does Juve need to do in Turin to advance?      Manchester United and Internazionale Milan had a scoreless tie at Old Trafford.  Who needs to do what at the San Siro?      Atletico and Porto tied 1-1 in "the other Madrid game." Who needs to do what when they meet again in Portugal?      Lyon and Barcelona tied 1-1 in France.  Who needs to do what when they meet again at Camp Nou?      Villareal and Panathanaikos tied 1-1 in Spain.  When they meet again in Athens, what does each have to do to win?

20070311123129AAm1bmZ	Sports;Other - Sports	Alguém aí pode me ajudar com uma sugest?o para o uso adequado de uma bicicleta ergométrica?	Gostaria de entender como elaborar um programa para perda de peso utilizando minha bicicleta ergométrica...      Minha bicicleta possui regulagem de esfor?o (de 1 a 8), mas n?o sei como lidar com isso... é melhor pedalar com alta velocidade e por muito tempo, ou seria melhor colocar em um nível alto de esfor?o por um tempo mais curto??       Com a bicicleta no esfor?o "1", e chego a fazer 21 kil?metros em 1 hora. Isso é bom ou está muito fraco?      Obrigada a todos que responderem com seriedade.       Um abra?o.
