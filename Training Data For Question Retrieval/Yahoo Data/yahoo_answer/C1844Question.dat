20090223074139AA9MZIA	Computers & Internet;Software	Recent Microsoft update changed my IE window size.  How to fix?	We received an automatic update the other day that messed up our computer and we haven't been able to find a fix.  Even when the window size is expanded to fit our nice wide flatscreen monitor, the outer edges are white while the body of the window occupies only about the middle 3rd of the screen.  The font is really small also, and only tries to cram all the larger info into the smaller space when we enlarge the font.  The only exception is when you click on an ebay item, then the auction details spread to fill the entire screen with a normal size font.  What the heck?  Did this happen to anyone else?  How do I fix it?   Many thanks!

20090223074356AAeJHxe	Computers & Internet;Software	A good Malware remover that runs constantly?	Hey Everyone,      Lately i been having a lot of malware on my computer. I have done everything in my power to get rid of it but it doesn't seem to be doing the job. The problems started after i got service pack 3 for xp.      Currently i am using avast as my antivirus and then when my computer is not acting right i use asquare and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. I have use them constantly and its like every week i have to run it to get rid of the problem or else system restore. But now i am at the point where the link to my system restore is gone along with the link to display.       I am thinking i need a malware program that can run constantly to check for malware or else need a different malware remover. So i am wondering if anyone knows a safe malware remover (i am not the best at knowing which registry keys to keep or get rid of which is why i use the other two programs). An if its possible one that's free.      Thank you,   Rach

Only problem is, though it has all installed fine, to use it is asking me for a serial number. I have had this software for  few years now, and no longer have the box or manual or anything to find the serial number, I only have the disc D:      Does anyone know how I can recover my serial number, or does anyone know theirs that I can use so that the programs will run?      It would be so great if you could help me out.      Thanks! x

20090223084728AAJ4T9r	Computers & Internet;Software	Disable mobsync.exe on Vista sp1?	I'm having an immense amount of trouble getting rid of mobsync.exe on my vista machine. It has started appearing on start up a couple of weeks ago (I cannot think what I have installed that would cause this, I am generally pretty careful plus I (normally!) know what I am doing). There's no associated service in admin tools > services and nothing unusual in msconfig > startup. I deliberately keep services and start up apps to an absolute minimum for reasons of efficiency.    I’ve also tried removing mobsync.exe from the system32 folder although, despite being the administrator on this computer, I don’t have sufficient permissions to remove it. I have googled endlessly for a working answer but none of the three options that I found (outlined above) seem to work.  Any suggestions?

I would like to learn more about website directory structure best practices for large websites.  I have done some digging but have not found a very useful resource.  I would specifically like to find a resource that goes into depth -comparing folder names like html/img vs. html/assets vs. html/images.      I have found some people commenting that "its up to the developer" or "there are no guidelines" but surely there are best practices and proper ways to develop large sites that could have many folders and subdirectories.      More examples of my questions would be: Is it best to have a /main/  folder that contains /flash/ /css/ /forms/ etc. Or should each of those folders be its own subdirectory?   Thank you!

20090223091701AAqsYxd	Computers & Internet;Security	What to do about the registry?	I am a software developer.  In my work we make secure devices for bank transactions.  Some of these devices are USB.        The problem is with Windows.  Each time a device is plugged into the PC, its serial number is recorded in the registry.  Once about 500 devices have been plugged in and tested Windows will no longer see the devices.      Several shareware ‘registry cleaners’ exist.  Some will remove these entries and some will not.  Some will only remove the entries if the operator has administrator access.        Many of the utilities are not all that well written.  If more than about 50 or so of said entries exist, the commercial apps tend to crash.  Clearly some “buffer overrun” issue exists in their code.  Perhaps the authors never planned on there being quite so many entries.  Unfortunately I can not expect some operator in Malaysia, Brazil, or Mexico to run a commercial utility and walk through the menus every time they test 50 devices.  Also due to security reasons the IT department will not allow the operators to use computers with administrator access.      We have had an ongoing problem with third world labor with regards to unauthorized devices and our PC’s.  I can not help the fact that my employer insists on making this crap in the third world were the labor is cheap.  They must be saving almost 50 dollars a year, but that is another story.  Meanwhile I have to write code to make things ‘third-world’ proof as I can.      Most of my work is in Visual C++.  I can delete the entries under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, but this fails dismally if the operator does not have administrator access.  Any ideas?      If you have suggestions on how to stop them from plugging in unauthorised thumb drives and MP3 CD’s I would love to hear it.  We have been fighting this for some time.

It doesn't appear to be wireless, although, it does have the antenna with the waves coming off of it to indicate a wireless signal. My Network Connections doesn't indicate a way to connect to a wireless network.  What would be the next process to connect wirelessly? One of those USB adapter thingies? My school has wireless so NO ROUTER IS NEEDED.    My home has a working wireless network so I do not need a router there either.

It was a school laptop, so I didn't really have a choice in features or whatever but now I do.      Here's what I need:   1. It needs to be able to run Wonderland Online (2D mmorpg) without too much general lag   2. It needs to be able to hold at least 2,000 pictures without too much lagging   3. It needs to be able to hold at least a couple hundred songs without too much lag      I'm more concerned about the game and the images than the music. I'd also like it to be able to handle Picasa pretty easily. Also, is it the internet connection or the computer that determines whether or not Firefox runs nicely?      Price range is about $400 or less >.<

20090223095406AArqG2r	Computers & Internet;Software	MATLAB help graphing cell-array?	I am having trouble graphing data in matlab. I have measurements of altitude and wind speed+direction taken hourly over the last 8 years. I made a few calculations with the data such as wind shear and averages ect.. but what matters is that each hourly set of data must be a chunk of data. There are about 5500 chunks of data that I graph at a time. Each chunk of data has a different starting and stopping altitude and different numbers. So what is the best way of grouping and graphing the information? Currently I am using a cell array that is a 1x5500 double, with each of the 5500 points containing a matrix. But this way I must use a for statement from 1 to 5500, so it takes about 20 secs per graph and there are like 40 graphs a year for 8 years.. way too slow. How else could I graph the data? I tried putting all the numbers in one giant matrix, but this does not work because each chunk of data must be graphed to the corresponding altitude chunk, not one big continious graph. The first number is many chunks of data is zero, so it creates a mess going from the highest number to zero over and over. How should I graph this data! thanks

20090223094342AA2gRGl	Computers & Internet;Security	Could I have a worm on my laptop?	Plugged my pen drive into a school computer and a worm was detected. A computer-fixit guy came. He returned it and now it is worm-free. When I asked where it came from, he said probably a computer from home.      However, I don't remember plugging it into my laptop any time for the past few months, while i've been using it at school recently, but nothing was detected then by the school computers. All the school computers are linked together and run on the same network so if it had a worm before it should have detected it the first time.      Anywho, now I am worried that the worm may have come from my laptop despite the fact that I haven't put the pen drive into my laptop for the past few months. Is there a possibility that my laptop has a worm? I'm using Norton Antivirus and i've run a full system scan and it detects nothing.      Oh, and also, my left mouse button stopped working on my laptop a couple of weeks ago. Could that have been caused by a "worm" or something too?      Thanks in advance

20090223095659AAovsdk	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Youtube--what should I do?	So there was this video, and in the video description the user said something that offended me, and bothered me, and I voiced this opinion. I was met with hateful comments from the user, insulting me, saying awful things to me, calling me an idiot, making presumptions about my life, making fun of me, and getting others to gang up on me, and post similar comments. Not only that, but the person told me that this was his job, posting the videos and analyzing them, and that he is getting paid for it.      I don't really care about the things he said, I don't take them to heart, but I think that by posting those comments he was abusing his job, and abusing me for having a different opinion.   Is there anything I can do? Should I even do anything at all?

20090223101058AANnTUs	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	HDD failure....logic board or completely beyond repair?!?	Hi people,       My HDD in my laptop refused to spin up when i booted up my laptop.    When trying to run HDD test, it tells me no IDE is detected.   I've read that components can become stuck, usually due to a slight knock. However, coupled with the fact I can't recall it being knocked, the noises it is making do not sound like it is physically "stuck". The noises sound electrical....sort of like that sound your TV or radio makes when your mobile phone is recieving a call or text.       I have tried freezing the HDD, with no luck.    Is it worth replacing the logic board with one from the same hardrive and firmware?   Or does it sound as if something much more serious within the HDD is broken??      Thankyou very much!

20090223075516AAenDg9	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Can you allow "friends of SOME or friends of ONE friend" to view a photo album on Facebook?	In Facebook photo albums, it seems like you can only set permissions to an album for "Friends of Friends", "Friends ONLY", or even more restrictive (select friends, etc.).  However, I'm wondering if I could post an album, and allow all my friends to view it, as well as my wife's friends.  I don't want "Friends of Friends", because who knows who that may allow access to?  But if I just select "Friends Only", then people who have friended my wife but not me won't be able to see the album.      I don't really want to post the album on my page, then post the same album on my wife's page, because then any comments will be separate.  We tried the "Post this album on my page" link, but if the permissions are set to "Friends only", then it doesn't work.  It seems that there should be one more level of granularity.

Can anyone give me possible reasons I am getting the following error message when booting my computer up? It just started a few days ago.      IDE Channel 1 no 80 conductor cable installed   Floppy disk(s) fail (40)      I don't understand the IDE reference since both my hard drives and both my DVD/CD drives appear to be functioning normally.      But my 3.5" & 5.25" floppy drives have been acting strange. They sometimes won't read disks or even format them.      I have checked to make sure the cables are plugged in tightly and nothing else is loose, but I still get the error message.      Any ideas?

20090223103651AAjrXyh	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Windows XP 64 and IE 7 64 is a nightmare HELP?	I have just bought a new computer and was advised to install a 64 bit os so i bought a copy of xp Professional x64, it has taken me days to configure with massive amounts of program conflicts, I've had to install and uninstall all my software over and over in different orders to get them all to work, IE 7 keeps trying to download activex which i know it doesn't need. Microsoft say that x86 should solve these problems but it doesn't. Sometimes i get serious problems like the blue screen of death especially when i try to install google toolbar, AVG reports errors and wont work properly and the list goes on and on. I never had any problems like this with the 32 bit xp but i don't want to use this cos i've been told only 1GB of my RAM can be used meaning the other 3GB i paid for goes to waste. So what i'm trying to ask is, is the problem new technology the rest of the world has not caught up with, or is xp 64 rubbish? If anyone has had similar problems or has any suggestions on how to make this easier or even a solution i would be very happy

On two different pages, one with a logo sized at 70%, another at 100%, the same thing happens.      Tables, which are set at 70%, are right to the edge of the page when displaying in IE, while in FireFox, they show at 70%, as they should.      Some other stuff is also messed up, supposed to be to the right and isn't, other images and text supposed to be centered, but isn't.      Is there a   tag or some other trick that could be used to avoid this?      Why is IE messing with the horizontal width, as well as horizontal alignment??      THanks!!!!

20090223104232AAE73oD	Computers & Internet;Software	How do I turn OFF the autoformatting that keeps changing my whole document when I bold or center or underline?	I have a 50 page doc and when I go to underline or change the font of a word or center a heading or whatever the case may be, Word changes everything to that format all the way up and down the doc. I hit ctrl Z to undu this, but if you happen to forget and roll on with your work or hit ctrl Z once too many, your whole doc is screwed up and you have to change it all again..      Please help me get this solved. I have been into the word options and changed everything that I think needs it, but it seems I've just made it worse.

20090223111220AAIkoax	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Cookies or sessions for PHP login?	I'm a 'generalist'; namely, I'm THE IT guy at a midsize company.  I'm just dabbling a bit in web design for knowledge for now but would like to actually put it to use in production at some point soon.      I'm playing with setting up log-in and security capabilities in a  LAMP environment (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and I've completed a couple of web-based tutorials -- basic stuff -- create a little user table, create a registration page which encrypts the password, make a login page, make a page with secured stuff on it, etc, make a log out page...      ..so far the examples I have been working with are using cookies.  The login page creates a cookie with the username and (encrypted) password and then every subsequent page checks the cookie against the database...but this seems like it would be very cumbersome in production.  Also, it doesn't seem like a particularly good idea to store a user's credentials on their machine, even if it is encrypted.      If I do use this stuff in production, the nature of my company's business requires that security is the overarching concern.  Convenience and "Hi, Bob!" stuff is really not important.  I'm fine with the user needing to log in again if he/she leaves the thing idle for more than a few minute and/or closes the browser.      Again, I'm a PHP / MySQL semi-newbie, but would sessions make more sense for this?  Probably a mix of the two?      Any help or references to 'best practices' for this, and/or tutorials with examples?
