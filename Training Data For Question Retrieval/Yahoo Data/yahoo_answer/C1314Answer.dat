They have preferred temperature ranges, and they have enzymes in their bodies with performance optima at these temperatures.  Also, there is more oxygen present in cold water (and fish need oxygen to live).

Solids (ice) have the least, liquids have more, gases the most.|`|Gmvldblraa	The answer is meant to be steam, since particles  ( we are assuming molecules here) in that state will have the greatest kinetic energy - they are moving faster than molecules in any of the other states.  We are assuming that the particles all have the same mass - that they are identical particles.    But if the particles all actually did have the same mass, then it would follow that they all have the same energy.  Fact is, molecules of water moving fast ( ie -steam) are more massive than molecules of water vibrating in place (ice). There is no way they can actually have the same mass as each other.  Yeah - I get carried away.

So if the avgs were as follows:  HW = 95, MT = 76, F=??, P = 88  you can substitute in to see what you need to make on the final to get an A (90) or B (80) by this:    (95)(0.5) + (76)(0.1) + (F)(0.1) + (88)(0.3) = 90   calculating  81.5 + (F)(0.1) = 90  F=(90-81.5)/(0.1) = 85    so the minimum score on the final for an A is 85.

962d4f3dfa9b1dd02c9f69b86c964cedaa	The energy required to break molecules apart is much smaller than a typical bond-energy, but intermolecular forces play important roles in determining the properties of a substances.   The boiling point of a compound is the temperature at which a compound turns from a liquid to a gas or a gas to a liquid. This temperature is a true measure of the forces of attractions between molecules as molecules separate from one another when they turn from a liquid to a gas.   Water normal Boiling Point :99.97 oC  Methanol Boiling Point : 64.7 oC  The average bond-energy for O-H bonds in water is 463 kJ/mol.  The energy required to break the O-H bond in methanol (CH3OH) is 437 kJ/mol4    Water has the stronger type of IMF compared to Methanol.  The liquid B evaporated first  so it is methanol.

So both sides are 72. What you also see here is that it is a right triangle so therefore we can apply the pythagorean theorem which is (a^2) + (b^2) = (c^2). I this case we are looking for the hypotnuse, which is represented by the letter a in the picture. So here we go:  (c^2) + (b^2) = (a^2)    [i just switched the a and the c so that the a is in the correct place now and so that you don't get confused]  72^2 + 72^2 = a^2  5184 + 5184 = a^2  10368 = a^2      [now we will square root both sides to get rid of the ^2]  sqrt(10368) = sqrt(a^2)  101.82 = a    So a is 101.82 units long. If you want the exact answer it is the square root of 10368. Hope that helped. ^_^

VERY IMPORTANT:  As this drug is metabolized primarily in the liver, it is important to be compliant with routine blood tests to check for any abnormalities in liver function (a normal test reassures the doctor that the drug is not having toxic effects on the liver).<br>  As far as side effects, everyone is different but here are some frequent side effects experienced:  abdominal pain, irregular menses, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, weight change and tremors.  Some side effects that are less frequently experienced include:  constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, skin rash, unusual excitement and restlessness.  Some adverse reactions include:  liver toxicity (esp in the first 6 months), loss of seizure control (if epileptic), malaise, weakness, lethargy, anorexia.<br>  If you are experiencing any symptoms that may be a side effect from the drug, notify your doctor at once to be sure it is not an adverse or allergic reaction to the drug.<br>  Additionally, you should watch alcohol intake while on this drug as alcohol will increase the central nervous system depressant effects.  Also, do not take any over the counter drugs or supplements (such as herbs or vitamins) without consulting your pharmacist to verify that they will not adversely interact with each other.|`|AA11251333	I am a pharmacy technician and the answer is I have seen  people have these symptoms:<br>  <br>  Common or Dose-Related Side Effects: <br>  <br>  Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, anorexia, weight loss or weight gain, sedation, unsteady gait, tremor, hair loss, photosensitivity, and irregular menses may occur.<br>  <br>  Gastro intestinal irritation can be reduced by taking the medication with food. If other side effects such as tremor, weight gain etc., become bothersome, notify your doctor because the dose may need to be decreased. <br>  <br>  If this occurs, your doctor may: <br>  <br>  1.) spread out the dose evenly throughout the day in four divided doses<br>  2.) decrease the daily dose and increase the bedtime dose<br>  3.) instruct you to take your pills with food since this will slow the rate at which the medicine gets into the blood, but will not affect the total amount that is absorbed. <br>  <br>  Serious Side Effects:<br>  <br>  Depakote may cause liver failure. Usually it occurs in children younger than 2 years old and in elderly patients and commonly in the first 6 months of the treatment. Symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, loss of appetite, swelling of the face, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin), rash, and itching. If these symptoms occur, contact your doctor immediately. <br>  <br>  Depakote can reduce the body’s ability to manufacture certain blood cells which are important to fight infections and prevent bleeding. A reduction in these cells can cause fever, sore throat and ulcers in the mouth, or unusual bleeding and easy bruising. If these symptoms occur, contact your doctor immediately. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Skin Rash: <br>  <br>  Skin rash can occur. Because rash can indicate a more serious medical condition, contact your doctor immediately if you develop a rash, fever, or swollen glands. <br>  <br>  Pregnancy: <br>  <br>  Women of child-bearing age should be aware that there is a small increase in risk for congenital malformations (fetal damage about 4-6% risk overall and a 1-2% risk of spina bifida), bleeding tendency in newborns and liver failure. This risk increases in women taking more than one anti-epileptic drug. Discuss this with your doctor.

There are other antibiotics that the doctor could prescribe.<br>  <br>  Many times antibiotics make you feel ickky because, in addition to killing the bad bacteria in your body, they also kill off the good backteria in your large intestines (E. coli) that are necessary for proper digestion.  I good way to prevent this nausea reaction and accompanying diahhrea is to eat yogart which contains active bacteria (bet you didn't know that!).  This makes the medicine go down better, too, if you get a flavored yogart that you like.

Second of all taking just part of or just one pill of an antibiotic prescription will not clear up the infection and can actually lead to the bacteria causing a superinfection or the infection to become drug resistant. (which is why antibiotic prescriptions always say take until all pills are finished...)

There have been studies that prove that people who have symmetrical faces are more attractive that those who have little symmetry but ones that are too symmetrical are non-attractive. In the test they used photos one of a symmetrical face and one unsymmetrical. The participants always chose the photo of the symmetrical face as being the more attractive. Cool huh?

I'm thinking it's not very common to have a symmetrical face.  At least not a perfectly symmetrical one.  I don't know why though
51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Simply stated:<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that batteries do not produce electricity, they store electricity in the form of chemical energy (H2SO4 or sulfuric acid) This electrolyte is the only physical connection between the positive and negative terminals. A battery's state of charge can be tested by merely checking the electrolyte acid and water mixture and comparing it to plain water - this is called the specific gravity of the electrolyte.<br>  <br>  As the battery discharges, both electrodes inside the battery undergo a chemical change to form lead sulphate on the plates as the battery discharges. Recharging the battery simply reverses this process and partially renews the chemical electrolyte.<br>  Eventually the plates become more and more sulphated until the ability of the chemical change which releases the energy becomes poor enough as to render the battery "used up."|`|0bb3752ef2d29c29ce2dac726d49f14baa	Essentially, a battery is a "voltaic cell", which probably means very little to you, so let me explain.<br>  <br>  A redox (reduction/oxidation) chemical reaction, which is a reaction where electrons are transferred, is the primary "driving force" of a battery. Essentially, once this chemical reaction reaches equilibrium, there are no more electrons flowing through the circuit, and the battery "dies".<br>  <br>  Rechargeable batteries simply add energy to reverse the reaction direction, and allow the battery to resume its normal operation.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Romi @ University of Waterloo

So we might consider every day as summer.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, since the earth's orbit is not a perfect circle but is an ellipse, with the sun at one focus, it means that for part of our orbit we are closer to the sun than at other times.<br>  So our "seasons" would simply be a result of how far from the sun we were in the orbit - days would be hottest when we're closest to the sun in late January and coolest when we were farthest from the sun in late July. <br>  But the temperature differences would be less than what we have now with our axial-tilt seasons.|`|JLjetsCBaa	The Earth spins on its axis at an angle as it orbits the sun.

AA11508270	When you want to find the period of the sum of sinusoidal functions, you need to first obtain the period of the individual functions.  In this case, the period of sin(3t) is: 3t = 2, t = 2/3    The period of cos(5t) is: 5t = 2, t = 2/5    Now, you need to find the multiples of the two periods, i.e.:    2n/3, 2n/5, n = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,....    After that, you will be looking for the least common multiple of the fundamental period:    2n/3: 4/3, 6/3, 8/3, 10/3, 12i/3, 14i/3, 16/3, 18/3    2/5, 4/5, 8/5, 10/5, 12/5, 14/5, 16/5, 18/5, 20/5, 22/5    I didn't simplify the multiples, but you should see that the least common multiple of 2/3 and 2/5 is : (6/3) = (10/5) = 2    Hence the period of: sin(3t) + cos(5t) is : 2    This same procedure would be performed if you were asked to find the period of 15, 20. 56, .... or whatever amount of functions:  You would need to find the least common multiple of all the individual period.|`|oVz6sPsIaa	For both sine or cosine the functions go through one period when the argument goes through 2pi.  Thus a function like sin(3t) hast period 2pi/3 and the function cos(5t) has period 2pi/5.

It's obvious that there are an infinite number of possibilities that would make the equation true, which we calll "ordered pair solutions." In this case, (1, -1) and (-3.45, 3.45) are two of these solutions.<br>  <br>  In an equation such as the one you are asking about, each of the two variables is raised to a power of 1, so this is a linear equation, and the "solution" to a linear equation with two variables is to graph the line on the coordinate plane.  The points on the line are all the ordered pair solutions to the equation.<br>  <br>  There are many ways to graph the equation of a line: you can substitute any value for one variable, and then find the corresponding value of the other, giving you an ordered pair solution for the equation.  Do that again, and connect the dots. (hint: if you set x=0 and find y, then set y=0 and find x, you have the x and y intercepts for the line) You can also change the equation into slope intercept form:<br>  3x - 2y - 6 = 0<br>  3x - 2y      = 6<br>  -2y            = - 3x + 6<br>  y               = 1.5x - 3<br>  which gives you all the information you need to graph the line.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can also graph it on a calculator!|`|9e7483b8ceb072c082c9b2ffc8b4145daa	No solution|`|dfa601af21f285d460f2e559fe049c4faa	solve for y... y=-3/2 x +3<br>  <br>  if this is agraphing problem y=mx+b<br>  slope is m, y-intercept is b<br>  <br>  to solve for the variables you need more information|`|eab57ea89b65ef050de3de430c2711d0aa	the equation is in the form of ax+by=c   You have it already equal to zero, that's good.

Provided that it is under 10 pCi/L, testing protocol says you should do another short term test to make sure the initial test was accurate.  A 90 day Alpha Tract (AT) kit is one option for a short term test.   If you were under 4.0 pCi/L, you wouldn't need a second test because you are under the EPAs recommended radon concentration for action.<br>  <br>  Because your initial test had a concentration of 5.0 pCi/L you should have another test.  If you do another 4 day test, keep all windows and doors closed during testing except for routine use.

AA12100452	The endocrine system is a control system of ductless glands that secrete chemical "instant messengers" called hormones that circulate within the body via the bloodstream to affect distant cells within specific organs. Endocrine glands secrete their products immediately into the blood or interstitial fluid, without storage of the chemical. Hormones act as "messengers," and are carried by the bloodstream to different cells in the body, which interpret these messages and act on them. Typical endocrine glands are pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands, but not exocrine glands such as salivary glands, sweat glands and glands within the gastrointestinal tract.<br>  <br>  The field of medicine that deals with disorders of endocrine glands is endocrinology, a branch of the wider field of internal medicine.<br>  <br>  In males only<br>  <br>      * Testes<br>            o Androgens (chiefly testosterone)<br>  <br>  In females only<br>  <br>      * Ovarian follicle<br>            o Estrogens (mainly estradiol)<br>  <br>      * Corpus luteum<br>            o Progesterone<br>            o Estrogens (mainly estradiol)<br>  <br>      * Placenta (when pregnant)<br>            o Progesterone<br>            o Estrogens (mainly estriol)<br>            o Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)<br>            o Human placental lactogen (HPL)|`|13300fd67512c34cb8f9670d59521b40aa	The glands of the endocrine system are "ductless" i.e., they release their secretions directly into the blood stream and control body processes and homeostasis via hormones.<br>  <br>  Contrast these with the 'ducted glands' which are the producers of enzymes, lubricants and so forth.

f057b977b7d185a50420795636b80beaaa	Wellbutrin (a/k/a bupropion, Zyban) is an antidepressant whose mechanism of action is not well understood though basically it affects chenical transmitters in the brain called neurotransmitters.<br>  <br>  "The neurotransmitters that are released by nerves are taken up again by the nerves that release them for reuse. (This is referred to as reuptake.) Many experts believe that depression is caused by an imbalance among the amounts of neurotransmitters that are released. Bupropion is unrelated to other antidepressants. It works by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, an action which results in more dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine to transmit messages to other nerves. Bupropion is unique in that its major effect is on dopamine, an effect which is not shared by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, Paxil; fluoxetine, Prozac; sertraline, Zoloft) or the tricyclic antidepressants or TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline, Elavil; imipramine, Tofranil; desipramine, Norpramin)." [Medicinenet.com]<br>  <br>  It's mechamism to aid in smoking cessation is even less well understood. Various hypotheses abound. For example, see<br>  <a href="http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-December/002577.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996...</a> for a proposed connection to melatonin levels.<br>  <br>  Physically, nicotine  causes the release of neurotransmitters, for example, serotonin and GABA. Serotonin helps regulate mood, sleep, sexuality and appetite and can indirectly cause dopamine release. Since Wellbutrin can affect dopamine levels, that may be its biochemical mechnism. <br>  <br>  Since Wellbutrin can reduce irritability and sadness as well as elevate mode through enhanced neurotransmission, it may also simply help the smoker deal psychologically with nicotine withdrawal. <br>  <br>  <br>  For technical papers see the following references:<br>    Durcan MJ, Deener G, White J, Johnston JA, Gonzales D, et al. 2002.

PYM3enDRaa	One such gene which is of great interest to humans is the ABO blood group gene. This particular gene has three alleles, rather than two. Of course, each of us has only two sets of chromosomes, so any one individual has only two of these alleles at once. But the presence of three different alleles means that there are six possible genotypes, rather than the three possible for the more familiar two-allele situation.<br>  <br>  For the ABO gene, the three alleles are the IA, IB and Ii alleles. We typically call these alleles "A," "B," and "O," but of course our rules for assigning symbols to alleles demand that all three be represented by some version of the same symbol. In this case, that common symbol is the letter "I," which stands for "immunoglobin."<br>  <br>  By now, the concept of dominance should be familiar to you. Of course, things get a bit more complicated when there are three alleles instead of just two, but basically the rules are the same. As the symbols above should suggest, the Ii allele (the "O" allele) is recessive to both the IA and IB alleles (the "A" and "B" alleles). The IA and IB show co-dominance. This means that in an individual who is heterozygous for these two alleles, the phenotypes of both alleles are completely expressed, thus producing blood type AB. AO would be type A since the O is recesive and BO would be B for the same reason.  Only OO produces blood of O the O type.|`|dac5cf9383fe4c25b7bb22162051f89daa	A trait cannot have more than two alleles. a chromosome only carries 2.  lets say you have and alleles for eye color as the letter c.<br>  <br>  the only alleles possible are a big C or little c. C being dominant and c being ressesive.

oLcLXm2Oaa	Stub Acme thread is generally used in place of a standard acme thread where there are restrictions in the wall thickness available.  Or it is used where a course thread is required, easy to start with minimum risk of cross threading or turning over a thread.  There is no obvious benefit in rounding off the root, it cuts further into a possibly thin wall section, provides an area for debris to accumulate and weakens the thread by increasing the pitch height.  I assume you are rounding the root but not the crest, if you did that it is no longer stub acme and you might as well select another standard thread form.

iN91UZvdaa	Evolution is key to everything that makes us what we are and what we could become. Some people consider our evolution is developed through natural selection with moments of mutation which can change the way life evolves thus taking different directions. Others believe that the reason we evolve a certain way is not due to nature but due to our bodies adapting to the environment. All life evolves to adapt that is fact, so salamanders are no different. Snake used to have limbs but when they started living underground they adapted to work without limbs and became more flexible and able to hunt more efficiently.     Evolution is all about mutation caused by our bodies adapting to environmental changes. It is widely believed that if we humans were to live on the oceans we would naturally evolve to become better swimmers and possibly mutate more efficient ways of doing so.|`|xXOnjDNOaa	In the environment in which they were living having developed limbs did not confer an especially large advantage toward survival, however they were a part of the body that must be maintained.  Given that there was so little advantage to having limbs, those salamanders who spent less energy supporting limbs would be more efficient, and therefore favored evolutionarily. This would have caused a reduction in limb size until eventually they were "limbless" salamanders.

ICymCdqsaa	Let x = number of minutes until 6 o'clock    3:00 + 4(x) + 50 = 6:00 - x    3:00 + 50 mins = 3:50, so:    3:50 + 4x = 6:00 - x    Add x to both sides:    3:50 + 5x = 6:00    From 3:50 to 6:00 is 130 minutes total, so divide:    130/5x = 26 minutes    So, it's now 26 minutes to 6:00, or 5:34.

The argument of "0 raised to anything is 0" is no more valid here than saying "anything raised to 0 is equal to 1".  Both are incorrect when you're dealing with zero to the zero power.    Like 0/0, the expression "0^0" is a special case in mathematics called "indetermined" or "indeterminate form".  It has no actual value because in theory it can take on any value.    If we assumed 0/0 had some value, then let it equal x.  That means 0/0 = x, which means 0 = 0*x.  But ANY value of x times 0 gives you back 0, so this equation has an infinite amount of solutions.  So we say that 0/0 is "indeterminate".    Likewise, if you remember that a^b / a^c = a^(b-c), then 0^0 can be rewritten as, say, 0^3 / 0^3.  But this is just 0/0, which as we showed is indeterminate.  So 0^0 is indeterminate too.    Note that this is not the same thing as "undefined".  Something like 5/0 is undefined because it CAN'T take on any values.  Again, if 5/0 = x, then that means 5 = 0*x, but there is no x such that multiplying it by 0 gives you back 5, because anything times 0 is 0.|`|3efGh30baa	unanswerable|`|I4K1Tjlbaa	0|`|RmcgrPMOaa	no solution

All meals are cooked for you and evenings are spent round camp fires under a starry sky.<br>  Itinerary<br>  Day 1 Arrive in Tripoli and transfer to a three star hotel.<br>  Day 2 After breakfast we drive along the coast to Leptis Magna, arguably the best preserved Roman town on the Mediterranean. After lunch we visit the museum at Leptis before returning to Tripoli and then flying Sebha, the capital of the Fezzan. Camp.<br>  Day 3 to 7 From now on we camp in the wild desert, away from other people. On the way to Waw al-Namus we will pass through Zueila, famous for the seven graves, As-Sabaha, of followers of Mohammed who died here in battle. Waw al-Namus is a volcano with several stunning crater lakes to see and swim in. The volcano also offers a pleasant walk. We will reach here in time for the eclipse, and if past weather is anything to go by - it should be fine!<br>  On our return journey we will use adifferent route to return to Sebha and fly back to our hotel in Tripoli.<br>  Day 8 Visit Tripoli museum then wander through the labyrinth of streets in the old town (medina).

pvYy6iTSaa	polo guru - the indigenous tribal peoples who inhabit the   rainforests are often regarded as obstacles to 'development'. This sentiment is reflected in a Brazilian official's statement that, "Not until all Amazonas is colonized by real Brazilians, not Indians, can we truly say we own it." For countless generations indigenous peoples have lived in the forests of the Amazon engaged in a complex and sustainable relationship with the land involving hunting, gathering, and   subsistence farming. They have developed technologies and   resource-use systems, such as agroforestry, which are just now being suggested as models for efficient rainforest management.     The greatest threat to the Amazon's tribal people, most of whom live in the rainforest, involves the conflicts that inevitably result when their territory is invaded by ranchers, miners, land speculators, and oil companies.     There is somewhere over one million indigenous people living in the Amazon today. Based upon accounts of continuous tribal settlements along the Amazon river by the first European explorers, anthropologists have estimated there may have been as many as six to eight million indigenous people in the Amazon 500 years ago. Of the estimated 900 indigenous groups that are thought to have inhabited this region in 1500, approximately 180 survive today.     Indigenous people have organized regional and national Indian organizations to press for their rights. Among their priorities are recognition of territorial reserves, economic self-development on a community level, and bilingual education programs to sustain their culture.     It is estimated that as many as one million people throughout the Amazon still earn a living by extracting renewable forest   resources including medicinal plants, dyes, palm fibers, and plant oils. Many of these people have lived deep in the forest, and have been subject to coercion and debt slavery by unscrupulous merchants and their hired gunmen. Now, they are organizing to create cooperatives to market products, and have succeeded in promoting the first 'extractive reserves' where they manage their traditional forest areas.

RzDAf5H4aa	Eye color is a matter of genetic dominance. Brown is the dominant color and blue is the recessive. The other colors such as grey, green, etc. are caused by "bars" in the genetic expression. <br>  <br>  Genetically speaking Brown is expressed as BB, or Bb, blue is the result of bb only - what this means is that two blue eyed (light eyed) people cannot have anything other than a light eyed child because they are both passing on recessive genes only. Whereas two dark eyed (brown eyed) people can have a dark eyed or light eyed child. You can research Punnet squares for a more detailed answer.<br>  <br>  Eye color really does not mean anything in today's time, it is simply an expression of a combination of genes.

For example, before genetic testing, a father might have wondered if a child was his.  If he was blue eyed, he may prefer a blue eyed female, because the resulting offspring would have to be blue eyed as well.  Should the child have brown eyes, he would know he wasn't the father.

GgX1iEJDaa	The way to evaluate absolute value bars is to break them into intervals: one where the contents are positive and another where it is negative. Solve for these intervals and (if necessary), split your integral into two separate integrals over these different intervals.    Find when it is positive:  ( 4x + 5 ) - x  0  ( 4x + 5 )  x  4x + 5  x2  0  x2 - 4x - 5   0  ( x - 5 )( x + 1 )     The x2 is positive, so it is an upward opening parabola.  The solutions are x = -1, 5  So between that interval, the original function is is positive. That means that it is negative from 5 to 9, and the absolute value bars thus act like a negative sign outside parenthesis for that interval.    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    9   |( 4x + 5 ) - x | dx  0    . .5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9  =  (( 4x + 5 ) - x ) dx +  -( ( 4x + 5 ) - x ) dx  . .0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5    Since these are the same besides a constant, just find the antiderivative of one and then use it for both of them.

j81AASLZaa	15.To calculate Molarity (stands for moles of solute/Liters of solution), convert the grams into moles (using the molar mass of the compound given...CaCl2 = Ca+Cl+Cl g/mol...use it as a conversion factor).

Remember if the problem gives you a volume in mL, covert to L by dividing by 1000.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	Since the average area of a spherical triangle (on the smaller area side of it) is  r2 / 2, and the total area is  4  r2, the odds that the 4th point is going to hit within this area is 1/8, which is necessary to form the vertices of a tetrahedron that encloses the center.  In other words, 1/8 is the probability, which seems pretty small, but there it is.    Now I'll wait for lots of thumbs down and some answers.    Edit:  I just happen to know that the average area is  r2 / 2, I don't have proof of it.|`|5UhcDtDAaa	Scythian is correct it's 1/8.    Having placed 3 points ABC, the 4th D will enclose the center in the tetrahedron if it lies in the spherical triangle A'B'C', where P' is directly opposite to P (so that the center lies on PP'). The probability of this is the area of ABC divided by the area of the sphere. So taking the area of the sphere as 1, we want to find the expected area of ABC. But the 8 triangles ABC, A'BC, AB'C, ABC', A'B'C, AB'C', A'BC', A'B'C' are all equally likely and between them partition the surface of the sphere. So the expected area of ABC, and hence the required probability, is just 1/8.

Hail is formed when the updraft keeps condensation nuclei suspended in a cloud (often a thunderstorm) until the ice aggregates to a point where the updraft is not longer able to support the crystals.  This is why you do not hear about hail falling from thin clouds such as stratus... you need the intense vertical motion to grow the hail.

c4KcwDZZaa	Sea-Monkeys are a trademark given to sell a variant of brine shrimp or Artemia salina, now called Artemia salina x nyos that originate in salt lakes and evaporation flats and are members of the phylum Arthropoda. In the UK in the 1970s they were marketed under the name "Artful Arties".    Sea-Monkeys are a breed of Artemia salina sometimes classified as a "new species" called "Artemia nyos" ("nyos" being an acronym for "New York Ocean Science Laboratories" where the first "Sea Monkey" Artemia were bred). This is in absence of a formal description fulfulling the ICZN requirements. As such, the correct name would be Artemia salina  nyos if Sea Monkeys are (as is sometimes reported) interspecific hybrids between A. salina and an indeterminate species of Artemia.    Sea Monkeys were first marketed in 1957 by Harold von Braunhut as Instant Life, though Braunhut changed the name to "Sea-Monkeys" on May 10, 1962. The name "Sea-Monkeys" was chosen because of their playful behaviour. Braunhut is also the inventor of X-Ray glasses. For many years, they were known for their exaggerated advertisements and packaging, which featured smiling anthropomorphic creatures who bore little resemblance to their true appearance. Underneath these pictures, which appeared on large numbers in comic books during the 1970s, was a disclaimer that stated, "Caricatures shown not intended to depict Artemia." The present disclaimer on the package states, "Illustration is fanciful, does not depict Artemia nyos."    Sea Monkeys were bred for their larger size and longer lifespan, making them more suitable as pets than the original breed of brine shrimp. The U.S. Patent 3,673,986  granted in 1972 describes this as "hatching brine shrimp or similar crustaceans in tap water to give the appearance of instantaneous hatching."    Many types of Sea-Monkey kits are now available. The company produces the original Ocean View tank as well as a variety of other products. The Sea-Monkeys company is now part of the Educational Insights corporation, and as of 2005 it is headed by George C. Atamian and son-in-law David Horvitz.    Other companies have distributed pets/toys along the Sea-Monkey model, including one by Wham-O, and "The Swarm", a product from Dr. Jordan's Formulae. In the late 1970s to early 1980s, sachets of "Sea Monsters" were sold in 25-cent gumball machines at A&P supermarkets. When added to water, the packet's contents provided the eggs, salt and nutrients to hatch the brine shrimp.    More recently, an Australian company, Little Aussie Products, has marketed "Itsy Bitsy Sea Dragons", with a different brine shrimp species, Parartemia zietziana.    The key ability of unhatched "Sea-Monkeys" to be packaged, shipped, and handled is that, in certain easily prepared environments, they enter cryptobiosis, a natural state of suspended animation. When released into the prepared aquarium they leave this state and emerge from their cysts. The genetic variant of brine shrimp, the Sea-Monkey, was given the term "instant life" to reflect the instant hatching seen when the cysts are added to the correctly balanced saltwater medium.      To start the process, the 'water purifier' package is added to water on day one. The user is typically unaware that this package already contains eggs in addition to the salt. At day two, one adds the 'instant life eggs' package, containing Epsom salts, borax and soda ash, in addition to eggs, yeast, and sometimes a blue or green dye. The dye is used to enhance the 'instant life' experience by making the freshly hatched animals more visible.    The Sea-Monkeys seen on the fifth day after adding the 'eggs package' are derived from the eggs added with the 'purifier' package. The food package is a mixture of Spirulina and dried yeast. The 'boost' packages mainly contains salts, which induce increased sexual activity in artemia.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Brine shrimp, Artemia salina.

M3ImexJoaa	Balancing the equation:    Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) ?> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)    Each mole of Mg will consume 2 moles of HCl, then 2.07 moles of Mg will consume 2 x 2.07 = 4.14 moles of HCl    Molar mass of HCl is 36.46 g/mole, then the mass of HCl consumed = 4.14 x 36.46 =  150.9444 g    Each mole of Mg will produce 1 mole of H2, then also 2.07 moles of H2 will be produced    Molar mass of H2 is 2 g/mole, then the mass of H2 produced = 2.07 x 2 = 4.14g|`|sCGWcJTFaa	well its because you need to find the mass of MgCl2 before you can find  the mass of HCl. then find the moles of HCl to find the moles of H2 and use it to find the mass of H2. too lazy to solve it for you right now.|`|uWf31f3Raa	(moles)(molar mss) = grams  (2.07 mol)(24.30 g/mol) = 50.301 grams Mg  the balanced equation should be:  Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) ~~> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)  Mg and HCl react in a 1:2 ratio,   (50.301 g)(2) = 100.602 grams HCl    with sig figs, 101g of HCl is consumed    Mg and H2 are in a 1:1 ratio so moles of Mg = moles H2  (2.07 mol H2)(2.016 g/mol H2) = 4.17g H2 produced

rDpk6Bkfaa	Actually, matter can technically be converted into energy, via nuclear reactions or antimatter/matter annihilation. I don't know if that counts as "destroyed" ... This is the E = MC2 thing.    What's happening with CO2 is the matter is changing form. The carbon may have been originally part of a hydrocarbon in gasoline or oil, and the oxygen was probably from our atmosphere. Oil buried in the ground does not affect our atmosphere, even though it is in the Earth. Oxygen is not a problem contributor to global warming. Oxygen keeps us alive :).    So, CO2 levels are rising while hydrocarbon and oxygen levels are decreasing. There is no overall change in the amount of matter. Only the form of the matter changed.    I have no idea how long it will take for the CO2 levels to start decreasing again. It takes hundreds of millions of years to make fossil fuels (hydrocarbons), but that doesn't matter. It's really how long it takes for the carbon to be converted back into any kind of biomass, via plants and trees, or some other kind of non-CO2 mass.    Plants/trees are actually not very efficient for converting CO2 to biomass via photosynthesis. They only do this while they are growing, using the carbon to make starch. After all, greenhouse gas reduction is not the most important trait for survival and evolution. However, because there are so many plants/trees, they are the largest factor in the reduction of CO2.    Undoubtedly, it will take longer without plants or trees... By then, human civilization will be another fossil, buried deep in the Earth.|`|EJSdI25Naa	When the earth was forming, there was no atmosphere. Then there was a lot of poisonous carbon dioxide available which, over the eons,  was chemically deducted from the atmosphere and turned into massive, world-wide chemical deposits of limestone. Carbon uptake by ancient forests has been preserved as coal seams. They have been a valuable energy source for the lat one and three quarter centuries.  But using them adds up to replacing a lot of that deducted carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. That makes the levels rise. So much is being released that whatever might be retaken by new tree growth is very small, especially so in the face of broad tree clearance schemes in many countries around the world. These gases will remain in their molecular state unless acted upon in some chemical, natural fashion. The low probability of that happening is next to zero, so the gases will never break up into their core elements again.|`|NhfKjvwcaa	The matter isn't created or destroyed! We derive our carbon from our petrochemicals! Our oxygen is from air! When carbon undergoes a combustion reaction it will bond with one or two oxygen atoms (depending on concentration of oxygen present). So literally levels of certain materials increases because of how the react in the atmosphere.     When you say "...How long does it take before they separate into their core elements again."    Elements don't have a period of time that they take to go back to how they were. chemicals go into another form by reactions they undergo, by what they are exposed to. i.e. when CO2 is dissolved in seawater it turns to H2CO3, which this acidic molecule reacts with the coral and kills it.|`|x5c7ek7paa	CO2 is highly oxized, without energy input it will stay this way, it is in an energy minimum. Trees use solar energy to reduce CO2 into sugars, which are higher potential energy.
26ece5583b9e251b1412b7ebc4bacd00aa	Arc circular function means inverse circular function.    If you have function y = Arc sin x  It means x = sin y    or x = arc sin y, it means y = sin x    These functions are used to find the measurement of angles, the value of whose circular function is given    i.e. if the value of sine of an angle is given to be 1 it means you have to find the measurement of the angle whose sine is 1 and it is 90 degrees or pi/2 radians.    Symbolically  y = arc sin 1  means sin y = 1  therefore, y is pi/2  So arc sin 1 = pi/2    Sine of an angle attains the same value after a period of 2 pi.    So arc sin 1 will be equal to pi/2, 5 pi/2, 9 pi/2 and so on.    arc sin 1/sqrt 2 = arc sin 0.7071 = pi/4, 5pi/4, 9pi/4 and so on.

You need 4/3 = 1.333, so there is too little Al, and Al is the limiting reagent.  (You clearly need more moles of Al than moles of O2 from the formula.)    For 3.057 moles of Al, you need (3/4)*3.057 moles of O2, or 2.293 moles of O2.  So the excess is 3.677 - 2.293 = 1.384 mole O2 = 44.23 g O2.
QCIMCYEWaa	Are you asking that if the whole universe is expanding why are some galaxies colliding?    Well if that is your question, the answer is that cosmic expansion only works on the large scale. For example, the Milky Way (our home galaxy) and the Andromeda galaxy are close enough for their gravitational pull on each other trumps the expansion of the universe.|`|A3RU9L1Raa	did a wee bit o calc on andromeda galaxy..if u eq8 its esc vel to Ro*Ho  and Ve=rt(2G*M/R) M=mass our galaxy, Ro=dist, Ho=Hubble const..u get R^3  >R0=2.47E22m..or 2.66M ly..current dist= 2.25M ly..so colln with Andromeda looks likely..gen princp..if separ8ion of galaxies>Ro their escp vel due 2 expansion >that due to grav attraction..then galaxies continue to move apart|`|jSPj3S6faa	The problem that you propose assumes that Universal Expansion will keep galaxies from colliding.  Universal Expansion occurs at the rate of 70.3 km per second per Megaparsec.  With the Andromeda Galaxy being a mere 0.77 Megaparsec distant, this means that even if both our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy did not move at all (relative to their surroundings), they would still be moving apart at just under 54 km per second.    However, it is perfectly okay for the Andromeda Galaxy to move relative to the fabric of space-time (that which is expanding) toward the Milky Way Galaxy... and it is.  In 1912, Vesto Slipher measured the radial velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy to be 300 km per second coming right at us (the Milky Way Galaxy).  (At that time, it was called the Andromeda Nebula because it was thought that it was an object within our galaxy.)    So here it comes at somewhere between 250-300 km per second... barely phased by the expansion of the Universe.  Of course, the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.3 x ten to the nineteenth power km away... so don't pack your bags quite yet.|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	have a look and read of NASA astronomy site  ,picture  archive is a good source.|`|AA10654797	If youve ever watched an explosion and seen the debris colliding with other debris, you wouldnt have to ask.|`|JYyOjAqdaa	Suppose you have an infinite amount of paths that all started at a common point, and every object that occupied every one of those infinite paths obeyed Isaac Newton's laws of motion.

z7BiMSWmaa	Tryptophan and tyrosine absorb ultraviolet light strongly at 280 nm. The tryptophan and tyrosine content of many proteins remains fairly constant, and so the absorbance of protein solutions at 280nm can be used to determine their concentration. The advantages of this method are that the procedure is simple to carry out, it is nondestructive, and no special reagents are required. The major disadvantage is that nucleic acids also absorb strongly at 280 nm and could therefore interfere with the measurement of the protein if they are present in sufficient concentrations. Even so, methods have been developed to overcome this problem, e.g., by measuring the absorbance at two different wavelengths
yzVGwQEwaa	Sexual reproduction is potentially helpful for all species.      To put it simply and quickly, sexual reproduction allows for faster and more diverse biodiversity, adaptation, and thus, evolution.  Let's say there are two lines of plants in a single species.  One line develops one advantage (and eliminates hundreds of thousands of non-advantageous mutations) while the other line evoles another.  Without sexual reproduction, those two advantages are unlikely to mix.  So, if you pit these two lines up against another species trying to occupy the same niche, if that other species has 2 similar lines except that they can reproduce sexually, those two advantages are likely to eventually occur in one individual, at which time that one individual will have a big advantage over the other individuals of both species.  An advantage such as this is cumulative.  That is, if you're strong and make many strong babies, your strong babies are likely to have more strong babies.  Where as a weak individual that is unable to make many babies, whose babies are unlikely to be able to make many, will tend to disappear from the gene pool.      There's more to it and many other possible examples but I hope this does it for ya.

FP5MsZ7iaa	There are many kind of edible plants that can be domesticated. But it is not that easy to move straight from wild to "plantation system" (and mono-cultural plantation is not always the best solution). Actually, most of the plants we cultivate now have gone trough a progressive move from wild to total domestication passing by several intermediate systems: for eg keeping useful plants and removing useless, throwing seeds in places where you might come again, when people are nomadic, mixed agro-forestry... etc.  Let's take the example of mushrooms. Many are edible and some even have a very high price on the market: like turfle. However, it is still difficult to master domestication process because it needs a special ecosystem.   Now a day, people have a selective approach on plant domestication: Does it have a good economic prospect or not.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	honey suckles...or some other type of sweet flower|`|yzVGwQEwaa	Any edible plant can be domesticated.  In fact, I believe there were many edible plants that were domesticated but have since been left to go wild.  Domestication of plants, to my understanding, is simply artificially selecting for its traits.  For example, if you were to gather a bunch of different milkweeds of the same species and cooked the green seed pods at the appropriate time, then, choosing to clone the one that tasted best, then growing seeds from the clone, you're domesticating that plant.      I think that a more interesting question would be, "Which edible plants should be domesticated?".

cJPOs7Tsaa	This really depends on the time of year, location, size of lake, and type of fish.  For instance, all the lakes near where I live contain trout, amongst a few other species. In winter, they all hunker down at the bottom of the lakes and remain dormant. Come spring, the lakes all begin to thaw at different times (smaller, higher elevation lakes wont thaw until summer). From April to June, you'll find trout near the shores of the thawed lakes, looking for insect nymphs. By July, they start looking for other food sources. If it's a large lake, it will still be pretty cool, and you'll still find trout close to shore. If it's small, the surface temperature may have very well exceeded a habitable temperature for the trout (they could even suffocate here, unlike a tropical fish), driving them deeper. Meanwhile, in July it's still early spring in the high elevations... the lakes have finally thawed, and the nymphs have just begun to emerge, so the fish are close to shore.    So your question is too general to be answered, given the choices you've given. In short, fish will follow their food source provided it's in a habitable temperature.|`|9gc6tYG3aa	Probably the upper warmer layer because most fish do like warm or sunny water.

AWPaPV4Eaa	These all have to do with the kinetic theory of gases, and not vapor pressure.  Unless you mean the vapor pressure above a liquid or solid by P and not the pressure of a gas.    A. True.  At absolute zero, molecules have no energy and cannot vibrate.    B. False.  When pressure is 0, (according to the ideal gas law), temperature will also be 0 - but this is in the Kelvin scale, not Celsius.  0 C is the freezing point of water.  Is there still pressure when it gets below freezing outside?  Of course there is, so this one is false.    A similar line of reasoning can be followed if you meant vapor pressure rather than pressure by P.  Ice stored in a freezer for a long time will sublime.  The effect is more obvious with dry ice - you can't preserve it in a freezer (several degrees C below 0) because it will sublime (has a high vapor pressure at this temperature).    C. True.  At absolute 0, there can be no molecular motion and thus no collisions with walls, no force on those walls, and no pressure.  The same holds for vapor pressure, as stationary molecules cannot escape from a condensed phase.

Remember because water, oil, and vinegar are not chemically bonded, they can be broken down by physical reactions such as shaking them in a bottle.    Another rule to remember is that a mixture can become homogeneous and then become heterogeneous and vice versa.    For example, blood is a homogenous mixture. But if you were to donate blood, the place where you donated it will often separate the plasma from the blood thus creating a heterogenous mixture with the plasma laying on top of the blood in a container.

There are two generally accepted ideas, a (divine) creator made us so, or we evolved somehow from other life forms (like algae or bacteria by way of primates, perhaps).    Generally, a simpler solution is more likely correct, but life on earth, (human, primate, canine, bacterium, tree, grass, algae) is so complex that I think the right thing to do is continue to learn about all the alternatives.

c4KcwDZZaa	Being carbonated, colas are acidic (carbonic acid is formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water), and so can react violently with basic chemicals, such as baking soda. Many colas also contain phosphoric acid and/or citric acid, which further increases the acidity.Colas containing phosphoric acid have been linked to chronic kidney disease.Drinking two or more of these colas per day more than doubled the incidence of kidney disease, while colas containing citric acid did not have an effect.    The Diet Coke and Mentos eruption is a popular experiment. Mentos candies and crystalline powders such as sugar and salt when added to cola (usually diet coke), cause fizzing by providing many micronucleation points for the carbon dioxide to leave solution. This however is a physical reaction resulting from the release of dissolved CO2 as opposed to a chemical reaction.    Another experiment involved adding dry ice, providing additional carbon dioxide can force some of the carbon dioxide present in the drink out of solution, creating an explosion, destroying the bottle.    In either case, mixing these substances with cola (or any other carbonated drink) causes the drink to bubble, creating foam and greatly increasing the pressure in the bottle, resulting in either the bottle or the cap giving way.

F'(0) = -1/0^2 = -1/0 is undefined,  The function doesn't have a tangent line at the given point. This is assuming that x + 1 isn't in parenthesis.|`|D4Ko5ll2aa	a) So you are being asked to find the derivative based on first principles?    f(x) = 1/(x + 1)  c = 0    [f(x) - f(0)] / (x - 0)  = [1 / (x + 1) - 1 / (0 + 1)] / (x - 0)  = [1 / (x + 1) - 1] / x  = [(1 - (x + 1)) / (x + 1)] / x  = -x / [x(x + 1)]    We want to find the limit as x approaches c, i.e. 0. Since this means we are interested in wherever that expression DOESN'T equal 0, only the points around it, we can divide through by x.    = -1 / (x + 1)    This is continuous around x = 0, so the limit will be a simple substitution of x = 0, which gives us -1.    b) Using the point-slope formula for a line, we can find the equation for the tangent. We know its slope (i.e. -1), and a point through which the line passes (i.e. (0, 1)). So we can use the formula:    y - 1 = -1(x - 0)  y = 1 - x
yrEuZXSOaa	The poly(A) tail is important for the nuclear export, translation and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time and when it is short enough the mRNA is enzymatically degraded, although a few cell types store mRNAs with short poly(A) tails for later activation by polyadenylation in the cytosol.    I do not think that it necessarily allows for the separation of the mRNA.

In other words it has a set of IR detectors and circuits that detect changes in their outputs.    .|`|uByFVvcIaa	Motion detectors pick up movement using radial Infra Red beams, which it emits around its field of view. When 1 or more of the IR beams are 'broken' (sensitivity can usually be adjusted) the motion detector sends a signal (sometimes to a light fixture or an alarm system) to carry out an action (Turn on the light or trigger the alarm).

Color is defined as how the light reflects off a certain object. It's difficult for me to explain.     Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky.    The colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum.

When copper is first absorbed in the gut it is transported to the liver bound to albumin. Copper is found in a variety of enzymes, including the copper centers of cytochrome c oxidase and the enzyme superoxide dismutase (containing copper and zinc). In addition to its enzymatic roles, copper is used for biological electron transport. The blue copper proteins that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin. The name "blue copper" comes from their intense blue color arising from a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) absorption band around 600 nm.    .|`|kOsJ63KFaa	Who knows, the same can be said of Steel, aluminum, zinc, magnesium..etc. We have grown to depend on all these metals.

b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	> How do humans affect life in the desert?    I live in California.  We kill the life in the desert.    a) We bring water to deserts to make golf courses and suburbs, thus replacing the original biological communities with something else  b) We killed all the big animals that at one time lived in the deserts:  the California and Mexican grizzlies, the jaguars, and most of the cougars too.  c) We killed a lot of the medium sized animals too, the specialized deer, pronghorn antelope, and things like bighorn sheep.  d) We dig up the slow-growing cactus and take it away to suburbs, where it dies because it gets planted in unsuitable soil and overwatered .  e) We build military target and test ranges in the desert.  This kills a lot of animals by dint of them getting blown up.  Many more die as a result of eating bits and pieces of lead or depleted uranium.  f) We pump water out of natural aquifers, which lowers the water table in the desert, leading to drying up of what had historically been natural water holes.  This leads to the death of the rare fish, and other, species that had lived in these holes.  g) We allow ATVs, motorbikes, and dune buggies to run over the plants, which kills them, and starves the animals that depended on the plants for food and shelter.  Remember:  slow growing.  Once run over, it takes years for an area to recover -- and it's not going to recover at all if it keeps getting run over.  (I blame former President Bush for some of this stupidity).  h) We introduce non-native animals to the deserts -- things like goats and donkeys.  They overgraze, which kills the plants there.

Ikeptu5taa	Regulation is a specific life function that basically is the control and coordination of all the activites and functions of an organism that help maintain its homeostasis - or internal balance. The two systems that make this up are:  1. Nervous - include both the central nervous system(made up of the brain, spinal cord, and interneurons) and the peripheral nervous system(includes all the neurons outside of the CNS and sensory and motor neurons). These neurons and the body parts communicate and act as the control center for everything that happens in your body. When you touch something extremely hot, an impulse is sent along a nerve to the spinal cord and then back down your arm, causing the arm to flinch back so that the body doesn't get extremely hurt. Both systems send messages back and forth to constantly maintain your body's homeostasis.  2. Endocrine system - this is made up of glands that secrete harmones directly into the blood. By doing this, this system helps increase/decrease the concentration of certain substances in your blood, so that everything stays within the threshold level. It also releases hormones as a response to a stimulus - ex. if you hear a loud noise and get scared, the adrenal glands will release hormones to get your body into a "fight or flight" stage, increasing heart beat to get more oxygen to your muscles, so that your body is prepared to run or attack.   i hope this helps u!

Remember that d = r * t.  Apply this to your table.    .................................. Distance .......................... Rate .....................

Let t(1) be the time it takes during the blizzard, and t(2) be the time for the rest of the trip.    Thus, we have 200miles = d(1) + d(2)    In each of the distances, distance is speed times time, so d(1) = 25mph*t(1) and d(2) = 55mph*t(2). Thus, 200miles = 25mph*t(1) + 55mph*t(2).    We also know that the total time, 4 hours, is the sum of the individual times, so 4hours = t(1) + t(2).    So, you have two equations.  200miles = 25mph*t(1) + 55 mph*t(2)  4hours = t(1) + t(2)  This is just a system of equations. Solve the second equation for t(1) and substitute into the first equation:  t(2) = 4 hours - t(1)  200miles = 25mph*t(1) + 55mph * (4hours - t(1))  Now that you only have one variable, solve.  200= 25*t(1) + 220 - 55*t(1)  -20 = -30*t(1)  t(1) = 2/3 hours  Now, substitute this value back into your second equation to solve for t(2), which is 3 1/3 hours.    So, they spent 2/3 hours (or 40 minutes) in the blizzard and 3 1/3 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes) driving.

Both of her parents will have genes that code for green and brown eyes (maybe even other colours). Depending on the specific combination that they get will determine what colour they have. Now it gets even more interesting. Explaining why hair colour isnt constant with eye colour is because these genes are on different chromosomes! Remember that chromosomes segregrate independantly. Recombination is also a possible answer, but this is probably unlikely because both genes must be on the same chromosome and it just gets complicated...Keep in mind, there are many ways genes express themselves, Ive only mentioned a possible way it could happen.|`|e9bYM4zmaa	is this a real question or is this like a problem on a worksheet?|`|BxVFuZaDaa	this is possible. one of the parents has to have been heterozygous for the gene for hair color and (the same or the other parent) for eye color because black hair and brown eyes are dominant alleles. so in order for the children to have had blue eyes or blonde hair, the parents must have each had a recessive allele for that gene. so either the mom or the dad must have had black hair and one or the other must have had brown eyes. one parent had to have black hair and one had to have brown eyes. they could have both had black hair and brown eyes but they both could not have had blonde hair and blue eyes.

One gallon is 231 cubic inches. Dividing 231 by 144 = 0.62 gallons. So a plant growing in about 1 square foot of soil needs a bit more than half a gallon of water a week to equal 1 inch. A 4 ft x 8 ft bed = 32 sq. ft. so at 0.62 gal/sq.ft. you'd want to give it about 20 gallons of water a week.     as the second choice!  WOW
jP5sIoOtaa	Law of Segregation  The Law of Segregation states that when any individual produces gametes, the copies of a gene separate, so that each gamete receives only one copy. A gamete will receive one allele or the other. The direct proof of this was later found when the process of meiosis came to be known. In meiosis the paternal and maternal chromosomes get separated and the alleles with the characters are segregated into two different gametes.
M3ImexJoaa	TiO2 is an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.    Used as a white food colouring, it has E number E171. Titanium dioxide is often used to whiten skim milk; this has been shown statistically to increase skim milk's palatability.

NwbgvzfXaa	Q1.  In circuit with just resistance, the current leads the voltage by 0 degrees (in phase). In a circuit with just capacitive reactance, the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees. So when resistance and capacitive reactance are both present, the resultant current leads the voltage somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees.    Q2.  Impedance is the algebraic result of all the reactive components and the resistances. The impedance triangle illustrates the phase angle between the resistance and impedance. This phase angle is the same as the phase angle between the current and the voltage.   But your answers list current with three different voltages. This seems to make this confusing, but it really isn't.  The current is the same for the source, the resistor and the reactive components. So when the current peaks, it peaks for all components at the same time.  However, the voltages are all separate and different. So when the voltage drop peaks across one component, it can be less across another component.  The source voltage is in phase with the current. And the voltage across the resistor (Vr) is in phase with the current. However, assuming that the inductive reactance does not equal the capacitive reactance, then the voltage across the combined reactive components (Vx) is out of phase with the current. Therefore, the phase difference is between the current and Vx.    Q3.  True power is power that is dissipated in resistance. Apparent power is the resultant power of current flowing through resistance and reactance.  power factor = true power / apparent power  power factor = 1000 / 1000  power factor = 1  This means one of two things. Either the circuit has only resistance, or, the circuit has an equal amount of inductive reactance and capacitive reactance so they algebraically cancel out.     Q4.  True power is power that is dissipated in resistance. Apparent power is the resultant power of current flowing through resistance and reactance.  power factor = true power / apparent power  power factor = 500 / 1000  power factor = 0.5  Because the inductive reactance causes the current to lag the voltage, it also causes the power factor to lag.    Q5.  Mutual inductance is calculated by multiplying the two inductor values, taking the square root of this product, then multiplying this root by the coupling factor.  mutual inductance = 0.5 * [(4mH)(9mH)]  mutual inductance = 0.5 * [(4 * 10^(-3))(9 * 10^(-3))]  mutual inductance = 0.5 * [36 * 10^(-6)]  mutual inductance = 0.5 * 6 * 10^(-3)  mutual inductance = 3 * 10^(-3)   mutual inductance = 3mH|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Q1)  1) leads, between 0 and 90    Q2) 1) ?

Divide the 3 constituents' weights by the smallest weight such that the smallest weight equals 1g, then the other two should end up being a mixed fraction.  multiply all 3 weights by the numbers necessary to convert those fractions into whole numbers.  if necessary, reduce all three by a common factor, and there you have your empirical formula.  4. 2 mol of nitrogen atoms are needed to make 1 mol of nitrogen gas molecules.  thus, just divide 5.8 in half.

mHcNl4N4aa	if the difference between two elements' electronegativity is >3 the bond is ionic. if its less than 1 it is covalent. This isn't the case often though. The difference in electronegativity is usually within these ranges, and then the bond is called polar. however, the bond leaning more towards covalency is called a covalent bond.  examples:  Caesium and fluoride. their electronegativity difference is more than 3. the bond between them will be ionic.  Hydrogen and iodine have a difference of 0.5 and the bond between them is covalent.  O-H will be the example of a polar bond. the difference between their electronegativities being 1.2      Ionic:  ~ transfer of electrons from the less less electronegative to more electronegative element.  ~ is present between a metal and non-metal  ~ the elements are bound by charge, transfer of electrons creates opposite charges  ~ form crystals. solids    Covalent:  ~ electron sharing between the elements.  ~ is present between two non-metals.  ~ form individual molecules  ~ elements are bound by proximity, have to be close to share the electrons  ~ form individual molecules. mostly gases. sometimes liquids.     Polar:  ~ unequal electron sharing between the elements. one element gets more share of the electron.  ~ can be between non metal and metal, or a non metal and non metal.  ~ two elements have fractional charges  ~ are gases or liquids      Sea of Electrons:  in metallic bonding the metals' outermost electrons are dislocated. they are free to move about  the piece of metal. while the atoms of the metal vibrate in their position. the movement of valence electrons is what creates a sea of electrons. and that is responsible for some properties of metals, like electrical conductivity

p0SOWgb5aa	For a start you don't do what most  people associate with it! A lot of people think marine biology=marine mammals; dolphins, whales, seals...  This is a misnomer, it's not actually like that. A few marine biologists do study marine mammals but that is a tiny minority.    So what is marine biology and what do marine biologists do?    It's not an easy question to answer because it's such a diverse field. Technically speaking marine biology is a science that deals with the animals, plants and other organisms that live and depend on bodies of saltwater, such as seas and oceans, for food and other necessities.It includes looking at things like nutrient cycles, growth rates, tidal cycles, fisheries and fishery models, respiration rates etc etc etc.    Some of the things I did at university when I got my BSc. in Marine Biology were: dissections (a lot) of marine organisms mainly fish and crabs,while dissecting: evaluating fish stomach contents and extracting the earstone to determine the age and determining the fish's gender, measuring algae growth rate by 'tagging' algae fronds and retrieving them a few months later, surveying bits of shoreline by collecting and cataloguing the organisms we found, fisheries survey which included fishing with a trawler and then evaluating (ie. dissecting and measuring) the catch, plankton surveys (collecting water from different depths in the water column and assessing, cataloguing and comparing plankton species found), intertidal survey on sandy shores (digging up sand and analysing it under the microscope to classify the microorganisms found). respiration rates of copepods at different temperatures, experiments on what determines prey choice in prawns by putting them in a y-maze, behavioural experiments such as determining if starfish have a preferential arm used for turning over, looking at intertidal communities by sectioning off a bit of shore, removing one species of animal and then looking at what happened to the other species. Since I also did zoology I had some other less marine experiments as well such as shoaling behaviour in guppies. chicken dissections, woodlouse in a maze experiments, feeding in flies....  Some of the classes I took were:        * Marine Biology Practical Skills       * Marine Organisms and Habitats      * Ecology and Evolution      * College Key Skills      * Marine Ecology and Evolution      * Physiology of Marine Organisms      * Marine Biology Intertidal Field Course      * Marine Conservation and Exploitation      * Marine Food Webs and Eco-systems    You should know that most people going into Marine Biology do at least a Masters after their BSc. and a lot of people go on to do Phd. as well, so it is very schooling intensive.     What exactly you end up doing once you have your degree depends heavily on the field you choose, you could spend the day processing water samples in the lab and counting algal cells under a microscope (for example if you study red tide), you could be analysing tissue samples to find out contaminant levels in different species of marine animals, you could be teaching at a university, you could be patrolling beaches for sea turtle nests, you could be cleaning out aquarium tanks, you could be involved in an environmental impact assessment, you could be devising a new plan to protect coastal communities, you could be writing grant proposals and meeting with potential sponsors, you could be on the computer doing research and reading up on papers relevant to your own research, you could be statistically analysing your data and writing up the results, you could be on the shore measuring algae fronds or setting up quadrants to study inter-tidal communities, you could be on the beach digging holes to obtain samples from deeper layers to assess the population of interstitial microfauna, you could be taking blood from crabs to determine hormone levels, you could be out on the boat doing research and experiments; for example fishing and evaluating the catch, or taking plankton samples- in short there is a lot of things you could be doing, from complete desk jobs to research jobs out at sea.

You might be diving in oceans or lakes to study or collect aquatic specimens.  Or it might be desk work study instead of hands-on study. You might be helping with marine animals at zoos, such as taking care of the animals or training them for shows.  Marine biology could also include organizing programs to clean up a polluted water system or to help distressed animals in a certain area (beached whales, migrating dolphins trapped in rivers).  Another possibility is traveling and educated people about various marine animals and how to protect them.  Basically, marine biology is working directly or indirectly with aquatic creatures.|`|wU7IHRvdaa	Um, yeah, what Cetacea said.

However, keep in mind that if the numerator had been zero, then you would have to do a little more work to find the answer.|`|Gg9bK7caaa	We only need x to be greater than 0. Since the number around and at 64 allow the root to be defined, we don't have a problem.

Note 0 is neither positive or negative at this point. The denominator could be positive or negative in our case.    Important fact: When you divide a nonzero number by a number very close to zero, the value of the expression tends to approach a very large number. 1/10000000000000000000000000 is close to zero. So, 56/(1/1000000000000000000) = is a very large number POSITIVE number.     Same that can be said by looking at number close to zero on the negative side, -1/1000000000000000. So, 56/(-1/000000000000000). This yields a very large NEGATIVE number.      Since the lim x-->64 implies we have to approach a 64 from both direction and converge to a common f(x) value, this is not possible, because a very large NEGATIVE number can never equal a very large POSITIVE number.     The answer b) "does not exist"

The limit of a function.

The actual cause appears to be a complex interaction of genetics, developmental conditions and environment.|`|AA11374522	First, let me stress that there is no universal consensus among psychologists  regarding the topic of why a person develops a particular sexual orientation. There have been studies that support both the "nature" and "nurture" arguments however, none of the research has been conclusive enough to allow for the full backing of either side. Most in the psychological field believe that sexual orientation is formed through a complex intermingling of both biological and environmental factors and that the vast majority of people have little to no choice in the matter.    While homosexuality was once considered a mental disorder, several decades of research have led us to conclude that homosexuality is a normal aspect of human sexuality. No direct link between homosexuality and any form of psychopathology has been observed. Homosexuals are no more inclined to suffer from mental disorders than heterosexuals.

cHjVskKraa	Rube Goldbergs are usually just a bit of a creative obstacle.  Just think of the various events that can occur.  You can knock things down, heat things up, vibrate things, set something into motion...     You'll need to have energy stored up in the system somewhere so think about ways to store energy.  A mass at a height is one example.  Usually the challenge is to constrain the mass's motion so that it goes where you intend.  Ropes, wheels, ramps, and slides can help with this.  Think of a marble rolling down a slide and hitting a domino.  Heck, there's two actions.  You could also just have a hamster wheel which starts to spin and hits the dominos.  Then you just need to transfer the energy from the dominos into something else.  Knock something else down, pull a string to release a door...     Just talking about it makes me want to go Rube Goldberg something.     I realize you're probably just working on a class project (if it's an intro to engineering course, uh, take this very seriously if you ever plan to get a job in the field).

491e3d836819bf014ff5701ec520d80caa	Yes and no... because Si is a larger atom, and has longer bond lengths and wider dihedral angles, the characteristic twist in the DNA helices would not be the same. Also, the aromatic properties of Si analogues are significantly reduced because of two things: 1) longer bond lengths and 2) reduced overlap of p-orbitals, resulting in lower aromaticity. Because adapting an aromatic arrangement is highly stabilizing for carbon systems, and not very stabilizing for Si systems, you would be hard-pressed to get this to work. The other part to think about is that since bond lengths are different, and electronegativities are different, you will have different pKa values for the base pairs and amino acids, resulting in a cornucopia of problems when it comes to actually having the Si-DNA function properly.    So in the end, you have a molecule that doesn't really want to twist, reduced aromaticity,different pKa's, an unstable aromatic, and larger bond lengths and angles. If you put all of this together, you don't have a very favorable system. Quick answer: it technically could be made, but that doesn't mean it will function or have properties anything close to DNA.|`|A3RU9L1Raa	maybe we cud bypass DNA altogether..doped silicon is used to construct logic gates..memories r made of this..evolution mite occur somewhere in the universe with natural analogues of our computers..after all the goal of AI is to produce sentient machines..who can say??|`|aBObYbpCaa	Even if such an analogue could exist, and the first poster gave good reasons why this is unlikely, what would your solvent system be?

EJSdI25Naa	I think that the speed of the interstellar space flight launched in 1976 is going at 18,000 miles per hour.    Light travels at 186,000 miles per second.

CjY63J7paa	your symptoms do sound similar to mine, at about the same age.  In my mid 20's I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, now i take a daily pill and all is good.  Hypothyroidism is very common and treatable.  If that is what you have, they give you small dose pill first and keep retesting your blood until you reach the proper TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels.  For the first 5 or 6 years, they rechecked my blood every year and usually had to up my medication dosage.  for the past 5 years my levels are good and I don't need to change my dose.  Remember, to give your doctor your symptoms, but don't necessarily question a specific diagnosis.  The Dr. may overlook something if you focus their diagnosis in one direction.  Many illnesses have overlapping symptoms and we don't always know what the Dr. is looking for.    I do hope that you test with low levels of TSH, because it is easy to fix and there are no negative side affects from the medication.  Also, the meds for thyroid are inexpensive...that is always a bonus.  Good Luck!

However, the body has normal defense and repair mechanisms that cause clotting, and close the ends of the broken blood vessels.  The blood will gradually be moved away by normal processes within a couple of days.      "It may be a subconjunctival hemorrhage. You are correct in that this is a broken vein on the surface of the eye. It can be do to coughing, sneezing, straining, or rubbing the eye. It is more likely in patients on blood thinners such as aspirin. If this is recurrent we sometimes recommend a blood workup to rule out any blood problems but this is uncommon.

stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence      The Bible also alludes to the Big Rip:   Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	We do not know when the universe began.    We know when the expansion began (what is described in the Big Bang theory):  13,700 million years ago.    In less than 1 million years, the human diaspora will not remember much about the questions and answers on Yahoo.  This is not necessarily a bad thing because keeping a record of all the nonsense about (say) the 2012 end-of-the-world hoax will make them wonder how the race survived at all.    Back to the "beginning":  when we run expansion backwards, we get to a universe so hot and so dense (in energy) -- at the Planck Time, when the universe was at the Planck Temperature -- where every single point in the universe would have been a black hole.     This means that every single point would have been part of an event horizon (of at least one adjoining point).    When we look at the behavior of time, we find that, from our frame of reference, time stops when we reach an event horizon.    Therefore, we say that the universe (at least, what we can perceive from our frame of reference) began at that moment.    We don't even know if the word "before" makes any sense, before that moment.    Presently, we feel irrelevant because we do not yet understand what is going on.  If we stop looking, then we will confirm that we are irrelevant.    If we continue looking, it may just be that we will know for sure that we are irrelevant... or not!    So, we continue looking.    And that is why we must continue to look, even after we'll have been forced off this puny rock by the lousy "weather" in a mere million years.    If you think something as simple as a little "solar fever" is going to stop me...|`|8Ddb4OQfaa	HOW DO YOU THINK IT WAS CREATED OR WAS THE BIG BANG REAL ?????|`|m09snBrEaa	there are a few different hypotheses about it, but ultimately we simply don't have the evidence to give you a specific scientific answer right now.|`|jSPj3S6faa	Aye, that's the rub.    In a nutshell, the latest quantum loop gravity theory proposes that the matter which constitutes the universe has always existed and will always exist.  The Big Bang is no longer considered the beginning of the Universe, but merely the event that marks the halfway-point in one of the Universe's life-cycles.    The latest real beginning of this universe was the start of the latest cycle that began something like this:    All matter is evenly distributed throughout a very large expanse of space. Since it was all evenly distributed, gravity held it all in place in perfect stillness. Therefore, time did not exist; because time is the flow of events; and the one event, the existence of all matter in an unmoving manner, does not constitute a flow.    Then something external to the universe disturbed its perfect stillness, time began, our universe began by Universal Contraction due to gravity. Stars and galaxies and worlds formed as the Universe contracted.     After several hundred billion years, there occurred the Big Crunch as all matter in the Universe crushed down to the maximum possible density, roughly a trillion suns' mass in the volume of a proton.    The fabric of spacetime was full; it could not contract any more. The remaining inrushing mass bounced off the maximized density creating the Big Bang.    The rest is the usual scientific history.    The end of this universe as we know it will be when all matter is distributed evenly throughout its entire space. Time will stop.    And at some point, it will start all over again.    Simple, huh?|`|35154496dadac252bb1dd3ed057615f8aa	I like to think we the universe came from a black hole in another universe. and every black hole in are universe makes a new universe once it consumes enough mater and falls from are plan of existence.|`|KdGJn4cSaa	dude go watch some doctor who. stop being a cynic.|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Who knows, we were not there when it was being made. You will know when you die and meet God.|`|qyihFhpsaa	Alrighty, I see we already have the Big Crunch theory present.    I'd like to speak up a little for M-Theory, just to play devil's advocate.    According to M-Theory, this fancy little universe we happen to find ourselves in is just one of many, contained within a larger MULTIVERSE!!! In this multiverse, there are any number of different universes, all floating around in these nice little space-time membranes.     Now, because these membranes are moving (the mechanism behind said movement as of yet unknown) some of them do tend to collide. It is at this point of collision, some scientists hypothesize, that the Big Bang took place. This Big Bang then, under this theory, was merely a sort of chain reaction, in which the (assumed) uniform environment contained within these membranes was thrown off by the collision.    Now, this theory does not have as much seamlessness as of yet that the Big Crunch theory does, but the idea of an outside source of matter/energy does help to reconcile many of the inherent problems with the four fundamental forces (strong force, weak force, gravity, and the speed of light), such as the relative weakness of gravity as compared to the other three.    For more information, please see here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory  From there I believe you can get to a less-technical version, but that should give you a little more of an idea of what I'm talking about.    And like I said, I'm not trying to argue against the Big Crunch theory, but you should know that there are more than just one idea as to where this all began.    -AND-    M-Theory does offer one thing that the Big Crunch theory does not: an idea of where all of this matter/energy came from in the first place, instead of just having to accept that everything always has and always will exist.    Slightly cleaner aftertaste, if I do say so myself...

Km9QC8a9aa	You probably could but you would need dry tinder and (probably) no wind. The wind will dissipate heat.    The bigger the magnifying glass, the more sunlight you focus onto a spot.  The amount of sunlight that you focus is a function of the square of the radius of the lens (*r^2.)    If you want to be sure about starting a fire, carry a tinder box along with you. That way you will always know that dry tinder is available (since you supply it yourself.)

It would take a while.    In grade school (3rd grade) I used 3 inch magnifying glass to melt tar, start fires, and stuff like that   I personally expect you'll find this not very useful, for any of its components.

AWPaPV4Eaa	Floating objects will displace a volume of water of the same weight as the object.  Because the density of water is 1g/mL, the balloon will float.  The helium balloon weighs 1000mL*.001g/mL = 1g (1mL = 1cm^3).  Because water has a density of 1g/mL, this corresponds to 1mL of water.  Note also that the helium balloon will float above the water unless the space above the water is evacuated (helium is less dense than air).    The density of gold is way higher than that of water, so it will sink.  Objects that sink displace a volume of water equal to the volume of the object.  In this case, this value is 50mL, so the gold will cause the greater rise in water level.

TMB4d3FAaa	Honey bees are fully grown when they emerge from their cocoons.  If it were a honey bee that you found in your basedment in mid winter she was probably out releiving herself.  They eat and heat the central swarm all winter and need to clean out their intestines.  They can't stay out long as they are cold blooded.  All the bees in the hive in winter are female.  They kick the males out so as to preserve the honey supply for next years members. They huddle in a  mass and with their body movements maintain a constant timperature of nearly 93F even in -40F weather. This allows them to survive the cold and raise new bees in midwinter.  They all die if they don't keep it warm. If she were out for a cleansing flight and all the windows etc were shut she probable has a nest in the wall.  You'll be getting more bees in the basement.  If she is another type of bee, she would be a pregnant queen that awoke to early.  She could survive on honey.  She woudl build a nest and raise a limited number of workers.  When these workers could take over the hive work, she would be about the business of laying eggs.  Either way, bees outside of their natural cycles don't have much of a chance to survive.  They will move slowly when they are cold.  Bees nearly stop when the weather gets below 50F.  Although queen bees have been known to live for up to 10 years, the others usually can't make it through a season.|`|e18d072e364cde72f131e9f26a7a62b0aa	it will definitely die without the hive because 98% of bees during the winter are worker bees and are fed in the hive  i'm not sure what you would be able to fed it but the best thing to do   is let if free to go back and help the hive  it is possible that he was either scouting for future food supplies but i dont believe he would purposefully look for heat because the hive full of bees will generate plenty of heat for themselves

First be sure to check out your eyes with a medical doctor as seeing aura- like things can be a  physical symptom of migraines and other disorders. so first protect yourself and be safe.    Now, if you are really starting to see auras...that is wonderful. They are your minds ability to see various health conditions and emotions of other living things. No they won't ever hurt you!!! They are your subconscious and right brain trying to communicate with you in a new and helpful way.  Please have a doctor check you out first! Then let us all know what is happening...or email.

AA10543440	Actually, the desired answer is b, but it's not DIRECTLY overhead, because Polaris is about 1 degree away from the pole.  Furthermore, due to the precession of the earth's axis, the pole makes a big loop every 23,000 years, and it's moving farther away from Polaris as you read this.

5al0K3N0aa	Yeah. Only 4% of the Universe contains baryonic matter. That is matter that is made up of protons and neutrons. 23% is then dark matter, which is non-baryonic. The rest (73%) is dark energy. We have ideas about what the dark matter is; for example there are cold dark matter and hot dark matter. But as for the dark energy; no one yet knows.    So the answer is b.    (Of course, they may not be expecting you to know this much about cosmology; in which case they would expect you to say e. Of the 4%, there is a lot more hydrogen than anything else.)|`|AA10222010	Here's your chance to tell your teacher he/she wrote a crappy question..!

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	The heart is "autogenic" or self-starting.  That is because it has a group of cells in the SA (sino-atrial) node (in humans, near where the two vena cavae enter the right atrium) that have "pacemaker potential."  These cells do not have a steady state resting potential.  Instead, the repolarization of the cells (after the previous action potential) causes special "funny" or "depolarization activated" channels to open.  The movement of ions (primarily sodium) through these channels causes a slow depolarization to threshold, so another action potential is fired.
b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	A tetanic (related to tetanus, NOT the ship!) contraction is a maximal one, caused by repeated stimulation.  The amount of tension able to be developed by an individual muscle is directly related to the amount of calcium present in the myoplasm, because it is the calcium that allows the interaction of actin and myosin.  Thus, in a maximal contraction, you would see the most calcium.

Unsaturated fats have double bonds in their hydrocarbon tails, making it difficult for the fat to pack together, that is why they are liquid. Fat's from plants are usually unsaturated.|`|bbwveGggaa	Wow do I have to do your homework for you again?  You got that wrong. Its actually the opposite way.

BDKqYOSraa	They are not bad because of their energy potential (they have plenty of that).    They are bad because they clog arteries.    Saturated fats "stick" to other substrates and each other very easily. This makes SFs a primary substance in atheromas: the clumps of fat deposited in artery walls.    They are the building blocks of narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis).  SFs increase the risk for heart disease and strokes.|`|tEldNDd2aa	I suck at chemistry, but from what I understand, in order for a fat to be considered "concentrated", it contains the maximum number of hydrogens attached to the carbons in the tail.

If the change is vertical the change in the numbers will affect the whole function.  Ex: y = f(x)  --->  y = c (fx)   Where c is some number    If the function is affected horizontally the change will occur close to the x like in your example. Here is another example for you.  Ex: y = f(x)  --->  y = f(cx)    Hope I could help. ^_^
B8IPlF8Baa	You need to prove that the operation is well-defined, associative, possessed of an identity, and possessed of inverses.    But actually, once you prove that it is well-defined, all the other properties follow IMMEDIATELY from the fact that they are true on G itself.|`|AA12148992	You are of course assuming H is a normal subgroup, right?  As this operation is well-defined, and makes G/H a group, iff H is normal.    Steve
IUmAflSqaa	i. The typical "subgroup test" is to take two elements x, y in H and show that xy^(-1) is in H.  So you want to show that, whenever ?(x) = ?(y) = eg', then ?(xy^(-1)) = e.  So, first, note that:    ?(y^(-1)) = ?(y)^(-1) = eg'^(-1) = eg'    (If you don't know the first fact that I used, i.e. ?(y^(-1)) = ?(y)^(-1), then... prove it!)  Then:    ?(xy^(-1)) = ?(x)?(y^(-1)) = eg' eg' = eg'    So H is a subgroup.    ii. So let h be in H, g in G.  Then:    ?(g^(-1)hg) = ?(g^(-1))?(h)?(g) = ?(g)^(-1) eg' ?(g) = ?(g)^(-1)?(g) = eg'    So g^(-1)hg is in H.  This says that H is normal!    iii. This is not necessarily true.  For example, if G' has more than one element, and if the homomorphism if ?(g) = eg' for all g in G, then H = G, and G/H is a group of one element, so it cannot be isomorphic to G'.  We need to add a condition here: ? must be surjective, i.e. for every g' in G', there must be an element g such that ?(g) = G.    So let's assume ? is surjective.  Here's an idea for a proof:    1. Define a new homomorphism ?':G/H -> G', defined by ?'(gH) = ?(g).  Show that this map is well-defined (i.e., no matter which coset representative I take for gH, I get the same value for ?'(gH)) and is a homomorphism.    2. Show that ?' is surjective.  This basically follows from the fact that ? is surjective.    3. Show that ?' is injective.  It's enough to show that Ker ?' = {eH}, where e is the identity of G.  (If you don't know this fact... try to show that, for any homomorphism ?: G -> G', Ker ? = {e} is equivalent to ? being injective.)    And a bijective homomorphism is an isomorphism!  Done!

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	When the Big Bang theory was formulated (by a priest) to explain the expansion that was visible for everyone to see, fervent atheists were against it.    The Big Bang theory was the only theory that explained (and still explains) what we observe in the universe, and still allows that the universe could have been created.  The theory does not state that it was created; it simply allows that it could have been.    Fred Hoyle was the best astrophysicist around when the theory came out.  He was a very convinced atheist (and he was proud to say so publicly).    He was supporting another theory called Steady State, which he found superior because it explained the universe (including the expansion) without a need for a god:  eternal universe = no creation = no Creator.    As far as he was concerned, the "other" theory (especially given it was started by a priest) was just a trick to give God a role to play.    Fred is the one who gave it the awful name Big Bang, to make fun of the theory and to confuse people (many still think that an explosion was involved).    So, from the start, the Big Bang has always been rejected by fervent atheists.    That, at least, has not changed.    The theory itself explains the expansion from a state of very high energy density and temperature.  It does not explain how or why the universe was in that state (it takes it for granted).      Those who want to give it a religious twist would say that the pure energy was simply a manifestation of God.  But the theory does not care how or why the energy was there.  It simply explains what happens after the expansion begins.    ---    There are a few ideas that are being pursued by scientists to understand what could have happened before the expansion began.  But these cannot yet be tested (therefore, they can't really be called theories yet).    The Big Crunch to Big Bang cycle seems out. If it was something that mechanical, then we'd expect a conservation of energy.    If the previous universe Crunched, it would be because it total energy content was insufficient to counter the collapse.  However, in this "cycle" there is way too much energy to stop the expansion.  In fact the expansion is not even slowing down.  Where does the extra energy come from?  It cannot be from the previous universe (if the previous universe had contained all that energy, it would not have Crunched).      Most of the good ideas require the universe to have more dimensions that what we can perceive.  Some claim that the Large Hadron Collider might be able to tell us (indirectly) whether there are higher dimensions:  the types of particles that could be created in the collisions would be different if the higher dimension exist than if they don't.|`|stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence      The Bible also alludes to the Big Rip:   Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip|`|jSPj3S6faa	The Big Crunch.    According to the latest loop quantum gravity theory, the beginning of the universe was long before the Big Bang. In fact, this same theory states plainly that the matter that constitutes the universe has always existed and will always exist. Although the universe in which we now live can be traced back to the Big Bang, the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe.    The latest real beginning of this universe was the start of the latest cycle that began something like this:    All matter is evenly distributed throughout a very large expanse of space. Since it was all evenly distributed, gravity held it all in place in perfect stillness. Therefore, time did not exist; because time is the flow of events; and the one event, the existence of all matter in an unmoving manner, does not constitute a flow.    Then something external to the universe disturbed its perfect stillness, time began, our universe began by Universal Contraction due to gravity. Stars and galaxies and worlds formed as the Universe contracted.     After several hundred billion years, there occurred the Big Crunch as all matter in the Universe crushed down to the maximum possible density, roughly a trillion suns' mass in the volume of a proton.    The fabric of spacetime was full; it could not contract any more. The remaining inrushing mass bounced off the maximized density creating the Big Bang.    The rest is the usual scientific history.    The end of this universe as we know it will be when all matter is distributed evenly throughout its entire space. Time will stop.    And at some point, it will start all over again.    Simple, huh?|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	the only big bang i know about is when two idiot atheist bang there heads together. it takes a whole lot more faith to believe in this junk than in a master creator who is, God! look around you and ask yourself if this wonderful creation just banged and there it was.|`|ltdPoFsyaa	Very interesting question, and one of my favorite topics to discuss.

Steady State Universe, Big Bang, and Oscillating (repeated Bang, expansion, then contraction, another bang) have all competed in my lifetime.  Big Bang seems the best, with current science saying the expansion is becoming more rapid, and that it won't collapse back.      That doesn't mean that tomorrow a new set of observations doesn't lead to another conclusion!      If the big bang was the beginning of everything, then perhaps a study of religious doctrines (Bible, Koran, and others) can give you some insight, but that will be based on faith rather than science, which really does not know this kind of answer.|`|qyihFhpsaa	Alrighty, I see we already have the Big Crunch theory present.    I'd like to speak up a little for M-Theory, just to play devil's advocate.    According to M-Theory, this fancy little universe we happen to find ourselves in is just one of many, contained within a larger MULTIVERSE!!! In this multiverse, there are any number of different universes, all floating around in these nice little space-time membranes.     Now, because these membranes are moving (the mechanism behind said movement as of yet unknown) some of them do tend to collide. It is at this point of collision, some scientists hypothesize, that the Big Bang took place. This Big Bang then, under this theory, was merely a sort of chain reaction, in which the (assumed) uniform environment contained within these membranes was thrown off by the collision.    Now, this theory does not have as much seamlessness as of yet that the Big Crunch theory does, but the idea of an outside source of matter/energy does help to reconcile many of the inherent problems with the four fundamental forces (strong force, weak force, gravity, and the speed of light), such as the relative weakness of gravity as compared to the other three.    For more information, please see here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-theory  From there I believe you can get to a less-technical version, but that should give you a little more of an idea of what I'm talking about.    And like I said, I'm not trying to argue against the Big Crunch theory, but you should know that there are more than just one idea as to where this all began.    -AND-    M-Theory does offer one thing that the Big Crunch theory does not: an idea of where all of this matter/energy came from in the first place, instead of just having to accept that everything always has and always will exist.    Slightly cleaner aftertaste, if I do say so myself...|`|Ra5HCf1Baa	The Big Bang is the cosmological model of the universe that is best supported by all lines of scientific evidence and observation. As used by cosmologists, the term Big Bang generally refers to the idea that the universe has expanded from a primordial hot and dense initial condition at some finite time in the past, and continues to expand to this day.    Georges Lema?tre proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, although he called it his "hypothesis of the primeval atom". The framework for the model relies on Albert Einstein's General Relativity as formulated by Alexander Friedmann. After Edwin Hubble discovered in 1929 that the distances to far away galaxies were generally proportional to their redshifts, this observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity. If the distance between galaxy clusters is increasing today, everything must have been closer together in the past. This idea has been considered in detail back in time to extreme densities and temperatures, and large particle accelerators have been built to experiment on and test such conditions, resulting in significant confirmation of the theory, but these accelerators have limited capabilities to probe into such high energy regimes. Without any evidence associated with the earliest instant of the expansion, the Big Bang theory cannot and does not provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it describes and explains the general evolution of the universe since that instant. The observed abundances of the light elements throughout the cosmos closely match the calculated predictions for the formation of these elements from nuclear processes in the rapidly expanding and cooling first minutes of the universe, as logically and quantitatively detailed according to Big Bang nucleosynthesis.    Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the phrase "Big Bang" during a 1949 radio broadcast, as a derisive reference to a theory he did not subscribe to. Hoyle later helped considerably in the effort to figure out the nuclear pathway for building certain heavier elements from lighter ones. After the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, and especially when its collective frequencies sketched out a blackbody curve, most scientists were fairly convinced by the evidence that some Big Bang scenario must have occurred.|`|2JeCyjF8aa	The consciousness of energy.

We want to move the decimal point to the right, so that the first "block" of repeated digits appears before the decimal point.     If you multiply by 10, it moves the decimal point 1 place to the right.    We need to move the decimal place 2 places, so we need to multiply both sides by 100.    100 * x = 100 * 0.6565656565.......  100x = 65.65656565.......    Now subtract the original number x from both sides to get rid of the repeating decimals on the right.  100x - x = 65.65656565....... - x    Remember that x = 0.6565656565.......  100x - x = 65.65656565....... - 0.6565656565.......  99x = 65    Divide both sides by 99.  99x / 99 = 65 / 99  x = 65 / 99    Remember that x = 0.6565656565.......  x = 65 / 99  0.6565656565....... = 65 / 99    So, this means:  1.6565656565....... = 1 + 0.6565656565....... = 1 + (65 / 99) = 1 65/99    The mixed fraction is  1 65/99    You can also convert this into an improper fraction.  1 65/99 = [(1 * 99) + 65] / 99 = 164 / 99    ANSWER: 1 65/99 or 164/99|`|a6EEfOQTaa	If you get a TIX80 or something then hit the decimal to fraction button, it'll show you, but my guess is, 1and 65/100|`|if3hMsnVaa	This equals 164/99    Have a good day!|`|CCZAelRuaa	1 65/99|`|iIjsFLtjaa	= 1 65/99 or 164/99    Answer: 164/99 or 1 65/99|`|TINOKubBaa	let x = 1.656 ,,,   100x = 165.656 ....      now subtract like this:              100x = 165.656 ....  minus       x =    1.656...    works out to 99x = 164    x = 164/99    try to reduce if you can|`|OMaAef2xaa	to turn a recurring decimal inot a fraction you put it over 9 if its a single repeating  ex. 1.33333333 would be 1 3/9  with 2 recurring decimals it would be over 99  ex. 1.6565656565 would be 1 65/99    and so on.  =)

DhLIo8nbaa	Well I can tell you what I know.  I had a natural birth with my son and I was in and out of the hospital in two days and when I got home I was able to take care of my son, and was able to drive within a week and able to take care of my house within 2 weeks.  My sisters baby was due on Febuary 14, and she went into premature labor on January 6, and the baby was in distress so they had to take him emergency c section.  He is fine now but he was in the NICU for about 10 days, and she was in the hospital for about 5 days and when she got home she was in alot of pain, she wasnt able to do much, she couldnt even pick p her own baby because when you have a c section you have to make sure you dont pop your stsiches because you have staples on the inside of your belly.  So her baby is now almost a month old, and she is not allowed to drive for 6 weeks she is also not allwed to clean the house or do anything.  She just got to bathe her son for the first time last week because she is not allowed to bend down at the bathtub.  She is having a very hard time with everything because everyone else has to be there to help her with the baby because she canot do much. Its hard not being able to take care of your baby yourself and not be able to walk up the steps to get your son out of the crib when he is crying.  She is still in alot of pain and has to have someone at her house 24/7 to make sure she is okay.  I had a friend a couple months ago have to have a c section as well and she had to do all the same things that my sister had to do.         So I have found that they only like to do c sections when it is an emergency situation and they fel the baby is in danger.  Otherwise they would rather have natural child birth.  When you are actually pushing and having contractions and everything the natural childbirth is painful, but you heal alot faster so in the long run its worth it.  And the second they put that baby on your belly you forget about all that pain and that baby is the most amazing thing in the world.  I felt so bad for my sister because she did not get to experience that, they had to put her out for the c section and she was not awake while it happened so her baby was already a couple hours old before she woke up from the anestesia and her husband was there to see the baby but she wasnt, and she was very upset about that.         I am not saying that c sections are horrible because not all people have to be knocked out some just get a local anestesia and they are completely awake for it all but with my sis that wasnt the case, so it really all depends on the situation.  I am not sure if your pregnant and thats why your asking me this question, but if you are then I wish you the best of luck and dont worry about the labor everything will work out for you, I was really scared that my sister wasnt going to make it but her and her baby are doing wonderful now.|`|BDKqYOSraa	Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSVD or "natural birth", in your words) is always preferable.  NSVD is a normal, healthy physiologic process. It can occur with minimal or no medical intervention.   Outcome is usually favorable under ideal conditions:  uncomplicated pregnancy, healthy mother, healthy full-term fetus, adequate pelvic diameter, good fetal position    If these criteria are present, C-section is not recommended and would add unnecessary risk.    That said, this is an imperfect world.    Sometimes the pregnancy is complicated (eg. preeclampsia), the mother is not healthy (eg. diabetes), the fetus is not healthy (eg. nuchal cord), the pelvis is inadequate (eg. cephalopelvic disproportion) or the position is unfavorable (eg. footling breech presentation).  In some of these cases, the risks of anesthesia and the controlled trauma of cesarean section are outweighed by the benefits of avoiding the above complications.    C-Section Morbidity/mortality rates are much lower today than they were even 10 years ago.    Which is most appropriate? Only the mother's OB/Gyn can make that determination based on her hx and the above issues.

If you want to consume it, you need something called a "Bong" which is called a waterpipe at headshops. You just load the salvia in, put water in the correct spot and smoke it. You can't call it a bong at the headshops though, bong is the illegal term for it.|`|iwTLThD8aa	Salvia divinorum is a species of sage (the genus Salvia). There are approximately 1000 species of Salvia worldwide, but Salvia divinorum is the only vision-inducing species known. Salvia is a member of a very large family of plants known as the Labiatae. Because mint is a well-known member of this family, it is sometimes referred to as the mint family. Salvia divinorum makes a beautiful house plant, and it can be grown just for that reason, but most people who grow this plant are interested in its fascinating psychoactive effects.  The botanical name Salvia divinorum means "Sage of the Diviners." Under the right conditions, taken in the right way, Salvia produces a unique state of "divine inebriation." For hundreds of years, it has been used in religious and healing ceremonies by the Mazatec Indians, who live in the province of Oaxaca, in Mexico.    The effects of Salvia are very different from those of alcohol; but like alcohol, it impairs coordination. Never, ever, attempt to drive under the influence of salvia--doing so could prove fatal!    Salvia contains a chemical substance called salvinorin A. Salvinorin A is responsible for Salvia's mind-altering effects. It is not chemically related to any other psychoactive drug. Unlike most visionary compounds, it is not an alkaloid. Pure salvinorin A is extremely potent. Doses of only several hundred micrograms (millionths of a gram) will have an effect, and doses above 1 milligram (1/1000 of a gram) are too much for most people to handle comfortably. Because of its extreme potency, pure salvinorin A should never be used unless the dosage has been precisely measured with an extremely accurate chemist's scale. Fortunately, Salvia leaf is hundreds of times weaker than pure salvinorin A; therefore, Salvia leaf can be used much more safely.    Salvia leaf is physically quite safe. It is very gentle on the body. Toxicological studies have shown that salvinorin A is extraordinarily non-toxic. No one has ever died from a Salvia overdose. Salvia is not habit-forming or addictive. People who choose to use Salvia, tend to do so quite infrequently. Salvia is not a stimulant, it is not a sedative, it is not a narcotic, it is not a tranquilizer. Like many entheogens, at sufficiently high doses it can induce visions, yet it is quite different from other entheogens. Dale Pendell, in his book Pharmako/poeia, assigns Salvia divinorum to a unique pharmacological class, which he calls "existentia." This term alludes to the philosophical illumination Salvia seems to shine on the nature of existence itself.    SALVIA IS NOT A PARTY DRUG  This is important to understand. Salvia is not "fun" in the way that alcohol or Cannabis can be. If you try to party with Salvia you probably will not have a good experience.    Salvia is a consciousness-changing herb that can be used in a vision quest, or in a healing ritual. In the right setting, Salvia makes it possible to see visions. It is an herb with a long tradition of sacred use. It is useful for deep meditation. It is best taken in a quiet, nearly darkroom; either alone (if a sitter will not be used, see below for discussion of sitters), or with one or two good friends present. It should be taken either in silence or (sometimes) with soft pleasant music playing.    CURRENT LEGAL STATUS  Salvia divinorum is a legal plant in most of the world. But, please be aware of the following exceptions:     ? THE UNITED STATES: Salvia divinorum is classified as a controlled substance in the states of Missouri, Delaware, North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia, Oklahoma, and Ohio. Salvia divinorum is also illegal in the states of Louisiana and Tennessee, but only if intended for human consumption. A local law prohibits possession of Salvia divinorum in Suffolk County, New York. Salvia divinorum is entirely legal in all other states.     ? OTHER CONTRIES: Salvia divinorum is illegal in Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Lithuania. Spain prohibits the sale of Salvia divinorum, but not possession or use. In Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Estonia, it is illegal to import Salvia divinorum without a relevant prescription from a doctor. Salvia divinorum remains legal throughout the rest of the world.    Additional information about Salvia's legal status, and pending legislation that might affect it, is available at: http://sagewisdom.org/legalstatus.html.    The authors of this User's Guide are not attorneys and cannot render a legal opinion. If you have a question regarding the legal issues surrounding Salvia divinorum or salvinorin, you should consult an attorney knowledgeable about drug law.      SALVIA EXPERIENCES: WHAT TO EXPECT  Salvia experiences range in intensity from subtle to extremely powerful. This holds true for chewed leaves, smoked leaves, and for oral tinctures, such as "Sage Goddess Emerald Essence?."

hiGAR1Kmaa	May 22, 1960,  Valdivia, Chile,  see Great Chilean Earthquake,  Magnitude 9.5    Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean Earthquake is the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, rating 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale. Its resulting tsunami affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, south east Australia and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.  The epicentre was near Valdivia, Chile some 700 kilometres south of Santiago. It caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres. The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as 10.7 metres were recorded 10,000 kilometres from the epicentre, and as far away as Japan and the Philippines.      December 26, 2004,  off west coast northern Sumatra  see 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,  Manitude 9.3  The disaster is known by the scientific community as the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and is also known as the Asian Tsunami.    It was an undersea earthquake that occurred with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing more than 225,000 people in eleven countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 meters (100 feet). It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand were hardest hit.    With a magnitude of between 9.1 and 9.3, it is the second largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph. This earthquake had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm (0.5 inches) and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska.    There are two main types of scales that are used to measure earthquakes. The Richter scale, and the Mercalli scale.    The Richter scale is a standard scale used to compare earthquakes to one another. A seismograph measures ground movement but may also move itself during measurement (and is therefore often quite large). The Mercalli scale is used to measure earthquake intensity (commonly in the US) in roman numerals and often in conjunction with the Richter scale.|`|AA12139405	Dear sir. The boxing day Tsunami was sensed by my simple earthquake alarm for a total time of 12 minutes.Because I am 2040 K/M from the epicenter of earthquake that devastated the Asian country. I gave the warning 2 hours before Tsunami struck our coast.

j6jQ4Cq1aa	Green plants have a substance in them called chlorophyll which enable them to trap rays of sunlight and then used in the reaction of sunlight +water+carbon dioxide=food+oxygen+glucose  Chlorophyll is the pigment which makes a plant look green. It is kept inside the chloroplasts of a plant cell. When sunlight shines on the chlorophylll molecule, the energy is absorbed. The molecule then releases the energy. The energy makes carbon dioxide combine with water with the help of enzymes in the chloroplast|`|uE8FyJijaa	more like bore-ophyll|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Chlorophyll is the molecule in plants that is able to capture the energy from the sun.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	Excessive carbon dioxide could lead to respiratory acidosis. It makes the blood ph lower therefore making it acidic.    co2 react with blood to form carboxyhaemoglobine which makes it more acidic ie the pH value decreases    Carbon dioxide is converted into carbonic acid with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic acid breaks into bicarbonate and hydrogen ion. Hydrogen ion is responsible for change in pH. If carbon dioxide is used more for this conversion, then the partial pressure of carbondioxide will decrease.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	Carbon dioxide dissolves slightly in the blood to form a weak acid called carbonic acid, H2CO3, according to the following reaction:  CO2 + H2O --> H2CO3  This is why carbon dioxide is released.

AA12067875	This is an example of a solid-solute diffusing (dialyzing) thru a liquid. Solute CuSO4 crystals of high concentration (and darkest blue color) drop to the bottom of the test tube and leave little turquoise streaks as gravity makes crystals fall-drop to bottom of test tube.  Then it will start ionizing into Cu + and SO4- and diffusing (dialyse) through the clear solvent-water eventually forming a CuSo4 solution.  Diffusion-dialysis occurs by kinetic energy (moving from high conc of CuSo4 to low concentration of CuSo4 until it reaches equilibrium (and the crystals are all gone-dissolved) and the color is the same all thru the solution. The solution will be a very pretty tourquoise blue at the end.|`|ca6b4282da137b2d6e9fe9a1aa2faf59aa	Copper(II) Sulfate is used to test for the presence of water within a mixture.  If the substance contains water the CuSO4 will react and form copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate ( CuSO4[5H20] ), a mineral also called chalcanthite.  As it forms sulfate pentahydrate, the solution will turn blue, depending on the percent composition of the mixture.|`|8e2fc0d9eeaea4fc7ad3f7ed395621a8aa	did you mean in the test tube?
