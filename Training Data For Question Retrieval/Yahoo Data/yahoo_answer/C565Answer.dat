IRFbj0G9aa	Let me tell you something, if 3 or 4 times a week you can't stand to be around the woman you are going to spend the rest of your life with supposedly then there is a problem... postpone the wedding till you figure it out because once you've married her then it will be an ugly mess.  Think of it this way if you really love her than you would do everything in your power to prevent her being unhappy and trust me she will catch on and be unhappy because she will see your unhappiness.  I would go talk to a proffesional don't let this take you down... the longer you wait the worse you'll make it and  who knows maybe the solution is so simple and painless?!!!!!|`|jQBM2AGkaa	The best thing I think you can do is spend a few days away from her and figure out if it's the relationship making you unhappy, or you're unhappy altogether. If it's the first, then you know what you should do. However, it sounds like it may be the second, if what you wrote is you  being totally honest with yourself. Me and my boyfriend have often suffered with this seperately, both being people who have suffered bouts of depression, and we're still together and happy.<br>  <br>  Spend a couple of days away and then arrange to do something fun together after this. It doesn't have to be extravagant; watch a film or two, go for a walk, something you enjoy doing. See if you still click in the way you used to. Your head should be a bit clearer after this and you can make an informed decision, instead of just trying to work it all out whilst you're so confused. Good luck, I hope you get what you're wishing for!|`|3z8yuXZ9aa	your n your cold my friend<br>  <br>  seriously do you go out the a girl called katie? cuz these references are uncanny|`|Lb8nARxWaa	I HAVE TO SAY THATS A NEW ONE   LOVE BIPOLAR i thoughtn  i had know of all mental disorders but i will have to answer this honestly i think you have developed insecurity of playing the man that you think she expects and you srent all that. take a chill deppression or your love bipolar is just as fictional as the sadness you keep going thru just do what you did before you decided to set a day of marriage its a signed paper of agreement that you will alwys have your best and worst problems in life promised to be shared instead of alone . just simplify it gumby. are you setting up for something or a feeling you dont even need to bother with. how dare you when we are out here dealing with thoughts we cant get rid of for no reason. just keep it simple and dael with the day as it comes ..let her freak out .first thing if you want to be the fat dady man of the house youbetter get over yourself and be the strong one when she freaks over flowers and shoes . all you got is the inlaws for a day.show up drink champagne sign onthe dotted  line make her promise to be there for you and you be there for her and its all over day is done morning comes no sex but you got a great hangover and someone right by your side to moan and groan with.  and by the way maybe just take a drive or jog alone you still need you.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Odd how the only thing you mention about her is beautiful.

xmibEEdcaa	Try taking some decongestants before you fly. Sudafed is good, or anything marked for sinus relief will do.

pSpnjRsDaa	It all depends on what kind of cancer it is. Basil cell carcinoma is the least dangerous you can get. But melanoma is extremely dangerous if not caught early. Then there is sqamish cell carcinoma which mainly can cause disfigurement if not removed early. Don't think the worst. Sounds like they caught it early.|`|0b6b9f60bb6870d870e9293391c0c742aa	90% probably refers to the survival rate. Either that or how common out of all skin cancers it is. If it's the latter, then he probably has basal cell carcinoma which is highly curable and none too dangerous. if it's the former then he probably has an early stage melanoma. Either way, it sounds like his outlook is good, especially since he's only 15. Pediatric cancers of any sort have the highest cure rate of all cancers. Still, it's good to be there to support him through this. Even though it's very likely he'll survive, I can imagine there's still gonna be a lot of fear and uncertainty involved with this since it's cancer we're dealing with.
AA11595360	Does your Dad know about your OCD... He needs to know.. <br>  <br>  Your treatment the sooner you get it will be very valuable in your recovery. I am somewhat of a germ freak. I wash my hands constantly. I find myself thinking about who touched something and what they were doing and who touched them. I have safe places you seem to have your room.   Its best to keep your safe place your alone. You should have told your dad about this problem. So he would have known to keep the dog out.  I understand your frustration about the dog. No amount of reassurance will help you until you are ready to beleive that nothing is wrong with your room. <br>  <br>  OCD is very closely related to bipolar disorder. I see the anger in your message and your inability to seem to control it. You may be leaning toward Bipolar and not OCD.. <br>  <br>  SERIOUSLY GET ON SOME TYPE OF TREATMENT... YOUR LIFE WILL BE SO MORE PEACEFUL AFTER THAT.<br>  <br>  Can you speak to someone else like your mom about the issue. Maybe a grandparent. Someone else who has more understanding than your dad. Most adults (which i am one) think their children dont understand anything. They feel that kids havent lived thru what they have so how can the understand anything.  Some parents are so clueless because they are have grown up with a silver spoon in their mouth and never had to deal with anything or they have killed so many braincells that they are pretty much a vegetable that walks LOL... <br>  <br>  So you need to find someone you can talk to...to intervene at least.<br>  <br>  There are alot of people who know what you are going thru you need to find them... Sorry i cant help much from here. but GOOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  Yes your safe spot is something you need to keep safe. Its were you can go to relax. Not worry about the rest of the world.  You may need to vacuum the floor and use lysol spray. I use a room deodorizer all the time. The ones you plug in. I know in my brain that it doesnt do anything but it tricks me into thinking it works LOL... Weird odors are freaky to me too.  <br>  <br>  All of this is something that will be less of a problem with time... <br>  <br>  YEAH you really need to talk to your mom or at least someone. dont feel awkward its not something you did. Its something that needs help and most mom's are cool and they wouldnt be stupid about it. Just be very polite and kind to her and make her feel YOU NEED HER HELP... Trust me she'll step up to the plate.<br>  <br>  I GUARANTEE that you think talking about it will make things worse but it will be just the opposite.  I SWEAR TO GOD it will be like a huge load has been lifted off of you..  Its the fear that is stopping you I KNOW.. fear is what cause 99% of our problems. Once you get past that nothing can stop you. The fear thing is tough but anything worth doing is hard work!!
xmibEEdcaa	Get some over-the-counter wax softener -- Debrox is a good brand in the US -- and one of those small ear irrigation bulbs. Use the ear drops for three days or so. Sometimes the drops will soften it enough that it will come out on its own. If it doesn't after three days, then use the irrigation bulb to try to flush the wax out, using *warm* water. (Cold water will make you feel dizzy and sick.)<br>  <br>  If you still can't get it out, call your doctor's office and tell them that you need an ear irrigation and have already used a wax softener for three days.You usually don't even need to see a doctor for this: nurses are trained to do it. They'll use a big ole syringe to flush the wax out with water. It doesn't hurt at all, and you'll feel much better when it's done.|`|1SB67BXyaa	Try taking your finger out of it first.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	Don't get your panties in a bunch. its just ear wax blocking your eardrum,<br>  just get some wax softener/remover and you'll be fine|`|VK0czcdtaa	well first of all go to the docs.<br>  and the reason maybe that you <br>  are hearing the music too loud.<br>  just give your ears somerest <br>  and i bet them will be make to normal
DufCLIMsaa	WTF?  You need serious help.  Social Services.  YOU must be doing something if you're friends have broken up with yo and your mom has kicked you out - she or they haven't done it for no reason.  First, you need to learn to deal with depression.<br>  <br>  Listen to your doctor’s advice. If you aren’t sure you agree with it, get a second or third opinion. You can also talk to a pastor or Christian counselor to get help for depression.<br>  Step2<br>  If you have been prescribed medicine for depression, take it and keep taking it. Do not stop taking the medication just because you feel better or feel nothing.<br>  Step3<br>  Take the medication at the same time every day and don’t forget a dose, if possible. Make it a routine. Don’t tell yourself negative things.<br>  Be accountable to a friend or spouse. Make sure they know you are committed to taking the medication. Tell them to feel free to ask you if you are taking it, especially if they notice unusual behavior or attitudes. Remember that when you’re depressed, others can take the brunt of it, and they often notice it more than you do. This is why it’s so important to take your medication regularly. Often, if left untreated, you may end up suicidal or abusive to those around you. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to keep taking your medication unless told otherwise by a physician.<br>  Step5<br>  Keep a journal of your thoughts and feelings. Write down what you are sad about and what you are feeling. Write down what types of negative thoughts try to come into your mind. Then, praise yourself for doing what’s best for you and the family. Be proud that you didn’t hide behind your illness. You did something about it and you will reap a positive reward in the end. Your family will be happier and so will you.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk<br>  <br>  www.samaritans.org<br>  <br>  www.childline.org.uk<br>  <br>  help@nspcc.org.uk<br>  <br>  www.helplines.org.uk|`|N0sbhRu6aa	Lift weights.

At first it was difficult for the entire family to come to terms with the real issue. We too thought that they were trying to get our attention, although in a negative way. It was easier just to ignore them and hope that they would soon come to their senses. But, what really happened is that they got progressively worse. As a resullt, everyone seemed to lose their cool and relaliated. It wasn't until we had each one checked by the family doctor, that we discovered they both had a chemical imbalance and required special medication to rectify said problem.<br>  Now this may sound like a simple solution but for my girls it really was. They both changed dramatically and basically returned to their old selves; although they continued their medication for many years thereafter.<br>  I say all this to encourage you to see your family doctor first. Even if you have to pickup the phone and call yourself, but I'm sure your aunt would love to help.<br>  <br>  The key to this first step (seeing your Doc) is to be very candid with your doctor. You must tell yourself before you enter his office that "I NEED HELP, THEREFORE I MUST LET IT ALL OUT". Donot hold anything back put your pride and all fears aside and let it ripe. First of all you'll feel better just sharing your soul and secondly, your doctor will help you with a professional plan.<br>  All the best.|`|qgpXxcuGaa	Where do you live? As in what country?

You take a hit and hold it in your lungs for 30 seconds. seriously, that part is important. if you dont hold it in long enough, you wont feel its full effects. its gonna be kind of expensive depending on the extract strength that you get. for your first time you should start with 5x or 10x. that should cost you about 25 for a gram, maybe a little more in the haight because they pray on tourism. The package should have some instructions on dosing, but you pretty much want to put a little bit (maybe a 10th gram) in a pipe or water pipe and smoke it like i previously mentioned, and make sure you have a spotter that's gonna watch you for obvious reasons. have fun!|`|TepAZAHyaa	No it's not illegal but I couldn't tell you where to get it or what it would cost.

LsHkgexvaa	Depression could be a factor, also your depression medications(if there are any) could cause a absence of ejaculation.

AA10725882	"Denise" above is correct.  Do not give extra treatments on your own without the oncology team's knowledge.<br>  Blood checks are used to guide the treatment - the white blood cell counts must be monitored for dose adjustments.<br>  What concerns me is that this should have been explained in detail by the oncologist and his or her oncology nurses.  Your father should have been given all of this instruction.  If you were with you dad at the time of his office visits, you both should have been informed about the need to monitor white blood counts.<br>  <br>  If you did not accompany your father to the oncologist's office, I strongly encourage you to do so.  If you can't - due to work or school - you will have to depend on your father remembering the information that the oncology team is providing for him.  The problem is that many patients cannot remember what they have been told.   They are frightened and in shock.  A second set of ears can be very helpful to hear the advice given verbally in the office by the oncologist and the nurses..|`|AA11020187	Is what done with every cancer patient? The blood work?

xfpJGBfwaa	Well, you didn't mention the obvious, do you wash them?  I assume you do.  <br>  <br>  You need to rebalance the bacteria there.  <br>  <br>  1.  If you have yellow splitting thick nails, then go after the fungus with a Fungicure type tincture that you paint on.  <br>  <br>  2.  If you have itching, use an antifungal powder everyday after showering.  <br>  <br>  3.  Change all your shoes at once, or at least put them through the dryer cycle for as long as you dare.  Do them all at once, so you don't reinfect yourself over and over. <br>  <br>  4.  If it's not a fungus thing - then consider making a bath for your feet with lots of "probiotics" like acidophilus etc, in it.  Just open the capsules and put it in the water.  Repopulating your feet with "good bacteria" should crowd out the bad ones.  <br>  <br>  5.  Try different foot bath powders, especially those green ones like Foot Therapy Bath, to see which one works for you. <br>  <br>  6.  Stick to cotton socks, you can find thin ones if you look.  Wearing nylons always makes my feet smell.  <br>  <br>  Maybe your bf can switch to giving you "pedicures" before he massages?|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	You need to use a washcloth on your feet.

gb9REJN4aa	You do need to go to the hospital. You may need a tetanus shot and you may also need stitches (like, actually need them, not "I would like them in order to avoid scarring"). You definitely will want that cut to be GOOD and CLEAN, which the hospital will do for you. Your short-term solution is probably okay.<br>  <br>  Most hospitals will not stitch you up after 8 or maybe 10 hours, because they'll be worried about infection after that. If your housemate can get there in an hour, then don't call an ambulance. The hospital staff may be annoyed at you ("why did you wait so long?"), but you'll be physically okay.<br>  <br>  If you know you're up-to-date on tetanus and you have hydrogen peroxide (hurts a lot!) on hand and some antibiotics, then you can make your own judgment about the hospital. But they might give you antibiotics just in case, which is a good idea. So my final recommendation would be: yes to the hospital, no to the ambulance.|`|AA12262089	you might need a tetanus shot. there could be nerve damage later or loss of the muscle keep it clean and your bandages changed|`|AA10450290	Infection is the main problem. Call a taxi that would be cheaper.|`|K1iUzewyaa	Just as long as the bleeding has  stopped you should be alright. If you can take the pain, open the wound up and poor some hydrogen peroxide into the gash. This will kill any bacteria that may be lingering, and avoid infection. After that.. if you have some antibiotic ointment, place it around that area, or place a good amount on the gauze pad and place the gauze pad on the wound. If you absolutely cannot afford a doctor, look into getting some liquid stitches.. it all comes down to keeping the cut clean... you do not want an infection...|`|H2VxdK44aa	you can get a serious infection, such as a staph infection, which would not be good, staph infections can lead to amputation, just go to the hospital because it will be the best thing in a long run|`|qN4z0WB7aa	hold it closed tightly with a wash clothe thats wet. keep presure on it. if it doesnt stop bleeding in about 20 min. go to the doc. your health is more important than money|`|c0C2LCvuaa	um yeah. GO TO A HOSPITAL! dont leave it, it could get infected or become even more serious. i live where it doesnt matter if yu have health insurance or anything, but go!!|`|pvDVFrKwaa	You can get a serious infection if you dont get help. you might try looking up a free clinic online around your area and going there|`|I4tulYTzaa	I don't know if you need to go to the hospital. But I would recommend it. But if you do not go then you need to play doctor. For one the injury needs to be thoroughly clean and disinfected, this will hurt. Next you need to put neosporin on it. Then you need put on a butterfly bandage or bandaging that will keep the cut together. This will allow for quick healing and less scaring. Change and clean the bandage a minumum of twice a day. And good luck. Oh and if you begin to see excessive redness or a red line or start getting a feaver. Then you must 100% no questions asked go to the doctor. You have a infection that could kill you.|`|a5MzSF5qaa	Once the bleeding is under control, your next major concern is infection. Since it's deep, dirt could have entered like you said almost into the muscle. You may need some antibiotics to keep infection under control. Stitches help it heal faster, with less of a scar and prevents it from opening up again as easily. The muscle could have been damaged as could some tendons or ligaments. You may not feel the pain as bad now, but if it gets infected or it heals up the wrong way it could affect you later. I don't think an ambulance is necessary, but maybe  have a doc take a look.|`|qW55yhR1aa	Yes, there are other reasons.<br>  <br>  Stitching up the cut by a professional ensure 1. the cut is clean 2. the risk of infection severely declines.<br>  <br>  Infection would be the thing I'm most worried about in that scenario since you say you can skill walk on it.  If it stopped bleeding that's also a good sign.<br>  <br>  Call up your housemate and ask her if she can come home early or take a break from work to drive you.  If she can't I think it's still safe to wait for her, but monitor the cut carefully and keep it closed.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there's no way around getting stitches. you need them.|`|uPqtcXHvaa	Two things you need to worry about now:<br>  <br>  1. The scar that will result from not having a large wound like that stitched together.  If you're okay with a scar on your leg, no big deal.<br>  <br>  2. Infection.  If your cut heals without pus or anything ugly, you might be all right.  I'd worry about tetanus or some other infection as well--fishtank glass might not be the cleanest stuff to be cut with.  Did you use an antiseptic or something on your cut?  That would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  You might be fine--just keep the wound clean and protected.  A trick you might try:  hold the edges of your cut together with superglue.  Really.  It might help reduce a larger scar.  Keep applying for several weeks until things really heal up (it will take a while).|`|T8ksKCWCaa	You need a tetanus shot.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Main reason for going to hospital?  Infection and the chance there may be tiny shards of glass in the cut.  You want your leg amputated?  Go the hospital as soon as someone can take you.

They used to have bells by the sides of the graves that attached to the inside of the coffin. If in the off chance someone was buried alive and woke up, they could ring the bell and be rescued.

I know it is easier said than done, but give it a try.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Do some deep breathing and relax before interviews.  It also really helps to try to practice what answers you will give to common questions.  Take a deep, slow breath before you start to speak.<br>  <br>  Improving your posture means continually reminding yourself to sit up straight and keep your shoulders back.  The best thing to do about this is to try to use good posture more often all the time, so it feels more natural in an interview setting.

ufgv7oTjaa	None.<br>  Melatonin doesn't force someone to fall asleep, it helps their body to be able to fall asleep. It specifically helps to support the production of Serotonin, which is the hormone that regulates both the sleeping and waking cycles.<br>  The problem that too many people come across is that they use it like a sleeping pill and use more if they can't sleep, but that's the worst thing to do. When you get a little Serotonin, your body gets the signal to go to sleep, which is why Melatonin works so well for so many people. But if you get too much Serotonin, your body actually gets the signal to wake up, so if you take more than 1 pill, you might be awake for a few hours.<br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|D8SpQAgLaa	A lot.<br>  And when you woke up, you would be groggy. A large amount of melatonin can stay in your body for 24 hrs or longer.
ufgv7oTjaa	Ginger can help to soothe an upset stomach very nicely. You could try like 1/4 to 1/2 tsp mixed into water or something to help the taste. If you have real Ginger cookies or other foods, you could use that, too, but many of the foods don't have real Ginger (like Ginger Ale for example).<br>  But yeah, BRAT works well (Banana, Rice, Apple, Toast) works nicely as well if you don't have or like Ginger. Good luck!|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	Yes, 7up.  Seriously I promise you its worked for me.  You might not want more than a sip or two at a time, but it works.  Also Chamomile tea mixed with peppermint tea works on calming the stomach nerves.  I am telling you what worked for me every single month when I had a period so bad that I vomited each first day of it and it left me simply in tears crying like a baby.  From experience this works.|`|IDgSVPBxaa	If you got some flat coca cola or pepsi that works good.  Also Ginger Ale or 7 Up with saltine crackers works for me.  Also peppermint is good for this too.
5TLGa3awaa	Well, I can only say what's worked for me.  Certain Dri.  You use it along with your regular deoderant.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  It can be a little irritating at first but it's effective.  If you've tried that and still no luck it might be time to visit your doc and see if there's an underlying reason that's causing you to perspire so much. <br>  With me it also seems to be anxiety.  It used to get worse when I was anxious over something.|`|3rvsG372aa	Go to the doctors and get a prescription strength antiperspirant.  That will be most effective.|`|hx6oJGKMaa	im being serious about my answer. make sure you shave your arm pits frequently and wear any clinically proven antiperspirant try degree as well if all those fail ask your doctor about it and he or she should be able to fix that problem also don't wear any clothing that will make you sweat <br>  if your having problems with sweat stains in your clothes then there is no help for that. those are one of the many stains that you cant get out ive tried everything as well

c68nVKIYaa	Have a look at the website of Christa Lehnert-Schroth, who treated thousands of patients in her 50-year career as a physical therapist specializing in scoliosis. She posted the English translation of her article on exercises that post-operative (spinal fusion) patients can and should to to maintain healthy posture. It can be tempting to slouch and adopt positions that will cause your torso posture to deteriorate.|`|8WYWEDOpaa	Nothing.  Now that your back is treated, fixing your rib cage is cosmetic surgery and would be at least as difficult as your spine fusion.  *I* certainly wouldn't want to go through that again.<br>  <br>  Can you describe your back problems a bit better?  Are your ribs hurting?
3S3XjvYcaa	about 40 minutes, calories burned during HIIT don't matter, it works on a different, more effective principle.  the reason HIIT is done for a short duration is to use up all glycogen storages (excess glucose in the muscles and liver), because glycogen provides your body quick energy which takes abt 15 min of exercise to use up fully.  after that your body must resort to fat and muscle mass if you did cardio for longer, like 30+ minutes, like a lot of ppl do, jogging for 40 minutes on a treadmill.  they work on the principle of burning maximum calories and using up fat storages by working out longer than 15 min.  however, w/HIIT after you have finished your body's metabolic speeds up a lot as a result of high intensity training, this does not happen as effectively with lower intensity training, like jogging, or walking.  so when the metabolism speeds up it starts burning up free fatty acids very effectively.  this results in greater fat loss than if you were to just use the treadmill or whatever for a longer time and use up the fat through the workout in the 1st place, because if you did that energy would also be taken from muscle mass, which is not true of HIIT.  don't worry abt heart rate, stick to the HIIT and you'll do fine if you do it properly.
ALpevPl9aa	No, it will not get you high, and yes it is very bad for you. most people think that it's not, but it it.

6PhSENcXaa	If you doctor is not listening to you and you feel he's not diagnosing you correctly then see another doctor.  Fire him right away.  <br>  85 is to low, you should be at; at least 110 to 120.  That's the range my two doctors have me stay at.  <br>  When these two doctors diagnose me I also had 3 more doctors diagnose me too.  Then I knew that I was hypoglycemic.  I have several<br>  books on this that I've read. I also keep glucose tablets around in case I need them. <br>  See another doctor to be sure, 2 more if you have to, but make sure.|`|8asG4WCwaa	Actually, hypoglycemia is often associated with the development of diabetes, so, the first doctor is not wrong.  Many people suffer from hypo episodes for years and eventually do become diabetic because their  insulin/glucose/glucagon system is impaired (the exact cause can be many things, as the endocrine system is very complex).<br>  <br>  Hypoglycemia can be caused by hyperinsulinemia (too much insulin, frequently leads to type 2 diabetes) or hypoglucagonaemia (too little glucagon, not as common). <br>  <br>  Hyperglycemia can be caused by hypoinsulinemia (too little insulin, type 1 diabetes) or hyperglucagaemia (too much glucagon, rare but it i a subtype of type 1)<br>  <br>  Both types of diabetes can develop at any age and weight, regaurdless of diet and exercise, and with or with a genetic predisposition.  There are several subtypes of both type 1 and 2 (including MODY and LADA).  Don't think that your age and weight are proof that you are not diabetic.|`|yejCnhctaa	Sounds like you are hypoglycemic, you need to get another opinion.
TdqeC0vmaa	well other than genetics their isn't really anyway to know what chances you have of getting it. And there are people whose parents have it who do not end up having it. <br>  <br>  Their isn't really a way to decrease predisposition. But knowing that she does have a genetic susceptibility it would be a very good idea for her to stay away from drugs. Drugs do not cause someone to have schizophrenia but if they are predisposed it can trigger their first episode. <br>  <br>  Pot, Acid lcd shrooms etc<br>  <br>  she may not have it or be predisposed to it but why press your luck.|`|99AEKeUWaa	There really is not a way to decrease the chances. It isnt like cancer or a bacterial infection where there are preventative steps, it is just something that is wrong with the brain. The best that can be done is to monitor her and make sure she isnt starting to get it.|`|iDZXVfbbaa	Using narcotics may increase the chances.

3rvsG372aa	This sounds like trust issues to me.  You don't trust him being away from you, so you need to keep him close.  You just have to put yourself in your shoes sometimes, and relax.  He's going to his friend's house for a night, which means the next time he's not, it's going to be that much better for you.  He has a good friend that he used to date.  This only means he'll have a girl to turn to if you have having problems so that he doesn't do anything stupid.  He's not going to run off with her, that's only in fairy tales.  And finally you have to let the past go.  If he cheats again, then you have to break it off, but everybody makes mistakes.<br>  <br>  If you can't trust him, then your relationship is not going to last.  If he can't be trusted, then your relationship is not going to last.  It's hard to deal with, I know, I've gone through this before, but either you come to an understanding and trust him or things are only going to get harder and more hurtful later on.|`|WsROhHHsaa	yoga.............it helps a lot, especially the breathing exercises.|`|HTCwqbqXaa	I can honestly say that I can understand your situation.

SAY IT OVER GIRL.|`|WMieLPauaa	first of all take a breather, this sort of thing happens a lot in relationships, there's nothing wrong with you<br>  <br>  if you really love him, remember love is about willing to make compromises for each other. after you guys have taken a break, i think you should take the time to really sit down with each other and calmly talk about the things that each of you don't like about your relationship. if you listen to his opinions and respect them, he'll appreciate it AND you'll be less likely to get angry.<br>  <br>  also remember if these things don't work you may be better off trying to find a new guy who has better patience for dealing with your flaws. everyone has flaws, and although it may be hard, it's important for you to be with a guy who truly loves you for who you are.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Not to sound mean...Why did he wait so long to leave you?<br>  You're selfish, jealous, argumentative and by your own admission "manipulative" and WAY toooooo possessive!<br>  <br>  In my opinion, and that is what is what you asked for, if he takes you back, he deserves what he gets!|`|WHN5cuGZaa	omg my girtlfriend is like that two =((
fmgPKOaraa	it's not just eating low carb foods, it's also important how much and when you eat? are you eating 5 small meals a day, spaced no more than 4 hours apart? are you drinking lots of water - at least 2 liters? btw, cottage cheese is not low carb and cheese should be limited. the meat that you are eating should be limited to about 3 to 4 oz, as well. how many salads do you eat a day? one? try two.<br>  <br>  it's too soon to see results, but if you've been following a fairly low carb diet you should start to be in ketosis, which is when your body switches to fat burning vs. carb burning. get some ketostix from your local drugstore and test your urine to see if you have started the process. if so, you should see some nice results in about another 7-10 days...<br>  <br>  good luck!

Sleep surely has an effect on the human body. I've been through times where we only got a couple of hours of sleep a night for days on end, and you start making stupid decisions on day2 . You can't concentrate not even think straight, your body starts to feel weak and you get agitated easily.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	yeah it can do<br>  <br>  it can effect your behaviour, your mood and possibly or brain function.<br>  <br>  So yeah, you knida need to sleep :)<br>  <br>  <br>  But it doesn't matter if you have those odd days lol ;)
ltXxNfwRaa	Might wanna wait till your wisdom teeth come in.  Braces cost a lot and you don't want to wear them for so long just to have your wisdom teeth come in and mess them all up again!  And removing your wisdom teeth will make the space, but every jaw is set up different.  See if there's a way to get the wisdom teeth out before they surface.  Some people's wisdom teeth never come in, so if you wait for them, you could be waiting a long time!  Talk to your Ortho and your regular Dentist if you have any options.  I had braces so I know how much of a pain in the a s s it is to have to get them a 2nd time!  Its like 5 grand to get them the first time, you don't wanna have to double that!  That, and I'm 27 and some of my wisdom teeth STILL havent fully surfaced!!|`|t0K6Haoyaa	well I had braces before my wisdom teeth came out. You need to let your wisdom teeth start to bother you in the back like you'll notice them, but not pain. You can go get them taken out by a specialist. I had to have four teeth pulled out of my mouth before I had my braces put in. They put my braces on, and I had my braces for two years. I had them off for a year when my molars started coming out...sorry my wisdom teeth. If they bother you, then go get them taken out before a problem occurs.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	My wisdom teeth crowded my other teeth as well.

Eating lots of chocolate and stuff with salt (potato chips, pretzels, etc) will generally cause you to have worse cramps than if you don't eat as much of those food items.  <br>  I've found (recently) that using a Thermacare heat pad (the kind you stick on where it hurts) at the lower part of my abs have helped me.

AA11782843	There's nothing you can do.  The wisdom teeth are the teeth behind your molars in the back, (hidden under the gums)  that need to be removed.  Some people have them kept in, but your dentist probably noticed that they were growing crooked in your mouth.

They are hard to keep clean with brushing and flossing, they aren't used much for chewing (because they are so far back), and the gums sometimes partially cover these teeth (so they are "impacted"), so a lot of people (me included) would tell you that these teeth are more trouble than they are worth.  Unless you have some sort of an allergy to pain medicines, the nitrous oxide and injections that the dentist (or dental surgeon) will likely give you will keep you from being in pain when the tooth/teeth are pulled, and I only had some minor soreness the next day - I never took anything stronger than a Tylenol.  <br>  <br>  I suspect the reason your dentist wants to pull two teeth is that these two teeth are the upper and lower tooth on the same side (of your mouth).  Often, if only one wisdom tooth is pulled, the other one on the same side grows unacceptably long (because it then not longer has another tooth to keep it in check when you bite down).   <br>  <br>  As far as the process of taking it out, once the area in the mouth has been anesthized, often it merely involves grabbing the tooth with some sort of dental instrument that is basically a specialized dental grabber or pliers and then simply pulling the tooth out by the roots.  If the tooth is already damaged, it may require a bit of additional surgery to be able to secure the tooth enough to extract it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and I am sure when you look back on this in a few years you will be glad you did it.|`|bc9jGehhaa	Youngest age to get a wisdom tooth is 18 years old, so it's not.<br>  The wisdom tooth is always in the back.<br>  If more then 80% of the tooth loss bone it will be remove in order not to damage the other teeth.<br>  The tooth from the back has to be removed they will cut it in half pull out one half then the other a painless process.<br>  Take week off of school:)<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is Dentist, that's how I know.|`|jORX45ngaa	i dont think you have your wisdom teeth grown in yet. my sister was 16 when she had to get hers pulled out. the very back teeth are your molars. ive never had to take them out. <br>  i got my teeth pulled just this friday, four of them. theyll give you the choice of getting shots or the laughing gas if youre too aprehensive. i got the shots, because ive had shots before. when you get shots its just a little prick on your gums. when they pull it out, it doesnt really hurt because your mouth will be fully numb. you can hear it but cant really feel it. your mouth will hurt for a couple days, but it might be different between me and you, because i had to get spacers also.<br>  i hope this help, and good luck at the dentist!

They say jump roping can be an even better workout that running. It works you out a lot! <br>  <br>  Once you get the basic jump roping down, try doing circuits like jump roping for a few minutes, then doing a little hula hooping. Then, jump rope for a few minutes again and do a few jumping jacks. <br>  <br>  Also, something I want to get into more is jump rope routine. Look up jump rope routine on the internet. There are so many neat dance or exercise movements that can be worked into the jump roping. Like, can you jump rope on one foot? Can you jump rope while doing jumping jacks. Continue adding neat tricks into your jump roping and it will be a fun and challenging way to work out! <br>  <br>  You can even add music into your jump roping. Go onto YouTube, and look for jump rope routines, there are some really neat ones to inspire you. Some people are really good at it! <br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)

Then you can check and see if you can do your regular turning.<br>  <br>  If this does not work, I would call your orthodontist and see if you can pop in sometime for them to check it and make sure that it is being done correctly and thy can also check and make sure nothing is wrong with your expanded as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!

More calories means more fat. And you can cut out the glutamine. Glutamine is an amino acid. You already get more than enough glutamine in your diet. Taking a glutamine supplement is like adding a thimbleful to a barrel. And you can cut out the Lipo 6X. It's nothing more than a caffeine pill.

You should start there and once you get boared or your body gets used of the exercises you can move to a gym, that has different cardio and weight machines.|`|sR0pOtqjaa	joining curves might be good to have a network of social support ... but the rest it's up to you to resist the temptation of eating more than you consume.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I have been to Curves and liked it.

57Avg06Waa	Yes, it is possible. For example, if you eat 2 watermelons a day, it's obvious that you will gain weight.|`|IkVWct7laa	Just because something is healthy doesn't mean an overdose will make you lose weight.  A detox is meant to "teach" your body not to crave certain foods, and also to "flush" certain things from your body.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes a sudden change in diet can cause the body to essentially go into shock mode and refuse to make bowel movements.  If this is the case, bloating will almost always occur and you will gain weight only because you haven't gotten rid of any weight.<br>  <br>  Fruits also have a lot of sugar and water in them, but no protein.  The body needs protein in order to digest properly, so this could be causing you some issues as well.  <br>  <br>  Try taking a fiber supplement (the kind you can dissolve in water) and getting some protein into your diet.  You can do this without adding much fat by eating foods like tuna, salmon, skinless chicken, or even a spoonful of reduced fat peanut butter.  You could also get protein powder and mix it with your fruit and some ice and make a smoothie.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|41EWXXP9aa	I think it can be possible if your stomach becomes bloated due to lack of food<br>  Best way is to mix it with some meats/sources of protein e.g beans and keep on exercising , also drink water :)|`|g2h6qUUXaa	it's not possible to gain weight on fruit|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You are probably bloated because you are not eating enough food to survive.

ubPOjh0qaa	Just think of all the people in your life who love you. Look at celebritys who are heavy, and just know that you are beautiful. The stick skinny people are the scarey looking ones... some of my best friends are huge! But i love them anyways because they have great personalities. Just put forth an air of CONFIDENCE, and no one will care about how much you weigh. And ignore those b*tches who call you fat, they're just so low on their own self esteem that they want to take it out on anyone they can. Afte they call you names, they turn around to the girl behind them and start making fun of her because she's too skinny.

You cannot be happy and fat unless you are a comedian.|`|Tts9ID4oaa	Hi, I am a personal trainer, and I can tell you that you will never be truly happy as you are.  It is obvious you want the things that come with being in better shape...desired by others, comfortable with your self, and feeling healthy.<br>  <br>  But you can't get these things from Jenny Craig, or any other diet.  To lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you consume.  It really is as simple as that...and that is called the Law of Thermodynamics.  It holds true for virtually every human being that has ever lived, and you are no exception.<br>  <br>  Want to eat whatever you want, fine...go ahead.  But when you are done with your meal, go to the gym and burn at least as many calories as you just ate.  After a while, you will realize that it is better to eat more moderately, while combining that notion with an effective wordout plan.<br>  <br>    Don't know where to begin in the gym? Hire a personal trainer.  He or she will customize a workout and nutrition plan that will allow you to finally be the person you want to be...as long as you are willing to put forth the effort.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me?  Try it for two weeks, and you WILL feel so much better that you won't want to ever stop.  Change your lifestyle...pick up a sport like tennis.  This life is not a dress rehearsal.  If you don't like the character you are playing, YOU CAN CHANGE IT!!<br>  <br>  Do it!  You will love yourself.|`|dDTjpU3Baa	you are beautifull and loved. THE INSIDE counts your soul  is your beauty, your kindness is your charm. Be yourself ,be full of good spirituality. You inner beauty will reflect itsself on your face, on your smile Fat is just a word. We are ppl  we`are human beings. I prefere someone fat to a sick skinny nail  (sort of speak) too skinny ppl have wrinkles   This society is sick !  Who decide? Who says?   Look at movie stars  getting depressed   so worried about being skinny ,they make themselves sick.   GO ON GIRL!   You are beautifull loved and most of all you are SEXY.|`|Ym5jzEa8aa	I may be echoing what the other have said, but you don't have to be "thin" to be happy. You are basing your appearance off of others, and that is never a good thing to do, no matter what size you are. And first of all, size is only a number, weight is only a number; that is important to accepting yourself as you are.<br>  <br>  As for 'fixing' it, it doesn't have to be major. Cover your food groups, just eat healthy, and I guarantee you will feel better about yourself, just by making little changes. For instance, substitute one meal a day for a salad, you can add some chicken or something, doesn't have to be a lettuce leaf and a glass of water :) and keep the snacks on the healthier side too. 100 calorie packs are great for satisfying cravings and not going overboard. and drink water, avoid sugary soda (too often) and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  As for exercise, make sure you get some cardio in a few times a week. Doesn't have to be too intense, just take the dog for a walk, or just go on a walk yourself. It will be a great stress reliever, and it makes you feel healthier just doing it.<br>  <br>  Now, I know a lot of heavier people also have issues with feeling like they have to wear frumpy clothes too, because they're holding out on buying cute ones until they get 'skinny' but that's not necessary. Dress the body you have, not the one you want. Buy clothes that suit your shape and play up your best features. If you like your eyes, try and bring them out with the colors you buy, and wear things that FIT, not things that hang 12" from your body.<br>  <br>  But the biggest transformation that needs to be made is a psychological one. It is important to love yourself. You say that you don't feel beautiful, but you ARE. I haven't seen you, and I know you are, because everyone is in some way. Just look at yourself and learn to love yourself, and people will love that about you. I am sure you have a beautiful personality that is being hidden by insecurity. Don't let the physical 'setbacks' keep the world from seeing how beautiful you can be-- inside and out.

hSOEgpPNaa	Yes, squats will help you a lot.  Just don't try to lift too much weight too fast, or you may get injured.  Practice your form with light weights until you have it down.  When you can do 45 on each side, go for more reps.  I got up to 81 reps without stopping.  Squats will help your butt get toned and rounder too.  I know a girl who calls me "sexy butt".  he he|`|jHUksr5Daa	in fact your legs will get in better shape! you just have to eat healthy . they wont start getting bigger with muscle until you exercise daily or so..so keep up the good work and you will have sexy legs and a toned butt.

nhfzZjrHaa	Water is transported through the blood. That's why when you drink water in excess it can asphyxiate you cells (becuase the concentration of solutes in the blood affects osmosis). The kidneys filter your blood and remove excess water as well. The toxens and water then travel to the bladder.
qnDk8xjPaa	I never really had acne at all but I was on Loestrin for 2 years.  It made me not get a period at ALL....until a few months ago I think because I gained some weight and had a higher body fat (didn't gain weight due to the pill obviously, I was on it two years) But I had no side effects or anything with Loestrin 24.  No weight gain, no boob change, no change in my skin.

AA11879371	Here is a site that helps you to determine if it is a pinched nerve:   <a href="http://www.highlandchiro.com/Pinched_nerve.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.highlandchiro.com/Pinched_ner...</a>   From what you say it may possibly be a pinched nerve.<br>  <br>  Here is a site that suggests some things you can do to alleviate some of the pain:   <a href="http://www.docflash.com/neck.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.docflash.com/neck.html</a><br>  <br>  You can take an anti-inflammatory pain medicine, like Advil, Nuprin, and Motrin (ibuprofen) or Aleve (naproxen).  Just not all of them at once!  Don't mix them either!<br>  <br>  You might even want to go to a chiropractor.<br>  <br>  Hope some of these suggestions help.  I fell down a flight of stairs and pinched a nerve in my neck and all the doctor did (after the x-ray showed nothing cracked or broken) was give me a prescription for naproxen.|`|hI0ZWBycaa	If you don't know what your doing, then don't chance hurting yourself more. If it's been longer than a week and your still in pain you might want to take yourself to a walk-in clinic. Might be more than a pinched nerve. Did your teacher examine it? I think usually with pinched nerves they recommend taking ibuprofen or aleve. Try a ice pack or hot pack. You can buy thermacare heat pads for your neck/shoulders from walmart and they are less than $5.00 and do wonders! And you can sleep with them on. Sorry I don't have an answer for how to unpinch but don't want to risk causing yourself more pain or more damage. Best to have it evaluated from a professional.

NE7t2oLYaa	Called arch pain:<br>  The major cause of arch pain is plantar fascitis (inflammation of the muscle that runs along the bottom of the foot). Plantar fascitis is caused by excessive stretching of the plantar fascia, usually due to over-pronation (flat feet).The inflammation caused by the plantar fascia being stretched away from the heel, often leads to pain in the heel and arch areas.<br>  <br>  <br>  treatment:<br>  Purchase high quality insoles to take pressure and pain away from the arch. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope This Helped alittle|`|hI0ZWBycaa	You have little tiny muscles in your feet/toes. If one of those is injured, or even if you stepped wrong on your foot/ankle, then it can cause that sensation. I don't have the proper medical terminology for what it's called. It's just an uncomfortable pain. I would recommend trying Icy hot. If you do this, put icy hot on BOTH of your feet, cake them up real good with the stuff, and cover your feet with socks. It helps your feet absorb the medicine faster. Should give you some temporary relief. Hope that helped.

NVxGp317aa	Yea unfortunatly its normal. Haveing a cast on as long as you have your muscles have weakned or atrophied from not being used. Once you start putting any weight or try and movement your working the muscles that haven't been used in months now. Kind of think how you feel after doing sit ups for the first time and your abs hurt but it gets less sore over time.<br>  I wish I could say that its not going to hurt or be sore for long but I am sure you have physical therapy in your future and its going to be sore for awhile till you get the strength back. When you start moveing it and start therapy do as many of your exercises in water to start off it feels better and the resistence helps with the strength.<br>  Good luck take tylenol or advil as needed and make sure you elevate it again as you start useing the leg its gonna start swelling again and the pressure can be uncomfortable.|`|AA11231884	if your bone is broken, then you probably have some injured muscles as well. that is probably why your sore whenever you walk. since you haven't done much exercise, it is normal unless its the other leg. but i hope you get well and will be able to start playing soccer again.

JtPu0KBXaa	Glutamine is a naturally occurring substance found in many foods we eat everyday, such as meat, fish, beans, dairy. It slows the breakdown of muscle tissue for protein synthesis in your body, allowing you to build and maintain a muscular physique while keeping your daily caloric intake low to promote fat burning.<br>  <br>  In other words, it's good, in moderation. Mix in a teaspoon with a milkshake everyday.

3RcMN0Ukaa	I have astigmatism too and I switched to regular contacts also a couple months ago and my eyes got really worse. But I don't think it's because of the astigmatism. Wearing contacts in general makes your eyes worse than glasses.|`|U31gt85xaa	I am inclined to agree with the previous answer, you must remember that contact lenses cannot replace 100% the vision that spectacles give you.<br>  How about starting at the beginning again and having an eye test ?  This information will give the answer as to whether your sight has improved or declined.<br>  You do not say how old you are but from my experience, yes, my eyesight which included astigmatism did get worse until I reached a certain age, then it leveled out, and after that, it improved to where I am now. No, astigmatism never goes away so regular eye tests are important to control the problem.<br>  Good Luck, I hope all goes well on Wednesday.

AA11263103	I got my braces off just 3 weeks ago, and I brushed like you, But they put a treatment for the yellow to blend in.

But its only because of the metal that was on your teeth for so long. Talk with your dentist. When I got my braces off, my teeth looked like. But with my braces plan, after they got taken off the dentist whitened my teeth. See if that is in your plan. Oh and also it hurts more when they put them on then when they take them off. So for your question just remember the basics, brush and floss twice a day and after meals.|`|jORX45ngaa	when you get them off, i dont think your teeth will look majorly stained. itll probably be just a little, but not very noticeable. one way to make them disappear is brushing your teeth real good, andddd if you want and your parents will let you, you can get those white strips from walmart or something, and im pretty sure those would work. good luck!|`|hHUFzovjaa	I got mine off a week ago, and the squares aren't very noticeable. <br>  <br>  By the way, if your friends tell you it will hurt, they are trying to scare you.

I'm assuming that your main goal is to do push ups so i'll give you a plan.<br>  <br>  First of all do more push ups you have to do push ups. That the main way that you can get better is by doing push ups. Push helps your upper body strength tremendously. <br>  <br>  Do bicep curls and tricep curls. Try to start with `15 pounds.

I used to get periods that were so painful that I could not go to school for the first 2 days of every period.<br>  I went and got a pill which helps with reducing period pain and that helped a lot.<br>  <br>  Walking actually helps reduce pain too, I know it can be hard if it hurts so bad that you're in bed crying and all curled up, so maybe that's a bit better when you can actually get up.<br>  Get a hot water bottle and put it just above your pubic hair, not around your stomach. The warmth should help.<br>  Eating chocolate can also help, I don't know why, but I guess being distracted by taste and releasing endorphines can help.<br>  Lastly, try having a bath. I know it sounds yucky cause you're bleeding, but not much blood comes out when you're in the bath. Make it really warm and it will help a lot!<br>  <br>  Also, a trick my mum told me to reduce periods pains for next cycles is, never walk around barefoot or with really cold feet and don't go out to places and have your lower back exposed, because when you're cold and your kidneys get cold, this can actually hurt with period pain.<br>  So remember, wear socks all the time and wear long shirts so your back isn't exposed.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you consider the pill if you aren't on it.|`|c6uxzsnpaa	I'm not an adult yet but when i get my period i get angry that us girls are the only ones who have to deal with this stuff with the cramps and the blood and the bloating and the birthing and stuff, u know? <br>  Sometimes it hurts just so much that i just am just like, i don't have to put up with this!!!! its like it hurts soo bad and i just want to never have it again, i think of having it for at least like 40 more years so its annoying, but i know that when i grow up i want to have kids so I can't do that.

QevBVANtaa	Either would be a great choice. Carrots have hardly any calories and what you don't burn off by chewing them you definitely will in your workout. Same with the nuts.

ifIRySXpaa	There are certain things you should eat more of, but you should also eat More, period. Many believe that eating less, skipping meals and starving oneself will make them lose weight. Yes it will, but only for a certain amount of time before their bodies are dangerously low in nutrients and calories and fat (which are NOT evil), and many people hit a plateau where they can't lose weight and don't understand why - If you starve yourself, your body will try to protect you and hoard all the food you eat so it won't die of starvation. If you eat well and exercise a lot you may gain weight IN MUSCLE. You might be losing inches but gaining weight because muscle weighs more than fat. Don't pay too much attention to the scale. How do you FEEL?<br>  <br>  Make sure you eat a decent sized breakfast as it will get your metabolism going and it'll help you eat a more balanced and controlled diet through the rest of the day. Drink lots of water but not during meals. Eat Slowly and chew your food properly - if you're going to ingest it, make sure you do it properly as partially chewed food that's gobbled up isn't digested well. Eating three meals a day can make you feel quite hungry inbetween and can lead to eating 3 Big meals a day. Try eating more but smaller meals throughout the day and have snacks such as vegetables, hummus, fruits, homemade smoothies, and nuts. Cooking your own food is really important as it will give You control over what you're ingesting and you'll have a much better idea of what's in your food. Eating healthy and cooking your own food doesn't have to be bland and time consuming either!<br>  <br>  Beans are very nutritious and rice can be too, just make sure it's brown rice. As for other grains, while making sure they're whole grain (refined flours have their nutrients stripped from them), try out different types like oats, quinoa, millet etc. Try out hemp hearts/seeds, they're super nutritious and by eating just a small handful of them raw as breakfast (great for when you're rushed) you'll feel energetic and satisfied and won't be hungry for a long time. My husband says this and loves them, they have a wonderful nutty flavor and you can add/sprinkle them on to anything. Fruits make wonderful snacks. If you had to choose between fat-free strawberry yogurt and 2% plain yogurt, which would you go for? While the 2% might have more fat, it's not loaded with sweeteners and modified ingredients and unpronounceable combinations of letters. Make your own fruit yogurt! Just mash some fruits or blend and stir it in your yogurt. If you want, you can top it with quick oats and a drizzle of honey. What do you mean by "good cereal"? It's easy to make your own tasty granola or oatmeal (oat bran, quick rolled oats, a couple pinches of salt, minced fruit, pour hot water on top and voila! Chemical, sweetener free oatmeal in less than 5 minutes!) Your body will get used to eating healthy after your tastebuds can calm down from all the crap found in processed "foods".<br>  <br>  Vegetables are the best way to go for nutrients and weight loss, they're very high in nutrients but low in calories and fats. The thing about veggies is that you can make them taste very different by cooking them differently - steaming, stir frying, exotic homemade dressings... You just have to experiment! It doesn't have to be the classic carrot and celery sticks with dip (and usually people use unhealthy dip...) <a href="http://whfoods.org" rel="nofollow">http://whfoods.org</a> is an excellent website about eating healthy; It has loads of information on the healthiest foods, along with nutrient charts and easy/quick/delicious recipes. There's also a "food advisor", it's a test that gives you an idea on what nutrients you might be low on and how to replenish them.<br>  <br>  But you have to see the bigger picture too - What is your food MADE of? Most foods found at grocery stores, gas stations, schools, you name it, are loaded with chemicals, sweeteners, sodium, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and most people are somehow ignorant to or unbothered by all of this, thinking that these ingredients in their "food" is normal and healthy. It's Not. Be careful of health claims that companies will make on their products, many of them are misleading. Be wary of the term " natural" as well. These days it's plastered on EVERYTHING, and on some products it's very ironic. When it comes to portions, don't feel like you need to eat the recommended serving size, it's a vague amount. If you could go with less, then by all means do so! Take some time to do research on the ingredients that you often find yourself eating, and listen to your body.<br>  <br>  By following these guidelines you won't need to restrict yourself so much and read fat and calorie content like the bible, you won't need supplements and the newest diet fads and pills (which ultimately don't work and are unhealthy for you).<br>  <br>  I've got a bunch of other tips on eating healthy on my blog <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/</a> as well as some recipes. By following these guidelines I've lost a lot of weight but I also feel and look good and energized, I find it easy to get up in the morning, my cravings and headaches are gone, and I enjoy lots of foods (vegetables mostly) that I used to hate.

However, you should see another doctor who will take your ailments seriously (perform tests).  You should also see a therapist (mental health).|`|IJh4zjKfaa	I'm sorry you have been suffering.  There may be any of a number of reasons why you are getting sick.  It may be your environment.  You should try an air filter in your bedroom.  It may be your diet.  You should avoid all unnatural and processed foods (like most snack foods and pop).  Stick to simple things like vegetables, fruits, simple grains like rice, and a little bit of different types of meat.  Get plenty of sleep (if you can).   It does sound like anxiety, but pills are not necessarily the answer.  Often they just mask the problem and do not address the root cause.  Of course, for some people they can be necessary in the short-term. <br>  <br>  Chinese medicine sees all problems as the body telling us that something is out of balance.   It is usually something in the areas of:diet, lifestyle, or attitudes.  I have written a book called "The Asian Diet: simple secrets for eating right, losing weight, and being well" (www.theasiandiet.com) which will be in bookstores in April 2009.  It describes the Chinese suggestions for adjusting the diet, lifestyle, and attitudes to bring you back into balance.  <br>  <br>  You may benefit from seeing an acupuncturist.  Acupuncture does not hurt, is very relaxing, improves the immune system, and gives patients a sense of calm and well-being.   Tai Chi is an internal as well as external martial art and improves both mental and physical health.<br>  <br>  It may also be helpful to speak to a social worker at your school or some other professional therapist to discuss your worries.

jE0Y9su5aa	Here are some tried and tested ways to get curves. No supplements, not pills, no diets, only ingredient necessary is some hard work and a desire for change!<br>  <br>  1. Do rapid body weight squats<br>  <br>  Body weight squats is extremely effective. Why? Because it helps tone your outter thighs. It might sound a little weird but trust me this flat out works. This exercise will definitely tone your outter thighs and buns. Here's how you do it. stand with feet shoulder width apart with knees slightly bent. Then squat up and down as fast as you can.<br>  <br>  Do this exercise, 4 times through for 20 reps every other day. Rest 1-2 minutes between each set.<br>  <br>  2. body weight wood chops<br>  <br>  This exercise is insanely effective against stubborn belly fat. It will tone your midsection faster than doing a zillion crunches. You'll notice a shrinkage in your waistline relatively quickly.  If there's ever been a "can't do without" exercise to a sexy waistline, than this one is it.<br>  <br>  This exercise is a must do because of the deep penetration involved with this dynamic movement. Here's how you do this exercise. It's really simple, think about chopping wood and then simulate the movement. yep, it's that easy. Do about 20 wood chops, 3 times through every other day. Rest 1-2 minutes between each set.<br>  <br>  3. side laterals with resistance bands<br>  <br>  This exercise will remove the flab from your arms completely and I am not joking. If done properly, you'll notice a more toned set of arms. It's really not hard at all to do. Simply stand on a single band with both ends being held by you. Now, lift the band up toward your<br>  <br>  sides until your arms are Parallel to the ground.<br>  <br>  This exercise will tone your arms and target your shoulders. You'll get more dept from your shoulders as you continue to do this exercise (No, you will not look like a guy). This is all about perception and illusion, Let me explain.<br>  <br>  when you get wider shoulders, you are creating an illusion. People will see your narrow waist and then your firm hips that curves in until it gets down to your thighs which then curves back out.<br>  <br>  You see it's all about the shape and illusions. Your midsection will look smaller than it is because of your shoulder and outer thighs. Do this exercise 3 times through, for about 8-12 repetitions. That's it, try doing these exercises regularly and I'm certain that you'll notice more curves in your body very quickly.|`|98yuFeekaa	Eat What you want like i could a soda or even <br>  a burger but do not exagerate and do some pilates <br>  you be a sexy curvyy girl|`|aHER8myJaa	you have to have a good amount of *** and thigh muscle in addition too some fat|`|FEStjFIRaa	YMCA!!!!!!lol<br>  dNT eaT aFteR siX|`|B7fS9hWOaa	Here subscribe to this guy.

AUOp1j5Saa	Some women just get cramps that are worse then others; however, it's unlikely that anyone will be sympathetic towards your case, even your doctor.<br>  Other women think they experience bad cramps when really there are certain women who simply get pain on a different level. <br>  You could have an ovarian cyst or a retroverted uterus both of which can cause extreme dysmenorrhea.<br>  I had to practically beg my GYN to give me an ultra sound because she insisted to me that I was just blowing my problem out of proportion.<br>  <br>  I experience something similar to you except instead of small bursts, it usually begins for me a few hours before I start bleeding and lasts until the third or fourth day when the bleeding subsides.<br>  <br>  It's not normal, although people will tell you it is, and it should be examined by the GYN as soon as possible. Be sure you press them on it and explain that you ARE NOT experiencing ordinary cramps.<br>  Like I said, by gyn would not believe me until an ultra sound and pelvic exam proved that my pains weren't being exaggerated.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	Talk to your doctor. my sister used to go through this until she had surgery to remove a mass just under her naval i beleive she had endometriosis.

Sarcomas commonly associated with limb cancer are soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma to mention a few.  Sarcomas can spread to other parts of the body and can be life threatening.  Primary tumors of bone and soft tissue (i.e. muscle, fat, and nerves) are extremely rare, and account for less than 1% of all types of cancer. There are approximately 6,000 cases of malignant bone and soft tissue tumors diagnosed every year in the United States. <br>  <br>  And BTW, there is heart cancer as well.  Cancer can strike any part of the body and organs.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	yes , it's called Liberalism|`|hWc65sEtaa	If you have cancer any where in the body, it's call cancer of that body part.  So, yeah there's cancer for every part of the body.

Most importantly, you have to eat healthy, and make sure your portion control is normal/small.|`|lkIcWsT3aa	No such thing, you will need to lose weight overall to lose your love handles.

Exv4AjqCaa	Starvation mode = made up nonsense.<br>  <br>  When people go on diets, their metabolism slows down after a while...meaning their bodys use the calories they do eat more efficiently = less hunger = results in slower fat loss etcetc unless they alter something again. Either eating less, eating normally for a bit to raise their metabolism up again...before going back on the diet, or simply getting more exercise.<br>  <br>  In your situation clearly you cannot eat any less, you're already eating to little. So just up the amount you eat gradually & also increase the level of exercise you get each week. You wont put on weight.<br>  <br>  At 900 cals a day you were probably losing muscle also anyway, its not entirely fat. Put it up to 1200 cals and you'll lose the same amount of fat with less muscle loss.|`|s0wBK9eYaa	I don't think that was a smart idea because if you cut your calories so significantly your body will want to hold on to all the food you put into it thinking it might be going through a famine or something. I would NOT counting your calories but eat until your 80% full. Your body will tell you how many calories you need but for sure don't go under 1,200! I would say that you haven't actually lost much fat weight but mostly water. Losing fat takes more time than just a couple of weeks. I would try to avoid carbs in the forms of sugar, flour, and other processed foods. I'd also recommend trying to add coconut oil to your diet. To learn more read Eat Fat to Lose Fat.
Km6QTk9Caa	Nothing wrong,  you just need to slooooooow down.   If you like it rough,  you may have got a bit sore or something.  Your BF may have been too rough even with his hand.<br>  <br>  Also,  please do not believe the BS about precum,  you are playing very dangerously.   If a penis enters you,  you are risking pregnancy.  Without a condom,  the risk is super high.  With a condom,  less risk.<br>  The "withdrawal method" is not very reliable.  Very risky.  And that is what you and your bf are doing.  If you weren't sure.   The withdrawal method is when the male withdraws his penis prior to climaxing.  <br>  <br>  Be safe. Use protection.    Be more gentle,  take time.   Enjoy sensations.  Relax.   Be plenty lubed up.  Soreness can happen if not enough secretions are present.   Friction.<br>  <br>  Do not ever use vaseline or any petroleum based gel.    It causes condoms to perish,  split.   You gotta use the right lubricant like KY gel.    It helps when you use condoms.<br>  <br>  Ignore the snotty,  mean comments.    Just respect yourself and be careful.    Don't sleep around.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	nothing you have to learn what you like and if he is too rough them tell him or show him. and no one knows when precum is coming out it can be any time so unless you are prepared for the consequences make sure you take every precaution, pills and condoms

QU5pmitQaa	If your 5'11'' and 155 lbs, then that means that you basically have the genetics for a body like Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee's weight fluctuated around 125-140 and his height was only 5'7''. When I say genetics, I mean, in a nutshell, that there are people who basically are big boned and no matter how hard they try they will never get a Bruce Lee physique. <br>  <br>  You should train every day and eat lot's of protein, but get that protein from Tofu. If you want Lee's body, you should also follow his diet. Do the same exercise routine everyday, keeping in mind that the slower the rep, the more definition you will achieve. Check out this book:<br>  "Bruce Lee : The Art of Expressing the Human Body". It was compiled and edited by John Little. The ISBN is 0-8048-3129-7.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your endeavors<br>  <br>  (By the way, it is controversially known that Bruce Lee did do steroids, but only for a short time)|`|cWgfavyTaa	the first two people are complete morons who have NO idea what there talking about<br>  well for you<br>  alls you gotta do is not eat that much eat like 3000 calories a day <br>  <br>  food=muscle mass<br>  of course then you got sleep and your lifting of course<br>  if you dont eat but have an amazin routine, youll get stronger<br>  but you wont get bigger or if you dont sleep<br>  youll get nowhere in your training<br>  plus you dont have much going for you as it is<br>  your skinny as hell already your not going to add mass easy for **** your not going to be 200 pounds in a month<br>  or hell even a year<br>  itd take you around 4 years<br>  your chances of becoming anywhere near hulk hogan is about 20%<br>  <br>  alls you gotta do is lift and dont eat that much<br>  3k for a guy who has a high metabolism is decent|`|2UOpbWqlaa	work out using only the weight of your body.  weight lifting adds mass like hogan.  rigorously exercising your body using only your body weight (and lots of repetitions) will define your physique without adding much mass like lee.|`|Jxx30d5Raa	Simple, do not take anabolic steroids.

She's absolutely correct.<br>  <br>  Edit: llewis is wrong. Bruce Lee lifted weights. He's actually one of the first martial artists who advocated weight lifting as part of a martial arts training routine.|`|J6O66K7Gaa	Most of that is genetic. Bruce could never bulk to be like Hulk. Even with steroids. It just can't happen. <br>  <br>  Within your genetic range there are many options. <br>  <br>  Not all big guys are stiff. Look at some of the UFC heavy weights: some 260 lb guys don't move so well and some are quick and flexible like gymnastic champs. Its all about how you train and your stretches.<br>  <br>  155 at 5'11" implies that you are of slighter build. Just workout. Getting stronger and ripped takes effort. It will hurt.

uWQ0oHTwaa	No, you probably shouldn't go to school tomorrow. Your temperature is supposed to be around 98.5 or 98.0 would be the most accurate. And you probably shouldn't go to school because, you may cause other people to have all these symptoms and that wouldn't be good. You should really get some rest. If your temperature is different in the morning, such as better, you still shouldn't go to school because your body would still be to weak to operate and you might become sick again and it will make you very tired and out of energy. So what I am saying is, don't go to school.<br>  I really hope you get better!<br>  -Katy<br>  P.S: To make you feel better drink plenty of liquids such as water or orange juice.

At this point I had been with my fiance for 4 years and love him like crazy. I live in England and he was in New York when I was diagnosed on a work placement. I really didn't want him to watch me suffer so I broke up with him without telling him the true reason. I wanted him to move on and find someone that he could happily spend the rest of his live with. When we broke up he dropped everything and came back to England and new that something was seriously wrong because at this point I looked very ill. He found out what was wrong in the end, as he was persistent and wouldn't take no for an answer. Since then, he has been so supportive through all my treatment and he had been my rock. <br>  <br>  I can understand why your cousin may not want to date because she's aware of the effect it will have emotionally on the other person. My fiance is encouraging and makes me laugh all day long and gives me the motivation to keep fighting - but it breaks my heart when I hear him crying in the night after he thinks I have fallen asleep.<br>  <br>  A cancer diagnosis is tough for everybody - not just the person diagnosed and it can be testing times for any relationship.<br>  <br>  I now know that I was silly to have blocked my fiance out in the early days, and now try to cherish every moment with him.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your cousin the very best.

Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com...</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.  I lose 30 pounds in two months.|`|f06aacf8002deeba6f9f116a6498bea2aa	Don't target losing more than about 2 lbs per week. If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.

VawQJREMaa	slow down<br>  not only does it prevent swinging, you also build more muscle, <br>  u wont be able to do as many,, but try to stick to about a 4-5 second chin up|`|t8kykME3aa	Don't cross your legs. Use a controlled motion. Pull yourself up fast without swinging. Use only the back muscles as much as possible. Go down slowly, controlled to prevent swinging. Going down is the part where most people drop and lose control on the movement. When you are tired instead of kicking for getting one more rep up it is better if you stop.

Eg1G2mvVaa	You need to ignore those height/weight charts and go by what size you are.  Some people weigh more or less than others and they can do more harm than good.  I am 5'7" and when I was your weight some of my friends could get their hands all the way around my waist, my bones stuck out and people thought I was anorexic (I was just naturally skinny in my teens).  I am now classed as overweight according to those charts, but the doctor says I am healthy, I am an extreme case, but it does show that you can only really judge by size.  You may be better off judging by clothes size, as you are average height then anything between a size 8-12 should guarantee you are not overweight.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	I don't think you're fat... but if you do want to loose some weight, try exercise.|`|kif21UOdaa	Body Mass Indicator (or BMI) is commonly used to determine whether or not you are in healthy weight range, although it's not always conclusive, especially for those under the age of 18. When you enter your weight and height into the website I'm listed (and there are many websites available that will calculate your BMI for you), it says that you are in the upper normal weight range. This generally means that perhaps you need to not eat that extra ice-cream every day and maybe get outside and do some exercise a little bit more. Weight observance can be an important thing for a 12 year old, especially when there are other changes going on in your body.

Depending on the amount of alcohol consumption and length of time you have used this amount. Acute Withdrawal can be life threatening.

Post Acute Withdrawal can last up to two years, with differing symptoms, a list of which can be found on both Yahoo and Wikipedia.  If you think you have a problem with alcohol contact Alcoholics Anonymous. I have been in recovery for about 4 months  <br>  and have no more acute withdrawal symptoms, but am still <br>  experiencing some memory problems and had to seek professional help for depression which I had most of my life and which contributed to my substance abuse issues!

Q4ggnG0waa	Just got done with mine a couple months ago. If it's radiation to the head, they mold a plastic mask to your face. It has little holes all over it and a brace to screw it down on the table. You can't move when they're giving you radiation because it has to go into a certain area of your brain. It's like a major xray.It took me all of 5 minutes for my radiation treatment.  Chemo is not given at the same time, but many times, on the same day.  Mine is a pill. If you have different cancer other than brain, many times they'll give you chemo through an iv or even a shot.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	read the difference of chemotherapy and radiation here<br>  <a href="http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/treatment-for-cancer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/trea...</a>|`|afz2ZPJPaa	When I had irradiation therapy, the only thing to be covered was my lungs.

Rob|`|mWaNEiixaa	I hate that too -  I always eat at night.  Hot tea fills me up - its hot - it kinda feels like food.  I would stay away from food at least two hours before going to sleep.|`|FgnAb0Ldaa	eat an apple or some kind of fruit.

XEk4fTixaa	I'm not certain if you have iTunes or not but if you do, there's a program called couch to 5k download it and walk with it, it can literally take you from a couch potato to being able to run within about 8 weeks.  You can also 'google' it and find how the regimine works, I strongly recommend it!  I loved it before I blew out my knee (again) and can't run anymore :-(
FyAHNpQbaa	you want a little bit of muscle. if you lose fat and don't have any muscle, you'll look sickly. i'm not saying to look like a body builder. but having a little bit of muscle will help you look lean and healthy.<br>  yes, muscle weighs more than fat, but when you replace fat with muscle, you look like you've lost weight. and also, muscles help you burn fat more quickly.<br>  it's best not to go by what the scale says, but by how you look and how your clothes fit.<br>  <br>  would you rather be skinny and weak, or thin and healthy and strong?|`|yrx6GxDcaa	you can lift weights. You want to just tone your muscles by using light weight and do more reps plus this will burn the calories. What ever muscle group you are working use the lightest weight that gives you very little resistance do 3 or 4 reps on each muscle group. Doing it this way you can work out every day you are not building the muscle mass you are toning the muscles and burning calories. I use to be a body builder in my younger days i have always lifted weights but for the last 8 years all i do is keep them toned using the method i told you about. If you are wanting to tone a certain part of your body then do like above but do 6 reps of 10 are 15  wait 15 seconds between each rep. I am 52 6ft. 2 in. and still have good firm muscles have weighed 235 for the last 20 years. I am not trying to lose weight and do not worry about what i eat as you do so you will lose the weight and not gain any bulk or large muscle mass.|`|eO5sddfLaa	probably<br>  but you wont like show it on your body<br>  in fact toning up your body will probably make you look even better<br>  but the number means nothing really as long as you feel and look the way you want to<br>  so put down the scale<br>  and just do it<br>  exercise is good for yo<br>  and if you find the results are not what you wanted you can always just stop|`|I38WF5aFaa	The exercises you are describing will not cause you to gain any significant weight.  It will increase your strength,  endurance and muscle tone. If you  are only using your own body weight for resistance you will burn more fat than anything else.  Running and aerobics are especially helpful for losing weight.  Just look at any marathon runner.  They all look anorexic even though they eat 6,000 calories a day.|`|0T769lIuaa	well,as long as you dont get hulk arms and stuff i think you will be okay, but muscle weighs more that fat...and it burns fat. and you need fat to make muscle...so ya. muscle is healthy, and sometimes it looks good...so i think you should aim for being healthy not "105 lbs"
61vLP1M0aa	Perfect for indoor exercises activities...calves and leg tendons need to do some stretches then the ballerina pose of getting up on your toes..brace against a wall or doorway..hold for 30 secs..repeat in sets of 5 to ten and rest...<br>  Forearms..tennis ball crushing while watching TV or sitting on the porch...could get some of those forearms exercising aids... again repetitive sets and rest as you go.<br>  You should not try to hurt yourself but get gradually aggressive then soon enough you'll be doing the military favorites of pull-ups, push-ups and carrying heavy loads.<br>  Be careful...best of health.|`|l9SYaK4zaa	not sure about the calves, but to get the defining look in your arms the 8 lb weights are perfect. You should start with the weights in each hand with your arms straight to your side . Then simultaneously lift both of your arms straight out without bending ur elbows do this as many times as you can to define your arms you can also "twist" your hands with the weights in your hands to get a more toned forearm as you lift the weights out.

Ask her if you another family member or loved one were to get hiv from someone without having been told about their status beforehand how would she feel, lets hope that this will do the trick good luck and god bless|`|JR96pECgaa	Tell her its illegal to have sex with someone and telling them you are not HIV positive and tell her to be open to you so you can give her some advice cause it is deadly for someone to find out they have aids and she needs to tell everyone that she gets close with and before it gets to the point that she gets in the bed with someone.|`|emFFifT8aa	To the above poster why the hell should this girl only consider people with HIV?! That's just silly. She is only dating and she is entitled to withold this information from her dates as long as she doesn't sleep with them. Put yourself in her shoes and imagine how you would feel... I am sure that it must be hard to broach the subject. She knows not to sleep with someone without telling them and I'm sure she won't. And the fact that she is dating this guy shows she must have feelings for him so shes hardly going to deliberately pass it on! Im not an expert on HIV but I'm pretty sure she cant pass on the virus if she uses a condom. In which case she can do as she pleases.<br>  I would just have a chat with her and say although you understand how hard it must be to tell him that she needs to tell him before they sleep together and ensure they use condoms correctly. But at the end of the day what she does is her choice... and im sure she'll make the right one.<br>  I hope she's very happy and gets far enough in this relationship to trust him enough to tell him.|`|Hhifw93laa	Ok well your sister is now 21 she knows she is HIV positive and she still continues to date You as a big sister can only remind her and pray for her because no matter how hard you try she is gunna have her own opinion and you will never be able to make decisions for her she is stubborn right now and might be a little revengeful you need to help her find classes she can go to for this it will help the both of you but she needs to find out what she is doing to those men and potentially a lot of other woman. there are men out there that are not gay that have HIV and would love a real relationship she just needs to stop thinking of her self and of other people this is a hard road to go down for the both of you please keep God close to you and continue to pray for your sister I will pray for your sister and you Im sorry I could not give anymore advice<br>  <br>  God Bless <br>  may you and your family find peace with your sister may your sister find peace through her disease|`|gSo4dR7oaa	If you know you have HIV, it is against the law to have unprotected sex with someone without first telling them you have HIV.  Your sister could be prosecuted for attempted murder if she has sex with people without telling them she is HIV+.   In some places, it does not matter if the person gets infected or not, just the fact that the HIV+ partner put them at risk would be enough to charge them.<br>  <br>  As an answer above states, however, your sister can date whoever she wants, with no legal consequences.  The issue of legal consequences would only apply if your sister would ever have sex with someone without telling them about her infection.|`|kT4kibqnaa	OMG yeah she should tell him or she could get in big trouble.<br>  <br>  It is so sad that she is so young and is HIV positive.|`|Df3gXIykaa	that it is actually against the law to not tell her partner. and she could get in serious trouble!|`|ihIAqEdWaa	People, You are missing the point here!  There's absolutely nothing wrong with her dating someone even if is not HIV positive like she is.  We are not in her shoes to judge her and jump into our own selfish conclusions about who she must and must not date. Who are we to tell who people should love really?  It is her life, she knows better to eventually disclose.  Imagine having to tell every single person that you are HIV positive right away? You'll never go out on dates in your life!  If the guy is right for her, when they have sex she'll tell him, it is her choice and with choices come responsibilities such as disclosing your status to any potential new partners, If she doesn't then is on her, but we're in no position to judge her without even knowing her circumstances.  She might be using condoms and as far as I know, If you use them correctly she can not pass the virus.  I have work with HIV positive people since 1997 and I known many people that have HIV. Just remember that she is also a human and that once like many of us, trusted someone that end up giving her the virus or perhaps she was careless but regardless, it was her choice.|`|wwwiWaK8aa	Laws relating to disclosure varies from State to State, country to country. it is not international as the answer above suggests.<br>  Find out about it where you are living and use this as a basis for a dicussion with her. If there is no legal ways to stop her from dating, you need to find a way to make her see how harmful this can turn out. But also you need to recognise that this is her decision and not yours.<br>  I understand your fear and it is justified, but she has to make this choice. :(<br>  <br>  read this it may give you some insight and info to help you talk to her about it, with facts rather than feelings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://focusonlivingwellwithhivaids.blogspot.com/2007/01/disclosing-your-hiv-status-to-others.html" rel="nofollow">http://focusonlivingwellwithhivaids.blog...</a>
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	The nurse either went through the vein or at least scraped it.  That causes the vein to bleed into the surrounding skin sometimes, and will leave you a bruise that is visible on the surface.  Ice packs help control that bleeding for the first day.  There's no particular reason your arm should throb, although if you are concentrating that hard on not moving it, you could be having muscle cramps from the tension of holding it in one position for a long time.  I think you might do best to relax and move the arm a little.  You can have something like Motrin for discomfort, but otherwise moving the arm is probably your best bet.  Body parts are meant to be moving ordinarily, and when we don't do that, we generally hear about it.  The joint isn't sprained, so the arm doesn't need rest.   It needs to move.|`|OZYsHbN0aa	Wow woman up deal with it|`|weDd8uuDaa	not really :( Bruises heal with time.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Elevate it above the level of your heart and keep the cold pack on it. You can take Ibuprofen for the pain.  You may still be bleeding into the tissues, so keep the arm immobile.  Don't take Aspirin which can promote more bleeding. By tomorrow, any bleeding should have stopped, and then you can use warm compresses on the bruise to encourage absorption of the blood out of the tissues.  This can happen if the needle tears the vein, or goes through it, and is not unusual..... it will heal, and you will be fine.

I wouldn't imagine it being more than 10 pounds, most of which would be water retention.
uZcHUvLpaa	O, not at all. All women have different cycles and number of days of bleeding. The normal cycle is 7 days. But it can be as short at 3-5 days and as long as 8-10.

U3tSMBXsaa	I agree. Both. Your muscles need protein before so that during the workout, your muscles get fuel.

KUIZrM0Yaa	First of all, remember that everyone loves a good listener. Try not to think about what you're going to say but instead concentrate hard on what the other person is saying, like there's going to be an exam on it. Practice a few remarks that will let the other person know you're interested and encourage them to keep talking. Try things like: <br>  "Really?"<br>  "Then what happened?"<br>  "What did you do?"<br>  "What did she say to that?"<br>  "Oh, that's fantastic!"<br>  "Oh, that's terrible!"<br>  Secondly, remember that just about everyone is more interested in themselves than they are in anyone else. Therefore, if you give them the opportunity to talk about themself to an eager listener, they'll think you're great to be with!|`|5V8yqwdWaa	I have the same problem.  But, I don't really try to think of something to say.  My mind just goes blank when people are talking to me.  Like sometimes in the middle of a sentence.  It sucks.  So, I usually just try to make a joke so everyone forgets what we were talking about.
TXtNdYqqaa	Hello John,<br>  I can't possibility know your answers to all your problems however I had almost the same experience when i went off a antidepressant drug (I was on it for a short 6 months after my father died). I do know the after effects are or can be as like you are describing! Do you think it is because your body has been used of this drug for 8 years as you indicated, or because you may need back on it? You may also need to be on a mild drug form on an everyday, for the rest of your life; You may have a chemical imbalance. Discuss this with a doctor, please as soon as possible.  John, there have been grey days where I too never thought I would see the light but trust me it will get better; This is the true reason I found Yahoo Q&A's almost 2 years ago....There are caring people out there, If at all I can help just by talking to you then feel free to contact me. Take care.|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Well it's hard to say, but if you've been on the Zoloft consisently for years, it's unlikely that it's what's causing the worst of these symptoms. I know only too well what you mean about being "way past depressed"; not that depression isn't awful (I was bipolar in high school), but feeling numb and detached is totally different. You're 21? I'm 22, and while it was depression that got me in the hospital in the first place (attempted suicide a little over a year ago), this new set of symptoms kicked in about a year ago now.<br>  <br>  Exactly what you're describing- numbness, the inability to feel, mixed with more "typical" depressive symptoms. I don't know if any of this sounds familiar to you too- emptiness, seeing things in black and white, expecting to die young (even if you have no immediate plans of suicide), and more than anything, self-destructive impulses. If this sounds familiar you should look into borderline personality disorder (what I have), or other personality disorders. There are several and they are quite different. They're often comorbid with mood disorders (depression or bipolar), eating disorders (yeah, this one applies more to the girls), and substance abuse.But not always.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't sound familiar, I think you should look up deporsonalization disorder. You're definitely depressed, seriously depressed; why haven't you tried another antidepressant? It usually takes several tries before you find the "right" one. And you may have something else too<br>  <br>  Tell me if you want to chat. Good luck|`|U3tSMBXsaa	Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your experiences as of late.<br>  <br>  Stop searching for answers is my advice. I mean, in my experience, the more I tried to find the answers, the more the other things in life lost meaning. You just need to shift your focus to something else.<br>  <br>  Start feeling happy! Start laughing! JUST DO IT. It's the least you could do. If you keep feeling happy, then you would have successfully tricked yourself that you ARE indeed happy. <br>  <br>  Come on, I believe in you!|`|U2LZDeKIaa	It certainly seems that you are in a depression. Maybe you should google Major Depressive Disorder. And you might need to try medication. If the depression has been going on for a while and it's not lifting on its own, if it seems to be getting worse, you really may want to give medication a try. What did your psychiatrists tell you? <br>  <br>  Definitely seek help. Going to a psychiatrist and a therapist regularly.|`|WJxN8ZeFaa	depression..get help, talk to a friend..trust me they can save your life<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309203243AAYXjQd">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  help me and a friend out by trying to answer that|`|J7EWQHYJaa	read the questions in the other links..<br>  <br>  You only have one life. Once it's taken away from you, there are no more chances to experience everything that this world has to offer. Even if there is a second life, no one knows for sure. So cherish what you have now, even if you can't feel much or are very depressed. In fact I've been depressed for the last 5 years because a sudden and major change came over me at the beginning of high school.. <br>  I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me but still haven't found the exact answer yet. But I'm not giving up because every day brings new hope. Even though most people seem to hate me and treat me like dirt I still continue and struggle every minute to survive. I want to show them and myself that I can be who I used to be.. and better. I want to end the injustice & discrimination in this world but of course I can't do it alone.. however if I can just make myself "normal" again but also keep my own thoughts and views about this world I can really change people's perceptions. <br>  I'm through with being depressed all the time.. I started to not feel anything too, maybe 2 years ago.. I stopped caring about everything and my grades went down. I started losing friends and shut myself off. I was always quiet but then I became like a mute person.. I just didn't talk at all for most of the day. I stopped eating properly and didn't take care of myself for years.. and ended up even worse than before.. and now I'm trying to get everything back and it'll definitely take years and years to recover but I'm not going to give up. And you shouldn't either. <br>  This problem is probably temporary, as everything else in life and life itself, so don't worry too much about it and try to go through every day with frequent smiles and do things you love to do, even if you don't feel the passion anymore. I also suggest that you go for a complete checkup, and try to find out if there are any side effects to the medication you've been taking.. or if this problem was caused when you stopped taking it.
1uSoU8Lpaa	Basically it's claim is to cleanse your body of toxins. Water alone is the best way to detox your body. Toxins enter the body in the foods you eat, liquids you drink, air you breathe. What the vitamin water is claiming to do is rid your body of these unwanted toxins and stimulate all your body's systems.<br>  Example: If you do not drink enough water, the body will dehydrate take water from your cells and burden your heart. Drinking water stimulates the liver, kidneys and digestive system and boosts your metabolism which then speeds up the elimination of toxins and fat. <br>  <br>  The vitamin water is claiming to do what water does naturally for you. Just be careful of sugar content in the vitamin water. Drinking at least 8 ounces of regular filtered water/day should to do the trick.|`|3692f162cff1ce2e85109e37c612ceb5aa	detox ?

If you didn't strain anything, take a hot bath anyway, it relaxes your muscles. Stretch after the bath and in the morning. The next day will be difficult, but after about 10 minutes, you'll loosen up and won't hurt nearly as badly. As you continue, you'll become more accustomed to the exercise and will not hurt as much, if any, after you are done. Your bum will get used to the seat as well.|`|Xc8jw1DZaa	next time you go before you go do your own warm up of at least 10 minuits and after make sure you streatch really well they may do it in class but you may need to do more on your own as well ! i know i need to do extra warm up and stretches additional to the ones done in class. rite now to lesson the pain and burning sensation take some panadole, have a hot shower and stretch those butt and leg muscles.

You might think they are expensive, but they're darn cheap. I mean the cheapest are only $15. That's pretty inexpensive. The online store I order from is www.optical4less.com All you need to do is follow the instructions they give you after you choose your lens. There's also a function which you can put your picture up and attach lenses to your picture and see how they look on you. Now I've been purchasing from this company for quite a while now, they are extremely reputable and trustworthy. Do give their site a check, www.optical4less.com|`|F0uLexezaa	you bring your prescription to the eye glass store, then pick out the frames you want and they will make your prescription for those glasses

WUVGFINnaa	every other day because working out damages your muscles so they need time to grow muscle in between also for faster recovery and building muscle faster get a protein powder i suggest Optimum nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey...the reason why you probably get mixed answers is because you can workout daily but cant workout what you did the day before for example you need to break each workout into parts one day will be Chest and Arms the next would be Legs and the next would be back, core and Abs...etc...Dont workout the same muscle two days in a row it stunts your muscle growing process check these workouts out also protein intake<br>  Mike Mentzer High Intensity training routines (AKA heavy duty).<br>  <br>  Here is a youtube clip of one of the routines. clip is kinda boring, but gets the point across<br>  <br>  Part 1<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcNwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcN...</a><br>  part 2<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv...</a><br>  part 3<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9ydQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9y...</a><br>  <br>  Now here is my whey protein schedule<br>  <br>  Right out of bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Immediately after workout 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Right before bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  <br>  Then sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night, I will go to the kitchen and have another 50 gram shake/smoothie.<br>  <br>  This blows up recovery and puts the mass on quick!|`|dZjkuw74aa	do it every day.<br>  there is no harm in it and it will help you more.<br>  or do more vigorous exercises every other day.<br>  depends on how hard you work.<br>  do push ups, pull ups, and run alot.<br>  also eat healthier and no fast foods.<br>  dont forget to stretch. <br>  and if you really want to get in good shape and you dont care to pay.<br>  look up P90X.<br>  its insane but you get great results.<br>  hope this helps.|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you workout everyday you need to target different muscle groups. Muscles need 24-48 hours to build and develop the training tears them down and rest builds. It would look like this:<br>  <br>  Monday chest, back abs<br>  Tuesday shoulders, arms abs<br>  Weds legs, abs<br>  Thurs chest, back, abs<br>  Friday shoulders, arms, abs<br>  Sat legs, abs<br>  <br>  You can do cardio everyday as well as abs, forearms and calves all other muscle groups need 24-48 hour recovery.<br>  <br>  To build do only 5-6 reps max with strict form and 3 sets all varied for example the bicep<br>  1 set 5-6 reps standing barbell curls<br>  1 set 5-6 reps preacher bench curls<br>  1 set 5-6 reps cable curls or dumb bell curls
htBHCNDtaa	Yes the wet feeling is normal. It just takes time for the pad to absorb the blood and if it's heavy it may constantly be coming out. Also, standing up and feeling it come out is normal too. It's because when you're sitting the hole becomes really tiny and when you stand up it's a bit bigger so whatever pooled up inside comes out quickly, lol.<br>  <br>  Try tampons. You can by some Tampax which have applicators and just try practiced. Whenever you're the most heaviest, try using one tampon with an applicator until you get it right. Don't use about 5 in one sitting, just use one tampon on the first time of every month until you've practiced so many times you can start to do it without the applicator.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay drier you could change your pad more often or use pads with a higher absorbency.<br>  The best way to feel dry is by using tampons. Sometimes some people try once or twice and master it, some other girls may take months until they finally feel comfortable enough with inserting it properly.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|poWztV24aa	It is totally normal to feel it, and to feel it more when you stand up. But pads are icky and there really isn't any way to feel drier unless you use those huge poofy ones which are just really uncomfortable. I suggest tampons, but if you're like scared of using them because they're associated with TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) or if you've never used them before, switch them out with tampons and pads until yo get used to them, and use the "light" kind. If you have a heavy flow, wear a pantyliner with the tampon.|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Yes!<br>  I have a heavy flow, and EVERYTIME I stand up, or even MOVE, I can feel the gush of blood, and it feels like it leaks everywhere(even though it really doesnt.) I'm still trying to get the hang of tampons, I've still never succesfully inserted one.<br>  <br>  I suggest trying tampoons, because you wont even FEEL the bloog, as its all stuck up inside you, and you dont feel the gush or wetness when you still down. :) Im excited to finally be able to use them, even though I cant yet, I'm excited for when I can.|`|KvOeZwWTaa	i feel it when i'm moving - use tampons they are great!!!|`|2E8IX9RCaa	that's completely normal i suggest wearing a tampon|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Usually, my pad has a few spots of blood in the morning and I change it. I put in a new one and at the end of the day it's filled with blood. If you keep getting wet I suggest switching more often. And tampons are pretty good with cleaning out your system. Just get a new one about every 4 hours otherwise it's just not good. Usually tampons catch that brown blood that comes out slower.|`|MwkR695Gaa	yes. its absolutaly unbearable. i suggest tampons they are life savers
4PdcTUCQaa	Do oblique situps.<br>  Diffrent ways to do them.  one is twisting while doing a situp, so the first situp as you're going up you turn your right elbow to your left knee and go back down, then when going up for the next one left elbow to right knee.<br>  Another way which is much harder but I noticed results within a week or two(got some definition and it brought out the 6-pack region's outline on the sides) is lay on your side, arms across your chest, feet ontop of each other and legs straight.  Pull your torso off the ground and into your legs/hips.  It's kind of difficult to explain/find pics of because I don't know exactly what it's called.  The closest thing I ca find is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXSmongOMdY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXSmongOM...</a> .either get someone to hold down your legs or put some weights on a couch and tuck your feet underneath(provided the space is big enough for both your feet sideways ontop of each other).<br>  Alot of people can only do like 5-10 of the first one but if you keep at it for a week you should be able to work yourself up to 30 of them in what will seem like no time.  It really tones it rather fast.
wDtA9hrhaa	Its harder than you think. Your going to end up binging from starvation. And you wont loose anyweight till like 3 weeks of starving and then your pretty much dead.

You said yourself your not fat.My friend has anerexia and now she cant have kids because it stopped her period and serverly screw her up|`|ftrGCdOGaa	Trust me. Been there. Actually I'm there right now. I have been thinking that. the worst that can happen is you get pretty hungry, right? Wrong. Not eating can cause dizzyness, weakness,anxiety, anger, clumsiness, saggy skin and one of the worst I think is losing hair. After a while you can simply brush your hand through your hair and the strands that you touch come out. If you decide to make yourself throw up anytime you eat something, this will cause your teeth to decay and basically disintigrate,  the enamel will wear off completely. I know its super hard to be struggling with your weight but that is the absolute worse thing you can do. If you don't believe me and you want all of this to happen then, I suppose you could fake an illness, say you'll eat later, say your stomach is upset something like that. But don't. Please, don't.|`|HbraP1cpaa	This is what hollywood does to you young teens. your too young to be depressed. ENJOY YOUR BODY NOW, You will miss it one day. Not eating isnt only going to make you MORE depressed, its not going to make you look healthy AT ALL. you'll have a sunken face, and MANY health issues to face in the future. If you absolutely have to lose weight, start with light excerise 30 minutes a day, and cut back on the calories. You not just going to lose weight by not eating...you will be suprised when you eat 3 meals a day, with 2 light snacks, and some excersize will do for you. Join the softball team, get a yoga DVD. Explore all healthy options. I would advise you to talk to your parents about this, they should get you into some counseling NOW.|`|s5y6SZhnaa	your parents will notice. mine did. <br>  <br>  don't stop eating alltogether.<br>  <br>  drink protein shakes to fill you up, so that you eat less.<br>  <br>  worked wonders on me.<br>  <br>  just run a LITTLE BIT.<br>  <br>  i was anorexic, too. its like it makes the color fade from behind your eyes and skin. a little lightbulb within you dims out completely.<br>  <br>  have common sense.<br>  <br>  oh and ps, your body will go into starvation mode after a couple days of doing this. all of the calories you intake, your body will automatically store as fat instead of processing them properly. anorexia is harder than it looks. <br>  <br>  a diet will work. you just arent doing them right. or maybe you are looking for a miracle that defies logic and science. which doesnt exist.|`|rgCWPPLmaa	I read your question and I wanted to cry because I was your age when I became anorexic and it nearly ruined my life.<br>  You don't want to believe it, but I promise you: you CAN be as skinny as you want. You CAN be super, super skinny, WITHOUT starving. <br>  Anorexia made me thin in the short term, but if you keep it up too long you end up sick in the hospital (or dead), or you fail, and end up gaining even more weight than before you started starving yourself.<br>  I am thin enough to model now and I did it without hurting my body, which means I can keep it up for the rest of my life! I have been super skinny for nearly a year and I eat beautiful food.<br>  Believe me when I tell you there's a better way. <br>  Let's say you choose to go ana. You'll get sucked into those pro-ana websites, you'll stare at thinspiration all day, you'll get obsessed, you'll lie to your parents, friends teachers, you'll feel excited when you start to lose weight, you'll hate food but you'll dream about it every night, you'll love the feeling of being empty but you'll hate yourself, deeply, for abusing your body and brainwashing yourself. The hunger will be your sick, twisted friend and your worst enemy. You'll love getting extra attention because you're wearing clothes you've always dreamed you'd look good in, and it gives you confidence, but you'll secretly be in HELL until you get better. No one is going to love you more because you lose weight. That boy you like is not going to fall for you just because your collarbone is sticking out.<br>  Actually, when I got too thin from starving, my bf left me. Not because he prefers curvy girls. He was definitely the type to like long, skinny legs and a tiny little tummy, and he didn't care much about boobs (which I barely have because I'm so thin now:(. But being sexy-skinny and being skinny from starving are two very different things. And, most of all, he left me because I was never his in the first place: I belonged to my eating disorder, and I couldn't connect with anyone because I was being eaten alive by it.<br>  You want to see the face of starvation? <br>  <a href="http://sheepoverboard.com/passingparade/img-mature/starving-child-4b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://sheepoverboard.com/passingparade/...</a><br>  Don't get sucked in. The models you idolize are, for the most part NATURALLY thin. They don't get that way by having a superhuman ability to abuse themselves forever. People who don't understand anything about the fashion industry will tell you that models are unhealthy and they're only thin because they smoke, do drugs etc. And I'm telling you, as a model, those cases are very rare. Some people are just naturally tall and skinny. <br>  For those of us who are not so lucky, yes, you can change your body, YES you can be just as skinny, but you're NOT going to get  and STAY there by being an anorexic nutcase.<br>  I hope you're a lot smarter than I was when I was in grade 9.<br>  I hope you're willing to admit to yourself that there are many ways to be gorgeous, and that big girls are out there having happy, full lives.<br>  I hope you realize soon that there's more to life than looking perfect.<br>  And I hope you realize that one day you're going to die. Do you really want to look back on your life, on your teen years, and see a miserable girl with an eating disorder who didn't let herself enjoy the sensuous, powerful, beautifying gift that food really is?<br>  Life is passing you by, don't waste it by trying to abuse yourself to reach a goal.<br>  There's a better way.

ZIz9C9OPaa	Simple Slimming<br>  You know the drill when it comes to losing weight -- take in fewer calories, burn more calories.<br>  1. Once a week, indulge in a high-calorie-tasting, but low-calorie, treat. This should help keep you from feeling deprived and binging on higher-calorie foods. For instance:<br>  <br>      * Lobster. Just 83 calories in 3 ounces.<br>  <br>      * Shrimp. Just 60 calories in 12 large.<br>  <br>      * Smoked salmon. Just 66 calories in two ounces. Sprinkle with capers for an even more elegant treat.<br>  <br>      * Whipped cream. Just 8 calories in one tablespoon. Drop a dollop over a bowl of fresh fruit for dessert.<br>  <br>        2. Treat high-calorie foods as jewels in the crown. Make a spoonful of ice cream the jewel and a bowl of fruit the crown. Cut down on the chips by pairing each bite with lots of chunky, filling fresh salsa, suggests Jeff Novick, director of nutrition at the Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa in Florida. Balance a little cheese with a lot of salad.<br>  <br>        3. After breakfast, make water your primary drink. At breakfast, go ahead and drink orange juice. But throughout the rest of the day, focus on water instead of juice or soda. The average American consumes an extra 245 calories a day from soft drinks. That's nearly 90,000 calories a year -- or 25 pounds! And research shows that despite the calories, sugary drinks don't trigger a sense of fullness the way that food does.<br>  <br>        4. Carry a palm-size notebook everywhere you go for one week. Write down every single morsel that enters your lips -- even water. Studies have found that people who maintain food diaries wind up eating about 15 percent less food than those who don't.<br>  <br>        5. Buy a pedometer, clip it to your belt, and aim for an extra 1,000 steps a day. On average, sedentary people take only 2,000 to 3,000 steps a day. Adding 2,000 steps will help you maintain your current weight and stop gaining weight; adding more than that will help you lose weight.<br>  <br>        6. Add 10 percent to the amount of daily calories you think you're eating, then adjust your eating habits accordingly. If you think you're consuming 1,700 calories a day and don't understand why you're not losing weight, add another 170 calories to your guesstimate. Chances are, the new number is more accurate.<br>  <br>        7. Eat five or six small meals or snacks a day instead of three large meals. A 1999 South African study found that when men ate parts of their morning meal at intervals over five hours, they consumed almost 30 percent fewer calories at lunch than when they ate a single breakfast. Other studies show that even if you eat the same number of calories distributed this way, your body releases less insulin, which keeps blood sugar steady and helps control hunger.<br>  <br>        8. Walk for 45 minutes a day. The reason we're suggesting 45 minutes instead of the typical 30 is that a Duke University study found that while 30 minutes of daily walking is enough to prevent weight gain in most relatively sedentary people, exercise beyond 30 minutes results in weight and fat loss. Burning an additional 300 calories a day with three miles of brisk walking (45 minutes should do it) could help you lose 30 pounds in a year without even changing how much you're eating.<br>  <br>        9. Find an online weight-loss buddy. A University of Vermont study found that online weight-loss buddies help you keep the weight off. The researchers followed volunteers for 18 months. Those assigned to an Internet-based weight maintenance program sustained their weight loss better than those who met face-to-face in a support group.<br>  <br>        10. Bring the color blue into your life more often. There's a good reason you won't see many fast-food restaurants decorated in blue: Believe it or not, the color blue functions as an appetite suppressant. So serve up dinner on blue plates, dress in blue while you eat, and cover your table with a blue tablecloth. Conversely, avoid red, yellow, and orange in your dining areas. Studies find they encourage eating.<br>  <br>        11. Clean your closet of the "fat" clothes. Once you've reached your target weight, throw out or give away every piece of clothing that doesn't fit. The idea of having to buy a whole new wardrobe if you gain the weight back will serve as a strong incentive to maintain your new figure.<br>  <br>        12. Downsize your dinner plates. Studies find that the less food put in front of you, the less food you'll eat. Conversely, the more food in front of you, the more you'll eat -- regardless of how hungry you are. So instead of using regular dinner plates that range these days from 10-14 inches (making them look forlornly empty if they're not heaped with food), serve your main course on salad plates (about 7-9 inches wide). The same goes for liquids. Instead of 16-ounce glasses and oversized coffee mugs, return to the old days of 8-ounce glasses and 6-ounce coffee cups.|`|lmHBKBxYaa	Eat less food. Move around more.

This is just a speculative article, if I remember correctly.  By no means is it at all true.<br>  <br>  However, scraping on healthy tooth enamel doesn't do a thing.  Your dentist knows what to do.<br>  <br>  Sealants are good for filling deep pits, and will generally keep cavities out of them.  however, dentists don't use them a lot, only when you have really deep teeth.  Some of my premolars are really deep, and I have had sealants since I was a kid on those.  I'm actually about to get them replaced/refurbished.<br>  <br>  But about your dentist: You should LOVE what your dentist does and feel TOTALLY COMFORTABLE with everything he offers/does.  If you feel like he is gold digging, find a new one immediately.  The dental profession should be a service-based industry, and If you feel you aren't getting the right service, you should go elsewhere.  Its a lot like taking your car to the mechanic in this way-- you have to trust him to find the problem and not tell you to do unnessesary things to your car or mouth!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you are peeing out blood, it sounds more like you might have a urinary tract infection, which needs a doctor's visit.  Your period's irregularity might simply be chance - a pause in periods is not uncommon - but either way, blood in your urine is a serious issue.  The pains you are feeling might be your kidneys rather than your ovaries, which would also be indicative of a UTI.<br>  <br>  If you also have any pain while urinating, or if you have to pee a lot, or if you feel like you still have to pee even once you have just finished, these are also symptoms of a UTI.  But it still needs a doctor's visit.  You can try talking to the school nurse about this, if you are uncomfortable explaining to your dad exactly what's going on.|`|IX4Sf8Azaa	This is serious.

Sprint triathlons include 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of running, for example, while Ironman (full) triathlons include a full 26.2 mile marathon. The biking and swimming distances vary a great deal, too, and there are certainly other triathlon combinations in-between.<br>  <br>  Most would probably consider a sprint triathlon "easier" than a full marathon, though one likely has a higher average exertion level on the shorter course while it lasts.<br>  <br>  Most would almost certainly consider an Ironman (full) triathlon harder than a full marathon, seeing as how a full marathon is just one-third the race.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it depends on what form of triathlon you're comparing the marathon to.

But please do get professional help.|`|Uh2vfl5Uaa	I think maybe you just need a good hobby.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Sounds like it. Because you have atypical depression (oversleeping instead of having insomnia) you should be screened for bipolar disorder. Often, hypomanias are not reported to the psychiatrist so they miss the diagnosis (the patient thinks that was a normal time) or often, the person has not had a manic period yet - the disorder has not advanced to that stage yet.  Antidepressants by themselves often make bipolar much worse, which is why you need to be screened.<br>  <br>  You need professional help. If you suspect bipolar, see a psychiatrist, since you will need meds. If you don't think it is bipolar (no history of it in the family, you read up on it, doesn't apply to you) and you have a lot of "issues" such as emotional or sexual abuse, perhaps you want to start with a therapist.  Generally, it is best to do both counseling and meds, but if you don't need meds, you can skip the side effects, then.<br>  <br>  You didn't ask for this, but I guess I will give you my depression tips, too. See if some of these will help take the edge off. Some specific tips for you - try to sleep one or two hours less - the more you sleep, the worse the depression will be. Force yourself out of bed.  If you feel the urge to cut, hold an ice cube, or put a rubber band around your wrist and snap it, insted.<br>  <br>  tips (print them out)<br>  If your depression is worse in winter, try to get more sun. You may have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or your depression could be partly seasonal. Use a light box (10,000 Lux (light intensity) at about 20” - about $300 online, don't get at a local store, they  charge more, you don't need full spectrum, it needs a UV filter).  I have extra windows, spend time in bright rooms, painted the walls peach & yellow & have a skylight ( it helps!!!!!)<br>  <br>  Try meditation like progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery.  It reduces stress, & depression. See The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook by Edmund Bourne for examples.  Free 15 minute guided imagery download at healthjourneys.com.<br>  <br>  *****  #1 MOST HELPFUL  Go out with friends, & if you don't have any, join a club & MAKE yourself go until you look forward to it. “Isolating” makes depression worse.  <br>  <br>  Exercise 1/2 hour a day, & anytime you feel depressed. Exercise is a great mood stabilizer & reduces anxiety.<br>  <br>  Insomnia?: Go to bed & get up the same time each day, even weekends. Don't use your bedroom to watch TV, read or use the computer. Don't do stuff that revs you up before bed, like exercising & using the computer. Light from computer screens & TV wakes you up.  Use that last hour to wind down-Take a bath? Make the bedroom very dark, even cover up the alarm clock. Use a noise machine (makes wave sounds etc.) to cover up disturbing sounds. Avoid caffeine in afternoon & evening. Try soundsleeping.com for free relaxing sounds downloads.<br>  <br>  Put a lot of colorful, happy things around the house & let the sun in. Do nice things for yourself.  Make a list of things that make you happy.  On my list:  bread fresh from the oven, the scent of Jergen's cherry almond lotion, the crisp sound of a saltine cracker breaking, fresh sheets on the bed, standing in the boat flicking topwater lures onto the water, etc. Use all your senses & read that list when you are breaking down<br>  <br>  Work on time management if you are overwhelmed. Cut back on other responsibilities so you can spend more restorative time with friends & family.  Ask for help if depression makes it hard to keep up with chores.<br>  <br>  You got a significant other?  Extra physical touch is helpful. Many  people are touch deprived, so hold hands more, hug more, give shoulder rubs, etc.  A pet is great if your home situation allows you to get one. (Don't if you can't commit to it for 15 years)  <br>  <br>  Do NOT listen to sad music! It makes things worse!  Listen to upbeat stuff- same with movies & novels. <br>  <br>  DISTRACT yourself when you are hurting.  Read a novel, watch a comedy, go out with friends, play cards, play  a video game, whatever is mentally all-consuming. This is a VERY helpful tip!!<br>  <br>  Volunteer. Research shows that helping others makes you feel better about yourself. It also keeps you more involved in the community.  Many people find comfort being involved in religion.  Get help from your pastor.<br>  <br>  For chronic & severe depression, go to mentalhealthrecovery.com & order a $10 WRAP (Wellness & Recovery Action Plan) booklet – it helps you write up your own daily plan to maintain mental health & a checklist for a crisis.  Consider filling out a psychiatric advance directive to protect your rights & inform professionals about your care if you have a crisis. Links to your state's free PAD can be found at bazelon.org. <br>  <br>  If suicidal, find a community hospital with an inpatient behavioral health unit (check yellow pages) & go or have someone take you. Don't call 911 unless you have already hurt yourself, because if it is just psych symptoms, it isn't an ambulance that comes, it is the police, & they will take you to the closest place & that could be a horrible state hospital.<br>  <br>   I have severe psychiatric symptoms from bipolar disorder & PTSD & these things help me (I haven't found any meds to help me yet).  *Also, research shows that both pills & counseling are more effective than either alone.*  Take your pills every day without forgetting.  If your symptoms don't improve within 3 weeks or so, call the doctor for a med adjustment.  Cognitive Behavioral therapy is the most effective kind of counseling. Try free computerized CBT at moodgym.anu.edu.au.  Computerized therapy appears to be almost as effective as counseling, research shows.|`|U3tSMBXsaa	As one movie would put it:<br>  <br>  "Quite feeling sorry yourself and put a smile on that face."<br>  <br>  The best remedy is to "trick" yourself that you're happy.

zecualttaa	There are many ways to get rid of pimples with out spending much money. I know personally that steaming your face helps unclog pores and establish a nice facial glow. You just boil water and let the steam hit it by putting a towel over your head and holding your head over the steam. Once you begin to sweat (10-15 minutes) wash your face with cold water to close the pores back up. You will see immediate results.<br>  <br>  Also drinking A LOT of water helps acne. You should notice improvements after a week of consuming large amounts of water.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regular peroxide will also dry up pimples and help them to heal and its cheap.|`|kbGjEeoLaa	I am 23 year old male, and I struggled with acne since I was a kid. What I found that works the best is to change your diet. For example, I used to drink nothing but Pepsi and now I don't. By not drinking soda anymore, its like night and day with my acne. Also, greasy foods tend to make me break out. Chocolate does it pretty bad for me so I limit this. Recap, try not drinking soda. If you already don't drink soda, look at other things you ingest. I was amazed with the difference not drinking soda made. It was hard not to drink soda, but it was worth it.|`|XKoVjG2kaa	hey , i think you should just wash your face everyday atleast twice popping them isnt a good idea because it will turn into scars i have  never had a pimmple even though im only 14 years old but if you keep you face clean everyday and non oily then your face would be naturally clean . maby once in a while it will be little pimples but dont worry about them they will go away using acne remover,proactive and other products for pimples and face reactions are not so good they take a really long time and its sometimes give your skin a rash expecally if you have soft sensittive skin .<br>   <br>  hope this helped=]|`|7X28owjxaa	Like the second answerer, leave them alone. Seriously, I used to always touch my pimples and only when I stopped the bad habit did I notice them begin to decrease in number. <br>  <br>  So don't touch them (it'll spread the bacteria and you'll get even more pimples), wash your face with a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil (it's around $7 at any drug store if you have some coins to spare... lol. Don't forget to wash with lukewarm water! and no more than twice a day, once in the morning and at night).<br>  <br>  Also drink plenty of water to flush toxins out. Hm, I notice that the more fruits and veggies I incorporate into my diet the better my skin and overall health is. Exercising more also helped make my skin glow. Whenever I stop exercising, or when I start eating junk food again, my pimples return full-force. <br>  <br>  Well, that's all I can give you... I hope you find something that works best for you.|`|mJaEsxwCaa	Usually if you just leave them be they will go away.

If you have any of the creams left over the best one I have found is Clearsil this will clear it in no time at all.<br>  <br>  You may have a food allergy which causes this condition in the first place.<br>  <br>  Practitioners of Naturopathy often recommend a short, supervised fast to cleanse the body of impurities. This is usually followed by a diet based mainly on fresh fruit and vegetables, and excluding sugar, fried and fatty foods, alcohol, and strong tea and coffee.|`|vPpy4zK9aa	Oh well, those things happen...

f06aacf8002deeba6f9f116a6498bea2aa	Don't target losing more than about 2 lbs per week. If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.|`|9025b6ac4856e7655881c6f1c8293986aa	Walking a long distance is actually better at burning calories, than jogging!<br>  <br>  Try weight lifting.<br>  Turn that fat in muscle!<br>  Preferably, leg muscle.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com...</a> <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://secreteverlossreview.blogspot.com...</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.

CciXZNYraa	Try these exercises;<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times. <br>  In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.|`|TVnpzBGQaa	I know a book called The Truth about Abs.

QD2AJv22aa	No, you wana gain a little bit of bulk.  Eat right, work out and youll b fine.  Fat isnt good.  Years of ice cream and pasta and little to no cardio put on the weight.  I assume you are not a big eater.  When you stuff yourself to the point of discomfert, you are most likely going to gain weight<br>  <br>  You want the best advice?<br>  Follow the food pyramid, look it up on google and then, start working out.  Do what they do in the army if you cant get to a gym or anything|`|YteiWSM1aa	The most effective way to burn fat is to eat less and move more, the issues appear when we actually attempt to put that into practice! There are loads of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The only diet which clearly showed results for me was green tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN.

j6kyAhQOaa	Your doctor will know best about whether or not there's a fracture or if the bone chip is causing your problem.<br>  <br>  Even if nothing is seriously wrong with it, it can take time to heal. I sprained my ankle about 2 years ago - it was a mild sprain that I could walk on even immediately after, it just hurt.  I was instructed to keep using it normally, just with a tensor bandage at first and with the usual icing. After a few months, it would still hurt a little bit when I walked on it for any length of time or if I ran. I didn't fully recover from the sprain until 10 months after I injured my ankle.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	maybe, just go get checked out and get the mri...and dont run again til you see him, you could be making it worse
XKhNw221aa	do what feels comfortable. there is no set number, just push till you can't do any more, then do ten more. so maybe four sets of 50 for pushups, then four sets of 100 for set ups. and start using free weights.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	While I served in the military we'd used to do well over 100 push ups a day.  I didn't keep track but what helped me was I knew that I can do roughly 100 in one session without rest.  (I knew because we got tested on how many we can do and I always maxed out around 100 or so)  So when I got pretty tired, I knew I was close to 100.  And sit ups we'd mixed it up.  I didn't really do all sit ups or all crunches, or side crunches.  We'd do a bunch of a variety.  So if you'd really wanted to count maybe we'd do a total of 300 or so?  <br>  <br>  My advice for you is this.  When you do push ups concentrate on your form more than how many you're doing.  Push yourself until it burns.  And if the next day you're sore, take that day off from doing push ups.  For sit ups, you should do as many as it takes for your abs to burn.  Again rest if it's sore but abs you can if you want to work out everyday if it's not too bad.  Also remember to stretch.  Good luck.|`|lmHBKBxYaa	The only answer anyone can give to a question like this is "More". Do as many pushups as you can until you're at your breaking point, then do more the next time, and even more the next. That's the only way to gain strength and muscle mass.|`|AA11481959	Do as many as you can.|`|klBuVAXIaa	however much you can handle.

If you go too low you'll put yourself a risk for a major health risk. Women need to have a higher percentage of body fat for child bearing reasons, since you're 15 years old it doesn't concern you much but it will you the future. It really depends on your diet. You need to cut out fats to lower your body fat. But you also need to rev up your metabolism with 5 to 6 small meals a day. Also you need to mix weight's with cardio. Resistance training is very good at droping fat because your muscles continue to burn calories after you stop working out. But remember, you need to eat!!! And take it easy on the workouts, too much can have a reverse effect on your body. Everything must be done in moderation. Also you must rest one day in between workouts. Remember though, there is much more to life than looking good.|`|6AV9XbjCaa	girls should not have DEFINED abs<br>  they look perfect the way they are<br>  and its probably in your head when you sit down<br>  im not trying to be mean or anything<br>  you're 15, you dont need to try so much =]|`|54bTmqipaa	Keep working out and correct dieting is very important also, but you are well on your way to getting to your goal.|`|X04FrI3Daa	Your 15 you shouldn't be worried about abs, and when you sit down your body scrunch together. By the way you look good, better than me (i just started working out). And your birth mark looks like a butterfly it's cute. My question is do you slouch? Maybe that's why you look fat when you sit. If you want to build abs, it's just the same as building any other muscle eat protein such as beans, nuts, and such. Cardio burns fat, but if your not careful it can burn muscles away make sure you heart rate stays under 170 (i think).  When you work out your muscle don't do it every day you will wear them out, and don't repeat the same king of crunches. I suggest you go to womenshealth.com or something like that. Stretch your body after that helps tone your muscle, that includes your abs.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Relax and breathe out, dear.  It's not likely HIV, it's been way too soon for anything noticeable to happen.  The lymph nodes can puff up for viral infections of all sorts, even when you don't otherwise feel sick.  If you recently had a cold, it could be due to that.  Lymph node swelling usually goes away all by itself within a month, and there is no need to do anything about it.  Just don't go squeezing on the thing, poking or prodding at it, because that will just irritate matters more and make is sore.  If it doesn't go back down in a few weeks, then just go see the doctor for a checkup.  As far as the original worry, if you are going to have sex you need to wear a condom.  HIV is just one worry, there are plenty of other things out there you do not want either.  Folks don't have warning signs on their foreheads, and the nicest folks in the world sometimes carry some very not nice diseases without even knowing it.  If you are really worried and want to settle the issue, go get tested at the nearest Planned Parenthood clinic or public health clinic.  And from now on, wear a condom- every single time.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	People can't just tell you online.  The only way to know is to get tested.

CSuMuWlcaa	If he didn't ejaculate - this includes precum (much clearer substance, that can sometimes contain sperm) -  and didn't even penetrate you, you're not pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't concern yourself with being a virgin or not.  The term means many different things to people.  Its such an arbitrary term - just know what being sexually active means to YOU, don't bother yourself with what anyone else thinks.<br>  <br>  Next time however, use a condom.  Always always always use a condom.  I don't know your age but if you're as unsure about sex as you seem to be, I would advise not engaging in any sort of sexual activity for now (this coming from a 16 year old male).  I know it sucks to have to talk to your parents about things of this nature but honestly, if you're planning to become sexually active you really should talk to them, or some other adult you can trust.|`|m2aznd8xaa	if there was no penetration your still a virgin however if he ejaculates right in your opening you can become pregnant. even a drop is enough for them to swim in you and get you pregs.|`|ZRgLHW3maa	yes you are still a virgin. to lose your virginity the penis must ENTER the vagina. and unless he came in you, then no you are not pregnant. don't worry|`|GApjwrnJaa	Being a "virgin" is different for everyone. I know that some people consider oral sex to be having sex and if you have oral sex, you're no longer a virgin. You decide for yourself where to draw the line. <br>  <br>  As for the pregnancy issue, any time the penis comes in contact with the vagina, there's a chance you could be pregnant. Considering he didn't orgasm or even go inside you, the chances are so slim i wouldn't even think about it.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Technically you lose your virginity when the penis penetrates you completely.

G0ljmbAvaa	You certainly can make your goal in that amount of time so that is the first thing down.  We all have very busy lives and it is hard to plan meals and healthy snacks in advance and quite frankly grabbing the first thing that's available to us is what landed most people in the situations they are in.  With that being said you really need to plan out your meals for work and put them in tupper ware dishes or brown paper bags and haul them with you.  Some people that do the "body for life" program take a small cooler with them every where they go so that they can eat 5-7 very tiny meals every 3 hours.  That might not work for you but should try to come up with a regular schedule that works for you and stick to it and prepare a few meals ahead of time.  <br>  <br>  It is very good that you are motivated to work out.  That is a huge advantage when it comes to losing weight.  You don't have to run but you certainly have to keep moving.  Elipticals are great.  Walking and hiking are great too.  If you have a gym membership try to take some of the fitness classes.  That will give you ideas that you have not thought about and they are very motivating.  It is good to try to do some resistance training as well.  Simple things such as push-ups on your knees will do wonderful things for your upper body.  Squats and lunges are miracle-makers for the lower body.  Going up and down stairs is another great idea.  Keep a journal and record your workouts and your calories and foods.  Try to weigh yourself weekly and be very consistant with the same day and time.  Drink lots of water and give yourself praise when you resist a temptation.  Work towards a daily goal and a weekly goal.  Aim for small results and above all keep your eye on the prize...a wonderfully healthy fit body before your wedding day.  Good luck.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	Weight training is supposed to burn fat and gain muscles. Have you tried that?<br>  At work, you should bring like a diet shake to drink when you have no time to eat.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It sounds like you could be retaining fluid in the morning and afternoon, which could cause some swelling and then eliminating the fluid in the evening and at night.  This could be a symptom of early pregnancy, but is also a classic symptom of diabetes, especially getting up at night to pee.  If you know someone that is a diabetic, like me, you could have them test your blood glucose for you.  They will know what the numbers should be and then you would have an idea about diabetes and maybe rule that out.  You could also take a hpt to rule out pregnancy.  That said, it is always best to consult a doctor if you have a new condition that you can't diagnose on your own.<br>  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	It could be a bladder infection.

mqXyDTwwaa	What are you looking for? Anything spammed on Yahoo Answers don't work. Especially acai berries ans wu yi tea. Alli works pretty good, but you have to stick to a fairly restrictive diet, and you have to worry about "treatment effects". An ECA stack works pretty good. ECA is Ephedrine, Caffeine, and Aspirin. Clenbuterol works really well, especially when stacked with t3/t4.|`|JoLzzkxbaa	I've had people tell me that Alli works amazing, and that you literally see the weight coming off, literally, unfortunately.

You'll lose weight AND be healthy! Best of luck to you!
LmAe3imOaa	it's called dribbling! lol. all it is is when you pee, ur pushing it out with the muscles you have, then it gets to a point where your muscles have done all the work they can to get all the pee out, so you let your penis relax and it dribbles, this is because there was still urine in the shaft, and when you relaxed, the extra urine just dribbled out. this happens to tons and tons of guys|`|TSzhgRy5aa	This happens to me sometimes too.

qrGLcTh4aa	No it won't heal itself.  If the tooth is indeed fractured you might be looking at a root canal and crown. You are already sensitive to cold which means that the tooth is irritated. That won't go away without intervention ( a root canal). <br>  You will also for sure need a crown due to the fact that the tooth is already fractured. You could break it simply through use. The crown would offer the coverage it needs to protect it for the rest of your life.<br>  So, if I were you I would see an Endodontist. That is a root canal specialist. They do root canals all day, they won't mislead you into work you don't need. They will know the proper treatment plan for you.|`|1nINGDC7aa	some times after sealing the tooth and using desenstizing tooth pasts help but if the condition persists then you have to go for the root canal treatment at the most. you need not to get paranoid as there is no need to get it extracted. for more information on root canal treatment you can visit the followng link<br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/articlesubcategories.aspx?articlecategoryid=17&name=root%20canal%20therapy" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/articlesubcate...</a>|`|xbyQAU4haa	Tell the dentist!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|4fGBkMG0aa	dude what the dentist says u little ****..

But you need foreplay. She needs to be wet. If she is not wet enough it could hurt her.  Enjoy the sex, play with her and find her "Spots" and Practice makes perfect but always practice safe sex.|`|m2aznd8xaa	lots of foreplay. all over from head to toes  learn about the womens vagina and where the trigger spots are.|`|U7dQYA6Raa	Just go down on her have fun with it.|`|QnYYXRkBaa	First of all, lots of foreplay. Make her want it. Go down on her, and take your time. Go slow, kissing and licking softly. When you get to penetration use your Tongue and finger(s). Another trick is to softyly place your lips over her clit and hum - it feels just like a vibrator. She'll love you for it.<br>  After all of that she'll be very sprung. So make love to her!!|`|0wHeVJ50aa	I usually get off when he goes down on me.|`|gPazTqzYaa	Eat Her UP!!! =]<br>  thats what i do to mines =]|`|Qs89zt9taa	OK... MAKE SURE THAT YOU COMPLEMENT HER!!!!!! Don't just ignore her. It would be curtious if you asked if she was ok every now and then just to make her feel like she still has some control of the situation. It is VERY different for we girls. We don't just feel it instantaneously like you guys do. So pay attention to her. Ask her questions like: where do I need to go, what do you want me to do. Do you prefer this or this. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ON TOP OR BOTTOM!!!!!!!!! Make her feel like, as I said, she has control of the situation. We both know, in all actuality, that she will basically be at your mercy. Obviously, your intent is to please her; which is VERY considerate of you! But make her feel like she is the one in control. (Her being on top might help that. You should want to limit her feeling nervous or anxious). On top she will have "control" and can move as she pleases and you can just lay back and enjoy the ride ;)  Make sure you keep conversation. Also, you need to talk to her about protection and pretty much go with what she wants. Another thing, kissing her passionately is a nice touch. I don't mean on her lips. Her neck and arms are a good place. Let her take her time and figure out what she likes.  <br>  <br>  Ok... I am kinda going to talk about my first time because i think it might help you. I know that it was both our first time. So, something to note: it was very quick. MOST men do not have very good control there first time. It really doesn't last longer than minutes if you are lucky. SO... if this is your first time, be aware of that. Because, as a girl, it is kinda: oh....you're done? Ok... - so make sure you ask her if she wants to go again. But I am sure you'll be fine on that. <br>  <br>  ***Just remember*** <br>  <br>  talk to her. ask her what she wants and try to be accommodating while you still have pleasure, too. Coming from experience (no pun intended) my boyfriend likes it better when i enjoy it more. SO... ask her what she wants. You don't have to keep a conversation going about the nat'l debt. Just talk enough to get a general idea. and let her take a little lead. you don't have to be a leader all the time. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZH0Sn6R0aa	You put your penis in her vagina.

One of the terms of service she added said you couldn't 'annoy'. She'd probably say you violated that rule.

Others she told they weren't tough enough and didn't want to lose weight bad enough - nice support coming from a 300+ pound diet 'expert' hiding behind a website!

PPesG2c9aa	The term overweight means different things to different people. It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and ascertain if you are in reality overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the one method which definitely delivered for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

RfxyVIh4aa	This is EXACTLY what I had.<br>  <br>  I didn't have to have a hysterectomy.  I had a procedure called cryoablation.  (I'm not sure if I spelled this correctly.)  Essentially, they frozen the lining off of my uterus.  I just had this done less than one month ago.  It was an out patient procedure.  I was pretty doped up that first day, but after that I just took Tylenol.  I haven't had any bleeding since the procedure and so far I'm doing great.  It will take another two months to find out how successful this was.  (No periods versus light periods, etc.)|`|s3mVZjzLaa	I went thru the exact same thing. They found miomas..same as fibroids. 3 of them. and after that i got the biopsy. What they do they scrape and test to see if its malignant. I got that done without anesthesia in dominican rep..but it was cheaper for me. and that felt sooo uncomfortable cuz i wasnt numb =(<br>  That will not make you be a candidate for hysterectomy. And the operation should be like 10 to 20 min...they have to scrape enough of your uterus lining to do testing..At the end they just told me they werent cancerous...and was diagnosed with miomas and endometriosis..so they gave me medications to break the fibroids down since they werent that big. a 6 mos treatment.if they are big then it requires surgery to remove them. I wish you luck and dont panic. You will be ok =)

To get it to burn you must give it fuel to work with, so starving is out of the question.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	If the body does not get enough food (nutrients), it goes into starvation mode. In this mode, the body stores everything it can as fat so it can survive. This slows the metabolism rate and when start eating again, the body stores this new intake as fat. Controlling calorie intake is only one part of the energy equation.<br>  <br>  Understand Energy Balance & Weight Management to lose weight effectively<br>  <br>  Rather than go on extreme diets by starving oneself or eating selected food groups, maintain a balanced diet. Eating small meals more frequently would help to maintain the metabolic rate and allow the body to get use to normal functioning with less calories.<br>  <br>  Dieting is temporary deprivation and not the best solution.

HcqRycY0aa	first I would recommend getting a gym membership to make it easier to keep up a good workout schedule and have the option to switch up cardio workouts. If you really want some definition by summer you have to very dedicated until summer. I recommend everyday eating a couple eggs with fruit for breakfast, chicken or another meat with vegetables for lunch, and have whatever you usually have for dinner. Drink only milk and water and take a multivitamin. Also small snack every now and than that are low sugar and not breads or potato's is great for keeping up metabolism. Something like home cooked beans and lentils are great. For a workout i suggest doing an upper body workout before cardio, than either running like you do followed by your ab workout or leg workout. I also suggest changing up the cardio to keep muscle confusion from having your routine new and effective in burning calories. the goal of your cardio should be to keep your heart rate above average for 20-30 minutes so it'll take about an hour a day to reach your goal. Remember, no sugar no sugar, only small ammounts of pasta, potatoes or breads and examples of healthy meats to eat are tuna and home cooked chicken. Once your in a routine it gets a lot easier to keep up. good luck|`|wwRbkCMraa	(removed my body fat).

OE3f12Mkaa	I've always suffered terribly with my skin after shaving, nothing seemed to help. I wet shave and this would probably cause less irritation. So I stopped shaving completely and used hair clippers instead, but joining the Navy meant I had no option but to be clean shaven everyday. I started doing some research and realised that I hadn't been shaving correctly. Seems technique is a big factor in reducing irritation.<br>  <br>  As far as creams go nothing has worked for me at all until I started using a traditional silicone based cream instead of the more modern foams and gels and all that other crap. I use one called "men-u shaving cream" about $17/￡10 and it's fantastic. It may seem abit steep but it lasts ages.

The creams are all based on soap, while the gels are based on moisturizers.  I shave with the gel and then use some more gel as an aftershave.

Vitamin C is water soluable meaning when your body has too much, you will get the runs.  When I am sick, I often take more than 500mg.  Besides, if you were drinking a lot of orange juice or tomato juice you would be getting 500mg and more anyway.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	the upper level for vitamin C is 2g per day. 1 gram=1000mg. above 2g you are more likely to experience stomach upset and diarrhea. Vitamin C toxicity is rare given that it is a water soluble vitamin but it still occurs. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would take 1 of the 500mg and call it a day. It only takes about 300mg of vitamin C to saturate your plasma with it.

When a bug is going around here, I usually take 1000 mg. in the morning and another 1000 mg. before bed.  Remember, vitamin C is water soluble which means that all the vitamin C you got in your morning juice is either used up or gone from your body by lunchtime.  One tablet does not give you all day protection.  If I really feel like I'm coming down with something, I pop 1000 mg. an hour until I start feeling better, which is usually after a few hours.  See what works best for you, but I'd start with 1000 in the morning and another 1000 at bedtime.|`|f9CytJuHaa	See my article on the subject:<br>  <a href="http://www.dadsview.com/health/vitamin-c-recommended-dose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dadsview.com/health/vitamin-c...</a>
ParFJxnSaa	It's caused by the reduced amount of sunlight in the winter months, resulting in low levels of vitamin D3. The topic is addressed in section 2, ( 4th & 5th pages) at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (see page R, next for a comprehensive post on depression, and view the rest of section 2, eventually; it's best to use a multidimensional approach to depression). One treatment is exposure for a sufficiently long period, daily, to special, high intensity lights, which you can either rent, or buy ( NOT TANNING SALON LIGHTS!!!, except the safe type, recommended by Dr. Mercola, below - they have been shown to cause an increase in skin cancer, and produce the wrong wavelength UV radiation) . <br>  <br>  "So how can you find out if your vitamin D levels are adequate? Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> - "vitamin D3; testing". Also enter: "S.A.D."<br>  <br>  Dr. Mercola now recommends VITAMIN D3 SUPPLEMENTS* for those unable to get sufficient daily exposure to strong light, (he also advises us not to shower for TWO HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE TO STRONG LIGHT, and informs us that excessive levels of vitamin D cause hardening of the arteries, so it is highly advisable to have your level of vitamin D tested at least twice, and preferably 3 times, in the first year, and once annually thereafter, in winter, if taking supplements. A base level is determined in the first test, then, 6 weeks later, test again to see whether the levels are near those recommended. A third test, later in winter, or early spring, is a good idea, as a check that all is going well.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	You don't necessarily need to "tan" just being outside for 15 minutes a day can help. It is the light taken in through the eyes that helps the most.  Skin exposure tho can help create Vitamin D which plays a role in offsetting depression SAD.

2RIaWgnFaa	The biggest reasons for your problems can be one of 2 things. Number one your only 14 so your baby fat may have not all gone away but that leaves with age seeing as you may get taller so I wouldn't worry about it that much. Number 2 it could run in your family genes so don't worry about it. Finally if you feel your not eating right then just watch your intake but honestly my little sister didn't lose her baby fat till she turn 15 and it's primarly due to the fact that her body hadn't mature as fast as others so even thought you may feel disproportioned your body is going through it's natural growth cycle. I hope this answered your question.|`|QU5neCD5aa	you havn't reached full puberty yet. your body will not reach your mature propertions until 16-17. also you may just have a pear shaped body.

If you have a larger lower body, it probably means you have pear shaped genetics. You'll tend to always have more mass, be it muscle or fat, on your lower body.<br>  <br>  You can get rid of excess fat through a proper diet combined with high intensity exercise and cardiovascular work. Simply exercising long periods at a comfortable pace will probably not burn enough calories to shed the extra weight. 20-25 minutes of 80-90% MHR work a day, 5 times a week will show fast results, so long as you stick with the program, diet right, and don't slack on the workouts.<br>  <br>  TL;DR, Could be all of the 3, probably mostly genetic. Do lots of cardio work at a rate that feels like you're going to die for a half hour a day, and follow a diet such as the zone or paleo diets and you'll shed extra pounds.|`|LrAd0OQZaa	what i suggest is go for short slow runs of start swimming i like both those and they're great core and whole body workouts i highly sugest it but they're may be better things out they're to do <br>  cheers<br>  <br>  nice avatar andy warhol is the sh*t|`|FyAHNpQbaa	you are pear shaped. there is nothing you can do about the shape of your body

wwwiWaK8aa	Eat three meals every day. Yes, this means you need to get up in time for breakfast, that you can't skip lunch, and that dinner actually needs to be prepared and eaten.<br>  <br>  Eat three snacks every day. That's right: midmorning, midafternoon and evening. In order to gain weight, you need to fuel your body at regular times. The easiest way is to set up a schedule of three meals and three snacks.<br>  <br>  Stop drinking non-caloric beverages. That includes diet soda, and plain coffee or tea. You're looking for calories, right? Choose skim or 1 percent milk (we want healthy calories, not fat, so avoid milk with higher fat contents), 100 percent fruit juice or sports drinks.<br>  <br>  Choose calorie-dense foods. That means eating potatoes, corn or peas instead of celery and carrot sticks. Or choosing a banana or cranberry juice instead of an apple or orange juice. Granola cereal is more calorie-dense than puffed rice. Read food labels for the serving size and the calories, and make it a habit to routinely choose foods that are higher in calories.<br>  <br>  Expand your meals. Each meal should include some type of starchy food (potato, rice, pasta, bread, cereal), fruits and vegetables, and a protein source (chicken, red meat, fish, tofu, peanut butter, legumes, eggs, cheese). Use two or three teaspoons of margarine or salad dressing with each meal to add moderate amounts of fat without going overboard.<br>  <br>  Exercise. Regular exercise and activity will help your body gain muscle and not unwanted fat. Thirty minutes of daily activity is plenty to get your system moving yet not so much that you're burning up tons of calories. If you are more active, you'll need to increase your calorie intake.|`|Nv4zY8Bbaa	Eat nutritious foods that are high in calories. Examples are whole-grain breads, vegetables such as avocados and potatoes, kidney beans, lean red meat, poultry and fish.<br>  <br>  Increase the caloric value of your meals.

Knowing how to gain weight involves consistent eating. Eat three meals a day and at least two snacks.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Focus on gaining muscle and bone mass by doing resistance exercise like weight training and adding lean protein to your diet.

Herpes is symptomatic and asymptomatic, meaning if someone has herpes they will know by their unsual symptoms (symptomatic).. However, there are times, people may not know that they have the virus for months and even up to a year (asymptomatic).<br>  <br>  The virus can be dormant for a long time in someones body.. It's a possibility that "Jerry" is a carrier and passed it to your sister while he was asymptomatic..  He may not know his self, because he may not have had an outbreak yet.. <br>  <br>  But then again, she did have relations with two other men in the past and there could be a possibility that one of her ex's had it... Passed it to her while they didn't have symptoms. She could have remained dormant during all that time and passed it to her current boyfriend... <br>  <br>  It could go either way..

Common severe infections include encephalitis, meningitis, neonatal herpes, and, in immunocompromised patients, disseminated infection. Mucocutaneous infections cause clusters of small painful vesicles on an erythematous base. Diagnosis is clinical; laboratory confirmation by culture, PCR, direct immunofluorescence, or serology can be performed. Treatment is symptomatic; antiviral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is helpful for severe infections and, if begun early, in recurrent or primary infections.<br>  Research suggests that the virus can be transmitted even when there are no symptoms present, so that a sexual partner without obvious genital herpes sores can still transmit the illness. In fact, asymptomatic spread may actually contribute more to the spread of genital herpes than do active sores.<br>  Once you are infected, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. Some people never have another episode, and others have frequent recurrences. In most recurrences, no obvious trigger is identified. Many people, however, find that attacks of genital herpes occur with the following conditions:<br>      * Fatigue<br>      * General illness (from mild illnesses to serious conditions, such as operations, heart attacks, and pneumonia)<br>      * Immunosuppression due to AIDS or medication such as chemotherapy or steroids<br>      * Menstruation<br>      * Physical or emotional stress<br>      * Trauma to the affected area, including sexual activity<br>  In people with a normal immune system, genital herpes remains a localized and bothersome infection, but is rarely life-threatening.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	she could've gotten it from jerry because he could be a-systematic (no symptoms) and he got it from some other girl he slept with...what people need to know and what they dont realize is that when they sleep with someone they are also sleeping with EVERYONE that that person has ever slept with...nice  huh?
0kWkX8yiaa	diarrhea usually comes 24 hours after you have eaten something bad...so whatever you ate yesterday is probably playing a part in your bathroom-mishaps. HOWEVER...everyone is different so it could be from either breakfast or lunch! hope you are feeling better|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	see your dr ,but i actually thought it was not from eating but that it could add to it ,just thought it was a bacterial diseased was always in the SYSTEM and people could be carriers of it .
vwoqIUR6aa	not really-if you are hungry have something small like a piece of fruit or some warm milk.
BpSx7Zrjaa	That cement feeling should wear away, if not, you can ask your orthodontist about it at your next checkup. You will get used to how your teeth feel and be able to eat solid foods shortly. It's uncomfortable, but within...I would say 3-5 days, you should feel pretty good. Just remember, it's all worth it in the end as long as you TAKE CARE of your teeth before, during, and especially after your braces.|`|AkV6TqPgaa	Yeah Im not going to lie to you, braces are not the greatest time in your life. Unfortunately its going to hurt every time they tighten your braces for a few days. Whenever I got mine tightened, they hurt for about 3-4 days. The first day, they dont hurt so much as they just feel tight, like there is a lot of pressure on them. At this time, I advise you to just chow down as much food as you can, because its going to be the last time you can eat solid food for a little while. Usually, the next day you wake up in the morning is when your going to have the worst time with it. The second day was always the worst for me. All I can advise is maybe take some warm water and mix it with salt and swish it in your mouth a few times a day. It tastes disgusting, but it helps relieve the inflammation of your gums and makes a big difference if you do it a few times a day. <br>  <br>  This will go on for 2 or so days, and then it will start getting better and better slowly. At this time, I dont advise you go eating chips or something else crunchy or hard, because it will start making them sore again. Gradually start eating more and more solid food, that way you dont make your mouth more sore for longer than it should be. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck with your braces, I know it seems terrible at the time, but when you get them off, you'll realize it was ALL worth it. =)|`|qOmqbow8aa	reading this makes my mouth hurt again.<br>  <br>  it'll take up to 3 weeks to get over the soreness.<br>  get bananas. <br>  the orthodontist can scrape away at that next time you're in.<br>  if you ever have to have rubberbands, it'll hurt a lot more. but WEAR THE RUBBER BANDS! you'll regret it later if you only where them part of the time that you're supposed to <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  clear braces? as in pops out? <br>  do not try and remove the cement yourself. You can scratch your enamel or seriously damage your braces or crack the cement|`|7nDAim4Jaa	The pain will last for around 5 days and around the 6th day you can eat decent food. Bonjela mouth numbing cream found in the baby section of the supermarket works really well to stop the pain and so does vaseline.  Good Luck|`|90LFCYxTaa	it will hurt for a week did your ortho give you wax if so put it on your braces brush your teeth and it will help a little bit have you tryed to take advil it helps any pain take 2|`|NJzye6kJaa	It'll stop hurting soon, don't worry. The cement will also come off on its own, i found.

iMjkmlV1aa	Creatine is VERY safe for a 16 year old as long as they cycle it for no longer than 2 months at a time, the first week load up, then maintain it by one (1) teaspoon every day before your workout. From personal experience it works great if you have a lean, skinny build and want to bulk up, if your overweight then it won't do a lot. Some users say it gives you a "puffy" look but that goes away after a few weeks. Most of the stories you have read are either from teens overdosing and/or not drinking enough water. The best thing to do is try one teaspoon starting off and seeing if he complains of cramps / stomach pains, if so make sure he's getting a gallon of water a day, if that doesn't help stop, if there's none it's fine.|`|GB5BuXhJaa	Well to be honest it is not that harmful of a product, unless as your son said you don't drink enought water and by enought water that is at least 4L a day. If not enough water is consumed you will have pains in your stomach and it can be bad for your kidneys. You really shouldn't be taking creatine until you are at least 18 years old or when you are done growing. You also need to be working out hard while you are on it. I would suggest for your son to wait until he is at least 18 before taking it. He should't even be working too seriously with heavy weights until he is 18. While he is 16 though, light weights and cardio would be good for him.|`|RPQ6Bamdaa	Creatine is a natural compound that works like a gas pump for your muscles. The fuel from which muscle cells draw energy is a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and creatine helps cells make new ATP to keep your tank from running low. Your kidneys, liver, and pancreas make about 1 to 2 grams of creatine every day, and most people get about that much daily from meat or fish in their diet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Many athletes, however, see creatine as something else: a shortcut to victory. From high school to the Olympics to big-time professional sports, cans of creatine have become almost standard equipment for some competitors. Today's creatine craze is built on a simple premise: The supplement safely builds muscle and strength. Experts, however, say creatine doesn't quite live up to the hype, and it may be more dangerous than its users think.<br>  <br>  WHY DOES YOUR SON WANT TO TAKE CREATINE????? PERHAPS THEIR IS A PHYSICHOLOGIAL ISSUE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BUILDING MUSCLE... I WOULD NOT CONDONE THE USE OF SUPPLEMENTS PERSOANHE IS REALLY<br>  <br>  AS A MOTHER IF YOU FEEL THAT HE WILL USE IT WISELY AND RESPONSIABLY THAN MOTHER KNOWS BEST|`|Pw1fCNvXaa	creatine is naturally produced in our bodies. it comes from eating meat and such. i suggest starting off with creatine monohydrate<br>  <br>  as a supplement, theres nothing to fear. however, it is highly advised that he drinks a lot of water so his kidneys dont get a working over by the creatine.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Dear concerned mother,<br>  <br>  i've left a link to an article, "Creatine Monohydrate Fact Sheet, FAQs & Product List"<br>  <br>  I hope it answers some of your questions.|`|EBkW1ME4aa	i use creatine, and im 15 yr. old. its fine if you maintain the proper diet and know when to take it in and when not to, which is on the box. Great product btw.|`|vx2MaQg0aa	IMO it would be better if he wait till hes 18.. Creatine could mess up your kidneys real bad if you dont know what your doing with it.. He might not notice anythin bad right now but later on he might have a kidney problem and yes you have to drink lots and lots of water when on creatine so i dont recommend till hes 18.. <br>  Do what feels right if you wanna buy it for him go ahead but i wouldnt use it myself even tho im 20|`|0s3QjkuBaa	i am 17 and took it for 2 years when lifting for football and im fine.

It's the same with your ears, they're both made of cartlidge.<br>  <br>  Touching your nose will not cause it to expand in size, In theory - picking it could stretch it slightly, probably if you always had your finger up there - pushing at the skin vigourously.<br>  <br>  I beleive your suspicions are just psychological, stop worrying. If it will put your mind at ease, just stop picking your nose. Use a tissue, it is a lot more civillised and hygenic. Picking is a thilthy habit.|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	It depends on how old you are, but i know that my nose has grown a lot during puberty, so if you are going through any hormonal changes its very possible that your nose will get larger.|`|QSAPw7AOaa	"I am not an animal."|`|XRoQES7baa	No it isn't.

You should quit lying ;)|`|RxpxK16Vaa	Hey, I think it is not possible to grow ones nose by picking, but one thing I wanted to say that, may be picking will add an additional speed for your growing nose.......bcz picking will increase the blood flow to your nose and then more functionality to your nose cells....<br>  and I also guess picking will cause your nose to grow in the shape or way you ll be picking...........|`|G8fj7bq0aa	Good question.  Has your nose picking increased excessively in the past two years?  (haha, j/k, but you did mention that)  I have heard that noses and ears continue to grow throughout our lives and have always believed it to be true.|`|BbTf6ZL9aa	quit telling lies
iK3YYRaTaa	From the drug store!|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Any pharmacy. It IS legal to buy insulin over the counter in many of the United States of America WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. My father did and I have been doing that FOR DECADES in LA and OK. As long as you are willing to pay full price, there is NO pharmacy in the United States that can legally refuse to sell you insulin without a prescription. Insulin is a life-saving drug, as my more than 53 year life since I was diagnosed in May, 1955 proves.|`|8bQkJ2Zjaa	Well, if you have diabetes, you need to contact your doctor to write a prescription. If you don't have diabetes, you do not need insulin. A lot of people think that insulin will get you "high" when it does no such thing-in fact if you are not a diabetic and you take a high does you could easily end up in a deep coma or death-very painful and exhausting. Please, only use insulin if you are in need of it, or else other people who are in need of it may not get it. Insulin is a life saving drug for diabetics|`|gql3cQCLaa	if you have diabetes you need to contact ur doctor and find out what insulin would be right 4 u. it will then come in a pack with ice packs to keep it cold. just make sure to keep it in the fridge. u can get insulin either from ur doctor or a hospital. but make sure u consult ur doctor  on which insulin would be right 4 u.|`|395PjPKAaa	hey i have no way to talk to you you blocked everyone from emailing you how can we b friends?|`|pivCnU0daa	chemists :D<br>  or maybe ebay?|`|AA10918002	I agree 100% with Erin. Normally a specialist diagnose a patient and prescribe the insulin after numerous tests and here in South-Africa we cannot get insulin without a prescription. So please make sure of your medical condition as this could be fatal if your body doesn't need extra insulin.|`|HUrLVofYaa	Your doctor can write you a script to obtain insulin from a chemist. It's not legal to buy insulin over the counter without a prescription.|`|B23gd3wjaa	from your doctor....
6YnwXCIaaa	It's possible you've fractured a rib.  Rib fractures tend to get even more painful over the first week.  You could have also bruised the area badly.  There is generally no treatment necessary for rib fractures other that controlling the pain, unless you've punctured a lung.  If you've been having difficulties breathing, you should be assessed by a doctor.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	If you're concerned about it maybe you should just go and get it checked out.

Y1LTzXataa	Some nurses still wear the hat but it is no longer required. The hat was a part of the dress uniform and it identified your place in the nursing hierarchy and which school you graduated from.<br>  <br>  There are two reasons that nurses stopped wearing them. Firstly, they aren't practical, as they can slide off the head. Secondly, it is a woman's hat and when male nurses entered the profession there was no hat for them and some female nurses decided that if the male nurses didn't have to wear a hat then neither did they.<br>  <br>  The proper name for the hat is a Nurse's cap.

K2h6M1xqaa	Hm.  I'd be VERY cautious about allowing ANY kind of drugs being prescribed.  It's always best if you can solve things without pharmaceuticals.<br>  <br>  When I was your age, I needed TONS of sleep, and I think it's quite natural.  Kids at your age are growing and changing a lot, and this takes up mountains of energy, which naturally leaves you sleepy.  The school day is designed to accommodate adults and their schedules, not kids, who really do need more rest and lots of food energy.  --Some kids aren't as affected by this; I found I never had as much energy as some kids who were able to participate in after-school activities and all kinds of fun things when all I wanted to do was sleep my life away.  I wasn't sad about this; sleep was good and it felt right.<br>  <br>  I missed lots of morning classes and my marks were really affected by this, but it didn't affect my success later on in life at all.  School is really quite over-hyped to kids.  As long as you learn how to read and you take an interest in learning, then you can pick up any knowledge you want in great depth later on if you need to.  I am one of the more knowledgeable people I know today, and I pretty much slept through most of school, and I never went to college.  I now lecture sometimes at different schools because of all the life experience and learning I've gained on my own.  But boy, did I EVER sleep a lot when I was younger!<br>  <br>  Though, I did stay up late a fair bit.  I found that my brain was alert and sharp at night.  Go figure.<br>  <br>  Anyway, just be sure to eat right, (and look into foods which are healthy for your blood type, and try to eat organic foods whenever you have the choice.)  Get good exercise, and try to enjoy the rest you can get.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|csUUr11gaa	I would say that you may have a case of depression or dysthymia.  However, your additional details aren't congruous with my idea.  Dysthymia is similar to depression in that it is a mood disorder.  However, it isn't as intense as depression.  Dysthymia is when an individual can have just a lingering feeling if irritation or a lack of determination.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if this ring any bells for you, but it kinda fits with your description.

You need a different doctor - one who knows when antibiotics are appropriate and when they're not.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	This story is weird because everybody knows that antibiotics don't work for the flu, or for any other virus.<br>  Then you said the doctor started you on a strong antibiotic; and when you didn't get better, he gave you a weak one.  <br>  If you have a virus, [and i suspect you do, if what you say is true] there is nothing you can do to cure it; it has to run its course.  Take whatever meds you want for the symptoms; if you have chest congestion, I'd suggest Robitussin.  But the doctor may give you something too, NOT an antibiotic.  Maybe an inhaler.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	nah it isnt a resistant flu.. theres different kinds of antibiotics for different kinds of flus/sicknesses<br>  <br>  the amoxicillin should work|`|KkaSPwQkaa	if its a virus then antibiotics are completely useless<br>  it sounds like it may be a form of viral pneumonia|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Your doctor doesn't know what he's doing - when someone has symptoms that could be due to cold or flu (which is caused by a virus, not bacteria), antibiotics should only be prescribed if tests show bacterial infection. Taking antibiotics for a viral infection won't help, and could actually encourage the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could end up infecting you and then would be difficult to treat.<br>  <br>  At this point if you aren't starting to feel better, you should definitely see another doctor, and make sure you tell the new doctor what drugs you've been taking and for how long.

I will have you know my husband would be an AMAZING father, and is no harm to my children.<br>  <br>  Things happen in their lives that we cant wont and never will be able to understand.  Almost every sever schizophrenic says the voice say to kill themselves and or other people.  At this point they need to be seen by a psychiatrist, and if it gets far out of hand the police need to be brought into it, and they need to be checked into an institution.  you better take care of it before they have a break down when they hallucinate and kill themselves.<br>  <br>  be very very careful.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	The first one is completely legal. Just because someone has been diagnosed with schizophrenia does not mean they are dangerous/a risk to anyone. Schizophrenics can raise children and live in a home with them just fine.<br>  <br>  The second question- it depends on the exact situation. If the caretaker is a legal caretaker its more likely than if they are just someone who takes care of them, if that makes sense? If the person with schizophrenia has been declared mentally incompetent and the parent or whoever is their guardian, or the person is a minor, or the 'caretaker' is some sort of mental or living facility charged with their well being then the caretaker is more likely to be held responsible for this persons actions. If the schizophrenic person is an adult and just like living at their parents house and go out and shoot up a shopping mall then no, the parents aren't actually responsible. <br>  <br>  If there's a child in the house though, then the caretaker could get in trouble for child endangerment/neglect by allowing the kid to be around someone who is making this sort of threats and is obviously unstable/dangerous.|`|4S8IKFn0aa	1-Yes it's legal.

It may also be that you have what many mothers experience in a thickened mucous and your sinuses just might be packed with a sinus infection but either way,I would seriously advise you to get in and have the doctor check the epidural whole to rule out a slow leak so it can be patched properly if it hasn't been closed correctly,it's not that uncommon.If it turns out you need an antibiotic for sinusitis,this needs to be addressed as well because infants are still susceptible to numerous illnesses even though they are usually full of atibodies,especially from breast feeding.My youngest was breast fed the same as my older 4 and he still almost died from RSV. The doctors don't seem to know how RSV is aquired so if you've caught a nasty bug,get in and get better.I'm sorry you are in so much pain and I hope you feel better soon and can finally enjoy your sweet blessing without such pain. Please make an appointment to be seen immediately and if you're told there won't be 1 available until tommorow I would strongly advise a visit to the Emergency Room for the spinal check,it is life threatening for spinal fluid to be leaking and my Daughter could have died. God bless you and your new blessing.

VDXKqoejaa	That "musty" odor you describe is the smell of a healthy vagina. To you, enjoyment of the aroma or taste may not make sense, but to most men, it represents one of the pinnacles of the sexual experience. The flavor is unique, and perhaps owing to the abundance of hormones, is greatly looked forward to.<br>  <br>  A healthy, clean vagina is not unpleasant, but rather, an enjoyable, if acquired taste. My advice: stop worrying, and stop the excessive cleaning rituals, as they can be harmful. Your boyfriend obviously enjoys your taste, so either your views are in error, or the entire male population, 50% of the earth, is wrong.<br>  <br>  Trust me - just keep it clean (IE: normal washing), and he will enjoy it.|`|0KGJRVMNaa	If you don't shave, do it. I guarantee it will not smell anymore. <br>  Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing anything wrong, just use a mild soap or a feminine wash and dry yourself off real good.<br>  It sounds like your boyfriend doesn't care and you probably don't even smell as bad as you think.|`|x3RGtco8aa	talk to you gyno. my friend had this same problem and her doctor told her that when a woman ph levels are off it will smell. her doc gave her some pills to help even the levels.|`|UlOKMInqaa	I'm not sure what you should do about the smell but douching isn't good for you because it throws off the pH of your vagina.|`|AA10344737	Well first off, perfumes and douches are bad for your vagina.  It throws the natural cleansing out of whack and will increase odors.<br>  <br>  I asked my boyfriend about this.  I feel the same way and always feel like I'm pressuring him to do it.  He constantly reassures me that not only do I smell fine, but that I taste wonderful and he wouldn't do it if he didn't enjoy it.  <br>  <br>  Just use soap and water to clean your vagina and invest in wipes (sold by pads).  I use these and feel better about myself down there.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|T9fek24eaa	I have to agree with Matthias on this. You probably have not been up in other girls business, but that is normal. Vaginal secretions DO smell. Actually I just watch a study about this the other night, but the smell of a womans vaginal secretions actually turns men on because it is a sign of health and fertility. Its not a BAD thing for him...<br>  <br>  Another thing that can cause a foul smell is your diet. If you are eating foods like garlic, onions, fish, or eggs (just to name a few) it will cause a more pungent odor (and taste.) There are also foods that you can eat that make you taste "sweet." I have heard asparagus and pineapple do that. Alot of water is helpful with that too. Also yogurt (eating it) will also help vaginal health and it wards off yeast infections. <br>  <br>  As some women have mentioned, douching is not good for you. It throws off the pH balance which can cause you to have an infection. It probably does not do as much good as you think it does.|`|ad8dOQVWaa	STOP DOUCHING!  Omfg, you're going to give yourself an infection doing that.  Calm the f-ck down girl, your vag does not smell bad and without their face in it no one will notice.  As a woman who has been in relationships with woman and men, I feel confident in telling you that yes he can smell it, and chances are it turns him on.  If you are going to be paranoid just don't eat too much meat, cheese, beans, and salty foods.  Fruits and carbs make the smell/taste slightly sweeter, whereas meats and salts make it a bit stronger.<br>  <br>  But really, your vagina is fine.  Get over it and STOP DOUCHING.  God, its just so bad for your vagina, I don't know who's idea douching was to begin with, but that sh-t should be outlawed.<br>  <br>  Sorry for flipping out there.  It's just, everyone smells down there.  Its not a bad thing, don't worry about it.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi katie,<br>  <br>  An ECG stands for ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. It records the pattern of your heart rhythm and from that we can tell if a heart is normal or not. if not, it tells us what the problem is just by looking at it.<br>  <br>  A heart scan is actually looking at pictures of the heart itself.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what you mean by heart test as there are several different ones but i hope this simplified answer is what you needed to know.<br>  <br>  Love mel.X|`|I1knk17zaa	An ECG or EKG is an electrocardiogram.   This gives the physician a view from 12 different areas of the heart.   Each lead represents a certain area of the heart- and if abnormalities are seen the doctor will know which area of the heart is being affected or is damaged.   EKG's can show if there is a heart attack,  can show if there is Ischemia ( heart muscle that is starving for oxygen but not yet dead) .  Not all EKG abnormalities indicate heart damage- some abnormalities may be simply from electrolyte imbalances or medication toxicity.   Not all heart attacks show up on EKG's either.   If someone has had an EKG and then has another one- sometimes the doctor will know if the pt has had even an old heart attack if there are changes.   The aspects of the PQRST waves and their size, length, presence, or absence can give the physician a lot of info-  if it is an acute heart attack, if there is just ischemia, if there is an arrhythmia, and or if there is disease-example ( cardiac tamponade or endocarditis).

I can tell you that if even 1 person in a clinical trial of medications have a side effect, it has to be listed as a side effect of the medication.  Millions of people are prescribed and take Naproxen every day without incident.  I have diabetes, arthritis, AF and high blood pressure and my Dr recommends Naproxen for my arthritis because it is safer than the normal arthritis drugs like celebrex.  I have taken if for about 3 years as needed with no problems.

In reality, the human body is super complex and has its own ways of regulating pH, mostly with the kidney and lungs, which don't need help.  <br>  I would recommend saving your money, or using it to buy your child something that might cheer her up a bit.  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|T9fek24eaa	I am so sorry to hear about your daughters cancer. <br>  <br>  I have never heard anything like this, but I just wanted to say PLEASE do not take any stock into anything ANYONE on yahoo answers tells you.

AkV6TqPgaa	I used to have this problem for a few years also. My dentist and I realized it was because I had abnormally sensitive gums, and the bristles on my toothbrush was making my gums break. If you are having the same or close to the same problem as I had, you need to stimulate your gums carefully every night. That can come anywhere from using floss and massaging your gums between your teeth, and using a soft rubber pick to massage your gums. This should strengthen your gums and resist the bleeding a little bit. Hope this helps!

xmibEEdcaa	Yes, TN can cause constant pain. When it does, it's usually classified as "atypical trigeminal neuralgia."<br>  <br>  If a blood vessel is pressing on the nerve, an MRI ordered to focus in tightly on the trigeminal nerve ought to catch it, but sometimes the cause of trigeminal neuralgia isn't as readily apparent as a blood vessel pressing on a nerve. Sometimes (as in my case) there's no visible cause at all to explain why the nerve keeps firing. <br>  <br>  There's a useful breakdown of the various types of TN and related facial pain problems here:<br>  <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/cranial_nerves/trigeminal_neuralgia/manuscript/types.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.umanitoba.ca/cranial_nerves/t...</a><br>  <br>  (Although bear in mind while reading it that this website is focused on MVD, so it tends to overstate both the probability of a blood vessel pushing on a nerve as the evident cause *and* the efficacy of the MVD operation as a cure for TN.  Nonetheless, if you can overlook that, it's still a pretty decent breakdown.)

7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	When you think negative thoughts, analyze them. Are they really true? Make sure that you are being honest with yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, be aware of how you talk to yourself. If you find yourself thinking poorly of yourself, stop that thought in its tracks and think about something more positive. Repeat that positive thought over and over again. Focus on your strengths as often as possible. When you cannot do that, focus on how you can improve upon your weaknesses, instead focusing on your weaknesses themselves.<br>  <br>  Hang around good friends. Choose a group of friends and relatives that will be honest with you about yourself, but supportive at the same time.<br>  <br>  If your life is not the way you want it to be, take steps to change it. Decide what you want your life to be like. Make goals and write them down. Then figure out what little things you can do right now to work toward those goals, and what things you can do later to continue working toward the person you want to be.<br>  <br>  I find that God is very helpful, too. He does know everything, after all, and He only wants what's best for you. :-)

K4zsztkRaa	Why is it not normal? I mean that's what you were born with, so it's perfectly normal and natural.<br>  Also uncircumcised your penis will be a lot more sensitive. If you get circumcised you will lose a lot of sensitiivty, you should know that. So do keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  It's going to cost a lot of money to get it done so keep that in mind, insurance doesn't cover it. <br>  <br>  You do what ever you feel is best for you. If you want to get it done go get it done, if it's not truly that important then don't.<br>  But you have to make sure it's something you really, really want otherwise your might regret it.<br>  <br>  I was circumcised at birth and honestly I can't find a single good thing about it. Your head is always dried out and claoused over from rubbing against your pants so it's less sensitive and numb, and you have a scar with an odd color change, and you don't enjoy sex as much.<br>  I am restoring my foreskin and I have felt the sensitivity difference so I know that's a fact.<br>  <br>  Whether or not circumcision is right for you, is really a personal choice, there really is no fact to which is better over the other because it's personal prefrence. Find out what your prefrence is and go with that.<br>  Not that many guys are circumcised these days. The circumcision rate is 50% and most males in the world are uncircumcised 80%. So it's not weird or unnatural.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also studies have proven females enjoy sex with uncircumcised males more the circumcised guys because the foreskin bunches up durring sex and feels like a ribbed condom.<br>  Looke uip sex as nature intended it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look go with what you personaly want.

There is no real reason to get circumcised unless you are have difficulties.   There is a likelihood of reducing pleasurable sensation and if you are NOT having problems, health insurance won't cover it and you'll have to pay the whole bill.|`|4e5d4a1a7ed268b398e3f6a34abdba78aa	It will be extremely painful for a while and then you will star to lose sensitivity in the end of your dick.

Secondly, women do not care if you have a tiny piece of skin at the end of your penis.  Personally, I am not circumcised, and do not intend to be. If anything, you should be proud of your foreskin!  All Removing it does is dry out the end of your penis, hurt, and make oral and hand jobs last for hours.  Your foreskin keeps the tip of your penis sensitive and therefore, sex, be it vagina, hand, or mouth, is better!|`|UlOKMInqaa	If you have been uncircumcised for 20 years, why change that now?

I doubt that there is any advantage to getting a circumcision at this late date. You obviously have learn how to take care of yours with the foreskin. You should only do things like this based upon what YOU really want or need, not what you might see in pictures or otherwise.|`|lFYtJLgfaa	Don't do it.  I hate being circumcised.  The glans of the penis becomes dry and loses sensation.  It doesn't really have any benefit.  Those who say it prevents disease have a religious agenda.  How is uncircumcised not normal?  It is how you were born.  Read up on the issue and you will see that the foreskin is keeping your glans moist and healthy.  Circumcision was adopted in the West originally to stop masturbation.  Then in the 80's it was to prevent HIV.  The only way to prevent HIV is to use a condom and be careful about who you sleep with.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Being uncircumcised is being unmutilated, natural and normal.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is an abnormal and unnatural mutilation of the penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity and has adverse effects and complications that the doctors don't disclose and in fact suppress.<br>  <br>  You can look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS, just type it in on your browser, and you will see some of the adverse effects of male genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  I was mutilated by circumcision as a helpless infant, with no choice in the matter; it was forced on me.<br>  <br>  This resulted in more than the usual loss of sexual sensitivty, which usually is about 50-75%, and the damage made it impossible for me to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I have restored my foreskin, and this has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function.    Orgasms are also much more intense.<br>  <br>  Very few men ever choose to be circumcised, as it's usually perpetrated on infants who can't choose for themselves, and can't defend themselves against the assault and mutilation.<br>  <br>  There are no advantages to circumcision, which Americans are finally understanding, as the rate of mutilation has fallen to about 50%, down from 80% not too many years ago.<br>  <br>  Most men in the world are uncircumcised, whole and normal.      The peoples of Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia think that circumcision is weird and unnatural; which it is.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC

I started getting stretch marks when I was about 12 and I hit a huge growth spurt and I got really tall. At first I got them on my upper thighs and hips from getting tall, then I got them on my boobs when they started getting bigger. Then when I started getting my "womanly" hips I got them going side ways across my low back. I was never fat, I was very tall and slender. It just happened that way. <br>  <br>  Now I am 25, I have been through pregnancy once and am on my 2nd pregnancy and I have a LOT more stretch marks than I had when I was a teenager. I have been with MEN and of course my husband and I can tell you, when you get to that point, your partner will not care, because chances are he or she has them too ;) No man or woman is expecting you to look like the fake airbrushed people in the magazines except for you. <br>  <br>  There is nothing that can make them go away and there is nothing that will prevent them. If you are going to have them, you will have them no matter what you do. The good news is, over time they will fade. The ones on my hips you can barely tell they are there now.|`|s3xyOiyXaa	Well, try Vaseline (sorry if i spelled that wrong) on the stretch marks and /or rub them with skin lotion everyday until they go away if this doesnt work ask a doctor but i hope this will help!|`|FLXQ56DMaa	Vitamen E oil its great for scars and stretch marks.

I'm 24 and I still have trouble gaining weight. I work out all the time to gain muscle mass, but my natural metabolism is so high that it is hard for me to gain muscle mass. The solution to my problem was to take in about 6,000 calories a day, but to do that you would either have to eat very unhealthy foods or stuff yourself every time you eat healthy foods. That was getting way too expensive for me because I was eating about 5 huge meals a day which was costing me about $200 a week in groceries. I went to GNC to see if they had any solutions for me and they had a powder shake mix that has 2,000 calories a scoop and it was filled with vitamins and protein also. Perfect for weight gaining the healthy way. So instead of eating so much food and spending all that money at the grocery store I just buy a jug of Weight Gain powder at GNC about twice a month and I have seen phenomenal results. I have gained about 25lbs. of muscle since I started taking it. Just remember that when you are taking in that many calories it is essential that you keep a very vigorous workout routine, otherwise you are bound to put on a little chub.<br>  <br>  Before I started taking the calorie supplement I was stuck at about 165 lbs. and spending way too much money on groceries with no results. When I got on the supplement it took me about 3 months to get up to around 190lbs. And with my workout routine it was all Muscle. I'm very happy with the results!<br>  <br>  hope that helps!

Place on your night table. When insomnia hits....open the jar and take a few good whiffs. Lie back and think lovely thoughts. You'll be sawing logs within fifteen minutes. Open your mouth and try to yawn. Bring on a yawn... another....another...keep going...chances are you'll be asleep in no time. Or, have a cup of relaxing herbal tea.

7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Well, Bubba! A LOT of getting better is you must make a commitment to YOURSELF to make improvements. Sitting around feeling sorry for yourself & going over your body w/a fine tooth comb looking for problems aint the way to go! Try this: No smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs, no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's. Get yourself on a good, balanced, healthy diet including lots of boiled or steamed vegetables. Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & milk. Fix yourself a milkshake every day & add (1) raw egg to the blender for extra protein. Snack on RAW fruit & veggies. Stay away from fried, greasy, highly seasoned foods that are hard to digest. Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner. Flip your mattress over so it will level out & give you a good nite's rest. Everybody needs 15 minutes a day of sun on exprosed portions of their skin to get enough Vitamin D. Eat 2 banana's a day to keep your potassium level up so you don't get weak. Sensitivity to cold sounds a little like diabetes.

There are several conditions you should be getting checked for- diabetes,  thyroid issues,  and perhaps a GI consult to see if you have something like Chrohn's. If it is diet-  simple electrolyte imbalances can cause chest pain along with palpitations and arrhythmias.   You should be getting this stuff checked out! If you are not eating,  you'd better start eating.   People do die from not eating enough-  usually from electrolyte imbalances and poor nutrition.|`|Q61IFUoCaa	sounds to me like your body is suffering from malnutrition, eat alot better!!!!|`|ec9836919fb55072c190a5143de1a065aa	No. 1 - Take a bath and eat some chicken.<br>    No. 2 - Get in your car ( or take a bus ) and cruise to the mall-- get a Metallica CD !!!<br>    No. 3 - Find some kind of chick !!!!!!

I only have that disease running through my family.  I'm not sure where you live, but you should see a gastroenterologist.  They can be found in a big hospital usually.  They have to do with the guts and stuff.  If you have an eating problem and you find peeing hard, it might be a problem with those guts of yours.  <br>  <br>  I'd really appreciate it if you sent me a personal email.  I could probably help you out further because I am familiar with different illnesses to a certain degree.  I pray that whatever it is is not serious and that you will soon recover and be able to live to your fullest extent.<br>  <br>  Grace and Peace,<br>  DT (David-Taylor)
XRoQES7baa	Candles, music, a bath pillow,  a bottle of wine and a friend.|`|EdoUZTjPaa	My best bubble bath... Yummy bubble bath scents, scented candles and I like to set up a playlist with relaxing music on my ipod. If I'm feeling ambitious I will sometimes get my pamper me stuff like body scrub, face mask, deep hair conditioner, but usually just to relax the bubble bath, candles and music will do nicely.|`|yKCfJVWGaa	Yayy i love bubble baths.. Umm definitely use candles! like a lot.. i'd say about 4 (preferably vanilla scented or cucumber). and some good music.. maybe some classic rock :P such as the doors or beatles.. but then again i don't know you so i don't know your style! lol just saying what i do when i take a bubble bath because classic rock relaxes me.. so choose a genre of music that relaxes you as well. and a glass of wine is always good! and of course.. LOTS OF BUBBLES! :) and just soak in the greatness for about i'd say 30 minutes, ohh and make sure the water is hot! so it will last longer too|`|aVjyCXj7aa	Firstly get a few candles to set the mood, believe me they are soo relaxing. Next thing to do is get some bath salts and add it to the water when it's running. Grab your bubble bath, a scented one goes down well.

1hkHaxRIaa	Well, it's simple.  It's all about our hormonal level.  Our hormonal level is low during menstruation, then it gets higher.  On the Ovulation Day is the highest, and if fertilization doesn't happen, our hormonal level is going down again, so does our mood.  We are living on a hormonal roller coaster.|`|eO5sddfLaa	mmm <br>  yeah<br>  sometimes<br>  maybe its that pmdd stuff<br>  it happens <br>  your hormones get all out of wack|`|kMesQjEDaa	there are times where when u are on your period things are emotionally more sensitive it depends on whats going on because I'm like u I don't get mood swings and cry over something that is not a big deal but that's the way women are built now if u are like this all the time then I would worry then u would need to go see a doctor
zSkC7hsGaa	Think of your goal, getting fit for the navy.<br>   hire a personal trainer to put together some fun and different workout routines for you.<br>   Your routines need to stay the same for about 4 weeks, then mix it all up for something fresh. Since you don't have a lot of time change your workout about every 2 weeks. That way you have variety, not doing the same old stuff every day.<br>   Take your ipod with you loaded with music that really fires you up, your time at the gym will seem much shorter listening to you own tunes.|`|jLnhnDjhaa	keep going.. self motivation is a part of the brain if you keep pushing yourself to go it will exercise that part of the brain and it will become easier to go.. just like making yourself do homework and studying in college|`|pivCnU0daa	listen 2 ur ipod or watever it'll help u :D|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Change your routine!

JPVttkC0aa	I doubt it will kill you and it shouldn't cause any digestion problems. When i had my braces i must have swallowed like thirty of the brace elastic bands and i never seemed to hurt me at all. The only way it would hurt you is if you are allergic and since they are in your mouth i'm pretty sure you're ok, and the dentist would warn you if they might cause you any problems.<br>  So no worries you should be all right!!!!!|`|jlsMQvtpaa	no i've swallowed a couple and im just fine i freaked out too but my dentist said it was ok and i was lol....so dont worry :)|`|rlubvjfVaa	Your mom is right.  It will pass through your intestines and exit when you have a bowel movement.

zico37Kkaa	if you have been doing a lot of physical activity or you have had a change in your diet, its not unusual to have white discharge. You are definitely not pregnant if you have had 2 periods since your last time having sex.You are actually quite the opposite. White discharge means you are very fertile, because it is a mucus that is produced to carry and protect the sperm on its way to the egg. So you might want to not have sex while you are still producing this discharge.|`|ml8Gamoraa	No, you aren't pregnant. If you've had two periods since the last time you had sexual intercourse then that proves the egg was not fertilized, or did not implant in the uterus. You are probably experiencing a hormonal imbalance due to some amount of stress, or if you have been sick (i.e. flu, cold, etc.) then that could also throw off your internal balance. <br>  As for the white discharge, this could be from any number of things, ranging from a different diet, stress or medication.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't get your period at all this month, don't worry! Your body may be recovering from any of the above alterations. However, if you feel there is something more, you should consult your doctor or GYNO soon. Hopefully, you'll get it next month! Good luck!|`|bPeSiqaTaa	well, think about it, try to remember, if you had any unprotected sex,  its a possibility that you're pregnant. i suggest you take a pregnancy test when you think ure definitely not getting the period, but as soon as possible, and if you are, then u can take actions as soon as possible without facing big consequences. in future, if you do happen to have unprotected sex, and ure worried about getting pregnant, think about it the second it happens, not when you miss your period. there are so much things you can do to prevent unwanted pregnancy.|`|jb9guNo3aa	If you've had two actual periods, as in with blood clots, heavy as they usually are, long as usual, and you haven't had sex since before your last period, then you are NOT pregnant.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	take a pregnancy test if your worried ever. at least a week after your missed period. discharge sometimes means its coming.

CmLDWTJiaa	i am 22 and i have sleep apnea so i unnderstand the pertenance of sleep to answer your question i will delve away for the standard answer because there is not one standard human, the typical person needs to cycles of whats called R.E.M sleep also know as Rapid Eye Movement one cycle lasts for four hours so technically you need more than eight hours due to the fact that you need to fall into REM which takes time and there is time in between cycles. Also a human can get 1 REM cycle and be productive. the only time Eight hours is not enough is for someone with sleep apnea who gets zero REM sleep and stays in a distant state or if they have insomnia and cant sleep, i hope this answers your question if not google sleep cycles.|`|p1mSR5Awaa	6-8. 8 preferably|`|5xuubN5Caa	I'm 16...well just a couple week until 17 yrs old, and I think you should be getting a minimum of 6 hours and max 8 hours. (Just like Tres D said). More than 8 hours is really a waste of time because 8 hours is more than enough sleep and 6 hours is just fine. It's not going to kill you to sleep 6 hours a day. But I usually sleep 5 - 6 hours a day.

FicyC2TXaa	You might get away with it once, you might get away with it 20 times. But you might not, and it's not worth the risk. Taking blood pressure from the affected arm can trigger lymphoedema, and should be avoided. The risk doesn't increase with the number of times - a one-off can do it.<br>  <br>  I developed lymphoedema over 2 years after my mastectomy and lymph node removal, and I'm not sure what triggered it - I just looked down and saw that my arm and part of my hand were significantly swollen. The only explanation I could come up with was that I had carried some fairly heavy shopping bags the day before. But it could just as easily have been a bump or something that I didn't notice,<br>  <br>  That's how easy it can be to trigger lymphoedema; to minimise your risk follow all the advice - don't allow injections, blood tests, blood pressure etc on the affected arm, do your best to avoid scratches, cuts, burns, sunburn, insect bites etc to the arm, don't use the arm for heavy, or even moderate, lifting etc.<br>  <br>  Once you've got lymphoedema, you've got it. Do your best to avoid it<br>  <br>  This is part of breastcancer.org's explanation about how lymphoedema occurs:<br>  <br>  ''You can think of lymphedema as a plumbing problem: Veins and lymphatic channels are like pipes and drains that can handle the normal load of lymphatic fluid. If lymph nodes and channels are removed, there might not be enough pipes and drains to handle all the fluid.<br>  <br>  This can become a real problem when blood flow to your arm increases because of an infection, a burn, overusing the muscles of the arm, or even a bug bite. In these situations, the increased amount of lymphatic fluid flowing in can sometimes be too much for the arm's lymphatic vessels. If the fluid channels can't keep up with all that extra fluid, the fluid begins to back up and gather in the spaces between the cells of your arm's soft tissues. These tissues include the skin, fat, muscle, nerves, blood and lymphatic vessels, and connective tissue. The swelling resulting from this buildup of lymphatic fluid is called arm lymphedema''|`|AA10818277	Hi there, I'm Tina owner of lymphland international lymphedema online support group.  You can see my credentials under my profile.<br>  <br>  When you get lymphedema for any reason, it means that 30% of your lymph system is impaired at least.  Any trauma, pressure, bug bite, any trauma of any kind can trigger lymphedema.  <br>  <br>  The pressure from a blood pressure cuff can be quite intense and constricting on an area where there are no nodes, impaired lymph supply, etc.  So when you add the trauma of the cuff inflating on an impaired area, it pushes too  much fluid in and out of the area at one time to the nodes in the arm, that your body may not be able to get back out again.<br>  <br>  The new theory on lymphedema is that the people who get it for any reason are genetically prone to it to start with.  That said (Study happening by Dr. Stanley Rockson at the moment) any trauma can cause lymphedema in a person prone to it, it could just be from a mosquito bite which is not alot of trauma at all, so the blood pressure cuff is realy a major risk to take.<br>  <br>  Tina
f890d82e3b2cb1a15aa475ff75321c1aaa	Yes, that should help you lose weight :]. Make sure not to dip below 1200 calories, though! Less than that will push a female's body into starvation mode, meaning you don't lose weight as easily because your body is holding on to all of the fats and calories it can. Men need more like 1500 a day, minimum. You should probably be eating more like 1500 since you're working out so much, in addition.<br>  Make sure you're spreading your meals out evenly.

ct2uFkPNaa	Masturbation is stimulating your genitals to make yourself feel good.  For boys, this usually involves handling your penis, and rubbing up and down on your penis with your hand.  This is how boys learn about sexual feelings, and the knowledge about your body that you gain while masturbating will be useful when you get older, and engage in sexual activity with a partner.  Masturbation is normal, and all boys do it.<br>  <br>  Someday when you're masturbating, you'll get a "nice surprise."  The pleasurable sensations in your penis will build,. in much the same way as the urge to sneeze does, and you'll get the same sense of inevitability.  You'll tense up a little and the nice feeling will peak, and the muscles you use to clench your butt and move your erect penis up and down will kind of pulse for a while, about every 6/10 of a second, and this will be extremely pleasurable.  Afterwards, you'll feel relaxed all over, and probably want a nap.  This physiological response is called an "orgasm." <br>  <br>  Orgasm is how our bodies release sexual tension.  Once you experience an orgasm, you'll probably try to have one each time you masturbate.  As you get older, a white fluid called semen will be expelled from your penis when you orgasm.  This is called ejaculation.<br>  <br>  By the time you're through puberty, you'll be pretty good at giving yourself an orgasm and ejaculating by masturbating, and you'll know all about how your body works sexually, and be able to tell sexual partners what kind of touch and stimulation you find most enjoyable.<br>  <br>  All this is a normal part of growing up, and you shouldn't let anyone make you feel embarrassed or ashamed about it.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  .|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	An orgasm is when white stuff comes out.<br>  Masturbation is defined as manual stumulation of the tallywhacker to make white stuff come out.|`|q6hOg022aa	for girls and guys its the best feeling ever. u sumtimes get tibngly feelings guys get it after they bust a nut(ejaculate) girls when they about to squirt(ejaculate) but girls can keep going guys cant right away. masturbation is beating off( jacking off/hand job) masterbating girl is fingering, eating out (licking) and playing with clit. hope i helped|`|MUbbzN17aa	An orgasm is the result of stimulation overload that results in hightend sensations and the involuntary contractions of muscles in the groin area.

AA11020187	You have posted your question in the section for the United States and here we don’t care who you are or where you are from, if you are a patient in a hospital you will be treated well.
dpgXzMenaa	Here's what I would have answered if you'd asked *before* doing it for the first time...<br>  <br>  <br>  For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Oh, and "KAT"... "I hope it hurts you forever... etc."   You really are a truly sick f*ck for wishing endless pain on someone you've never even met.|`|28jjd7fgaa	It will stop hurting when you are comfortable with the person you are with and you can "loosen up". I wasn't ready the first time I had sex I got pressured into it.  It took me quite awhile to be able to trust my boyfriend (not the same guy) enough to be able to be comfortable enough to have sex without pain.|`|Yek5D2Chaa	ot depends on how wet u r. the wetter u r the less pain it is because its easier for him to enter you and his size has alot to do wit it. my advise it maybe play with urself a lil more often( with like dildos n stuff) jst so u can relax n losen ur vagina on ur own private time. that way u'll be ready for ur man whenever it come to it. or simply have more sex wit him but do let him know he needs to be gentle untill ur ok with what ever u both do.it migt take about 2-3 more times. pain will be less n less everytime. personally i went thru dat all with my man, he knew dat i was in a lil pain n he was very gentle about it. it was a great experience because they jst look so dam adorable how them try n care for u, not hurt u n satify ur needs in a sweet delicate way.....|`|xWyXbsw6aa	it hurt me about 5or so times after (obviously not as much though) everyone is different - just thought i should let you know my experience with my first time.<br>  <br>  wait a couple of days for the wound inside you to heal, and try again, <br>  <br>  don't worry - it will get good - i mean GOOD :)|`|DFZ3eZM1aa	probably just about 3-5 times before it stops hurting...<br>  just hang in there.<br>  trust me, once the pain goes away, the pleasure will be so great that you will be screaming and yelping and gasping for breathe...<br>  just wait it out, then thats when the fun begins...|`|idx3y0Azaa	Um, you have to have sex a couple more times before it starts feeling GOOD. Your vagina has to losen up first. Sorry hun, but atleast you'll have sex more. Good luck.|`|CtwGOAykaa	Just a few. Gotta get used to it, is all.|`|dXCjX2bFaa	this gave me a *****|`|BFkBjIByaa	Honestly it just depends on the girl. For me, it never hurt...ever, not even the first time. From what I've heard from a lot of my girl friends, it stops hurting after a few times. That seems to me to be the general answer. It could be totally different for you though, it could totally not hurt the next time you guys have sex or it could take a lot of times before it stops hurting. I know it's not the best answer in the world, but its true...it just depends on the girl|`|RV1bZjUKaa	It hurt me twice but not on the third time....but I only truly enjoyed it after a few more times. One has to know her body and her sexual needs to truly reach an orgasm...and once you have that knowledge, your sexual experience will be more blissful....<br>  <br>  It also depends upon your partner...some guys are more patient than others and will tend to put your needs satisfied first than theirs...|`|kMesQjEDaa	It depends if he went all the way in and u will know if he did cause the next time u all do it it wont be as bad I'm not saying it wont hurt but it wont be that bad give it a couple of try's like they say the third time is the charm|`|1hkHaxRIaa	Just relax.  If you are relaxed, your vagina is too.  Sometimes it hurts because you are too nervous and your vagina muscles contract.  Sometimes there is not enough moisture, so the penetration is more painful.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	it's different for everyone. some girls don't hurt at all, others have to do it over and over again before they start to enjoy it. just keep doing it and eventually it will be as enjoyable for you as it is for him.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Honestly, it depends. My first time hurt quite a lot, and so did the next few times. It still hurts for a while when he first enters, but it has gotten better. It's not going to be stellar right away, but keep at it because it does get better. Make sure that you are turned on (have him go down on you for a while before, but don't orgasm) and also use lube to ensure that you're wet enough.|`|jb9guNo3aa	Probably around 3-5 times. It didn't hurt for me at all, but I masturbated regularly already so it wasn't much of a problem. You just need to get loosened up a bit.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	that's not embarrassing.  And, it depends on each person.  It probably won't hurt as much next time. Hopefully it wont hurt at all.|`|35cOQFIDaa	there isn't any certain amount of times until it doesn't hurt. maybe you are just tense and thinking about the pain too much. just relax. ky might help.|`|AA11299079	the more you do it, the more fun it gets.
jGgOVd5Zaa	Looking at porn is a personal decision.  Porn used to be considered 'dirty' but it's become pretty mainstream.  The argument against porn was that it objectified women and there certainly are parts of the porn industry that mistreat women, but lots of women will also argue that posing naked empowers them.  Remember, a lot of what you look at in porn is airbrushed.  Porn can create unrealistic expectations.  Some people use porn to learn the basic mechanics of sex.  <br>  <br>  I think any harm it does is probably outweighed by the fact that it gets people talking about sex openly.  Just be really careful.  A lot of teens are getting in trouble for sending naked pictures to each other.  It's ok to have porn, but make sure everyone in it is legal age, even if you're not, and make sure you view porn only where appropriate.  I've met people who think it's fine to send naked pictures around at work;  There is a time and place for everything and school or work is not the appropriate place for porn.  Also, if you are looking at porn online, be very careful.  Lots of porn has computer viruses in it.<br>  <br>  You sound like a pretty normal kid, except maybe for having a girlfriend at 13.  Nice job!  Treat her well.  At 13 I was still mostly picking on girls.|`|0KGJRVMNaa	Is it bad to do it regularly? No.<br>  Is it bad to watch porn when you're 13?

The porn will ruin your sex life though. You'll start realizong it's all the same and you wont find any women very attractive.|`|Jm1M5j10aa	Well, you're a bit young to be looking at porn all of the time..

djs36Cl9aa	If they weren't done professionally, there is a chance that you struck an artery. Where exactly on the ears were they pierced? You should rub alcohol on them occasionally and turn the earring inside of the hole. It is normal for them to be hurting, but mine didn't bleed all that much. If they continue to bleed, you need to get medical help quickly. They could become infected, so if they are turning red and becoming swollen, you have to go to a doctor. It would also help to get earrings with gold posts - some people have trouble with other materials in their ears.|`|B3qjtZuRaa	It's not unusual for just-pierced earlobes to hurt and bleed a bit.  If they're hurting a LOT, however, I would see a doctor -- you may have an infection.|`|RPoFBenJaa	if they are bleeding still after a few days they are probably infected. Ask you doctor.|`|Ise5kFoxaa	They are probably infected, oh ya be careful with what you clean them it may infect them.|`|7xsJHSGTaa	lol you're fine. thats just what happens. keep taking care of them: rub an alcohol pad on each of your ears every night and DAB when they are bleeding|`|3p6fXiFpaa	This happened with me. At first when you get them pierced they may bleed. If they are bleeding a large amount tell a parent or get to the doctor. <br>  There is a possibility that you may be allergic to metals, this means that you need to switch to hypoallergenic earrings, or a gold/silver/platinum metal. You may want to consult a professional piercing expert (at a tattoo shop that has a degree in this is a good place to look) and ask them what they think as well. Most places like Clair's or Icing do not take proper care and testing when piercing ears and use cheaper materials, and studs.<br>  Continue to wash your piercing's with the solution's that you were given while following the directions as well.|`|zmxYEEhVaa	hey, <br>  I had the same problem so i bought a spray from the chemist and it really helped sooth the pain, when i asked the doctor he just said it was infected and there was no need to worry he also said it could simply just be an allergic reaction but when i used the spray it soothed down within about 10 minutes the spray is called "adnohr ear care antiseptic"<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!! and i hope your ears feel better!!|`|onfX2jqLaa	keep cleaning daily.<br>  if the bleeding happened after you moved around your earrings its normal because the skin tried to grow back and was pushed out of the way when it still hasnt healed completely. it will take a few weeks for the healing to be done and the pain to completely stop.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|n3g9j1dHaa	cleaning em too much can do it make sure you're not doin it too much. was it your cartledge or jsut your lobes? your lobes shouldnt be bleeding, mayeb you're just sensative. make sure your new earring backs are loose too, dont be scared you jsut go em pierced jsut make sure no puss comes out|`|VjDseED0aa	don't be scared it's normal. it'll go away in a few days. or if it's infected it'll go away in a week about. nothing to worry about|`|XmhYNlumaa	try applying pressure to stop the bleeding. after it stops bleeding clean it up and u should be good.|`|dWG3TVk8aa	Go to a clinic. Get it looked at. It may be infected.|`|tTaDBaM4aa	Call ask a nurse!!!!!!!|`|bWpYLSKSaa	They may be infected or were pierced badly. Search online for advice, or ask your friends and parents for help, because one of them will most likely have seen or gone through the same problem. Don't itch it or touch it, just put a tissue over the holes, making sure that they clot.|`|0krK45Reaa	it's perfectly normal! trust me, there's worse that can happen. just keep cleaning them, and if it gets really bad then call your doctor.|`|8gFujGXbaa	It's infected. Remove them immediately.|`|pd6hbk0saa	You might have to get them checked. They may be infected.

jb9guNo3aa	Those 3 people of 100 include people who had condoms break or slip off during sex. Also, studies have been done to prove that occasionally, even when the condom is entirely in tact and hasn't slipped, sometimes women still have a bit if semen residue in their vagina. I suppose one could still become pregnant from that, too, but it's not very likely at all.<br>  <br>  If you have sex 100 times, theoretically a pregnancy CAN occur, but the same is true if you have sex once with a condom. It's not a sure thing. That number basically says that out of 100 couples having sex with condoms, 3 of those couples will end up having one of the accidents mentioned above and become pregnant. Many people have sex hundreds of times using only condoms and don't end up pregnant. As long as you're careful with them, know how to use them (make sure no air is inside, hold the base when you pull out, pull out if it breaks, etc) then you should be safe. If it breaks or slips off, Plan B is available.<br>  <br>  Good for you for being responsible. :)|`|AUOp1j5Saa	Here's the brakes.<br>  <br>  Condoms are between 85-95% effective on average. Perfect use is about 95-98% effective.<br>  That means, over the course of an entire year, not 100 times having sex, you have a 2-5% of pregnancy if you do everything right. Unfortunately, the real chance is more like 5-15% since breaks, slips and leaks can occur.<br>  Combined with a little knowledge about a woman's ovulation time, the rate is extremely minimal.<br>  If you avoid sex when you are ovulating or right before you ovulate, the chances drop even lower.<br>  If you use spermicide, not spermicidal condoms mind you, on top of this, your chances go down even further.<br>  <br>  There's all kinds of things you can do to lower that 85-95% general use rate since not many people, especially those who are new to sex will use condoms perfectly.<br>  <br>  Also, another thing you need to know about condoms is to always check for leaks afterwards by squeezing the condom before you throw it away. This will let you know if there was a leak and allow you to purchase an emergency contraceptive in time to help eliminate the chances of pregnancy.

I'd assume that the more abortions one has, the less likely it is that they will be able to have children.|`|AUOp1j5Saa	It's very rare.<br>  Like everything else relating to abortion, zealots like to blow this point out of proportion.<br>  Occasionally, a poorly performed abortion will leave scaring on the uterine walls that can cause miscarriages in future pregnancies; however, this was much more common in decades gone by than it is now, unless the abortion was not performed properly by a proper medical doctor.<br>  Your friend's sister probably had a miscarriage, which isn't necessarily linked to the abortion. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of millions of women have miscarried without ever having an abortion, so unless her doctor told her "you will continue to miscarry because you had a shoddy abortion done", which I very highly doubt, then her miscarriage could be caused by any number of reasons.|`|tbESsT2daa	In the Soviet Union, and the Balkans during communist times when the Iron curtain was up, average women had multiple abortions (by average I mean married women, with children or without, not just teens who fucked around - which was punishable by death in certain communistic countries (teen sex)) they continued to become pregnant resulting in ever more abortions. Women in the balkans - had 11 or more abortions and still had children (since they kept getting pregnant)<br>  <br>  kimberley p is a complete dumbass. There were a lot more risks in the 60's-80's because abortion was illegal and was done in back ally places with a coathanger, in unsanitized places. Its true in America abortions just as ANY other medical procedure is bankable, because there is no national healthcare. So some doctors will try to make a profit - because hey they have to eat too. But there are other doctors in other fields ex plastic surgery that will do a shoddy job in a faster time to fit in other patients for more money. Usually though if done in a hospital they are performed by trained professionals. <br>  <br>  I live in Canada, where we have FREE national healthcare (paid for by all of our caring citizens through taxes). Abortions are free if you have a healthcard (and every canadian citizen, landed immigrant, and even refugees do) all you have to do is apply. My cousin had 6 abortions (3 with ex-bfs, 3 with her husband because she was still going through law school and had no time to have children). This was 8-9 years ago, and now she has 2 beautiful healthy daughters. Her abortions were performed in clinics with caring staff, were confidential and she had no complications in her surgery.<br>  <br>  Every womans body is different though. Good luck to your friend's sister.|`|Jxx30d5Raa	I know that many women have abortions and then have difficulty with miscarriages. Some abortions will damage the cervix which causes premature birth, others can scar the uterine lining causing the embryo to have improper implantation which results in spontaneous abortion aka miscarriage.<br>  <br>  The abortionists will not share this information with you because they are in the business of profit making. The abortion industry is a multi-million dollar a year business. They will not even acknowledge Post Abortion Syndrome, where women suffer emotional distress and depression following an abortion. Some women even become suicidal and have taken their lives.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abortionfacts.com/PAS/PAS.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.abortionfacts.com/PAS/PAS.asp</a>

Not all STD's show symptoms, and not all of them are prevented by a condom.<br>  <br>  Another reason is sort of an STD, but you can be high risk, but not actually have it.  It's called HPV (Human Papilloma Virus).  The statistics I read is that now, 85% of young sexually active women will contract it.  Most don't even know they have it until their gynecologist spots it.  It can actually go undetected for over 10 years (as it did for me) and can cause all sorts of problems.  Over the years, the doctors thought I'd had ectopic pregnancies, ovarian cysts, UTI's, allergic reactions to latex and spermicides, and problems with yeast infections.  Turns out, last year, they found that I was high risk HPV, most likely for the last ten years, and never knew it because I wasn't visiting the gynecologist the way I should have been.  Now, thanks to my ignorance, I've increased my risk of cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  These are just a few reasons.  Another would be that your gynecologist can sit and discuss birth control options with you a lot better than a teacher or parent can.  They know about all the latest options, and the positive and negative aspects of each.|`|gzpaMVnqaa	Once you become sexually active you can become exposed to different STD's. The main reason yearly gyne exams are recommended is that you can be exposed to the human papilloma virus (HPV), which has been shown to cause cervical cancer. The cervix is the opening from the uterus to the vagina. A gynecologist will take a sample of your cervical cells during an exam to check for any abnormalities that could indicate a pre-cancerous state. There is a vaccine available for the dangerous HPV strains.<br>  Other than that, women of sexual maturity are of the age where other gynecological issue might arise, so it is a good idea to get checked yearly.|`|lISrOzyraa	when you have sexual intercourse with someone then that means you're having sex with the person they have been with before.

AA11522944	6" is a good size for a Korean male.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ length of an erect ADULT penis is about 6" (15.2 cm).<br>  <br>  About 60% of all guys are between 5.5" (14 cm) and 6.5" (16.5 cm) and up to 90% of all guys are between 5” (12.7 cm) and 7” (17.7 cm). That’s only a 2” (5 cm) difference between 90% of ALL males.<br>  <br>  About 5% of guys are less that 5” (12.7 cm) and about 5% are more than 7” (17.7 cm). Less than 2% of guys are 8” (20.3 cm) or longer. <br>  <br>  See this link <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Penis_percentile.svg" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:...</a><br>  <br>  It’s worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6". <br>  <br>  There is no normal or average size for a soft (flaccid) penis because they vary enormously. Some guys ‘shrink’ a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ girth of an erect adult penis (that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point) is about 5" (12.7 cm).  Anywhere between 4.7” (11.9 cm) and 5.2” (13.2 cm) is normal.  <br>  <br>  Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18.  Remember that growth during puberty often happens in ‘spurts’ so don’t worry if you are a little behind at any particular point... you will probably catch up. Some guys claim that their penis continued to grow until they were in their early 20’s.<br>  <br>  Approximate erect lengths for under 18’s are:<br>  At the beginning of puberty          2.4” (6 cm)<br>  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0” (7.6 cm to 10.2 cm)<br>  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0” (10.2 cm to 12.7 cm)<br>  16 to 18 ....... 5.0" to 6.0” (12.7 cm to 15.2 cm)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.free-condom-stuff.com/education/research.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-condom-stuff.com/educati...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sizesurvey.com/result.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sizesurvey.com/result.html</a><br>  <a href="http://sexuality.about.com/od/anatomyresponse/a/average_penis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sexuality.about.com/od/anatomyres...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mattersofsize.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28793" rel="nofollow">http://www.mattersofsize.com/forum/showt...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...</a>|`|AA10344737	Asians have a poor rap for penis size and are often joked about for having "small penises".  <br>  <br>  In all actuality, you fall in the 'average' size, which is 6.2".

Acnxwdrpaa	Just becasue you weight that much and your friends weigh 70-90 pounds doesn't mean you are fat. you could have more muscle, or your organs can weigh more.<br>  <br>  but if you really really want to lose the weight, go on a diet. just run every day, and eat less. i mean, still ehat breakfast lunch and dinner, but don't eat as much snaks. and eat dinner before 5 o'clock|`|8SRjELNBaa	sounds like your eating the right food... veggies! Just reduce your calorie intake by 500. (Caculate your BMR first)|`|zQiYKgMLaa	be careful with the carrots, they're really high in sugar.<br>  <br>  Well, first thing you're gonna have to do is stop eating out so often.  Restraunts serve ridiculously fattening food and insanely large portions.  You really have to not only choose healthy choices from the menus, but then you ahve to have the will power to only eat the proper portion size and take the rest home.  Good advice would be to cut the meal in half and move half of it to one side of the plate and ask for a doggie bag for it.<br>  <br>  You need to get out there and exercise.  Try to make sure you join a sport every season (ex: Cross Country in the Fall, Swimming in the Winter, and Track in the Spring)  This will help you get your exercise in.  You need to make sure you're eating lean protein, good fats, and only complex carbohydrates with each meal and that you have you calories at the appropriate level.<br>  <br>  You can't obsess over this though, you're only 12.  At 12, your body is going through all kinds of crazy things.  My sister was a pretty fat 12 year old, but she hit puberty and a growth spurt and was a really skinny 14 year old.

Also startin eating fish because it is high in potassium and low in fat meaning you are geting filled by less and you are geting benifits of it<br>  <br>  ...se if anyoune elso wants to lose wight like you do and you can do it together making it a compettion.<br>  <br>  HOPE That can help you get started and good luck<br>  <br>  Cheers
F9Ll7oLJaa	if you have doubt of malaria( fever with cold even in hottest wether is indication of malaria )get blood tested and if found positive go to your physician immedietly and he will give you medicine course for the number of days he think fit .You can take with this the side treatment which do not have any side effects like basil tea and mahasudursan churna which will support to cure malaria|`|cWuumdy7aa	There are several families of drugs used to treat malaria. Chloroquine is very cheap and, until recently, was very effective, which made it the antimalarial drug of choice for many years in most parts of the world. However, resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine has spread recently from Asia to Africa, making the drug ineffective against the most dangerous Plasmodium strain in many affected regions of the world. In those areas where chloroquine is still effective it remains the first choice. Unfortunately, chloroquine-resistance is associated with reduced sensitivity to other drugs such as quinine and amodiaquine.<br>  <br>  There are several other substances which are used for treatment and, partially, for prevention (prophylaxis). Many drugs may be used for both purposes; larger doses are used to treat cases of malaria. Their deployment depends mainly on the frequency of resistant parasites in the area where the drug is used. One drug currently[update] being investigated for possible use as an anti-malarial, especially for treatment of drug-resistant strains, is the beta blocker propranolol. Propranolol has been shown to block both Plasmodium's ability to enter red blood cell and establish an infection, as well as parasite replication. A December 2006 study by Northwestern University researchers suggested that propranolol may reduce the dosages required for existing drugs to be effective against P. falciparum by 5- to 10-fold, suggesting a role in combination therapies.<br>  <br>  Currently available anti-malarial drugs include:<br>  <br>  Artemether-lumefantrine (Therapy only, commercial names Coartem and Riamet) <br>  Artesunate-amodiaquine (Therapy only) <br>  Artesunate-mefloquine (Therapy only) <br>  Artesunate-Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Therapy only) <br>  Atovaquone-proguanil, trade name Malarone (Therapy and prophylaxis) <br>  Quinine (Therapy only) <br>  Chloroquine (Therapy and prophylaxis; usefulness now reduced due to resistance) <br>  Cotrifazid (Therapy and prophylaxis) <br>  Doxycycline (Therapy and prophylaxis) <br>  Mefloquine, trade name Lariam (Therapy and prophylaxis) <br>  Primaquine (Therapy in P. vivax and P. ovale only; not for prophylaxis) <br>  Proguanil (Prophylaxis only) <br>  Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Therapy; prophylaxis for semi-immune pregnant women in endemic countries as "Intermittent Preventive Treatment" - IPT) <br>  Hydroxychloroquine, trade name Plaquenil (Therapy and prophylaxis) <br>  The development of drugs was facilitated when Plasmodium falciparum was successfully cultured.[78] This allowed in vitro testing of new drug candidates.<br>  <br>  Extracts of the plant Artemisia annua, containing the compound artemisinin or semi-synthetic derivatives (a substance unrelated to quinine), offer over 90% efficacy rates, but their supply is not meeting demand. In 2007, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation contributed $13.6m to support research at the University of York to develop fast and high-yield strains of artemisia, with researchers predicting an increase in yield of up to 1000% compared to current varieties.One study in Rwanda showed that children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria demonstrated fewer clinical and parasitological failures on post-treatment day 28 when amodiaquine was combined with artesunate, rather than administered alone (OR = 0.34). However, increased resistance to amodiaquine during this study period was also noted.[81] Since 2001 the World Health Organization has recommended using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in areas experiencing resistance to older medications. The most recent WHO treatment guidelines for malaria recommend four different ACTs. While numerous countries, including most African nations, have adopted the change in their official malaria treatment policies, cost remains a major barrier to ACT implementation. Because ACTs cost up to twenty times as much as older medications, they remain unaffordable in many malaria-endemic countries. The molecular target of artemisinin is controversial, although recent studies suggest that SERCA, a calcium pump in the endoplasmic reticulum may be associated with artemisinin resistance. Malaria parasites can develop resistance to artemisinin and resistance can be produced by mutation of SERCA.However, other studies suggest the mitochondrion is the major target for artemisinin and its analogs.<br>  <br>  In February 2002, the journal Science and other press outletsannounced progress on a new treatment for infected individuals. A team of French and South African researchers had identified a new drug they were calling "G25". It cured malaria in test primates by blocking the ability of the parasite to copy itself within the red blood cells of its victims. In 2005 the same team of researchers published their research on achieving an oral form, which they refer to as "TE3" or "te3". As of early 2006, there is no information in the mainstream press as to when this family of drugs will become commercially available.<br>  <br>  In|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Antimalarial drugs...yes there is such a thing.|`|ErDuBUvWaa	Hi,<br>  Treatment for malaria is possible, you can try anti-malaria drugs available in the market.

6YnwXCIaaa	If it's a walk-in clinic (not an emergency room), this would be appropriate if you can't get a doctor's appointment in a reasonable amount of time.  It would also give the doctor a chance to assess you to make sure other things aren't going on.<br>  <br>  Things to try to know for the doctor:  when it started, what symptoms you've had, how it's changed since it's started, what you've tried to take for it and how it worked, what makes it worse, if you've ever had it before, whether you have been diagnosed with GERD in the past, any heart or lung problems you might have, etc.|`|0rpN2419aa	Sorry to hear that you are suffering from GERD.  I have it too and it is quite uncomfortable.  My muscles don't hurt with it though, just the tummy and the esophagus.  Make sure when you go to the clinic you tell the Dr. all the symptoms you have, but don't tell him you have GERD, or he might just assume that you already know what it is, and he or she might put you on the wrong treatment if it is something else.  <br>  GERD is not a minor illness and it needs to be treated so that you will be more comfortable.<br>  I hope that you get diagnosed soon so that you can start feelng better soon.  There are over the counter medicines to treat GERD, but do not take them until you have been diagnosed.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	There's nothing minor about GERD.  I'm a daily sufferer, too.  Start taking prilosec daily and it should go away.  That's all my doc told me to do.  You can buy it over the counter.  If you don't do something about it soon, the acid in your stomach will eat away your esophagus and cause worse problems than heartburn.<br>  <br>  I  think it's about $25 for 45 pills.|`|onfX2jqLaa	no not at all gastroreflux can be a really serious problem for some people when it gets worse and starts controlling peoples lives<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  i hate acid reflux!|`|334692f04804c7bac20cc6675990f7c5aa	GERD is short for gastrointestinal esophogeal reflux disease..the operative word  her being disease.  It is a physical illness which if left unchecked could cause damage to your esophagus by burning away it's lining which will leave you with an erosion which is a  much bigger medical problem than you have now or want.  Injuries to inner tissues like this can lead to other more serious medical problems.  <br>  <br>  This is NOT a minor problem and the sooner you go the sooner you shall be on the road to recovery.  I made my husband go to the doctor for this and he was helped considerably. His esophageal tract was already damaged from the acid build up.<br>  <br>  When I had this, I went to a ND, a naturapathic doctor and they simply made me stop drinking tea as it was a reaction from the tanic acid in tea, and had me use a homeopathic remedy to calm down my stomach. I have not had this problem in years.  An MD will most likely advise you go on something which stops all the acid.  I did not want to do that.  My husband is still on his GERD meds after over twenty years and I take none. <br>  <br>   Where ever you go please just go and the doctor will be able to ask you questions to help you sufficiently describe your symptoms.<br>  <br>  I wish you much success. I have faith in you.<br>  <br>  May I also suggest you check out the supplement tumeric.  My ND started me on this, and it is wonderful for helping a  fussy digestive system work better.  It also aids me in keeping away from the GERD.  Even one cup of tea still gets the reflux going.  Have you ever tried eliminating anything from your diet.

The fitness machines can measure this though<br>  <br>  So my advice is to really hammer out in the gym with a training regime, work towards you goal, AND EAT food obvoulsly healthy food like weight watchers food or things low in carbs.<br>  <br>  Not Eating, alone won;t change your weight it will mke you unhealthy<br>  <br>  And contact a dietician and fitness director for more helpful tips on this and chounselling may be good for you to if yo have those thoughts they can really help and lift up your ovearall well being<br>  <br>  Really hope you achive your goal..."imposible is nothing" i used to have a similar problem to you but i worked towards the goal and now that Ive achived that goal it has opned up new things for me<br>  <br>  Cheers and good luck
loqsl5xXaa	you can work in a hospital and a medical office. The chores/duties are varied. Usually it's the simpler things like taking vitals, doing sugar (for diabetics) cks, bed pans, changing clothes, bedding, etc.. but like i said sometimes it depends on what department you will be in. Pay def. changes with the state, city and hospital. all hospitals do have part time benefits. it just depends on the hospital what they offer and how long you have to wait to get them. <br>  <br>  Good luck and try to have fun!|`|wLWgCRFcaa	It depends upon the hiring policy of the facility.  <br>  Here is a website all about the training, work and pay of CNAs.  <br>  I agree with Steve, CNAs don't get paid much, and you will be doing mostly custodial work wherever you work.  You might want to consider staying in school longer and becoming a LPN or RN. <br>  Good luck!|`|9YQoQNijaa	Yes, there are many positions available out there for CNA's.  You would pretty much be doing all the dirty work (aka. bed pans, bathing, colostemy bag changing) for the LPN's or RN"s.  Duties are pretty much the same and the rate obviously depends on where you live and the cost of living.  In KY CNA's make about 12 dollars to start out.  Benefits I would not expect part time.  Better to stay in school and become a LPN atleast.

4GNNOQeLaa	As far as health coverage goes they are probably very similar the only difference is that an HMO is more restrictive on what doctors you can go to.  If you go to a Doctor or hospital that is outside your HMO then you will have to pay more or all of the expense.  A PPO gives you more freedom to go where you want, but it usually costs more.|`|eYamLXo3aa	Health Maintenance Organizations are generally more affordable than other managed care insurance systems. The monthly fees and co-payments are usually not high and are an affordable alternative to paying a percentage of the bill like other managed care providers require. But HMOs are ""prevention"" focused. That means they promote ways to stay healthy rather than ways to treat illness. HMOs only cover members if they visit doctors within the HMO insurer network. If there's a specialist a member wants to see for a specific ailment and the physician is not in the HMO network, the member will have to pay out-of-pocket expenses.<br>  <br>  Preferred Provider Organizations offer more freedom and choices than other managed care insurance systems. Even if members go out-of-network for their medical needs, they are still covered to a certain degree.  But Preferred Provider Organizations can be more costly to plan members. Since PPOs involve a deductible, PPO members often pay more out-of-pocket expenses for their coverage, depending on the specific medical services a member needs throughout the year.

I had cleaned it and had done everything the piercer recommended.  It turns out that I'm just allergic to all piercings, metal AND plastic.  This could be your problem too.  Do you have any other piercings?|`|WSdAjGxvaa	It sounds infected. Continue cleaning your piercing - you should use this:<br>  <br>  1. Packaged sterile saline solution with no additives (read the label), or a non-iodized sea salt mixture: Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized (iodine-free) sea salt into one cup (8 oz) of warm distilled or bottled water. A stronger mixture is not better; a saline solution that is too strong can irritate your piercing.<br>  2. A mild, fragrance-free liquid soap—preferably anti-microbial or germicidal.<br>  <br>  Use the saline soak once or more a day for 5-10 minutes. Soap no more than 1-2 times a day. For minor infections, increase the frequency of mild saline soaks; for more severe infections see a physician. The saline soaks and mild soap should take care of the "blood bubble," it will just take time - it might be tempting to try and pop it but don't do it, this is an invitation to more bacteria. Under NO circumstance should you remove the jewelry - the jewelry acts as a drain and removing it can trap the infection inside your body and cause an abscess. <br>  <br>  Also do not use ointments, e.g. neosporin, that are petroleum based because they are difficult to wash from your piercing and can prevent necessary air circulation.<br>  <br>  Make sure your jewelry is quality grade - stainless steel and titanium are both good. To the person who said they were allergic to jewelry: have you tried titanium?<br>  <br>  Lots more useful info here: <br>  <a href="http://safepiercing.org/" rel="nofollow">http://safepiercing.org/</a><br>  <br>  Check the Troubleshooting and Getting Pierced > Body Aftercare sections.

Realizing I am 40 and have had 4 children...My weight loss would be way different then yours....<br>  <br>  But here is what I did;<br>  Breakfast - Instant oatmeal (Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar) plus a piece of fruit - apple, orange, melon or a cup of berries. On weekends, I would have a couple pieces of toast and a boiled or scrambled egg. <br>  <br>  Snack - piece of fruit or a small salad about 11 a.m. (and I love dressing so I had some on it, not too much though)<br>  <br>  Lunch - A sandwich - 2 pieces of bread with lettuce or alfalfa sprouts, mustard, 2 low fat turkey or chicken slices, tomato and cucumber slices. And a piece of fruit or some raw veggies and dip. Sometimes I would have homemade veggie soup instead of a sandwich, or just a large veggie salad.<br>  <br>  Snack - fruit or veggie sticks again<br>  <br>  Dinner - small piece of meat 2 to 3 ounces. A potato with light sour cream (no butter) and veggies. Lots of veggies to fill me up. A salad before a meal is good too!<br>  <br>  I would snack on some grapes or berries or apple slices at night if I wanted some munchie food.<br>  <br>  And I drank lots of water as well. About 8 full glasses a day. I got a large container and filled it with water and took to work everyday. I made sure I drank it all by the time I went to bed. <br>  <br>  Also you need to get yourself active if you aren`t. Walk around the block or take the stairs instead of the elevator etc. Any little bit helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I am still losing weight and hope to keep up healthy eating forever!
f4e89595d8a00252b0e37dcd7670e690aa	My teeth are pretty sensitive but I have a lot of experience with whitening so here's what I've found out...<br>  Whitening with over-the-counter products is becoming more effective but by far the most effective way is in-office whitening with your dentist.  For one thing, the dentist will be able to avoid getting the bleach on your gums which solves half your problem right there.  Or, if you opt to take home trays then I recommend using only the minimum amount of bleach to fill each reservoir.  That prevents the bleach from extruding onto your gums when you place the tray in.  I have found that most of the sensitivity comes when the bleach makes contact with your gums.  The trays you can get in stores cannot prevent this from happening--so avoid these if you can.<br>  Another thing you can get from your dentist is a desensitizer that you can put in the tray and wear when you're not bleaching.  This really helps.<br>  Finally, get some toothpaste for sensitive teeth, like Sensodyne.  It has potassium nitrate in it which reduces the sensitivity of the nerves in your teeth.  That does make a big difference.|`|a1pmr73vaa	the best teeth whitening system out on the market is called GoSMile. It comes in these little ampoules and each contains pure hydrogen peroxide which has been vaccum sealed. The whole treatment is like 80 bucks and it whitens about 10 shades. Its amazing.

You wont have any sensitivity with it and its comparable to what you would get in the dentist office.|`|CD0JesQeaa	There is a new product out (I just saw the commercial earlier) for a whitening kit for people with sensitive teeth.

She needs to talk it out of her.Then try to calm her by gradually talking about real and safe things. When she brings up the dream again, which she will in the next minute probably, try to get her to think of a different ending to the dream.

K1UicE7kaa	That is klonopin (Clonazepam) which is a benzodiazepine drug used as an anticonvulsant.  They are two different catagories of drugs that both potentiate the effects of the other...esp. respiratory depression  Both happen to depress respirations and can drop blood pressure, cause you to aspirate on your vomitus while you are asleep, wreck a car (killing self and others)... etc. etc. if taken together... Obviously a doctor is not prescribing you to take this.  If you do not believe me call a pharmacist. <br>  <br>  You will probably find some druggie to tell you you can...just remember that. <br>  <br>  There might be some unusual circumstances in a hospital setting...but, you have people evaluating and checking your vital signs or watching your oxygen saturation, and cardiac monitor.  Both drugs are addictive.  If you are feeling that bad... you need to see a doctor and not treat yourself.  You could end up dead or brain damaged if you become hypoxic from taking both at the same time|`|hFpchZ1saa	This is def an answer for your doc! or any doc over the fone they dont need to know if your a patient of theirs just incase those were not perscribed lol<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuHgpAcWklkWiiwhnZCumjzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309221037AAz7M3D">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZBwmdm0qaa	Combining downers can have unpredictable side effects. This combination is not inherently toxic or anything though. It is not as risky as combining benzos with other benzos, or benzos with alcohol.<br>  <br>  However, there is always a risk, with depressant drugs, of respiratory depression (where you stop breathing).<br>  <br>  Even if you have experience with both drugs, they may act unpredictably in combination.<br>  <br>  The relatively safe way to do something like this would be to combine small amounts of both first on one occasion to make sure you don't have some bizarre reaction.<br>  <br>  Your doctor won't be able to tell you anything better than that.

iK3YYRaTaa	First of all , a good diet. Low in carbs high in protein and lots of veggies. Fruit in moderation. <br>  A low Glycemic diet is in order. Here is a website with 2,480 food listed. Its easy to understand. <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm</a><br>  <br>  The glycemic index (GI) is a numerical system of measuring how much of a rise in circulating blood sugar a carbohydrate triggers–the higher the number, the greater the blood sugar response. So a low GI food will cause a small rise, while a high GI food will trigger a dramatic spike. A list of carbohydrates with their glycemic values is shown below. A GI is 70 or more is high, a GI of 56 to 69 inclusive is medium, and a GI of 55 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  The glycemic load (GL) is a relatively new way to assess the impact of carbohydrate consumption that takes the glycemic index into account, but gives a fuller picture than does glycemic index alone. A GI value tells you only how rapidly a particular carbohydrate turns into sugar. It doesn't tell you how much of that carbohydrate is in a serving of a particular food. You need to know both things to understand a food's effect on blood sugar. That is where glycemic load comes in. The carbohydrate in watermelon, for example, has a high GI. But there isn't a lot of it, so watermelon's glycemic load is relatively low. A GL of 20 or more is high, a GL of 11 to 19 inclusive is medium, and a GL of 10 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  Foods that have a low GL almost always have a low GI. Foods with an intermediate or high GL range from very low to very high GI.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both GI and GL are listed here. The GI is of foods based on the glucose index–where glucose is set to equal 100. The other is the glycemic load, which is the glycemic index divided by 100 multiplied by its available carbohydrate content (i.e. carbohydrates minus fiber) in grams. (The "Serve size (g)" column is the serving size in grams for calculating the glycemic load; for simplicity of presentation I have left out an intermediate column that shows the available carbohydrates in the stated serving sizes.) Take, watermelon as an example of calculating glycemic load. Its glycemic index is pretty high, about 72. According to the calculations by the people at the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, in a serving of 120 grams it has 6 grams of available carbohydrate per serving, so its glycemic load is pretty low, 72/100*6=4.32, rounded to 4.<br>  <br>  And don't forget exercise is as important as your meds. Walk at least 30 minutes a day. Nordic Walking is great. Builds up upper body as well as the lower. <br>  Use ? to ? teaspoon of cinnamon per day. Add it to your coffee, oatmeal, smoothie, or wherever you find it palatable.  <br>  If you already suffer from diabetes, be sure to stay on a regular schedule with your cinnamon usage so that your blood sugar levels don't yo-yo.Use the same amount at the same time every day so that you can get a sense of how cinnamon affects your own personal blood sugar readings. <br>  Use the powdered spice or a cinnamon stick.  Cinnamon pills are also available, and can be found easily via an online search. MHCP is water soluble and is not found in cinnamon oil. <br>  <br>  Lime and lemon juice delay the digestion of starches as does vinegar. I've found that 2-3 tablespoons of lime or lemon juice reduces my post prandial BG response by 10-20 points. Rick Mendosa's site has a lot of material on acids in the diet.

A glucose meter is the most important device that a diabetic should carry. You need to talk to a doctor-make sure he knows your situation. It all depends on type 1 or 2 diabetes. Type 2 can SOMETIMES be "cured" if you loose weight and watch EVERYTHING you eat. Type 1 is insulin dependent. YOu should check your blood sugar before and after you eat to make sure you are regulated. I was careless in high school and now I have neuropathy because my diabetes was not regulated-now it's hard for me to control it at all. Anyway, make sure you know what foods is good for you to eat, cut back on carbs and sweets for sure, watch your fruit intake because it can raise your sugar, but they are still better than candy bars! Make sure you have an exercise rutiune, maybe light exercises every day. Do not skip meals, do not over eat. Depends on the type, you just need to regulate and live accordingly. Watch for infections on the feet-diabetics don't have very good healing anywhere, and tell the doctor if your sight is going, seeing red spots, or "floaters" All in all, just make sure you keep regulated. Good luck!|`|ylmg0ThIaa	Drink juice of flower of Cactus which is red in color. pl. visit the link to see the appearance of the fruit<br>  <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/1ds-4/prickly-pear-cactus-flowering.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/1ds-4/prick...</a><br>  Important first consult doctor for the same|`|CQww1c2daa	Either medication, diet or insulin.

The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  Pills don't work because all they do is increase the blood flow, not the amount the chambers can hold. At best all they'll do is give you harder erections.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.|`|ANhYfjNQaa	Devices and pills available at the market are really harmful to the body. Penis pump can make your penis bigger for a short <br>  period of time but it is not recommended. Some of the natural techniques are really helpful to increase penis size. <br>  Penis Advantage is a very popular program for penis enlargement.It worked for me.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|Rt0thbfwaa	on man-swers a doctor was saying the only way to enlarge without medication is surgery. there is like 4 - 6 inches i think he said in your gooch. lol and all they do is cut you open and pull it out a lil and sew you back up.|`|zRI0tLd8aa	You can't, and you shouldn't want to even with medication. Be happy with what you have.
YtRB9Mhtaa	You're fine.  Find a girl, fall in love with her, and enjoy the way you were made.  Every man is a little different; any woman should be able to respect that...|`|TsjqzanQaa	If you have normal function, there's nothing that really can be done.<br>  <br>  Unless you're really overweight, you may have a buried penis, and this shouldn't be harmful to you.<br>  <br>  It may look odd, but as long as you don't have pain, and it functions normally, there really isn't a problem.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Your Answer:<br>  Nothing you can do about it. You do still have at least 4 more years of puberty left & things could improve during that time - but there are no guarantee's. You just have to play the cards your dealt - and get on with the rest of your life.|`|TMN21iHJaa	hi there thats what its like for me as well and im 16. do you have a email address? i just want to ask you something similar but dont realy want to say on here lol.|`|hFSmjI6yaa	You may have a vagina! call ur local doctor!
Fjp12f8laa	well it would depend on how you feel<br>  <br>  if your tired and sore then maybe you are working to hard, but if you love it and your not exhausted then why stop, i say live life and do what you want.<br>  <br>  keep in mind that recommend minimum is 30 mins a day so up to you really|`|bf6K6uubaa	depends on your age but 5 days a week of doing that sounds fine...you'd know if you were over doing it if it hurts when you're done..and i dont mean kinda sore i mean actual pain|`|40c2dd53f8275fb6c6f6e563c70a669eaa	I think you should rest a least once during the week. If you don't feel any pains or strains on the body, you should be fine. Make sure you properly warm up and stretch. And of course, drink lots of fluids.|`|04d6651ebec3cf813f57a13eb4a152bbaa	it depends on how your body feels. make sure you do ur pre-workout and post-workout stretches, consume lots of protein, and a good amount of carbohydrates after swimming practice.
8bQkJ2Zjaa	Sometimes, it is the same in my case especially. I have been a diabetic most of my life, and I bruise easily as well. Sometimes it doesn't really have anything to do with it, it could just be the sensitivity of your skin. But I am not a doctor, but I want you to know that it happens to me too. One time a lady bumped into me at walmart and I got a huge bruise on my shoulder. And small cuts or scrapes last forever because my body finds it rough to fight infection. Again, you shouldn't be worried about it too much. I would call a doctor if it is really on your mind|`|HUrLVofYaa	From what I've just read, diabetics tend to heal slower and can be prone to more bruising. I'm not really certain of all the reasons involved though.|`|57427bff834897309d1cf3dcaf5f7635aa	Diabetes per se does not increase brusing.  Are you on aspirin, coumadin or plavix?   If not, see your doctor to make sure not underlying blood count or liver issues.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	You should speak to your endocrinologist about this - a lot of bruising is not a typical problem of diabetics, tha tis why noting came up on your Google search.  You may have another issue such as von Willebrands disease or something that is separate and distinct from diabetes.
CXrXum40aa	It is unlikely, but it depends on how you landed on your tail bone, normal it would break if too much pressure is applied but you tail bone is connected to your spine therefore it maybe possible but i highly doubt it|`|vLzLk4m0aa	i would think so because its connected to your spine!!

The sperm and egg meet in the uterus.|`|pTKvMD1Iaa	Since your too lazy to do your own homework..<br>  <br>  The eggs sit in the ovaries, they are released down the fallopean tubes and are released into the uterus, they sit here for an amount of time where they are meeted by the sperm (during intercourse) - the woman can then become pregnant, it will then start to grow and develop into an embryo, then a feutus, then a baby. If the woman is not impregnated, the egg will further be released (has her period) the egg is released amongst the uterus's lining. Once the period is over the cycle then begins to start again.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|HUrLVofYaa	Why do kids ask strangers to do their homework for them here? <br>  <br>  CHECK YOUR TEXTBOOOK.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	The egg develops in the ovary, usually one each month will be released and start down the fallopian tube toward the uterus.  If the woman has unprotected sex  at this time, called ovulation, and one sperm manages to penetrate the egg while in the tube, the fertilized egg will proceed down the tube into the uterus and implant in the lining of the uterus.  If the egg is not fertilized, it will not implant and will be expelled during menstruation about two weeks later.  The first week of pregnancy begins when the egg becomes fertilized and a human's gestational time is about 40 weeks to delivery.  If two or more eggs are released and they all become fertilized, the woman could have multiple birth, but not identical babies.  If the one egg splits after fertilization into more than one fetus, the woman could have identical babies.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..
erXY47kNaa	yea its cool i workout similar to you and ive noticed good results. it would be cool to go back and do the treadmill you can do cardio up to 3 times a day but only lift once a day. o and stretching is very important dude trust me.. i got back problems because i never stretched so stretch out before you work out trust me man its a must or you will run into problems later.|`|zSkC7hsGaa	You are seriously overtaining! One weight training session a day is plenty. do it before the cardio.<br>   If you don't have the money for a trainer buy a good book on bodybuilding and weight training Arnold Schwarzenegger's encyclopedia of bodybuilding is the best, but Golds gym workout book is also good. check amazon for the best price.<br>   Stretching is done between sets of each exercise stretch that muscle group as you do your workout out.<br>   The sauna and steam room are a good way to relax after your work out. Don't go back to the weights again, once is enough.

cVPIH22kaa	I think yes.. because sometimes it could be your other teeth putting pressure on the wisdom or the gum could be swollen...I think you should have a dentist check it out before it could hurt even more.  That's what i did when my face began swelling up and I couldn't stand the pain.  The dentist will either give u antibiotic to heal the pain so that your wisdom teeth can fully develop.  If you don't need that wisdom teeth then you should take it out.  Later it will be very hard to clean and sooner or later it will be decay and eventually you'll have to get it out.  I already have 2 remove last year and it didn't hurt AT ALL.  Talk to your dentist to see what recommendations they give you...goodluck :)|`|90LFCYxTaa	yes it is but 30 mins before you go to bed take an advil|`|a1pmr73vaa	Normal since,you have pressure on the tooth and the best is to lay up not on your sides where it hurts..I know teeth paid..I had pain on my root canals that even made me cry for real..and they still hurt like hell..Take advil or otc medicine and ask the dentist for a follow up on strong stuff if that does not work..<br>  <br>  I get refills all the time for my pain medication for my teeth.

X1YVUA5oaa	Sounds like you're doing really good. I used to weigh more than you do now, and I'm 5'9'', about 170 now.  I'm not sure if you can lose 30 by May but I think 20 is realistic if you're watching you're calories.  You may want to increase your speed when you're jogging or do 1/4 mile speed bursts.  Eventually you'll become even stronger and be able to burn more calories in the same amount of time, it's just a numbers game really. Try to get to the point where you can do 3 miles in a half hour, or 5.5 miles in an hour. If you still feel like doing more like I do sometimes on a nice day, you can walk for another half hour after you're done jogging. If you're body feels like it needs rest from jogging you can find hills to walk up or walk on a treadmill with the incline raised to simulate a hill, this burns a lot of calories even walking, increases your endurance, and will help with you're jogging as well.

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|I82XZNp7aa	There's no "quick fix" for cutting weight.<br>  <br>  You need to change your lifestyle and eating habits. For example, do special exercises to tone down some areas of your body. (Ex. swimming tones your legs). Eat leafy vegetables instead of always starches, because starch are the energy reservoirs for plants, and once it's in you, it probably will be broken down into fat.<br>  <br>  You should also check your BMI (Body mass Index) and see if you're ideal. If you are, then do not diet. If you're overweight, consult a professional. Over half of the diets people prescribe for themselves leave them in worse conditions than before, so to save time, talk to a dietician, nutritionist, doctor, etc and see what they think.<br>  <br>  If you are more on the heavily built side, then I'm afraid you'll have to live with it. No matter how much you exercise and diet, you will never have the Megan Fox body. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, to keep yourself to an ideal weight, get enough sleep (so your body can replenish itself) and drink lots of water!|`|XKhNw221aa	there is no fast way to lose weight. what i did was only ate a big breakfast(that was the only thing I ate all day) I ran for about an 1 1/2 hrs a day, 1 in the morning before breakfast and 1/2 before dark. Then I'd spend about an hour lifting, then other hour practicing(Muay Thai). I lost about 30lbs in 5 months but I would have lost more if not for the gain in muscle. So just cut out the lifting and practicing.|`|ppX0xoeFaa	No sleep,no drink,no eat,walking is the way.|`|s5Ey0F5taa	Do cardio, more specifically, sprint-jogs have been proven to burn 3x the amount of energy (fat) than normal running.  The only time you should just run is if you're participating in a marathon, do sprint-jogs to lose weight.  Sprint for the longer part of a track, the straight away, and then on the curves, take it down to a light walk and then sprint again for the straight away.  This will make your heart burn fat extremely fast and just keep repeating until tired but push yourself!  <br>  <br>  And change your diet, no more fast food or going out to eat.  Dining out has tons of sodium and fats your body doesn't need.|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	drink water (w/ lemon if u dont mind it) , some detox teas are good, eat healthy and in proper portions, and be active - go for walks, work out if u can, sounds simple but its the most effective and healthy way to lose weight, all of those diet pills and drinks etc mess with your body, when all you have to do is work with your body|`|G38ltd04aa	Losing weight too fast will not do anything in the long run, you'll gain it all back and then some.<br>  <br>  Lose it the right way...<br>  <br>  Exercise and eat well..<br>  <br>  Don't buy into all the hype, or the latest fads...it's very simple...less calories in, more calories out.<br>  <br>  Even if you diet constantly, and then sit on our butt all day, it won't work.|`|BStVMhUQaa	after you eat dinner, walk for an hour. it will get you active and you'll burn the calories that you consumed during dinner. it will relax you and relieve a lot of the stress you've felt during the day which will help you lose weight too.|`|vAxRlZgKaa	The easiest way to lose weight is to lose it with someone help.

TMN21iHJaa	i had the same problem about a month or two ago just go have a shower and wash it then go and put some lotion on but dont **** for a day or to if possible|`|0LLekEuXaa	like your hole is getting bigger or the skin is peeling?<br>  <br>  needs to be moistened and lubricated more... kinda like dry skin on your hands. ---> that was if it was peeling.<br>  i dont know about the other, if it is, just dont be as rough!|`|K0ONeDR0aa	my boyfriend's penis peels sometimes after he goes tanning... just moisturize it lol.|`|E64juLwJaa	Use some baby oil on it :it is dehydrated:the skin.<br>  Use lubes when you masturbate and use less force:both can cause this<br>  Colors|`|a1pmr73vaa	gosh..good god! get some baby oil and run it so it won't keep peeling your ashy as heck lol.
aIZfiU6Kaa	It's a type of cyst and it's called a ganglion, it's a build up synovial fluid which usually lubricates joints  between the tendon that operates your fingers and the sheath that surrounds it and it's quite harmless.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they just disappear as mysteriously as they arrive, the original remedy suggested a smack with the familly bible but any similar pressure will release the fluid without any after effects.<br>  <br>  If it becomes paiflull or your worried about it you should see your doctor to confirm that it is a ganglion, in rare cases they can be removed surgically.|`|AA12050428	See the Dr. any lumps ought to be investigated but it is probably just fatty tissue I have a few in my arms but only small, they have been there years.|`|kykmpr0Caa	my niece had similar to this comeup just past her elbow, it didnt hurt or anything, didnt seem to grow which ruled out a cyst. it was 2 years before the doctor decided to have an mri scan done on it, it was found to be a non cancerous tumor which had attached itself to the muscle in her arm. she had surgery to remove it the day after boxing day last year, was in hospital just for the day, then home that night. <br>  <br>  she is absolutely fine now, had another scan just to make sure it hadnt comeback but nope its gone. <br>  <br>  might be worth going to the doctor and seeing if you can get a referral|`|b9689fed9476cf1689313993794dc53eaa	I have had cysts 3 times on the top of my wrist.right where it bends.  My doc did the watch and see approach and they went away.  Years ago my Dad had one and the Doctor pressed really hard on it and popped it.    Also I have a fatty tumor on the inside of my upper arm Doc said wait and watch so I got a second opinion and was told the same thing Fatty tumor and wait and see.|`|dzLLqFz1aa	may be a cist. get it checked by a doctor.
Bg3lbGR1aa	Try using massage oils/lubes. Be Creative, Be Bold and have fun. Don't psych yourself into thinking that it won't be pleasurable because of the medication.<br>  <br>  It's like going to the dentist... the Novocaine won't work if you THINK it won't work or get nervous.
X6aYVpU3aa	yeah it is. Consult your doctor about this itching. Your vagina is infected of yeast or vagina'sis.  It is tolerable for the first time and you will not notice the discharge and you have to be alarmed of the smell. try the clotrimazole (pessary). Or just drink lots of water or coconut juice, eat plenty of geen vegetable, yogurt and have a enough sleep, relax and don't use any perfume, soap or any detergent in your vagina, just wash it with plain water.|`|sLI3uBk1aa	scratch it<br>  lol sorry i had to say that|`|ad8dOQVWaa	Honestly, your probably just sensitive to spermacide.  I am, I have the same reaction that you described above.  Went away soon after we switched to regular condoms.  You should be fine, just hold a warm rag to your vagina for a couple minutes or spread some vagisil on it for a day or two and it should calm down.  But because it could also be a yeast infection (I get them occasionally with my period and don't have a discharge from it until it begins to clear) you should probably get checked by a doctor.|`|AA12187942	I recommend an anti-fungal topical cream such as tinactin or golds bond cream. It could be a topical yeast infection, which does not cause discharge but can cause a bright red rashy surface, like a heat rash. staying away from caffeine and sugars in your diet for a few days could help as well, either way. wash the infected surface thoroughly with a mild soap and water, dry completely, apply anti-fungal cream, rub in thoroughly and then use a powder such as talcum to prevent moisture in that area until the itch and irritation goes away.|`|N6EP6b4kaa	go get it checked out baby i think you have an infection
f7930e1b0e3632495c035cf67bd8dc26aa	bi-polar is when you have EXTREME highs and nearly suicidal lows<br>  and by extreme i mean stays up for 3 days and calls you at 2 in the morning<br>  <br>  also bi-polar is a chemical imbalance in the body and 'hot temper' is just how someone's personality is|`|5V8yqwdWaa	Yeah, a hot temper is a personality.  But, right now there is not a particular diagnosis for it.  Although, I think that the APA is considering making one.
DIRbVD5uaa	I havent ever used it but I have an Older friend who used it for a while and she didnt see an weight loss. Its pretty much a scam. Dont waste your money on it. And no, there is no problems on your skin after using it|`|T9fuWReRaa	No. It's a scam and it doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money.
IUlIixJLaa	If you have any kind of disorder then you shouldn't deprive yourself of sleep, especially if you have a chemical imbalance. Usually a depressed person sleeps too much or just won't get out of bed. If you are bi-polar and don't get the right amount of sleep then you get either manic or depressed, I am not really sure about other disorders but I do know that if you keep on a schedule it could be the best thing for you|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Sometimes I can't sleep and then just have a "crashing" period. It's like you can't win. But as hard as it is to get sleep, you might just try and relax and get as much sleep as you can, because it really does rejuvenate the body and mind.|`|0DDlABTraa	Yes. I get into really weird moods where I'm ridiculously hyperactive, and then I come down and I feel awful for ages. If I don't sleep, then I stay tired and I feel fine. I generally don't sleep for 2 days or so, then sleep for 3-4 hours each night for a few nights, then start over.|`|AA12361886	I don't like to go to sleep.  it seems to be such a waste of time. but then I go to sleep and I can't seem to wake up or want to wake up.     I hate it.   It doesn't help, it makes it worse.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	yer it does work<br>  but it's probally cause ur numb from doin nothing<br>  cause i read in dis article tat if you dont sleep enough<br>  u begin to get driven by emotion <br>  and i reckon tat tat'l mean worst depression<br>  but i dunno cause <br>  it kinda helps me 2|`|F32uPjAraa	No, after four days, I began to hallucinate.|`|QSAPw7AOaa	Maybe it helps because it gives you some time to yourself. I don't know if its the case with you but with me the constant noise of just people and regular things going on can just build up stress after a while, if you're up in the middle of the night, when the rest of the world is asleep, its quiet, you can relax, unwind, get some work done, whatever you want to do, sometimes its just an easier environment to operate in mentally.|`|2BceQT7waa	That sounds like a particularly bad idea. Sleep deprivation is dangerous, and is no cure for anything I've ever heard of, and particularly not depression. If anything, sleep deprivation can cause or exacerbate depression. If you want to feel better, see a doctor.|`|ZaO65qpBaa	No, doesn't sound healthy or right......it just may be a temporary phase of feeling better, but after a week you might be sleeping 3 days straight! I find I want to sleep more if I'm feeling depressed, and lots of sleep makes me feel better, not enough sleep makes me feel worse! Go see a doctor and get some meds for depression, seriously, it will help and in no time you will be back to your old self.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Generally, sleep deprivation can cause depression. There were studies done that even showed how it increases your ability to put negative events into long term memory, but postiive events were somewhat lost|`|5V8yqwdWaa	No, I feel better the more I sleep.  I mean before I slept for like 2 days and felt great.|`|MpNM52JNaa	I've never even thought of that, maybe you're just too tired to process that fact that you're depressed.|`|d3e1ff025d0b60a4691250c89b2304ceaa	u r genius|`|sqHGKKhLaa	no

She tells me cause I go down on her so when its like that I might not do oral but everything else is not any issue.<br>  <br>  So YES... I would have sex and its not any concern for me.  I do it all the time and don't even think of it anymore.  She is always wanting sex when its flowing so I am very cool knowing its there.<br>  <br>  8-)     Real males don't care....

tX57rwksaa	It is usual because the lungs are searching for the nicotine.<br>   Try very deep breathing slowly in pulled by the diaphragm, hold it and then slowly exhale. If you feel dizzy doing it ,it is OK, you are taking in more oxygen than your body has been used to for a long time. Just stop,rest a while and start again.<br>   Good luck do not start again keep it up.|`|ReaD6u4paa	yes its normal.your lungs is full of mucous and its going to come out sooner or later.if its does not come out then you have bronchiectasis.<br>  go and see a doctor..he might precribe you some ventolin.if you stop smoking it only stops you from doing further damage to your body .what has been damaged cannot be repaired.start doing some sport it might help.|`|lFHo1BHSaa	Cant answer your question, just to let you know i gave up 11 days ago, and have felt awful ever since, cant concentrate, spent 3 days being on another planet, just caught a cold after having one only a few weeks ago, i wont go back ( i hope) cause im not letting the little nicotine monster beat me.

Keep up the good fight lol|`|qSwGwO5Kaa	I have had the same breathlessness when I quit smoking in last April, it lasted for some weeks.

Just make sure you don't smoke again.

stUzx5VVaa	You should ask your doctor.  The information in the chart will help your doctor determine if it was a negative reaction or a true allergy.  Either way, you need to determine what it was so you can avoid receiving the med again.|`|bTfR8OnDaa	Are you on any other medications? I had that happen to me once. They gave me Levaquin which reacts with my Celexa and my arm and veins started turning red and itching. If you're not on any other meds, you should know that itching is a common side effect of medicines. I am allergic to vicodan and it makes me itchy. Sometimes those side effects will eventually go away, or if you need to take the medicine the doctor might recommend taking Benadryl with it. IF it is an allergic reaction the same thing will happen EVERY time you have that medicine in your body. So you need to find out the name of it.|`|juhim6Bhaa	That's an allergic reaction. I would find out the name of the med, because you need to know. Allergies can get worse. It could randomly kill you if you took it again

WgvhULEpaa	I started my period at a very young age 12 and trust me my periods were awful. My mother would never take me to the doctor so I went  for years in pain. I understand what you are going though and I am now 28 years old and my periods are fine. The older you get the better they get for some people. If this continues talk to your mother and ask fer to take you to the doctor and let them help you. I am sorry and feel your pain but in the school system today they do not care the reason they want you there sick or not.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	I used to go (I'm 19 now, so school isn't an issue!). When I got my first period, it was the second day of high school when I was 13 so I didn't go, basically because I was petrified! As it progressed, though, I went to school. I think I'm lucky I didn't get the nasty cramps, although now I get headaches in the leadup! Everyone is different, though. You should start to feel better in a few years when your body adjusts properly.|`|AA11678263	I'm too old for school now, but I get really bad pains on my first day and feel like screaming.  I handle it by taking two ibuprofen as soon as I come on or feel like I am going to, and staying dosed up until day two.  I definitely can't sleep without tablets on the first night.  Paracetamol has never worked for me.  Try that, or if they are not strong enough, go to the Dr and get a presecription.  My mum takes tablets 10X as strong as ibuprofen to manage hers.  You can't afford to miss a day of school every month, and later, work, so you need to try and find a solution now.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	If you're being sick then go to the doctors for christ sakes! And im at school to and i always go in even when im on my period. You cant keep missing school and going home because of your period. You've got it for many years to come so you need to sort this out. Go to your GP and tell them the pains your experiencing and that you are sometimes sick and get it sorted.|`|qVhqc019aa	I go everywhere on my period ..a little bloating does not stop my normal activities..and luckily I don't get cramps anymore and I have light periods..as you get older, it seems like they lessen. <br>  <br>  ?|`|v3IobQCgaa	I don't get cramps that bad.

She turned out to have something wrong with her internally...you may want to see a doctor, especially if it has you missing school. I have luckily always been lighter, and have few, if any cramps.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	I have a 14 year old daughter who missed a day or two of school last year because of the pain. she takes pain killers now and goes to school. talk to your parents about getting you to the doctor to see if he or she can give you a script for period pain medications. they work|`|7XJPyENFaa	I usually did.  Most of the time, the pains wouldn't start until later in the day, so I'd take along some Advil to take at lunch (I always have to take it after I eat 'cause I discovered that it makes my cramps WAY worse on an empty stomach).|`|QBCh4kKcaa	I can... most times I do but if it's REALLY bad then I might skip my morning class... <br>  <br>  [in college so skipping classes isn't really an option. found out a long time ago that period first day isn't acceptable as an absence excuse >.<]|`|555f4ccf8a2a051ad5d0e52353492915aa	I rarely do, I get very bad cramps. I think Im like you. Haha.<br>  Sometimes I don't even go the second day, it all just depends on how I feel.|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	nope i am not aloud my foster mum says you have to deal with it which pisses me off|`|QMWlOSXraa	They are period pains...you are not dying! <br>  Take some paracetamol and get on with it.<br>  Lying around only makes you feel sorry for yourself and feel worse!<br>  Exercise is one of the best things you can do during your period.<br>  Mine are terrible but I am no longer at school, I have an important job and can't just take days off willy nilly. On my break I have my hot water bottle on my tummy but then once again I get up and get on with it.|`|Un5u1OCFaa	it all comes down to how bad your periods are1 for me it is different every month, sometime it's so bad i wish i were a boy, and the flow is very heavy, so i don't go to school but sometimes it is just ok, so i go to school! every girl feels different during their perios, some get back ache, lose bowels, nausea etc, so it all comes down to how you feel if you feel terrible stay home, no harm done! lol . . .|`|rX1QZrCJaa	hmm interesting question- I've always wondered if other people did or not.<br>  It depends on how bad I'm feeling. I can usually take some pain killers an hour before I leave and feel fine, but if I don't, I feel like crap! Sometimes i tell mum i'm sick so she'll let me stay home lol. Sometimes i get really bad side affects (gross stuff you probly dont wanna know haha) so it's just hell going to school.<br>  <br>  I always get bad stomach cramps as well and they SUCK! friggin periods!! lol|`|ZRu2DxEqaa	Yeah I do. But mine are very light. I can only wear the lite tampons and my cramps are not that bad  lucky me lol. But i'm really sorry about your cramps. I use to be like that back when i was in middle school. I use to carry around Tylenol extra strength rapid release and boy did it help lol|`|Js0mg82Saa	well i normaly get made too..<br>  but somtimes i come home..<br>  it depends..<br>  like the other day i had my period and i took some pain killers and it didnt go away. and then i vomited. this is embarresing somtimes i dont go because i get the shitz aswell so it depends on the month..|`|9WgZZFGfaa	i suffer really bad so the first day i wouldn't be able you should try take a painkiller the night or before you think your getting your periods it will help also there is a magnet available and its really helping me with the cramps|`|79yyNDmHaa	Yup I still go to school on the first day. I use to get horrible cramps when i was in middle school, as in cold sweat and muscle pain with the killer cramps. After a while though, I got better and I even go out for P.E. :D|`|yf1A2FHfaa	If you are that  bad then you should stay home. Sometimes i just want to stay in bed it gets so bad. You could try taking pain killers before school but may be you should stay home. Catch up with school work from a mate.|`|5VHsEEcBaa	OOO. sorry.<br>  Im a lucky one.since ive never had Period pains and i started my period at 14 & im 15 now.So i go in and try to forget about it.Good luck.|`|AA12119862	I work - you cannot take time off work every month so best get into a good habit at school and live through it - try taking natural remidies to help the pain|`|82dikbhoaa	I do everyone has to i think education is moree important than your gooch bleeding don't you? <br>  <br>  To help me i take a pain reliver before school <br>  Which helps humdreds hang in there sweetie.=]]|`|cku5S9WLaa	My mum would make me go to school regardless.

nZ1CgU1caa	I think you should go to bed around 8... It all depends on how much sleep you can lean on.<br>  <br>  If you go to bed around 8 - 8:30, you'll have a good full 8 hours of sleep... It's really up to you, but no later than 11 or you'll be beat!|`|5ovVrWEHaa	if you can you should go to sleep 8 hours before which is at 8:00 pm so you can go rested and do better at the gym.its also a good idea to set an alarm clock or two and set them at 3:30 to have tons of time to change
fvuEtkROaa	You probably got thumbs down because many people are not as aware as you that HPV is a cause of cervical cancer.  That is why the new vaccine whch is available  is being encouraged for young, sexually active women.  It  will not be 100 % effective, but it is the best thing we have right now.  Glad you are keeping up with the newest in health care.  :-)|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer is not a sexually transmitted infection.  Virgins can get it.  You're getting thumbs down as people will think you're saying that only women who sleep around get cervical cancer, which is just not true.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Because thats not the only thing that causes cancer, first of all to get cancer that way you have to be continually exposed to a high risk HPV, and even then only a quarter of HPV are sexually transmitted.|`|rrkmmbnEaa	Cancer can seriously damage your health|`|jtjISk6qaa	any cancer can kill.|`|hXehbPVqaa	yes it is thats why you  gotta get a pap smear every 2 years
RnLzXeMGaa	no way<br>  and green tea is best|`|f890d82e3b2cb1a15aa475ff75321c1aaa	Tea on its own is not fattening at all, no. It's the addition of cream or milk that makes it fattening. However it may stain your teeth--after many years of constant drinking. Just keep it in moderation and you have nothing to worry about. Alternatively, switch to green tea, which actually boosts your metabolism and is light enough that it won't stain your teeth.|`|O7slexsAaa	No. In fact, it is the opposite. Drinking certain types of tea helps to cleanse your insides, so it is recommended that you drink tea when you are eating oily foods. Although tea has caffeine, there are many positive effects of drinking it. For example, drinking oolong tea is said to prevent cancer. I'm not sure how true that is, but it doesn't hurt to try!|`|lb8FBhWnaa	Lol no it will only make you fat if you add sugar or cream. Most tea's are 0 calories each. Yes, some tea can stain your teath, like green tea or black tea. But, tea's that are fairly white or clear will not stain your teeth.|`|fOfqPATaaa	yes it stains your teeth and there's SO much caffeine.  As for it being fattening, it depends on how you take it..
C1JDaYChaa	No it is just another sort of tea.|`|5UJSX3vJaa	any tea with caffeine in it is going to boost your metabolism<br>  this is like the 3rd ? where some dummy's said no there's no proof ahhh<br>  YES tea does raise your metabolism tea has more caffeine in it than coffee does and it does have a thermodynamic affect on the body|`|FvtBS9cpaa	It is neither good nor bad for your "metabolism", but it does contain Antioxidants which are good for destroying free radicals in the body. It tasted good too.
jxSNecnyaa	Depends on your individual metabolism. But I would say that it's below caloric-normal quantities.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Nope. I'd make no changes to your diet. You're getting plenty of nutrients, proteins and eating plenty of fruits and vegies! It sounds fine (and delicious!)|`|YteiWSM1aa	The obvious way to burn fat is to consume less food and exercise more, the issues surface when we actually attempt to put that into operation! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The one method which really worked for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I lost twenty five pounds, it really does produce results!|`|WJlNLw7Paa	you definitely ate about or over 2000 calories if you do eat on a 2000 calories diet;  but i don't think that you over did it too much. mostly what you ate was healthy.

ioOBMQ15aa	There should be a free clinic or a low cost one for women.. also check out planned parenthood if they are available. Free clinics are generally hard to get appointments at, but it's definitely worth a try. <br>  <br>  I have personally lost my period for a couple months due to exercise and diet, and then separately due to depression and stress. I think it's something that changes when the body is undergoing huge changes, but you definitely should rule out pregnancy. The stick tests don't always work though so it's best to get a doctor to just double check.<br>  <br>  Do a google search for your city & "free women's clinic" and hopefully you will find one that is accessible. Also check nearby cities if yours is booked for a long time - it's worth the drive.|`|gH5FPXURaa	go to hospital nd give bogus info|`|O1TekaXDaa	pregnant|`|G6jTu4Ibaa	stress i think and may be being overweight as your pic says<br>  rest all is fine,|`|ysI5MiP7aa	Its possible that you will need to get a pregnancy test by blood, maybe the hormones are not being picked up in your urine.

nUTJYYhTaa	You cannot wear sunglasses in place of your glasses as you will not see clearly inside. Prescription sunglasses are esentially the same as regular prescription glasses but yes they are tinted.<br>  <br>  Most private insurance companies allow for one pair of prescription glasses a year or a supply of contacts. They also typically allow a certain amount so if you exceed that amount you are responsible for the rest. If you choose to use your insurance to pay for these sunglasses, you cannot also get a pair of regular glasses covered by your insurance. They cover one pair per year. Medicare has similar guideline and if you are on Medicare check with your secondary insurance as well. As far as Medicaid goes, I would hope they would not cover prescription sunglasses as they are a type of "luxury product" that tax payers should not be providing free of charge to low income patients unless medically necessary.<br>  <br>  In terms of how much they cost, that depends on the frame you pick, and the type of lenses. High index lenses cost more but provide for a lighter feel and thinner look than plastic or polycarbonate lenses. Additionally for anyone with a prescription of more than + or - 3.00 I would only suggest high index lenses. Do not let someone try to sell you polycarbonate lenses if your prescription is above this as your sight will not be as clear as it should.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider picking a frame that comes with a magnetic clip on sunglass. That way you get regular glasses and sunglasses for the price of one.|`|TE74KhTCaa	my suggesting would be getting as much information as you can before taking any action,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a good place for that <br>  purpose.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Why not use clip-ons?<br>  <br>  As long as you don't need your glasses to drive, then ordinary sunglasses will be perhaps OK, but if they mess with your vision, as opposed to your prescription ones, don't use them.<br>  <br>  Do you not have an outlet like 'Specsavers' near to you where if you get new glasses, you can also get a pair of prescription sunglasses free?<br>  <br>  Another way might be to checkout Specsavers on the net and see what it would cost for them to ship to you, with you knowing your prescription, you need not bother with the eye test.<br>  Just a thought.|`|170GrvE0aa	Sunglasses are not any different than normal glasses. Of course, you can't just wear them inside the house because there might not have enough light so that everything is darker. You should switch between prescription sunglasses and normal prescription glasses OR you can use clip-ons. Now about the price, *this shocks people a bit because they are actually so cheap* can go as low as $39 for a pair with clip-ons, and as low as $24 for prescription glasses. The normal glasses cost as low as $15. The store is www.optical4less.com<br>  <br>  If you're worried about the integrity, I have bought almost all my glasses from this store without a slightest problem. So you can forget insurance whether they cover or not becuase the prices really are so cheap. Ordering eyeglasses online is the way to go now because all the stores in your area jack the prices up by a lot. So check out optical4less. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!

eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Be careful with the Zoloft. Friend of mine didn't take his right and it made it worse.  I agree, 1 week on the meds isn't long enough for them to affect you.<br>  <br>  IMO- you learn to cope with the depression although you may continue to have signs and bad days from time to time. Give it time. Depression sometimes takes  a long time to get past- and whats worse it usually doesn't make any sense.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	despite the stigma against males and depression, you shouldn't feel bad about feeling bad. talk about a vicious cycle. you have a psychological and maybe even biological condition, not a behavioral problem you're responsible for. i'm not claiming this is a disease like some people do with alcoholism, it's not a matter of willpower.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Depresion may be an issue your whole life. However, it will get better. You might only have a few bad weeks here and there throughout the year. Maybe you'll even just have a few bad days a year or so. It will get better. You are BARELY feeling the zoloft yet. Give it time.|`|9hpuBMuIaa	The zoloft may not be the correct drug for you to be on, but it takes time to find out if it is.  If you can manage it, counseling will help too.  The two are a good treatment.  I have been going through depression since our daughter was killed in 1990 and so has my husband. So far I have had my antidepressants changed 4 times.  Am now on Lexapro and it is working really good.  But talking to a professional can do a world of good.  Therapists are trained to help you find out what the cause of your depression is and to gauge if the meds you are on are working right.<br>    My husband thought it was foolish, but finally had to admit it was more a man thing than a good reason so started seeing one and it helped him so much to get better. He has improved 1,000%.  SO, don't let being male keep you from getting the help you need.  Anyone can get depressed and there is nothing wrong with admitting that you could use some help. You've taken the first step by getting the Zoloft.  Good luck.|`|84be0d3fcba82930adcce6a09996c0ceaa	You deal with depression your whole life. It's a chemical inbalance you cannot control.

Feed it whatever medicine is necessary but carry on with your life as normal and hard though it might be, learn to gently laugh at it.  It never really goes away but it does get easier with management control.  If you are that way inclined it wasnt too hard to see that you would of course be upset at leaving a good friend - the difference being where a person without depression would be down about it, might even cry, within a few days they would pick up again.  The one with depressive issues however goes down a lot deeper into the feeling, which then causes other feelings to come in and takes them longer to deal with it.  <br>  It really is a case of absolute positive thinking.<br>  I have had a good visit with my friend.<br>  This visit is going to be like a sunshine in my life for weeks to come.<br>  Think positively about the next time you are going to see your friend and what you will do together - when the thought comes in about wondering if you would ever see her again - forcibly push it from your mind and change to not if but when.<br>  Eventually the brain will get the message and release whatever it is that is needed to make you positive not negative.<br>  <br>  Your depression may not be right honey, but it is what it is.  <br>  We have members of our family who suffer it - it has run through the generations.  The younger ones have a different way of dealing with it.<br>  One of them literally visualises it as kicking it up the backside.<br>  Another puts it in a box and locks it and refuses to let it out.<br>  There's a way for everyone to deal with it.

hDWaxGgDaa	I know I had 3 of my lumbar sympathetic blocks turn out now they had expected. I had one where my leg went completely numb, and they thought I had a blood clot (which I did not). Eventually the numbness wore off and the pain came back. None o fmy doctors know why this happened. I had 2 other blocks that didn't turn out so well either. In both of these my pain was gone, but my foot was in extreme pain (at this point I didn't yet have the RSD/CRPS in my foot). I had one doctor who said that this may have happened becase the RSD/CRPS was spreading into my foot, and my other doctor said that the anesthsiologist may have just got the block in the wrong place which I'm wondering if that's what happened in your case. It is typical for your back to hurt after these types of blocks are done. After all of the blocks I had done my back was sore for several days- originally when I had my first block done the doctor said that my back would feel like a 2x4 hit me in the back for a while after the block. I didn't think the pain was that bad, but I'm sure for some people it can be. My suggestion would be to start just making appiontments with pain manegment doctors in your area until you find one that you find helpful for treating your pain. I started with a pain manegment doctor and went through them until I found one that was able to help me. I think I went to at least 5 doctors or so here in Utah (some of them I only saw a few times and other ones were actually able to help me and I saw them until they couldn't do anything more for me), and finally the doctor that ended up putting me into remission was in Arkansas. Good luck!|`|dVMM8RgWaa	These NERVE BLOCKS are bullshit in my opinion.  Dont do it again.  I have been taking Gabapentin for my nerve problems.

Do not go back to this Pain Dr. and find a new one.  The only reason I can think of the wrist not being affected is because they did not block that level in your spine.

That doesn't make sense at all.<br>  <br>  I'm not due to see my pain doc for another month, but if you can tell me specifically where you go (which hospital is your pain doc or your ortho affiliated with), I can see if he is familiar with anyone in your area.  If you do not want to tell me the hospital, maybe the city where you are.  I think you've told me before, but please forgive me for not remembering.  <br>  <br>  I hope you start to feel better very soon, J. <br>  <br>  ::::EDIT TO ADD::::  Pain Drs (Anesthesiologists) are usually affiliated with a Pain Center.  <br>  <br>  Me

31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	The Scapula as it is referred to cannot be into shape.  The fact that you think they are big is an indication of perhaps reduced weight.  Often young frames will show more scapula due to lack of body fat.  The job of the scapula it to hold the arm socket in place while allowing for motion.<br>  <br>  The blade uses its area as a counter force against someone ripping your arm off.   Its rare to break a scapula because of how its mounted.  Flat against the back side of the rib cage.<br>  <br>  A broken one is an indication of a very severe injury and most likely inclusive of other structural failures.  Showing scapula means you are thin or young or both.  As body mass increases the scapula slowly gets hidden. <br>  <br>  Eating foods high in fat will make them less visible.  Not sure they are of much concern.  Everyone has two of them, and they all stick out.  Mine do cause I am not fatty enough to hide them.  They are not in a place where I can see them so I forget they are there.

Things may be bad right now and people you know and care about may be acting stupid, but everything eventually will work itself out. Teen years suck, but it gets better. Bad things happen to everyone and for the most part we all find a way through it, and I'm sure you will too, just try to look on the bright side. I know that probably doesn't help, but I was depressed for years while I was a younger teen, and it may seem like everything is falling apart and you have no control over anything, but it will get better.|`|hEJ5GCPCaa	**** what people say around u... **** the person that popped u in ur gap ok? just because u gotta chipped tooth doesnt mean that people can rash on u because of it ive gotten teeth knocked out left and right when people ask tell them its a battle wound lol u kno who u are nd that chipped tooth shouldent be lowering u.. yea and about the girlfriend thing there are plenty other girls out there for you u dont need a girlfriend ur only 16 nd just try talking to her nd say ur sorry if its that bad ignore her if shes really that good of a friend she will come around and talk to you just keep ur head up. =P -lisa|`|eWEqGHvJaa	I can only offer this: Be yourself and don't let the other people around you get you down.  You seem to be a good guy and want to help you mother. even if she is hurtful.  If you have other friends get to them and talk to someone you can trust. As for your tooth, There are several things that a dentist can do to make it look like it used to.  Some girls will go for a guy with a chipped tooth because they think they are tough.  Put a smile on your face and don't let the world get you down.|`|3lNxhvQ4aa	I feel the beating has knocked your confidence not just because of your chipped tooth but on a deeper level and because of this all these other things seem worse than what they are...Your mum doe's her best to bring you and your brother up on very little money and she is raising decent boys, you say you are looking for work to get a little extra money which is great try the supermarkets and local businesses near you or wash cars,walk peoples dogs for them for a certain fee,get a paper round or try the Betterware which is a catalogue selling home products or Avon womens cosmetics...<br>  <br>  Speak to a counsiller about how this beating has affected you as its more than your chipped tooth... Call your girl pal and explain how your feeling and that you miss her friendship and you really need a friend at the moment....Thinkmore positive I'm sure girls dont just like you because you have nice teeth,you are a nice person with feelings and are sensitive to others feelings too its not as bad as it seems and there is always someone else worse of than you remember your hormones and body are still developing and changing which can cause you to feel like this stay positive and strong I wish you luck and hope you feel better soon take care
AA11593134	The reason they say it is not good to have your hands behind your heads is that you tend to pull your head up while doing the situps and this could put a strain on your neck muscles. If you just have your hands behind your heads and not pull, then you should be good. The best way is just to cross your hands across your chest while doing situps.|`|r3Rr8Ucfaa	Yeah its because some people tend to help push their head up by doing that, which puts strain on your neck and can be harmful. Try having your arms crossed on your chest, get used to this and then you can do it whilst holding a weight there too.|`|DeU22M9Vaa	its up to the person. some peoples necks are not as strong as others. i prefer not to use my hands, instead i put them by my sides. i also find that it doesn't work your abs as much if your hands are behind your head and then it can also strain your neck even more because of the unnessesary thrusts.|`|ScAZ2qCUaa	It's the same to do sit-ups with your hands behind your head as it is with your hands on the floor.

If you have heavy periods it can help to make the bleeding lighter but it does not postpone/delay your period. <br>  I have been taking these for many years due to very painful periods and ovulation pain. I sometimes take them for up to 21 days of the month and my periods are always spot on time so i would think it unlikely that these tablets are the cause of you being late.<br>  Hope this helps:):)|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Yes<br>  <br>  My mate takes that if she wants to postpone her period.

The effects can range from minor problems like poor memory to schizophrenia. Problems like the latter can have a major effect on society, like danger to the public, staffing resources to care for the person, costs involved to tax payers, etc. Taking these brief points into consideration, and the fact that there is a big increase in supply and demand for the drug recently, I think this is why it has been changed to class B.|`|2pi1H46Vaa	noones ever died from smoking it. its the tobacco which is legal that kills you. they probably changed it to coincide with their anti dope ad campaign but appart from that theres no reason. it bounces between b and c every few years|`|a193b0793e7a03094639e76b99ad9e23aa	at this rate alcohol should be rated as well.|`|AA10047095	noone died well at least i didn't hear about it, i think the main reason they upgraded the class was because they never really knew the affects of weed and still don't paranoia and mental issues are strongly linked with it now.   <br>  <br>  I think there plan also was if we decriminalise it people will stop useing it as it is no longer a risk factor, it didn't work so they upgraded it.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	Because many of the people who campaigned for the reduction in classification discovered that their children, who they had not bothered to stop smoking Cannabis, suddenly started ending up in Psychiatric hospitals because of the psychological damage the drug had done.<br>  <br>  They realised that the weed which they dabbled with as kids and 'really doesn't do any harm', is actually a very powerful drug, which no one really knows very much about, but its becoming obvious that heavy use during teenage years is having catastrophic effects on the mental health of users, and is turning happy go lucky well adjusted kids into mashed zombified cannabis bores.<br>  <br>  Like any addiction, its not necessarily the addiction that kills you, but the general decay in the addicts well being, and cannabis has been a factor in deaths, but the main issue is the destruction which addiction to this drug does to families.<br>  <br>  Many of the smart alecs who campaigned for the reduction in classification are now rowing back pretty quickly because they have seen just how dangerous the drug is and the effect it has had on their own children.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	There is a war being fought on the boarder between Mexico and the United States. The drug cartel in Mexico is getting more and more aggressive in their turf wars with each other. It is spreading into the US more and more. Much of the drug trafficking being done is marijuana. In order to make an impact on the situation that is going on, the laws and penalties needed to be more severe. <br>  Remember just because weed is not perceived to be a dangerous drug and many find it less harmful and more tolerant than some legalized drugs such as nicotine and alcohol, it does not mean that buying it is not putting money into the pockets of very evil people. These people don't just smuggle drugs across boarders. They also kidnap people for ransom and kill. Phoenix is now the second highest kidnap for ransom city in the world. Mexico City is the highest. These drug dealers are bringing their violence right into the United States and by buying drugs, no matter how harmless they seem is assisting the drug cartels in their take over of our American boarder states.<br>  Extensive studies about the effects of cannabis are only just being completed. The prevailing idea that this drug does no harm and may even help to treat or aleaviate certain medical conditions is being found to not be true. The drug is being found have a strong link between strong cannabis use and mental illness. There is no telling what further study will tell us about the prolonged use of this drug. Don't think it is safe.
xnZi0i8saa	Everyone goes through ups and downs, that is perfectly normal. Clinical depression is when it doesn't go away for weeks or months on end. I wouldn't worry about it unless it is really interfering with your life..... Having the blues now and then is nothig to worry about.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Yes there is a big difference between feeling depressed and being depressed.  I know I've dealt with depression since I was nine years old and I'm now 54.  Feeling depressed doesn't usually last more than a few days.  Being depressed last more than two weeks with significant changes in life style.  The first person was right about most of the symptoms of depression for it to be a clinical depression it has to last more than two weeks.  IF your feelings have lasted more than two weeks straight and you have some of the symptoms you should thing about getting therapy so that you'll feel better for longer periods of time.|`|r0Ni4JJDaa	Uh-huh. There is a difference between feeling depressed and actually being depressed. When you're feeling depressed, you're probably upset over some particular event that happened. However, if you are being depressed, your whole life is a blur and you never feel like anything good is going to happen so you have the "why bother living" attitude. You're probably just going through a low point in your life right now, but if you feel like hurting yourself or someone else then you really need to contact a professional/someone you trust.|`|wtdic2w7aa	Everyone has a depressed mood occasionally.<br>  <br>  But clinical depression is a mental disorder where a very low mood is persistant in all areas of life, and almost always more than simply feeling miserable.<br>  <br>  Common symptoms are insomnia (a classic pattern is waking early and not being able to get back to sleep), lack of appetite, a lack of interest in activities you previously enjoyed. You can be preoccupied by thoughts of helplessness, worthlessness, or self hatred, might be irritable or lethargic. <br>  <br>  Physical symptoms can also be present such as headaches or digestive problems.<br>  <br>  In severe cases depressed people may have symptoms of psychosis such as delusions (i.e. thinking people want to hurt them) and less commonly, hallucinations.|`|6uQh4VSpaa	It ultimately depends on how much it effects your life.  If it's having an impact on your social or work/school life, then it's worth seeing what you can do to treat it, right?<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I suggest reading about "cognitive behavioral therapy".  It's a way of approaching your emotions as a product of your thoughts and opinions, and there are a lot of books/web sites that can help you do 'self-therapy'.  For many cases of mild depression, it can really help!

31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	1. If so, how do you do it?  <br>  " You Cannot since it will not. "<br>  <br>  2. How long until you notice results? <br>  "Depends on diet."<br>  <br>  3. Every article I have read says that you start<br>  growing breasts by 13. I will be 15 next week and am completely<br>  Flat chested. What does this mean?<br>  "It means you are doing very well. And its a good thing"<br>  <br>  Here is the total real answer.  Ready ?   Are you sure you are ready ?  Your correct answer is not what you'd expect.  So one more time.  Do you really want the real answer ???<br>  <br>  Fine....<br>  <br>  Fat is what they are made of.  No exercise is required.  Lots of Whole Milk, high calcium and fat in your diet and you can look like you came right from the farmers field.<br>  <br>  WARNING :<br>  Now for the real surprise.  Its not like a male penis.  Bigger is not better.  Flat is in and no one will tell you this.  Even males do not understand this.  Despite the fact that they are causing it to be this way.  <br>  <br>  Most males will look at the girl sporting D cups.  Hell you would too.  Big cans will cause a male to look at them.  Here is the big surprise.  We only LOOK at them.  We date the FLAT girls every time.  Flat means young !  <br>  <br>  Show me one SUPER MODEL and I will show you a flat chested girl.  HOT !  How hot ???<br>  <br>  Very hot.  Your goal should be to stay as flat as possible for as long as possible.  Gravity effects this fat and later you will pay as they sag to the ground.  Fat unlike muscle cannot hold up against the big "G"<br>  <br>  I never date a girl with anything more than a B cup.  A big breast means a big caboose to match.  You might think looking like Elsie the cow is a good thing...  Males will look but its not what we take home to mom.<br>  <br>  Do not let the media or young boys that don't know what they are looking at run your life into this all too familiar trap.  They do little to satisfy a male other then good for looks.<br>  <br>  The interesting thing is that even males are not aware that they do this.  Studies dictate that the bigger they get the less males will date them.  You get more looks, but less real attention. Totally not the expected results, and males are not even aware that they are doing this.  <br>  <br>  My very best date ever was when I was 28.  This girl was 24 years old and could not fill an A cup.   She even made fun of her own self.  Calling herself dumb and flat.  Dumb cause she was blond and flat cause she was flatter then I was, and I'm a guy.<br>  <br>  First she was not dumb...  She was very smart.  But the FLAT was true.  She was the best girl I ever dated.  EVER.   The flat was not just fine, it was really OK.  She was perfect.  Like the 5th ELEMENT perfect.   Small is in.  90% of females do not know this.<br>  <br>  To verify this look at hot new stars in the media.  All flat.  You can have the COW look if you want but be careful what you wish for.  We might all look at you as we ask the girl next to you out on a FLAT date.<br>  <br>  This information is true and many males do not fully understand it right off the start.  Only when they look at who they selected does the proof lay out.<br>  <br>  Want dates...?   Keep them as small as you can keep them.<br>  Get fake ones and no male will date you.  Its as bad as smoking.   Both reduce the date factor by over 60%.<br>  <br>  Be flat and happy to be so.   Might not think so now but wait till you get out of school and inot the real world.  Kids make a big deal of breasts.. Its the only external feature we get to see in a female.  But its not what we look for later in life, and you need to know this.  FLAT is the only way.  It has a lot to do with making the female look young !  Young is good.  Old is yesterday's girl.  Understand....?<br>  <br>  YOUR BEST ANSWER is often not what you would have expected.|`|bwYVs2k9aa	i dont think that helps? but it probably means your gonna have small boobies. or if you havent started your period yet your just a late blooomer|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	No, I can't imagine that it would ;o)<br>  But come time, you will probably enjoy a boyfriend "massaging" them even more than other girls. The very smallest breasts are said to be completely packed with beautiful sensual feelings. And if you have been very shy about them, you will of course also enjoy the relief that they are fine and feel good even more than the other girls ;o)<br>  <br>  They may suddenly "shoot" until you are about 22... but even if they don't you are absolutely fine. But to your question: no, massaging a girls breasts is only for mutual enjoying and bond between girlfriend and boyfriend. Don't be afraid that a boy who likes you will be disappointed that your breasts are "miniature". 99:1 he'll just think it is part of your special magic ;o) Don't be scared, sweet friend - I know this, because my wife is same/same.

juhim6Bhaa	*grins* It's fun to know the anwer to things. The sleep study does involve a lot of wire. Most people have sleep apnea, but we gather enough raw data to make sure we'll know if there's a less common disorder going on. There a number of wires on the scalp to monitor brain waves. That shows if you're asleep and the stage of sleep you are in. There are chin wires, 2 wires near eye, some form of wires to check for periodic limb movements, and EKG wires to see if bad breathing hurt your heart.  There's some form of thing to monitor your lung movments. In my lab, it's 2 belts. There's also some form of nasal sensor to monitor the flow of air when you breath.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that was rambly. I may have missed something. Also, some labs are different than others. There could be 2 or three more wires, or 2 or 3 less. Wear your pajamas. They should be fine. I only run in to problems when the patients have clothes so tight I can't roll them up to check a wire|`|uZDFVXF3aa	If I remember correctly, they attached wires to my head, jaw, legs, chest and stomach.

If you're concerned, call the hospital and ask, but pretty much anything you wear should be okay.
ZfvoW3m7aa	The longer you deprive yourself of sleep, the more accurate your results will be.  This test just maps out your brain waves and detects where any irregular signals are coming from.  Tumors can't be detected with this, but it can detect seizure disorders, like epilepsy.  An MRI is totally different.  My advice is to get the EEG done, wait for the results, and then leave it in the doctor's hands to decide what to do next.|`|sD0DFG4haa	Nope an mri is a completely different thing it is a scan of the brain while an eeg is showing brain waves and the electric pulses in your brain<br>  Yea the longer you stay up the clearer your results will be

Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first - main anxiety post] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.

e7yFahGraa	How tall are you? Unless you're about 5'0 or shorter you shouldn't be that thin (not very healthy). If you are then you should loose the weight at a slower rather than faster pace to reduce the chance of stretch marks and whatnot. Drink a lot of water and keep your skin hydrated with lotions. If stretch marks do start to show up use either cocoa butter or bio oil on them the help them fade more quickly.

That is a myth muscle cannot turn to fat and fat cannot turn to muscle. how old are you? Although i am pro-steriods i have never taken them and they are illegal so its a serious decision....think about it. have you tried other routes...gainer shakes? NO? creatine? The products from LG Sciences have all given me fantastic gains, the best i think is liquid masterdrol, have you tried that? Also try changing up your routine it is likely your body has just gotten used to what you are doing or take a couple weeks off from the gym and then get back into it. If you still decide steroids are the answer for you then when you get off them you will likely lose some of your gains, but not all as long as you continue to work out.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	A massive self-destructive urge is a mental disorder in itself. It is not usually caused by any other disease except in so far as that disease causes one to loathe oneself or life. For example if a person has a disease that causes disfigurement or causes much pain they may come to hate themselves or want to die just to relieve the pain. In any case such a person needs immediate professional help.<br>  <br>  By the way depression is one of the 6-8 basic emotions you are born with and is essential for life. It is a signal that your environment or whatever you are thinking or doing is bad for you and you need to change course. When it becomes chronic it is considered a disorder. Look up "emotions" in a Yahoo! web search. Wikipedia has a good summary. In my nonprofessional opinion most chronic depression is caused by a habit of negative thinking and can be cured by just learning to think positively. Look up "positive thinking techniques" in a Yahoo! web search.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|u1D5b9C1aa	You might have a borderline personality disorder? Or S&M or cyclomythia?

I used to suffer from anxiety/agoraphobia. <br>  <br>  I was thinking too much. I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room.

It's like smoking a cigarette but without the chemicals. it has adjustable nicotine levels so you can quit all together eventually.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	No<br>  It is healthier to give up smoking.<br>  <br>  Low tar cigarettes still carry the same risks ans normal cigarettes. Do not be fooled. There are no such things as healthy cigarettes.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	That's the best way to wean yourself off.  Next try smoking the cheapest most disgusting brand they have in ultralights.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	Really weak Cigarettes can actually be worse for you than normal ones, as you have to drag harder on them to get enough nicotine.<br>  Dragging harder makes them burn hotter, so delivering more Tar than normal. Remember, its not the nicotine that is harmful, its the tar.<br>  Nicotine is just super addictive. <br>  Untipped hand rolled cigarettes deliver the least amount of tar, and toxic chemicals into your system. Tailor mades have allsorts of "extras" added to them, like salt petre to help maintain an even burn.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	I don't like using the word healthier in conjunction with cigarettes but yes. Low tar cigs are a healthier option so long as you do not increase the number of cigs you smoke every day to make up for the loss of the hit gained from stronger ones. My boss even went from full tar to low tar and eventually quit because he slowly reduced his need for the kick. He didn't mean to quit but it just happened.|`|C73WFizXaa	it wont make it less addictive, but it might make it a tiny bit healthier, providing you don't start smoking more cigarettes in a day just because your not getting as much nicotine.|`|gTMpu7V7aa	No. You just draw harder to get the same hit.<br>  Stop smoking. You know you want to.|`|AA10309738	It will be very slightly easier for you to quit but they are just as damaging if not even more so because you will be inclined to take bigger drags even if you don't intend to.<br>  <br>  Unless you are leading up to quitting there is no benefit whatsoever to "light" smokes and even then the benefit is tiny.|`|ReaD6u4paa	no its not.to satisfy your does of nicotine you will smoke more cigarettes.so more toxic cancerous fumes to your lungs.<br>  tar is an irritant so a cigarette with less tar wont iritate you lungs that much and the fumes will distribute itself throughout the lungs and this put you at a higher risk for cancer.<br>  but i advised you to stop smoking because cigarrettes ,weak or strong, are not healthy at all|`|6c694750ebd6aa4c9fc2901e8ad350a3aa	As long as you smoke the same amount as you did before, it should be healthier.<br>  <br>  It does not work for me.  I switched to a lighter cigarette 5 years ago and went from smoking 10 cigarettes to smoking a pack a day.  I still smoke these light cigarettes because I prefer the taste.|`|2pi1H46Vaa	Hmmm. I switch between stong and lights depending on how my lungs feel that day. and they seem to treat your lungs better. but i do remember an advert ages ago saying that lights damage your lungs just as much. but to be honest these silk cut purples you must be smoking arent even real cigarettes just air you may as well stop.|`|Rc9SNllPaa	An avalanche start with a pebble.<br>  A great oak tree begins from a seed.<br>  Cancer starts from one negative cell.<br>  Malaria starts from one little mosquito bite.<br>  Take care and best wishes always<br>  No smoke without fire and fire can devastate everything in seconds.<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA<br>  Why take chances.|`|189pUDzEaa	Just stop it.<br>  Hope this spooky "helps":<br>  <a href="http://www.cigarette.com/quitsmokingpix.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cigarette.com/quitsmokingpix....</a>|`|jaZazNzZaa	Why not stop altogether?|`|AA11528369	NO|`|OZYschvYaa	Healthier?

xqQO81Omaa	Mine are 12-13 inches. I'm also 5ft2.<br>  <br>  The problem is my calves are on the skinny side but I have thick thighs lol.|`|Xx0Xsgwzaa	Just from a guys perspective, i like big calves. Why would you want smaller ones?|`|GoLY16hXaa	I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM TOOOO. My thighs are chunky. They're about 14 inches. That's kinda big for my height.
4WVbjbWxaa	if you want to grow muscles than you must change your diet<br>  <br>  Eat less. Eat often!<br>  Don't starve but eat less. Keep a gap of 2 hours between meals.<br>  <br>  Prefer eating five to six small meals per day, rather than three big meals. To achieve best results.|`|qUr5P7hgaa	don't start jogging.. That makes people look lean and skinny and you are trying to bulk up your legs. The best thing you can do it to do lower body weights.  You can only get them as big as they are intended to  go.. Sometimes you just have to accept what you were given... It is really hard to gain weight and muscles in one specific spot... Sorry :)|`|gXIA9yHJaa	eat healthy ride a bike, jog, do squats, and toe lifts for your calves. As long as your working your legs and eating right you will gain the muscle and tone you want. Remember the more you work out the more protein you need to build muscle and the more complex carbs you need to give you the energy you need.|`|EsWeUbEuaa	just start jogging :)|`|vdmqdlNfaa	why get bigger legs?  just lose body weight?|`|ofEYrechaa	Your perfect the way u r, trust me.|`|hxt613FGaa	walking at-least 8-7kms a day brisk walk and try out slow to medium jogging with the walk this might help ur wish.|`|YXlIg3f5aa	any leg excersizes.<br>  lunges,<br>  squats,<br>  running, even.<br>  <br>  <br>  (:
X53EMu0Baa	One of the things that guys are most attracted to is self confidence. Walk tall and proudly. If you act like you have it going on, people think that you do. Cellulite sucks. But so what? It is not you. You didn't choose to have it. If anyone judges you for it, that is their problem. They are just shallow or immature, so no loss. Just walk on. Leave it behind. It means absolutely nothing, and you have better things to do!|`|UcWA30y9aa	Unfortunately there is no cure for this except maybe surgery.  There is a ton of "creams" and "potions" that are sold at some stores that guarantee the removal of cellulite but its a load of crap.  Its your skin type and the only way you may have a chance to lose it, is to lose weight, and you may still have it a little bit!  I know - it sucks cause I have it too!|`|rgCWPPLmaa	Losing a little bit of weight *can* help, even if you're not fat. I have some cellulite when I'm about 10lbs heavier than I am now (I'm 5'8'', 124lbs). When I lose the weight, it's gone!<br>  Please remember that no one's perfect and you have so many other assets, focus on those and don't worry about flaws. Even models have cellulite (I would know :P). <br>  Be proud of your gorgeous, curvy, womanly body, damn it!|`|p1mSR5Awaa	work out is the only solution. sorry|`|dzLLqFz1aa	You cannot target fat it comes off of everywhere gradually. For losing fat diet is about 80% of it while strength resistance training and cardio comprise the other 20%. Get a good routine going for yourself and it can be done, dont quit! I do feel strongly though when I say, "If your not happy its not worth it" make sure its what you want.|`|3WGJdi8zaa	Got 22 minutes spare everyday? Then let me show you how to get rid of cellulite fast<br>  <a href="http://nomorecellulite.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://nomorecellulite.notlong.com</a>|`|pogNXtCiaa	Now there is a certain kind of lotion at walmart that I have used and it works wonders it is quite expensive but i does work|`|qVhqc019aa	Almost every women gets cellulite..and I am sure you look fine! Guys don't really pay attention to the small stuff like dimples and what not, but the best exercise for tightening your thighs is squats! Do like 50 squats a night and it really tightens the toosh and legs :) Also, a diet of lots of vitamen c and fruits and veggies really helps! Best of luck dear, and remember, your beautiful no matter what!<br>  <br>  ?|`|T9fek24eaa	Unfortunately you can not get rid of cellulite. It is connective tissue that lays over the fat and is connected to the muscles underneath... imagine a quilt, 2 sides are sewn together, with the "filler" in between. Some people are dispositioned to it more so than others. Its nothing to be ashamed off... most people (men and women) do have it! Even athletes.
Js0mg82Saa	Heyyy im 14 lol.<br>  i still get discharge..and i got my period when i was 12(it is so annoying)<br>  i think it is completly normal ae..<br>  i think my mum also still gets it. im pretty sure it is just the vaginas natural way of cleaning its self out.. but im not to sure ae.. maybe  try talk to your mum or something..<br>  i hope i helped a bit..|`|XE3qdrGJaa	If you have had any sort of discharge non-stop for the last two years, or even longer than a few days, you need to go see a doctor.  It prob isn't a big deal but you don't want to take any changes!|`|WgvhULEpaa	First off if you are sexually active then you need to talk with your doctor and they will help you through this. Don't be ashamed  or scared trust me you will have many more weird things happen to your body as you get older. Good luck!|`|9xgGd9praa	Discharge is no big deal, I've had my period since I was 11, and I'm now 17, I still get discharge.<br>  Unless it's greenish or seriously smelly there's no problem.|`|ZRu2DxEqaa	It most likely isn't a big deal unless your sexually active. It could be a sign of a std. But discharge on a female is normal. Its your body's natural way of cleaning itself. As gross as the discharge may be really its good for your body.
THWKr8gXaa	There are a few things you can do........<br>  <br>  1.  When you meet someone, look them in the eye when they introduce themselves, repeat their name out loud and try to associate their name or face/special feature to something that hold meaning to you.<br>  <br>  2.  You can learn to focus but looking at a lighted candle for few minutes a day and slowly increase the duration.<br>  <br>  3.  Stay present.  You can check out these 2 books:  The power of now by Eckhart Tolle and The Present by Spencer Johnson.  The second book appears to be child like and very easy to read but both book are equally powerful when fully understood and practiced.<br>  <br>  Good luck
1w5blbobaa	Many situations or activities, such as writing, taking tests, competing in sports, or speaking before a large audience, may make us anxious or apprehensive. It's important to remember that a moderate level of anxiety is helpful and productive. That flow of adrenaline is a natural response that helps get us ready for action. Without it, we might not perform as well.<br>  <br>  If we let our anxiety overwhelm us, it can cause problems. If we control that anxiety, however, we can make it work for us. One way to do that is to use some of the coping strategies listed below.<br>  <br>  COPING STRATEGIES:-<br>  <br>  #Focus your energy by rehearsing the task in your head. <br>  #Consciously stop the non-productive comments running through your head by replacing them with productive ones. <br>  #If you have some "rituals" for writing success, use them. <br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  >Follow a protocol you may have for organizing your time. Use a favorite pen if you have one. <br>  >Spend a few minutes doing some relaxation exercises. <br>  >Take a break: physically walk away from the situation for a few minutes if you can. <br>  <br>  RELAXATION STRATEGIES:-<br>  <br>  #Stretch! If you can't stand up, stretch as many muscle groups as possible while staying seated. <br>  #Try tensing and releasing various muscle groups. Starting from your toes, tense up for perhaps five to ten seconds and then let go. Relax and then go on to another muscle group. <br>  #Breathe deeply. Close your eyes; then, fill your chest cavity slowly by taking four of five short deep breaths. Hold each breath until it hurts, and then let it out slowly. <br>  #Use a calming word or mental image to focus on while relaxing. If you choose a word, be careful not to use an imperative. Don't command yourself to "Calm down!" or "Relax!"<br>  <br>  THIS ARE REALLY USEFULL,DO TRY IT---ALL THE BEST.<br>  <br>  & HOPE IT HELP U.
a804958f4ae350dd48a19bd98ba830a5aa	I would try hydrocortisone cream at first. But you may need to go to the doctor. I had the same thing and needed a cortisone shot and a steroid cream. But try the hydro. cream first. It may be a mild rash. But mine was eczema. <br>  Doctor will know the best.
sD0DFG4haa	You should get an mri to rule out anything serious lack of sleep or to much sleep does cause migraines to get worse though so you should definetly be trying to stick to a schedule
WpH9zProaa	This happens to me as well. They say that a human does not use there brain to its full potential. I think some people randomly tap into this. I have also heard that Deja Vu is little signs to tell you that you are on the right path of your life.|`|o7NQufdTaa	Within a couple days you see the same show or song? Yeah, it's completely normal to have songs stuck in your head at random. I mean heck, I'm 21 and still get songs from cartoons I haven't seen in years stuck in my head. I would say even if it were happening while you were watching tv within about 20 minutes that it popped in your head it would be subconscious recognition of tv scheduling. Or maybe you just weren't paying too much attention to what they said was coming up next on tv but it subconsciously registered and the thought popped into your head.<br>  <br>  As cool as it would be, You're not psychic...hahaha|`|WwVHWz5saa	That happens to me too!! I'll randomly say to someone on msn something totally random that comes into my head.. like about a vacuum cleaner or something. And then a few seconds later I can hear an advert for it on the tv.

Mine sounds a bit stupid but I just can't explain properly|`|rnMZHdCraa	that happens to me, like i was thinking of mistletoe today pretty randomly, then my dad shouts to my mum "i'm just going to get the mistletoe from the car" i was like. whooaaa... weird. lol.|`|YhYSZlroaa	di jevu? that i pretty cool though.

xrq4qKRbaa	I would get advise from your doctor. If your ear gets infected then they can't do the surgery till they get it cleared up.
GXiCrhVYaa	It is an interesting question that actually has a wide variety of answers depending on the individual. What works the best for one person may not be that effective for someone else. <br>  <br>  Meditation is wonderful but if you feel very nervous, it may be hard to calm down the mind and enjoy real peacefulness. Thus, some of the practices  below can be a good place to start.<br>  <br>  What was very helpful to me, especially when my mind was racing, was to sit or lie comfortably and listen to relaxation CDs, especially those that contain someone speaking with relaxing music in the background. Many of these CDs are available on eBay for very low prices.<br>  <br>  People who are more physical can just follow the breathe in and out as they breathe.<br>  <br>  The advantage of yoga is that it first calms the body, which in turn relaxes the mind. <br>  <br>  In fairly extreme cases of nervousness, breathe in and out of a paper bag. Without going into detail, this will relax the diaphram, which  will make breathing easier and more relaxing. <br>  <br>  A helpful meditative technique is to relax your body one part at a time. So you could relax your feet, your lower legs, upper legs, moving up from your lower belly up to your chest, etc., until your whole body is relaxed.<br>  <br>  Of course, guided relaxation methods can help, imagining yourself in the country, the beach, or whatever is most soothing to you. If your mind is already fairly quiet, you can try meditation directly. Some people visualize well. In this case,  visualizing a peacefule place helps. People who are very auditory can use a mantra right away. For example, say "so" when you inhale  and "hum " when you exhale. Alternatives are "sat" when you inhale and "naam" when you exhale. Or you can say "re" as you breathe in and "lax" as you breathe out.  <br>  <br>  There are herbs can can help you relax, eg,  valerian root, kava kava, chamomile, hops, passion flower, skullcap. Probably, valerian root and kava kava are the best. You have to keep in mind that it can take a few weeks for some herbs (including valerian) to build up in your system before they work. <br>  <br>  You can also try 5-HTP, trytophan, or GABA.<br>  <br>  A warm bath is a great way to help you to relax. If you can’t take a bath, you can give yourself a foot massage with slightly warm massage oil, sesame oil, or castor oil from a health food store.<br>  <br>  If you have annoying thoughts or personal issues that run thru your mind, you might have to deal with those issues first. You might want to talk to a counselor or therapist about that. I suggest avoiding prescription sleeping pills unless nothing else helps.|`|rIlpqCzmaa	self guided meditation<br>  close your eyes and breathe through your nose and exhale through you mouth. imagine your favorite outdoor place. while doing that squeeze and hold each individual body part starting from your forehead working your way down to your feet one body part at a time. learned it in college.
hQMiSlvMaa	I know that you know what is making you get fat "we all do" so just by cutting that out of your life you will start to see amazing changes.<br>  <br>  My Problem is that I had a sweet tooth and I loved fast food.  So what I did I stoped having them and Voila I lost 18lb in 1 month.<br>  <br>  Of course I ate the following instead (meat/ chicken/ fish/ eggs/ veggies/ fruits)  I reduced my carbs intake by 80% and drank a lot of water and did mild exercise (which I should do more)<br>  <br>  Don't starve yourself, eat 5 to 6 small meals per day this includes snacking on veggies and fruits.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	This is not a diet but a starvation plan. If you do this diet, I can tell you know that you are not going to stick to it. A healthy diet is eating the proper foods and not just having shakes for a meal. And it would be foolish of you if you try to lose to fast. I think the best thing for you to do it to get into a good diet program with someone you can follow up with. You will also need to exercise so that means you need a good trainer.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	Eat less. Eat often!<br>  Don't starve but eat less. Keep a gap of 2 hours between meals.<br>  <br>  Prefer eating five to six small meals per day, rather than three big meals. To achieve best results.
XxPhbwNfaa	That could be the sign of developing hemorrhoids .  Use Tucks, or baby wipes to completely clean your anus after a bowel movement.  A personal bidet would help you avoid this problem, and by your other questions, would be a positive tool for your fiance as well.<br>  <br>  I'm not a salesman, but Toto makes a very good one.  another is available through Home Depot.  They attach to your existing toilet, as a seat, and wash you front or back with heated water.  Saves on TP as well, as they have a dryer.

lFYtJLgfaa	I've tried ZMA but don't know if it works.  Since they are both cheap, try doing both at the same time.  The younger you are the higher your natural testosterone so the less of an effect (if any) these products will have.  That's assuming that they work.  But what does work for sure are prohormones. Try "RPN Havoc".|`|E64juLwJaa	Better not use them for sexual "health".<br>  They cause that you stop producing testosterone yourself.<br>  So that is no way good.<br>  And those products aren't good to start with anyway<br>  Colors
OBT3C4zHaa	well, they're a little different in each state, but the requirements for me in CA, were:<br>  <br>  1. Take an Emergency Medical Services class. I took this at a community college. I think it was about 3 months long, There was a lot of work involved. <br>  <br>  2. Go on a "ride-a-long" with an EMT crew. This was included in the class, you had to go on one for I think a minimum of ten hours and had to have at least 5 patients treated.<br>  <br>  3. Be certified for CPR. This was also done in the class.<br>  <br>  4. Pass the test they give when the class is completed. You have to get a really high score and it's pretty difficult.<br>  <br>  5. Take a state test. Really hard, a lot of it is hands-on.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that's all, after that you can get hired somewhere, and of course you have to pass a drug test. The class is really difficult but it's worth it. It has a high failure rate.|`|Sz5awVnRaa	First of all it depends on where you live. I live in silver spring, and I am a certified first responder nd planing on taking the EMT class during the summer. Since I took the first responder class, EMT class is supposed to be easier. Honestly though, EMT class is designed to be for anyone without any medical experience so don't worry. Just work hard and study and you'll be fine!
AA10766729	TSS is INSANELY rare...only 1000 cases have been reported in the US since the 80's!!!  If you change your tampon as needed, don't use a tampon more absorbant than you need (in other words, don't use a Super when a Regular will do), and change your tampon at least every 8 hours, your chances of TSS are STUPID-low.  <br>  <br>  And just so you know, tampons are NOT the only way a person can get TSS....and it is not restricted to women.  Men can contract the disease too, as it is a bacterial infection of the blood.<br>  <br>  Also, if you change your tampon too often, you run the risk of causing pain or discomfort when you remove it because the tampon may not have had a chance to absorb enough fluid and it can stick to your vaginal wall causing a LOT of pain. <br>  <br>  Finally, tampon preference is up to you.  You may find one you like right off, or you may have to try several brands till you find one you like.  Personally, I always stuck with Kotex Security; never had a problem with insertion, removal, or leak protection.  And I NEVER got TSS.|`|77NzfiVkaa	There is no tampon that will give you TSS from only wearing it 3 hours. TSS is from wearing a tampon for more than 8 hours or wearing an extremely full tampon without changing it. Any tampon is fine but I prefer Tampax Pearl. Tampons with cardboard applicators are uncomfortable to put in.<br>  <br>  Oh and reading some of these people's answers I must clear some things up. I sleep with a tampon every night of my period and I have never had any problems. So sleeping with a tampon in is fine. Also, tampons cannot get stuck inside of you. They can't go up inside you past your vaginal cavity because the hole is too small.|`|SQekGM8gaa	Ok. I like tampax pearl. If you are just starting get the light ones. there is a . . . size difference, and you won't have a very heavy flow.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	All tampons carry a risk of TSS. However, you should wear them for no longer than 6 hours and that will lower the risk. As far as which tampons have less risk, they are all the same. You just need to pick the brand that works best for you.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	tampax thin ones there good for lighter days too answer hers it will take one second shes making a world record or whatever<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227132706AAEDrZU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OwQsCR4Saa	I suspect you'll get TSS if you never change your tampon.  <br>  <br>  I wear only Playtex.  Tampax seems to be too long.|`|QJHE3z1raa	playtex gentile glide<br>  or playtex sport<33<br>  i can't wear them til summer(but i have)|`|DhUMjZxtaa	First off, no matter what brand or tampon you wear you can contract TSS. If you wear it for 3 hours, most likely that will not happen.<br>  <br>  Second, it depends on your flow if you should even use tampons or not.<br>  <br>  I personally don't use tampons because sometimes my period is so light that even the lightest tampon stays dry...and pulling out a dry tampon, isn't nice.<br>  <br>  In any case, when I used to use them sometimes, but rarely, I used the Tampax pearl...never the cardboard ones I hate those.|`|16bWGB14aa	All tampons can cause TSS but it's unlikely especially if it's only in for 3 hours that's a safe time. Tampons can be in for 4-8 hours but I think it's better to change them within 6 hours. Playtex gentle glides regulars are very comfortable and easy to insert and they have good protection.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	That is a bummer, I wonder why your mom won't let you wear tampons?  Anyhoo, I like the Playtex portable tampons, they are small and have a plastic applicator that is much easier to insert.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	No tampon will give you TSS if worn for 4 hours.  Google Tampax.  They have an interactive website that will tell you all you know about tampons and has games, offers and coupons for when you are ready.  They also send free samples.|`|K5uoaetaaa	Any tampon carries a very small risk of TSS.  Best idea is to use the smallest size that is practical and follow the instructions from the pack carefully.|`|gwUh9mBqaa	well i use tampax cardboard NOT PLASTIC i can leave mine in for around 5-6 hours and nothing has happened to me and i always freak out because i think i am going to get T.S.S but u wont trust me there really good!|`|ph9ZE1veaa	none will if you only wear them for 3 hours.<br>  <br>  i use tampax sport.|`|Uagg9UsFaa	Any kind wil do. No matter what kind you get, you shouldn't keep it in for more than 6 hours (at the most, you really should change it every 4 hours or so). If you keep in in for too long, it can cause TSS, which can cause death (but rarely) and can keep you from being able to get pregnant later in life. I'm not allowed to use tampons either, which can be annoying, but I have tried them and they are really painful to take out, so just wear pads and wait until high school until you make a decision of which is better.|`|AA11506593	Most tampons (USA) are good for up to 8 hours. You should change your tampon when it becomes saturated. Early in your period (perhaps the first 2 days) you will need to change more often. Always buy the tampon for the flow you are having. Do not wear the heaviest absorption tampon on light flow days. Change your tampon at LEAST every 8 hours. No NOT sleep overnight wearing a tampon. Wear a pad at bedtime.<br>  <br>  As for the brand -- it all depends on what you are comfortable with. I swear by O.B. as they have no messy hard applicators to deal with.|`|TCVKpfeJaa	Well any tampon CAN give you toxic shock syndrome, but it is unlikely.  I mean, as long as you insert it correctly, and change it frequently its fine.  If you can't change it frequently, you shouldn't wear them.  What's more embarrassing: feeling like you are wearing a diaper, or forgetting to change it and bleeding all over yourself?|`|93LSvxduaa	You can get TSS from any of them, but only if you leave them in for a long period of time. (like 8 or more hrs.) You should be able to wear a tampon for about 4 hrs before it needs to changed. unless your a heavy bleeder. Also they have different ones, for light days or really heavy days. So if its a light day then use a regular absorbsancy. ect..|`|PTWnWkPRaa	if you have a heavy flow, you might want to use tampons, talk to your mom about this. pads are ok if you arnt doing any sports.

In general, higher absorbency leads to a higher rate of TSS.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	A heart murmur is a abnormal sound heart during the normal flow of blood.  It can be caused by narrowing or leaking valves, defects and a few other reasons.  Something to keep in mind that's a med student not a doctor.  While they're on the road to be a doctor they still 1 year of med school and 4 years of on the job training called residency to go and residency is where the learning really begins.  I think I just heard one and I just heard one are 2 different things and he should have just kept it to himself.  If your that concerned about it then talk to your doctor, keep in mind if your doctor didn't say anything at the time of your visit after that med student assessed you that should be a hint things are fine.  Personally I think you shouldn't sweat it however I've always tried to have a policy of not sweating the small stuff.|`|AA12225723	Its probably nothing and worrying won't help it any.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes, when coming off progestogen only contraceptives (particularly Depro Provera), it can take awhile for your cycle to re-establish itself. I think after 18 months there is justification here for you to see your GP. Absent periods (Amenorrhea) is only really a problem if you are trying to conceive as it can indicate that you are not ovulating, however it is still possible, so still use contraception if you do not wish to become pregnant.|`|VmpkLLKJaa	I took it in HS for about 1 year and 1/2.

EeTs9DqUaa	Was that a fasting blood test or a random blood test.  If it was fasting you are considered pre diabetic, if it was random it was normal.  Don't think of diabetes as a sugar intake disease because it is not.  Given your under height condition :) if there is a family history of diabetes you need to take action now.  The best way for you to drop the extra weight is to go on a low carb diet such as Atkins or the south beach.  Also start walking, 15 minutes a day this week, 15 minutes 2 times a day next week and try to work one of them to 30 minutes a day and 1 15 minutes a day.  You will not drop as fast as on the TV show the biggest loser, but remember you did not put all that extra weight on in 6 months either.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Your blood sugar is normal.  You are not diabetic.  You are more likely to get diabetes because you are overweight.  Sugar is not the issue as much as carbohydrates in general.  Count carbs at meals and try to keep your carb count at about 30 grams of carbs at each meal.  Read all nutrition labels and measure food to get an accurate carb count.<br>  A simple and effective way of losing weight and keeping carbs under control is to keep a food diary. Write evey single thing down that you eat and how many carbs are in the food.  Aim to keep this under 100 a day.  Doing this will also help you lose weight because many low carb foods are low in calories.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	You better drink 12-15 glasses of water a day.

Drinking lukewarm water is more effective to lower your sugar level. Be sure to sleep early for you need to have 8-hour sleep. Lessen your rice intake.  But you can eat in a regular manner.

If your period doesn't show up after a couple of months and you're still getting pain like this instead of a period then you need to go to a doctor. Of course if the pain continues without a break then you need to go to the doctor. Good luck!

My first one was about 8 days long and then after that it was 4 days and now they are regular and are between 5-7 days. So it's not unusual for yours to do that.|`|ivjHOJ8daa	Everybody's different!<br>  For a first period, that is completely normal!<br>  <br>  It takes roughly 5 years for a female to get into a regular menstrual cycle!|`|qQxRDl59aa	If this is your first time having your first period and it's lasted 10 days, it's completely normal. Welcome to puberty. The first time is always longer because your body and your hormones are adjusting. After your first period, your cycle will be regular and will vary in days. It's usually 7-10 days. Your mom has had a period for a long time, so it's normal for her to have a 3 day period. She will probably go through menopause soon, or probably there. Don't worry about hers though. It's normal for you.|`|XadcGNGnaa	This is your first ever period, you mum has probably had them for around 30 years or more.

ERx11AsCaa	It is normal for a 14 yr old to have sore tender or swollen breast. This is due to puberty. However if your breast look like they are growing you may be producing more estrogen than testosterone which is one of the causes of man boobs. <br>  <br>  At your age since your body is growing it is not recommended to lift weights to build your chest, however exercising would be of great benefit as would a proper diet designed to build muscle and lose fat.<br>  <br>  A great program which I heard is very good for helping rid you of your man boobs is "Get This Off My Chest"  I have included a link for you|`|NOll7Bxkaa	you sure your not just self conscious?

dcb0c032d3b6c037f3cfdb4dac72663eaa	Because you felt sick before your shows, and then felt better after the shows, I think that part was 'nerves'. However, when a person is under stress, the immune system is depressed and the person is then more likely to catch a virus or other 'bug'. I think during your initial stress you 'came down with something'. Since you are going from warm to chills, have you taken your temp? Because repeated chills can be   a sign of fever. <br>  <br>  So it seems like you had two things: first nervousness and stress, and then on Sunday you had a 'bug' which could take a few days to get over. <br>  <br>  Do you have any other symptoms? I suggest you do eat something, like Sprite (not Diet) or other clear liquid with some sugar in it.  Also try some chicken broth to get salts back in your system.  When you are having chills and sweats you lose more liquids and salts than you would think, and it's important to replace them.  Avoid fruit juice which is kind of acid and could upset your tummy.  If you are keeping food down, next have some clear broth with rice, and meanwhile keep on having some liquids like the Sprite or herbal tea with sugar.<br>  <br>  At least it's nothing serious!! Get well soon!  :)|`|2Y9pejG6aa	Sounds like you need to go see a doctor.  You might have glandular fever...?

Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Within 90 days you should be able to tell quite a difference.

Hair loss due to infection may require oral antibiotics or antifungals. Alopecia areata can be treated with injections of steroids such as triamcinolone into the area. For all of the causes, early treatment works the best.<br>  <br>  For hair loss caused by androgenic alopecia, there is no cure, although many treatments are available. Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription hair loss treatment that is prescribed for men only. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is rubbed directly onto the scalp and works for both men and women. It usually works best for hair loss at top and back of the scalp, where there is still some remaining hair. This is available over the counter at most pharmacies.<br>  <br>  Well chosen hairstyles can often hide hair loss effectively. Partial hairpieces or wigs are recommended if hair loss is severe.<br>  <br>  Finally, hair transplantation has improved dramatically over the last several years. During a hair transplant, healthy hairs are harvested from an area of the scalp with normal hair growth. Individual hairs are then placed into areas of hair loss.

Although shampoo is not directly responsible for hair loss if it is a really bad shampoo with a poor pH level it can damage your hair and even in some cases cause damage to your scalp. A good pH is between 5.5 and 8.5.<br>  <br>     I would stay well away from chemical treatments like propecia. they have numerous side effects including impotence. I never knew about these side effects until I started taking it and I was fortunate that they disappeared when I stopped taking it.<br>  <br>  One of the best things you can do is to take hair supplements.

AA11002791	3500 calories are in 1 pound.  Your very skinny.  When I was 15 I became very sick and only weighed 87 pounds.  Eventually, I dated then got married and ate more food, like Pasta, Pizza (Thick Crust), Snacked, and drove everywhere instead of walking. After I had a couple of kids, I gained more weight then I should.  Now I need to exercise and eat less carbs and snacks to lose the weight.  So in short, be careful when you gain the weight, because it will be very difficult to loose it when you get older and your metabolism slows down.|`|CCyvAXYRaa	EAT SOME FREAKIN TWINKIES,<br>  IS IT REALLY THAT HARD?<br>  LIKE SRSLY?

Organic Milk is really tasty and free of Pesticides. if you want to gain weight gain slowly. Take some EFA's each day. Take some Coconut Oil in capsule form each day. its great for your skin and it will keep you from getting stretch marks if you gain to quick, but it helps you look young, always. good health habits should start now. always exercise at least 3 times a week.

AA11004036	Sometimes starting birth control can mess with your hormonal levels and cause you to start a new cycle. Because taking the pill schedules your ovum release and for your uterus to start shedding the lining(Your Period) on or around the  20th day in your pill pack, so to get it your period on the 18th sounds pretty correct to me, My recommendation would be to continue your pills and use extra protection when it comes to intercourse. Your next expected period on a 28day cycle would be March 18th and if you thought there may be a possibility you were pregnant your due date would be November 25 2009. Good Luck
ECLYzIXZaa	No. My wife was taking oxycodone,but now there seems to be a shortage so her Doctor has taking her off the oxycodone and put her on dilaudid.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Dilaudid is stronger than morphine and is given to patients other than cancer patients.  Usually it is given when morphine hasn't helped.|`|xMlL7CKcaa	Dilaudid is given for moderate to severe pain discomfort.  Many without cancer are on dilaudid pain meds.  I was on the highest dose possible due to pain from my lung cancer for nearly 18 months.  I am now weaning myself off of them.  So no, its not just given to cancer patients that only have a short time left to live.

There is skin surrounding your vagina to protect it.

htBHCNDtaa	Ok the pill varies.<br>  There are pills for $20 and some that are almost $70. Usually the average price is $50, such as Valette, Diane. You can also get the 'generic brand' of certain pills, they will ask you this at the counter if you would like a generic brand because it's cheaper. They'll also say it's exactly the same, but I would not recommend getting it. It is the same when it comes to contraception, but if you're also using it to control acne, the generic brand may not have those ingredients.<br>  <br>  Also, you do require a prescription for it. Just go to your doctor and tell him why you would like to use it such as contraceptive, but also helping reduce period pain and acne.|`|GApjwrnJaa	Well, i'm pretty sure no matter where you live, a prescription is required for the pill. I'm not sure about the cost, but google around for it, you'll find an answer eventually.

The burning sensation goes along with this. My cure is to drink as much concentrated lemon juice in water as you can. It flushes the urinary tract and is good for kidneys and bladder. I like it better than the cranberry juice. It is good for preventatives. If yours has gone too far, you will need a round of antibiotics.<br>  The sex thing can do this if you use too much gel that could coat your insides, but wouldn't explain the burning.<br>  A sist on the ovary will cause pain like that also.

6In638rbaa	Yeah I know that feeling...take it from a college student. Studying is basically our life. It's hard to study something that totally doesn't interest you the slightest bit. But just make the studying method more fun, for example, make flashcards rather than reading a whole chapter. Be creative in your studying. =)|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Don't we all?  Drink some coffee.|`|RYmOHy7Caa	i asked this same question a while ago...and now im fine. heres what i did.<br>   Don't lay down when you read. Try sitting up, preferably on a hard surface like a wood or metal chair. If you consume caffeine before you start reading, you might be able to stay awake longer, but it might also affect your ability to concentrate. I would suggest eating while you read. Make some popcorn or eat potato chips, corn nut, anything like that where you can stil concentrate on the literature, but have something to keep your hands and mouth busy. Also, try not to read right after a meal or in a warm room, as both can lead to sleepiness. You may also want to try reading either in the morning or the middle of the day when you have the most engery. Reading at night, especially right after dinner, probably isn't the best plan for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your reading.

If you really want to quit, you will say no and mean it when your friends puff...puff...pass.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	wow you do not have "friends" those arent friends.

How it is harming you?  Has it made you less of a person?  Has it made you a bad citizen?  How do you hate it?  ((seriously, more info in needed, so add details))<br>  <br>  First advice is to make sure your girlfriend, who get's upset when you smoke instead of supporting you, is the right girl for you.  If so, and you still want to quit because of her then...<br>  <br>  I don't find it hard to stop smoking.  Just give yourself more to do, keep yourself busy.  Join a rugby team in your city.  Or anything else that will take up more of your free time and give you an excuse not to smoke.  Be fun with your friends when you don't smoke.  Don't look down on them or try to kill their buzz.  Just laugh with them and try to make their experience better.  They are your friends right?  Let yourself cheat some times.  You'll get used to walking away from it, so slipping won't hurt.  Don't take up drinking or any other altering substance.  You won't walk away from them like you will from weed.  <br>  <br>  If want to try a different way of getting high with weed that doesn't have any harmful side effects, doesn't smell, is painless(no hot ash in your lungs), and results in more active cerebral highs, try a vaporizer.  I suggest something along the lines of the Herbalaire.  Do some research on what you think you want from your vaporizer before you buy.<br>  <br>  Good luck with life man|`|tCnETE4caa	You call that your friends and relationships?? its depressing, destructive and sad.

Zsc1Esxvaa	The same way you quit smoking COLD TURKEY!. Honestly this is the only way to get over it. Nicotine stays in your body for about 4-5 days with day 3 being the hardest to get past. You can probably identify triggers that encourage you to chew, for me and smoking it was talking on the phone, driving, or drinking. At first you should try and avoid whatever those triggers are but I promise you that if you do it this way and make it through the week you can go forever and never do it again. Be strong and do not use any other nicotine to deal with it you will only change your form of nicotine addiction.|`|Xx0Xsgwzaa	see a counselor or muster up enough discipline to stop. only you can prevent chewing tobacco!|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Mouth cancer, is the worst way of dying, you end up slowly starving to death !

NxLmvKtJaa	First consult a doctor to make sure that you do not risk hurting yourself prior to doing any type of workout regiment.  If you are trying to get back in shape, slow and steady is your best bet.  don't try to do it in leaps and bounds or you will wear yourself out.  I once weight 185 and needed to get back in shape.  Wasn't much of a gym rat so I decided to start running again.  The first couple of weeks were rough, but after awhile I got my pace down.  I started running 15 minutes every other day, then I bumped it up to 20, then 25, 30, then 45.  By the end of the first month I was running 45 minutes every other day.  When I got use to that I switched up my workout regiment and began running for 15 mins, then working out at the gym for 30 mins.  I would do lateral pulls, sit ups, push ups, and anything else that felt good.  <br>  <br>  I took me about 2 months but I lost 15 pounds and was in great shape.  Take it slow and easy, consistency is your best bet.  And with a family to look after, you won't have to go too far out of your way to stay in shape.  1 hour every other day is all you'll need.|`|dzLLqFz1aa	get on a weight resistance and cardio program. also diet is 80% of it so eat how you want to look.|`|rB82Ujlgaa	you have 2 children and weigh 132 that is good for a mother.

513708e4dfd3b88a9b7ce59087ef82aeaa	It can be a number of issues! These are the commons ones I deal with all the time. Here are some of the reasons<br>  <br>  1. Plumbing. Highly chlorinated water is best. It is less likely to create algae stains, and carry bacteria. If you notice red staind in your shower, thats algae. I have learned that when I shower in places such as this my vagina gets irritated.<br>  <br>  2 Dryness... mosturize! Serisously. Use Petroleum jelly, or something. Avoiding dryness will prevent the next problem<br>  <br>  3.A break/scratch in the skin. When Im even slighty dry down there, a simple brush against my rough jeans or too rough of a wipe, ANYTHING will break my skin. When your dry you have a tendency to get itchy and therefor scratch, even rubbing can break the skin. The irritation that then occurs will make you feel even more like scratching. This is resolved I have found by using Neosporin + Pain Relief. It heals, and becuase it also contains petroleum jelly it mosturizes. I dont know if the 'Pain relief' part does anything. <br>  <br>  These are the precautions I take to avoid 'itchness', I dont get this feeling any other times besides that. My skin also breaks during sex so I have to stay very lubricated.<br>  <br>  All in all NEVER scratch, keep it mosturized, but Dry, wear cottonunderwear, and when there is even the smallest scratch, HEAL!|`|rj1MwJYzaa	move! to a better place with better plumbing or just wash down there with cold water. and the itching could just be thrush or something. go to the pharmacy and you can pills for that and wash down there regularly with a gentle soap as in twice a day, morning and night. and make sure not to wear tight underwear.

ZRu2DxEqaa	Sweetie sometimes the best love is tough love. If you know he is using drugs maybe you should call the cops on him. They can give him a ua and if it comes back dirty he could get arrested for a short period of time. I know this sounds harsh but maybe its what he needs. Maybe if he has to do some time he will get his act together.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Ask him what is wrong !|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	I don't want to offend, but it sounds like your son is a bit spoiled.  $1500. ALLOWANCE? Private schools? Sounds like he doesn't appreciate any of the things he has, and only by losing them will he (maybe) come around.  He has to get the money to buy drugs and such somewhere - if you cut off the money, then his girlfriend isn't going to be paying for everything forever.  At some point he'll have to get a job and it won't take long to realize he should have stayed in school.  I would be tempted to lock his butt out of the house, but that might be a little extreme just yet.  If I were you I'd hide anything of value and make sure you don't leave his belongings where he can find them - hide them in the trunk of your car or at work if you have to. By the way, the girlfriend IS in a position of authority since she's living on her own and she can get him to do whatever she wants BECAUSE she has her own place and is contributing to his delinquency.  She is the only reason he isn't in school, etc. What is the drinking age in Canada?  I'm sure it's not 16....he's got to be getting the alcohol somewhere.  Might want to check into it from that angle...

Most guys have a curve, often to the left, and sometimes up. <br>  There are so many variations that there cannot be a solid rule.<br>  There is one man-made problem that can cause excessive curvature and that is circumcision.  I do not know if that is the case with you.  Often, during infant circumcision, the doctor takes off way too much skin (anything is too much) and make uneven cuts, and generally does a sloppy job.  The problems do not manifest themselves until the child becomes a teenager and is left to live with the problem of ugly scars, skin bridges, and uneven tension on the skin.  This uneven tension will pull the penis to one side, more than normal.<br>  The only thing you can do for this is start a process of foreskin restoration.  The skin is stretched over a period of time, and will eventually, if you stay with it, cover the end of the penis, like a normal foreskin.  This is a do-able process.  I am doing it myself.<br>  The choice is to restore enough skin that you have some looseness, to relieve the curvature, or you can continue on to complete restoration.<br>  Start out reading on the site listed below, and if you are interested, I have lots more information I can pass on via links to informative sites.<br>  Good luck with this and feel free to write to me through this site|`|SywNgORPaa	You can't really.

Shoes with bottom soles, are pretty subtle, and can increase your height by at least an inch. You can always add comfort soles inside your shoes to give a little oomph to your height as well. There's another way to make you look taller, but not give you additonal height. I'm not sure if you would like to follow through with this one, but if you wear shirts (like wife-beaters) that are super long (but not too long to the point that it looks messy), it makes you look LONGER, which makes you look taller. Avoid shorts that go beyond your knee. That makes you look so much shorter. <br>  <br>  CONFIDENCE CONFIDENCE CONFIDENCE. It doesn't have to challenge you mentally.

Sometimes family practice MD's are good at this as well.  There are a lot of medical interventions available to help quit smoking, but ultimately you have to be 100% committed to quit cold turkey.  If you are relying on a product to make you quit, you'll fail.  Once you decide that YOU are going to quit, then these products can help.  My first advice is to wean yourself down to 9 cigarettes per day.  Once you get down to that level, you need to make the decision to stop completely.  All of these products have pros/cons and their success rate varies between 4%-15% success rate long term.  If you use a drug like bupropion (Zyban & Wellbutrin) or Chantix, you will probably be successful at quiting for a month or two, beyond that its up to you to stay quit.  You can try nicotine replacement therapies like gum, patches, lozenges, sublinqual tablets, inhalers, and nasal sprays.  Their main differences are due to the rate at which nicotine is absorbed.  For example some will give you the nicotine fix almost immediately (nasal spray, inhaler), but other methods provide a more steady, low level of nicotine absorption (patches).  These differences have pros/cons depending on how you look at it.  The nasal spray will be very effective at first, but then you still have to quit the nasal spray.  And the patch will be tough at first, but if it works it is easier to eventually stop the patch.  The drug bupropion is also considered an antidepressant, and it's mechanism of action isn't clear but it has a relatively high success rate. Chantix is the newest drug that acts by binding to the same nicotinic receptors in your brain.  I beleive it has a 12 hour half life.  It is categorized as a "partial agonist", which means that when it binds to the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor in the brain it will release a small amount of dopamine which is what the actual nicotine does, thus providing a little relief from cravings, and in addition it blocks the receptor so that if you did smoke it wouldn't satifsy your craving anyway.  In a sense it forces you to quit.  The success rate of Chantix is slightly better than bupropion at 6 weeks out.  But ultimately, the long term success depends on you.|`|bY58V3oraa	Have you heard of the new electronic cigarettes?  There was a story about them on Yahoo about a week ago.  I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  And I bought two packs of cigarettes today that cost me more than $12.  That’s just crazy!  So I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.|`|dog1vQNBaa	Nicotine chewing gum are very helpful if you really want to quit smoking. My friend used them and finally he gave up smoking.

Patches and gum are crutches that you should use if you need them, but be prepared to quit using them as soon as possible.  One of the most powerful tools you can use once you decide to quit is to tell your friends, family, co-workers, etc. that you have quit - - this plants the idea deeper in your own mind that you do not smoke.   Congratulations  on your decision to give up that habit.|`|PzWN9jtHaa	Keep a rubber band around your wrist.

bTfR8OnDaa	It will take your body a few months to get use to being back on the birth control. Give it another month or two for your body to get back in sync with the medicine.

That might be where the difference is. Your body will change over time, and I think it is just re-adjusting to the pill. As for the financial troubles... ask your doctor if they have any samples of the birth control they can give you. My doctor usually gives me my birth control that way, so I don't have to pay for it.

I understand you feelings and I would suggest looking into alternations birth control me
w9uMC95Laa	If your pee is super dark like brownish or if its "foggy" you should go and get it checked out as sooon as possible. Because then it is your kidneys.<br>  <br>  I get random pains in my kidneys like that too.<br>  It could just mean that you need to drink more water.
N3t7uv1saa	Is it regular at the wrist?  Probably, so it could be stress-try relaxation exercises,  low blood volume- take more liquids, anemia- better diet, Anger- try stress reduction exercises, anxiety-try relaxation and think about what is going on inside your head.  If it continues for hours on end and never slows down you should see an MD.

All I can say is you have at least 7 more years of puberty left with the possibility of having more growth.  Anything is possible but there are no guarantee's.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and NOT before.  The keyword here is PATIENCE!|`|E64juLwJaa	You are in the early stages of puberty and you will grow more:but by how much is determined by your genes<br>  Men can grow till their early twenties :so you have years of growing left<br>  So you will get taller<br>  Colors.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	You will grow upwards till your 19ish.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

But if he takes it without having slept, his mind can play tricks on him when it comes to some of the math/logic questions.|`|XpnnNLkOaa	Any rest is better than none.  ASVAB is relatively easy, but important.|`|BRDjdD7Vaa	The best thing to do before a major test is to get at LEAST 8 hours of sleep (assuming you're somewhere near the teen years). If you can't, though, some hours are better than none. Your best bet at this point is to get some sleep, wake up an extra half hour early, get a shower, and get some food. Bright lights and movement will help his body realize it's definitely time to be awake, and will cause a release of hormones in his body that will help keep him going. If he can, a short walk or run before he gets ready for the day might also help. Good luck to him on his test!|`|Lgc9SGfkaa	Or say screw it and sign up for the next test.<br>  Here are 3 page website to learn more about it<br>  Need to please you very much<br>  <a href="http://medicinenet-enzin.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://medicinenet-enzin.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://condom-enzin.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://condom-enzin.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://hydropathyonline.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hydropathyonline.blogspot.com/</a>

NdaU2BMXaa	Nowadays there are rubs, scrubs, wraps, lotions and miracle diets that "promise" to get rid of your cellulite. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the hype, but rather commit yourself to a clean diet and proper amounts of exercise, trying exercises that target the problem area.<br>  <br>  By combining fat burning workouts like cardio and muscle intensive training like squats and leg exercises with free weights, it is possible to stop the storing of fatty tissue and help to smooth out the appearance of cellulite. Also limiting the amount of unhealthy fat in your diet, will limit the amount of fat storage on your body. Eat more fruits, green vegetables and lean protein so your body will utilize all it needs from what you eat and store nothing. After all eating green will help you stay lean! That doesn't mean you can't enjoy an odd treat now and then, but why not keep those treats on the healthy side as well?<br>  <br>  Enjoy and remember, keep your goals realistic and your view of your body based upon health rather than what others define as acceptable. Your body is a wonderful machine, and remember Cellulite is simply a fat that is natural and one that through a healthy diet and exercise you can get rid of!<br>  <br>  Be good to your body, you only have it once!<br>  ok???|`|usIUgISsaa	palmers cocnaut oil from Albertsons|`|yHCAB60Paa	run... thats the best exercise. run and eat healthy.|`|I8Cvacjsaa	<a href="http://nomorecellulite.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://nomorecellulite.notlong.com</a>  All you need is sometime to get rid of cellulite, 22 minutes per day should do the trick.

5f5bdda9f22a52bc94cd6a38f328275daa	The 2-3 times before you go to sleep is probably a mental thing -- you're just nervous about the thought of having to get up and go during the night, so your brain tells you to go again "just in case" squeezing those last few drops out will help you make it through the night.  (It probably won't, of course, but there's really not much you can do about that unless you just lay there, ignore the sensation, and force yourself to go to sleep... which can be easier said than done!)<br>  <br>  Having to go once during the night 4 hours in is pretty normal for a lot of people.  It sounds like you have an excellent metabolism based on your workout habits -- which means that your body will "process" liquids faster than most people's -- and you may also just have a smaller than average bladder.  The way you describe your bladder being full during the night and in the morning doesn't sound like an infection (which would make you feel the need to go when your bladder wan't full), nor a mental thing -- it just sounds like your bladder is getting filled to its maximum capacity, and it's waking you up because it can't hold any more.  Unfortunately if your bladder is small there's not a whole lot you can do about that -- you can try making yourself hold on a little longer during the day (and only go when you REALLY need to go), which can get your bladder accustomed to holding a little bit more urine consistently... and that might help you hold it a little bit longer at night.  If your bladder actually is overactive (a specialist -- urologist -- could tell you for sure) there are also medications that can help with that -- and you're not too young for an overactive bladder necessarily, it can happen to either sex at any age.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just try to be sane about your water intake -- a gallon a day might be a BIT much, but don't withhold fluids enough to let yourself get dehydrated (that will only cause you to produce more concentrated urine, which will irritate the bladder more!).  At night you could try sports drinks (Gatorade, etc) in place of some of the water -- those will keep your electrolyte balance a little more constant, so your kidneys won't feel the need to send all the extra water to your bladder immediately.  Also stay away from caffeine (coffee, soda and energy drinks) anywhere close to bedtime, as those cause vastly increased urine production and also irritate the bladder.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps! :)|`|kFKA8SXraa	Seek a second or third medical opinion.......try this:<br>  30 min before ging to sleep drink 2 glasses of water, do not go to the bathroom until 1 min before you fall asleep,,,,,,,trust me this will help......this will give you a true sensation fo being empty.........if during the night you still feel the need, hold it as much as you can you will be surprised........|`|THWKr8gXaa	I suggest you to go to a different doctor.  Your problem may be a habit you pick up from young, if so this can be simply fixed by changing the habit, slowly but surely.

EtUkys6Waa	Try over the counter Magnesium tablets.  They come in 250mg  up to 500mg.  Take 750mg to 1000mg a day for three days - if this helps then reduce the number you take to find the right balance.  I am an RN, and when I had leg pain my doctor kept checking my potassium levels - but it was Magnesium that helped.  Hope this helps you too.

HqU5gw7Oaa	Though I am not a dentist, I do believe it is not beyond reason. From my understanding it would be better if you kept the roots of the original teeth and just got caps. Other than that, it would likely be a form of dentures. I am pretty certain we cannot replace the roots of teeth successfully, currently. <br>  <br>  Issue might be with getting your fabricated teeth to fit with each other and not cause any damage to your mouth. <br>  <br>  I am not sure about the metal.

xnZi0i8saa	I have been bipolar since my early teens but wasn't diagnosed until I had my forst full blown mania at 40. <br>  <br>  Lamictal is a mood stabilizer. and it works more for the depression thatn for the mania. It is used for Bipolar disorder and it does help more with depression than mania so if you are typically depressed it may help a lot. If you are bipolar then antidepressants are not a good idea as they can cause you to become manic which may be why he is avoiding them. Thus the Lamictal Route. Since it is something he already suspects it won't take years but still may takes months to make a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  The only side effects I have from the Lamictal are some memory problems that have not gone away with time. Make sure he is tapering you up very slowly and if you start to forget things like how to tie your shoes..... don't increase the dose anymore and contact your doc. The only other issue with Lamictal are rashes. most of them are harmless but there is the very rare person that has a life thereatening rash..... you sound like you'v edone your research. Don't let it scare you but be aware of what is happening as far as side effects.<br>  <br>  Lamictal has been a lifesaver for me.|`|oojO4WAraa	Your husband is right - just because he gave you bipolar medication doesn't mean you are bi polar.  It is probably that the doctor has used that medication with lots of other people and has had success and few adverse reactions and thinks it is a good place to start with you.  It is all a gamble, anyway, whether or not a particular medication will work for a particular patient.  <br>  <br>  I had a friend that became bi polar at about 22 after a string of particularly traumatic events in her life.  Maybe she was bi polar all along and the events brought the bi polar out - no one really knows.  Might be the same with you - you have always been bi polar and it is just now showing up.  Or perhaps the doctor is completely off base on this, you are not bi polar, and the meds won't do a thing for you.  Or maybe the you aren't bi polar and the meds will help with what ever is going on with you - meds can be used to treat different things, and even off-label uses.  <br>  <br>  Take the meds for a while and see if they help.  The doctor probably prescribed this medication because he has had good luck using it with his patients in the past.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TdqeC0vmaa	Well if you are seeing someone whom you are going to be seeing for quite some time this isn't that unusual.<br>  <br>  Your likely correct that he was asking you questions related to some form of bipolar. Based on whatever previous medical history he has of you and what he attained from that one time meeting he may have an inkling that bipolar may be the cause. It isn't uncommon for medications to be tried tested adjusted in levels and switched multiple times for months before any medication regime is set in stone. <br>  <br>  Your psychologist-therapist is going to be more likely to give you a diagnosis than your psychiatrist. And this will take time. Often a psychiatrist is solely a medical doctor treating symptoms of illness that just happen to be mental illness. They try to acquire a history and specific symptoms and match you to medications that treat those symptoms. For whatever reason he thought lamictal might help you with your symptoms. If it doesn't you might be switched to something else. <br>  <br>  If you have questions about why you are being given a specific medication it is important to ask as many questions as you need. That is what your paying them for..<br>  <br>  also here are some things you may not know about lamictal<br>  <br>  - it is also shown to be effective treatment for those who have failed to respond to antidepressants. <br>  <br>  so perhaps your depression has been difficult and unresponsive to various medications and so the psychiatrist is testing the waters to see if lamictal will help your depression where antidepressants have not. <br>  <br>  -lamictal is also a successful treatment for some people with unipolar depression. IE not bipolar just depression. <br>  <br>  <br>  So you may be being treated for depression in a not so conventional way. <br>  But if you have questions regarding your therapy and medications its important to ask your docs|`|nUD25qDbaa	I was diagnosed 6 months ago with bi-polar hypo-mania.

Good Luck|`|FKMKQbqPaa	there are different levels of bipolar.  doctors are on the look out for high functioning bipolar.  in these cases they wont have severe symptoms.  studies are showing that people respond best if given the meds quickly.  the longer they wait, the more damage is done, and so doctors that feel this way are often quick to put you on meds.<br>  <br>  i am bipolar.  they perscribed lamictal but it was too expensive.  i have to pick up a new one they phoned in, but i can't recall the name.  anti depressants are proving to have serious limitations.  they usually lose effectiveness with time, mood stabilizers like lamictal are proving to be a better option.  just from what i understand.

I suspect it is he who is being selfish by punishing you for something you can't control. If you start receiving your benefits from SSDI you can move and leave.<br>  People consider others that commit suicide to be selfish because suicidal people are so overwhelmed by their problems that they don't consider the impact that their death will have on others. But, there are two sides to that coin, people don't realize the amount of emotional pain that suicidal  people live with. There is help out there, it takes some effort, but it's there for the taking. Best of luck...|`|9qiLZp50aa	Wow! You're the first person to agree with  me on that! <br>  But they believe its selfish because instead of just pushing through it they leave all the love ones behind.

Good luck|`|f2J7jhlraa	ive attempted suicide 3 times and i saw how much it would be selfish of me if i wouldve actually done it because i woul have hurt my friends and family,i wouldve kept them from all the good times we share and it would take away their happiness that they felt around me.i wouldve put a hole in their life--thats where i once was..i thought too that i didnt matter and like they could get over it in time,which maybe they could but if someone is so valuable to someone,that wouldnt be possible.and sometimes i get to the place that suicide feels the only answer but then i stop and think how i would take away especially my familys happiness especially my mom--my dad just passed away 7 months ago and i know how much grief i feel so i think how much pain my mom would feel if i wasnt here..im sure your dad loves you and he wants the best for your life,and he probably worries about you.we never get to old that our parents stop caring for us..im 33 and still live at home and i still go through things but i found talking to my therapist helps alot, actually he seems like my best friend sometimes and like hes the only one that understands how i feel..please dont try suicide or think it,talk to someone about it...good luck|`|5a53597b35fdc5dc71a7d05a4b52d836aa	Sometimes ppl dont understand the pain ur going through.

You can do what you want with your life but it is connected to other ppl-s lives, so you cannot do something and think it is just YOUR life, bcs everyone is connected together through society.<br>  <br>  Second of all, of course you think this way bcs as you wrote down, you life is like mentioned above. I don't want to tell you what to do, bcs I donno you and your life. Just think about one thing before you do anything: you were given a life, you were given the chance to live, and many others weren't. Many were killed as babies, or small children, many have AIDS and other big sicknesses that they never chose for themselves. Although you have a bad situation too, you are still in a better condition than many millions. You should try to respect this and be happy for that small thing you have. About your father, probably he will never understand...just try to leave him somehow and stand on your won two feet. Probably it will be much harder, but isn't it better to say you have tried than to just sit there in the house and watch yourself slowly age without doing nothing? If you have a chance to live, then try to really live, even if it means pain...but later gain...Wish you all the best!|`|MGLHWUsgaa	You are absolutely correct, your life is your own.  While we generate relationships, friends etc.. it is all for the point of making us happy.<br>  <br>  That said, I sense that you are unhappy.  Rather than make a decision to give up, why not make the decision to be happy?<br>  <br>  How might you do this?  Well, find out what makes you happy, what you need to be happy, and BE HAPPY.<br>  <br>  First though, go see a doctor to ensure that your depression is not a result of some bodily hormone being low.  If it is a physical thing, then you medicate to make yourself less depressed.  If it isn't a physical thing, it is a mental thing.  Mental things can be controlled.  If you are unhappy, then you have a choice:  wallow in your own self-created misery, or end this misery that you have created.<br>  <br>  Please end such misery in a positive way.|`|c695e3d842e5ce7f37359934a75d6b3caa	It is a cowardly and selfish act.  You do not have to spend your life making others happy.  If you are you need to re-evaluate.  At 34 no one chooses your path but you alone.  You may be living in that home-but you are an adult.  Your dad needs to back off.  You need to grow up and move out and take control of your life.  You need to realize suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Suicide is not an answer.  Try talking with a counselor to help get past you hopelessness you are deep into.  Depression is a serious problem.  Start by moving out accross town.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	Suicide is a selfish thing to do in most cases. The reason people say this is because those that are left behind a left questioning: "Could I have done something?" "Why couldn't they talk to me?" etc. Imagine if you received a phone call tomorrow saying your best friend killed themselves. How would you feel?<br>  <br>  However, in cases of euthanasia, where people decide, because of health conditions, to end their lives it' a little different. As long as you take the time to talk to those who love you and explain your decision, it's not as selfish. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should talk to your Dr and see if there are some organizations in your community that might be able to help you have a more independent life. Maybe explain to your dad how you feel, that you're contemplating suicide because you feel. that you have no life. Please, make sure you exhaust all other options before you do something you can't take back.<br>  <br>  As far as him not allowing you to get on disability: you are an adult, you can make that decision for yourself.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Its selfish that you couldn't talk to anyone about your problems, it might cure your issues but it causes **** load of them for other people.

It describes episodic disorders where mood and schizophrenic symptoms are both present but a diagnosis of schizophrenia or depressive or manic episodes is not warranted.[1][1] The disorder usually begins in early adulthood and rarely diagnosed in childhood (prior to age 13). Schizoaffective disorder is more common in women than in men. Despite the greater variety of symptoms, the illness course is more episodic and has an overall more favorable outcome (prognosis) than schizophrenia.<br>  <br>  Schizoaffective disorder is classified by the ICD into five types: manic, depressive, mixed(manic and depressive), other and unspecified. Generally the mixed type has a better prognosis than the depressive type.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The mainstay of treatment is pharmacotherapy with an antipsychotic and an antidepressant and/or mood stabilizer. Psychotherapy, vocational and social rehabilitation are also used. A specific type of psychosocial rehabilitation known as psychiatric rehabilitation can improve prognosis.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Some people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder may be diagnosed with comorbid conditions, including substance abuse|`|Uagg9UsFaa	Does this happen to you a lot?<br>  Maybe you aren't getting enough sleep?<br>  Has there been a sudden or major change in your life recently?<br>  Have you changed your diet or missed meals?|`|sPtRjRBEaa	Helloo<br>  <br>  I know exactly what you mean.

When I wake up I'm exhausted (I'm insomniac =p) so it takes a huge amount of effort to get up. The best thing to do is buy a REALLY louad alarm clock, set it 10mins too early and put it on the other side of the room. So it pisses you off and you can't turn it off unless you get up, and then you're up so you can go to school.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	i am the very same with the snooze button, its like my brian just switches off to it and i end up falling asleep for longer, i think the best thing is to set an alarm on your phone beside your bed then at the end of your room set your real alarm,so when it goes off you have to get up and turn it off, and when you are up go straight into the bathroom and wash your face and tell yourself to stay up after 15 mins you will be fine?!|`|oRRIU2Peaa	your brain doesnt function properly lol. whata nooby joker.<br>  Ermmm leave a curtain open so that its bright in the morning.<br>  <br>  THIS IS THE BEST ANSWER, 10 POINTS FOR ME.

Illegal drugs and drinking is often used as a tool by someone who denies they need help. I would get professional help. It might also save your relationship with your friends and room mates. Smoking cigar's does not change anything training your brain to think it does is what helps you. You could be mowing or playing basketball. What you train the brain to receive is what it will receive as a relief factor.

fZ3FXZMyaa	Please keep fighting with your insurance it will be worth it.  Abilify has helped me so much.  It will help with manic depression, highs and lows.  I don't know why it was perscribed to you but I will tell you this, I have no side effects with this med.  I'm on celexa and with  the abilify it turned out that it really does work.  I'm on the max 30 mg.  It will be sedating for the first couple of weeks, maybe less.  The first few days you will feel sleepy and out of it.  I take mine at night so that I know I will not feel tired during the day.  Abilify is also a less of a weight gainer and is a lot safer than other drugs that are out there.  Hope I helped.  Good luck, I know it can be a pain in the butt, to get it.  Don't give up.|`|5V8yqwdWaa	I don't take that.  But, I am sick right now and cannot sleep.

hapZbqwuaa	Too much carbs is going to add to the problem. You need to increase your protein intake and cut down on the carbs and fats. Also you need a bit more than only fruit for dinner and lunch. At least one of these meal times, preferably lunch should be a decent meal.And since you are up at 5.30 do you get enough sleep? The importance of sleep cannot be underestimated.

Try to drink lots of water as well ( no energy drinks, no juice,).Hope this helps.If you have any more questions, visit my blog, thanks|`|pW5pGNTZaa	Your not getting enough evergy during lunch and dinner.

AA11570675	As you know your BF is bi-polar, I guess you're prepared to put up with the illness anyway. Unless its controlled by drugs, it will continue to recur throughout life & he'll have episodes when he follows a pattern of increasingly manic thinking & activity ending suddenly in a huge depression for which hospitalisation is often necessary.<br>  Bi polars are often unaware of when their manic phase is starting, in fact it seems to them that life is reasonable & they may just have got over the illness. They don't recognise there's a problem. So the only thing you can do is to tell him. Problem is, as he seems to already be started in this phase he's at the time when he's least likely to recognise it & most likely to refuse treatment. In his view, he's doing great but everybody else has a problem, so why should he need to take meds?<br>  By all means tell him, but you're probably wasting your breath. But do you love him enough to see him through this episode and the depression that will follow? Its a lot to bear so I just hope & pray you have the strength to do it.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	End the relationship - you are not gaining anything from being with him and he sounds like he doesn't care about himself and doesn't care about you so the lying and lack of respect will continue unfortunately.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Don't doubt him till you have evidance.

People in trouble turn to the ones they are close to or love. If he is in that bad of a way do you really want the responsibility of it. As far as your guy friend spending the night with you.....not cool unless your boyfriend was there and approved. Then again if you hadn't spoke to him in 2 weeks does he care about you or not?  More importantly than that how do you really feel about this guy? Text messages are ok but in your case just a easy way out for him. Personally I would carry on with my own life and if I wanted to answer a text I would, if I didn't I wouldn't. Bi polar people do not forget about girlfriends for 2 weeks. Read about Bi polar people on the internet there are many sites to go on. Learn the traits and see if he is bi polar or using it as a tool. The commercials on TV are not all true. I have a Bi polar son. Believe me they do know right from wrong. They can have a healthy respectful relationship.

If you've never experienced this before, there could be a good possibility that this could be due to a possible prolapse of your uterus. If not, then it could be that you may have Endometriosis, which is another thing all together. If I were you, I would do some research and take any findings, questions or symptoms to the doctor. Best of luck. Here is a website to start you out on some research...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/female-pain-during-sex" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/g...</a>|`|yDJiiqcsaa	More women have a condition (from birth) called a retroflexed uterus than is commonly believed. Check out this site - it is the company that makes those drawing/charts for doctors offices that show the anatomy.  Check   <a href="http://catalog.nucleusinc.com" rel="nofollow">http://catalog.nucleusinc.com</a>   then find the illustration BJ00014 which shows a mid sagittal section view of a normal uterus postioning and then compare to BJ00051 for a retroflexed uterus. You will see that in the retroflexed position that penis cannot avoid "banging into" the body of the uterus and causing discomfort.  If that is the case then you will have no "cure" other than telling him, "Hey !! don't go in so deep, fool , it hurts !" Of course your OB/GYN will have to verify that diagnosis to be sure.

The fact that you have a strong family history of heart disease is what separates you from all the others who say it probably is nothing.  I would respect any message and get myself checked.  I have a very strong history as well, my grandfather died in his early fifties of a heart attack, my father suffers from heart disease, I have two siblings who have had heart attacks under the age of 40.

Unfortunately for women we do not get full proof warning signs when it comes to the heart.    I am not trying to send you in with an anxiety attack, issues like these need you to keep your cool, cause it is amazing how your body can start shooting off all kinds of false alarms.  So you can understand, when my second sibling had the heart attack and I found out I started having symptoms of a heart attack myself.

AA11020187	I hope you don’t need chemo as it is only used if the cancer is advanced and/or deep and not all that effective against melanoma. Right now there is no way of knowing. There is nothing else you can do. You called the doctor as soon as you noticed it and I don’t know how you got in so fast, so you did the best you could. Why didn’t he remove it while you were there? Melanoma doesn’t often occur in someone your age only 1% are under 20 year old. There is also the possibility that if it is cancer it could be a basal cell, which is far less dangerous than melanoma.|`|MyUi3Blyaa	It's a mole that is weird.<br>  You won't need chemo yet but you may need further tests, one step at a time.

l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  What are Moobs?|`|qcecsrDsaa	You need to diet and preform push-ups on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Body builders who have trained for a long time will develop  man-boobs when they stop working out. They (body builders) have to come down slowly on their exercises to let the skin and tissue reside to the former posistion and look.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qzRDh8Rgaa	Lose body fat.<br>  Exercise, cut out fatty fried food.<br>  Run/Jog, lose more weight.|`|B1WOmORUaa	Do push-ups.|`|rq9aLqTnaa	try to reduce fat and do some excercises meant for chest|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|lEXTHOZPaa	Next to a very prominent beer belly,man boobs are a cause for great concern to many men. Man boobs,excess weight and obesity are closely related. They are all of equal concern to many men. However, when man boobs start to "hang out", they become cause for even greater worry and anxiety. To be sure,you cannot get lose man boobs without some effort. What is required is a combination of a proper diet and right exercise.<br>  <br>  Before we attempt to lose our man boobs, we need to understand what causes them. The main cause of it is sluggish metabolism. Therefore,diet plays a key role in any attempt to lose man boobs. As we age,our metabolism rate slows down and the caloric burn rate is weaker. To continue guzzling beer,eating potato chips with gay abandon and spending hours on the sofa and at the same time wanting to lose your man boobs just does not jive

nQkH90n6aa	I can honestly out of all the circumcised men I know only 3 have shown no interest in restoration. Most of the others want to, and a few less have started doing it. I only know one who finished and his took 4 months which I thought was pretty quick but I suppose the younger you are the easier it is (plus he was VERY determined after he was sure he looked bigger after one stretching session, lol, men...)<br>  <br>  I've never heard of a son sueing their parents before, but then, that's hardly going to make headlines when doctors are making $300-$600 per foreskin, is it? I  think it's amazing that more parents aren't stopping to think "Hmmm..Why does nobody die from having a foreskin since it's so unclean/ugly/it will eat you if you don't have it removed?"<br>  <br>  However, I did read about a dad who circumcised his children on his kitchen table with a knife, he got arrested, he didn't trust doctors. And one where parents were sueing a doctor because their son needed penis reconstruction, can you imagine that going wrong with no pain relief? How could you NOT be mad at yourself for that happening? <br>  <br>  Another one I found myself banging my head against a wall for, a lady with a 9m.o. who is immunocompromised with heart problems, she didn't want him to get a deadly foreskin infection. I'd be more worried about a deadly heart rate during the procedure AND deadly post op infections. I only read why she wanted to do it, not how it went, so I have no idea what happened to that little guy.<br>  <br>  And from the amount of restoration help websites, blogs, and stretch aids being sold, I think it's a massive underground thing that people just don't talk about - yet.|`|AA11570675	It would be difficult to tell as foreskin reconstruction isn't really a surgical procedure. It takes about a year to 18 months of stretching the skin back over the crown but it's nearly always done as a DIY job. This usually produces a loose but comfortable cover which works just like the original. The only real differences are that the frenulum remains cut, but nobody seems to have a problem with that, & of course the skin can be very loose. It's possible to have the newly regrown skin surgically tightened, but few people bother.<br>  Therefore as it's rarely done surgically it is impossible to tell how common reconstruction really is.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	Reconstructive foreskin surgery is not quite 'there' yet.  I have seen some photos of surgical foreskin restoration and when compared to manual restoration, the results are not as good, appearance wise.<br>  I know the procedure is still in developmental stages. If you go to www.norm.org, you can read articles on surgical restoration, but even that site makes note that the most satisfactory results will be achieved by manual stretching with a device.  The whole process of manual foreskin restoration can takes years.  Reading below, that one person took four months is not reliable information.  I am now at my two year point restoring my foreskin using stretching devices, both purchased, and homemade, and I know I still have two years to go.  Even the most basic restoration will take between 1-3 years.  There is no fast-tracking it.  It just takes time.  In both cases, it will provide coverage and protection of the sensitive glans in your clothing, and gives a certain satisfaction to be 'normal' again.  In neither case will it ever be as good as the original, nerve enervated foreskin that was torn off our screeming bodies years ago.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't know but definitely increasing, I see questions on here about it often and loads of guys are curious about what they are missing and a fair few of them try restoration.<br>  <br>  I think lawsuits are harder but there have been some cases, I don't think suing parents though, but suing hositals for fraud (invalid consent). I'm sure there will be more lawsuits in the future though when people realise more about it.<br>  <br>  Harriet

Also, drink a full glass of water with it to help it dissolve quicker & you can cut them in half to make them easier to swallow.

So unless he's willing to try you on something like hydrocodone and you discover that you're okay with that one (it could very well make you feel just as nasty, if not worse), you may just have to decide whether the pain relief is worth the sick feeling it gives you.

ccLh1KSGaa	I was on meds two times for the same reason. The side effects may vary, depending on whether your body is used to drugs/meds. 20mg is not that much, and if you work towards an ultimate intake, you might not notice too much.<br>  <br>  The first time was very intense for me, since I was in bed with severe anxiety attacks for about 4 weeks straight, prior to getting the meds prescribed. I was 'ordered' to start taking 200mg of Seroxat straight away.<br>  I was completely out of it, saw things that weren't there, threw up everything, my hands were even green at some point (or at least I thought they were). The only thing that I did was read, to keep my mind focused on something fun. And after about a week, just like that, the side effects were gone.<br>  <br>  The second time I took 20mg (like you). I remember being a bit woozy in the beginning. My appetite was completely gone and I felt a bit zombie-ish, like when you're a bit stoned (not completely high as a kite or anything). It was nothing compared to the first time I was on anti depressants, and it worked pretty well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about 20mg. And if you are anxious: don't read the side effects part of the instructions. Once they start doing their job, you will sometimes even forget to take them, since you are feeling so normal.<br>  <br>  Anti depressants can be a great help, and I know it can be very scary (especially when you are taking them for panic attacks in the first place) but for me it was totally worth it.<br>  <br>  I am now 26 and completely meds-free and even though I sometimes still get a little scare here and there (big crowds, you know the drill), I can finally say that I don't think about it too much anymore.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

It can be very difficult to run away with the feeling that you will be caught and probably be beaten to death. Most victims are powerless, have little financial Independence if any and don't know of a place that they would be safe from their abuser. Some were abused as children, or saw a parent being abused and genuinely believe that this happens in every household. Some see it as an expression of love. It is  a much more complex situation than you appear to understand.|`|1yGDFTieaa	They're scared - it is as simple as that.<br>  They know their boyfriend/husband will attack them when they do "minor" things, maybe speaking 'out of line', making a joke that he takes as an insult, etc. They know full well that if they leave the house and attempt to make a new life, their boyfriend/husband is likely to try and find them, then assault them again. <br>  <br>  Some also love their boyfriend/husband so much that they believe every time he says "sorry, I won't do it again", they believe him & do strongly believe in their heart that it won't happen again. <br>  <br>  Also, domestic violence isn't really talked about, not where I live anyway. Some women feel as if they have no support, no one to turn to, no where to go, etc, which basically leaves them with no choice but to stay with the person who abuses them. <br>  <br>  You sound like you're from a supportive and rather privileged family, not everyone is. Some people's parents don't give a crap what happens to their child(ren) the amount of confidence that kicks out of a person is unbelievable.|`|rQfzifT7aa	It seems stupid to a person on the outside looking in but to the one in the inside, it is very complicated. <br>  <br>  I was in an abusive relationship for almost 10 years. Thankfully it was only verbal abuse and I was never hit. Sadly my child was.<br>  <br>  I stayed because one I didn't realize how damaging his words were and just how much he was abusing my child. <br>  <br>  I also stayed because we had a child together. I didn't want him to be without both a mother and a father. Yet my oldest child was treated badly. We were not physically abused by no means, but verbal abuse is very painful and hurtful as well. <br>  <br>  I stayed because I would not be able to financially take care of me and my kids without his income.<br>  <br>  I stayed because I didn't want to give up on my marriage, I wanted it to work and I wanted him to change and be a good husband and father. <br>  <br>  Women stay in really abusive relationships for the same reasons as I did and they also stay because they are afraid of  there abusers.<br>  The abuser swears he will never do anything like that again and they love you and they really lay it on thick and for a while things are better, then something comes along that sets him off in a rage again and it starts all over again.<br>  <br>  Just with the verbal abuse, me and my oldest son went through 2 years of counciling to be able to cope. We both were having panic attacks and were on depression meds. It really worked on us. We overcame it and are doing really good now 4 years later.|`|Px8urrAuaa	A lot of women just don't get it.<br>  Some may think their family will frown upon it.<br>  Some may be LITERALLY AFRAID to leave, because he could come after them. Love is blind...<br>  <br>  Some women just refuse to realize that love shouldn't physically hurt. I wish I could just give every abused woman a hug, and let them know that life can be better. Mental abuse is just as bad, never let someone tell you that you're worthless.<br>  <br>  Have a great day.<br>  x
AA11678263	Unfortunately there's not really anything you can do about it.  My hips and knees crack when I am still for a moment and then move.  I always think I'd be a rubbish burglar because they could identify me by the noise!  My boyfriend used to wince when he heard it because he thought it hurt me, but once he realised it's just a noise, he forgot about it.  It's not gross, so don't be down on yourself.

Look for "mild" brands with "24 hour" effect, this should mean they don't irritate your sweat glands into producing more later and should last they day (although doubtfully 24 hours, keep it with you).<br>  <br>  Make sure you shower each morning too, apply the antiperspirant about 15 mins after showering.|`|9iEhlRgUaa	My sister is like that. She stinks the room out all the time. Shower EVERY day and wash under yourarmpits with a strong smelling soap.

9wJaUSNWaa	Start by focusing and ruling out - basically calm down and assess your priority and needs.<br>  <br>  Your hormones are way out-of-sink. You are now solely responsible for the baby - that in itself is a lot of pressure.<br>  <br>  1) you are old enough to have partner and baby - your apron strings toward your father should not be so tight as to fall apart with this news.  Let yourself acknowledge the news and also that whom ever you know as your dad has been just that - however good or bad that life experience has been thus far.  If you have a different biological father -  Don't take it as bad news - you may have someone else whom loves you!  Be forgiving and understanding - after all, you now are a parent and a partner.  We all make mistakes or corrective changes in our paths.<br>  2) Your feelings of apathy or over whelming highs and lows are from your hormones.  We take things out on those closest to us.  Remember that your partner is going through the new baby and a hormonal partner as well.  Try talking with your partner - ask him how he feels and explain your feelings too - but not in heat of passion or rage.  A good listener should not accuse or judge but try to understand.  Ask him to help you over come these feelings of helplessness.<br>  3) if your partner is thinking of an affair; there really is only two things available: A) make him want to stay true, B) dump and go on.... it may be that someone is texting over his personal issues with being a new dad and problems with post-pardum blues in you.  There can be any number of logical reasons a woman would be texting your partner.   For sure, talking and keeping in contact with each other is best.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about your emotional state.  Try taking some vitamins - B complex or b-12 is good.  Drink lots of water to flush your system.<br>  <br>  Remember why you had a baby and how you wanted to hold him and love him.<br>  <br>  Remember you and your partner had a connection prior to the baby - focus on those attributes and previous discussions.<br>  <br>  Find a reliable baby sitter for some much needed rest and fun.  Some times with the partner and sometimes just for yourself.<br>  <br>  New babies are wonderful and yet can push you to your limits.  It's OK to have these feelings.  Your body has to adjust and it takes time - but a doctor's prescription or recommended vitamins, exercise and lots of water will help get you through it.<br>  <br>  Did you take Lamaze classes?  If so, you probably talked of these and other issues... if not, it is very common and there are more things to know.  Try looking up online or library on issues for new mothers and fathers.  Dad's can feel very over whelmed - some feel they must work even more; other feel they are set aside and unimportant, some want to fly away... all normal responses...<br>  <br>  Find time to laugh and enjoy yourself, each other and the new baby.  Time goes by so fast.  <br>  <br>  What would you tell your baby if his dad were replaced ? <br>  <br>  Good luck with your new life.  Do seek a doctor and rest up.  For many of us have been exactly where you are.  It gets better, especially if you and your partner communicate and work together on life's problems.|`|8ztWRIHMaa	ok you should go and seek counselling on, you can get recommendation from your GP ok, and you should not go through your boyfriend phone and what ever the problem the baby have nothing to do with it ok.... and your probably just feeling lonely are need someone to confine to... go find a activity<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|niGAKJT4aa	postpartum depression sweetie, go see a doctor, they'll get you help.  or maybe a p/p chat group.|`|nAX8Hfcuaa	can you rephrase in english please?|`|OyBuEpOTaa	77 gave you a very good answer. even though you had some bad news, you shouldn't feel this bad about it.

The dentist may also want to do an xray and maybe exam if you have not had one in the past year. I would encourage you to visit the great website: www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago and they have saved me thousands on all services.

You really need it seen to as you could have some underlying infection if it's a nasty injury and you might need antibiotics. Don't worry about going to A&E I know the staff always ask what happened but they do deal with self harm on a regular basis and are not there to lecture you although of course they will advise some other help with the problem if you're not having it already. I have had experience of self harm as my daughter did it for some time although thank goodness she has come through the other end after having help, the Doctors were always very kind and considerate to her throughout. So don't hesitate go and have your arm sorted because it'll only get worse and in the long run it'll cause you more worry and stress.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Eat more! Don't be fooled because the article is referring to more of healthy, low-fat foods rather than junk food. Junk food can range from burgers to those cookies that you always bought! Adding a lot of vegetables and fruits to your diet will help you. Also, drinking bouillon, a Haitian soup, made with filtered water will help you feel full. <br>   <br>  BasketballExercise every day! This could be the most difficult step to follow. But what you can do is actually start slowly then steady increase the amount of exercise. For example, today you will walk for 10 minutes, repeat this for the whole week. For the next week, double your workload. You may get leaner that way! The important thing is to get your heart rate up and start, now! <br>  Feed your temptations once in a while. Go ahead and have that donut or slice of pizza, but before you do, drink a few glasses of water and eat a bowl of raw veggies such as cucumbers, celery, carrots, and tomatoes. They will fill you up and you will have very little room to eat the "junk" food. <br>   <br>  Scrumptious!Consume things that have no calories. There are two things you eat and drink that contain no calories: water and fiber. The more of these you get into your diet, the better off you will be. For example, you can eat a pound of mixed salad greens with assorted raw vegetables (carrots, red cabbage, celery, broccoli, onion, etc.) with a low or no-calorie salad dressing and only have eaten 100-150 calories. This is because of the high water and fiber content of the salad and low calorie dressing. Also, eat lots of celery. It has only 8 calories, but amazingly, it takes more than 8 calories to digest it. So, you actually BURN calories by eating celery! It's not much, about 2 calories per 8 inch stalk, but it sure doesn't hurt. <br>  Avoid sodas as much as possible. Instead, drink flavored water or unsweetened iced tea. <br>  Take broth-based soups. They are a relatively low in calories. A commerically-available ready to eat "chicken and stars" soup may only have 80 calories for 1 serving, much less than diet "meal shakes" or nutrition bars. <br>   <br>  These may help you.Practice good eating habits. Always use utensils and sit at the table. This stops you from eating precariously. Eating with your hands will mean that you take in more food in one scoop. Don't forget to eat slowly and stop when you're full. Similar to the above step, if you can't stop, drink up! Maybe your body is thirsty and hungry no more! Also, you can do any other chores (other than eating). For instance, go shopping, or play badminton with your friend, or play games on the computer! <br>  Spread out your diet! Eat more small chunks of meals, rather than 3 big meals. If you eat 100-150 calories or so every two hours, your body stays in a higher-metabolism digesting mode. This allows you to burn more calories than eating just 3 meals a day.[1] <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://centerformedicalweightloss.com/la..." rel="nofollow">http://centerformedicalweightloss.com/la...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.smallstep.gov/?gclid=CIqXsZjb..." rel="nofollow">http://www.smallstep.gov/?gclid=CIqXsZjb...</a><br>  <a href="http://exercise.about.com/cs/weightloss/..." rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/cs/weightloss/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/200..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice..." rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice...</a>|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You are eating too little. you should eat not less than 1200 calories a day.<br>  Eating Less will make you sick and also slowdown your Metabolism.<br>  Take care and do things the right way|`|AvJc1l3xaa	Maybe you can try going to the gym 3 times a week, thats what I used to do.

F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggested by baba Ramdev in Aastha channel for 10 minutes|`|X9QOHRLFaa	Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. I know that what you have been trying to do for quite some time, to no results. I was doing the same , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. You need a structured plan / a weight loss solution that is customized according to your body. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.
