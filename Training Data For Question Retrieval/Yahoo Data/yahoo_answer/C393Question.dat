20090219211234AAf851k	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Please help me! What is this thing??? 10 points to the first person who knows what it is!!!?	Greetings! I bought this about 5 years ago at an auction - not sure why... Anyway, at first it appeared to be some sort of cradle but upon further ispection it seems to be a type of scoop. The basketry is quite lovely and tightly woven so it is very strong. Along the front edge is a metal plate which is fastened in place with very rustic looking metal (iron?) fasteners. The handle is made of solid wood fastened quite securely with more basketry weave.       Does anyone know    1. exactly what this is?   2. where it would have been made?   3. for what purpose?   4. how old it may be?   5. is it of any anique or other value?   6 anything else about it?      Note: Opinions are appreciated as well but I am really looking for a definitive answer. Thank you so much in advance!!!

20080320010711AAaj0IB	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	What is the best process to dry clothes at the laundromat (the optimization of speed and cost)?	The two extremes are placing very few clothes in many dryers and packing a few dryers with many clothes.  Still there are a number of other factors that I imagine are important, such as:     -  the amount of time per quarter    -  whether or not you need to "toss" the clothes to get the wet clothes in the middle towards the outside    -  whether stopping the dryer after each quarter significantly reduces the amount of heat and consequently the drying time    -  other factors that I haven't thought of.       Can someone comment on what method is theoretically fastest, THEN what process is theoretically cheapest, THEN what is the optimization of fast and cheap (if they are not the same)
20070616194123AA5qAfp	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Decorating Resources?	Does anyone have any resources for furniture suppliers?    I'm looking for something rather specific and would also like the price to be right, a difficult combination.      I'm looking for classic, almost victorian-style furniture, perhaps art deco as well. I would also prefer lighter furniture since we move constantly. Maybe English campaign-style. The other constraint is price, the less expensive the better. Real wood is also a huge plus. I know its insane but I find that most furniture manufacturers make things just too heavy and big to be moving around!

20081003121747AAT0eaF	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	How do you get rid of skunks?	ok, now I know people will be tempted to say things that I have already thought of, like fix holes in the fence, make sure no garbage or animal food is around, etc.  But the fact is, right now I do have holes in my fence, and I do feed the birds, but we have city-issued garbage cans that animals can't get into, so I need a solution other than taking care of those things.      My neighbor has a family of these damn things living under their porch, and we have a field across the street with plenty of rodents, and two restaurants nearby with plenty of garbage, so unfortunately I know these critters are here to stay.  What I need is some kind of natural repellent that isn't harmful to my dogs or cats.  I put out mothballs before I realized how toxic they are (I cleaned them up), and I really want something else.  I've heard that cedar chips might work.  Does anyone know if this is true, or if there is anything else out there?
