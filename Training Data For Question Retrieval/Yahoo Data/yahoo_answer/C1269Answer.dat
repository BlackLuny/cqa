vnNOQ3a8aa	chemical engineering is a great degree if you are looking to utilize higher level chemistry and physics to solve practical problems. I am a chemical engineering student at Texas Tech, and I really do enjoy it alot. It's hard work, but the degree is very prestigious, and students graduating with a bachelors degree can easily find jobs that start out at 80,000 a year. Chemical engineering courses typically involve the most advance thermodynamics courses available, as well as heat transfer and experimentation labs, mass transport labs, ect. One thing I like about being in my chem E is that the college itself is very small, theres only about 40 people in my engineering classes right now, and a handful drop after every semester. So you really become close to the people in your classes, and since alot of the same professors teach the engineering courses, they get to know you by name (and if your a good student this is a good thing). I would recommend Chemical engineering to you (possibly because im in it myself) however, keep in mind that alot of mathematics is requires as well. Ofcourse, if your interested in a degree that utilizes physics, I wouldn't image that you'd be trying to steer clear from math. Mathematics courses required are calculus I,II,and III, and differential equations. After those required courses you only need two more maths to minor in the subject. Long story short, if you would like a fulfilling career when you get out of college where you could go work in alternative fuels, polymers, synthetics, nuclear reactors, and virtually any plant management position you can think of, chemical engineering is right for you.|`|OQXXN9phaa	I'd say chemical engineer may be up your alley.<br>  <br>  Edit:Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with the application of physical science (e.g. chemistry and physics), with mathematics, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms. In addition to producing useful materials, modern chemical engineering is also concerned with pioneering valuable new materials and techniques - such as nanotechnology, fuel cells and biomedical engineering.[1] A person employed in this field is called a chemical engineer.|`|m8tm3enpaa	yep, chem engineering

c9bb0800f328dabfab36ce12128a0f27aa	I can think of three situation that this can occur.<br>  <br>  1. The tornado may not had a chance yet to pick up enough dirt, debris, or other loose object to make the spinning column of air more visible.  A tornado is basically wind spinning quickly in a tight closed circular motion.  Unless something get caught up in this spinning air or gets carried or entrained by this wind, this spinning funnel of air can be very hard to see.<br>  <br>  2.  The funnel may be still in its developing stage and touches down right in front of the state trooper.   Or the tornado had just lifted off the ground briefly a short distance away and then it drops back down to the ground again in front of the trooper.  It is not uncommon to find tornado storm tracks that suddenly end and reappear a short distance away as the tornado "skips" along the ground.  Sometimes it is a good idea to look up to see what directly above you that may come down at you or next to you.  Looking up my not be possible if you are in a vehicle like inside of that patrol car.<br>  <br>  3.  The core of the precipitation is blocking your view.  A tornado often forms very close to the area where you will get the most intense precipitation (very heavy rain and/or large hail).  That is the reason why storm chasers should not try to drive through the core of the heavy precipitation or what is known as "core punching".  You will be blinded by the heavy precipitation and you will not be able to see what may be waiting on the other side of the precipitation core.  Besides that, there is a good chance of very large hail falling inside of that precipitation core.  So it is possible that the tornado view was blocked by the precipitation until it reach near where that trooper was located.<br>  <br>  Well, that my 3 cents worth...|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	It is possible.  Not all tornadoes have a visible funnel all the way to the surface.  This is particularly true in drier areas of the country, where many times the only evidence that the tornado is on the ground is by the dust and/or debris swirling close to the ground.|`|AsKWImpQaa	I didn't see this, but what they might mean is that the condensation funnel (the cloud like part) of a tornado might not reach all the way to the ground, but the strong winds do nonetheless. Still, the strong winds will stir up dust and debris anywhere they occur (except perhaps over concrete), so you should be able to see the circulation that way.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you shouldn't think that you're safe just because you're not in the cloud-like part of the tornado, you need to stay well clear of it.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Not all tornadoes are touching down, so they may not have a lot of debris to make them visible.<br>  <br>  But have you ever seen an invisible tornado?<br>  <br>  All tornadoes are powered by condensation, that is where their energy comes from, so somewhere above there will be clouds, and if there is a spout formed, you can see it, but not necessarily at ground level.|`|UzJRCEEFaa	the official term of a tornado covered with rain is a 'rain-wrapped tornado' it is an official deffinition by the SKYWARN Severe Weather spotter's classes<br>  <br>  They train you on all that stuff how a tornado can be hidden, this is just an add on to the guy before me who defined all the things a tornado can hide in, I think he deserves best answer, cause I would give all those other deffinitions as well|`|t64wxdcJaa	it has to do with the amount of water droplets it has. when it has alot, it becomes visible

AA11518691	I DO BELEIVE THAST AVOGRADO'S NUMBER WHICH IS USED TO COVERT NAMES AFTER SCIENTIST AVOGADRO|`|vSkqJ813aa	Wikipedia comments that,'... 'The Avogadro constant is named after the early nineteenth century Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, who, in 1811, first proposed that the volume of a gas (at a given pressure and temperature) is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of the nature of the gas. The French physicist Jean Perrin in 1909 proposed naming the constant in honour of Avogadro. Perrin would win the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, in a large part for his work in determining the Avogadro constant by several different methods.<br>  <br>  The value of the Avogadro constant was first indicated by Johann Josef Loschmidt who, in 1865, estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas. This latter value, the number density of particles in an ideal gas, is now called the Loschmidt constant in his honour, and is approximately proportional to the Avogadro constant. The connection with Loschmidt is the root of the symbol L sometimes used for the Avogadro constant, and German language literature may refer to both constants by the same name, distinguished only by the units of measurement. ...'<br>  <br>  <br>  In 1905, Albert Einstein used statistical methods to make an estimate of Avogadro's number. He submitted this estimate as his PhD thesis. Wikipedia adds, '... At the age of 26, having studied under Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. His dissertation was entitled A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions. ...'. Apparently Einstein found an inital value of about 3 x 1023 for the constant but he refined his calculation to a more modern value over the next few years!|`|E1gN87H0aa	It's known as the "Avagadro" number.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Wilhelm Ostwald<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  damn it, yes below is correct!

Ftkr9jqYaa	Cytotoxicity is just one of innumerable phenomena encompassed by gene expression.  Cytotoxicity is the quality of being toxic to cells.  Cytotoxicity can be caused by many poisonous chemicals, such as spider venoms.  Cytotoxicity can also be biologically mediated, causing cellular apoptosis or necrosis.  Such genetically mediated cytotoxicity frequently occurs in cancerous tumors.<br>  <br>  Gene expression is the transcription, translation, and phenotypic manifestation of a gene.  The gene can be translated into either a protein or RNA. Expressed genes include genes that are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into protein, as well as genes that are transcribed into other types of RNA such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that are not translated into protein. Gene expression is a highly specific process in which a gene is switched on at a certain time and "speaks out."<br>  <br>  Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated, including the transcription step, the translation step, and the post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and is the basis for cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the functions (actions) of the gene in the organism. Non-protein coding genes (e.g. rRNA genes, tRNA genes) are transcribed, but not translated into protein.<br>  <br>  A genetic expression system consists, minimally, of a source of DNA and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the nutrients and fuel provided. In the broadest sense, this includes every living cell capable of producing protein from DNA. However, an expression system more specifically refers to a laboratory tool, often artificial in some manner, used for assembling the product of a specific gene or genes. It is defined as the "combination of an expression vector, its cloned DNA, and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell, that is, produce proteins at a high level."<br>  <br>  In addition to these biological tools, certain naturally observed configurations of DNA (genes, promoters, enhancers, repressors) and the associated machinery itself are referred to as an expression system, as in the simple repressor 'switch' expression system in Lambda phage. It is these natural expression systems that inspire artificial expression systems, (such as the Tet-on and Tet-off expression systems).<br>  <br>  Each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities, and may be named after the host, the DNA source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material.<br>  <br>  One example of biologically mediated cytotoxicity is Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is the cell-killing ability of certain lymphocytes, and requires the marking of the target cell by an antibody. Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which is mediated by the complement system.  Three groups of cytotoxic lymphocytes are distinguished:  (1) Cytotoxic T cells, (2) Natural Killer cells, and (3) Natural Killer T cells.

They are kinda hard to distinguish the effects between the two for the unitiated.  I feel like mushrooms provide a more spiritual outlook, while LSD provides more of a tool to deal with mental issues.  But that is just my personal interpretation, and you may feel totally different.  And dont let anyone give you any of that natural crap, it really doesnt fly.  LSD is a beautiful chemical, but psilocybin is also a beautiful chemical.  Both are chemicals.|`|CMUMhXaiaa	Most of the people answering this question haven't done both, or probably either, so let me tell you what really goes down. Shrooms are definitely more of a strong body buzz, and are barely hallucinogenic. It's just an ordinary trip, but it's definitely nice. LSD is much more of a hardcore trip. It is very, very nice. You will experience hallucinations, but nothing like you would expect. You don't see rainbows and unicorns and stuff. But every trip is different, and trips also vary from person to person. I would rather have acid any day over shrooms.|`|njrd7kCLaa	I'd strongly recommend shrooms first, as they last 3-6 hours. LSD tends to last 10-12 hours, which is great if the trip's going well, but if it gets too much, you're in trouble. <br>  Some of the best nights of my life have been on these drugs, but also some of the worst. The only shrooms I've taken are Liberty Caps- I don't know about any others- google it before you take. <br>  Don't take it lightly- be somewhere comfortable with people you like and know well. Don't take if you've something particularly bad going on in your life- it could make you focus on it. (for hours)  And always remember you're not going mad, and things WILL return to normal. And don't overdo it 1st time.<br>  Other than the length of trip, I'm not sure there's much difference between the effects. As someone else said though, you probably won't see rainbows/unicorns- just a distorted vision that (occasionally) is chaotic enough to make you interpret what you see wrongly. Sometimes, if you've had enough (of either), you can see the air- small colourful metallic particles in space. Moments like that are just magical. <br>  In summary, enjoy, but be careful.|`|bjE5S8oFaa	shrooms are best for first time user.<br>  LSD can be dangerous cuz if you get the mix wrong or its a bad mix from the dealer you can get really bad trips (as in nightmares and hallucinations) for years afterwards.<br>  as long as there the right type of shrooms you shud have happy trips =P<br>  for eg. a guy in england took too much of an LSD drug and thought there was insects inside his head and stabbed a screwdriver into his eye to get it out =(.<br>  if your unsure try weed first as its the safest of most drugs.<br>  em experience is hard to explain, maybe somebody else can clarify it.|`|37ihgSAnaa	I would suggest you don't do either. <br>  but if you were to try one do shrooms I heard its mostly a body high.

qmL9yfOkaa	Genetic drift is one of the ways in genetic change happens in a population over time.<br>  <br>  First, all genetic variation comes from mutations in the genetic code, and these mutations can because by a number of things that interrupt the copying process during cell division - radiation, toxic chemicals, viruses, etc... Sometimes those copy errors can happen without a trigger. If those mutations happen in a germ-line cell, they can be passed on to the next generation.<br>  <br>  Now the mutation causes some change in the physical form of the animal that gives the animal an advantage or disadvantage in reproducing and getting it's genes into the next generation then natural selection comes in to play. The more advantageous a mutation is the faster it spreads through the population.<br>  <br>  But what if the mutation confers absolutely no advantage or disadvantage whatsoever? Then you have genetic drift.<br>  <br>  Let's imagine an animal that has a protein with the DNA fragment <br>  ATG-CAA-AAA-CCG-GGG-TGG-TGA where ATG is the start codon and TGA is teh stop codon that identifies our hypothetical gene. A copy error could happen that turns the second to last codon, a TGG into a TGA a new stop codon. Now, whetever protein this gene was producing has been altered and it will perform better or worse than the original protein o natural selection will kick in.<br>  <br>  But what if the mutation instead turn the -AAA- into -AAG-? Well, both AAA and AAG code for the amino acid Lysine so in spite of the mutation the protein is unchanged and our hypothetical animal is no different from a non-mutant.<br>  <br>  If the animal doesn't get squashed by a falling tree before reproducing, and it's offspring avoid the same fate, that mutation will very slowly spread through out the population. But it will be like a leaf floating on the surface of a pond on a calm day - it will be drifting because natural selection cannot affect this mutation.<br>  <br>  More extensive changes can also happen in the non-coding regions of the DNA. As long as the mutation does not make a start codon, anything can happen because it will have no effect and they, too, will drift through the population.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	"Genetic drift" refers to random changes in allele frequency within a population. At one time that frequency of T in a population may be 60%, then 10 generations later, it may be 58%, then it may go back to 60%.  Drift occurs for no discernable reason.|`|9NwcErkiaa	Genetic drift or allelic drift is the change in the relative frequency of a gene variant (allele) in a population that results from the fact that alleles in offspring are a random sample of those in the parents, and because of the role of chance in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely, and thereby reduce genetic variability.<br>  <br>  In evolution, genetic drift is one of several processes that change allele frequencies over time. In contrast to natural selection, which makes gene variants more or less common due to their causal effects on reproductive success,[1] the changes due to genetic drift have no specific environmental cause, and may be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to reproductive success.<br>  <br>  The effect of genetic drift is larger in small populations, and smaller in large populations. The extent of the effect relative to the other three processes is a subject of debate, for example in the context of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Scientific views on the effect in large populations vary from insignificant to dominant.<br>  <br>  for more, view: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_dri...</a>

Mitochondria are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.

Then our equations become:<br>  F + T = 12<br>  5F + 10T = 80<br>  <br>  Just like before, multiplying the first equation by -5 and adding it to the second gives: -5T = -20, so T=4, which means F=12-4 = 8.  So that's another solution, "8 ones, 8 fives, and 4 tens."<br>  <br>  Are there any other solutions?  Notice that the next possible number of ones is 5+5+3 = 13.  This gives us<br>  F + T = 7<br>  5F + 10T = 75<br>  Solving this gives you T=8 and F= -1.  Obviously you can't have -1 fives, so there's no solution here.<br>  <br>  After that, you have to have at least 18 ones.  But that means having only two other bills, and if they're both tens that still only adds up to $38, which is much less than $88.  Higher numbers of ones (23, 28, etc.) would mean having more than 20 bills.|`|p43YceDoaa	x is amount of $1 bill<br>  y is amount of $5 bill<br>  m is amount of $10 bill<br>  x+y+m=20<br>  x+5y+10m=88<br>  subtract<br>  4y+9m=68<br>  y=(68-9m)/4<br>  x=(12+5m)/4<br>  solution set is ((12+5m)/4,(68-9m)/4,m)<br>  to make this true, m must be 4<br>  answer 8 $1 bill,8 $5 bill, 4 $10 bill|`|mpCDEoriaa	8- 1s  = 8<br>  8- 5s  = 40<br>  4- 10s= 40<br>  -----------------<br>  20      = 88
54bidlgDaa	I am also familiar with the stirling engine and I currently have four of them. I am also machining a fifth that will be added to my collection. <br>  <br>  My favorite engine is the stirling simply because it seems like such underused technology. They can run on nearly any fuel that produces enough heat and are very efficient at converting the heat energy from the burning fuel into energy. This is so because the most useful byproduct of combustion is heat. When gasoline is burned in a car, most of the energy from the fuel is wasted in the form of heat that escapes from the engine's exhaust. In the future I want to design and machine my own stirling engine so that I can put it in a model boat or car. Of all the precision engine models that you could make, the stirling engine is the easiest design because it has so few moving parts. <br>  <br>  If you want to collect small engine models, heat engines are the ones that are easiest to develop a collection with. The next model I am going to get is called a vacuum engine. It is also a heat engine, yet it operates on a different concept than the stirling cycle. You can see a picture of it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ministeam.com/acatalog/info_PMSolar_3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ministeam.com/acatalog/info_P...</a><br>  <br>  I think that my favorite engines will be the ones that I make myself; especially if I design it also.|`|Jn09Cruqaa	I agree, women are the best engine...

Furthermore, they operate efficiently at low temperatures and can be cooled by evaporation from the skin.  They use a fuel that has the following properties:  it has the same energy density as gasoline, it is everywhere, and people will pay a fortune to get rid of it.  What is that fuel?  Body fat.  And muscles are extremely good at using this fuel.<br>  <br>  Couple the muscles to a bicycle through a skeleton, and you have the most energy-efficient form of transportation ever invented.  The vehicle has far less mass than the passenger.  Put the passenger on a recumbent bicycle, and he has very low friction.  <br>  <br>  That's my idea of a great engine.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Personally my favorite engine is a woman.

But if it pass through these barier it need to fight with immune system. So how is this system fight with a virus then it will use something called white blood cell and plasma cell. But this white blood cells will not immediatly kill the virus because it might kill red blood cells instead of virus. It's like sniper there need to have a person who shoot and a person who need to lock the target. So what lock a target for white blood cell and it was b cell. B cell will find antigen which matches it recptor. Then it will help T cell. Then B cell will divide and produce plasma, and memory cell. Plasma cell will find a bacteria and send a out a cell that will lock a target and white blood cell "eater" will kill it and memory cell it will remeber that virus and if that virus attack you next time it will immediatly capture that virus before it goign to attack further.|`|8LfW9tBxaa	google my frienddd.|`|zLOCPungaa	Most of our immune system cells responsible for our defense are called white blood cells, they help to destroy infected cells and coordinate the overall response.

Our body produces different types of antibodies for different intruders, an antigen is a substance that prompts the generation of antibodies.

Here's why: the mother produced the egg which always carries just one X sex chromosome for being female, the default state.  However, the father produces two type of sperm cells, one type carrying an X chromosome and the second type carrying a Y chromosome.<br>  <br>  When a X carrying sperm cell fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote is XX or female.<br>  <br>  When a Y carrying sperm cell fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote is XY or male.<br>  <br>  So, if the offspring is male and hemophilic, the father can only contribute a Y chromosome to match with the mother's X chromosome already in the egg cell. Thus, the mother passes on the defective gene for hemophilia to her son vise her X chromosome.<br>  <br>  Biology: The Science of Life<br>  course 1500, on sale $179.95<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=1500" rel="nofollow">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLo...</a>|`|oWVUiDEMaa	yes|`|uLlwcUbsaa	Yes it can be hereditary.

9Wi2eNInaa	There is a beautiful interactive formula in Hyperphysics where you can see the formula along with pictures of the trajectories to understand this projectile problem . <br>  See this link and scroll down to the box titles "Will it clear this fence"?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/traj.html#tra3" rel="nofollow">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hba...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'll tell you the values I plugged in to equate it to your problem:<br>  <br>  -- Vo = 20 m/s<br>  <br>  -- Theta angle = 10 degrees. (You have to use 10 deg instead of 80 deg because your problem states it was hit at angle of 80 deg WITH RESPECT TO THE VERTICAL. Most theta angles in trajectories are measured with respect to horizontal)<br>  <br>  -- horizontal range = 10 meters<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  After you plug in your three values it will give you a calculated height is<br>  y = .50018 meters.<br>  <br>  Since the racket was at .60 meters y height to start with you add .60 meters+ .500 meters = <br>  <br>  =1.1 meters high where ball strikes wall <br>  <br>  The trajectory is downward and you can prove it by going to the box above "Will it clear the fence ?" box, that is titled "Calculation of Peak Height, Range and time of Flight" . It is interactive also and if you plug in 20 m/s for Vo, and theta = 10 deg . <br>  <br>  The calculator will automatically come up with a range of 13.96 meters. About half of that range is 7 meters where the apogee is reached. Since the wall in the problem is at 10 meters that means the ball will start dropping at 7 meters distance for the next 3 meters|`|4Vz9SuKGaa	The horizontal component of velocity Vh=V cos A=20 cos 20<br>  Vh=20 x 0.94 =18.8 m/s,this is free from g. Thus the time(t) taken by ball to travel 10 m distance will be:-<br>  t= s/v=10/18.8= 0.53 sec<br>  Now the height gained by the ball in 0.53 sec under the Verticale component of velocity[Vsin A](governed by g ) will be:-<br>  s=ut-1/2 gt^2<br>  s=20 sin 20 -1/2 x9.8 x(0.53)^2<br>  s=20 x 0.34 -4.9 x0.28<br>  s=6.8 -1.37<br>  s=5.43 m<br>  so the height of ball above the ground where the ball will strike the wall=<br>  5.43 +0.60=6.03m|`|9v1kDcquaa	OK, break up the initial velocity of the ball into horizontal and vertical components.  Gravity changes the vertical component only, so there will be a constant horizontal velocity of (20 m/s) sin80 = 19.7 m/s <if you don't know why it's sin 80, draw out a triangle to break up the initial velocity)<br>  <br>  displacement = velocity * change in time, so t = 10m / 19.7m/s = 0.51s<br>  <br>  Now we calculate initial vertical velocity: (20m/s) cos80 = 3.5 m/s<br>  Now we use use the equation displacement = initial velocity * change in time + 1/2 acceleration * (change in time)2<br>  <br>  displacement = (3.5m/s)(0.51s) + 1/2 (-9.8m/s2)(0.51s)2 = 0.51m<br>  <br>  Thus it hits the wall 51cm higher than it started, which was 60cm above the ground, so 111cm above the ground.<br>  <br>  As for whether it's going upward or downward, find out how long it takes the ball to stop going upward, using final velocity = initial velocity + acceleration*change in time<br>  <br>  0m/s = 3.5m/s + (-9.8m/s2)t<br>  t = 0.36s<br>  <br>  Since 0.51s is after 0.36s, the ball was travelling downward.

Ftkr9jqYaa	High temperature:  High temperature tends to increase metabolic rate unless reaching the point at which it denatures enzymes.  Of course, any temperature above the optimal temperature at which an enzyme functions will decrease metabolic function.  Eventually, cells may adapt to higher temperatures.<br>  <br>  Low temperature:  Lowering temperature tends to decrease metabolic rate.  If the temperature reaches low enough levels, temperature shock or hypothermia will occur.  Eventually, cells may adapt to lower temperatures.<br>  <br>  High (alkaline) pH:  Enzymatic function typically displays a curvilinear relationship with pH, whereby optimal metabolic activity tends to occur within a narrow range, which is most often near neutrality (pH=7), although digestive enzymes often function best in acidic pHs.  Alkaline phosphatase, for example, may have an optimal pH as high as 10.5.<br>  <br>  Low (acidic) pH:  Most enzymes function optimally at a neutral pH, but among the digestive enzymes whose activity is greater at acidic pH are pepsin (optimal pH of 1.8 to 3.5) and gastric lipase (optimal pH 5.4).

In other words, you have not actually *read* Darwin, except for the out-of-context snippets that you see quoted in dishonest Creationist web sites that *OMIT DARWIN'S VERY NEXT WORDS*:<br>  <br>  "...It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological Record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time."<br>  <br>  In other words, Darwin asks a question, and then answers it.   But these sites quote only the question, and then OMIT THE ANSWER ... to leave the impression that Darwin was "admitting defeat".  Only the most dishonest of people would engage in this kind of deep-seated deceit.  (I don't blame you ... just the dishonest sites you have been duped by.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Your third mistake is in thinking that any question that Darwin may have had about the fossil record has not been answered in the 150 years since the early years of paleontology in which Darwin lived.  (The science of paleontology itself was only about 38 years old at the time Darwin published those words.)   Since then, *of course* we have found a *LOT* more fossils ... enough to know that the *pace* of evolution is not constant and would not provide a smooth continuous record at all times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally, your fourth mistake is that, after believing these dishonest Creationists sites and their willingness to lie about *what Darwin was saying*, you also believe their claim that there are "no transitional fossils."

It's not just a single tooth, bone, or fragment.   It's *hundreds*!    If they find a complete jaw-bone in one area, with certain shaped premolars, and they find a premolar identical in shape but a little smaller, in the *same layer* and a nearby region, then they can infer from that that they may have a different specimen of the same species, but perhaps a female or a juvenile of the same species, and from growth patterns they can some times tell the age of the individual, etc.   It's a jigsaw puzzle, and they write papers going into minute detail about *WHY* they believe it tells them something.<br>  <br>  My point is that these scientists live, eat, and breathe fossils ... for a living.  They don't just look at a photograph and decide "that is or is not a transitional fossil" ... they hold fossils in their hands, they, they measure them, examine them with a microscope, they include data about the exact location (down to the inch) where they were found and the layer of dirt in which they were buried, and compare this with equally detailed examinations of *hundreds* of other specimens.  They are not stupid people.   Really, they are not.   Your willingness to believe that these people are willing to jump to outrageous conclusions based on "only a single tooth" is just insulting and unfounded.   <br>  <br>  >"Also, these transitions are honestly a little bogus in the first place: we have know that the DNA found in a cell never adds to itself, it only replicates."<br>  <br>  ??? Have you not heard the word "mutation"?   Most mutations are neutral ... they have neither harm nor benefit.  Some are slightly or extremely harmful, and they don't last long.  But some mutations are slightly beneficial.  Those are the ones that spread into the population.  That's called 'natural selection.'   And those represent the DNA that is "added to itself."    Do they not teach this in your school?<br>  <br>  Again, please just read a book on introductory paleontology or genetics ... rather than rely on on these truly BAD Creationist sites that absolutely *depend* on you not having any background in these fields.  That is why these web sites sound persuasive to you at the very time they are considered HORRIBLE sources of scientific misinformation by anybody who has actually studied these things.|`|cEJwY5byaa	Darwin wrote that 150 years ago.  We have huge amounts of transitional fossils today.  Go to ANY natural history museum and they will have some out for display.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite is Tiktaalik - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik</a><br>  <br>  You are also misquoting Darwin.  Or, more specifically, quote mining him.  Where did you get that quote?  Whoever you got it from is being dishonest, because in *the very next sentence* Darwin answers the question:<br>  "It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote."<br>  <br>  You can read what he wrote in context here - <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/origin/chapter6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/origin/c...</a><br>  <br>  Much better than reading the dishonest quote mining that you get from lying creationist sources.<br>  <br>  Anyways, to answer your question, there are multiple lines of evidence that support evolution, fossils being only one of them.  It was the original one, but we've learned a lot since then, and even without a single supporting fossil, we'd still have enough evidence for evolution to be well supported.  The fact that we have all this incredible fossil evidence just makes the evidence that much more solid.<br>  <br>  To reply to Esther:<br>  "we have know that the DNA found in a cell never adds to itself, it only replicates"<br>  <br>  This is completely wrong.  We have many observed examples of DNA producing novel material and function.  While replicating, DNA makes replication errors.  At that point, it's plainly obvious that the DNA is adding something new.  It's then up to natural selection to decide if the new material from the replication error is to be eliminated or propagated.<br>  Here's my favorite example of new DNA being added - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_lon...</a><br>  <br>  You have to ask yourself, if these anti-evolution people are right, then why can't they argue honestly?  Why do they have to say things that are so obviously untrue (such as saying there are no transitional fossils, or that DNA can't add to itself)?  The only explanation is that they are lying, because they have had their errors pointed out to them many times.<br>  So why do they have to lie about it?

cEJwY5byaa	I think you've mixed some pseudoscience nonsense into your pop-science reading.  I know Michio Kaku didn't say anything about souls or moving to 'higher dimensions', I own several of his books and I know he's a real physicist and not a goof like that.<br>  <br>  Riemann didn't prove anything about 'n-number of dimensions'.  He came up with the 'Riemann curvature tensor' which involves fourspace (4-d) but that's going to be way over your head unless you've had at least some vector calculus.  But that has nothing to do with 'higher dimensions'.  'N-number of dimensions' doesn't actually mean anything.  'N' is just a term for generalization.  If I say I have 'n apples' it only means I have a specific number of apples, but I'm not defining what that number is.  It's just an algebraic term, like x or y.  'N-number of dimensions' just means some number of dimensions, it has no physical meaning without defining N.<br>  <br>  Einstein was never knighted, if that's what you mean by calling him 'Sir'.<br>  <br>  One thing that I know Michio Kaku explains but you seem not to have understood is that '10 dimensions' or whatever number of dimensions is just a hypothesis, there's no evidence that it's the most logical formulation of the universe.  It's a mathematical trick to make calculating certain things easier.  This doesn't mean there are 'higher dimensions' you can travel around in.<br>  <br>  'Higher dimensions' is a misnomer.  They're not 'higher' like up or down, it's just higher or lower numbers of dimensions.  A dimension is a direction of movement, nothing more.  It's nothing mystical or spiritual.  IF a 'higher dimension' existed, we would be living in it right now.  It's not something you can only access with certain 'energies' or whatever.<br>  <br>  More advanced math and physics often use fourspace and more to work certain problems.  It has absolutely nothing to do with some special 'plane of reality' or something, it just makes the math easier for some problems.<br>  I remember seeing a 50-dimensional problem in my linear algebra class.  50 dimensions sounds really 'high' and mystical, right?  Nope, it was just a problem calculating the profit made by a company selling 50 different items in several different store fronts.|`|EqfIQMzQaa	Wow that's interesting I only thought there were 3 dimensions.|`|x5Wet11Naa	Who knows how many dimensions there are.

If you can imagine the first 4 dimensions being (space and time) imagine that all of the sudden everything defined by those first four was put in an box and you could observe that box from some reference point which was somehow disassociated from the box. All of the defining values of this box would now be relative to the fifth dimension, and thus it would no longer be a box. It has taken me months to wrap my head around this. Many other explanations say the fifth dimension is some type of emotion or something but then it may only apply to things capable of emotion. The box story is the best ive heard so far. Good luck!|`|4K3jzOUzaa	we can not percive them i know the answer but that will take time for explanation,actually we can percieve only through our sences our sences are only capable of sencing 3 dimension higher dimension do exist .how do you percieve time ,through logic higher dimension are also percieved in similar fashion,through logic that is through mathemetic,equation actually made us fel how they look like,when you solve a simple problem including power,energy time and all,you are dealing with those dimensions ,but you dont feel it but reimann or einstein ,even gauss euler do have feeling for that|`|2BL6Ow4Maa	how can we percieve them? i guess the same way you percieve that the 5th and 6th are after life... and further on are pretty much left to the imagination, i guess you can just guess what that energy builds to and is used for else where?|`|QLotskOJaa	people say that theres max seven dimensions !! <br>  <br>  they say god is on the 7th dimension !

Look at one of these.  Remember that 30-60-90 triangles have sides in the ratio of 1:√3:2.

Picture it lying with one vertex pointing straight up. Now draw a line perpendicular to the base to that vertex. This line is an angle bisector, and creates two right triangles. <br>  <br>  For each right triangle, the base is 5s and the hypotenuse is 10s. The only side you're missing is the height of the triangle. However, you know that sin x = opposite / hypotenuse. In this case,<br>  sin 60 = height / 10s  --> height = 10s sin 60.<br>  <br>  So now you have the height of your equilateral triangle. Recall that the formula for the area of a triangle is 1/2 x base x height.

I don't mean the answer is unknown--it's impossible, even in principle (as far as we can tell) to answer it.<br>  <br>  Skipping the technical details, any event before the big bang is not observable, nor would any information about such events have survived the big bang (there's no way of telling if there was a "before," in fact.)<br>  <br>  Many people (including some scientists) don't realize that science is not capable of answering every question we ask. Some people duck the issue by declaring "such questions are meaningless."  Which is absurd--questions such as "does God exist" or " what is moral" are equally outside the boundaries of science--and either dismissing such questions or distorting science by trying to force it to answer such questions (as some religious extremists do) is equally wrong.<br>  <br>  Science --by definition--deals with--and ONLY with--questions about what can be observed or measured in some way. Other questions aren't meaningless--tey simply are outside the limits of what science is capable of. Trying to make science gives that kind of answer is like trying to make a skyscraper fly--it's a great building, but it's not an airplane and trying to pretend it is is simply wrong.|`|z2xy34ufaa	Not what but who and that who is God.|`|4LrOVUgnaa	this question did.|`|LQlrD4Juaa	Chuck Norris lit one of his farts<br>  true story

It is using the trigonometric identity sec^2(x) - 1 = tan^2(x).  That's how the tan^2(y) got there.  When you take the square root of this value, you get (sec(y)tan(y))/tan(y), which reduces to sec(y).  It's probably in the front cover of your book (or somewhere around there), that the integral of sec(x) is ln |sec(x) + tan(x)|.  That's where that came from.<br>  <br>  Now, you aren't done yet.  You need to substitute back in for x.  To do this, sec(y) gets changed back to x.  You then need to construct a right triangle.  Choose one of the angles and label it y.  sec(y) = x/1, so using the definition of secant, the hypotenuse of your triangle is x, and the adjacent side to the angle is 1.  Use the pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other side, sqrt(x^2 - 1).  Finally, tan(y) = opp/adj = sqrt(x^2 - 1) / 1.  So, the backsubstitution results in ln |x + sqrt(x^2 - 1)|.  Sub in your values using the fundamental theorem of calculus and you are done.
bhbnDilwaa	This question is about colligative properties. This is the formula you'll be using:<br>  <br>  Freezing point depression = i * Kf * m<br>  <br>  i is the van't Hoff factor (basically how many ions are produced in solution) and m is the molality. Naphthol isn't an ionic substance (I don't think so, right?), so we don't have to worry about the van't Hoff factor.<br>  <br>  m = moles of solute / kg of solvent<br>  <br>  We need the molar mass of the solute and the mass (in kilograms) of the solvent to find the molality.

AA10655250	The Four Corners is a region of the United States consisting of southwest Colorado, northwest New Mexico, northeast Arizona and southeast Utah. The name comes from the Four Corners Monument, located where the four states touch — the only location in the United States that is on the boundaries of four states.<br>  <br>  The United States first acquired the area now called Four Corners from Mexico after the Mexican American War in 1848. The area was first surveyed by the U.S. Government in 1868 as part of an effort to form the state of Colorado, the first of the Four Corners states formed. The Four Corners was established as the jurisdictional boundary in 1901 when the boundaries of the Arizona Territory were established.

This is clearly related to velocity.  <br>  <br>  And since momentum is conserved in collisions, you can see how this might affect the damage of a car crash.<br>  <br>  Further, force is change in momentu/change in time.  So if collisions occur in the same time frame, then the one with higher momentum changes will cause more damage (force).  <br>  <br>  In this sense, it isn't necessarily the velocity that is dangerous but the combination of mass and speed.

EX:  A parked car in neutral can be pushed to a new position with relatively little effort.  On the other hand a car going at 100 mph that suddenly goes into netural is something you wouldnt want to try and push.    The solution lies in the fact that in order to move the car you had to apply a certain force for a period of time.  Lets say the velocity you gave it were 1 mph.   For the car moving at 100 mph if you gave it same force for the same time it would indeed decrease in speed to 99mph before it hit you.|`|qcsqsvEYaa	Mass and inertia are interchangeable terms. <br>  Mass is dependent on velocity but only for relativistic velocities, that is, approaching the speed of light.<br>  With regards to traffic accidents, I think velocity has more to do with problems than inertia. Traveling at higher speeds reduces the amount of time available to make corrections and avoid potential problems. But that can happen with high speeds for small cars and large trucks equally, so mass is not really an issue.

cWuumdy7aa	compressed natural gas is the full form of CNG.Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is a fossil fuel substitute for gasoline (petrol), diesel, or propane fuel. Although its combustion does produce greenhouse gases, it is a more environmentally clean alternative to those fuels, and it is much safer than other fuels in the event of a spill (natural gas is lighter than air, but disperses quickly when released).<br>  <br>  CNG is made by compressing natural gas (which is mainly composed of methane [CH4]), to less than 1% of its volume at standard atmospheric pressure. It is stored and distributed in hard containers, at a normal pressure of 200–220 bar (2900–3200 psi), usually in cylindrical or spherical shapes.<br>  <br>  CNG is used in traditional gasoline internal combustion engine cars that have been converted into bi-fuel vehicles (gasoline/CNG). Natural gas vehicles are increasingly used in Europe and South America due to rising gasoline prices.<br>  <br>  In response to high fuel prices and environmental concerns, CNG is starting to be used also in light-duty passenger vehicles and pickup trucks, medium-duty delivery trucks, transit and school buses, and trains.<br>  <br>  CNG's volumetric energy density is estimated to be 42% of LNG's (because it is not liquefied), and 25% of diesel's|`|efe48b2704958e20b36597e1775c5058aa	Natural Gas does not 'Come out' in bursts.

NbdTgyLPaa	You can't actually solve the problem as you wrote it.  The total percentage of the sum of each component must be 100% if we are given all factors in the grade.  Since these only add to 70%, then there may be something else that counts for the 30% (e.g. homework).<br>  <br>  However, to show you how it's done, I will assume you made a mistake for the exams, and they are really worth 50% and not 20%.  Then we start by calculating the pieces....<br>  <br>  For your lab, you have 89% * 0.25 = 22.25%<br>  <br>  Assuming 100 is the maximum on each exams, then for your exams, you have (58%+ 90% + 85% + 80%)/4 = 78.25% average score.  And that is going to be 50% of the total (based on my change, not the problem as originally stated), so 78.25% * 0.5 = 39.125%<br>  <br>  We don't know the score for the final, but the total you want to end up with is at least 85%.  There is already 22.25% from labs and 39.125% from exams, so 85% - 22.25% - 39.125% = 23.625% is what is needed from the final.  Since the final is 25% of the grade, then the score needed would be 23.625% / 0.25 = 94.5% to get an overall 85%.

l90SUmkjaa	There always exists a time delay between when information leaves a source to when you receive the information.  You experience this when you send a text message to a friend or when you are reading your computer screen.  Nothing in the universe can happen simultaneously, if it could it would violate the theory of special relativity-- nothing can travel faster than light.<br>  <br>  The further away an object is, the larger the time delay between the sending and receiving of a signal (which for this case is the light from a star).  Since a star is so very far away, it takes a very long time for light to reach our eyes... hence the delay.  It is this delay that allows astronomers to say that we are looking into the past when we view the star.  Being that the light from a star took many years to reach us... the light we see is how the star looked many years ago.<br>  <br>  Time, as it were, is a real entity.  I have heard many people say that time does not exist... this is inaccurate.  Time does exist.  The second law of thermodynamics demands the existence of time as well as time flowing in only one direction.  Quantum mechanics (the time dependent Schrodinger Equation) demands time to exist, as does the theories of Relativity.  Time is a real entity... it is fundamentally linked to physical law as well as symmetries in nature.  People that say that time does not exist or that time is an illusion clearly misunderstand physical law.<br>  <br>  Your question is a great one.  Keep pondering your questions.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)|`|AA11032982	there is time, what are you talking about. there is a definite ARROW OF TIME that points to the future. the second law of thermodynamics says things increase in enthropy over time, and order would actually INCREASE if time went backwards. therefore, time must move forward.|`|cEJwY5byaa	But there IS time.

The same way inches and feet and miles are units of measurement for distance, and they're just made up too.  But nobody says there's no such thing as distance, because distance itself is still real, just like time itself is real.<br>  <br>  The 'time doesn't exist' thing is just a stage that all young (typically high school or early college) wannabe philosophers go through.  I went through it too.|`|JkS5JHtWaa	When you look at a star you are looking at the past because the light from the star does not reach earth instantly.

This means that events can be observed differently (in a different sequence) from different points of view. <br>  <br>  Imagine two points of view in your example.  POV#1 is from the beam of light, speeding from point A to point B.    POV#2 is from an observer at point B.   For ease lets say that A and B are one light year apart.  <br>  <br>  Relativity says that Observer #1 would see no time pass.  From that POV the trip would be instantaneous.    Observer #2 would see the trip take the normal amount of time; 1 year.  <br>  <br>  So from our point of view, light travels at light speed, and takes a finite amount of time to go from point A to point B.   <br>  <br>  Since no material object could possibly travel at C, POV#1 is irrelevant.

30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	I really do not know the reason, but the reason culd be as under.<br>  <br>  In most competitions, there is the importance of the first three rankers. It is possible that the words, first, second and third were coined for the first three winners. One having rank four was never recognized for prize distribution. So no special word was coined for rank 4 and so on. Then the words to denote them in English were fourth, fifth and so on.<br>  <br>  Moreover, first, second and third are more catchy as compared to oneth, twoth and threeth.|`|sRvHkvJ2aa	It's just a matter of the English name for the term. Everything after the first three number have the suffix -th. That's just how we call it. It's the sixty-fifth term, or the hundredth term, or the thousandth. <br>  <br>  The number 1, 2, and 3 are special, because they're not called one-th, two-th and three-th, but first, second and third. <br>  <br>  In fact, any number that ends in these numbers (with the exception of the -teens) should be suffixed with -st/-nd/-rd. For instance, it's 101st (hundred and first) and 102nd (hundred and second).|`|EuN4zRCLaa	This is likely because the first three were in common use before an organized naming pattern was developed.  Also, there are different source language groups.  Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate gives these etymologies:<br>  <br>  first: Middle English, from Old English fyrst; akin to Old High German furist first, Old English faran to go<br>  <br>  second: Middle English, from Anglo-French secund, from Latin secundus second, following, favorable, from sequi to follow<br>  <br>  third: Middle English thridde, thirde, from Old English thridda, thirdda; akin to Latin tertius third, Greek tritos, treis three|`|D5QgyGbXaa	first origin: bef. 1000; ME; OE fyr(e)st (see fore 1 , -est ); c.

For example, we say "fifty-first", "fifty-second" and "fifty-third". <br>  <br>  I think it's because English has so many different influences from other languages, and the names of "first", "second" and "third" just had different origins.  "Second" comes from the Latin "secundus", whereas "one" and "two" have the same origins as the German words for one and two, "eins" and "zwei".  <br>  <br>  If you think about it, we do have other words that describe ordinal position or number without using the names "one, two, three, four..." or "first, second, third, fourth...".  We can talk about a first place politician as "PRIMARY candidate".  We can talk about two objects by saying "BOTH of them".  After we get past 2 objects though, we start grouping them together less distinctly.  I'm guessing that this has a relation to why words like "first" and "second" are used instead of "oneth" and "twoth".  At least "third" has some more letters in common with the word "three"!<br>  <br>  A lot of the other number names in English match with German in odd places, which is also why we get eleven ("elf") and twelve ("zw?lf") instead of "oneteen" and "twoteen".

6099a6cf10dd1a0b4a82921e69638406aa	A line of massive boulders on the western shore of Tonga may be evidence of the most powerful volcano-triggered tsunami found to date. Up to 9 meters (30 feet) high and weighing up to 1.6 million kilograms (3.5 million pounds), the seven coral boulders are located 100 to 400 meters (300 to 1,300 feet) from the coast.<br>  The house-sized boulders were likely flung ashore by a wave rivaling the 1883 Krakatau tsunami, which is estimated to have towered 35 meters (115 feet) high.<br>  <br>  “These could be the largest boulders displaced by a tsunami, worldwide,” says Matthew Hornbach of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics. “Krakatau’s tsunami was probably not a one-off event.” Hornbach and his colleagues will discuss these findings at the Joint Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA), Soil Science Society of America (SSSA), American Society of Agronomy (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and the Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies (GCAGS), in Houston, Texas, USA.*<br>  <br>  Called erratic boulders, these giant coral rocks did not form at their present location on Tongatapu, Tonga’s main island. Because the island is flat, the boulders could not have rolled downhill from elsewhere. The boulders are made of the same reef material found just offshore, which is quite distinct from the island’s volcanic soil. In fact, satellite photos show a clear break in the reef opposite one of the biggest boulders. And some of the boulders’ coral animals are oriented upside down or sideways instead of toward the sun, as they are on the reef.<br>  <br>  Hornbach says the Tongatapu boulders may have reached dry land within the past few thousand years. Though their corals formed roughly 122,000 years ago, they are capped by a sparse layer of soil. And the thick volcanic soils that cover most of western Tongatapu are quite thin near the boulders. This suggests the area was scoured clean by waves in the recent past. Finally, there is no limestone pedestal at the base of the boulders, which should have formed as rain dissolved the coral if the boulders were much older.<br>  <br>  Many tsunamis, like the one that struck the Indian Ocean in 2004, are caused by earthquakes. But the boulders’ location makes an underwater eruption or submarine slide a more likely culprit. A chain of sunken volcanoes lies just 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of Tongatapu. An explosion or the collapse of the side of a volcano such as that seen at the famous Krakatau eruption in 1883 could trigger a tremendous tsunami.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that a storm surge could have brought the boulders ashore. But that scenario isn’t likely. No storms on record have moved rocks this big. Another possibility is that a monster undersea landslide caused the tsunami. But Hornbach’s analyses of adjacent seafloor topography point to a volcanic flank collapse as the most probable source of such a wave.<br>  <br>  “We think studying erratic boulders is one way of getting better statistics on mega-tsunamis,” Hornbach says. “There are a lot of places that have similar underwater volcanoes and people haven’t paid much attention to the threat.” The researchers have already received reports of more erratic boulders from islands around the Pacific. Future study could indicate how frequently these monster waves occur and which areas are at risk for future tsunamis.<br>  <br>  The boulders are such an unusual part of the Tongan landscape that tales of their origins appear in local folklore. According to one legend, the god Maui hurled the boulders ashore in an attempt to kill a giant man-eating fowl.<br>  <br>  And though many other Pacific islanders follow the custom of heading uphill after earthquakes, Tongans have no such teachings. Such lore may be useless for near-shore volcanically-generated tsunamis, which arrive too quickly for people to evacuate. Instead, most of Tongatapu’s settlements are huddled together on the northern side of the island—away from the brunt of the tsunami threat.<br>  <br>  *The abstract “Unraveling the Source of Large Erratic Boulders on Tonga: Implications for Geohazards and Mega-Tsunamis” will be presented on 5 October 2008.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	There are a couple of different ways to do this, but here's one idea:<br>  <br>  Draw this as a circle centered at the origin with raidus r, where N = (0,r) and E = (r,0).  Let P = (rcos(t), rsin(t)) for some value of t beween 0 and 2pi exclusive.  Then point Z is therefore the x-intercept of line NP, and NE = r√2.  We need to show that NP * NZ = 2r^2.<br>  <br>  Since NP contains the points (r,0) and (rcos(t), rsin(t)), then the formula the line is <br>  y - y1 = m(x - x1)<br>  y - 0 = [ (rsin(t)-0) / (rcos(t)-r) ] (x - r)<br>  y = [ rsin(t) / r(cos(t)-1) ] (x - r)<br>  y = [ rsin(t) / r(cos(t)-1) ]x - [ rsin(t) / r(cos(t)-1) ]r<br>  y = [ sin(t)/(cos(t)-1) ]x - [ sin(t) / (cos(t)-1) ]r<br>  <br>  This means that the y-intercept is -r[sin(t) / (cos(t)-1)]. So Z is the point (0, -r[sin(t) / (cos(t)-1)]).<br>  <br>  You have the locations of points N, Z, and P.  So use the distance formula to find the lengths of NZ and NP, then show that their product is 2r^2.

If they are not, I have an counterexample:<br>  a = i<br>  b = i<br>  a x b = 0<br>  c = j is orthogonal to a x b but not complanar with a and b.<br>  <br>  A simple proof can be done using Gramm-Schmidt orthonormalization process. As a and b are l.i., a x b is nonzero, orthogonal to both of them and linearly independent with them. That is, the triple (a, b, a x b) is a basis. Perform the G-S process: during it, a and a x b are only rescaled (guess why), b is replaced by a different vector. Let's call the new basis (a', b', c'). Now as r . (a x b) = 0, so is the third Fourier coefficient r . c', meaning that r belongs to Span{a', b'} which is equal to Span{a, b}.<br>  <br>  Maybe there is some better approach.<br>  <br>  2) Using the result of 1), as r = a x (b x c) is coplanar to b x c, it must be a linear combination of b and c: r = αb + βc. Now r . a = (a.b)α + (a.c)β, but this must also be zero, meaning that α = k(a.c) and β = -k(a.b) for some k.<br>  <br>  It can be shown that k = 1, that is, the following identity holds:<br>  a x (b x c) = (a.c)b - (a.b)c.<br>  <br>  3) Generally not, for example<br>  i x (i x j) = i x k = -j<br>  (i x i) x j = 0 x j = 0.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

dkS8XHAwaa	covalent bonds and compounds are bonds that experienced between two elements. These bonds are actually shared "valence" electrons. Valence is a coined term that refers to the the electrons in the outermost shell of the atom. In family 1, there is 1 valence, in family 6 there is 6. The trend typically follows an octet rule of sharing to satisfy the atom. The octet trend is desired because it emulates the electron configuration of the noble gases, family 8. Please be aware though that starting after the third period, elements may hold more than 8 in its valence shell.<br>  <br>  The reasons why sometimes double bonds and triple bonds are necessary is because of the necessity to form the full octet. For example, oxygen has only 6 valence, but we find oxygen existing as O2 naturally. How this occurs is double bonds, because we have 6 valence, and 2 are spent to form double bonds from each oxygen, so there are a total of 4 shared electrons. Each oxygen then has 4 unpaired electrons which allows a complete octet configuration for both atoms.<br>  <br>  The similar situation goes for N2. Since there are only 5 valence electrons, each nitrogen shares 3 so there is a total of 6 shared and 2 unpaired, thus resulting in an octet.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|PpMA8Tcxaa	well i only have a high school junior education of it so far but it is the opposite of ionic bonds.  it is usually a bond between two negatively charged atoms (like CO2) <br>  uhh double and triple bonds are when more bonds are required to share the electrons so that the atoms will not be charged.  that's how molecules try to form.  the first bond is a sigma bond(normal) . the double is one sigma and one pi bond ( the pi bond is sort of orbitally shaped).  triple covalent has one sigma and two pi bonds.|`|fasxIGpfaa	A covalent bond is the bond formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons by two atoms.<br>  <br>  Covalence is the number of electron pairs that an atom can share with other atoms.<br>  <br>  That's all I got.

GASTNilgaa	I'll assume that you know that F[x] is an integral domain, and you just want to understand why it is a principle ideal domain.<br>  <br>  Recall the notion of the "degree" of a polynomial.  The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined; the degree of a nonzero constant polynomial is 0, and the degree of a more general polynomial sum a_n x^n is the largest value of N for which a_n is nonzero.<br>  <br>  If J is the zero ideal, then J is generated by the single element 0.  If J is nonzero, then the set {degree of f(x): f(x) in J} is a nonempty subset of the positive integers, and hence has a least element, d.  We can prove that any f(x) in J that has degree d is a generator of J as follows.<br>  <br>  Fix f(x) in J with smallest degree.  By the division algorithm we can write any polynomial g(x) in J in the form<br>  <br>  g(x) = q(x) f(x) + r(x)<br>  for some element q(x) in F[x] and some element r(x) that is either 0 or has degree strictly smaller than that of f(x).  But the equation<br>  <br>  r(x) = g(x) - q(x) f(x),<br>  since g(x) and f(x) are both in J, shows that r(x) is in J.  We conclude that r(x) = 0 (since if r(x) had a degree, it would be strictly smaller than that of f(x), and that is a contradiction).<br>  <br>  Conclusion: if J is any ideal in F[x], then either J = 0, in which case J is generated by 0, or J is nonzero, in which case J is generated by any element in J of minimal degree.  In either case J is generated by a single element, so F[x] is a principle ideal domain.<br>  <br>  If you did want to know why F[x] is an integral domain, note that if f(x) and g(x) are nonzero, then f(x)g(x) is also nonzero because its "leading term" (the coefficient of the highest power of x) is the product of the "leading terms" of f(x) and g(x) (which are both nonzero since f(x) and g(x) are nonzero).  Since a product of nonzero elements of F is nonzero, you conclude that f(x) g(x) is nonzero whenever f(x) and g(x) are.

sa8dElLZaa	Volcanoes vary a great deal in their destructive power. Some volcanoes explode violently, destroying everything in a mile radius within minutes, while other volcanoes seep out lava so slowly that you can safely walk all around them. The severity of the eruption depends mostly on the composition of the magma.<br>  <br>  Gas vents from Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii<br>  <br>  The first question to address is: why does the magma erupt at all? The erupting force generally comes from internal gas pressure. The material that forms magma contains a lot of dissolved gases -- gases that have been suspended in the magma solution. The gases are kept in this dissolved state as long as the confining pressure of the surrounding rock is greater than the vapor pressure of the gas. When this balance shifts and vapor pressure becomes greater than the confining pressure, the dissolved gas is allowed to expand, and forms small gas bubbles, called vesicles, in the magma. This happens if one of two things occurs: <br>  <br>      *  The confining pressure decreases, due to decompression from the magma rising from a higher pressure point to a lower pressure point.<br>      * The vapor pressure increases because the magma cools, initiating a crystallization process that enriches the gas content of the magma. <br>  <br>  In either case, what you get is magma filled with tiny gas bubbles, which have a much lower density than the surrounding magma, and so push out to escape. This is the same thing that happens when you open a bottle of soda, particularly after shaking it up. When you decompress the soda (by opening the bottle), the tiny gas bubbles push out and escape. If you shake the bottle up first, the bubbles are all mixed up in the soda so they push a lot of the soda out with them. This is true for volcanoes as well. As the bubbles escape, they push the magma out, causing a spewing eruption.<br>  <br>  Read more here -<br>  <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/volcano3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://science.howstuffworks.com/volcano...</a>|`|3F77EM46aa	its an active volcano...
30XHbV35aa	You can, but I can think of two reasons why it might be unwise. Firstly, reinforcing bars are ribbed to provide a key between the concrete and the steel, whereas scaffolding bars are much smoother. This leads me to believe that scaffolding bars, weight for weight, wouldn't be as effective as reinforcement bars and you wouldn't have as much reinforcing action as you think. In extremis, you could end up with an under-reinforced concrete beam which will be brittle - reinforced concrete is usually deliberately slightly over-reinforced so that the behaviour close to failure is ductile, as it gives you time to run away. Secondly, scaffolding bars are hollow and reinforcement bars are solid. In reinforced concrete, the alkalinity of the cement paste helps to protect the reinforcement from corrosion - the reason for specifying a minimum cover - but the inside of your scaffolding bars would not benefit from this and so I'd worry about the risk of shortened life due to rusting from the inner face.

Artificial satellites tend to orbit with the earth, so that if you look up in the same direction from the same spot at any time of the day, the satellite will be there.

If it didn't orbit with the Earth, it could only be used at certain hours of the day, whenever it's overhead. Which is inconvinient.

29anpqmjaa	CAM plants (like the pineapple) have a reversed diurnal stomatal respiration cycle, whereby they open their stomata during the night, instead of the day.<br>  <br>  In hot dry environments this means they can take in CO2 during the cooler night periods and reduce water loss by evapotranspiration, and store the CO2 as an acid (which is what the A in CAM stands for) overnight to be broken down and metabolised (the M in CAM) during the daytime.<br>  <br>  C4 plants have a different enzyme to 'regular' plants which increases the speed in which CO2 is absorbed and photosynthesised.  Sorry I don't really remember more about C4 plants.|`|YYLybWHSaa	1 -  C3 plants are slow because they use rubisco & natural rates of diffusion of both H2O & CO2 gases.<br>  <br>  2 - C4 plants speed up the diffusion rate of CO2 by driving it into storage at a slight cost. This allows the stomata to close sooner so less H2O is lost.<br>  <br>  3 - CAM changes how the stomate opening is timed so the gases are exchanged at night, and the CO2 is sequestered by the C4 pathway. Time delay plus physical CO2 storage.<br>  <br>  Both water and CO2 are rate limiting factors to the photosynthetic process but CO2 is acquired by the same means water is lost - through the stomata. This means there is a conflict of use in the dual function of the stomata. <br>  Strong sunlight means high heat so the stomata need to close to stop water loss. CO2 must be taken up by the slow inefficient protein rubisco for photosynthesis so the stomata must be open in a normal C3 process.<br>  <br>  The answer is to separate the functions of saving water and getting CO2 by using the C4 process. The physical separation costs a bit more in energy but conserves water very well so C4 works best in warmer climates with intense sunlight. C4 adds a step that grabs and stores the CO2 in a separate space from the pore. This lets CO2 diffuse into the open pore faster so the opening can be closed sooner costing the plant less water loss. This is what requires the extra energy, moving the CO2 faster so more can diffuse down the gradient the plant creates. <br>  <br>  CAM plants add yet another separation of time to allow the plants to open their pores at night when even less water will be lost.  The stomata are open at night to have a controlled release of water vapor to drive the upward pull of water and its dissolved nutrients in transpiration and to store the CO2 needed for photosynthesis once daylight returns.<br>  This is why tropical grasslands are C4 and temperate forests are mostly C3.|`|omxHZoJeaa	CAM plants are adapted by closing their stomata during day time and opening during night time just to avoid transpiration, because they are xerophytic in nature with having succulent leaves. Henceforth, in CAM plants photosynthesis i.e., assimilation of CO2 takes place during night time.<br>  Whereas in C4 plants the assimilation of CO2 is more than in C3 plants as the C4 plants shows Krantz anatomy of leaf i.e., bundle sheath cells also contain chloroplasts along with mesophyll tissue in which photosynthesis takes place. Hence CAM and C4 plants are more efficient than C3 plants concerned to photosynthesis.

The tail is right under the surface of the water when it happens.  Sometimes you will see a series of these footprints, meaning the whale is swimming just beneath the surface of the water.  If you only see one (as in your picture), then the whale probably dove when it made that footprint.<br>  <br>  Here is a good picture of gray whale footprints when the whale was swimming just beneath the surface (they are marked by boxes):<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/orcagirl/12429911/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/orcagirl/12...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a single footprint made by a whale as it was diving:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68834561@N00/2828209765/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/68834561@N0...</a>|`|c751fbc25b64e2d55123a16ac0df41b8aa	I don't know about grey whales<br>  But scientists have discovered using various gizmos, that blue whales can go deeper than our present submarine technology<br>  <br>  I know other whales use circles in swimming to herd fish so they are easier to catch.
fHmuLYheaa	Well if you want a "hydraulic" press it's pretty much the only way you can go. :^)|`|cqrrcJhBaa	Its the power effeciency of hydraulics.  For example, say you have a hydraulic cylinder that is only 3" in diameter.  If you put a mere 500 psi on that cylinder you would generate 3,534 lbs of force.  Most hydraulic pumps can put out 2,000 to 2,500 psi and are generally inexpensive.  The way to calculate hydraulic force on a cylinder is as follows:<br>  Pressure * Area = Force<br>  With a 3" cylinder you will have an effective area of  7.0686 sq.in. calculated like this:  3*3*.7854= 7.0686 sq. in.<br>  Now just multiply the area by the pressure and you get the amount of force.

It runs round this pulley up to another pulley fixed to the ceiling, round this pulley and down to a hook, from which hangs tray 2. Before getting into the bath, you put a sponge and a rubber duck in tray 1, which descends into the bath. When you have finished washing with the sponge and playing with the duck, you put the sponge back on tray 1, get out and put the duck on tray 2. If it is heavier than the sponge, it brings the sponge out of the water straightaway, otherwise you have to add the soap and shampoo bottle to tray 2.<br>  <br>  You read it here first.
vek0uFQKaa	I understand what you are asking and will answer without the ignorant sarcasm of conscious control of the muscles as some seem to find appropiate to give as an answer. I do not know if they think they are being clever, sarcastic, mentally limited or too closed minded to grasp your intent and give an answer that may be of value to you.<br>  <br>  Gary Y seems to find that science is limited away from areas that are more profitable but the research does also reach into the area you question about.<br>  <br>  Dragonfly 42 has mentioned remote viewing which is one of various areas along with quantem physics/mechanics. She is accurate when she asks about having the mental boundries and mental fortitude needed to apply yourself along with being responsible as to boundries that one needs to be aware of crossing. This is not a question of ability but rather how and at what risk along with being responsible as to what is done with the knowledge.<br>  <br>  You could immerse yourself into learning quantem mechanics, about matter and antimatter, and subatomic particles as mentioned by Bill P. In time you could develop some method to test give proof of the existance of these abilities and over years of experimenting become the one that is known for finding a way to harness and control it.<br>  <br>  On the other side you could decide you do not care about the ability to show proof and rather experiance it for yourself. If this is more toward your direction, expect ridicule and not to be taken seriously among most people who base their knowledge on what Gary Y would refer to as real science. I do know a person who has been involved in this direction for the past few decades. To start with you may learn and practice shamanism which has shown paralells in some areas with particle physics. Along with shamanism, you would be wise to combine the practices with those of various pagan religions. This promotes an open mindedness and acceptance of things that are natural although beyond "normal" science and control. This is one of the factors I am told promotes more success. Then comes learning methods such as remote viewing and other things that are not openly discussed. The person I know has done this along with combining US research and that of the former Sowiet Union along with what seems to be non related practices. He lives near Mannheim, Germany which was one of the centers of research prior to WW2. It seems to still be active there although predominantly hidden from public knowledge. I also know that he has had involvement with US intelligence so much will probably not be open for the public. I have been involved/witness to some activities and will say that there is potential beyond what people generally fantisize about. Beyond that I will not confirm or deny anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck if you decide to pursue either direction. It is a very long and difficult way but I believe well worth it even if you just see the results.|`|R1ER4yXFaa	Yes it is.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read up about it, initiation into hemetics by franz bardon is a good book, you have to train your mind to be able to control the energies of the universe.<br>  <br>  It's not easy at all, and should always be looked upon as an incidental attribute to your spiritual development, or you may, (and probably will) get used.|`|4zspYrGXaa	Okay, this could take hours of discussion, but briefly. Will is difficult to define, much less harness. However, intent we can play with.<br>  If we are to be purely "scientific" I think the best research into this matter [forgive the pun, totally unintended :-)] Then you should look at the two areas of research that Dr. H. Puthoff [physicist] and Brian Smith [Dr. not sure] are doing with Zero Point Energy.  Grasp his concepts, for they are on the cutting edge of real science, and his other research into remote viewing. There you will find your answers. Intent is very important to any actions of the type you mention.<br>  <br>  My biggest concern is with this: Do you really think you have the mental boundaries and the moral fortitude to attempt this? I am fascinated by Quantum Physics, but am careful as I am unsure of the boundries we should cross. Good luck in your search.|`|bHPB2CuUaa	Absolutely. The other two answers above are onto it. For instance, when I drive my car, my intent causes the gas pedal to move and the engine to convert chemical gas energy into kinetic energy, thus moving the car (matter) from one point to another. Also, turning the steering wheel directs the car matter from one possible future into another, with the car ending up in a whole different place than it would have if one had not turned the wheel. This sort of thing happens all the time, with everyone, whether or not they recognize these abilities or not. If you want an example of manipulating the raw energy of the universe, as crystallized matter into energy, I would think of the atomic and hydrogen bombs. Long and intentional effort by lots of smart people managed to convert ACTUAL CRYSTALLIZED MATTER into PURE ENERGY in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Who could ask for anything more? I, for one, sort of wished they hadn't. But that doesn't negate the facts.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	of course! ill do that for a living!<br>  (im an engineering student).|`|6rTK303aaa	If science ever achieves this, it won't be paranormal, but a natural phenomenon.  However you are using a lot of pseudoscientific sounding words here.  You are misusing the term "energy" which is a measurement of work capability.  Real science has higher priorities for its funding buck.|`|mjrLWAbXaa	It greatly depends on what you count as energy, how you define focused intent and what influence you wish to demonstrate on matter. Certainly every brain cells that fires (energy) in some way influences matter (your breathing to driving a car).<br>  There is some exciting research going on with these ideas. <br>  (see links below).<br>  <br>  Psiexploration|`|IVy35SE2aa	In her book, "Love without End, Jesus Speaks" author Glenda<br>  Greene claims that He told her about sub atomic particles<br>  that comprise everything in existence. I think she referred to them<br>  as adamantine particles.  A statement made was, Love commands<br>  the adamantine particles.<br>  <br>  Mrs. Greene is a college professor, not a kook.|`|a1VK1L64aa	yep, its called work and has achieved many amazing things. Focused intent will not get you any significant results alone, but it will get you started.|`|De4vgWXPaa	Yes.  For example, from a carefully deliberated intention, I can switch on a light and that influences matter.

The only logical reason for any alien civilization to expend the time & effort it would take to get here (and go out of their way to avoid being seen on their way) would be to eat us or to take our stuff, ergo, while alien life is entirely probably, they haven't been here yet!|`|6rTK303aaa	There are more options than just crazy or joking.  You could be seeing these things in dreams, you could be hallucinating, you could be high, deluded, mistaken, or plain lying.  Or they could be real after all.  <br>  <br>  There is no hard evidence that anyone has ever seen an "alien", and it is very improbable.  I would need more details to determine what is going on here.  When do you see them, where do you see them, what do they look like,  can anyone support your claim, any witnesses, any physical evidence?

nTKuRFlKaa	*Please read the following.<br>  <br>  Vent-hole - a hole for the escape of gas or air vent, vent hole, blowhole<br>  air duct, air passage, airway - a duct that provides ventilation (as in mines)<br>  hole - an opening deliberately made in or through something<br>  smoke hole - a vent (as in a roof) for smoke to escape.<br>  <br>  *The purpose of venting a gas appliance is to remove the products of combustion.<br>  <br>  For gravity or natural draft venting, the sole energy source is the heat above room temperature in the combustion products or flue gases that are delivered to the vent collar or draft hood outlet of an appliance. The cooler, heavier room air forces the lighter combustion products upward. The difference in weight (buoyancy) between the hot flue gases and surrounding cooler room air causes the draft which makes the venting system function.<br>  <br>  However, if this energy source is insufficient, then problems will occur in the venting process or action such as:<br>  <br>     1. Spillage of the flue gases at the appliance draft hood (or diverter)<br>     2. Condensation of the water vapour within the flue gases<br>  <br>  Therefore, the overall purpose of venting is the removal of the products of combustion without spillage taking place at the draft diverter and condensation of water vapour occuring within the vent and the appliance.<br>  <br>  Natural draft appliances become spillage susceptible with a negative building pressure greater than 0.02" WC (5 pa)<br>  <br>  A flue gas or vent loss of not less than 17% would generally necessitate a vent gas temperature at lesat 140° (60°) above its dew point.<br>  <br>  Building that have a negative building pressure that is greater than 0.02" WC (5 pa) which is caused by range hoods or exhaust fans (i.e. restaurants or factory etc. hot water tank installation) should not employ a nature draft or a fan assisted appliance.<br>  <br>  For eg.:<br>  An exit passage constructed in a casting mold to allow gases to escape during the casting process.<br>  <br>  *Self-priming pumps need a vent or bleed line installed between the pump discharge flange and the discharge check valve, back to the suction source. Without this vent the pump will not be able to deliver enough pressure to open the check valve. There will be some loss through this line when the pump is operating, but the alternative is to have someone open and close the valve every time you start the pump or install some type of an automatic valve that will open and close at the correct time.<br>  <br>  Priming a pump:<br>      *  Install a foot valve in the suction piping to insure the liquid will not drain from the pump casing and suction piping when the pump stops. Keep in mind that these valves have a nasty habit of leaking.<br>      * Evacuate the air in the system with a positive displacement priming pump operating between the pump and a closed discharge valve.<br>      * Fill the pump with liquid prior to starting it.<br>      * Convert the application to a self priming pump that maintains a reservoir of liquid at its suction.|`|e23hKMegaa	venting is open to the atmisphere priming is pressure in line

If you have questions about classes, you should talk to one of your university's career counselors to get a suggested class list (if you're university doesn't have pre-vet, do the pre-med requirements). Check the websites for the schools you want to attend to see what their specific requirements are since most veterinary schools have slightly different requirements.<br>  <br>  Generally, you need to take<br>  1 year biology<br>  1 year general chemistry<br>  1 year organic chemistry<br>  1 year biochemistry<br>  1 -2 semesters of physics<br>  cellular biology, microbiology, embryology, anatomy, physiology.<br>  <br>  Some veterinary schools also require animal nutrition, economics, and encourage animal husbandry classes.<br>  <br>  Most veterinary school require that you spend time working with a veterinarian and animals before you apply. Often 500+ hours. so get a job working in a clinic or volunteer with an animal organization before applying.<br>  <br>  Veterinary schools also require that you take either the GRE, MCAT, or VCAT.<br>  <br>  You can major in anything as an undergrad as long as you have all of your requirements done, however people usually major in a science like animal science, biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, microbiology etc<br>  <br>  There are 28 veterinary schools in the United States (if you are not in the US, then pretty much none of this applies to you, sorry) you can check out their websites. Try <a href="http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/colle..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/colle...</a> or <a href="http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/veter..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/veter...</a><br>  <br>  Getting into veterinary school is far more competitive than getting into medical school, so good luck!

This will allow, at times, very cold air masses from the far north to move south and at other times allow very wa rm and moist air from the far south to move northward.  Sometimes they both come at the same time and you get those very nasty severe weather outbreaks over portions of the United States.

mjrLWAbXaa	Most of the problems with rapid advances in technology center around ethical issues that the technology forces us humans to address.<br>  For example, Oppenheimer after creating the Atomic bomb wanted it's power demonstrated to (not used on) the Japanese in order to allow them to surrender before causing such devastation. The US decided it couldn't risk a failed demonstration.<br>  <br>  The Human Genome project that will allow us (eventually) to manipulate genes to correct birth defects in the womb also allows us to choose a child's hair and eye color (possibly other features) and this reminds many of the Nazi attempt to create a Master Race.<br>  Most medical schools now have ethical boards that are struggling with such issues in training of doctors and what laws and regulations to suggest and support about these issues.<br>  <br>  So, it depends on both the type of technology and the human issues involved in it's use.

I believe that marijuana isn't legal because there is no way of measuring "how high" somebody is.  This is very important when driving.  I have driven under the influence of marijuana several times and while it not as debilitating as alcohol, it certainly can impair you.  I've smoken marijuana hundreds, maybe even thousands of times and I stopped about a month ago with no withdrawal effects or anything.  For this reason I believe marijuana is not addictive.  But again, that depends on your definition of addictive.  It is a nice feeling and some people might say you can get addicted to the feeling.

See what happened was, the hemp plant was being seen for all it's incrediable uses, over 10,000 i think. Well the paper industry was not to pleased seeing that this product would put the timber industry of of buisness when making paper products. So the owner of the paper industry (his name slipped my mind) made up tons of lies and pressured the government to make it illegal. Also, as many of us know, we were very rascist. So as the use of cannabis became more popular among mexicans (who gave it the spanish name "marihuana", thats right, thats the correct spelling) people were terrified that people who smoked it would become more like mexicans, and all that stereoptyipcal crap. so it was eventually outlawed. Since then, it has been fought for for legaliztion, but failed. One group worth looking into for info is National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws, or NORML.

91bhiXTVaa	You might want to make the general public your audience, instead of animal testers, because the laboratory technical community will know the fallacies behind the usual arguments against animal experimentation.  <br>  <br>  For instance, anti-animal experimentation arguments usually claim that a variant of the Ames test (where a compound is tested against cell cultures of bacteria or even animal cells, to see if it has harmful effects)  is a way to eliminate animal testing.  In reality, the interaction of the compound in an actual organism may prove useless as the kidneys filter the compound or the liver detoxifies it.  The compound that was safe and effective in a cell culture, could just be safe in an animal as it's eliminated before it can affect the cancer it was designed for.<br>  <br>  So, if you pick "scientists" as your target audience, don't pick biologists or anyone in the medical fields.

This will remain the case until the food source that sustains them is removed from the area.<br>  <br>  You can keep on poisoning each new wave of ants, forever. Be aware that this presents some risk to you and your family too.<br>  <br>  Often there will be fruit decomposing in the soil for several years after all fruit trees are gone, and some kinds of ants even live on the wood of fruit tree roots. <br>  <br>  Scraping off ant hills as soon as they appear, distributing the ant hill over the ground when the sun is shining hotly will reduce the number of them around.

First, there is no test on the planet or amount of marijuana you can smoke in three days that would show up in a blood test a month later. Second, it's unlikely (but not impossible depending on the reason) that you are getting a blood test for drugs, and more likely it is a urine screen.  Third, cannabinoids can be detected in urine up to about 60 days after last use depending on how often you smoked (e.g., in a heavy, daily user, up to about 2 months).  In your case, depending on the quality of the weed, should be out of your urine by most tests in 1-2 weeks so you are at some risk.  If you can postpone the test for 2-3 days you should be fine.  Alternatively, if you cannot delay the test, I would be sure to go to an independent lab (try the phone book in your area and make an appointment - you don't just walk in) and be tested 2-3 days after.  If you come up positive on the first test, your second test should be clean and you can use it to argue that the first test was not correct.  Sorry to hear you were clean for so long then relapsed a week before a drug test.  Good luck|`|dPgP28Aiaa	If you haven't smoked weed in 5 months then you'll be clean.

It depends on your weight (i think fat percentage specifically). It can take up to 30 days to clear from your system, but that's normally for heavy smokers. It depends on what kind of test you're getting too...but it's most likely a urine test, and they're the easiest test to fool.<br>  <br>  I once stopped smoking for a week (i smoke daily) and took a drug test and passed it. I drank about 6 liters (almost making yourself sick) right before the test. I drank water the night before and that morning as well. At the time i was about 145 (I'm female and 5'7). When I peed for the test, my pee was clear. Sometimes they won't accept that, but they usually do.

It was like 50 american dollars (kinda pricey) but worked in 2 hours. They sell cheaper ones that take 2-3 days to work. They taste alright and you do have to drink like a gallon of water with it. And the instant drink works better than the 2-3 day one (i failed the test they give you right there with the 2 day one, but then they called me back and told me when they sent it to the lab, i had passed it).<br>  <br>  I do have a friend who is 6'8 and about 240 pounds (a male) who was caught by the police smoking a blunt.

wXaGIPSPaa	Protistans are eukaryotes. They have a nucleus, large ribosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and golgi bodies. Many species have chloroplasts. Some protists divide by way of mitosis, meiosis, or both. The majority of protistians are single-celled, but nearly every lineage also has multicelled forms. Protists are important for the use of food. Saprobes resemble some bacteria and fungi, and some predators and parasites resembles animals. Some are heterotrophs and some are autotrophs. Chytrids, water molds, slime molds, protozans, and sporozans are heterotrophs. <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/P/Protists.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...</a><br>  <a href="http://students.ncwc.edu/bio101/protista/Default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://students.ncwc.edu/bio101/protista...</a>

J7h0C66Baa	We and the world would survive without bees.  Our diets would become much more bland and uniteresting though. Most of the plants<br>  that originated in the Americas and utilized by the Native Americans are wind pollinatied: Corn,Beans and the Squash and Pumpkins and Maple trees for example. If the bees disappear we are not going to fall off the edge of the earth and be eaten by dragons. The sun would still remain the center of our solar system. Like the dinasours, in a few decades we'd be studing to figure out why they went extict.|`|pd6hbk0saa	not very long.<br>  <br>  i'm guessing about a week?|`|wLADk4OPaa	about five minutes|`|91bhiXTVaa	"Bee Movie" dealt specifically with the Honeybee, Apis mellifera.  There are other species of bees out there. like bumble bees and solitary bees, that are also involved in pollination.  I'm assuming you mean the loss of Apis mellifera because of the movie and because of the threat of "Colony Collapse Disorder".  Yes, there really is a disease that is wiping out honeybees, to the point that some people are afraid they really will become extinct.<br>  <br>  First, unlike the scene in "Bee Movie", existing plants would live until they died at their usual age.  <br>  <br>  Trees might last for centuries, while annual plants (that need to grow from seed every year) would die at the end of the season.  <br>  <br>  Next, recall that some plants like the grass family, ragweed and some others have wind pollination.  So we'd still have corn and wheat, and lots and lots and lots of ragweed, as it moved into the areas left open by the demise of the annual plants.<br>  <br>  Some plants are pollinated by flies.  Sometimes flies pollinate normally bee pollinated plants by drinking the nectar, but the stinky flowers that attract flies by smelling like rotting meat or worse, would thrive.<br>  <br>  So the world would continue, but the nature of the plant community would change.  The world would become less colorful as flowering plants reduced to a lower population where flies and different bees could pollinate them.  Stinky fly pollinated flowers would become common and so would allergies, as ragweed multiplied to fill in the space left by the missing flowering plants.<br>  <br>  And maybe, just maybe, Politicians wouldn't complain that money for study of colony collapse disorder is "pork" and "wasteful spending".<br>  <br>  Naaa.  Politicians would just blame each other for the loss of bees, and Rush would say that near global extinction is a small price to pay to make liberals look bad.|`|1LZdc4K5aa	If you're referring to the common honeybee (Apis Melliferra) it would probably still survive. Although there would be a food chain collapse, there are still different species of pollinating insects that might take the bees place.|`|Dlb2fKtlaa	in my opinion we dont really need bees|`|1tHVDSRJaa	Scientist estimate less than 5 years. <br>  We have enough vegetation stock piled to last till then.<br>   But after that?|`|jhJ6AGkVaa	Not much.

KLfx3JQYaa	1) You can pump blood continually and not tire your heart out.  The left side pumps while the right side rests and vice-versa<br>  2)The Right atria has to pump blood to the lungs, which is a lot less blood at a time and a lot shorter distance.  The left (bigger) side has to pump much more blood throughout the entire body.<br>  3)Not positive, but I'd say once the blood needs to go back it simply enters a vein where it is returned to the heart.
1LZdc4K5aa	A cow eats grass, which is tougher to break down and process into energy, which is why it has four "stomachs." An elephant eats forage, which although hard to break down, doesn't require quite as much work. The real digestion in an elephant ocurrs in its large intestine where there is a huge sacculated (divided into many smaller divisions) caecum. There bacteria ferment the forage into a simple absorbable cellulose.

y0MnsQRNaa	Hydro electric dams are rare for many of the same reasons nuclear power plants are rare. <br>  1. Large capitol investment up front for long term payback. <br>  2. Environmental impact is very difficult to prove / achieve approval<br>  3. Geographical / topographical conditions for a dam/reservoir are rare<br>  4. Safety - prove there will never be an accident|`|V8jIAEmBaa	First, most of the best hydro sites have already been developed. We are not growing any new rivers! Thus, available new sites are marginal already, and developing  new sites has become extremely expensive.<br>  <br>  Upgrading some sites is possible, but seldom economical. Most were sized adequately to use the average available water, and most flows are decreasing as more and more water is diverted to agriculture, domestic, industrial, and commercial use. Adding peak capacity has minimal value, and capital improvements are discouraged as noted below.<br>  <br>  Second, many of the smaller sites are not considered economical, so people don't bother. Dam maintenance and such is often considerable. As dams age, they often require major work, and are just shut down instead.<br>  <br>  Finally, the federal government considers dams to damage the environment, mostly fish reproduction, but also land use for the reservoir and other issues. Besides adding new expensive regulations to discourage new dams or keeping old ones in operation, since the early Clinton days, they have systematically bought or otherwise acquired dams, destroyed the dams, and sold or given away the remains. Your federal tax dollars at work!<br>  <br>  Going into the Obama regime, coal, hydro, and nuclear are no-no's, and vast new regulatory and tax impacts are imminent.

77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	The drug side effect of "memory loss" in other than anesthesia drugs (like Versed) is not long term memory loss (stuff you learned and had committed to memory). In my experience, it affects short term memory (like what you had for breakfast, or what was  that last item you forgot at the grocery store although you knew when you left home).<br>  Short term memory loss can be compensated for by writing things down that you want to remember later, like the website you heard about on TV, grocery lists, and appointments.<br>  Patients tolerate drugs differently.

You could also put out some cut up fresh fruit and see what come around. If the weather is starting to warm up you can go examine leaves.  Insects will usually be found on the underside of leaves. <br>  <br>  Be sure to keep something moist in the jar (like a damp cotton ball) or the spider will dry out.  Some place to get out of view is also good.  A couple of leaves would do.<br>  <br>  Try this site for more information<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-from-school-9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.authorama.com/free-from-schoo...</a>|`|91bhiXTVaa	Spiders don't eat dead prey.  Fruitflies and aphids are good sized for that size of spider.  If it is too cold where you are to find them in the wild, spiders can go without food long enough to order some fruitflies from a catalog.  Try Googling "biological supply company and fruitflies".|`|JTwQdKsNaa	kill the ant then give it to him
TMB4d3FAaa	Yes you can grow blueberries in Iowa. We grew them near the headwaters of the Des Moines river in Currie in the 1950's. We got our stock from "Fields" catalog. They sent all the information we needed to acidify the soil.  How deep to plant, how much fertilizer etc.  I bought some other things last year and still have my 24 page booklet on "Complete Planting Handbook.  We grow Blueberries here in Indiana.  So they have you covered.  Grow as many Blueberries as you like.  The way you raise corn in Iowa, Blueberries will be a cinch.|`|743f401bac126bdc42eda174751e5d3caa	Blueberries grow in an acidic soil and much farther north than Iowa.  Check with the county agricultural agent to find which varieties are the best for your locality.  Or check with a good garden center (not a big box store) for recommendations of which varieties are good for the area.

CDHrN5UPaa	Engineering is about designing and fabricating things. With Civil, it involves structures like buildings, bridges, roads, etc. Obviously, with Computers, it involves the structure and function of a computer, from the computer chip design to the operating system software. One big difference is the tangible aspect of what you build. With Civil, most of things you will deal with are large in physical scale and very tangible. With computer engineering, many aspects are either microscopic and or electronic so they are dealt with in a computer environment. Another significant difference is that Computer Engineering is a much newer field. It didn't really exist more than about 30 years ago. So, it is still rapidly evolving.
