1Dshgmywaa	I've been trying to remove this for hours. I finally got a hold of someone at Symantec, and they just wanted my money for tech support to interface and take the virus off my comp.    My Norton 360 scan shows that the affected files are Limewire previews. I cannot manually delete them. It's asking for permission, then saying that permission is denied.    I didn't try the Symantec removal tool yet...you said it didn't work for you. I don't know what to do. I don't want to re-format my damn computer!     Maybe restore to an earlier date? Everyone on here is reporting they got this virus today, or that it made itself apparent today. My affected files were DL'd in October. Does anyone else know the dates their files were affected?    Sorry I couldn't answer your question. Guess we're all in the same boat.    Edit: I sent you an email because I didn't see the edit button, lol. They said $99.99. I'm not resorting to that price just yet!      EDIT (again): SUCCESS!    Run the removal tool in safe mode (press and hold f8 during start up)    After my scan was complete, the tool told me I had no trojan. It was incorrect, because when I re-started Windows in the normal mode, Norton still said I had threats.    HOW I GOT RID OF THE TROJAN:  I located the file names of the affected areas. Go to "details" and you should find these files--most likely Limewire. Again, in safe mode, I deleted the files and then re-started normal and ran a virus scan resulting in NO trojan.    So I guess just figure out what files are messed up and delete them in safe mode.  I also deleted Limewire and Bit Torrent. I'm over the virus **** and don't know enough about computers to figure out what is safe to DL and what isn't. Hope this helps some people!|`|bWa1HGS3aa	Wow...that is so weird....i got the same exact one today also...    trojan.brisv.a!inf    i wonder what it is?|`|XUoan51jaa	I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM!

tOCESHLYaa	Norton by far. Ad-Aware does a fine job on ad-ware. But is not that strong on tough spyware. Ad-Aware will remove ad-ware but it's not something you would want to have to depend on for things like Spyware Guard 2009. Plus if you want a good anti-spyware program then SuperAntiSpyware is much better than Ad-Aware. Norton 2009 is fast.It has a high removal rate and detection rate.|`|89PlrybAaa	Norton would obviously be the one to score.

ZRyFMe0gaa	Yes and no, in your case if you have maxed your system w/ ram then yes there is a limit, Ex: 32bit windows and only address 4gigs at once so the memory from your videocard will be subtracted from the 4gigs total (or w/e your maxed at) ~ Lets say its 4gigs your at and your adding a 512mb video card, then that will be subracted from the 3.5 gigs or ram that windows uses so you'll be left @ 3.0 gigs.  Now if you have a 64bit OS on there then your fine, the 4gigs wont be touch, and depending on the application all of it may be used, plus the video memory will be there as well.  Long stroy short if you are max on 32bit windows you will lose ram by installing a beefy card but u wont lose any on a 64bit OS.  I had this problem b4 when i added two nvidia cards to my system and my ram went down to 2.25 gigs.  Reinsttalling a 64 bit OS fixed that thou~|`|0fb8bc0361a3c044e8ab71aede839879aa	Nope it shouldn't matter as long as the port on the board is there (if it's PCIe make sure you have a PCIe port and connector on the power supply unit if it requires additional power).    As long as you have a dual core CPU and at least 512MB of memory, you can probably run any modern graphics card. Check the requirements for the card and make sure your PSU (power supply unit) has enough power to power the card (the card may require a 6pin PCIe power connector).|`|8ttynrbfaa	If you are using a 32 bit operating system, then you may have a problem.    Simply put, all memory requires an address for the operating system to access it. On all 32 bit versions of windows, this limit equals 4GB of address space for ALL memory in a computer. Now, to make it complicated, windows also uses some of that address space for other things besides memory... to access them faster, like communication ports. So you cannot even use the full 4GB... easily. Using PAE (Physical Address Extension) can sometimes allow you to use all memory, at the cost of stability... but that's more complicated than I should get into.    In short, if you have 4GB of RAM, and purchase a video card with 1GB of RAM on it... you may not be able to use it all on a 32 bit version of Windows.

Type in "dxdiag" in the prompt (without the quotation marks), then when the box loads, go to the display tab.  Under or next to "name" it will say what type of card you have.  This is for Windows XP, so if you have something else it may not work.

AA10519682	In Pageflakes' case the site began experiencing problems early Thursday, which coincided with several other sites from parent company LiveUniverse going down. These sites, including LiveVideo, MeeVee, and Revver are all currently offline (which in Revver's case appears to happen a lot).    We contacted Live Universe founder and CEO Brad Greenspan about it, who says the downtime is simply a part of migration to a new data center in Los Angeles that has "lots of servers." Greenspan also said that the sites should be back up in the next few hours.           This was published on Jan 30th so it was suppose to be back up a couple days ago. They must be taking longer then they thought.

RyvKws7Laa	There is no better option.  The better option can only be determined by you when you sort out what your needs are.  You should "test drive" both and see which you like more.  You're the one using it your computer, not all of us on the Internet.  So you should be comfortable with it, who cares what we think.    Also, you need to figure out if you're hands-on or hands-off with being able to troubleshoot/fix computer problems.  If you're hands-on then either system is fine.  If you want to do a lot of tweaks on your own then Windows is better (its easier to do OS tweaks).  But if you're hands-off then you need to look at your support network.  Your friends, family, colleagues, and local computer stores, what kind of help can they give you easiest?  If there isn't a lot of Mac support around you, are you still sure you'd want to go Mac then?  Not that your Mac will break down, but its a computer so it will likely give you some problem at some point.    If you really want a Mac though, the current OS comes with Boot Camp.  That will allow you to install Windows natively onto your Mac.  So then you can boot up into Windows just as if you had bought a IBM clone machine.  Then you can boot up into whichever setup you want depending on what your needs are at that time.    So be honest about yourself as a computer user and you can then figure out which is "better."|`|2LHgmq97aa	PC is better...    With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

AA11312040	Don't use tables, especially if you have dreamweaver. Create a CSS class, title adLeft, for example. Set its top, left, width, and height properties to the precise pixel locations on the page you want if you are using a static, not dynamic page. As the earlier answer indicated the position attribute should definitely be set to absolute.     Repeat the same for the other ad, title this adRight, though.     Add a third class, mainContent, for example. Place this where you would like it and type away. The text will expand as necessary, while the ads will stay where they need to.     This is accomplished in Dreamweaver through the "CSS Styles" tool, select the "New CSS Style" icon.

IND refers to an Indeterminate value.    Hope that helps.|`|BChKHLRXaa	There are a few things that you should ALWAYS provide error checking for when you write a program that solves math equations.  There are two that you have overlooked in your problem: finding the square root of a negative number, and dividing by zero.    Decide what you want your program to do in these instances, and set up the error checking.  You may want to prompt the user for new input, or you may want to decide what they really meant, etc.  It's really up to you.      In this case, if "dis" results in a negative number, there are no real roots to your equation.  The square root of a negative number is not undefined, it just results in an imaginary number, which the sqrt() function is not able to handle. You could simply tell the user, "This function has no real roots." and skip over the rest of the math.

RyvKws7Laa	You need to set the margins to 0.  Don't assume they just default to there.  So create your DIV or such and then set the margins to 0.  And if you want hard left and hard top, make sure its both Left and Top set to 0.|`|AA11092020	All browsers have their own default method for display content, which is why any serious web designer has to have a slew of different browsers installed to test their page.    For example, Internet Explorer automatically adds about 20px of top-margin to any image element, whereas Opera adds about 10px, Firefox adds about 8px, etc and so on.    You can easily modify the img tag to correct for one browser.  For example, in IE you can use         and that will flush the image with the top of the browser in IE, but in Opera it will move the image 10px past the top viewable area of the page, making it look ridiculous.  You can easily correct for this issue regarding IE and FF by using non-compliant coding:      img top {  _margin-top: -10px;  margin-top: -20px;  }      then below:        But, this only corrects for two browsers, and there are many.    The only way to successfully do this is one of the following ways:    1. deal with not having the image flush with the top of the page.  2. create separate stylesheets that load depending on which browser is being used (the HTTP packet sends this information in the header to the web server).  3. instead of trying to flush the image with the top of the body, create your own block-level container for your page and place everything within it.  In other words, make the body the parent element to the container of your page:        ALL SITE CONTENT GOES HERE        I hope this information is useful to you.
FBQZ06vraa	You can't, really.  The installation of any decent sized program these days puts files not only in the program's main directory, but in several other various directories on the machine.  Sometimes, the files installed on one machine may not be on another machine.    The installation also puts pointers to some of these files, in particular, to the Uninstall file for Remove Program, in a big system file called the Registry.  Moving those files to another drive can badly confuse Windows.      In short, the only reliable way to move a program is to uninstall it and reinstall it on the other drive.    Sorry.|`|78xcSNrKaa	You can't store things on a modem what the hell are you talking about?|`|i7hGcvXBaa	you can't copy programs like that as they need to be installed.

zorYTX59aa	Even if your video has successfully "uploaded"  and "processed", YouTube's servers must still  "database", "index", and "categorize" your vid   such that any computer around the planet can  then access and watch your video. This whole  other 'process' can sometimes take days and  explains why you may get one of the following:  -- your video still doesn't appear in My Videos;  -- your video is indeed there, but no thumbnail;  -- your thumbnail is there with all the video info, it is "live" and "public"  but when you click it, you get the message "this video is unavailable";  -- your video is on your profile page but does not appear in YouTube's   search results, even if you type in your video title and your username.    Like I said, the entire process can sometimes   take several days. How long has it really been   since YouTube received your video?    Once your video finally is in the public domain,  there is the strange possibility that YouTube's  computer algorithms have yet to figure out the  20 videos which should appear in the "Related   Videos" section. Don't be surprised if that part  doesn't show anything right away and is blank.

lt2CKQpzaa	Hey Dude! I have been HOTT for one of these lil phenomenal toys. Did I say toy? Yes- To some that is what they are. Consider, that w/ the Atom processor, and the wussy FSB speed, you are gonna get the performance level of a 2-3 yr. old average consumer notebook. There is limited success with video on em. Gaming? Why? I can't see anything on a 9" screen. Notebooks have caused a fever pitch for people who equate small with advanced technology. Acer rules, BTW- The Msi Wind MIGHT be my fav, but the AspireOne rocks. The HP and DEll offerings are good, but appeal to those looking for more of an upscale appearance. Honestly, you can get the Atom, the Via or CeleronM and that's pretty much it. Later this year there will be some new offerings to enhance the video performance. Will be cool with the 10" screens. The SSDrives that come w/ ANY of em, bite. They are not what you would expect.Replacments are horrible expensive. The ol mechanical drives still are the leader based on speed vs. cost. The BIG thing is that these things are L I G H T- and make a cool fashion statement. I've messed with n Asus 900 HA and the 900A and the Aspire one. Check the used market 1st. I grabbed the 900HA for 320 including a external dual layer DVD RW. The 900A for less than 200 bones.

Also the screen size is small and mouse placement is a little off. It's not a bad laptop but do some research into it before you go and buy it. Oh yea and from what I understand about the acer one is that Acer has to do all the repairs which means if it breaks you have to send it away to get it fixed. I could be wrong on this but that's what i have heard about it so far.|`|iob3tt0uaa	I bought the same one from walmart two months ago and it just died today.  It won't get past the windows loading screen before giving a blue screen of death and restarting, so theres no way to even get safe mode to load windows to go in and scan for viruses or try to fix things.  I think it's probably a hardware failure, such as a burnt out ram chip, or something heated up too much and desoldered itself.    The battery lasts 2 hours, but for $70 i bought a 7800mah 9-cell off eBay that will last for 7 hours.  I enjoy that i can carry it with my college textbooks and it isn't huge or requiring a backpack, and it's lightweight.  It's decently fast, better than my 3 year old ho-hum desktop i use at home.    It won't run 3d games worth a hoot, but it can and has, and the onboard speakers are awful, but most laptops' are.  The touchpad allows zoom functions like an iPhone, where you put two fingers on and spread them apart, and it zooms in to any webpage (nice with the sometimes cramped 8.9" screen) and you can vertically and horizontally scroll using the edges of the touchpad.  I hate touchpads, so i use a mouse, but it's the best touchpad software i've seen yet.    Anyways maybe mine died for no reason, or got a virus, so don't let that discourage you.  They're great, and they stick it in the face of people who put $1300 into huge bulky laptops just so they can do... web browsing, email, and word processing, which this thing will do equally well.  And the whole time, making their huge laptops seem like uncool old people with huge old cell phones.

An old VHS will only work if you transfer it to a digital fileyoull need a digital converter to plug an older camcorder into the computer.

K1prVAsjaa	GO WITH FREE TOOLS. McAfee and Norton and the other pay tool suites have advantages, all-in-one firewall and virus/spyware/adware protection, but none of them are comprehensive, and the licensing issue is a hassle to keep up with. You only get so many free upgrades before you have to buy a new license.    All the tools have false-positive issues, especially the pay tools. Google each one to find out, or look them up on Wikipedia.    Best free is AVG, and it is good, it also has a spyware blocker for the browser, and I think a recently-added real-time heuristics montor. But they all seem to have their own suite of special features. Threatfire (free) has an excellent process monitor and heuristic-based virus detection (in addition to signature-based) and real-time protection; SpyBot (free) has excellent realtime spyware protection, along with a malware-website blocker, and a registry cleaner plus real-time registry guardian, and a startup program management tool (handy for speedig up your PC); Even AdWare (free) has added a real-time adware protection. And all of these except AdWare have a scheduler for automated updating and scanning.    Of the free tools, I think SpyBot has the most useful tool suite, but it is not anti-virus, just anit-spyware. I have all of these installed, along with ZoneAlarm (free) for my firewall.|`|u8P7HZpjaa	well i use McAfee n it works fine|`|UXq4s1d0aa	I find the best/ most secure is mcafee|`|hGO4rIyyaa	shield deluxe 2009  someone hacked onto my bebo account even thho avg thing came up with tha password safe fing they still hacked  i have avg its good but i still recommend shield deluxe|`|GY8fpm5haa	Free Edition =]|`|SOxdyWQOaa	McAfee my opinion|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	I would  NEVER use AVG.

A lot of the free alternatives are not too great, a lot have some strengths and weaknesses. AVG is one of the worst free antivirus programs because it is bloated, it is not good at detecting viruses, and it says that some files are viruses when they are not.    I recommend BitDefender for a well-rounded anti-virus suite or Avira Premium for best virus detection.

j3Px4JXfaa	Hi roborovskihamsters,    My name is Ron. I work as a part of the Windows Outreach Team and thought Id stop by to answer a couple of the questions you have regarding Beta testing for Windows 7.     Weve already established that Windows 7 is in Beta form right now, which means it isnt meant to be a permanent replacement for your existing OS in its current form. The current build is being tested until Aug. 1, 2009, at which time it will deactivate and users will be able to return to their previous OS or install the released version of Windows 7 (given that it is ready for market).    Make sure you read through the important information about backing up files and programs here: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows... before installing Windows 7. Youll need to have these files to restore your settings once the Windows 7 Beta is complete.    Once you are ready to download and install the Windows 7 Beta click over here to get the step-by-step guide: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows... The reason you need a DVD is because the file size of the ISO is so large it cant be contained on a regular disc.     If you do choose to go the dual-boot root, you can find information on how to do this here: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... Again, just to be on the safe side, Id recommend doing a backup of your files and settings.    Hope this helps out. If you have additional questions, feel free to reach out.

It can be either 1024 bytes or 1000 bytes.   In electronic memory where address identified by binary numbers it is 1024 bytes. In other types of media like HDD or networking it is 1000 bytes.   In SI standard it is always 1000 bytes, for 1024bytes there is a special notation - Kibibyte. However kibibyte is used really rarely and no one really cares about this standard.   So general rule is: if it is used in the context of Random Access Memory(including memory used by software) then it is 1024, if not then it is 1000 (there is a strange exception that for file sizes it is 1024 as well). But this rule is really vague. Many companies break it for marketing porpoises.|`|f1b6b1b26d3210d42e24c9cb20a453f4aa	The prefix Kilo- means thousand.

AA11764569	HP is a better brand.  Dell would put anything on their computers to control it, it would have problems connecting to a router that you have, etc. even uninstalling the software does not help  The good thing that HP does not do as dell does is put their own software to control the internet, hp might put bloat ware that you can uninstall but they won't put anything that vista/xp can control easy.    So go with HP.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	dell, but macs are better than both!    the only people who dont like mac are people who have never owned one!    once u go mac u never go back!|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	HP|`|eOb841qbaa	dell. well to me atleast (:|`|SLeX0gGaaa	HP  But over all brands i perfer alienware.  kthx|`|tnwkbYBcaa	macmacmacmacmacmacmacmacmacmacmacmacmacm...

RyvKws7Laa	You can buy DVI to HDMI cables and DVI to HDMI adaptors.  No need to get a laptop that simply has HDMI port in it.  If the laptop has DVI out then you can hook it up to an HDMI connection on your TV with the right cable/adaptor.  Then just get a stereo mini to RCA adaptor for the speakers/audio (or see if the laptop has optical out, some do).

eg9wjUQ7aa	I know that there are softwares for this. I couldn't tell you the name of one, besides http://www.logmein.com This will let you see what is going on with the other person's computer. It's actually for controlling a computer from another. Like for people who have business on one computer but have to go on a trip. However, when you log in you can see whatever the person who is on it is looking at. You can even control the mouse, but for secrecy i'd assume that isn't what you want to do. I work in a warehouse, and my boss recently installed a program that monitors what other people are doing on their computers, so i can't go to ebay at work anymore :( I'm sure you could do a little googling and find a paid or even free program that can suite your needs. Good Luck!|`|zvQ1lfuXaa	You may setup a parental control. If you have AT&T internet service, they have that kind of software.

a3C6DeNeaa	If you're not familiar with buying webspace and a domain name, building a website and hosting it online, I'd suggest you do like many other webcomic artists do and put your comic up on a webhost that's specifically for webcomics. The advantage of doing so is that these sites are usually set up with features and templates that make it easier to upload, archive, and maintain a webcomic site. Otherwise, you'd have to code those functions into your website yourself, and handle all the back-end maintenance yourself.    For webcomic artists who know little about creating and maintaining a website, it is much much easier to let established webcomic hosts sites handle all the work themselves, and concentrate on drawing and uploading comics.    Here's a list of different free webcomic hosts that have features that make it easier to upload and archive your comics.     Some free webcomic hosts are:    ComicGenesis  DrunkDuck  Smackgeeves  ComicDish  WebcomicsNation    All of these sites offer different amounts of space and features, so you should research them carefully to see if they fit your needs.    If you do know how to go about getting a webspace on a webhost and dealing with FTP, then I'd suggest using Wordpress and the Comicpress theme. Both PvP, Butternut Squash and a variety of other webcomics use.|`|ftAyBEHDaa	Use a CMS system, I recommend Drupal.

ZEx1o07baa	A couple of problems here...    First off, your  should really be  (this will make it work when you press return/enter).    Second, you should put your call to the zipValidate() method in your form's onsubmit event instead of the button's onclick event...  For example:    Then, instead of using document.zipForm.zip.value, you would use:  function zipValidate( f ) {  ??var val = f.zip.value;  ??//other code...  ??return false; // if you don't want the form to submit  }    Third, why are you using JavaScript for this at all? Your form will not work if JavaScript is disabled because it does not degrade gracefully and for no good reason. Plus, all one would have to do is look at your switch statement in JavaScript and go directly to the website that you're attempting to "hide". Very unprofessional. My suggestion would be to use a query string so that a page can be bookmarked (your form method should be "GET") in combination with server-side code.    The server-side code would either...  A: re-display the form with an error message if they got it wrong  B: perform a redirect to the appropriate page (based on the query string)  or C: display the client information using a single page which accesses data from a file or database based on the query string (instead of having a page for each client)    It would also be a good idea to modify your server-side-connected form to pass in a username and password (an appropriate use of the POST method) to protect your user's information even more... something difficult to do with JavaScript. Once you have that working, you can try adding some "unobtrusive JavaScript" to make the page better, though it should always work even with JavaScript disabled.    If you need some more help with this, feel free to contact me.

naVUguuHaa	I use my Facebook for family only. It's safer than Myspace; you can lock it down tighter. I like it because you can chat with people, lol.    Bad things... It can be kind of complicated to figure out at first. My parents freaked out when I told them I had a Myspace, but when I told them I had a Facebook, they didn't care (mainly because I only talking to family...). It's fun once you get the hang of it.

So that's 3 licenses, so 3 people total (you plus 2 friends).  You want to make sure no one is doubling up on a license so that things don't start to stop working because of license conflicts (plus because that would be unethical and you'd never do such a thing right?).
yMchHj9eaa	the X1200 is better, i think the 7500 has 64MB DDR memory and the X1200 has 128MB but the X1200 is shared memory meaning, it will take from your RAM to boost it. it is a good thing if you have 4GB of Ram in your machine.

The only thing I can think of is to take it out of it's case and put it in a computer like a normal hard drive.  If it still doesn't work, odds are you'll have to cope with what info you backed up.  If it does work, it was only a power issue with the case.<br>  <br>  That's what I'd do, but I've built a computer before, so I don't know if your average person can do it without specific instructions...

It is a huge and very complex field.|`|JSGJ8nV2aa	I don't think this is something that can be done on the cheap, not unless you want to put in a lot of personal effort (and I mean, a lot! Computer Programming is a deep and involved field)    However, you can pick up some of the basics with good tutorial websites. A lot of languages use some very similar structures in each of them, like "for loops", "if statements" and "functions" (if you understand what they are, then you're at least on the right path :) )    PHP is a relatively friendly language to start off with, you can see tutorials for it at sites like http://www.roughguidetophp.com and http://tizag.com    Robin  http://www.solarisedesign.co.uk

The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>   Often there is also spyware which is using your computer for nefarious purposes and slowing its operation.<br>  The answer is to scan your pc with a best anti-spyware to clean spyware/trojan/virus.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm</a>|`|or3H3VQ4aa	Well this can be lumped into one of two events.<br>  <br>  1) Your computer isn't really frozen but doing something that takes up so many resources that it *seems* frozen.  A common event that I run into with this effect are massive virus scans.<br>  <br>  2) A process can have taken over the input controls (or display controls) for your computer and then not release them.<br>  <br>  <br>  In either case there are a few steps you can try.<br>  <br>  1) Try using the Task Manager to see what is running on your computer.  More importantly, what is using the a lot of CPU time.<br>  <br>  Normally you can either hit Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the Task Manager.  You want to choose the Processes tab.  Then sort the list by CPU or CPU Time.  (CPU will show you what is processing right now and CPU Time will show you what your computer has spent most of its time doing).<br>  <br>  Another good tool is the Process Manager from the MS SysInternals team.  You can find the tool, here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysin...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  For more info on that I would suggest reading Mark Russinovich's blog as he covers a lot of troubleshooting technique:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Another usefully test would be to turn off any start up items and Services (this is one of the most basic trouble shooting technique used).  <br>  <br>  You can use MSCONFIG to do this.  To start the tool:<br>  <br>  *Go to the Start button > Run.<br>  *In the Run box type "msconfig" and hit enter.  The tool should then appear shortly.<br>  <br>  You can find detailed directions on how to use the tool by going to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2292" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2292</a><br>  <br>  <br>  (I know that is an Apple web site, but I don't want to type out all of the directions again)  Also note that depending on what version of Windows you are using the dialog box looks different.<br>  <br>  Once you have turned items OFF and restarted, work normally and see if it will freeze.  If it does not then one of the things you turned off is the problem.  You then have the fun task of turning things back on bit by bit.<br>  <br>  Eventually you will turn something back on and you will have the problem again.  When that happens you can be relatively sure that what ever you just turned on is causing the problem.<br>  <br>  As for answers that involving using a different operating system.  I currently have multiple Windows and Linux computers.  I have also worked on hundreds of Mac OS X computers.  In addition part of my day job involves working with the OpenVMS operating system.<br>  <br>  The reasons I described above happen on all of them.  No operating system is immune to either event, that is simply part of how hardware and software interact.
SsoeQ93Xaa	What computer version do you have? Some have DVD-RW/DVD-R and meaning that the computer can read and write files on DVDs and other older computers don't. You can check by looking on the slot where you put the DVDs and CDs and determine whether it says DVD-RW/DVD-R "DVD Rewritable". If it doesn't, your computer cannot copy DVDs. If it does, you can use:    Nero 9:  http://www.nero.com/enu/nero9-introducti...    Windows Media Player 11(WMP11): http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    RealPlayer: http://www.real.com/    And lots of other programs. Keep in mind that DVD copying is illegal especially if distributed for money. If you really want to do this, Rip the files from the DVD to your computer, and burn them to a DVD-R or DVD-RW disc. DVD-RW is better. If you have questions, add me to your contacts and e-mail me; I will answer them the best that I can.

8b94f8ec6f5a2d3d585553dc6eda892caa	Good question . You wont see any difference if you are simply passing an integer by reference and a pointer to an integer.     However if you have taken Data Structure class and if you have learned Binary Trees , you will see that if you pass the root (which points to the first node in the tree ) by pointer  and try to add a new node to the tree there will be no actual change in the tree. However if you pass the root by reference and add a new node to the tree , a new node is added.    In short , when you are passing by pointer you don't change the actual parameter but when you pass it by reference you make changes to the actual parameter.    This is an interview question too. You should explain both cases , like what you observed when you passed an integer an a tree example.      Hope that helps|`|dfjIBHe3aa	In C++?

qVfJBnbOaa	Google Reader does exactly what you're looking for. While it's purely an online tool, Reader gives you the ability to view all of your RSS feeds in one list, or narrow them down by category (your own definitions) or individual site. Reader suggests other feeds that would be interesting to you given your current subscriptions, and also tracks your reading trends. Lastly, you can "star" certain articles in order to save them, or share articles with your friends through RSS feeds that Google creates for you. I even have a feed made from Google Reader that contains all of my starred items, and I have my website display all of these items on the sidebar of my blog. Pretty neat, I'd say.
t5sYXwSqaa	If you are not happy why not try one of the free anti virus programs eg AVG, Avast, Comodo etc. It is worth noting that viruses are been developed all the time which is why the virus definition database in every anti virus program has to be updated periodically. Sometimes a virus is released without the anti virus actually having a cure, which is just bad luck on your part. Having a good anti spyware/adware is also essential. Hope this helps!!!|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's really because antivirus applications are useless. They operate retroactively instead of proactively. Think about it. If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. That's the only way to know all the malware is gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8.

Hard to sum it up in a short answer but I will try.<br>  <br>  We have so many rouge hackers running around either trying to make a name for themselves, working for someone designing viruses allowing these crooks to get their hands on your personal information, or everyone's favorite - "Industrial Espionage".<br>  <br>  Avoiding a new virus can be hard if when you come in contact with it before the anti-virus programmers can write a solution for it and add it to their system of defense. In this way your choice of anti-virus software become critical, if they are slow in putting out the solution or never get around to it because its not a "Popular" enough virus to justify their spending time and money on writing up a defense then you may wish to switch to a more reliable program. <br>  <br>  But remember, before they can fix it, they have to discover it. Therefore if you are one of the first few to be infected, its likely you will not be protected yet.<br>  <br>  And like was said elsewhere, remember that some free antivirus software, or even some pay versions either plant viruses or fake them to make themselves look good by finding viruses nobody else could, when in fact they are the ones responsible!! Remember also that if someone can build a program then there will always be someone who can sabotage it by using that same knowledge. <br>  <br>  I personally use System Mechanic Pro which has a bundled Firewall and Antivirus (I believe they subcontract it out from Kaspersky). But I also use other means as a supplement like "Windows Defender" which is free and from Microsoft who actually created "Windows" in the first place.<br>  <br>  Note: System Mechanic Pro isn't free, but it has a 30 day FREE TRIAL that "Actually Works 100%" not limited a limited trial like most others give you.  If you dont like it, dont keep it, you not out anything...<br>  <br>  If you go with them, make sure you get the "Professional" version it so worth all the utilities! <br>  ----> <a href="http://www.iolo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.iolo.com</a>|`|Jd2LwDOcaa	Beforing answering i need to know how you got your antivirus program, You have Purchased or ou have downloaded the free vertion from the internet.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

Acer seems to be the cheapest computer's on the market that are not total crap and even their cheapest fullsize laptop is just scratching at 400 to 500. If you want it to "game" and I am assuming you mean more then just peddly flash games your looking at around at least 700 to 800 to get bottom of the line. You want to play games like Bioshock, Oblivion, or CoD I would suggest upping your max, searching ebay, or financing.

DjGEJfaPaa	Your machine is infected. Pop-ups are mostly caused by adware, spyware, and other malicious and unwanted software and using pop-up blocker won't help an infected PC. Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.<br>  <br>  Running virus removal programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective. The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a “high” chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, it's safer and better than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free. If you add-on McAfee SiteAdvisor, it will warn you of potentially harmful sites. I also recommend CCleaner which is a free system optimization and privacy tool.|`|g4ubbgmqaa	This is a list of online antivirus scanners Safety.Live.com(that one is Microsoft's)  Symantec.com  Housecall.TrendMicro.com  Comodo.com...Comodo.com offers free manual disinfection and a free security suite from the makers of Comodo Firewall Pro.|`|V0u28xgeaa	Your infected, try MalwareBytes Antimalware ( free )|`|VbP8YWonaa	Are you using IE7 as a web browser?

JustHost has unlimited space, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited mysql databases, unlimited email accounts, and support for almost all file extensions. It is my favorite host...and for only 5 dollars a month. Next on my list would be  monster host...they're a little more popular.

If you are having problem choosing a web hosting to use for a forum, I suggest you do the following:       1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury, hostingsthatsuck.com or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.       2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a X sucks search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.       3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.    Some good hosts to consider are Fatcow, Justhost and Webfaction.    Good luck.

If everyone can do that we might as well just buy one and share it. No offense.    You will need all the registry for it to work, even then I am not sure will it function properly. I have thought about this idea before but never got it working, maybe I just did something wrong. The only thing you can do is save the save files and try to find another disc from a friend and install it.    Good luck.      http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/

NKKiaC3Naa	In most countries, any work you create would be copyright you by default (unless you specifically released it into the public domain or assigned the copyright to another party).|`|DCXk0bVLaa	Read in conjunction with Jimboasa and Holliz.    If I drew a stick figure on a piece of scrap paper I would be the copyright owner.  I would need to register the picture to enable legal action against anyone who copied it.  This is something you must do and you need to find a way of adding a copyright warning on the disks, even if it means re-burning them.  This still won't stop anyone from reproducing your work and then selling copies but if you catch them you can sue.  If it's not legally registered you would have to prove that you did the work and not them.  All music CD's contain a copyright warning but this does not prevent illegal copying.  Another way of making copying more difficult is to add a watermark to the illustrations on the disk.  Again, this is not foolproof. A bit of deft work in Photoshop can negate that.  It's a bit like DRM copy protection on music CD's. It's there but there are ways around it.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Copyright is not simply something you add.  You need to register your work as your own work - otherwise you would have problems suing somebody for copying your work or using it without permission.  http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-re...|`|CKE9oLlZaa	of course - what are they going to do with it - reproduce it?  This is a dumb question. What is the thought process? Does it cost you lots of money?  Anyway, I've worked in printers and the artists there sometimes do things like one guy made a whole range of cards for all different occasions. Putting his name on the back just above the printers' company logo and name gave him exposure.

You are not alone! :-)|`|MJ88TAlkaa	get a myspace.   i have had one for a long time and it in no way has been a popularity contest. nobody in my school even talks about myspace while they're in school.

It's just what you choose to do.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	It is only teens that misuse Facebook/MySpace in the sense of using them either as fake popularity contest or to harass, threaten or insult each other.

My wife, 51 is a professional singer/actress and has to maintain a Facebook presence for professional networking but actually finds MySpace more fun|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I don't have one, so I guess I am weird too.|`|SSvRfxhaaa	no|`|icbRyY6Jaa	yeah facebook=after college  myspace=high school|`|AHCtDhUcaa	not weird what so ever!   you shouldn't care what people think  if you want to keep in touch with people its better to call them or see them in person.    i never really Log on to it. no big deal. and don't worry about it.... theres thousands of other things to do.|`|tJa60S4Taa	No, it is a smart choice, because most people waste a lot of time on Facebook, and make "friends" they don't even know.

Personally, I don't think you need Fackbook for everyday use. I find it better for people who you no longer see in reality. For example, someone in your highschool who you no longer see due to the fact that the person is a far distance away from you.    If you add someone you see everyday, what's the point? Only that you get to see them outside of school.    I don't hate myspace, bebo, facebook or anything but I don't have any of them. It's just that everyone has one, and they take it as a big deal and I don't like that fact.|`|nlXNrAC3aa	No its not weird, you could have my space or Bebo  i don'tt haveface-bookok its not weird.  plus to be honest it just makes you give you information to random people.|`|usYzOU7waa	plenty of people (myself included) don't have facebooks.  It's not because we're weird, it's because humans are lucky enough not to have a variety of interests.  If we didn't, we would never have gotten past the Paleolithic Era.  If you aren't into it, it's because 1. you have better things to do, and 2. you recognize the disadvantages and decide it's not worth it.  It just shows you're smart enough not to blindly follow what everyone else its doing.  So again, you're not weird, you're just the variety that keeps mankind moving.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|g8kIjpwSaa	15 inch Macbook Pro|`|fna0OfuCaa	I just got a dell studio 15 in pink n i loveee it. if i could afford a macbook i woulda got one of those tho!|`|i4rCbS58aa	HP!!!|`|zdO16ELnaa	I GOT MY FIRST LAPTOP ON XMAS I GOT A ACER BUT DON'T GET A LAPTOP WITH NO CD-ROM I GOT ONE DON'T THERE SLOW AND THE WORDS ARE ALL WEIRD A LOT OF STUFF IS F'ED UP|`|cFVY91w3aa	http://www.pcworld.com/article/125647-3/...

Pb8Ny75Oaa	well....pretty good question...mc or pc????    it depends....Mc is absolutely easier to use (that's how i have found it)    it has cool application and programs..if u are in the US or Canada it's easy for to go to an apple store and take a look at the applications by yourself...couple of months ago i decided to buy a MC i watched all videos on youtube but when i went and try them by myself it felt absolutely more interesting and different.    macbooks are lighter, got better operating system (compared to vista) and are perfect for graphic designing, listening to music, making videos and editing photos+ college life. even if u are using programs that only can be run on the pc, u can install xp or vista on the Mac using Bootcamp.     If u are living in Canada the cheapest macbook is around 1200, and if u are in the US, then the price is 1100.     and the new macbook is around 1300-1400    however, there is something called PC. some companies are producing PC laptops which are pretty competitive with Macbook.  like Sony Vaio. it's a cool laptop.    the most strong reason that can prompt u to buy a PC is the directory of its games. there are various games for PC. So , if u are a Pro Gamer u might not like to go with Mac, although the new ones have very strong graphic cards like Geforce256 MB.    again, Mac is stepping into gaming market by adding Geforce graphic cards. Right now there are few games for it, but it seems in the future there would be more.    so again, If u got the money. if u hate Vista. If u do care about not getting virus and spyware easily. If u do care about the style. if u do care about the lightness and pretty cool track pad and keyboard.   if u do care about the performance of ur computer.and a pretty cool Operating System like OSX 10. then go with the Mac.    If u are Hard Core Gamer ...if u are doing a lot of gaming with PC, and if u don't have a lot of money and u want to save a little money besides buying a computer go with the PC. like Dell, HP, Acer, Gateway ....    Right now I'm still using XP and I'm satisfied. However, I want to buy a new laptop and i don't want to waste my money on Vista. and moreover, If i want to do gaming i prefer to go with either PS3 or XBOX which have more games and better gaming quality. So I don't care about it. Moreover I do Photoshoping and graphic designing sometimes . So, I think in couple of months i will go with new Macbook..the one that is around 1200-1300 because i can carry it easily to college or anywhere else and it answers all my demands an needs.     I hope my information have been helpful to u so far.    Good Luck|`|S6K91CF7aa	Get the 2.0 GHZ Macbook Aluminum which will be around $1700 with MS Office Home and Students for Mac and with a case from the Apple website.  If you'll just use it for school work and the other stuff (which I do), then don't upgrade the memory or HDD because laptops generally last for 5or 6 years so why spend extra $ while you can save that to get a newer generation of Macbook if Apple introduces one.

38J8nzhBaa	From the PC-Library (found via Google):  "Error 652 - Error Code 0x28C  Windows Error Message 652: 'ERROR_DRIVER_DATABASE_ERROR'  Unrecognized response from the device.    Description of Error  The Windows error 652 message flashes onscreen when the computer___s modem has a problem establishing an Internet connection. This type of error is also the result of phone lines not properly attached to the modem. If the user has a modem of the external type, Windows error 652 occurs because the modem is connected to the incorrect communication (COM) port. This error may also happen because of serial cable entanglement.    Troubleshooting Error 652  THE PROBLEM  These are the problems associated with Windows error 652: The modem is unusable and connecting to the Internet is impossible. A frequent loss of local network connection may also be attributed to Windows error 652.Errors on your system may be caused by invalid registry entries and outdated or corrupt drivers.    THE SOLUTION  To ensure Windows error 652 will not occur again, the user has to make sure the phone line is attached properly to the modem. If the user has an external modem, the serial cable should be connected to the right communication (COM) port. The user should also check whether the phone lines and modem cables are properly linked to the computer. The modem must be properly installed using the right driver. If the problem persists, the user should contact the modem manufacturer."

vL2Ec50Yaa	I'll look it up... maybe it won't take the processor.    The systems sometime come with different processors.  The specs that I found are these:  Intel  Pentium  dual-core mobile processor  T2310 (1 MB L2 cache, 1.46, 533 MHz FSB)  (your already have a upgraded processor over this one)    Still, this tells me that its a dual core, which I believe is superior to the celeron that you are trying to install.  I would look at the top of the celeron processor and use that information to search on Intel's website to find more information on the chip.  Better yet, you can go to tomshardware.com and verify the true speed of each of the processors that you have.    By the way, did you put thermal compound on the celeron processor?  One of the reasons for a machine to turn on then turn right back off again is that it's overheating.  Not enough thermal compound will cause that to happen and too much thermal compound will cause the computer - not to boot.
9KqcP8mAaa	If I understand your question it seems that you have homework to do on your laptop but as soon as you turn on the laptop you don't want to do your homework?  You're suffering from apathy towards schoolwork.  It happens to the best of us.  There is no magic solution, but from my experience break up what you have to do in reasonable chunks and work from there.  Don't try to tackle it all at once and give yourself a study break in between each chunk.    Good luck!|`|6shzp7zDaa	Slip a DVD in.  There's two hours killed.
a25f83093cd84b80ae9dbc97c372b4c5aa	Yes, you will get an option for Ubuntu and an option for XP. I think it's pretty safe, but I haven't tried it myself. I would suggest that you try the Live CD first and if you like it, have a dual boot between XP and Ubuntu. I have heard of some cases where Wubi does not install correctly. Do not hard reboot (press the power button on your computer) during the installation or at any time for that matter because you could corrupt your Windows partition. If worse comes to worse you can always "uninstall" Ubuntu from Add/Remove Progams in XP. If you use Wubi and like Ubuntu, remove it from Add/Remove Programs in XP and set up a dual boot so that Ubuntu does not rely on Windows. To have a dual boot, see this page without the blah_ at the beginning (I hate error 999):    blah_apcmag.com/how_to_dual_  boot_windows_xp_and_linux_xp_  installed_first.htm?page=1    You will also get standby/hibernate options if you dual boot, but these do not work for all computers. Good luck!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I'd go into boot.ini (make a backup file first) and remove one of the two boot lines (you'll see 2 identical lines 0 every digit will be the same).  Then run Wibi.  You'll get 2 options at boot time, Ubuntu and Windows.    Or you could just run Ubuntu from the CD for a while to see if you like it.  Just put the CD in the drive and restart the computer.

uJBnZWtcaa	You mean like this:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/22020217@N0...    It's easy but you might have to practice a little.    Make sure the Layer Palette is open. Click on Window in the main menu at the top then click on Layer in the drop down.    Open the photo and make a copy. See it's layer in the layer palette? It's labelled "Background" and it's locked. We need an unlocked layer so we can do things to it. The first rule of photo editing is "Do Not Ever Work On the Original Photo" because sometimes we do things to photos that can't be undone. OK Right click on the Background layer and choose "Layer From Background". A copy will appear. Now click on the Background layer and drag it up to the trashcan to close it.    Click on the copy to make sure it's highlighted then click on the half moon icon up above it, scroll down and click on Hue/Saturation. An adjustment layer will appear above the copy and the Hue/Saturation dialog will open in the workspace. Slide the middle slider (Saturation) all the way over to the left. In the workspace the photo now looks black and white but look at the little thumbnail photo in the layer. It's still in color.    Press the letter D on the keyboard to reset the foreground/background colors to black and white. If you want to switch them, press the X. Zoom into the part of the photo you want the color to show on. Over in the layer palette click on the big white rectangle in the Hue/Saturation layer. A thin black border will appear around it showing that it's selected.    Now, click on the Brush Tool in the Toolbar. (Make sure Black is the foreground color) Now, this doesn't make sense, but if you paint over the part you want the color to show on with black, you erase the black and white and the color shows through. If you go outside the lines, just press X and paint with white to undo the mistake. As long as that big white rectangle is selected you can paint with black to show the color and paint with white to make the photo black and white again.    When you're done, File>Save As and give your new, edited photo a different name so you don't overwrite the original photo and you're done.    Have Fun!

Hate to tell you this...but....your best bet is to clear out your downloads folder and start from scratch again.    Delete everything in the folder,then run your game again. If it doesn't crash you know it was some custom content crashing your game. If it still does crash check your specs on your computer to make sure you have above the minimum standards. If that STILL doesn't help then go to their website below and post in their technical BBS and see if any one can help you better!|`|oclvWDzPaa	You dont have enough memorie on your computer consider installing it on another drive or on an usb port|`|ht0v669daa	dunno|`|HOedKyX2aa	Need new graphics card/ more ram?    or if it used to work, probably need to re-install it, i sometimes get that problem at the begining.

g7M1DxFCaa	As it's no longer insured, that option's not available.  I wouldn't take it to Curries either as they're all salesmen and not engineers.  I suggest that if you can't find a friend who can fix it without breaking it more then you should take it to a local repair shop and ask their advice.  Maybe you could post another question with all the details about what it is and what's happened and see if you get any useful info.  The first thing that I'd check is that the power supply is working ok, often the wire breaks inside just next to the plug that goes into the computer.  Get someone to measure it with a multimeter and see if there's power at the plug, just having the light on isn't proof of this.  Without more details though it's not worth guessing.|`|xdF08Uqfaa	the insurance is a load of rubbish mate.if he's still got his original receipt that he got with it,it lasts six years and not a year as most people think.if the computer knackered up itself,and it wasn't him that broke it,he's got a good chance of getting it sorted.go to this address and it will help.Good luck and don't take no for an answer, from curries.....http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk/|`|DP7UUDVXaa	buy a new laptop|`|L6wK75j1aa	he can either do three things  (1) put the insurance back on  (2)find someone he knows who find someone that will fix it cheaply  (3)buy a new laptop|`|IotJ5Y5waa	BE aware that when you take out a new insurance policy you cannot make a claim for the first 2-3 months.|`|Wu46F3h1aa	If the laptop is 2 years old, he's better off buying a new laptop, Laptops have about a 2-4 year lifespan, only people that take really good care of their machines will get more than 2 years out of it.

AA10834300	It's a wireless access point, which is different from a wireless router.    A wireless access point plugs into an existing network router and gives a wireless "tap" into the network.    Businesses usually uses them to plug into their network wall ports and give wireless access in rooms that don't ordinarily have wireless access.    The problem for you is that you'd still need a router to go with it. An access point needs a router or a switch to be able to be of any use.    You'd normally buy a wireless router which has the 'router' part included.    So you've basically got the wireless access point part but not the router part.    You could buy a normal network router and then plug the access point into it, but to be honest I'd just by a wireless router and dispense with the access point or sell it on Ebay.|`|066a3072b2a697635921e0eb4d7507ddaa	The Linksys WET11 Wireless Ethernet Bridge is a device that can be used to share a broadband connection via 802.11b, or simply to link two Ethernet networks together. The growth of the use of 802.11b network technology closely mirrors the march of broadband and many people are wanting to share their broadband connections with other computers in a house, without the problems of hiding network cables under floors or linking different floors together. It should be noted that to make use of the Linksys WET11 you will require an ADSL modem and combined router, i.e. a device to terminate the ADSL line and provide an Ethernet connection suitable for the WET11.     The WET11 is cheaper than a lot of wireless access points (WAPs), simply because it is such a simple device, essentially it will act as a transparent connection to an Ethernet network. This means unlike a lot of traditional WAPs, it does not introduce complications of an additional NAT router, which makes it ideal for people who already have an Ethernet ADSL modem/router. An additional advantage of using separate wireless devices is that the market is changing rapidly and new faster standards are emerging so by using modular devices it is cheaper to upgrade in the future, additionally the small size of the WET11 makes it simple to pick an optimum location for it.     One interesting area is that the Linksys WET11 is able to link the X Box and Playstation 2 games consoles to broadband connections via 802.11b. The WET11 provides a very neat solution to the growing problems that exist in many houses, of how to get the broadband connection to where the games console is used.     The WET11 arrives with a the standard power brick, a quick install guide, CD with configuration software, an antenna, the WET11 itself, and a short 2metre CAT5 cable. This means you have everything to do the initial configuration for the device.     The device has four LEDS, the LAN and WLAN flash to indicate activity, PWR informs you that the device is switched on and the DIAG or diagnostics LED is used for fault indication purposes.     The operational modes of the Linksys WET11   Before using the WET11 it is best to consider the type of configuration you will be using. There are two modes to consider:     Sharing a broadband connection - Ad Hoc mode     This mode is perhaps the most common mode people will be using. This involves linking the Linksys WET11 to an existing ADSL router. The WET11 will then allow computers with their own wireless network cards running to see the adsl router. The WET11 will remain transparent, which means that computers using the wireless will behave as if they had a network cable running to the adsl router, the big advantage of this is that all the computers connected via the wireless and wired networks will be able to see each other. With a great many WAPs they use a NAT router to share the connection, which can result in the wired and wireless networks being separate.       more info at http://www.thinkbroadband.com/hardware/r...
vf5gLYEaaa	you cant upload movies from windows movie maker  beause its an wmv file and youtube doesn' upload that type  my suggestion is download jodix video ipod converter  google it  its free   and convert it  it turns mp4 file  and youtube takes it  i promise you this is your problem  not because of youtube  because of the type of file|`|FTvkahKWaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|cOLbrnLTaa	this used to happen to me ok do this when u save u have to first save to your computer. then u upload it. that is all click on : SAVE TO COMPUTER its under finish movie.|`|Uu4vUvexaa	go to   http://www.speedtest.net/  and look at your upload speed|`|Wg0nwOiiaa	uhhhhhhhh........ good question !!!|`|PraEwTolaa	Okay here are some possibilities:  It's too big and needs to be compressed.  It's small but you have too much in the video - mine does that.  Your computer is too slow.    What you need to do to compressehe file is opening the file back up in windows movie maker and go to save as and when you go to render it or publish it set the quality to a lower setting. It may not be as good but as soon as you get the real promboem solved you can publish it again.  It's frustrating, I know I've been been there, so just try a few more   things. :)|`|DDCN75TCaa	If your trying today that's your problem.    Youtube isn't working right today for some reason, its REALLLLLY slow.
SgQa4zjTaa	Here's a way to do it, but it can be a little different than you're use to.    Select Insert\Object  Select Microsoft Graph Chart and OK    You will have to remake your chart with the Graph Chart object. Making a chart this way is a little different than with the normal chart. For instance, the data has to be in rows and not columns. The data has to be values and not formulas. You could copy the data on the sheet and Paste Special (values and Transpose to rows ) if you need to. Then copy and paste the values to the Chart Object data window. There are other quirks as well, but you should be able to make the chart the way you want.    Because this is an object, you can physically make the chart object large and change the Page Setup settings so that it prints on multiple pages.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	You can just stretch a chart with the boxes on the sides and top and bottom.    I don't know any other way.|`|WZyC9bCjaa	You can do this in you printer's preferences when you print it. All printers have different choices, mine is an HP and I can find the option under the "effects" tab, where I can enter a percentage of the size of the original, if I pick 400%, it will be 4 times as big as the original and print across 4 pages.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Looks like you could use some disk 'house cleaning' for starters;  First, back up your pic's, music & documents to a set of CD's.  Direct copy will be fine, and easy to get back to if needed.  Next, for some immediate space gain, delete all but the most recent Java version & update from 'Add or Remove Programs' (see 'Control Panel'> Add or Remove...)  and see CCleaner settings below.     One disk performance item is to 'compress contents' and 'allow index service'. These help optimize file recovery speed & save disk space.  Start> my computer> right click 'c' drive> properties> general tab: here check both boxes & 'OK'.    Don't freak out: it may say days or more to run, but this time drops dramatically as the process advances.  Just walk away and let 'er run for the duration: it will self close when done.   Depending on the files & sizes, it may take several hours to do (maybe do it at night before bed?).  When done, run 'CCleaner' (http://www.filehippo.com/download_cclean...  & defrag the drive.    Once every 3 months run the 'disk check' which will look for physical problems on  Hard Drive disk sectors.  For XP do this: Start> my computer> right click 'c' drive> properties> tools> error check: here check both boxes, then OK. The next time you cold boot your system, this process will run (maybe 30-60 minutes) fixing disk errors(if any).    Run CCelaner:  To keep a Windows system running at peak efficiency, registry cleaning is one important procedure (among many others).  Download; create a 'Restore Point;  install CCleaner; then:  On the main CC window, the 'paintbrush' tab is for the Windows components that you can clean; (in the 'Advanced' heading, check 'Hotfix uninstallers' to clear these files) & tick the bottom right box (Run Cleaner) an it will delete (or overwrite option) those files.      ***********  Same procedure for the 'applications' tab.    Next, down from the' paintbrush' is the 'Registry' icon (like a Rubik's Cube); first tick 'Scan for issues' button on the bottom; wait for the process to run.  It'll show a long list of entries for the first couple of cleanings; (Back up your first couple of registry cleanings, and if your unit gets ungovernable, restore those files. I've never had to do it, so I can't tell you how. After that the cleanings will be for empty folders or other junk so backup likely won't be necessary).  When ready, tick the 'Fix Selected entries' and CC will take care of those.  For your 1st few uses,  have checked the 'show prompt to back up registry files'; open CC> Options> Advanced> check the 'show prompt...' box; then tick the 'yes' or confirm to back up the registry.  (It gets saved to the 'c' drive, as 'ccxxxxxx')    Find 'CCleaner' here: http://www.ccleaner.com/|`|mE3wNi8Raa	do the disk cleanup and disk defragmenter and also remove files u dont need|`|Nn8V7Akiaa	run disk defragmenter that might clear up some space\  start>programs>accessories> disk defreagmenter     Buy an external hard drive (around $50 can hold 100g of space)    do a giant computer program purge and spend two hours going through all the programs on your comp and deleting all the crap    BTW keep RCT it is awesome :D

Uninstall Firefox from your computer    3. Doing a cold reboot (Actually shutting down the computer, waiting one minute and turning it back on).    4. Using Windows (I'm assuming you use this OS) IE to download the new install file of Firefox and install to your machine.    5. Re-add all of your addons and use Foxmarks to get your bookmarks back!

Then go to hp.com at the link given below and download the drivers for your specific machine.    Compaq and HP are now one and the same  company. You shouldn't need to go to the NVidia site for this driver. Best to get it from your computer manufacturer's site.

vL2Ec50Yaa	I would suggest that you look for a laptop with a core 2 dual processor, or you could go with a core 2 quad like this one...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  This processor has 12mb of L2 cache... that's massive, and 2Ghz on all 4 processors!    When they are talking about 3ghz, they are probably speaking about the P4 3.0 processor.  Since the P4 came out, we go to the dual core, the core2dual, the core2quad, and now the I7 processor.    If you get a core2dual with the fastest speed you can afford with 4Gb of ram, I think you will be happy with its performance  Here is a core2dual T9400(2.53GHz) x 2 - that should do the trick... with 1Tb of hard drive space & 1Gb of video memory.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...     The laptop you have now is probably a P4 2.4    By the way, a laptop with a P4 3.0 is old and will run HOT.  The newer core2duals & quads by Intel run cooler and therefore should last longer.|`|TyKGJwlcaa	Good laptops at 3 ghz are usually gaming laptops.

That was a well-reported bug with legit versions of Office for Mac. Get off your high horse, especially when you don't know what you're talking about.    HOW TO GET THROUGH THIS ISSUE    Some users who have installed Office 2008 for Mac Service Pack 1 are reporting an issue that occurs after installation. The issue causes the Office Setup Assistant to open when they try to open an Office application. This situation occurs when the Office Setup Assistant detects that an invalid Product Key was used to install Office 2008.    To resolve this issue, please move the following files to the Trash:        * /Users/username/Library/Preferences/Micr... 2008/Microsoft Office 2008 settings.plist             * /Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Office/OfficePID.plist          After you complete these steps, open any Office application, and then use the product key that is included with your original installation disk to complete the installation. The product key is located on the back of the Office 2008 for Mac DVD sleeve or on the back of the Install Guide.|`|FLHbflKMaa	lol...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    d                                                                                                                                                    c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        z                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            .

4U9DH6KGaa	You cannot move programmes without uninstalling them and then installing them on the new drive.     Do you have photos and music stored on your c drive?  These are big files and can be moved without any detrimental effect.    Search for this directory:    C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR NAME\My Documents    (double click my computer, then c, then documents and setting etc)    Everything in this folder can be copied and pasted to the new harddrive.  Copy and paste is best, once you can see the files on your new harddrive then you can go back to the c drive and delete them.|`|bb1cb2513da4b77930a90436d3b5e62baa	You can move files that aren't installed to the drive. For example, you can move documents, videos, music, etc. to your D drive. However, you would not be able to move say... Microsoft Word.|`|SxnvW5eoaa	As for programs and games you install yourself (like Office, etc), you have to uninstall and reinstall them, this time specifying the installation folder to be in D.    However some folders can easily be transferred from C: to D: without causing any problems, like the My Documents/Documents folder, the Temp folders, the Pictures and Music folders, and the Temporary Internet Files folder.    You don't just copy the folders straight away. You can right-click on the My Documents folder and select properties and choose a new target location. The temp files can be changed using Control Panel-System-Advance-Environment Variables. The Temporary Internet Files can be moved using Control Panel-Internet Options.    You can also change the location of the page file (pagefile.sys) to D:, using Control Panel-System-Advance.    I'm sorry I can't be more specific, you didn't mention whether you use XP or Vista, the procedures may be slightly different for each, but you get the general idea.    Reminder, don't just cut a folder and paste it in the D: drive. Doing so can make your programs stop working if you don't know what you're doing.

wztiKqF9aa	Online backups are definitely worth it.  While I also recommend keeping local backups, if a thief comes in & steals your PC & external drive, its all lost.  Or if a fire rips through your home, its all lost.    Carbonite has a descent program, but I've found Mozy or Backblaze to be a better solution.

While I recommend using more than one method to backup your most important data, I would highly recommend using an online backup service.    Online backup services usually offer automatic backup, meaning as your files change the service automatically backups your changes. They can be scheduled to run when there are new files needing backed up or files have changed.    Online backup services also protect your files in the case of theft or other perils. A fire can destroy both your computer and backup if there is not a copy off site. Online backup makes it easy to have a copy off site.    All of the online backup services offer encryption. They encrypt your data on your hard drive and then transfer your data over SSL to their data centers.     The most popular online backup services are Carbonite, Mozy and IDrive. I recommend all three. They are very good products to backup home users and small businesses.     You can read more about these services at my website where I review each.

It's not that having more memory or hard drive space means you'll have a better laptop, its about the laptop brand you're buying.|`|UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!
AA10434137	It all depends on what is in each machine.  You pay for memory / drives / software etc.  All you are asking is which case is cheaper!  You get what  you pay for!  A general rule of thumb is the laptop might be cheaper because it has an on-board monitor (but smaller than you would get for a desktop)  Compare all the specs on both machines.

Again no additional power connector needed and even though picture as regular profile it includes low profile bracket. This is just as fast as the 9500gt but with less memory it is recommend for resolutions under 1650x1080. And finally    ASUS Radeon HD 3450 256MB $30 ($20 w/10 mail in rebate)  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    A decent card for casual computer use and light gaming. No gaming at high resolution or high details of course. Great just for internet surfing and maybe a little Sims.     All 3 of these are low profile and do not require an external power connector. All 3 are the best of their price tiers depending on your budget. I have the 8600GT in my case and it runs everything I need it to. Again if you want the best, the 9600GT (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... you'll need a new power supply at least 300w and 26A on the 12v rail. And most likely upgrading the power supply would require switching to a full size case due to manufacturers not making many slim style power supplys.
0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Vertical lines can be cause by 2 parts going bad in your laptop. The grafix card or the LCD screen, this is easy to test as to which one it is. You will need a desk top computer to test the grafix card for the laptop, just barrow the monitor from the desk top & plug it in to the VGA port on your laptop. The signal should switch automatically to the desk top monitor, if the vertical lines are gone then you will know the problem is with the LCD screen if the lines are still present then the problem is with your graphics card... This is not something that the avrage user can replace, it is part of the main board on a laptop.    If the lines are still there on the external monitor the grafix card will need to be replaced, but on a laptop computer this means replacing the intire motherboard. And with the age of your laptop you would be better off spending $100 more & buying a new laptop, as the repair would cost over $475...    Now if the lines are not present on the external monitor, then this is a fairly inexpenive fix. If you or a friend are good with a screw driver & have an hour to spare. The LCD screen will cost around $135 + ship, If you took it to a repair shop & had it done they would charge $325-$350 for this...    Order the LCD screen here  http://www.screencountry.com/  Great Company I use them all the time!    Here is a how to replace the screen. Step By Step!  http://www.screencountry.com/index.php?s...

zorYTX59aa	Before YouTube did their super makeover last year, there was a cool  feature that actually let you view THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF EVERY   SINGLE VIDEO-COMMENT you ever made.    Not only that, what I call the "View All" superpages also showed you:  -- the full title of every video you ever commented on;  -- direct photo thumbnail links to each of the videos;  -- users' thumbs scores (+/-) of all of your comments;  -- how long ago each comment of yours was posted;  -- the actual text of all your comments in their entirety.    Sadly, YouTube has taken this away, but there might be some good   news: I've organized a small clandestine group of YouTubers and we  are trying to come up with a solution, fix or "work-around".    If you are interested and want to know more (or maybe even become   part of my group and email list), please click my avatar and send me   an email. Better yet, send me a note via my YouTube profile page at    http://youtube.com/inukjuak89    For the time being, if you are truly desperate to find some of your old   video comments, and if you can remember a short phrase which you   wrote, just Google those words within quotation marks. For example,   to find an old video comment which I wrote in January last year, I just   have to type into the Google searchbox: "563 tons at takeoff". Check   out my theory by typing: "563 tons at takeoff" yourself, and then look   for my comment from "1 year ago"; you will be surprised. Or you can  click on the link below:    www . google . ca / search ? hl = en & q = %22 563 + tons + at + takeoff %22 & meta=  http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=%225...    Remember to use Google's searchbox, not YouTube's.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Before you do anything, back up your drivers to a separate CD!  It gets harder and harder to find them, and many places charge to get them.  Try Driver Magician Lite (freeware);  http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system...  Use the 'identify & back up all drivers' for the first BU; & keep it with your unit.    Data back-ups are separate items from System backups;  Data are things you have created or added to you unit with programs: letters, documents, pictures, music, etc.  These should be done every other week or 1X per month.    Windows has a backup built in (System Tools> Backup), but I find it bulky & hard to use.  Your 1st backup should be the 'all' data option as a baseline; after that use the 'incremental', which saves only new items, and changes to originals.  This saves space on you backup media.  Ideally 2 copies are made of each backup: one kept with the unit, one kept 'off site' in case of fire, storms, etc.  One decent B.U. application is 'Cobain' (moderately easy to use; freeware).  http://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/software....    For an entire drive back-up (programs, data, drives, settings, etc.) try  DriveImage XML   enables you create a complete backup image of any logical drive or partition, allowing to to restore your entire operating system along with installed programs, user settings, registry and all. You can restore the image later to the same or a different drive, and also choose to copy the drive directly to another one. The program includes an image explorer that lets you open previously created backup images and extract individual files. DriveImage XML can use volume locking or Volume Shadow Services (VSS) to create the backup image from within Windows, without the need to reboot. The program stores your images in .dat files, using XML format, allowing you to process them with 3rd party applications.  Freeware.  http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/system...

You are better using vnc for local connections. this is fully controllable, as you can turn off the server when not required and only needs the port 5800 open for a browser control, or 5900 for the vnc client connection. For access across the internet nothing is so easy as the requirement for router port forwarding, plus opening machine firewalls to the internet, coupled with dynamic public IP addresses multiplies the complexity by hundreds.

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied comes to tens of thousands   of channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, at least 800 subscribers   and 25 videos, or maybe 400 subs and 50 vids. Some institutions with special  videos have become "partners" with somewhat less - like Concordia University.  http://youtube.com/user/ConcordiaUni    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video   -- your channel-page video on "autoplay" ?  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and which features only your own videos.    If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page,   click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    I hope you find all my information helpful.

The Apple "air" has a program that lets you access the CD drive on a remote computer through your network|`|wpeInOLzaa	I would really stay away from the "netbooks" unless you have a very specific need for ultra small size over functionality. With a netbook you usually get a VERY small hard drive which is usually between 8-64 GB whereas the standard is closer to 200-300 GB in notebooks. Also, you will only get 1 GB of ram, keep in mind windows 64 bit now supports up to 16 GIG in a regular laptop so you're really putting yourself in a potion where you have limited upgrade-ability there too. Another thing to consider is the lack of an "optical drive" in a netbook commonly known as a dvd/cd drive, this means you will not be able to install software unless you purchase it over the internet. (But remember you have a VERY small hard drive, so you're not going to be able to install many programs) Meanwhile your stuck with the far inferior "Atom" processor, which is the "brains" of your computer. Look for a good deal and you will be able to find a fully functional computer (laptop) for around $600 that will serve you for years. Also, if you're dead set on a netbook, check USER reviews for specific netbooks you're looking at on different electronic web sites like best buy.com, amazon, qvc.com ect. Many of the people who bought these netbooks are unhappy for one reason or another after they get it home and realize how small the screen is and how slow the processor is. I beleive, however, that HP is viewed as the best netbook over the Acer's, EEE's, and the others.

WmK8svvnaa	Im not sure if this works for an iPhone, but 1stly u can get a program called PodUtil which takes all media off your iPod, or you can connect ur iPhone to the computer and in folder options enable showing hidden folders. then got to ipod_control and then click on music and ALL of your media files will be there. Drag them out to a folder, like 'my music' then drag to itunes, and when you sync all the folders will be sorted and renamed - because all the folders names before are like 'F01'.
7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	http://www.microcenter.com/  If you have one near you, go in and talk to someone on the floor.  (If you want to see REAL geeks, not the "squad" type, that's where you'll find them.  Their people love to talk computers - and they actually know what they're talking about.)    A 4GB drive (http://www.microcenter.com/single_produc... ) will cost you $8 - I have the 8GB version of that one, and never leave home without it - and it'll be more than enough for what you need.  (A 2GB will be just a tiny bit too small.)

4ZwGu3hyaa	Well to make your own website you need to use the most advance program in the history of computers; notepad (gasp; no, no, anything but notepad). Unfortunately, it one of the most expensive programs in the world, $0.00 (OMG; how am I suppose to afford that?); and it's almost impossible to find. Luckily for you I'm here and I'll tell you were it is, ON YOUR COMPUTER!    Basically, you don't need anything but the built in, handy-dandy, notepad to build your own website. You, obviously, don't know how to write code which is what creates a website. You can see what I'm talking about if you go to "view/source" in your browser. Yes, all of those letters and symbols mean something and you can learn it to from here...    http://www.w3schools.com/    I just finished making my homepage of my site using nothing but notepad. It looks great, and I didn't need anything but knowledge. If you want you can get notepad++ which colors the code (trust me that makes the difference when looking at your code). Of course once you've finished you need to pay for a domain name, but to make a website you don't need to pay or download anything!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You can do it completely free:  you can run your own server (and use a free subdomain name) - http://webdingers.endoftheinternet.org/a... - and you can learn to create the site - http://www.w3schools.com/ http://www.tizag.com/ and many others.|`|Vcte2eUtaa	Very short answer: have a look here: http://webdesign.coolstart.nl/  It will give you some orientation and ideas.      regarding another answer: Freewebs / Webs call themselves a 'free' websitemaker/host but actually they spoil your website with a real ugly banner right at the top. When you upgrade to 'pro' they remove the banner, but then better go for http://www.one.com for sure, they offer really much more for much less.

If the object is a circle, you might want to use the circle "marquee" tool but the polygonal lasso usually works well.    Go up to "Select" and choose "Inverse" from the drop-down menu.    Go up to "Image" and drop down the menu. Select "Adjustments" and then "Hue/Saturation." Move the saturation slider (the middle one) all the way to the left.    Do a Control-D to remove the selection boxes and you have your image.|`|fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	If you find the Sponge tool (same button as Dodge or Burn - rightclick to find it), pick a size and a Hardness.

I have photoshop, but I am not sure if this is the correct way to do it. But this is how I do it.     So first of all, open up your picture from FILE > OPEN and select a picture. Now, click the POLYGONAL LASSO TOOL. This might be hard to find. So on the left side, there are a bunch of tools, right? I don't know if this is the same, cause I have photoshop cs3 extended, so it would be the 3rd tool from the top. You might have to click the drop down list to find it. After you have that, you click where you want to start the black and white part, trace around the object, its polygonal, so you can click a little at a time. After you have traced completely around the object, then it will have dotted lines around it, and then you click at the top IMAGE > ADJUSTMENTS > BLACK AND WHITE. And there you have it! I know this is not very clear, and I don't know how to post pictures on here, so if you can give me your email adress, I can attach screenshots on how you can do that. :) I hope I helped!

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied comes to tens of thousands   of channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, at least 800 subscribers   and 25 videos, or maybe 400 subs and 50 vids. Some institutions with special  videos have become "partners" with somewhat less - like Concordia University.  http://youtube.com/user/ConcordiaUni    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video ?  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and which features only your own videos.

If it says invalid operating system disk, that means that either your computer is not reading the disk properly, or it is not a real Windows XP disc. Does the disc have a hologram on the front? Does it say something other that Windows XP on the cover (i.e. Recovery)?    Another possibility is that it's not reading from the right drive. Does your CD drive's light flash on right before that message comes?|`|4da56cc54676c9805b7acd28946de21eaa	You need to get hold of E-Machines tech support and find out if your PC will even run XP.    Most PC's these days that come with Vista CAN NOT be downgraded to XP even if you blow Vista away using DBAN or Killdisk.    The PC's are set up so that they will only accept Vista!!!!!    I know this really sucks but it's a fact.  And.... don't get conned into trying to use nLite to accomplish it because it ain't gonna happen that way either.    I recently spent 50 hours attempting to downgrade a Gateway to XP and this past week attempted to downgrade an HP to XP.  They simply won't allow it.  I even flashed the bios on the HP with a Dec 08 version of the BIOS that was for XP and Vista and still no luck.    I wish you well, but I don't think you'll be successful.    I can however recommend that you go to the http://techrepublic.com.com/ web site and searc on an article that is titled:  Transform Windows Vista into Windows VXP -- the hybrid    That article will allow you to make Vista function very much like XP and will remove all the usless crap from Vista.  It's not a true copy of XP but it's a lot better than Vista is as they deliver it.    Good luck and I hope this helps.

You just have to open your router's setup panel.  To do this, plug your computer into your router with an ethernet cord.  Next, open a web browser, and input your router's IP address into the address bar.  It should be "http://192.168.something.something"  To find out the somethings, either check your router's users manual, or if you lost it, get the model number of your laptop, and check with the manufacturer's web site to see what the default is, or if you set it yourself then remember it. (You probably didn't change it yourself as if you did you would have to know all of this.)  The settings panel will look just like a web page with not too great graphics most likely.  Somewhere on there is an option to set a password or a security key.  Exactly where on the page this is located will depend on your router's manufacturer.  Either way, set a key and then remember it so that you can enter it when you connect to your network.  If you are interested in better wireless internet, without worries about someone stealing it, check out WiMax from Clear.  It is superfast wireless, and isn't too pricey.  Unfortunately, it is only in Portland, Oregon at the moment, but it will be in other cities soon.

Free (it's website is advertising supported), and unlike Limewire, Spiralfrog is both legal and virus free. No nasty infections and no potentially huge lawsuits for stealing copyrighted material.  http://www.spiralfrog.com/|`|YIW1KIi6aa	www.songs.pk  www.mp3hungama.com  www.funmaza.com|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|egSM3gWfaa	you could try  mp3gle.com   dilandau.com  seekasong.com  mp3int.com    'mp3int.com' is a good one but u dont always get the song u want.     hope this helps|`|AA11121249	you can use "ARES" is much faster and has more search results.    just google it.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down some of their   servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time.   That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios:   bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few   hours or by the next day.    If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet   files" and RAM (often times called "cache") are brimming to   the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result   being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to   a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way;   or C) never even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in   a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them -- or "clear your   cache" of "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history".  Then reboot.    Note 1: if you have Google Web Accelerator (or something  similar to it), dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   -- do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible.   Not only does it conflict with and ruin YouTube, clicking on   "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.    Note 2: a peculiar fix that once worked for me was altering   the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|AA11629848	There's nothing wrong with YouTube, go back to watch my videos!!|`|tRMgbldcaa	I don't know, the pages seem fine to me but my sound is messed up watching the videos.    o.0|`|LX375VBbaa	It might be a glitch.

WmGcN14laa	I just reread your question and it seems you know the basics of Java.  Maybe you're looking for a strategy pattern.    Check out the article in wikipedia.  It's described there better than I could do.     "The strategy pattern is useful for situations where it is necessary to dynamically swap the algorithms used in an application. The strategy pattern is intended to provide a means to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. The strategy pattern lets the algorithms vary independently from clients that use them."|`|WS95be3Raa	Java is not C++, it doesn't support passing of functions.|`|reCscsu6aa	sharing variables between methods in a class you use the phrase private.    ex:  public class CLASSNAME  {  private int variable;  //private lets you share variables with all methods!!    public void methodname  {  // can use variable in here.  }  public int methodname  {  // and here.  return variable;  }  }    Hope that answers your question.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|7igxiGrAaa	Here is a comparison from Nextag:  http://www.nextag.com/serv/main/buyer/Pr...    Specs on the Lenovo:      * 1.6GHz N270 Intel Atom Processor      * 1GB PC2-5300 DDR2 SDRAM 667MHz      * 10.2" WSVGA AntiGlare TFT with integrated camera 1024x600      * 160GB 5400rpm hard drive      * Intel GMA 950 Integrated Graphics      * Wi-Fi wireless and Bluetooth      * 3-Cell Li-ion battery      * Size: 9.8" x 7.2" x 1.2" (including feet)      * Weight: 2.64 lbs (with 3-cell battery)    Specs on the Acer:      * Screen: 8.9 at a 1024600 resolution, with LED backlit      * CPU: Intel Atom at 1.6GHz      * Solid State Drive: 8GB      * RAM: 512MB DDR2      * Connectivity: Ethernet, Wifi 802.11B/G      * Operating System: Linpus GNU/Linux      * Weight: About 2 pounds, or 900gr      * Dimensions: 9.8x 6.7x 1.14        Specs on the Asus:  Featuring the 900 series' body size (the same as the smaller 7" model), a 8.9" LED backlit screen with a resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels, and a 1.6GHz atom processor, the 900HA comes with a cheaper and more reasonable 160GB 4200rpm hard disk, 1GB of DDR2 memory, standard wireless (B/G),  and a 4 cell battery.     Specs on the MSI Wind:  CPU speed 1600 Mhz  OS Linux  Display Size  10" 1024 X 600  RAM 1024 MB  Hard Disk 80 GB  Battery capacity 24 (Wh)  Weight 1200g  Size (w/h/d mm) 260/180/31 mm    So that being said:  Processor: Same for all, no better or worse on any  Memory (RAM): All 1GB except the Acer. Acer worst for this category. They make laptops with much better RAM (many now can hold up to 4GB)  Hard Disk Space: Lenovo and Asus are best  Display Size: Lenovo or MSI Wind  Battery: Asus  Connectivity: Lenovo    I've only highlighted certian aspects, but the Lenovo and Asus seem the best. The Acer fails in comparison to the capabilities of the others. If I had to pick between the four, I would get the Lenovo.   They make far better laptops than these four, but I'm guessing you're working on a budget?  I have an HP Pavillion dv9700. The specs on it are 1.9 GHz processor, 3GB RAM (just upgraded from 1GB), 130+ GB Hard Disk Space, 4 cell battery.

AA11434633	Unfortunately, dear lady, it's telling you that you need to buy a new, more powerful, graphics card.    This may not prove as simple as it sounds as you must first determine what type of socket the motherboard of your son's computer has.  If it's a laptop, I'd give up now.  Generally, these are not intended to be upgraded.    If you edit your question with details of who the manufacturer of your son's computer is, and which model the computer is, someone will look up the details to see which slots are available on the motherboard.|`|1f944e23d84bc1ff43ee93ad66a40f2eaa	It means you need a better computer- either upgrade the one you have or buy a new one.|`|VsJ1LwUdaa	well, i believe the problem is what they said, but you could try going to NVIDIA.com and doing a scan of your computer, and seeing if it detects that there may need to be software downloaded, dont worry, cuz its free.

My IE8 started coming up with messages about a corruption in finding the default search provider after I downloaded that update you mentioned. I did a system restore to a few days previously to see if this got rid of that error. After I did this IE8 crashed when I tried to open it and froze up like yours. When I tried to uninstall I got the same thing. Missing files. So I undid the system restore. After I did this I could uninstall IE8 no problem back to IE7.     So if you're trying to uninstall after you did the restore back to before the update go back to after the update and try again.

hyzP0uJWaa	Many professional web developers are out there to help you do just this kind of thing. I've never used one, so I don't know how pricey they can get.    You could also look into what is called a Blog. Many web hosts offer blogging software, like word press as part of there hosting packages, I know Brinkster does. (A web host is what you need to get your pages on the internet).    Or, if you have time, you can learn HTML, javaScript, and PHP, and it won't cost you anything but time. There are a million web sites dedicated to teaching these languages, some are easier to follow than others.    The expense will only come in after you've finished your site and it is ready for the web. You'll need to get a web host at that time, which ranges any where from $4 per month to $20 per month.    However, you can start making your Web pages without a Web host, or expensive software like Dreamweaver--Dreamweaver just makes it ALOT easier. This means creating Web pages cost nothing!    You only need a Web host when you are ready for the world to view your Web pages. But you have to create them first!    To create Web pages, you need to know the language of the Web: XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. And that cost nothing. You can create a Web page in as little as two seconds at no cost in Notepad. And the best part is, knowing XHTML gives you full creative freedom over designing your web page: You aren't stuck with the limitations of a template. Besides, you still need to know XHTML even for Dreamweaver CS3 so you won't get lost if you ever need to edit your code directly.    For now, get an XHTML document started. Open up Notepad, Word, or Dreamweaver CS3. Paste this into a blank document :              Untitled Document              All of the content you want viewed must be placed within the body element of the document; meaning, between the  and tags.    You can learn how to create paragraphs here:  http://startwebdev.com/webdevX/XHTML/XHT...    Learn to create line breaks here:  http://startwebdev.com/webdevX/XHTML/XHT...

Here is a whole list of block level elements you can create:  http://www.missingmethods.com/Programing...    And a whole list of inline elements you can create:  http://www.missingmethods.com/Programing...    After you've created your first web page (XHTML document), you'll want to preview it in a web browser (Firefox or Internet Explorer).    To do this, save the XHTML document under "My Documents" in a folder called firstWebSite.    Name the XHTML document firstPage.html (or name it anything you want with the .html attached to the end).    Go to your browser menu and choose File > Open and find firstPage.html.    (These steps are animated here:http://startwebdev.com/webdevX/XHTML/XHT...    If you want the world to view your web pages, you'll need to get a web host.

0F878pKbaa	1. This is not correct. You can create as many objects of a given union as you wish:    union mix_number  {     int i;     int j;  } mix1, mix2, mix3;    2. It's struct, not strict but I believe it's a typo.  3. Yes.  4. Yes  5. Not correct. A pointer to an union points to each of its members, since they share the same memory.  6. Not correct.    The key to understanding an union is to understand that each of the members of an union shares is located at the same memory so they are in fact the same objects but with different (probably) types. If you take mix_numbers union from pt 1, you can refer to the same variable by i or j:    mix_number x;  x.i = 7; // i = 7 and j = 7 as well because they are the same  x.j = 2; // i = 2 and j = 2    Actually, (&(x.i) == &(x.j)) is true.    Whereas a struct is just a set of data bound together. So in struct mix_number ( int i; int j; } you actually have two members: i and j which are two different places in memory.

If you are interested in inventing your  own ASCII username, check out this  website. (Youtube does not allow for  "doublespaces", so I'm not sure that   you would be able to paste it in your   YouTube profile "as is".)    All you have to do is type your name  or any word. In the box that is called   "Font", just click on the fourth option   "_all fonts with your text_" and enjoy  the magic that will appear just below:    www . network - science . de / ascii /  http://www.network-science.de/ascii/

7igxiGrAaa	Laptops and PCs have really come a long way and you can find a great laptop with the capacity you need for what she will be doing, especially with a budget as lenient as yours.  The 2008 average for a mainstream 15-inch laptop is probably close to a 2-2.5GHz dual core processor, 2 GB of RAM and a few hundred gigs of hard drive space. You can find ones with 4GB as well, or even buy the extra memory separate and install it. I just upgraded my memory and it was quite easy.  Here's a link to some top rated laptop: http://reviews.cnet.com/best-laptops/  and PCs: http://reviews.cnet.com/best-desktops/|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you can still find a Gateway P7811FX (call them and beg), it will more than do the job, and leave you about half your budget.  Even a P6860FX would be enough.  (And they're both solid laptops - I beat on mine 24/7.)|`|cILeS32iaa	Your desktop right now will be able to handle the job but barely I think.    Better get at least a dual core processor, some more ram, and maybe even go 64bit computing since right now 32 bit computing can't go above 4gb.    I would suggest getting a desktop instead of a laptop for 3D rendering. In this industry people usually use Nvidia Quadro graphic card but I could be wrong.    Good luck.      http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|LKwYiNeVaa	More RAM that better and bigger Monitor.    If is just for drawings.

EI9ZUsoQaa	As you mentioned, free proxies basically do not work.  There is no free solution to getting a proxy for Craigslist.  You will have to pay.  You probably don't want to hear that but it is the truth.  Craiglsist know what to look for when detecting proxies, and free proxies do not mask themselves and anyone can examine the IP and detect that it is coming from a proxy.  This is what Craigslist does and that is why 99.9% of free proxies won't work.  The best solution is to setup your own proxy.  The IPs will be completely undetectable and you can get them from any country you want (need IPs from the US?  Setup your proxy in the US.  Need IPs from the UK?  Set it up in the UK).  Setting up your own proxy is much easier and cheaper than you probably think, but if you are serious about posting on CL this is the only option you should consider.|`|SzzfrJHxaa	You can give this proxy a try to unblock those blocked websites; it works like a charm!    http://surfez.info    Be sure to tell your friends about it so they too can enjoy.

wrPDCT0Daa	There's nothing wrong with that site in IE or FireFox. I've checked.    What browser are you using? You should always check how a website looks in different browsers. It could be that your browser is old or just can't read the HTML or whatever other code you use for your website.    Everything in the source code looks fine to me.|`|CB15kchkaa	It looks fine in both internet explorer and firefox. I just checked your css and that looks fine too. I think it was a momentary glitch.

Open both images in Photoshop    2. Pick the smaller image and hit ctrl + a to select all of it, than ctrl + c to copy it.     3. Select the other image and hit ctrl + v to paste the first image on top of the second one.     4. Look at the layers menu on the right, if it's not open goto Windows > Layers to open it.    5. Each image should be on it's own layer, select the top image in the layers menu. At the top of the layers menu is a drop down tab that says normal. Pick different option in there to see how it affects your images. You can also play with the opacity on the top layer.    6. You can also erase just parts of layers if you like. The best way to do it is to select the layer in the layers menu, then hit the tiny button that is a dark box with a light circle in it to create a layer mask. Then click on the layer mask and use black white and grey brushes to show or hide parts of that layer. This way you aren't permanently deleting anything  on that layer.    Hope this gets you started, good luck!

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	*DO NOT* format your hard drive!!!    You'll lose everything on it, including Windows.  You'll turn your computer into a brick!    You can't turn the clock back as far as downloads go, only as far as the Windows registry goes.  If you mean a virus scan, ALWAYS scan the entire computer (set it to start the scan after you go to sleep - it'll usually be done by morning.  And, yes, you have to leave the computer on - which won't harm a thing.  TURNING it on is what causes components to fail.  (The only time this laptop isn't running is when I'm traveling with it.  I've had computers - desktops and laptops - running 24/7 for years without a problem.  Just blow the dust out once in a while.)

vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,    Two possibilities.    One, all the CDs you have used so far do not have an autorun file on them.    That is not that likely, so second possibility seems more likely.    Autorun is not yet configured to run on your computer.  This is often the case as it forces user to manually open files, thus enhancing the chance they'll notice a virus prior to running it.    However, if you wish to use autorun then do the following.    1.  Press Windows key and E key together     2.  Right click on your ROM drive and select Properties.    3.

It was cheap as they sell ex repaired laptops or ex display models & they used to sell repossessed ones but unsure if they still do (can get good deals on repossessions as legally they can only charge you what's owing on the laptop at the time they repossessed - meaning you could pay $500 for a laptop worth $2k).  I paid $1200 for an ex display model but it was worth about $2k & the $1200 included accessories as well.

GameRanger is a multiplayer online gaming service supporting over 500 games (including Age of Empires) that lets you play online in a friendly community without the hassles of network connection problems.    Give it a try, it will solve your problems!|`|AA10016890	If you have an IP address that looks like    192.168.x.x (most likely)    or     10.x.x.x    It means you have an IP address that is not routable on the internet. It is being used by your router (or wireless access point, etc.) as a purely private network. If you want to be able to be "seen" on the internet you need to tell your router to forward traffic on whatever port that GameSpy uses to that same port on your computer. The only thing that any computer out on the internet can "see" is your router, you need to tell it to forward certain types of traffic to your computer.

One of the issues being that it threads itself very deep into you system on installation and is hard to remove.  Another problem is that for some reason it frequently will "break down" and stop running.    The easiest way to solve the issue is to reinstall and the re-install the entire Norton system.  You may need to go to http://www.symantec.com to get a removal tool to get it completely out of your system.  Once complete, re-install the entire Norton 360, and then run all updates and then scans.  One of the big problems may be your registry is damaged.

dkpIjt5jaa	MP3 (MPeg - 1 audio layer 3) is a common audio format and one of the standard encoding for the transfer and playback of music on digital audio players. .    In MP3, the use of a lossy compression algorithm greatly reduces the amount of data required to represent the audio recording, in this it is relatively similar to the principles used by JPEG.|`|2ubfofmHaa	mp3 is a type of  file format, it is used for multi-media  (pic, music, video).|`|1CLazt8Taa	An MP3 is the audio format.

There are other formats that do this better, but most digital music is MP3 because almost all computers and media players are capable of playing MP3 music.    It is also used for video, but such videos usually show up on your computer as .avi files instead of .mp3 files, to indicate that they contain video as well as audio.

wUqeZl3Saa	I learned the basics of sign language from a book several years ago. That book is called The Joy Of Signing. It is a very good book for learning ASL. You may want this as a study aid and reference. It may also be out of print for as long as I've owned the book.    The version used in the United States is called American Sign Language or ASL..    I simply entered "American Sign Language tutorial" in Google search and found at least one free one. They also offer credit for learning ASL if you pay the fee. Probably a certificate of completion.    Goto: http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/    Good luck. ASL isn't all that difficult if it is explained properly and it is even somewhat intuitive when you know the background behind the meaning.    Shadow Wolf|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you really want to learn, there are a few ways:    If there's a school for the deaf in your area, they usually give ASL classes.  (My daughter learned to sign when she was 9 that way - she went for 3 years and made some nice friends, some hearing, some deaf.  She's hearing.)    Check with your school - there may be a school that has a concentration of deaf students.  Ask at that school if you can be introduced to some because you's like to learn ASL.  Learning by talking to kids your own age is fun, and you could make a life-long friend or two.    Ask a librarian - they love to help people find things out - they're living search engines.  And your library might have some good tutorial books.

Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Stay away from AVG free ( I have found it more defective than helpful ), it may be free but it has hiccups like the two errors that made the news recently on CNET, the first time it said that Zone Alarm (a firewall) was a virus and the second time, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose their Windows system (they had to issue apologies publicly for this one).    Avast is better but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you just need to add a Virus scanner, use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).    If you just need a Firewall then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender. The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS, which includes the leak test protection, disabled. Use it with Virus scanner disabled (chosen while installing).    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, use the already mentioned Comodo product in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner soes not include one) but have at least one of each (for security). There is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.      Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|tOCESHLYaa	The Best Anti-Virus program. That question is asked at least 10 times a day and youll get a bunch of different answers. There is no best Anti-virus program. There are several very good ones. All of these have high detection and good removal rates. avast! Professional Edition, Avira AntiVir Premium, Norton 2009. Not far behind these leaders is Nod32 AVG paid version, and Kaspersky. You would have good protection if you picked any one of these. Its important to find one that runs good on your computer and doesnt have any conflicts with programs or setting on your computer. All of them offer a free trial.  Free Anti-Virus software is also good. But the list is a lot shorter. Only Avast and Avira offer good free protection. Avira free does not offer anti-spyware protection which is no big deal since most users add an anti-spyware program anyway. Some users will tell you that the free programs offer protection that is as good or better than the paid version. They will even give you links to Virus Bulletin tests, AV comparatives tests. The links are useless since neither of these sites test the free versions. The results you see are for the paid versions. How can Avast or Avira sell an anti-virus program if their free version are just as good. AVG free was good 3 years ago but is really lacking. You only have to go to AVG web site where they state the free version is only basic protection. It does not have anti-rootkit protection. Just to name one of things it is missing. If you want top detection go with Norton, Avast Pro, or Avira Premium. If you want good free try Avast or Avira. Good luck with your new Anti-virus program.|`|NZxvybYUaa	Anti-virus alone won't do. You need protection from spyware, adware, keyloggers, rootkits, and a good dose of common sense, which it sounds like you have. I use Norton Internet Security, Spybot Search & Destroy:   http://www.safer-networking.org  SpywareBlaster, SpywareGuard:  http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/products...    WinPatrol: http://www.winpatrol.com   and keep a copy of HijackThis:    http://majorgeeks.com/download3155.html   handy just in case. I also use a router with NAT and SPI enabled. I have Microsoft Update set to automatic update, and update these programs regularly. One other thing I use is a custom HOSTS file, which you can get here:   http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.ht...  Don't let the 2002 fool you, it's up to date. Read the instructions for your OS to install it. All the software is free except Norton. A decent router can be had for $40-50.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment.

xV5fkgsvaa	Since the setup work for 4 months as you said, try resetting the router and reconfiguing it, it that doesn't work, Upgrade the firmware.     Also, check if there are wireless interference around that might be causing the problem. And if does interference operates the same frequency as of the router (like a 2.4Ghz), then relocate those devices.    Try changing channels on your router as well.

8nLuyDmPaa	Here's the thing.  Since the drive C:\ is your boot volume, you can only extend it into empty space on the same drive.    If it was not your boot drive, such as if you wanted to extend a drive that just has data on it such as pictures, you could extend that onto another drive.    "For logical drives, boot, or system volumes, you can extend the volume only into contiguous space and only if the disk can be upgraded to a dynamic disk. For other volumes, you can extend the volume into noncontiguous space, but you will be prompted to convert the disk to dynamic."

vK53Hh8naa	You can just take a look at their CSS.<br>  <br>  I ran into a problem like this a few weeks ago while working on another website. I found a style that did the trick but it did have some conflicts with older browsers i.e. IE6, due to the way they reference the body element.<br>  <br>  Anyways, this worked for me...<br>  <br>  #theDiv {<br>  position:absolute;<br>  z-index:1;<br>  width: 100%;<br>  right: 0px;<br>  bottom: 0px;<br>  }<br>  body > div#theDiv {<br>  position: fixed;<br>  }<br>  <br>  AS FOR YOUR ADDITIONAL DETAILS:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::...<br>  <br>  If its floating, you might have margins and or padding on the body and or div. Or maybe a border. If you don't need padding or margins, just clear them out to make sure its not inherited. And if you have borders, either clear them or define them so that the bottom is not included.<br>  <br>  #theDiv{<br>  padding:0px;<br>  margin:0px;<br>  border-bottom:none;<br>  }<br>  body {<br>  padding:0px;<br>  margin:0px;<br>  }<br>  <br>  That might do the trick.|`|WCKbJwd0aa	extraDiv2 {<br>   background-image: url(bottom.png);<br>   background-repeat: no-repeat;<br>   background-position: center;<br>   height: 200px;<br>   width: 100%;<br>   position: fixed;<br>   bottom: 0px;<br>   z-index: 5;<br>  }<br>  This is the CSS he used for that area.<br>  <br>  So I'm guessing by putting position: fixed it should fixate the image. And by having it be a div you should be able to simply add this type of coding<br>  <div id="extraDiv2"><span></span></div><br>  <br>  somewhere at the bottom of your html file.

NVidia's hardware is fairly stable but more expensive, but the kicker is the BSODs their drivers cause.  NVidia drivers are continually sloppily written.  NVidia, though, usually has the latest and greatest.<br>  <br>  ATI, on the other hand, has better written drivers but the hardware is cheaper.  Not quite as high quality.  BUT, for the same price, you can pick up a better performing ATI card.<br>  <br>  I own a single ATI Radeon HD 4870.  It handles everything but Crysis smoothly at maximum settings (Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, etc. all run smoothly at maximum settings @ desktop resolution on Windows Vista).  I'm not a huge WWII-remake game fan but Call of Duty 4 should be in roughly the same level of system requirements as Bioshock.  The 4870 should handle CoD 4 just fine.<br>  <br>  The comparable NVidia card to my ATI card is the GTX 260.<br>  <br>  Crossfire/SLI are overrated, IMO.  You pay for two cards but only get a 33% increase in performance.<br>  <br>  I see NVidia has released some newer cards.  The GTX 285 and GTX 295.  I don't know how fast they are but they are going to be really expensive until ATI catches up (ATI is typically lagging).|`|I51RUYZraa	The game has fairly modest graphics requirements so quite a few cards from both vendors will run the game well.  I think the 9800GTX+ is on sale right now on Tiger Direct for 119 or something like that, one of those is powerful enough to max out all graphics settings and get astounding frame rates, if you do not have PCI-X 6 pin power connectors you are going to be limited to lower end cards much of which will still run COD4 respectably.

I use it myself, less memory usage..|`|1CLazt8Taa	Adobe reader is a program that can open files in the .pdf format    A lot of shopping websites upload catalogues of there products in the PDF format so you'd need Adobe Reader installed to be able to open them, and it's free.
Ardz6306aa	Something wrong with her microphone. This happened to me. Either your AIM volume is off, something wrong with her microphone, or the connection is not stable.|`|r6SMD7Qeaa	your microphone is probably off or not working.  make sure that you have your mic volume up so that it can pick up your voice.  Then check the AIM settings for microphone.  If that doesn't work than it is probably her headphone device or her volume is not up enough.

1ZG6ZmxKaa	get DELL????|`|UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|sG7E4vDgaa	I just ordered a Dell Studio 17.|`|1JiRrZaNaa	i have an asus n50vn series it is super fast and does not get hot at all. the battery is fair. it has a built in web cam and is really self explanatory and i am very picky bout electronics|`|ML8J3nDDaa	uhh who are you. What is your budget. What type of programs do you want to use. What will you be using it for. etc. There are so many types of laptops that suit different people. For example there are Business class laptops, multimedia laptops, desktop-replacement laptops, ultra-portable laptops, netbooks, and tablets.

2YSKXb8Aaa	Ya I compared the specs as well, it should run it.  It'll probably run like crap though.  As earlier poster said, laptops are not meant for gaming, especially 600 dollar ones.  Seriously, if you can spend an extra 200-400 bucks on a desktop, it'll last ya 5+ years and still run fantastic.  Plus it's EASILY upgradeable.|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	it wouldn't work well. the intel gma x3100 is not very powerful. my dell laptop has it and it overheats with the sims 2 and crashes, so it'll probably be worse with the sims 3. don't go with integrated graphics, dedicated will be a lot better. stay away from anything with intel graphics basically  i also prefer intel core 2 duo over the celeron  it'll probably cost you more than the $600 though      if you don't care about brand names i would go with this laptop: http://www.ibuypower.com/ibp/store/confi...  the only thing i would change is to get a hard drive with 7200rpms and probably add the microsoft works 9.0 if you don't plan on buying microsoft office|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	Well for starters dell is one of the worst computer out there, horrible tech support and their laptops are known for all sorts of issues.      But based on the specs of the computer and the sims 3 game    Sims 3 requirments    PC Processor TypeIntel? Pentium? 4 processor 2GHz or equivalent     Dell laptop     Intel Celeron 550 Processor 2.13 GHz     Sims 3 requirments    PC System Memory 1GB RAM    Dell laptop    3 GB of system memory    Sims 3 requirments    PC Hard Drive Space6.5GB with 1GB additional space for custom content    Dell laptop    250GB hard drive     Sims 3 requirments    128MB NVIDIA GeForce, ATI RADEON or Intel Extreme Graphics video card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0    Dell laptop    Intel GMA X3100 Dynamic Video Memory Technology 4.0       The system memory and hard drive are fine and the processor you probably could get away with, but you may run into some lag with the game due tot he video card.    Laptops really are not the best suited to play the sims, not unless of course it is the made for laptop version, like they did with sims 2.

uAOkRBA0aa	it is not a good idea to be messing about in the registry if you do not know what you are doing, delete the wrong thing and you could cause a complete system crash.    use malwarebytes first.    you can get malwarebytes here,   this is a direct download link so you should have no trouble getting it.  click on this link  and then select run.  http://www.malwarebytes.org/affiliates/2...  install it preferably to your desktop, update it, then run a full scan and delete everything it finds.    some viruses will disable it so  if malwarebytes will not startup   then go into the folder it is in and rename the mbam file to XXX   then double click on the file you just renamed to start it up.    after you have used malwarebytes then do this online scan.  to make sure you have nothing else hiding away.  http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html  preferably in safe mode with networking.    to help you tidy up your comp use Advanced System Care Free http://www.iobit.com/    ?|`|XXQNsa9gaa	SQLOLEDB - if you break that down a little, you will see instead SQL OLE DB, which is referring to an SQL Server Object Linking and Embedding Database setting. Which is a legitimate Microsoft function.

xQDC487Faa	did you upgrade your wireless card to N as well?|`|0fb8bc0361a3c044e8ab71aede839879aa	I believe the new "N" technology improves range and internal network speed (file sharing between machines).    Bandwidth (download/upload speeds) are capped by your ISP. 330 KB/s is more than likely a 3Mbps connection.    Becareful when posting, because 330 Kbps (kilobits) and 330 KB/s (kilobytes) are two totally different things (1 kilobyte = 1024 kilobits).
LlEr2OdBaa	The first thing you should know is that you should always buy the higher end older card vs the low end new card. I have a 7900GS and it runs games better than an 8500 or lower 8000 card would. The other pieces you should consider are a new processor and more ram. I have 4 gigs of ram and a dual core 2.4 ghz intel processor and it won't run COD4 with all settings on high. I would suggest sticking with your current card and upgrading more of your computer first.|`|1ec5c3ef48df0b4438ce6e3638f0bdeaaa	eh not really too great especially since the rest is so old.  but any better card will be a bottle neck.  no problems just dont expect great performance. and really youd be better served buying a new mobo,ram,cpu, and vid card. $200 is what i payed and i max all those games out at 1680x1050|`|JJMDTReJaa	It's pretty good, It'll definitely run, probably on high. Fallout may be the harder one of the two so it may not max out for you,|`|fq5ktEQIaa	yeah it will run.. i guess.   i have the PNY 9600gso OCd 768mb so it runs Cod4 on 1400x900 res and everything maxed out Fallout is also maxed out.. um.. about the processor,, i have a pentium dual core and its fine.. so youre should be good. i got the card for 99 dollars|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	no a 9600gt would be much better but i suggest a 9800gtx at least for high end gaming.  9600gt http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...  9800gtx http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...  ati 4850 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...  any one would be good.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	yes its VERY GOOD FOR GAMING

You can do this by locating the command prompt in the start menu and right-clicking on it and selecting "Run as administrator".|`|IyCnihLmaa	Open Explorer  (not ms internet explorer)  by right click on Start and select Explore.    Select the C drive (or whichever drive you want to check)  Right click and select Properties.  Then select the Tools tab.  On Error Checking, click the button.  Windows will likely need to reboot and start the disk check.  Let it continue until it ends (it may take awhile)  This will check your HD for errors.  It can fix some errors so it is wise to allow it to continue checking if it ever wants to     (doesn't happen frequently and sometimes happens just because you shut the computer off without going through the shutdown procedure - although it will also want to check if it detects errors)

rMs4WBfcaa	Link Systems
H8bfXVChaa	Just follow these steps and check if you are able to do it.    Open command prompt  1. go to Run and type "cmd" and hit enter    Check if your computer is receiving the packets.  1. type 127.0.0.1 in the command prompt and press enter.  you should see the packets been received.     now if you have a router check if you can receive the packets from it  1. you will need to ping the router.  type this on the command prompt ping xxx.xxx.x.x and hit enter (x is where your router IP should be.. you can get this from the user manual of the router)    once that's pinging  type this on the command prompt  ping www.google.com and hit enter.    If you do not receive the packets from google it means your something to do with your ISP. call them and see. (of course if you changed the router settings incorrectly, this also will not connect you to the internet).    P.S. if your router is not giving back the ping then check the physical connection from the computer to the router.    If you cannot ping 127.0.0.1 then your NIC (network interface card) is at fault. you might need to check it with your motherboard vender.    If it is successful you should see something like this   ======================================...

Njb2yfgDaa	Okay. My friend just got one and I've been helping her too lol. Once you figure out a few things you will love it. Up in the corner of your screen you should have a silver thing called mackintosh HD click on it and go to applications. There you will find everything on your computer. Big Bang Board games gives you various games such as tic tac toe, checkers, chess, backgammon and mancala. There's also an application for making your own comics too. If you run your mouse on the bar on the bottom you over the little icons they will name what they are. Photobooth allows you to take cool pic and change your background or face. Imovie allows you to create your own movie. Garageband allows you to make your own music. Internet is the compass, pages(word) the ink pot and pen, keynote(powerpoint) the podium. Move the arrow to the right hand corner and your widgets will show up you can play game check weather, check spelling ect. You can get more for free at apple.com and manage them and add more by pressing the + sign at the bottom. If you have more question you can either go to the apple store or go to apple.com for more help and tips. You are really lucky to get a macbook as a gift, I know top computer programers ect who all say they are the kings of the computer industry. You should have no problems but if you do go to the apple store and they will fix it for free onsite with most computer companies don't do. One thing though if you don't already have Ilife 09 on your comp don't try to download it for free, it's macs first and only virus. Otherwise you should have no worries. Good luck and have fun!|`|U5KtVodYaa	idk about any of that but if u want to get rid of it i'll be glad to take it off you hands|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	that's a very nice and perhaps expensive computer.. have you seen the commercials?

You might try downloading and burning it again, as there may be something wrong with your disc.    Also, you could try burning something else with the same brand of CD-R using the same burner, to make sure there isn't something wrong with the burner or media.    Another option would be to try booting from the disc on a different computer (it won't install anything, don't worry). If it works, there may be a problem with your friend's CD drive or other hardware on his/her computer.|`|4733bdc050d9d2540e2bd17782783a5aaa	Probably a bad image, try re downloading and burning Ubuntu.

There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|23199b21cfd8fa260dd90623c1817eeeaa	It would be cheaper if you install Windows XP, performance would be much better.|`|ML8J3nDDaa	Minimum Requirements you will want.

ssbkAyWJaa	A test PC for the Windows 7 Beta that meets these minimum hardware recommendations (specific to the Beta and subject to change in the final version of Windows 7). Please do not use a PC you rely on for your work or daily use:  - 1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit processor   - 1 GB of system memory   - 16 GB of available disk space   - Support for DirectX 9 graphics with 128 MB memory (in order to enable Aero theme)   - DVD-R/W Drive   - Internet access (to download the Beta and get updates)     There is no official release for the final yet. The RC is supposed to come out in April which will be a newer build of Windows 7 and improved fixes. In my opinion, the final will be out sometime in Fall - Christmas this year.    Check out the links in the sources if you plan on installing Windows 7. One of the main things to remember is this:    Do download the Release Notes. Release Notes provide important information that you should know before installing and using Windows 7. You should familiarize yourself with all of the known issues in this document prior to installing the software. For example, the Release Notes describe a bug in which MP3 files may become corrupted and provide information on mitigating risk.    This is how i would install Windows 7:   - Backup important files  - Download the Windows 7 ISO  - Burn the ISO to a DVD  - Install Windows 7  - Install all the latest updates, make sure that in the list of updates, that the KB961367 update is in the list. If it is, that's good, if not, you can get the information and the download here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961367  - Restart if necessary  - Transfer all your files onto your computer  - Enjoy!|`|eDjiOWKtaa	Windows 7 is a much faster and more efficient OS than Windows Vista on every level from user interface to memory consumption.|`|4733bdc050d9d2540e2bd17782783a5aaa	Under the hood Windows 7 is just Vista its whats they did with it that's the technological evolution I would assume it has the same specs as Vista does if you can run Vista you most probably can run Windows 7.

If you have the router, open up IE or Firefox and type in "192.168.1.1" without quotes in the address bar. This is the routers IP address (at least most routers are). The default username/password can be found by googling your model or perhaps in the manual it came with (if it did).    From here you can enable/disable wireless transmission.    If it's a wireless card (which it sounds like) and it's not finding ANY wireless networks it can be several things. You may have a third party application setup to handle wireless networks (Windows or DLink) or the card or wireless switch (laptops) may be turned off/disabled.    You lack some of the detail needed to help. User/Password for what? Windows? A router?    You shouldn't have to add a device unless you are installing an aftermarket card in which you'd run the CD and then shutdown, install the device and turn it back on.

So say that the first random number you generate is 79 and the user says it is too high.  Delete all keys from the hash 79 and higher.  Generate the next random number from the remaining keys.  Say it is 13 and the user says it is too low.   Delete everything 13 and below.  And so on.

Long story short, something's wrong with the fan, and it makes a godawful racket on top of not cooling as much as it should. Some people have gotten new cards from HP, some haven't, and NIVIDIA refuses to deal with it.    My recommendation? If possible, buy a new fan and just replace the fan, not the whole card.

6YufKn6Faa	With 280 Dollars U.S., you should invest in the ATI Radeon 4870HD Video Card.      If you prefer Nvidia, I believe the Nvidia GTX 260 has been marked down.   Maybe for twenty dollars more you can get a GTX 280.     Since you only have a PCIE slot (make Sure its PCIE 2.0 slot) SLI and Cross fire (2 Video cards linked) is out of the question.     Some good ATI brands are VisionTek, HIS, Sapphire, ASUS, and PowerColor. VisionTek is usually the brand I will go with.   All ATI Cards come with 1 year Warranty so if defective, you can send it to the manufacturer and they will fix it, or give you a new one. Or you can return it back to the store where you purchased it from.     Some good Nvidia card Manufacturers Include, BFGtech, EVGA, ASUS, and XFX. I prefer BFGtech and ASUS. Video card Warranties for Nvidia Cards depends on the manufacturer. BFGtech and EVGA provide Limited Lifetime Warranties, so if there are any defects, or if the card dies based on faulty electronics or built, you can send it back to the manufacturer along with the receipt to either get a new one or a refurbished one.   BFGtech and EVGA also have Trade-up Programs in which you buy a video card within 90 days of purchase, you can trade-up to a better model and all you do is send your old card back to them, along with receipt, and the price difference between the two cards, and you will receive the higher model video card. (so lets say you buy the GTX 260, then a week later the GTX 280 prices drops down to a 10 dollar difference, you can ship the GTX 260, the reciept, Trade-up Form and the 10 dollars, and you will receive the GTX 280, along with receipt.)    www.newegg.com is a good place to shop and order, they provide excellent customer support and RMA support. Their Prices are also the lowest you can find.     If you don't prefer online purchasing, I'm sure there are Computer Stores near where you live, such as Fry's Electronics, Microcenter, or COMPUSA.

I'll set it up:    void generateBitStrings(int length) {  .....  }    Here's a hint that shows the recursive nature of this problem:    1. Generate bit strings of length N-1 and append 0 to all of them.    2. Generate bit strings of length N-1 and append 1 to all of them.    3. In this process you will generate all possible bit strings of length N.
5m5NlauFaa	File Allocation Table (FAT) is a file system that was created by Microsoft in 1977. FAT is still in use today as the preferred file system for floppy drive media and portable, high capacity storage devices like flash drives.<br>  <br>  FAT was the primary file system used in all of Microsoft's consumer operating systems from MS-DOS through Windows ME. The New Technology File System (NTFS) is the primary file system on Microsoft's newer operating systems but FAT is still a supported option.<br>  <br>  The File Allocation Table file system has seen advancements over time primarily due to the need to support larger hard disk drives and larger file sizes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try this article to chalk out the advantages:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Alloca...</a>
IFtV7g2Zaa	The answer depends on your network.  Since you're using Domain Local as one of your choices, I'll assume that you're on a domain controlled network with active directory residing elsewhere.<br>  <br>  None of your 4 groups are actual built-in groups for a Microsoft domain.  Obviously they could be created, but that doesn't tell me enough to answer this question, because I wouldn't know who was in the groups.<br>  <br>  The quickest way to prevent access from unauthenticated users is to deny access to all folders and files to anybody who falls into the Guests or Domain Guests security group.  To set this option on all files and folders of a computer, I would execute the following statement from an MSDos command prompt for each drive.  The example shown below is for the C: drive.<br>  <br>  cacls C:\ /T /E /D "domain\guests" "domain\domain guests"<br>  <br>  I usually run this command on specific folders, so if it doesn't work at the drive level, you might have to do each folder individually.  Use the command:<br>  <br>  for /d %x in (*) do @echo "y" | cacls "%x" /T /E /D "domain\guests" "domain\domain guests"<br>  <br>  from the root directory of each drive on the computer instead.<br>  <br>  In both cases, the cacls command edits the existing ACL for the specified folder and all subfolders and files.  It denies access to the two specified groups.<br>  <br>  As an added security, I would disable the guest account for the domain.  I would add any former employees who still have accounts on the domain (even if they've been disabled) to the guests security group.<br>  <br>  On each individual computer attached to the network, I would remove local permissions and add only domain level permissions...and password protect the local Administrator account.<br>  <br>  Does this help?

I had the versions Antivirus 2008 2009 and 2010 but it sounds like the same thing. Basically you get it unknowingly by clicking a tainted link that on a tainted website. You won't even know it until it looks like something your computer already had installed to scan for viruses. When it pops up doing its "scan" that is it loading itself. <br>  <br>  Anyway if this sounds like what you got, I got rid of it via McAfee.com but I do not recommend that. I paid $90 each time to get rid of it and it kept coming back even after I bought the total McAfee security protection. McAfee also has very poor customer service so I don't recommend dealing with them, but it is a quick solution if you have $90 laying around.<br>  <br>  My friend had this virus too and she took it to our University's library and they were able to remove it for free for her. I'm not sure if you'll have access to this type of thing but if you do that should work. Definitely don't try removing it yourself, because it will just let it get worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|t7sUZQvFaa	You need to go in "Safe with networking mode and battle the fake popups like a video game and when it slows you should be able to download "Malwarebytes" and use the file assassin to put a hurtin to this bug! here's 2 videos that explains the whole process in detail!

vK53Hh8naa	First, you will need all login information to server, configurations, etc.<br>  <br>  You can keep the domain and hosting. Just change the domain name registration to your name and take over the hosting payments. You can also transfer the domain name to another host if the hosting was provided privately by the previous admin. Small fees are usually involved in domain name transfers.<br>  <br>  You won't need to use the same software he used unless it is required by your manager. If you are going to keep the previous hosting, and the website was designed with Frontpage, then you have a choice to make between using Frontpage, since its the only way to work with those websites, or to begin your website from scratch with something else like Nvu.<br>  <br>  As for the scratch part, its all about situation and preference. If your previous admin takes his hosting, he will be taking his old website with him, which will leave with a domain name but no website. If that's the case, then its scratch for your. Otherwise, its really your choice if you want to take over the old stuff. Personally, i would start from scratch just because it gives you a handle on what to do later on if a problem occurs.<br>  <br>  If you need to start from scratch, most CMSs have configuration pages that are actually pretty helpful and the templates available are not necessarily "few".|`|WCKbJwd0aa	Your first step would be to get the login information for the cPanel of the site. Then you can go in there and change login information and account information. In the cPanel you should be able to find the FTP information (File Transfer Protocol).

Or just keep using the old website.|`|CB15kchkaa	I'm a little unsure what you want to do. If you have a cms site running already, plus the domain names, then it's simply a matter of having the previous administrator log into admin and add you as admin. Then he no longer needs to have anything to do with the site and you just take over where he left off.<br>  Alternatively, if you want to start from scratch then most hosting companies offer you a choice of forums to choose from when you take hosting from them. Then it's simply a matter of editing it to your preference and possibly changing the colour scheme or theme and filling it with members.<br>  If you wish to keep the domain name but change hosting companies then you simply log into the domain name account and change the nameservers to your new host.<br>  If you want to experiment for free have a look at this web site, it's just a demo, but it's really good as a cms. http:/www.cracklesnap.cashclimbers.com<br>  <br>  this is available with free hosting from <a href="http://yiphee.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://yiphee.co.cc</a> once you've created your free account, you would need to upload the site by going to the fantastico installer and selecting MK portal with AEF forum. It will then upload the site for you and you would have to complete the database settings, (email the host if you get confused, yadmin@yiphee.info). You then have a great cms portal with loads of features, next you will have to transfer domain names which you would do by simply following instructions in your control panel.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Taking over from another can be a major headache in any capacity.

That's compared to 112 stream processors on the 8800GT gamer card.<br>  <br>  The smaller GPU means it does not draw much electrical power.  Note the 8500 does not even have a 6-pin power connector that the more powerful cards need.

FjCcc561aa	Enable remote connections for SQL Server 2005 Express or SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition<br>  <br>  You must enable remote connections for each instance of SQL Server 2005 that you want to connect to from a remote computer. To do this, follow these steps:<br>  <br>  1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft SQL Server 2005, point to Configuration Tools, and then click SQL Server Surface Area Configuration.<br>  <br>  2. On the SQL Server 2005 Surface Area Configuration page, click Surface Area Configuration for Services and Connections.<br>  <br>  3. On the Surface Area Configuration for Services and Connections page, expand Database Engine, click Remote Connections, click Local and remote connections, click the appropriate protocol to enable for your environment, and then click Apply.<br>  <br>  Note Click OK when you receive the following message:<br>  <br>  Changes to Connection Settings will not take effect until you restart the Database Engine service. <br>  <br>  4. On the Surface Area Configuration for Services and Connections page, expand Database Engine, click Service, click Stop, wait until the MSSQLSERVER service stops, and then click Start to restart the MSSQLSERVER service.<br>  <br>  After that is completed, complete the following steps to ensure TCP/IP is enabled and is listening on the right port (or change to a port of your choice)<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] STEP 1: Enabling TCP/IP<br>  <br>  First we must tell SQL Server Express to listen on TCP/IP, to do this perform the following steps:<br>  <br>  1. Launch the SQL Server Configuration Manager from the "Microsoft SQL Server 2005 CTP" Program menu<br>  <br>  2. Click on the "Protocols for SQLEXPRESS" node,<br>  <br>  3. Right click on "TCP/IP" in the list of Protocols and choose, "Enable"<br>  [edit] STEP 2: To Browse or not to Browse<br>  <br>  Next, we have to determine if we want the SQL Browser service to be running or not. The benefit of having this service run is that users connecting remotely do not have to specify the port in the connection string. Note: It is a security best practice to not run the SQLBrowser service as it reduces the attack surface area by eliminating the need to listen on an udp port.<br>  <br>  OPTION A: If you want to always specify a TCP port when connecting (Not using SQL Browser service) perform the following steps else skip these steps:<br>  <br>  1. Launch the SQL Server Configuration Manager from the "Microsoft SQL Server 2005 CTP" Program menu<br>  <br>  2. Click on the "Protocols for SQLEXPRESS" node<br>  <br>  3. Click on the "TCP/IP" child node<br>  <br>  4. You will notice an entry on the right panel for "IPAll", right click on this and select, "Properties"<br>  <br>  5. Clear out the value for "TCP Dynamic Ports"<br>  <br>  6. Give a TcpPort number to use when making remote connections, for purposes of this example lets choose, "2301"<br>  <br>  <br>  At this point you should restart the SQL Server Express service. At this point you will be able to connect remotely to SQL Express. A way I like to check the connection is my using SQLCMD from a remote machine and connecting like this:<br>  <br>  SQLCMD -E -S YourServer\SQLEXPRESS,2301<br>  <br>  The "," in the server name tells SQCMD it's a port.<br>  <br>  So you've tried this and still get an error. Take a look at Step 3, this should address the remaining issue.

g7M1DxFCaa	To be honest that's quite an old machine and not really worth spending any money on. I've got a Fujitsu Lifebook with very similar specifications and that runs XP okay, it too had Windows 2000 on it when I got it.  If you have another computer and can link them by LAN then there's a way to do this without buying any more hardware.  1) Defragment the laptop's drive  2) Open the computer management console, accessible from the start menu (you can right click the start button and alter the menu's properties to make it shown if you can't see it).  Navigate to the disk management page.  Change the size of the drive's partition to leave about 800Mb spare, then make another partition in this section and format it.  3) Open this drive with explorer, make a folder in and make it shared to the network or just make the whole drive shared.  4) Link the two computers, on your other machine find this shared folder by browsing the network.  It's a lot easier if the other machine is running XP because Vista is a pain in the [insert rude word here]  5) Put your XP setup disk in your other computer then copy all it's contents into the shared folder/drive on your laptop    Now you have a choice.  You can either make a boot floppy and use it to start the laptop and format the C drive partition or you can just use it to boot the machine if you want to leave your files on the drive (but you'll have to find and delete any junk yourself afterwards - I doubt that there's that much space, you could always copy everything that you want to save into your other computer)     Ok, so now we have your computer started, sat there with the A:> prompt    type the following:  D:\(your folder if you made one\)SETUP  alternatively just navigate the partition until you find SETUP and run it    The XP installer will run as normal, you have the choice of installing in C:\WINDOWS or creating another folder name if you decided to leave 2000 on the drive (It'll advise you not to use the same partition but it'll actually work a treat and will become a multiboot system)    Once XP is up and running, open the disk management page of computer management, delete the partition that you put the setup files on then extend the main partition to fill the whole drive.  That's it, job done!    Alternatively, you may be able to just borrow a CD drive from another laptop, they often have different bits of plastic screwed to them but they're nearly all the same shape.    If anyone says anything about making a setup disk with SATA drivers then just forget it, you're machine's too old for you to need to do that.    It'll run a lot smoother if you add as much RAM as it can handle.  I think my Fujitsu Lifebook, with the same Intel chipset takes up to 256MB of PC100 RAM, however that only had one slot so if yours has two then it may take 512MB.  Of course, you could always install Linux instead, it'd probably run a lot quicker.    EDIT:  It may be easier to use a USB memory stick to hold the contents of the XP setup disk instead, although it'll obviously be slower to copy from.  You'll probably still need to copy the contents onto the hard drive before you run the installer as the Windows installer may not be able to access it during setup.  Many of these memory sticks can be configured as bootable but it's doubtful that your hardware will allow you to boot from USB.  If it does then simply format the memory stick as a boot drive, make a folder on it and copy the XP setup files to it. Then boot from it and run the XP setup program from there.  I'm sorry that it's such a long response, you'll probably be able to skip some of the steps but I just wish to include as much info and alternative methods as possible.  Honestly, it's really quite easy to do.|`|AA10834300	You'll need at least 512Mb RAM to run XP nicely. That's 524,288Kb.    There is not point installing XP on this computer if it only has 128Mb of RAM. It will run really slow.    That spec is okay for Win 98 or Win 2000 which you have.    You would be better off buying a new computer or a second hand computer with XP pre-installed.    By the time you've added RAM and bought a CD/DVD drive you would have spent the same amount of money.
