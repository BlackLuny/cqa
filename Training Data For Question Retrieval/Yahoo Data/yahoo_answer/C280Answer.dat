ThKkn5fKaa	The castrati have been replaced by counter tenors.  The voice is very similar in both range, and how it is produced.  The castration allowed for males to keep their child voice, which singers refer to as falsetto.  That obviously doesn't happen nowadays, so instead, we have the counter tenor.  One of the main reasons that we lose most or our falsetto voice as we grow older is for the simple fact that we don't use it.  For example, I'm a 24 year old baritone, and I've reached a point in my singing where my falsetto can only go one whole step above my standard voice.  It's almost entirely disappeared.  But counter tenors consistently use their falsetto so as to ensure that it remains a viable singing voice.  It is a ton of work, and, simply put, you have to have a very unique anatomy to even attempt studying as a counter tenor.    That being said, there are very few world class counter tenors in the world, but there are plenty of operas with roles that were intended for castrati.  So today, those roles are typically sung by female mezzo-sopranos, and they are known as "pants roles".|`|KEtyfDwraa	I think there might be one lift, but he could have died by now.  They stopped castrating those boys at the turn of the century, if I'm remembering my music history clearly, because of how horrible it is.      If you get the chance, you should find a recording of one, its so weird, and the recording I heard this guy hit a D above the treble staff, so weird.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	The castration of males for this purpose is now outlawed in all those countries where castrati were popular. Instead we have some superb counter tenors like Paul Esswood who are able to perform these roles.

From the time the ferris wheel fills up at 10 minutes past the hour until the last passenger steps off at 10.30, a total of 21 sets of passengers will  have taken a ride on the ferris wheel|`|j8iTPvfyaa	no people ride the wheel. they ride in the cars. so 0
IVh0MPv7aa	thats if Darude can keep making classic and good tunes like Tiesto, cos i mean Sandstorm is thee song like. But Tiesto does so many good tunes over and over, not like one hit wonders, cus personally i think the only good Darude tune is sandstorm!|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	no it would have happened by now...tiesto is more versatile dropping some house and tech house in his sets darude keeps it a bit harder
dyV9MPhDaa	This is one of the great songs form the 70's, I agree.  From 67-79 is the best era for rock.  I love this song, always have. I was around for its release.  And it is the song played on my favorite TV show's season finale for the past 3 seasons. Making it kick butt for 2 reasons.|`|X3dbuLL3aa	It's listenable ....OKAY IS MY ANSWER.  Try "Point of No Return"  instead.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Ugh, no, that's an overplayed song, Kansas has better.    But it's your opinion, and I respect that.|`|dYyiG90caa	I LOVE Kansas -- Especially "Leftoverture" --    But, I HATE That Song, because it was written, arranged, and recorded, to be Their "Breakout" Commercial Hit -- and it was.    It "Hard Rock" OverTones, Ruins the Remainder of an Amazing Album --  "The Wall"  4:51   "What's on My Mind"  3:28   "Miracles Out of Nowhere"  6:28   "Opus Insert"  4:28   "Questions of My Childhood"  3:40   "Cheyenne Anthem"  6:55   "Magnum Opus"  8:35     Sorry. -- I am sure Most of Your Answers will Agree with You :)  .|`|SBVGQ5S1aa	Good tune...  One of their best.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	It's always great to see another teenager who appreciates the music of the 1960's and 70's :)    Though there is at least one current band that could achieve such greatness :~  Blackmore's Night  But, of course, their guitarist was a founder member of two Classic Rock bands...      I see my immature little w@*ker of a troll is back...|`|AA11452399	It is a classic, I agree. The 60's and 70's kicked butt!!|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Great song!! I love Kansas :)|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	No, I don't really agree. But don't hold it against me. I was actually alive then.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	I agree! Excellent 70's track. They were a great band. Love the guitar riff.
ME4XWNmRaa	Its because music back then had heart and soul in it. People actually played their instruments instead of electronic machines playing the parts like they do today. Music meant something back then and it is pretty much useless today.I weep for the children growing up today with all the crap they have to listen to.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Actually it doesn't always.    One of the best songs I've ever heard, released in the Mid 2,000s    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-iZ-jJae...    This music is out there, You just gotta look.     That being said I Myself am a huge fan of 70's Music, but today is nearly as good in the right genres.|`|URO3gDXcaa	you are correct, young man.  its all about the money now and the music then.|`|5eGs0wKPaa	i love the 60s and 70s music too they had more emotional deep lyrics and a real passion for the music. nowadays they really only care about their image|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	A lot of it has to do with the analog equipment they used back then.  All of the amps and effects were analog as well as the reel-to-reel tape that they recorded on.      Much of what we here today is digital (more convenient) and the sound is not as "warm" as what they had back then.|`|jfEb0tIJaa	Your correct becasue their are very few bands that now want to take a risk and evolve the sound of rock.  Back in the 60's and 70's literally is was all about the music.  Now a days its all about filling in the formula for whatever the template you want to play rock, pop, coutry ect and marketing this crap to the masses.  Back in the 60's and 70's rock music was still evolving so they could do no wrong.    Their are some very good bands today ie Opeth, Tool, Mars Volta to name a few that are not afraid to think outside of the box when it comes to their art.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	yes because most of todays rock, they actually cant play and its all done electronically to be enhanced. take dragonforce for example, they cant play for ****. but if you listen to another band like deep purple live, especially when they played Highway Star in Made In Japan, its amazing, because they actually know how to play the music that they make    *edit*    the guy who did the link to helloween, aren't they from early 1990s? or am I just wrong?|`|afxfy4Staa	sure!  look what you can hear is:  DREAM THEATER  METALLICA  DIO  led zeppelin  ac/dc  deep purple  black sabath  judas priest  iron maiden  symphony x  van halen  Slayer  Whitesnake  Ark  Audioslave  Guns n' roses  Pink floyd  Red hot chili peppers  Scorpions  Exodus  Rainbow    im sure you will love!|`|IxYVHATXaa	The popular rock of today is influenced heavily on other genres. Like punk, pop, hip hop, etc. The classic rock bands of then would be like the hard rock or metal bands of today.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	I dunno, we tend to romanticize of days were weren't really a part of.  It's funny, I was over at a friend's house this weekend and he was having a party. He had a video of Tom Jones on, it was a compilation of performances.  On it, there were duets of Tom with Janis Joplin and Joe Cocker, both rising stars of the hippie movement there singing with a POP star!!!  WTF! Tom Jones???  I began to think, hey these guys were out to sell records too.  Many of these singers became millionaires and began to march to a different drummer ... the record executive.  None of these acts toured and performed for free, all had promoters and managers, and all eventually became a part of the machine .... don't get me wrong, most still hung on to some semblance of integrity, but with money comes drugs and fame and sex and groupies and soon most became corrupt washed up junkie rock stars.    Fast forwards to today ... Sure the airwaves are polluted with Pop/Rock pseudo intellectuals and bubble gum pin up singers, rappers, and electronica ... but, if you look deep enough, there are still some pretty good acts out there.  You just have to know where to find them.  Internet radio, listen to College radio etc.

She called me today telling me she couldn't stop reading it and was telling me the part she is in. I would try reading the book. And watching the movie. It's a really good romance It will make you wonder whats gonna happen next.|`|1NNXPAinaa	My mom is 46 and my sister got her the books in spanish for xmas. She absolutely fell in love with them, so I think age dosent matter.    I also went to watch the movie the first day it came out w. My sister and my best friend.    My sister got us the tickets in advanced and really enjoyed the movie, and she's a 24 yr old college student.    I would recomend reading the book though, it makes the movie much more exciting!=)|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	Well you would like it if you are into romance.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	well I'm 20 and I find it a little young for me..but its a really good story, and not very violent considering its about Vampires...but I think I like it most because they  had some sexy vamps in there! lol|`|JlEucUVtaa	-20 out of 10 without seeing it.|`|nci2WOYXaa	It's very cheesy, inoffensive, romance-novel type stuff. I doubt anyone over the age of 15 and female would have much use for it but apparently women seem to like these books. I've not understood why from watching the first movie though|`|MHHy90D5aa	no comment|`|2nkCO7HLaa	Yes!!!!,  Great book...  I have read all of them.  Everyone can read it but most of the younger fans get more into!!!  But give it a try!! :)  -ginny:)|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	My mother is 36-year-old stay at home mom and she has fallen head over heels for Twilight. We saw the movie together and you can bet that we'll be one of the first ones to buy the movie. If you like romance, suspense, humor and amazing actors that can actually act.. I'm sure you'll like it.|`|2ank9eSIaa	I know an over 40 year old mum who LOVED the film, and, if you don't like it then don't see it again but it's good to try and I think the film is AMAZING but then again I have seen it 3 times and read the books 20 billion times :D    X0|`|lrWcBlcnaa	It would be better to read the book first, but watching the movie is okay.    It doesn't fully explain some things that are already fully understood by an audience member who has read the book.    For the budget they had, I agree with the rating it got. 3/5 Stars.|`|DgBpjcD6aa	Personally I love Twilight, however I must admit that I have read the books.  If you enjoy a romance between two people who fall in love despite all odds, then you'll love this.  Personally I loved the movie, my mom went to see it, heck my dad even saw it.  I think reading the books allows you to understand the characters better and see them in a different light, but not everyone enjoys reading.  I would recommend Twilight to you, it was a well done movie and the actors/actresses portrayed the characters very well.  With that said think about reading the novels, they are worth reading!

0HGqGJYTaa	You ask good q's.    Mine is in Virgo in the 8th house. I think it's true for me.    Juno in Virgo: You need a partner who is efficient, works hard, and watches out for your health. All right, so they may be a little critical at times (or at all times), especially if your Juno has stress aspects (the square, opposition, and some conjunctions).     Juno in Scorpio (8th house): The need is for a partner who is intense, strong, and a bit secretive. They definitely must be good in bed.|`|369vsqhgaa	I have Juno in Aries.I think it is kinda scary from the interpretation i read.It's like a control freak thing.You can read it here:  http://www.astrology.ca/lessons/juno.htm...  http://www.bobmarksastrologer.com/Juno21...|`|90lqletLaa	I have Juno in Capricorn in the 3rd house.

AA10289523	Many cartoons over the years have featured flea circuses in one way or another, mostly in cartoon-ish and unrealistic ways:    The Tex Avery cartoon The Flea Circus featured a French flea circus that broke up when they saw a dog and attacked it, and one flea, Francois (voiced by Bill Thompson), who played a sad clown, hitches with the star flea, Fifi, and has enough fleas together to bring the flea circus back to life. Another vintage Warner Bros. cartoon, Curtain Razor, has Porky Pig as a theatrical agent auditioning acts, including a shaggy dog, who turns out to be the transport of a flea circus, which proceeds to set itself up, perform, and return to the dog, on command.   A Bug's Life, the Disney film, centers on a troupe of flea circus performers, including their owner, P.T. Flea, a parody of the real-life circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum.   Movies have also featured or referenced flea circuses:    The Charlie Chaplin movie Limelight features Chaplin performing a flea circus.   Mischa Auer plays a flea circus owner (with real fleas) in Orson Welles's film Mr. Arkadin.   The City of Lost Children features a former circus/freak show owner, Marcello, who uses performing fleas carrying poison to assassinate people.   In the movie Jurassic Park Creator of Jurassic Park John Hammond explains how he used to exhibit a flealess mechanical flea circus when he was first starting out.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I beleive they were fleas and it was a flea circus. Fifi the singing flea (with a French accent) was the main attraction and she was in love with the little sad clown flea (Francois).  Is that the one?    Thank you, I have amassed a lot of useless knowledge... that apparently isn't that useless. lol    By the way, I believe that was one of the cartoons shown along with Tom & Jerry.
9a384d40c397dc3065aeb9f23d18f7e7aa	Authentic (also closed or standard) cadence: V to I (or IV - V - I). The phrase perfect cadence is sometimes used as a synonym for authentic cadence, but can also have a more precise meaning depending on the chord voicing:  Perfect authentic cadence (PAC): The chords are in root position; that is, the roots of both chords are in the bass, and the tonic (the same pitch as root of the final chord) is in the highest voice. A PAC is a progression from V to I in major keys, and V to i in minor keys. This is generally the strongest type of cadence.  Half (or open, or imperfect) cadence: any cadence ending on V, whether preceded by V of V, ii, IV, or I, or any other chord. Because it sounds incomplete or "suspended", half cadence is considered a weak cadencethe weakest cadence, in fact.  Deceptive (or interrupted) cadence: V to any chord other than I (typically ii, vi or VI). This is considered a weak cadence because of the "hanging" (suspended) feel it invokes. One of the most famous examples is in the coda of the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582 by Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach repeats a chord sequence ending with V over and over, leading the listener to expect resolution to Ionly to be thrown off completely with a thunderous fermata on a D flat major chord. Following a pregnant pause, the "real" ending commences.  In a major scale the V-I chords in G are D E F  & G and in F they are  C D E & F   i hope this helps.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Which cadences?  There are more than 4 cadences.|`|tfeseeeRaa	It shows.....hehehehehe    I believe in music one interpretation of cadence is the bits that terminate a musical phrase   Think of A........men. You know at the end of a hymn.  That's a cadence.    As to your question you could use  Gminor  C7 F major.  or  G minor Fsharp( 7) F major.  OK?  Did I get a thumbs down because my post is correct or because the O/poster wanted to get her own back.  Only arskin'

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Critters (1986)? I've never seen this movie, to be honest.  But there were a few movies released about the same time about trolls and little creatures. Until someone else provides a better suggestion, you can look here: http://www.imdb.com/keyword/troll/  I looked at this one called The Boy Who Loved Trolls (1984) (TV) and a boy found a troll under a bridge, not in a cave. Was the troll-like-creature scary?    EDIT: Oh, I'm glad that you found it! Did you know that there's a sequel that was made a couple years later? It's called Munchie Strikes Back (1994). http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110593/|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Is it live-action? There is a movie titled "Upworld" aka "A Gnome Named Gnorm" (1990). I haven't seen it for a very long time, so I don't recall much about it.

LOL!|`|AA11609168	what the heck are Romantic comedy chick flicks?|`|YMnTveWuaa	I got this move I wanna try out. It's called "The Mapco Move".<br>  <br>  Do you think it could ever work?|`|k8QlPisUaa	If i tell you i'd have to sleep with you... wait...<br>  I'm confused now. <br>  I think you could teach me or something.|`|AA10021017	"Mastering Kama Sutra after dark", ima guessing it could be a Romantic comedy if it was done wrong, itsa more like a do it yourself exercise movie for 2 at nite time, or daytime with blindfolds...i hope i said that right...|`|BKr3y30maa	Porn flicks, romantic comedy chick flicks, cartoons....you name it.  Everything inspires me! :)<br>  <br>  Oh wait, why is this just for guys? Women like these questions too! lol|`|54601f6ca2b038fe7a92154c08ebd2c9aa	Romantic comedies.  I am hung allot more like Adam Sandler than Ron Jeremy. :)<br>  Plus when you get naked it is harder to tell if they are laughing at your jokes or .....well...um....how do I put this so I won't get booted? It looks kinda like a button on a fur coat.|`|1y5IxCVyaa	I just tend to make my own moves. Play around til she gasps a little, and make a mental note for the future. That way every time is a new adventure|`|aGXankr2aa	Neither.<br>  <br>  The best way is to ask what she enjoys, she knows more about her body than anyone else, she should  know what rocks her boat and if you ask her you'll be able to send her overboard.|`|CphIBXMaaa	Mines Came Naturally; I don't watch Porn. If I can't participate I don't want to watch!|`|91M9ebuWaa	Real life.<br>  **** movies.<br>  everyone knows movies are hollywood crap.<br>  <br>  you live life and learn what it is to do what you do.<br>  <br>  hey... its worked so far.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Not only bt studying them, but by practice, practice, practicing them...|`|AA11207004	I just try different things and when she's screaming and moaning and I'm not on her hair, I make a note to do that again:)|`|6sgDopRBaa	getting EXP.

I'd like to vehemently disagree with those who say porn is no use as an educational tool. Back in the days before I was...erm...active...I watched enough of that stuff to go practically blind. When I finally found a woman who didn't despise the idea of being with me, all those years of...ahem...study...came in explosively useful.<br>  <br>  The thing is, people want different things in the pursuit than they do in the act. So you can learn a lot about charming people into bed from chick flicks, but more about what they want when you get 'em there from Chick Licks lol|`|b6nvN0uWaa	Back when I used to have sex with women, I got it from porn before my first time(s) then I started studying women's sexuality and every other possible connection to their sexuality. Finally after I have it all figured out I don't like them that way anymore.  :(  What a waist.|`|QUlDuixBaa	Porn is totally useless as an educational aid for men; it creates unrealistic expectations.

I am a giver and I try very hard to get my love to talk to me and find out what she likes and we begin there ...

Look back when they used corporal punishment in 50's and 60's there was very little juvenile delinquency and very little teen pregnancy.

24UPDIBTaa	It's on-going. The show airs Tuesdays at 7 p.m. central after local news on CBS in the U.S.<br>  <br>  A comment to the other users:<br>  There are three questions asked here and I addressed them all correctly and provided a link to the program's site. Why did the rest of you feel it necessary to repeat what I already answered? It isn't the intent of this site to pile on to one question when the answer is already there. Just move on or give a thumbs up to the right one. I've even deleted my answers before when I noticed someone else submitted it completely or better before mine sent. Go help somebody else out by taking on a question without the correct answer(s). On a side note, nice to see other NCIS fans around.|`|aiJJBDAjaa	Yup, both of the people who posted before me are right. It has new episodes on CBS every Tuesday at 8:00pm. Although, from what I have gathered, though I am not completely sure, tomorrow's episode, which is called South by Southwest, will be the last one to air for a few weeks. I believe the next new episode after this week's will be airing on March 17th. Here are some sites that have episode lists and information to help you understand what is going on incase you have missed anything:<br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/ncis/show/16772/summary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/ncis/show/16772/summar...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/ncis/100320" rel="nofollow">http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/ncis/1003...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cbsncis.wetpaint.com/?t=anon" rel="nofollow">http://cbsncis.wetpaint.com/?t=anon</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_series)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_(TV_se...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/</a><br>  <br>  I am pretty sure there will be more than 17 episodes, but most sites have not listed episodes past the 17th.

Mayer is cute and all, but Aniston can do way better.|`|e8lAALzgaa	John Mayer doesn't seem to be that into Jennifer Aniston, they'll break up eventually and he'll talk bad about her to the press like he did the first time they broke up.<br>  <br>  <br>  And I don't know why people continue to do this Angelina vs. Jen thing. It's been like 5 years, it's time to move on. I seriously doubt Angelina Jolie is jealous that Jennifer Aniston is dating John Mayer of all people.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	you might want to get a life

eqLFfXfyaa	Make sure your guitar is tuned. And just keep practicing, you've just hit a plateau.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	yep you can get worse, everybody has good and bad days, if you are sucking that bad just put it away and don't mess with it for a few days cuz you are probably burnt out on it. you don't want to be practicing wrong or you will be reinforcing these bad habits.|`|0Ifae2qJaa	You're in a rut, that's all. It's only temporary (hopefully)<br>  <br>  I've been playing for about 24 years and I've never improved at a constant rate so as long as you are putting in the effort I wouldn't be too concerned. It is quite possible that you are going into a new stage in your playing. There have been a number of times where I have made no progress over 6 months then all of a sudden things fell into place and I went up another level - kind of like growth spurts where you stay about the same height for a while and all of a sudden you've grown another inch taller, same thing.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is if you are playing the same old things you learned six months ago. Step it up and include something different, not so much more difficult but things that will force you to play differently.<br>  <br>  It will work out if you keep going at it - just not as quick as you might like.|`|5OgCrE3Yaa	Take a break, don't concentrate too hard. One time I went from hard to expert.  I was doing crappy.  I was actually trying. The next day I was just relaxed and playing and I almost aced a song. The day after that I, once again, tried to ace a song, but failed because I was trying too hard.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Dont worry, you will have up days and down days. I have been playing for years (many) Somedays are awesome, others, no matter what I do its just not up to par. There are lots of things that affect your playing. Stress is one.... Just relax... and don`t put too much pressure on yourself. You will get your groove back.|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	Sounds like you have just hit a wall, keep playing everything will be fine as long as you practice practice practice.

Miraculously, she managed to pry herself from it without a scratch. So, she waited on the side of the road until the officer came to help her. He was in awe. "Ma'am your car looks like it was jumped on by a family of elephants! Are you okay?" he asked. "Oh yeah I'm fine," the blonde replied. Amazed, the officer examines the wrecked car and finally asks, "How in the world did this happen?" So the blonde lady said, "Well I was driving on this road and out of nowhere a tree popped up! So I swerved to the right and there was another tree! And I swerved to the left and there was ANOTHER tree! And THEN I swerved..." "Ma'am" the officer cut her off. "There isn't a tree on the road for 30 miles. That was your air freshener swinging back and forth."|`|02fbdbcb3accaa074d38f84f03584aa3aa	A little boy and his dad are out walking to the park.  They see two dogs who are having sex and the little boy asks his dad what they are doing.  His dad says "they are making a puppy."  He seems to accept this and they go on their way.  Later that night the same little boy walks in on his parents having sex and he asks what they are doing.  Since it had went so well earlier, the dad says, "we are making a little brother or sister."  The boy thinks for a minute and then says, "well flip her over, I would rather have a puppy."|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton are all on board the Titanic. They are all on the top level and Nixon is about to jump in a lifeboat. Suddenly Ronald Reagan pulls him backwards and yells "Women and Children first!"

uel6NBOVaa	Hey Vevila, <br>  <br>  Yes, it is the degrees in which the planet falls in your chart. However, how high or low the degree is does not make it more or less prominent. The degrees are mostly significant in forming planetary aspects. They are also needed in using decans and other divisions. To really know map out the whole chart you really need the exact degrees, and that is why you need your exact birth time since the numbers are based off of the placement of your ascendant and the house divisions (I guess depending on the house system used).|`|tQW18Kspaa	I believe that is the degree to which the <br>  Planet is into the sign<br>  Sun 18.07  degrees into the sign of Libra

After all, our stereotype of Americans is that they are all fat and stupid but we all know that isn't particularly true.<br>  <br>  Why do we wear perfume?  Because we like it!  A shower or bath will clean you but it's nice to be able to smell a particular, favourite scent all day.

YoITGRvkaa	I agree with you, Katie. Heath definitely deserved that award! What an artistic and creative man that job had to take, from going to a GORGEOUS man to such a interesting character. He transformed into the roll and he very much, for his hard work, deserved the award granted to him. I do not think he won that award for what happened and because he died, but because he did a phenomenal job. It was so sad but also joyful to see everyone get teary-eyed during the acceptance speeches put on by the family. He certainly touched so many lives. R.I.P. Heath Ledger!|`|xCAbKKIOaa	heath ledger did an awesome job performing as the joker he deserves the oscar <br>  <br>          R.I.P heath ledger|`|ZcrqGl5Naa	JEALOUSLY|`|nQZEJz5yaa	IM GLAD HE WON!

Is the atmosphere made of sorrow?  Is the temperature forsakeno? Also, it depends on the population of the area of which the dark is approaching.  How heavy are their hearts?  Once we have accounted for all of these variables we may begin to calculate the speed of dark.  Say that the atmosphere is 20% sorrowful, the temperature is 72 forsakeno (the amount of forsaken at which judas traded jesus for money), and the area is a small population of 130 depressed teenagers.  0.20S / 72F X 130 DT = 0.36 BHPH (broken hearts per hour)|`|t8uzu54Faa	mr conan <br>  <br>  Ooh aah!! <br>  Its way to fast, getting faster and faster, I am getting dizzy now, stop!  stop !!

8ouVqW0Uaa	Here's the difference between the anime and the manga:<br>  <br>  1. Manga stays heavily focused on the main plot<br>  <br>  2. Anime is BASED ON the manga, but adds unnecessary plot that does not affect that main storyline (called "filler")<br>  <br>  In essence, they are both the "same" but anime adds more useless episodes.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you are in terms of shippuuden, but assuming that you're on the latest episode, I'll suggest:<br>  <br>  www.animeblogz.com - This site has a lot of anime, but just look for naruto shippuuden on the left side.<br>  <br>  www.crunchyroll.com - This site basically has EVERYTHING related to naruto, although it's not yet up to the latest episode. This site offers the best quality. I suggest you register to this site. It's very organized and easy to use.|`|QbSLCyUQaa	You can watch Naruto Shippuden at <a href="http://www.hulu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hulu.com</a><br>  You can buy Naruto Shippuden manga in English at Barnes & Noble or Borders|`|hFgXi9cSaa	first of all its not called "comic books" its called manga. second the manga's are created first the manga is the real story when u watch the anime ur watching about 50% filler. filler is usless stuff added to the anime that was not in the manga. doing this sapossably makes the anime more intresting.<br>  <br>  DVD's maybe of naruto but shippuden! blah not gonna happen 4 along time in the U.S. and i hope to god that it never does becuase america has turned great anime's into over rated crap! i dont hate dub but subed is better in naruto's case becuase dubed leav's out certain saying's,scens,episode's!!! so it can be suitable for a young crowd!?!?!?? hello,ninja's,blood,pervyness,sharp weapons!!!!<br>  <br>  but u can enjoy anime the way its sappos to be watch at animesquish.com

QziBNh0Uaa	Yes. She still is beautiful, but now in a more mature way.|`|lxg0yqUQaa	I think that Britney was really cute and innocent when she first made the hit-Baby one more time. As time went on she was hottest when her hit album ,In the Zone ,came out. The song like Toxic, Lucky,and Me against the music were what really displayed her talent in the new millenium.I like her new techno/dance style,but I miss the simple and sexy pop that got her to where she is today.|`|80II1Wv1aa	I did then, yeah.

jDxlLbBzaa	I agree. Too many awards going to Slumdog because, I think, people are choosing it for the fairy-tale story of the films success rather than on the actual technical merits of the film itself. <br>  <br>  Sound mixing? Over Wall-E and Dark Knight? And yes, the music in Wall-E was so much better. Definitely better original score. <br>  <br>  But sadly, it looks like Slumdog is going to sweep all the categories it was nominated for. Sad. It doesn't deserve all of them.|`|W84gB7FYaa	Agreed.|`|AA11139702	Wall - E  IS the best movie!|`|44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	Yep I agree on that one, at least best original song!!! <br>  Slumdog Millionaire was pretty good in every sense, but this is just too much...<br>  <br>  This is becoming very predictable already: it will win Best Picture, I bet 100 on it!!!!  lol<br>  Let's see...<br>  -------------<br>  See? Told ya :)

xqrwDmyUaa	To those who said Taken wasn't eligible, why wouldn't it be it is in theaters right now the same as many of the other nominated films are, it's also listed as a 2008 film as they are. Taken isn't Oscar material that's why it wasn't there, that doesn't mean it wasn't a good film but the Academy looks for a certain type of film to win, if you watch the Oscars for years and years you notice this. Taken quite obviously was not even made to win awards, some directors make films they want to win and some just make films for people to enjoy, Taken is the latter.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Well, first off, Taken isn't even eligible.  It came out in 2009... tonight's awards are for 2008 movies.  Second, Taken really wasn't very good, so I wouldn't count on it getting nominated for anything next year.|`|DFrzrmiDaa	LOTR is far better than Titanic or Benhur.|`|80II1Wv1aa	LOTR only got 11 when you add up all three movies|`|7HEZhx46aa	Taken just came out this year. It will be eligible for NEXT year.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Besides Titanic and LOTR the only other movie to win 11 Oscars was "Ben Hur" an old movie from 1959.

Seriously, every time I see them I want to rip off my shirt and do something manly. And this is coming from a girl's perspective!! Between the daily drama of the high school idiots and the surmountable boringness of ordinary life, a good fantasy is a great break. Especially one that has Viggo in it. Even if you're male you can appreciate that, only cause he's so damn snazzy (in a cool way). <br>  If you're into movies, try Count of Monte Cristo (I liked it, some didn't, I did) or the Dark Crystal (probably the lamest movie you will ever watch, but it remains up on my top five). <br>  Action is the way to go!!|`|9MAgrGAMaa	Right now it's Twilight :P<br>  But before Edward Cullen stole my heart ...<br>  <br>  Interview with a Vampire<br>  Wild Hearts can't be Broken<br>  Con Air<br>  Queen of the Damned <br>  Shawshank Redemption and <br>  The Notebook.<br>  <br>  Hope you can get some good vids to watch.<br>  <br>  FYI - go to <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a> and type in a movie you enjoy.

Your comparing apples to oranges.<br>  <br>  The All Star teams are determined by fan vote.<br>  The People's Choice Awards are also determined by fan vote.<br>  <br>  That's apples to apples.<br>  <br>  The Oscars are determined by fellow film makers.  I'm not into sports, but do they have some kind of award that is determined by teammates and such?  If so, it is the equivalent of the Oscars and makes it also apples to apples.

PF6yKkVDaa	I don't know why people are giving the thumbs down to playing real drums. it's a fact, there's more drums on most drum sets, like a 7 or 9 piece set, and the pedals probably have a greater tension, which gives you more resistance therefore burns calories quicker. I don't doubt you can burn calories by playing the rock band drum set, but on the same note real drums will burn more calories so just ignore the thumbs down because people that play rock band think it's an insult if people tell you to play real instruments, even though it's a lot more respectable to be a good DRUMMER than a good ROCK BAND drummer.|`|JThgHiaoaa	Yes you can... definately not as much as going for a jog but its better then sitting there watching TV.<br>  <br>  I agree with the above posters that real instruments are better but disagree with their attitudes. P.S. a real set of drums are expensive and make a lot of noise. Rock Band creates a small amount of noise with the volume at a reasonable level and doesn't break the band at the >$500 mark.|`|HGnWKRzyaa	Well, I would consider it cardio. You burn calories by sitting alone and the extra movement is burning even more.<br>  <br>   Imagine how Neil Peart must feel after shows...|`|oUZLZusjaa	You burn calories just by breathing. You burn more calories by actually playing real drums. Get a real instrument (not just a piece of plastic) or get lost, poser. You wouldn't have to mention the swelling of your fingers if you had any real talent.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	You'd burn a lot more calories on real drums buddy

We said that if we dyed her hair purple and stuffed her with twinkies, he wouldn't like her anymore. So we always screamed "PURPLE HAIR AND TWINKIES" whenever we walked past her. Turns out she's starting to gain weight and wants to get her hair dyed purple. He likes me now. :D

Z5mmaFK0aa	I have been playing forever. 17 or more years.<br>  <br>  I started when I was 15 years old and started with Iron Maiden covers. I was playing Maiden perfectly after 6 months. After a year I had learned and memorized all the Randy Rhoads solos. After a year and a half I discovered Yngwie Malmsteen. By 2 years I was playing as fast as Yngwie but didn't have near the taste or phrasing skills as Yngwie. I had the technique and skills but no Vibrato or Taste. When I was 18 I went to GIT in Hollywood and studied under Paul Gilbert and Bruce Bouillet before anyone even really knew who the hell they were. I got all into Shrapnel Record artists. <br>  <br>  By the time I was 19 I was shredding in my first band that I co-founded but still had no Vibrato or no taste. By the time I was 23 I finally got some phrasing skills and Vibrato skills. I have been playing off and on in bands since then and working as a studio musician. <br>  <br>  I am trying to put something new together in the technical death metal genre but I am disgusted with the apathy of todays musicians and just lack if interest in doing something technical with skill. I am over all just disgusted with the lack of interest or concern period in the underground metal music scene. so I am fixing to call it a day and just learn drum programing and do it for fun. I am already a successful business man with a nice home so whatever I was hoping for this project to take off but from what I have seen I am starting not to give a sh**.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Bro with regard to GIT today I have no idea. I have not heard anything with the way its ran today. Back then it was a really good school. I didn't go that long either I went and did like a 4 to 6 month program enough to cram in a bunch of techniques and Music Theory.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Well I'm not good good. I can play most thrash/groove rhythm and some soloing. I've been playing for a little over a year. I think thats when you start to get respectable|`|pc5uxwTBaa	I'm not really that good, in fact I have a song called "I Suck At Guitar" (which is more of a joke). But I can no doubt write and play hardcore punk, and at that I am not bad if not pretty good. I have been playing for 2 months, people do say I am a fast learner (I can learn an entire Misfits song in 15 minutes).|`|oUZLZusjaa	Depends how you define "good". Is it good like being able to play "Master of Puppets" all the way through or good like BEING Kirk Hammet good? Cuz your skills will constantly improve forever as long as you practice, you'll learn new techniques, etc. Generally about a year until you'll notice you're getting faster, sounding better, etc. and you'll notice yourself getting better after that. As far as becoming as good as The Nuge or Hammet or anyone like that, you'll need quite a few years under your belt for that.|`|QyDo2pOYaa	people will respect your guitar playing skills and think you are good if you can play a few good songs all the way through. That usually takes a few months(about 2 or 3) but after you learn a couple of songs, it begins to get easier to play, and also you will be able to play songs by ear instead of looking up tabs.
svYiQZUHaa	I would become famous by becoming a writer. I use to be a violinist just practice and sign up for classes and competitions.|`|c6oobrlAaa	Probably murdering someone then becoming a famous serial killer. xD|`|ldYCWuXMaa	Well firstly, you have to get an agent and be at auditions for a band, or play, or etc. Your agent will be in charge of the money you earn and finding an audition for you. You have to have good grades, school will be included if you do become famous. Little by little, your playing at musical or something will be discovered. Then maybe if you're really good they'll put you in the orchestra.

So excited!!!|`|YgzpSbxdaa	Which one, because i've already seen the first one.|`|k6M48eUMaa	DVD Release dates:<br>  <br>  USA - 21st March 2009<br>  Australia - 22nd April 2009
AA12093934	The lead singer was an alcoholic or something like that and he wrote it about what happened to him.........<br>  <br>  <br>  idk if that's true but that's what I understand from the lyrics|`|5zwcnmOIaa	It means the lead singer is actually a dog inside a human body yet the band is still better than the jonas brothers.|`|ebxwADDcaa	basically it means "i have become a bag of sh*t, someone help me"
Lw1pOMjwaa	For those who think there will not be a 4th, there actually will be. I saw a site about auditions for it a while back but I can't find it now, sorry. Apparently the film will centre on Rocketman, Donny and Tiara. I just googled it and it came up with a fair amount of sites so if you want more info/verification give it a go.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by cast goodbyes?|`|DhkGnzJCaa	there is going to be a HSM4 with the people that represent them in the third movie.. i know this cause i saw an audition for extras on a disney website.|`|LcpUdY1gaa	High school musical is so cheezy omg. And also it was SENIOR YEAR. Last movie. Well I heard they were thinking about another one (throws up) but you know. Just wait and see|`|W84gB7FYaa	Ehm... the HSM theme has been High School and the 3rd one was their "SENIOR YEAR" at High School so no more High School for them which means no HSM4 for us.|`|3Bic8KM4aa	there will be a hsm4 but it wont be coming out for awhile until they think of charecters an get different ppl|`|kEqygf1gaa	i dont know your first question but no they are not making a 4th|`|0947e3ec7f569b16160b4d118918524baa	They introduced the younger characters (Tiara Gold, Donnie Dion and  Jimmie Zara)  in HSM3 so that they can go ahead and do a 4th - if they do it will go to the Disney Channel, not in theaters.  But it is still just being discussed, not definite.

Although I hear it does have some disturbing moments. Not disturbing bloody, but disturbing poverty and despair. That being said, it's considered by many film critics as one of the best movies of '08. It seems like a pretty safe bet that it'll be good.|`|F8x36rrSaa	Gory? there aren't any gory scenes expect this one scene but it 's not even worth mentioning.There were like shooting and and stuff but i wouldn't can it gory<br>  <br>  Slum dog was sooooooooooooo good!!!!!!!.

g9TxgMlwaa	Is this a serious question?!  Are you kidding me?? It's not oscar worthy. It's a pop-culture movie that was made to make some money. I have read the books and yes I have seen the movie. It was ok. It wasn't that spectacular. Even my 9 year old daughter wasn't too impressed with that movie. It was delivered with mediocre style and acting.  It jumped around and was rushed. You would only understand the movies if you read the books. And even then it was sketchy. It was okay as entertainment. But Oscar worthy?!  Don't make me laugh|`|D4eFh7Qlaa	i bet twilight is gonna be nominated for mtv awards..|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	lol because its a great movie for fans, but its certainly not oscar worthy! are you kidding?<br>  <br>  Seriously, I'm a HUGE Twilight fan, but its CLEARLY not even close to being oscar worthy. pretty low budget, not very good acting, and the story line is good, but not great. Sorry, for a movie, it wasn't great. I LOVED it, but its not great lol.|`|hCqJMe9xaa	I have no idea why it wasn't. It was sooo good. I love that movie, and the books. It definately should have got nominated for something, imso upset that it didn't. But at least Rob got to present something and well I'm still waiting for Kristen to come out. So that's something to look forward too. By the way Rob looked soooo smokin hot today. ;)|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Twilight was great to me too, but not Oscar material. Usually those films are deeper in meaning and in setting, scenes...everything. Twilight is not made like that. More prestigious films are always nominated.|`|4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	Please. The actors were mediocre at best and the entire story was nothing of great significance to anybody aside Female teens and tweens|`|80II1Wv1aa	You cannot be serious. It's a teen girl movie. NOT EVEN Oscar caliber!|`|C3zybM5vaa	If you actually compare Twilight to let's say, Slumdog Millionaire, you can see a huge difference in the storyline, cinematography, and actors. Sorry to say, but Twilight was just another mediocre movie for the tween masses to drool over, especially for that Edward Cullen guy. It's a type of movie that will most likely be nominated for an MTV Movie Award or Nickelodeon's Kids Choice Award. Sorry to say, but it is definitely NOT Oscar worthy.|`|YgzpSbxdaa	Without mention of the books or cast, part of the reason is it was too much of a low budget film. If you compare it to say the movie 'Australia' that had Nicole Kidman in it, it missed out on being nominated because it didn't sell as well in the cinemas as they hoped, hence it was seen as less popular and less worthy of an Oscar. And that was a 'big' budget film.|`|wg2Zmy4Paa	It definitely should not been. <br>  Glad it wasn't. <br>  most lines came from the book.....<br>  book was good. <br>  <br>  the movie was very poorly directed and a huge disappointment. <br>  i liked it. i really did. <br>  but i liked the book WAY more <br>  and also feel that it shouldn't have been nominated for an oscar <br>  <br>  :]|`|CXwFKBvGaa	It's horrible, so I think that would be why it wasn't nominated for any Oscars.<br>  You see, the Academy chooses GOOD films to nominate.|`|w2Dui70Faa	It would never get nominated because it's a crappy movie. If you think Twilight was great, you haven't seen good films.|`|X6HUimEFaa	I personally never saw it.|`|9jNsEAFGaa	I know i luv that movie. + robs hot.|`|idEETS9laa	Are you serious??<br>  <br>  That movie was a train wreck!<br>  <br>  The acting was boring, the directing was horrid, the music choice was...wtf, it didn't flow, it had unecessary scenery shots.<br>  <br>  Nothing about it was worthy of my 9$ to see it, nevermind an Oscar.<br>  <br>  I did like the books though, but, even as a fan, you have to admit, it's just a book for you readers in an amateur, easy-to-read style. It could never become anything besides a popular thing until the next hot thing shows up.|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	Because it was a sub-paar movie at best. The cinematography was not good, the acting was blah, and most of the movies you see on the oscars, besides the documentaries, have a lot of money to make the movies the best they can be...which Twilight did not have the privelage of having.|`|e84edc9acb02bb655cb07cfc994911adaa	Don't get me wrong, I love the series and Stephenie Meyer, but the movie....so bad.

I went insane when it wasnt there it actually made me mad haha. It was such a popular movie i don't know why they wouldnt nominate it.

fccca38c490bdd7e3c600c513e05cad9aa	Since I was interested in the series as well, I headed over to Amazon Japan to see what they had to say. Search reveals 11 volumes thus far, the latest having a publishing date of 26 June 2008. A little more digging shows that their Volume 10 came out sometime in August of 2007, Volume 9 on 24 October 2006, and Volume 8 on 25 March 2006.<br>  <br>  So it seems that the manga is either still ongoing or recently finished; if the former there may be delays between chapters give that the tankobon were coming out at a fairly steady rate until 2006. <br>  <br>  As for the English version, Volume 9 was supposed to come out on 14 October 2008 according to Chapters-Indigo's website. But they also list the publisher as HarperCollins, not Tokyopop as it was for the others in the series. It could be that Tokyopop gave the publishing contract to HC and HC in turn is delaying it, or Tokyopop still has the contract and has delayed it, or Ecole was pushed aside into limbo and postponed indefinitely. I really hope none of those is the case, so let's just cross our fingers and hope someone upstairs gets their act together.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. I've been waiting for ADV to put out new Gunslinger  Girl GNs forever - Japan's got up to Volume 10 and we're stuck at 6 - so I know how frustrating it can be. Cheers!
MlraNN6Maa	Either Grade 5 or Grade 6.<br>  <br>  In Grade 5 I was an early bloomer and was the first girl in my class to get my period. SO AWKWARD. I was continually bombarded questions by all the girls.<br>  <br>  In Grade 6, which was of course the last grade of elementary school and the beginning of junior high, was also ridiculously awkward. It was a bunch of 12 year olds afraid of a huge step forward in their lives and unsure of what to hold on and what to let go. Like, now that you're almost 13, should you still be doing this or that? The result was a bunch of hormonally imbalanced, messed up kids.|`|9BbV2xqIaa	probably grade 5. I had just moved to Canada in May, just before the year ended. couldn't speak English properly and had nearly no friends when the year was done. :/<br>  <br>  not that I even mind being friendless. just back then I did, a bit. and it was so awkward because I could understand what they were saying about me, I just didn't know how to respond and tell them to shut the hell up.|`|cwECvASBaa	yes|`|nr96BgWfaa	6th - i was too mature for my age and had high schoolers coming onto me.|`|2bdb725f7855917a29b72ddc415a5b57aa	2nd grade because i don't remember it lol.

(S1)<br>  <br>  "You are going to tell me everything I want to know or I <br>  swear to God I will hurt you before I kill you, and no one<br>  will be able to stop me." (to Nina in S2)<br>  <br>  "You have no idea how far I'm willing to go to acquire <br>  your cooperation." (S3)<br>  <br>  "Drop the coffee." (S6)<br>  <br>  "Show me your head."

But the first time I took my truck drivers test, we found out the tester person didn't even HAVE a truck drivers license and it was illegal for me to be driving the truck without a licensed truck driver in the passenger seat.  And he had the nerve to fail me!  The next time, I took an even HARDER test and passed it easily.  What a hole!<br>  <br>  When my uncle took his road test many years ago, the tester dude told him to pull over and stop the car.  He got out and said "You fail".  Apparently, he ran stop signs, almost ran into another car and caused an accident.  THere was talk of a person crossing the street, but I never did get the whole story on that.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Not the road, the paper test... When they told me the first time (I was 30 something) I was like, "No!!!" And my boyfriend didn't help by chastizing me. The night before, I chose to watch tv... and he told me, "See...I told you, you should have studied." (He was nuts about getting me to get my license..)<br>  <br>  When I took the road test, all the woman had to say was, "Well, you have passed--" I didn't even hear whatelse she said because I was too busy SCREAMING AND CRYING....hehe|`|Fyt8uQexaa	i farted it was so akward..lol..<br>  he look at me stupid.lol|`|Onh6soTEaa	Nope, although when i took my road test there was this one girl (She was kinda slow) that failed because she almost hit someone...and it was her 6th time taking it LMAO.

The instructor told me to start the car, so I started the car, then he immediately failed me b/c I didn't check my mirrors. I said to him you just told me to start the car, I was going to check the mirror before pulling off anyway. But he didn't care, maybe he didn't get laid the night before, who knows...|`|q1Va2WCnaa	I failed it the first time when I went over the curb trying to parallel park. I live in a very rural area, and had never parallel parked before practicing for the test...and in the 16 years since I got my license I haven't parallel parked once.|`|RaBflUE0aa	almost. i'm aloud to miss 15 points and i missed 14... lol<br>  i don't have a funny story... =(<br>  but i almost crashed on the way out of the dmv parking lot|`|QW3bhMQRaa	I failed 2 times...1st time I pulled out in front of another car at a two way stop. 2nd time I ran a red light.|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	Dude, if you failed your driivng test, you shouldn't drive at all.  Just grab a taxi bro|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes. During my first test, I did a rolling stop at the stopsign which was obstructed by trees. Then I was asked to park on the side of the road (not parallel parking) and I thought that meant just stop and I didn't turn off the engine or put it into park. I told her afterward I didn't know what she meant by that but she was nice about it. The second time around was easy and I passed with flying colors.|`|ch3cnSTzaa	I've failed my twice. In the wonderful state of NJ the troopers actually do the road test with you. Well, we started with all the parking stuff and that went well. Now it was time to get on the road. I pulled out of the facility and went down the road. The trooper looked at me and said we will take a left turn onto the street after the railroad crossing. Okay sounds fine. Well, the railroad tracks are uphill from the road and you can't tell where the street begins until you on the other side. Needless to say I crossed over the tracks and went a little too far. I was supposed to turn immediately and was almost pass the street (that's how close the street was to the tracks). I tried to back up a little so I could make the left turn when this 6'4" monster of a trooper began swearing at me with every possible word he could think of. He told me to pull over and get my a** over on the passenger side. This was only cause I backed up slightly to make the turn. And there was no traffic behind. Sad to say he did scare the hell out of me and I cried all the way back to the testing station where my 4'11 mother got in this officers face and told him where he could get off at talking to a child like that. She press charges against him for his improper behavior.<br>  <br>  The second failure was three months later. I had a different trooper. This was one was a lady trooper and boy was she hot. Brunettes, yeah baby! Yeah, we never made it out of the parking lot. How was I to know it was improper to hit on a female officer. My mom dropped the charges on the other officer so that I wouldn't get arrested for hitting on the officer. It's not like I was offering her a bribe.....just a date after I got my license. I'm not quite that bold anymore with the ladies. Nothing like getting handcuffed in front of your mother to change the mood.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	No, I passed my first time :)|`|lILfQh6xaa	the first time i did. I had to back around a corner and park. I had to drive it backwards, and go around a corner, and then park.|`|KkRb3paPaa	yes! i failed it 3 times, 1st time when i was 16, 2nd when i was 26 and 3rd when i was 36. but i don't really remember all that since i'm 13 :D|`|CEKZsoFRaa	No way, just the computer test once!|`|hCRxXDFgaa	No, but I did get points off my test for poor use of gears.... i was driving an automatic|`|FCFQRAvCaa	The first time they wouldn't let me take it because the car didn't have a front license plate. So, we went in and applied for temporary plates. Got back in line, and, while I was waiting, the car overheated. Steaming all over the place. Very embarrassing. Just went home. Went back the next day and took the test and passed.|`|TJHxVwrpaa	no|`|MyVtwtOnaa	yeah..i'm 21 and still don't have my license...couldn't parallel park|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes indeed.  The first time I took the test I flunked.  He told me to turn left and there was a sign and I made good turn but I knacked the sign over.  After that I got stock with the garbage truck and I did not know what to do and I stay to long behind the truck, well, while I was waiting he was taking all the points.  Thank God I tried again and I passed with 98 and when they sent my picture I was with my eyes closed, it look as if I were sleeping. he he  <br>  <br>  The funny thing is that I told this incident to my friend so she would not make the same mistake.  She went to take the test and there was one men standing close to her and she took off like an airplane and almost smashed his feet.  She feels so confidence and she still driving with only one hand. She flunked the test from the beginning.  The poor men was lucky that day.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	i failed the exam part<br>  one question<br>  " A blind man is about to walk across the street. He puts his walking stick down on the road, but then puts it back up. What do you do?"|`|jeZmqhNcaa	I hit a parked car in the parking lot before I even got to the road, the guy was super old, and didn't notice so I just kept going, but i failed anyway...|`|GomB6c83aa	nope. i remember i was so nervous that my right leg started shaking so badly that i kept pressing on and off the gas therefore making the car shake

Cb5N6UaQaa	Burn After Reading<br>  George Clooney<br>  Brad Pitt<br>  John Malkovich<br>  Frances McDormand<br>  Tilda Swinton<br>  Richard Jenkins<br>  David Rasche<br>  J.K. Simmons<br>  <br>  I just can't get much better than that. Pretty much every movie that Malkovich makes is star studded.|`|JtXuvZLzaa	I'd say Ocean's 11 had a pretty star studded cast.|`|oMNHPDEvaa	The Royal Tenenbaums had an incredible cast. That just popped into my head right off the bat. There is definitely many more movies out there with incredible casts, other than The Departed and The Godfather, sadly, none that I can think of at the moment.
xqrwDmyUaa	I like Brad Renfro, just thought I'd throw that in there since we are talking about actors dying too young. He was in The Client, Apt. Pupil and Bully, he also has a new movie coming out soon, The Informers, Renfro died right before Ledger. I think people are completely forgetting about him.<br>  <br>  Between Ledger and Phoenix I am going to go with Ledger, purely because I prefer his films. Most people do forget about Phoenix you are right about that, I am old enough to have been a fan and around to see the reports when he died.|`|KLRQqVWfaa	Ughh I am so sick of this....he is NOT overrated because of his death. He is/was an amazing actor i am so tired of people mocking him....ok "your not" but you should see some of the things i read|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I liked them both and thought they both had some great acting bits in several movies. They aren't comparable and both had a different style. Neither of them are overrated at all. Joaquin is much better than River, so I don't know what you're talking about.|`|u8Ts3Nxbaa	River Phoenix is an exceptional and remarkable actor, whom we lost too soon. He had so much protential, I am sad just thinking about what he could have done or have had taken his actiing career.. and dont forget that fact that he was gorgeous!<3|`|U1chPjvPaa	You can like them both, its not a contest. You can like one more than the other, they won't care.|`|FYhGTJ29aa	In my opinion, the tragedy has nothing to do with the appreciation for his work. His death would haven't been as emphasized if it wasn't for the appreciation of his work. Also, I do not believe that the quality of a movie necessarily equates to the quality of a performance. There have been outstanding performances in terrible movies, and the reverse is also true. Besides all of that, Heath Ledger's death was recent, while River Phoenix's was back in 1993. Many of Ledger's fans are in their teens and may have never even heard of River Phoenix.

This a joke I heard when I was in the Army...a long time ago.<br>  There are a lot of hand motions that I will try to describe.<br>  <br>  On the fence line in Cuba there are two guards facing each other across the fence about 100 yards apart. The American guard gets bored and wants to try to talk to the Cuban on the other side. He decides to ask him what his military specialty is. So he waves his arms to get the guys attention. The points up in the sky and arcs his hand down ward, asking "are you Airborne?" The Cuban ignores him. So then the American waves at him again, and holds his hand up and mimes walking with his fingers, asking "are you Infantry?" The Cuban glares at him, but still doesn't move. Next the American starts swinging his arms at one side in an upward arc, asking "are you Artillary?" The Cuban is starting to get angry now, but still tries to ignore the ugly American. Finally the American puts his hands up by his eyes and thrusts them in and out, miming binoculars, asking "are you in Intelligence?" At this point the Cuban lifts his rifle and shoots the American right in the head, killing him.<br>  When the Cuban authorities are questioning him the Cuban guard said that he HAD to shoot the American, as he told him that when the sun went down [airborne] he was going to walk over there [infantry] and boink him [artillary]until his eyes popped out! [intelligence]<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped a little.<br>  Cheer up or the blue bird of happiness will take a dump on your house!|`|67dWrrH9aa	Okay so this one time me and my friends invited 100 people to go to the local mall.

(The screen was off because they were replacing it.) I hadn't anticipated how high the actual frame was...so my foot hit the bottom and I fell flat on my face through the door onto tile floor. I layed there for about 3 full minutes. EVERYONE laughed so hard that they didn't even think to ask me if I was ok.<br>  <br>  Joke: Why are black people so tall? Because their knee-grows.

A lot of people are going to say well screw him...but if he really makes you happy and your argument is not worth breaking up over, then swallow your pride and call him. If you did something wrong, apologize. If he was the wrongdoer...explain to him why you got upset. Find a way to work it out. Either way, if he really cares about you, I'm sure your effort to call him and talk things out will be enough to put you two on speaking terms again.|`|0R8g7K2uaa	Well happy Birthday =]<br>  <br>  here are some of my favorite videos<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVblWq3tDwY&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVblWq3tD...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYG...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtilWL4mnhI&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtilWL4mn...</a><br>  <br>  the last one is really cute<br>  <br>  and the first 2 ones are funny =]|`|AA10462002	Well first off happy birthday :-)<br>  <br>  And yeah guys are jerks, plain and simple.  Don't let him get to you.  If it was a stupid petty issue, wait until tom. when you're both calmer, and call him up tom. and you'll both probly laugh over it.<br>  <br>  If it was something major, he was cheating on you, or lied to you about something serious, than stop the fighting and just kick his a$$ to the curb....  yeah it sux, and you'll cry over it, and you'll be lonely, etc. but in the long run you know it's the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  Either way, it sux to have arguments esp with someone you love and on your birthday, even worse.  But unfortunately it happens.  You're not the first, and you won't be the last.  Just do your best to enjoy the rest of your day.<br>  <br>  Idk where you live, here it's almost 1am...  but in cali or something it's not even 10 yet.... SO if it's still early enough maybe call some of your girls and have a nice girls night out... If you're old enough go clubbing or to a bar...  IF you're still in your teens maybe have a fun sleepover, rent a few dvd's, pop some popcorn... Oh yeah I'm forgetting it's a schoolnight....   Well either way, even go out to dinner or something.... Anything to get your mind of things...

The entirety of the turn though, the force of it, is caused by the movements of your arms, which start out straight, (i turn to the left) so I keep me left arm in front of me, a bit to the right, bent at a 90 degree angle about to the right, and my right arm out to the side straight. When I jump, I bring both in front of me, and keeping them like I have a circle in front of me.

eqJiIQGeaa	Dean Razorback DB Electric Guitar looks awesome... and Dimebag hisself designed it... You got to get it.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Well none of those are really my style. I prefer Ibanez I have for a very long time because my favorite guitar player has always played them. Paul Gilbert. I have an Ibanez RG321MH with the Ibanez chiseled style Strat Body I have always preferred the Strat body design.  <br>  <br>  I don't use Tremolo Systems I have an average bridge because I drop tune in many different tunings and it got to be a pain setting up for each time I wanted to drop tune. I also didn't even use the Bar that much so why bother? I mean Floyd Rose is nice but not worth it when I am drop tuning all the time.<br>  <br>  So if I had to pick out of those I would go Jackson hands down|`|9hFexadLaa	definitely the last one, Dimebag did good with it|`|SazPJ3iKaa	Its up to you and your amp.

0hT85XLzaa	I'm just glad Slumdog Millionaire won.|`|hd442Ha5aa	I didn't watch Slumdog Millionaire but Gosh! I was annoyed that they won everything. Maybe they deserved it, I don't know but it would've been great to have some variety on the show!|`|EC2TSFj3aa	I wish I had puked all over Slumdog. I was happy Kate Winslet won.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Pretty much, yes. It was nice that Kate Winslet and Sean Penn won. And even nicer that Brad and Angie did not. LOL|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I think Slumdog was one of the greatest films of the last few years. It was really well put together. Yes, I'm glad it won most of the awards.
8Mi15cTtaa	it was the subject matter of the movie. The Oscar was a political statement.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn should have kept politics out of the Oscars. His comments were insulting. I will never go to a Sean Penn movie!!!|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	Because he is a good liberal...I have never seen a sean penn movie I liked. He wasn't even a good pot head|`|rKQ9l81kaa	I totally agree with you. I thought Rourke was going to get it. He deserved it. I mean he completely lost everything and literally scratched and crawled his way back up. No one in Hollywood is ever able to do that but he did.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn probably got it for one reason...I'm not saying this because I have a problem against homosexuals because I don't I'm in support of gay rights and everything but I think the reason he got it is because Hollywood loves those types of music that have to do with homosexuality. I loved the movie "Milk" but I just think that Rourke deserved it more.|`|APFfyjsaaa	You know whats funny? People come on here and talk about gay rights, prop 8, etc.. They then state it is hard for an actor to play a gay man if he isn't gay? <br>  <br>  Is that a stereotype? Are gay men different and easily noticeable?<br>  <br>  You libs kill. Always talking out of both sides of your mouth. Mickey Rourke was better because I will never watch Milk. I know the story and do not need a Hollywood "based" on a true story. Milk was not effeminate as Sean Penn portrayed him to be. Another stereotype.|`|bB3f4duZaa	He won because he was playing a gay character.  Seems to be the trend lately.  Play the gay, win the award.  If he hadn't, they would be crying discrimination against gays...we can't have that now, can we?|`|OURb1rnTaa	many say rourke was only playing himself.|`|FiUDqsrLaa	I didn't see either movie.  But based on what I know about them:  It would be harder for a straight man to play a gay man than it would be for a wrestler to play a wrestler.|`|70ikN5TYaa	This is hilarious.  There will be other times for him to win.  You have to understand that this is a popularity vote.

7y7t04Vsaa	There are too many choices to pick the worst one of all but one of the worst was when I was on a swings with my girlfriend at the time. We were swinging and then she got pissed off about something I said of course and got off the swing and started walking away. Well I wanted to stop her, so I jumped off my swing when it was up very high. As soon as I was in the air I knew it was not going to end so well, I was saying to myself OH SH*T. I was flying in a position like Superman and I landed face down in the dirt. I was mostly embarrassed though because there was several people there watching the whole thing and they were all like "OH MY GOD!!! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!?" and started running over to me and that made it 10x worse!!!|`|YTLePvkVaa	i got out the pool and my penis was hanging out my boxers and everyone was laughing cause i didnt notice till like 5 mins later.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	My bikini top fell off in the pool, in front of several people, including 2 guys I knew from school.

w2Dui70Faa	No, I was rooting for Mickey Rourke to win Best Actor. I was also disappointed "The Wrestler' got home empty-handed.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Yes and no.  I wanted Milk to win Best Picture, but 'Slum Dog' won instead.  I wanted Sean Penn to win Best Actor, and he did.  I liked the 'scaled back' show due to our 'bad economy' and actually liked the fact that the show didn't go on and on and on and on as it has in previous years.  I really loved the 'five past winners' who made the major presentations ... such 'class' was never seen so clearly, nor such diversity.  I found the 'musical montage' too confusing for words, and was glad when it ended ... but I also liked that the man who won for 'original score' then sang two of the songs nominated ... he seemed to be 'lost' up there, but did try hard (and his song won, but two songs from one show were up against only one other song from an animated movie) ... and best and happiest of all, my husband and I can make it to bed on time and not 'miss' any of the 'big awards.'  And by the way, I was in one room, watching the Oscars, while my husband went into a different room to watch Amazing Race ... which we always watch on Sunday when it's on ... and we 'reported back' now that both are over.  Be happy about things that truly matter to you, and have a good night!|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	I thought the Academy fell all over themselves for Slumdog Millionaire.  A lot of good performances and films got overlooked.|`|2459e32a987a49305280c9a12e43c44caa	Yes and No.<br>  Hugh Jackman was nice eye candy and the man could sing and dance, they really did not need to add Beyonce or those 2 talentless idiots from High School muscials.  And too much Slumdog Millionaire for me, some of those technical and editing awards could have went to those action films.  Yay for Kate Winslet finally winning one, but Boo for the Sean Penn win.  Too much, I'm sorry for Proposition 8 crap in there, Mickey Rourke sad struggling wrestler should have won it.  And I would not watch Slumdog even after the sweep.  Sorry, I am NOT a fan of those Bollywood movies at all.  JAI HO for best song??? That is not something I would download into my IPod.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	The oscar telecast has lost something...it was fine tonite, but I haven't really loved the oscars since Billy Crystal hosted.He was one of the funniest and best host ever.

er9g9wHXaa	I cannot believe that Rourke didn't win. Milk is a terrific and important film, but that Sean Penn's Oscar win is completely unwarranted. Rourke's performance has stuck with me like few movie characters ever have and I truly believe that it was worth all of the hype and then some. Also, I believe that Sean Penn incorporated too much of is character from I Am Sam into his Harvey Milk performance. If you see footage of the real Milk, Sean Penn did look like him but did not act like him at all.<br>  Mickey Rourke was robbed.|`|3e46aef76b1fb84d0ce11d48fc610f4faa	Today you have to be a hard-core America hater to win. Mind you, not liberal, but an America hater. Look at George Clooney, Kevin Spacey, and others who went to Venezuela to praise Hugo Chavez (a guy who killed his biggest rival) the dictator. These guys aren't good actors, but the public wants you to think that they are because in Hollywood (and most Universities) the praise of gutter trash is equivalent to intelligence and ability. But yes, Rourke was robbed. When he made his truthful (Bush was in the wrong place at the wrong time) comment regarding the events of 9/11 and the fall-out the Hollywood elite were against his win. Some may feel that Sean Penn's father was a role model for turning other Jews over to Hitler to save his hide and they will surely agree that he is as well. Once again, this is why I boycott Hollywood freaks.|`|AA12093096	I don't even like wrestling and i absolutley loved "The Wrestler", well to be honest when I was little I did like The Ultimate Warrior, hmm maybe they should make a wrestling movie called the ultimate warrior"! anyway, his performance was awesome, if anything they should have given him an oscar too, lolz.|`|PCbfSSjmaa	I totally, 100%, agree with you.|`|fyQjBUzUaa	Without a doubt, Rourke was robbed.  Absolutely no contest.  None of the other nominees suffered for their art the way he did, and the role couldn't have been more apt.  I think what killed Rourke's chance in the end, was word of his engagement with the upcoming Wrestlemania event.  As dumb as that may sound, I can see members of the Academy no longer believing his commitment to the craft.  Some might consider it as a vote wasted, as if he'll abandon acting for sport, all over again.  I love Penn (even he would have voted for Rourke to win), but he already has a statue and Rourke has never received that level of appreciation from his peers.  To think that some of his early performances were never nominated, continues to boggle my mind.  Just as I think he was robbed for the win, I feel the same about the film not getting nominated for "best picture".  Aronofsky, also.|`|8LNrMMi8aa	Yes , Mickey Rourke was robbed ! I was shocked ! but considering how this was the most boring ,and stale show ever ,was this <br>  a progression of the academy losing their senses or their spitefulness ?<br>  OK , some of the winners did have me in tears , but this does not excuse <br>  the fact Mickey Rourke deserved this Oscar !|`|aQeyVCGvaa	Rourke was totally robbed, even though i love sean penn as an actor, rourke reached into the depths of his soul to come up with the performance in the wrestler and deserved the award.<br>  ******* academy dont like him probably because of his badboy image but then again sean is a bit of a badboy, politics played a huge part i reckon.|`|4owrapECaa	3 Reasons for Rourke getting pick-pocketed:<br>  <br>  1 - Kissing someone of the same sex to the Academy is apparently "stretching" your artistic abilities to their furthest regions....BULL$%^@<br>  <br>  2 - The Academy was most likely scared of what Mick's acceptance speech would be like<br>  <br>  3 - EVERYTHING is about politics these days.  Penn and the Academy wanted to push the so-called "tolerance" agenda a little further down our throats.  I know people were protesting, and of course they're the crazy ones cuz we've been trained to believe what the glamorous people who get paid $20 million to pretend to be someone else for a living have to say.  F*ck off!  <br>  <br>  I do think Penn is a kick *** actor, but that performance of Harvey Milk was just as annoying as his character in I Am Sam.  Rourke should've had this one in the bag.  It takes more guts to play yourself in a movie and let everyone see your flaws and baggage, and let's face it....Rourke was pretty much playing himself, only in a different profession.<br>  <br>  btw...touching on what someone said earlier about even Penn knowing he shouldn't have won.  If you saw his face, that was genuine disbelief when they announced his name.  No matter the reason for the robbery, Sean Penn knew in his heart of hearts that he should NOT have won that Oscar|`|GhtSSKQJaa	This is an example of the stuck up bastards who run the oscars who look down on pro wrestling like it was something that people of low intellegeance watch to see guys get beat up when that couldn't be any further from the truth, wrestling is a passionate, beautiful, yet sometimes underhanded and cut throat industry, like crime, and i can't tell you how many crime movies and actors was awards|`|elMfo4bTaa	Sean Penn had to use all his mind control to focus on what he planned to say if/when he won, as he was in the most utter shock of all of us that he was at that podium rather than Mickey! Proof of this is how at the end, he calls Mick his 'brother' - you know he could not think of anything but Mick the entire time! A 1st degree THEFT of the GRANDEST kind!|`|DUrFZoyHaa	No doubt about it; Mickey Rourke's performance was absolutely brilliant. He completely drew the audience into a world that very little is known about. A real pity that the true winner wasnt recognized.|`|Jmrla2n6aa	YEAH!<br>  <br>  Penn's performance was SO OVERRATED! <br>  <br>  We get it..if you play retard or gay you get an Oscar with the lefty-loosy foundation Hollywood is built on but COME ON! <br>  <br>  Rourke..his "comeback" aside portrayed a picture perfect character.|`|7LWVmXmgaa	Totally robbed. Giving the award to a dope like Penn was just the Academy being its usual political self, putting their pathetic, liberal agenda before actual talent. Even Penn knew it.|`|yKbfkPoeaa	yeah, he was robbed,<br>  he did an incredible performance|`|Y6WKJJdXaa	Heck yea he was. I'm sorry but Mickey Rourke was really ******* good in the The Wrestler. He should have won the Oscar hands down. One more reason why I hate Sean Penn.|`|IsZOdAFXaa	YES!!!|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I agree, I couldn't believe that Sean Penn won. Rourke definitely deserved it more.|`|b7c4e3ddfbe997b4c4590bb3b470d4d6aa	He was robbed. It's just another reason why none of us should take the Oscar's seriously anymore. The award has proved time and time again that it can be bought and Hollywood's ongoing quarrel with "normal" people is at it's peak. So they thought giving the Oscar to a guy who played a pro wrestler was below them? Well I think the Oscar's are below the Teen Choice Awards, and who watches those?  In fact...who cares what these people think? There heads are so far up their own butts its ridiculous. The People's Choice Awards are the only true awards because the people decide, not a bunch of frauds who don't know anything past Los Angeles.

Are you making an observation that fantasy and classical music have inspired many metal musicians? Yes, that is very true, in fact it's to this day one of the defining points of most genres of metal.

Later down the road well look for the dude with the money or has a plan to get money, since most of us like security, and well choose that man to be our spouse.|`|JV0i77uiaa	No, not all girl are like that.  You just happen to fall for the wrong one.  She must be brainless or stupid.  Some guy are like that also, but I can not judge all of them.  I had known some women who brag about going out with guy with money and at the end they regret it.  They ended up with the creepy jerk.  The same thing happen with guys, they have a good woman and cheat on her or bit her.   Those guys/girls ended up along.  If this girl you were dating went with a drunk and smoke all day, you should feel lucky, it's not your lost but her.|`|7OjRAzgEaa	usually we dont mean to, but sometimes it just happens.  usually i dont let myself get in too deep, once i realize the guys a t ool, or a "bada s s ". i know in a lot of cases people want what they can't have, or what they shouldnt have. if someone knows that a pothead wont be best for them, they may want to defy that and that may make the person more attractive-- cause theyre telling themselves they shouldnt have it.|`|AA11865684	No,not all of us go for that type....Its kind of fun to date a guy like that for a while but when it comes to getting serious,I put the brakes on..=)|`|uPzqoXJnaa	no<br>  some girls like girls|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	who said skater dudes are badasses, some of them won't fight at all.|`|35q7VA7Yaa	Other than that they like a man with money.|`|et9gdoDKaa	bada$$ = a$$hole<br>  i don't fall for them|`|fETbCVXbaa	I love the shaggy hair style.

And I was really starting to like him until he told me he was into pot.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I think smoking is absolutely dumb. And I told him that and refuse to date anyone who does such bad things. And I really wish I could find a regular old nice guy who can have fun without doing stupid things.<br>  <br>  So in my opinion, nice guys are waaaaaay better :)|`|LKRWQp4laa	Usually nice girls like bad guys because she never breaks the rules and loves a hot guy that does. get what I'm saying?

AA11588752	Two of my Best Friends are engaged and they are Aquarians.(1 day apart)<br>  I have a few ex boyfriends who are Aquarians and we are all still friends with but I am a Leo.|`|RFQW20Icaa	On Friendship<br>  For me<br>  I really have a lot of them, and really I get along with all of them greatly. We could talk about almost anything and we wouldn't get bored at all (Seriously) Honestly, for me, it's like finding my own personal twins, we all so alike, it's great, because I know I'm not the only weird person around, and that they understand that I need my independence and space because they need their own Independence and space  too. They understand me a lot and it's good to know.|`|8r46d89Vaa	I think Aquarians get along well with most people in general ---- so yes I'd think so.<br>  <br>  My dad's an Aquarius and I don't know one person who doesn't like him.  He's an Aquarius Sun, Aquarius Mercury, and Aquarius Mars.|`|pQGUPITeaa	I'd say in general - yes we do!|`|9tJI0S1Gaa	yes, im aquarian, and my best buddies are aquarius'<br>  <br>  from the very start of our friendship.<br>  we get along so well, and last a very long duration.<br>  only, we sometimes nid an extra time of our owns.|`|XJTynEaMaa	Know your compatibility from the link below alongwith the compatibility with other zodiac signs.|`|n03LF2Jaaa	The Aquarius friend tends to collect friends the way some people put together an eclectic art collection. The typical Aquarian may have so many friends, but very few confidants. Some Aquarians may use this as a way to maintain emotional distance. In general, Aquarius likes a friend who has intellectual interests and enjoys the unusual and the radical. Aquarius will be friendly toward anyone and will tend to regard any relationship as platonic.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Hey ThinNtall, I have Aquarius Sun, Mars, and Mercury too :) No wonder we get along so well lol.<br>  <br>  I get along great with other Aquas. We understand each other's weird sense of humor and we understand each other's need for space and times to ourselves sometimes. I have a best friend that's Aquarius and she lives in Virginia now :( I miss her everyday because she's the only friend that I've had that truly understands and accepts everything about me, mainly because she's so much like me herself. It was always a guaranteed good time when we hung out. We could be serious when the time called for it but total retards when we felt like it. If I felt like just being by myself she totally understood because she would have moments like that herself. Man, I miss that girl :( When Aquarians get together there's like this instant rapport. We just get each other instantly. Other signs find us confusing but to another Aquarius we're really not that hard to understand or even that complicated.
qLvhoRpsaa	If your goal is to get more contacts, get a pic of a hot chick off the internet and use that, and then pass it off as if it were you.<br>  That happens A LOT on here!<br>  You can actually take a pic and "google" search it and you can find it if it is a previously published photo, therefore busting the people that try to use it! Not always, but more often than not. If you know what you are doing.<br>  <br>  I used to go around and bust people who lie and say this is their actual photo, but realized that in itself was sad!<br>  <br>  If they are really that desperate, or that is what they are going for,<br>  Live and let live.<br>  <br>  Douche, I am ok, you're ok! (dripping sarcasm!)<br>  Peace:)|`|67dWrrH9aa	i dunno is that y people added me? i dun think so?|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	only if your beutiful.|`|JU26EGAeaa	IDK1|`|F5Tf0Wowaa	probably it seems like the people with a pic get more fans|`|b7Bos1Zcaa	i think so<br>  <br>  specially if youre hot :]|`|RaBflUE0aa	that depends... are you scary looking? if you are then no, but if you look human then maybe you should test it.|`|p59ib3FIaa	only if your really hot|`|HWYiTOSkaa	idk. what do u look like?|`|dtfnCUwUaa	depends.<br>  <br>  are you hot?
yKEcFtjLaa	Definitely Slumdog Millionaire. That movie was AMAZING!<br>  Madea was alright, but if you want a really good movie, go for Slumdog:)|`|f99361d6fa3f57f25892e40e8f231497aa	B|`|4Wp6R87Kaa	A. Madea Goes to Jail<br>  <br>  Its a movie that every person should see.  It will go down as the greatest movie in the history of cinema.   The movie has and will change Hollywood forever.  Madea Goes to Jail is less a movie, but more a work of art the shows what the human race is capable of.  Madea Goes to Jail is a movie that can bring peace in the middle east, can end world hunger, and stop global warming.  Its is the greatest achievement of mankind.

About 2 mins 30 sec is perfect for popping the most kernels, with the fewest burnt ones.<br>  <br>  Caramel popcorn is the best, but movie popcorn is a close second.

hQtDiKG2aa	I noticed that too- <br>  First off - he brought out a list so he should have had her name on it if it was of any concern. Next - the answer"we'l see how we'll you'll do" doesn;t hold up.<br>  I'm going to win an oscar and I will remember everyone - especially the lady sitting next to me.<br>  <br>  He's a great actor - but can be a real dick. Come home with me Robin.|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	I noticed this - to the point that I "googled" it immediately after viewing on YouTube and found your question.  Sometimes people forget important things, especially when they're nervous.  But in this case, I noticed even BEFORE he omitted his wife's name that when she kissed him "congratulations", he seemed to not give a hoot about her even being there. Maybe they had a fight before the show.  Or maybe he's just self-absorbed.  <br>  <br>  We don't really know the truth.  In any event, it was a mistake.|`|FRE2gov3aa	I noticed that too!<br>  <br>  She kept rubbing his leg while Robert De Niro was about him and she grabbed his face and kissed him when he won,it seemed like he didn't pay any attention to her while the camera was on him.|`|LAhGRwU9aa	i did notice that shame their both great actors|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Lol But, Jenny I love you Jenny! Come on he should have said that would have given Robin Wright Penn a chuckle.|`|RrEc4ykbaa	I noticed that too. Maybe she was mad that her husband stole the award Rourke was supposed to get.

bFI4ZAtjaa	The inspiration will be there from now on, this is the biggest thing for Indian movies and Indian Music.<br>  <a href="http://sphurthy.blogspot.com/2009/02/slumdog-millionaire-wins-8-oscars.html" rel="nofollow">http://sphurthy.blogspot.com/2009/02/slu...</a>|`|7nUhJG41aa	The movie appealed to Americans due to it's wide release and it's dialogue being mostly in English. Indian movies are usually in Hindi. It also had a complex plot that was there less to please the crowd and more to entertain. It also showed a poverty stricken boy in the time of a recession here in America.|`|2oO36b0maa	Didn't watch Oscars, I figured someone would<br>  make a political speech.  <br>  When I heard this movie won, I was glad.<br>  Good for them.|`|C7umw5Vpaa	Agreed.

The problem is of course, that you don't have a job to meet people, are too young to go to bars/clubs, don't want to go to church (don't know a good one, anyways), and don't want to join any clubs with people that you don't know anyways. Hum-mm!<br>  The only good news is that you do have a car, and an interest in having a social life. <br>  Check out the local newspapers, in the personal ad section and see what someone else is looking for. Check out what the city has to offer in the way of sporting events, free activities, (such as Atlanta has free concerts in the park), free movie night under the stars, keep putting applications in all over the city, and talking to the people about your situation and getting any tidbits of info from them, find places that other young people hang out at, and make a bee line for those places. Go to dog shows, the beach ( if that applies), take walks in the park, go to museums, art shows on the street, sales, just get out there, and talk to people that you meet, and they will help you find your way into the social life that you're looking for.<br>  Good luck<br>  Lizzie|`|YIpYrFPnaa	By a big box of cigars, buy some beer, and have a bunch of people over for cards and twister.|`|Th1EmKVtaa	Go to a AA meeting.

wCdILHl6aa	I have NO idea how you can possibly think Hugh was a bad host! I 100% disagree with you...Hugh was one of the BEST hosts the Oscars have seen!!|`|KLRQqVWfaa	HA he was really funny...he isn't a bad singer. Me and my friend were laughing so much.|`|S9jyc95jaa	Nah, I liked him.  Hugh Jackman was entertaining without being crude or over-the-top, and it's not the host's job to try and steal the show anyway, which is why many comedians end up not being very good hosts (which does seem a bit counter-intuitive).  Bill Maher would have been wrong for all those reasons.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	I thought he did fine.  Bill Maher cracks me up, but he has the tendency to get on my nerves too.  You have to realize that they are trying to restructure the whole way the show is produced and what not b/c viewing has been going down and down for a few years now.  They're trying to come up with a better show formula.|`|Gem96NQyaa	In all honesty, he was better than a lot of previous hosts.  I don't think you can get much worse than the year David Letterman hosted.

Next day she tells me her brother said I was cute, next thing I know there is a group date set up for Disneyland, Susie, her brother, my other friend and his boyfriend and two other girls. <br>  <br>  We all decide to have breakfast and the guy stares at my chest during most of the meal. We were all sitting in a round table and he was directly across from me. He tries to flirt with one of my other friends but she doesn't go for it. They all then decide to go inside this spooky tunnel of love type ride, I think it was Nightmare Before Christmas, and guess who my ride partner was? We don't have anything to talk about and by the end of the night I realize that I like Susie better than her brother and I end up feeling like **** and leave early with my other friends.<br>  <br>  I never told Susie about how I felt for her.|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I asked out this girl I didn't know very well, she looked good, but she turned out to be so silent and boring it was horrible. Anytime I would say something funny she just looked at me very serious, and she said like 3 words the whole time we were eating. And so then I figured she was having a bad time so I took her home and before she went in her house, she said something like this, "Wow I never had someone only take me to dinner, usually they take me to a club or something too." I was thinking I don't think I can stand to be bored for another minute like this! She was the most DULL person I have ever met!|`|BgVWSApdaa	I met a guy in person after emailing for awhile.  We met half way between our homes at a restaurant he chose.  <br>  <br>  Right about the time he was supposed to arrive, he called and said he'd be late.  So I waited and waited...  A cute guy and I struck up a conversation and I was thinking that I really would rather have lunch with him.   A whole hour later, my date shows up.  He doesn't look at all like his photo and he is NERVOUS.  He would suddenly start breathing heavily out of the blue and would either run his hand through his hair a few times (which made his hair freak out) or he'd pull on his face a few times as he breathed hard.  I didn't know what to do.  He kept telling me stories about how lonely he was and how girls wouldn't go out with him more than once or twice.  Then he suggested we go walking in a park near there and I thought "There's no way in this world I will get in your car or go to a secluded place with you!"  At the end of our lunch, he blurted out, "So, do you think we have something here?" and I was honest with him but tried to be kind too.<br>  <br>  It actually made me so sad that I cried all the way home.  He was so lonely but his actions would scare any girl off.|`|70NgAfNNaa	he took me out to eat at ***** and to be funny he told the waiters it was my birthday, i was having a realy bad day but he didnt know it yet. i started to cry and he broke up with me cus i was being to emotional.|`|80II1Wv1aa	ugh, one time I got asked out, but I thought that she just wanted to go out as friends and she pounces me in the movie theater out of nowhere!|`|ybWV2ftAaa	my friend hooked me up on a blind date, some female he worked with.

It was sooooo awkward to keep trying to find something to talk about.  It was dinner and a movie with the couple who set us up.<br>  <br>  I find out later from the people who set us up, that she was still hung up on her drug addict ex-boyfriend and wasn't interested in seeing anyone else.  Gee - thanks!!!|`|73ZquQVwaa	i wouldn't know, i haven't been on one yet.

Rourke was my sentimental favorite.  He did a great job; however, the film could have been possibly directed/edited a bit better.<br>  <br>  Penn was fabulous and deserved it.|`|6jZcr33paa	I saw both films and I do like Sean Penn but yeah Rourke deserved that Oscar.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Sean Penn is a great actor and I think he did a great job as did Rourke in Milk. I have followed Penn's career for a while. Now, I think his best ever performance was alongside Pacino in Carlito's Way. Followed by I Am Sam, She's So Lovely, and Racing with the Moon.

kJ80vsVNaa	i went on the 15th and i think i already answered<br>  one of your questions ahaha but uhm during some of the bands<br>  theres a lot of moshing and sometimes people get lifted up to like crowd surf and theres a lot of pushing and shoving around<br>  <br>  and maybe the lead singer, oli might stage dive like he did at the show i was at|`|2jqvVla3aa	It's actually pretty easy to stay out of moshing if you try. Just move out of the way when a pit starts to form. But trust me, it won't take long before you'll want to join a mosh pit, they're just so fun, haha.<br>  BMTH concerts actually aren't that bad though as far as being shoved around. When I went to my first concert, which actually was a BMTH one when I was 13, I tried to stay out of moshing and just moved to the side and danced my way away from any forming one. You can usually just maneuver your way to the front and watch the concert from there, which is what I like to do cause it makes you a lot closer to the band.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and as far as people crowd surfing or if Oli stage dives, just be prepared to catch people, they're not that heavy cause theres like 10 people there to catch them with you.<br>  <br>  But, no matter what happens, I guarantee you'll have the time of your life, Bring Me The Horizon concerts are always absolutely amazing. I hope I helped!|`|XExSxrsIaa	I just went to one last week or something It was the best! Lots of moshing though, so if you're small just try to stay to the side of the stage & also try to make sure you've got a little bit of room to the side of you, b/c some ppl fell when they went crowd surfing & everyone had to scramble to make room for them. Umm.. lets see what else, don't tell your parents too much b/c chances are it will be rough & smell like weed (my concert experience). & just have fun & stay to the side, also having bigger ppl than you on your sides who aren't totally moshing is good. & check online at the Denny's all nighter website to see if BMTH will be at a Denny's after the show so you can go & meet them. Have fun=)
r9u8qEvlaa	I hated this film <br>  Walked out the cinema half way through lol<br>  I dunno why everyone says its so amazing, probably just copy what everyone else says!|`|9YPH1CDfaa	Slumdog is the worst movie to represent Indian film industry. Infect it was foreign film shot in India with use of some Indian baggers as a cast. <br>  <br>  Western world always want to see India as a poor country and all they came to India for focusing poverty. <br>  <br>  Even baggers in India has their OWN slum (Zopda) but in developed country, govt give them houses and support them. in my view, they are more than baggers as they can't survive without them. <br>  <br>  Bollywood hasn't got marketing muscle power as foreign film industries got. it might be the cheapest film ever made in British film industries but they spend more money to market it and get 8 OSCARS.<br>  <br>  out of 8 Oscars, Indian A R rehman got only 2. all other went to the people who has nothing to do with India. <br>  <br>  Talking about A R Rehman, he is the best musician we got these days but Slumdog's music was even below than his average music. think about ROJA,BOMBAY,TAAL,LAGGAN etc. Excellent piece of music he gave. <br>  <br>  I live in outside India from last 4 years but still I support Indian film industry not British film based on just Indian poverty shot in India.<br>  <br>  Bollywood is capable enough to get it’s merits in western world. Hum koi OSCAR ke mautaj nahi. Hume koi certificate nahi chaiye ki hamari films acchi hai. We knew it anyway. <br>  <br>  Keep making good movies for Indians not for foreigners !!|`|Z9u8aQhMaa	slumdog is a movie made, so by showing something that isn't there they can draw attention. This is a common trend in the film industry. This type of movie shows a problem in the society that isnt there. I watched slumdog several times. The music is good (yes because AR is doing it) But the story is a crap. I think slumdog is another typical hindi movie. Im not an indian and there are so many other indian movies i like.|`|V792ArqMaa	I love Slumdog Millionaire. It shows how the Indians feel and hwat problems they face, at least give the Indians a chance on the red carpet and a chance to be heard. I also like it 'cuz it show everyone, not only Indians, that a poor orphaned loser can follow and pursue his dreams no matter what challenges there are.|`|5Np6M8SWaa	Console yourself by thinking that none of the actors associated with this film will ever work again in films that we'll need to be bothered thinking about or seeing.  Then pretend that Danny Boyle won the Oscar for the only good film he's ever made, Trainspotting.  Now, don't you feel better.|`|MLwhrBjgaa	Personally, I don't like the movie. I find it really really cheesy, you know. Like does the dance number in the ending make sense? What's the connection of it in the movie? It's sooo cheesy. Benjamin Button is still the best movie for me so far.|`|UepE3b2Haa	Yes.  But it's the every other year Oscar trend where they give it to the artsy underdog movies.  Grand Tarino should have been up there and a few others.<br>  <br>  And for the don't like it you have to be racist comments, get a life.|`|uJT91cp0aa	I HATE IT AND I'M AN INDIAN<br>  IT DOES NOT DESERVE OSCARS @ ALL<br>  I SPIT ON THIS MOVIE(IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH MY SPIT) HAHAHA...|`|VzzerMvBaa	i thought it was boring, a bit stupid and the whole torture thing was completely unecessary. the story could have been told in the same way with the same effect without that nonsense. and how does a tea boy from the slums know how to use a computer?|`|2ad0abf64be4254deba6da44164e3125aa	I agree that Slumdog Millionaire is the worst movie that wins an oscar.Bollywood is full of these kind of movies.Next year a Chinese film will win.|`|71ac004b72805734898cf56ccd464be5aa	Some of us appreciate good movies, unlike stale minds that watch a movie because their favorite actor/actress is in it.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	I thought it was a good film but it wasn't as good as "The Dark Knight" or "The Wrestler".|`|IbyxsgHhaa	great movie, great depiction of life|`|ZEc4GoGfaa	Slumdog was absolutely amazing; you're just jealous and racist, omg.<br>  <br>  Dark knight was good too; i havent seen the wrestler.<br>  But slumdog was a 'capture your attention' movie.|`|HqcH85SMaa	I didn't think it was a good picture but I never enjoy the movies that have won an Oscar - everybody has different tastes in movies.|`|pUF71f1laa	I couldn't disagree more. What was it that you didn't like about Slumdog. Are you sure we are talking about the same movie?|`|CXwFKBvGaa	It's amazing.<br>  You probably like **** like Twilight, don't you?

But when you are truly in love with someone, it's probably the one thing you can just go on and on talking about, especially with that person. Me and my girlfriend spend hours every night talking to each other on the phone while she is at college and the majority of it is just how much we miss each other and how much we mean to each other.

Y1aAGPURaa	Here are a few that should get them laughing:<br>  <br>  A woman has twins, and gives them up for adoption.  One of them goes to a family in Egypt , and is named 'Ahmal.'  The other goes to a family in Spain ; they name him 'Juan.'<br>  <br>  Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his birth mother. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she also had a picture of Ahmal. <br>  <br>  Her husband responds, 'They're twins!  If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal.'<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>   Mr. Smith, I have reviewed this case very carefully," the divorce court judge said, "and I've decided to give your wife $275 a week." <br>  "That's very fair and more than generous, your honor," the husband said. "And every now and then I'll try to send her a few bucks myself." <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A six-year-old goes to the hospital with his grandma to visit his grandpa. When they get to the hospital, he runs ahead of his grandma and bursts into his grandpa's room. <br>  <br>  "Grandpa, Grandpa!" he says excitedly, "As soon as Grandma comes into the room, make a noise like a frog!" <br>  <br>  "What?" said his grandpa.<br>  <br>  "Make a noise like a frog because Grandma said that as soon as you croak, we're going to Disneyland!!!"|`|zqmy9Qfkaa	Q:What do you do when you see a bleeding clown on your porch?<br>  A:Keep laughing and re-load<br>  <br>  Q:What did the blonde say when she looked in a box of Cheerios?<br>  A: LOOK!

So eventually the man dies and goes to Heaven and asks God, "Why didn't you save me?" and God says, "I sent you two rescue boats, what more did you want?"<br>  <br>  haha|`|45VCb0Qtaa	Here's a funny one..<br>  <br>  A mother had prepared a big dinner with her in-laws.

"Pray about what your mother told you," said the aunt. So the little girl prayed out loud: "Dear God, why on earth did i invite all of these people?"... <br>  <br>  hahaha.. :p hope its ok 4 u..

oUZLZusjaa	GIRLS, HAIR SPRAY, and FIRE.<br>  An in-joke for die-hard MOTLEY CRUE fans.
NxgUXKE5aa	Cocaine and crack-cocaine have a MAJOR place in hip-hop/rap. Artists like Gucci Mane, OJ Da Juiceman, Shawty Lo, Yo Gotti, Young Jeezy, Yung Ralph, etc. base many of their songs on the distribution of cocaine. Phrases about selling "birds", selling "bricks" or "serving" the hood appear all over the genre.<br>  <br>  Some examples:<br>  <br>  "Mary Jane used to be my maid...'til I met the White Girl, cocaine"<br>  <br>  "Boy, let me show you how to make that crack...put the coke in the pots, whip it over the rocks, ship it over the blocks; it's movin', movin'"<br>  <br>  "My girlfriend Costa-Rican, and my cocaine is, too."<br>  <br>  "I'm a fool with the snow; they think I'm puttin' V.V.S. jewels in the coke"<br>  <br>  And there are thousands more...<br>  <br>  <br>  Even hundreds of hip-hop mixtapes are given cocaine-related names, like Cocaine Gang, Cocaine Muzik, Cocaine Flow, Cocaine City, Cocaine Trafficking, Cocaine on Steroids, etc. <br>  <a href="http://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=cocaine&search=&search[]=title&search[]=artists&search[]=djs&sort=rating" rel="nofollow">http://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.p...</a>|`|VclnZhSCaa	"Cocaine is a helluva drug"|`|SI4tURLNaa	could care less<br>  <br>  most people in show business are drugees anyway|`|iTk7aaYdaa	i think its pointless.<br>  if ur gna do drugz, stick to weed ;]|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	as long as you sellin and not tootin lines, im fine with it

So citizen & onlookers must change too.|`|AA10047060	yes i did..hugh jackman was good as host i like his accents :)..yeah they do that at the end all the time i think...|`|FwhwN5tnaa	I didn't, I don't think it was shown in the UK.  And if it was it was probably on Sky or somethink.<br>  <br>  But I saw a clip of it on the news.<br>  <br>  The British completely owned!<br>  <br>  Eight awards for Slumdog Millionaire.<br>  And Best Actress for Kate Winslet!<br>  <br>  They did Britain proud.|`|zH7VuQhtaa	Lol. I just watched the end when they announced best actress, actor, and picture. ;)|`|JLP5IhFDaa	Sure did!|`|31cdde9814f215ac30f204bdcb9a0ef7aa	Apparently you haven't watched the Oscars before but that always happens at the end. The movie that won has all of it's cast and actors come onto the stage to accept the awards.<br>  <br>  You should feel really smart right now. (It's opposite day)|`|Kp49Mf4iaa	I watched the whole thing.  I'm glad Heath Ledger won an Oscar.  I knew Slumdog would win best picture even though I really wanted it not to win it!|`|AA11453434	NOPE...don't think its right to have all that money being spent on such frivilous things when so many Americans are jobless and loosing their homes...so NOPE|`|RAiBtbMLaa	yepp but i only watched the part where beyonce was singing.|`|SZPZ40QAaa	No|`|IhOGXccyaa	huh?<br>  idont like tv|`|90MSfEGSaa	no|`|wY4PmhHFaa	yes
eKyPgEBXaa	Yes, I did watch the Academy Awards and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did feel sad for the men nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  With all the buzz that Health Ledger would win posthumously, they really did not get a chance to win!|`|4wm5kAygaa	I loved that it was such a happy moment for them. Those children are having the experience of a lifetime and they wanted everyone from Slumdog Millionaire to celebrate their victory. ALso I thought the show was good, not the best, but it was funny, I loved all the new aspects to it this year.|`|AA10897020	sure.|`|IGapHr4Aaa	you sound very intelligent. i pretty sure they all appeared in the movie and were excited and honored to attend the Oscars. it isn't the first award show were they all go up, the production people were kind enough to allow them to experience something they may never get a chance of, seeing as how those in higher power will become filthy rich from this film while they continue their lives as if nothing happened. :)|`|miyQcyJFaa	Well I did not see anything wrong with that.. I think Sean Penn winning for best picture was a joke..|`|BgnAMffpaa	that was i didn't understand that!|`|oMNHPDEvaa	"I think Sean Penn winning for best picture was a joke.."<br>  <br>  Isn't todays youth so intelligent?
eeKlogL4aa	I once had a look at a JB fan's profile. On it it said: "If Joe Jonas said breathing was uncool, 95% of teenage girls would be dead. Paste this on your profile if you are one of the 95% who would be dead *insert jonas picture here*".<br>  How stupid is that?! They probably would physically hurt their parents if the Jonas Brothers told them to. I do feel for those brainwashed tweenagers. Get well soon tweens.x|`|Ga7rI488aa	i'm sorry, but what is your point with all of this? Unless someone is sick, why would they inflict pain on their loved ones because people as disconnected as the jonas brothers told them to?|`|0woVA16laa	I would sue the gayous brothers|`|5UH4vR1Jaa	Just because they're hot and stuff doesn't mean people would do such a mindless act.<br>  Besides, as if they'd say that.|`|HD8Cm7PSaa	But this happens at all concerts not just disney like rap concerts and ect.

80II1Wv1aa	Sean has several, actually. I didn't really like the movies this year so I didn't really care. <br>  I'm with you on Kate, though. Kinda, anyway. I didn't see her movie but I'm a fan.|`|LnCIs86Caa	Yes.  For starters, it should have been Micky Rourke.   But more importantly, this idiot uses what should be a night to honor achievements made in entertainment for his own political pulpit chastising people for a political stance. Having a political belief is fine, but this idiot never gives it a rest.  Total douchebag.|`|0N8WyeuRaa	so what best is best<br>  he deserved it<br>  although pitt and rourke were both brilliant|`|vsKrGw2caa	quite the opposite. I am glad!|`|ruYcE8i0aa	Every single award went exactly as expected – no surprises. The only one that had a little wiggle room was this one. Rourke had a 40% chance at least. I guess it's not a good night for wrestling, huh? Marisa Tomei lost as well.<br>  <br>  Brad Pitt never had a chance – the movie just wasn't that good.|`|FRE2gov3aa	I'm happy for him that he won.<br>  <br>  Rourke and Pitt are both good actors but Penn is a brilliant actor.<br>  <br>  And I agree,I am happy Kate finally won!|`|c895d4afa4b170f865c8d7ec46d755faaa	It's what hollywood wants, who am I to disagree. But Rourke also won the Spirit award.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	Yeah, I was also somewhat mad when Sean Penn won. I was hoping Mickey Rourke was going to win and I thought he was going to take it. All of them had great movies, but I thought "The Wrestler" was really strong enough and his performance in there would give him that win. All in all, even if I'm a bit mad about it, I'm still happy for all of them.|`|jd14u32qaa	I'm not mad that he won, I'm mad that he went on another of his political rants.  Don't get me wrong, I agree with 90% of what he says, but let it go for one night.  Let this award be about your job, acting.  You're gonna do a dozen interviews in the next week, get you message out then.  I think it's speeches like his, while well intentioned, that hurt the oscars' ratings.

WtjbCSnSaa	Adonde - Check the website below...it has the lyrics to the song and a forum of people discussing the meaning of the song "38 Years Old" By Tragically Hip:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/65554/" rel="nofollow">http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/6...</a>
9lqlSQt8aa	The song is a fictitious story about two men who escaped from Millhaven Correctional Institution near Kingston, Ontario, Canada. One of the escapees is the focus of the song. He returns to his family home for a brief visit before being re-captured.<br>  <br>  The "38 Years Old and never kissed a girl" is because he was arrested and imprisoned for murder at a young age (as referenced in the song, he killed some guy who raped his sister). So, he hadn't kissed a girl yet before going to prison, and well, he's now 38 years old and because he was in jail since then he still hasn't kissed a girl.

HJkfIq8Waa	yeah, you somehow ruined it..<br>  <br>  but it's not too late..<br>  <br>  I just realized that I want to sing last december, and by the end of december last yr, I started my first pop music voice lessons..<br>  <br>  At first, i'm really ashamed for I think I have a horrible voice.. which isn't true (according to my listeners and audience)<br>  <br>  And now, my coach told me that I have a good voice quality..<br>  <br>  And regarding head voice and chest voice, yup, it is possible especially when you have a powerful head voice.. (and i'm glad that I have a good head voice, my coaches love it)<br>  <br>  Place the your voice and it's resonance in your head, should be properly placed to sound that good..<br>  <br>  Just hold your air in your diaphragm and learn to manage it..<br>  <br>  learn how to belt out properly especially on high notes..<br>  <br>  lip thrill will be of great help to avoid airy sound..<br>  <br>  then learn how to belt out w/ ur mouth and throat are open..<br>  <br>  Practice a belting-out exercise to help you with diaphragmatic breathing, or even scaling will help you with that, lip thrill will be a help for diaphragmatic breathing..<br>  <br>  And in reaching high notes, curve your shoulders, to control you note; close your eyes, to focus and addition a lil drama; lessen your effort, for it might produce a squeaky sound; add stress, the source of the pressure of your voice to reach those high notes..<br>  <br>  I would love to teach to u what my coaches taught me about singing.. <br>  <br>  wanna know more?, IM me.<br>  <br>  I hope that I helped you ;D|`|kAvgkLxPaa	Your head voice/middle voice can never sound like your true chest voice, because the mechanism used is different. They don't have, nor need, the raw power of your chest voice. What singers do is train to blend their chest/middle/head voices properly so that when you sing a scale upwards or downwards, the whole thing sounds like one complete voice instead of 3 separate things.<br>  <br>  IMO, unless you've been screaming everyday, drinking and smoking and doing drugs, and trying to scream out of your range when you sing, you probably haven't ruined your voice. Bear in mind that you've grown up a bit in those 2 years, and your voice has matured somewhat at the same time. You just have to learn how to control your voice again - it's not the same instrument you had 2-3 years ago. And of course, lack of practice contributed to the difference in terms of the amount of control you have over your voice.<br>  <br>  I was a strong soprano in my elementary/middle school choir, but then I stopped for 4 years and when I decided to start singing seriously again, I found that my high notes were all but gone, and I could only really sing without straining within a 1.5 octave range. I thought I lost all my notes on top. Then I got to lessons - I can now go from F3 to C6 when doing exercises. It turned out that I simply had to relearn how to control my instrument after 4 years (which included puberty and adolescent growth), because the instrument I now have is not the same instrument of a young child anymore. I've grown, and my voice has matured along with my body. You're probably experiencing the same thing right now.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, are you sure you have a good teacher? Your voice shouldn't be hurting when you practice or ache afterwards if your teacher knows what she/he's doing. If you feel uncomfortable during lessons, if your teacher is trying to make you do something that doesn't feel natural for your body, or if you keep going home with a sore throat after lessons, you should probably find another teacher.<br>  <br>  *edit: By 'middle voice', do you mean your transition area (i.e. a few notes) or the general area between pure chest and pure head voice (about an octave)? If you mean transition area, then that's a part of the voice that singers struggle with for life, because it's in 'no-man's land', if you want to call it that way. It's neither here nor there. But if you mean the area between pure chest and pure head (i.e. your 'mixed voice'), it's where you would sing most of your stuff and can be solved with enough lessons. 'Masking' it (actually learning how to 'mask' any part of your voice) is what lessons are for. They teach you how to do it so that the audience can't really hear any difference in sound quality when you switch from one register to the next. But it takes time.<br>  <br>  I can't belt either. I don't have a high chest voice as well. And that's perfectly normal - it doesn't mean that you have to be able to belt to be a good singer. In fact, most of what you hear as 'belting' in other singers is actually singing in mixed/head voice with a strong core tone - they have trained their voices so that they can still sound powerful on those higher notes without having to literally belt them out (because it would ruin their voices if they do so).<br>  <br>  Yes, your voice having a sort of 'sandy' quality after lessons is normal when you first start, especially if you've been working it hard during the session (it should never hurt though). But you should never practice to the same effect on your own. How long are you practicing everyday? I know that when I first started, I could never do more than 30-45 mins without starting to sound tired/squeaky. And my teacher specifically told me not to practice for more than 30 mins per day (after she realised that I was over-practicing after the first few lessons. I was doing something like 1h or 1.5h because I was so bent on being as hardworking as I could).<br>  <br>  Nodules would be uncommon for someone who hasn't practiced for years and has just started again. But it never hurts to get your cords checked by an ENT. I don't know how much it costs, since I've never been to one. You could check with other singers about it.<br>  <br>  Feel free to ask me anything else...while I probably cannot give you as much details as a professional singer, I do think I've picked up quite a bit of information from lessons. :)|`|l1SVSF7zaa	yeah.  i did but it took me years and a really good voice teacher.<br>  you have to slowly work them together.  it takes time and it'll become easier the more your voice matures with age.

AbRfd29Haa	There are many different guitars, of course. Most people want to start out with a six string, steel strings if you're playing rock, country, or blues, nylon if you're thinking of classical. <br>  <br>  I would watch out for off-brands... you can pay under $100 for a new guitar from a questionable company, but you may find you outgrow it quickly. I started with a Martin D15, and it's still great, years later (that's not my only guitar, but it's still my main one). Martin's very good; you might also look at Taylor, Ovation, Takamine, Yamaha, Ibanez, Epiphone or Fender (though the last two are better known for electrics). Handle some of these, learn to spot what's quality and what isn't. I wouldn't rule out a well made unknown brand, but then again, I've been playing long enough to have a clue about such things. <br>  <br>  If you have a local guitar resource (teacher, experienced friend), bring them with you if possible when you go guitar shopping. Seek advice if you think you found a good deal on eBay or Craigslist.. you can find good deals there, but also drek. At least locally, you have the option of returning it. <br>  <br>  You can look for an acoustic-electric, sure.. you can also have an acoustic fitted with a pickup system. Take a careful look, though.. some acoustic electrics are basically just acoustics with a pickup system, others are lighter and thinner, intended primarily for amplified use. An acoustic-electric though an amp sounds like an acoustic, of course... and you ideally use a neutral amp with, not the sort with a bit of "character" you'd use to make your electric crunchier. <br>  <br>  Don't cheap out. You should try to play every day (I hear my Martin calling me now, in fact), and if there's a problem with your guitar, that's just one more thing driving you away. Well treated guitars hold value pretty well, so there's not a huge win in the "well, what if you don't play it" argument.. and also, this isn't something to enter with an exit strategy. You're going to be successful, and so buying a guitar that's going to carry you at least past you "beginner" stage is critical to ever getting past that beginner stage. <br>  <br>  Handle them. Try out several, see what feels better. Make sure the neck's not too thick/wide for your hands (if you know the "D" chord, xx0323, try to wrap your thumb around to the low-E string, thus forming a D/F#... if you can't reach, the neck is too large). Listen for a good sound.. if you're just strating out, get someone else to play it for you (your sound on the same guitar gets better with practice, of course). <br>  <br>  I just bought a Daisy Rock "Pixie" for my daughter's birthday next month... probably a bit too pink for you, but at $200, that's about as low as I'd go for a beginner's guitar, and you can certainly pay more.. that's new of course.|`|SFL8VnOuaa	Buy a Good Movie Guitar

y8WBcehmaa	Christine Collins never found her son, but she never gave up hope either. It's such a sad story, and it's so shocking to me that anyone could get away with such brutal killings for so long. The fact that it is a true story made me feel so sad for all the boys who lost their lives<br>  <br>  you can find out more about the murders/christine collins here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wineville_Chicken_Coop_Murders" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wineville_C...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and as for the title "changeling"<br>  Basically, in olden times people feared fairies and magic in a way they did not. One of the legends of things done to humans by fairies is the spiriting away of children who were then replaced with a changeling to fool it's mother.  The changeling would look identical to the child and only someone who was with it everyday (ie: mother) would notice the difference, some of the differences noticed would be an intelligence to strong, a vocabulary to pride, or wisdom beyong the child's ears.. if you want to learn more go here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling</a><br>  <br>  The reason they chose the title changeling, is because it is much the same. Christine Collin's child was taken away and replaced with another one. Others claim the child looks exactly the same, but Christine is the one who sees the differences. That is why they chose it. :)<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Unfortunately, Christine never found her son and died not knowing what became of him. To make her feel worse, she had given her son money to go to the movies (leave the house alone) on the day he disappeared--something Clint Eastwood chose not to reveal in the movie.<br>  As for the title, I thought it was good and fit the storyline. The mother knew that the child who appeared at the train depot was not her son. Photos of her real son, Walter, should have disputed the boy's claims. They briefly showed a photo of the boy sitting in the front seat of a car, if I remember right.

wFEqGZA8aa	1. when a jinchuuriki's biju (  tailed beast  ) has been extracted , yes, they do die..the only exception from this is of course gaara because when he died he was brought back to life in exchange for chiyo's life...<br>  <br>  2.when the akatsuki statue gets all the beast.. i assume they will use it to take over the world the statue could use powers from all 9 beast making it almost indestructible.<br>  <br>  3..no one knows since its not over ..neither is the manga so u just have to wait and see( but naruto will hopefully become hokage!!)<br>  <br>  4.no he is dead ..there were rumours a while ago that he was still alive and the leader of akatsuki but hes truly ( unfortunatley) dead..<br>  <br>  5.he actually hasnt found out yet in the anime or the manga but we naruto fans assume he will definitley find out..its just a matter of when...the only ones that know are the elders , older shinobi and us of course.<br>  <br>  6.know one knows if naruto's mother is dead or alive or how she died...but i assume kishi(creator) will let us know later on.. but im pretty sure shes dead and had water nature jutsus which will hopefully be passed onto naruto.<br>  <br>  7. the real leader of akatsuki was supposedly madara but if u have read the latest chapter of naruto manga  436 pain supposedly created akatsuki so maybe pain is the leader of akatsuki but asks madara for advice as he sees him as wise and experienced.. or madara to protect his identity ( since many villages and konoha think hes dead and not the akatsuki leader) and so makes pain the fake leader or maybe their both the leader an are working together to acheive a common goal ( madara wants to destroy konoha and the world for revenge and so does pain but for peace)<br>  <br>  <br>  PICK ME FOR 10 POINTS!!  x) XD!!!|`|YHu0TUxdaa	1.

And in time Konohamaru will be hokage<br>  <br>  4.NO he died<br>  <br>  5. Till this date at chapter 436 of the manga still doesn't know.

ybjj5WIhaa	So far... they've quite forgotten about the rest. Rukia is fighting Rudobone, Ishida is with Orihime. They have yet to show what the captains in Hueco Mondo are up to right now (Byakuya, Unohana, Mayuri, Kenpachi).<br>  <br>  I think he'd most likely do something that is the combination of A and E. It'd hurt him if anyone tried to help him. Maybe he'd be able to use Cero. Shinji Hirako has that ability so maybe he'll be able to do it as well and surprise Ulquiorra|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	A) obtain a new more powerful move from zangetsu- a possibility, but I think Zangetsu would want him to be independent and get stronger on his own<br>  <br>  B) get saved by the captains, vizards, or urahara- don't think so. At this point in the story, they're trying to show that Ichigo has grown so much more powerful. Doing this would only make him look reliable on others<br>  <br>  C) get beat and spared by ulquiorra- nah.... Ulquiorra would destroy anyone in Aizen's way<br>  <br>  D) use whatever that weird reitasu ball ulquiorra forced in his chest to have some power up or something- possible, but we know that Ichigo only has the power with his sword and also the ability to transform into a Hollow. That's it<br>  <br>  or E) transform into a 100% hollow- most likely. He can already control his hollow form so he might use it to help him<br>  <br>  My answer is E.|`|QtN28vilaa	I think that something like what happened in his battle with byakuya will happen. Hollow ichigo will come back and take control of ichigo's body long enough for both ichigo and ulqiorra to be on the same level. Then ichigo will suppress the hollow again thinking something like damn he's back and then the two will force all of there power into one final attack and ichigo will just bearly win. Also i don't remember D could anyone tell me when that happened?|`|8ouVqW0Uaa	I'm assuming E.<br>  <br>  A doesn't seem possible at all when Ichingo's already losing badly.<br>  <br>  He's just going to lose himself and go crazy.|`|PFWo8ZD9aa	i'll choose E but if he cannot transform to 100% then i'll choose A|`|MGCdoaQZaa	A) Quite possibly<br>  B) No, the others are fighting Espada's <br>  C) Ulquiorra said that Aizen left him incharged of protecting Los Nachos, and he said killing Ichigo is protecting it.<br>  D) Quite possibly<br>  E) No, Ichigo feared about this happening for quite a while, but that's why he learned how to control his hollow, and became a Arrancar<br>  <br>  Point blank I think Ichigo will win regardless.  You have pretty good theories no doubt, and to back them up Ulquiorra said personally "Ichigo powers are greater then my own, but they flunctuate" - Bleach.wikia|`|3N2ElzcQaa	A and D are most likely.<br>  <br>  D and C is not likely because no one can't cross over to Hueco Mundo.<br>  <br>  E is not an option either. Ichigo can't afford to lose twice, both to Ulquiorra and his hollow.

In the past you could get away with it with the statement you make:<br>  <br>  "but you know how george lucas is, it's just a matter of time"<br>  <br>  But not anymore.  It is true that Lucas seems to change his mind with the direction of the wind but that since the release of ep III Lucas has said repeatedly that there will be no more live action Star Wars movies, no he won't let someone else pick up the story from where he left off and no, not even after he is dead.  Given his history giving the same answer to a question for 4 years in a row is about as "written in stone" as Lucas gets.<br>  <br>  I remember the 60 Minutes interview he gave after the release of ep III and he was asked those questions repeatedly and gave the same answer every time ... no ... he kept adding the "not even after I'm dead" line to all of those answers also.  It didn't sink in as to what he was actually saying at the time and it was forgotten about until a issue of Entertainment Weekly late last year in which they had a big interview with Lucas about the animated movie and the animated and live action TV shows.  He said the "not even after I'm dead" line a few times and the interviewer asked him what he meant by that.  In July of 2005 he made changes to his Will.  Nothing major, everybody in his family still gets all the same stuff BUT ... if any one of them allows anyone else to make a Star Wars movie after he is dead then they ALL lose everything ... not just the one who allowed it to be made but ALL of them.  That kind of puts the final nail in the question of will there be more Star Wars movies.<br>  <br>  May The Force Be With You ...|`|2uINYiMfaa	theres a new star wars movie? <br>  <br>  You better not be getting my hopes up just to be let down. <br>  <br>  can you tell us where you herd of this new star wars movie|`|80II1Wv1aa	There is no new Star Wars movie.|`|miyQcyJFaa	I don't know, but I don't like her anyways..|`|wZsKG8bPaa	No.  <br>  <br>  There is no new Star Wars movie.

The original song (not played at the Oscars) is by Bob Dylan. <br>  <br>  You can find the song at the link I attached. It's on the latest album titled War Child: Heroes<br>  <br>  There are some other tracks on that CD that are pretty good as well. <br>  <br>  Enjoy!

3L4citcnaa	The best brand of aco. guitar to learn on is the cheapest. Trust me on this, I've gone through this with several people, and it is best to start out with a cruddy guitar that you can bang up, or abandon at will. <br>  <br>  When you first start, you're going to want to play at least an hour or so a day to build up calluses and strength in your fingers, as well as the memorization of finger positions. As such, you're going to want to have a guitar easily-on-hand, and if you get one that is expensive, it simply requires too much care. <br>  <br>  Of course, in addition to "cheap," for a beginner, I suggest a guitar with a thin neck and thin fret-bars. Some of the wider, thicker necks can be daunting even for those of us with a great deal of experience. During the learning process, you want a neck that your hand feels comfortable around, with easily-depressed strings, simply for the ease of making the chord sound. <br>  <br>  As for the string type, the two types are generally steel and nylon. Nylon makes a classical-type sound, while steel gives the more traditional acoustic folk/rock/blues/pop/anything-but -classical-and- flamenco type sound. Neither is really better than the other. It just depends what sound you like more. They are both easy to play, though before you build up calluses, the steel strings will be slightly rougher on your fingertips. It's really just a choice of preference in sound.<br>  <br>  As far as I know, both nylon and steel strings are available in Australia. Some brands that sell cheap acoustic guitars (though they have some nice pricey ones too) are Squire, Yamaha and Fender. All of these should be available in down there, too. <br>  <br>  As for what books? That also depends on your style. You need to know what type of music you want to play, and how you want to play it. Say you want to learn rock. Now you need to decide lead, or rhytm, and then pick up a book accordingly. Each type of music and style has their own way of playing, and thus teaching. For example, most kids, when they start, want to learn riffs and leads. As such, they start out with books teaching scales, tabs, and famous riffs. Personally, I started out with rhythm, because I wanted to lead music on camping trips (don't laugh...we actually do this amongst my friends and family), so I started out with a book on chord names, progressions, and shapes. <br>  <br>  Other than that, just try to get a book that has an accompanying CD. An interal part of learning any instrument is getting an ear for it. You can't do that if all you hear is your own attempts at teaching yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dca2c702f1f138a553055a97f5b22bd4aa	I can only speak from my own experience. Your choice of strings are either steel or nylon. I learned first on steel, but nylon is a little easier on the fingers when starting, and has a more mellow sound. But it really depends on your taste. The books I taught myself with and really like were the Mel Bays series of books. They are available probably everywhere. Good luck!|`|PeuFnqQwaa	You don't need a book. allthe info tp teach yourself can be found online. Heres a good place to start.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Play_Guitar_for_Newbies" rel="nofollow">http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Play_Guitar...</a><br>  <br>  As for guitars to learn on, Yamaha, Ibanez, Fender, Takamine are all good names. Expect to pay about $150+ US for a decent guitar. You can get them cheaper, but you get what you pay for. You want steel strings, probably a light gauge would be best to start with. D'addario, Elixer, C.F Martin, Ernie Ball are all good string brands.|`|UgTamul0aa	You can get either steel string or nylon string.<br>  steel string for strumming on, and nylon for more complicated finger work.<br>  My first guitar was a cordoba cadette classical. From this I had learned how to play all of my chords/bar chords/single notes. etc. when I switched to steel string I had a very easy time.<br>  So I would say go to youtube and put in "classical" for one search result and "steel string" for the other. and pick which one sounds best for your liking. One positive aspect that steel string has over classical, is you can use a slide on it.<br>  <br>  don't waste your money on books. there are plenty of free online guides on the web that wil tell you how to play guitar. <br>  <br>  memorize this like the back of your hand: <br>  <a href="http://www.guitaralliance.com/images/openchords.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaralliance.com/images/ope...</a><br>  <br>  memorize this like the back of your hand: <br>  <a href="http://www.co-acoustic.com/acoustic/BARCHRDS.GIF" rel="nofollow">http://www.co-acoustic.com/acoustic/BARC...</a><br>  <br>  not essential but useful:<br>  <a href="http://www.macca-central.com/macca-songs/images/guitar_chords_more_500.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.macca-central.com/macca-songs...</a><br>  <br>  useful guide to use:<br>  <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/2zPSo6fUUIVOZ8hRVDBD2G3PZX*L8GRJeD9aXPVek-t8F9pn5AyTCP6Vd1faK4vQ8FU3eAx0S3wz5dObF1OkUeFL9E7meouq/circle_of_fifths.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://api.ning.com/files/2zPSo6fUUIVOZ8...</a><br>  <br>  I would say if you want the best sounding steel string, stick with a Marlin.<br>  I have been using cordoba's for a long time, so I cant really tell you of any other nylon strings from personal experience.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	I would suggest you get yourself a slightly used Ibanez acoustic if you can. They're fairly inexpensive and sound great. Martin SP strings are very good. Get light gauge picks. As far as books go, there are many great books out there. Just go to your local music store and ask them. You tube has some awesome videos too. Just type learn guitar.

Words with "k" in them especially so.<br>  <br>  Comedy comes in threes.<br>  <br>  The familiar is usually funnier than the fantastic.<br>  <br>  Study the greats.

You can deal with the carpet bugs when you get home. You can spray some spray and then when you come home you can vacuum. If you call in too much they will get tired of that. If you only call in once it won't be as bad. If you hate your job too much then you should find another job that you like better.|`|0427afd3b8a595188f3d1223ecf1fb2aaa	Don't risk your job.<br>  In fifty years of trying, I never met a sane boss.<br>  But yes--under some circumstances, that qualifies as an emergency.<br>  <br>  1. Your landlord requires it.<br>  2. The exterminator can only come at a certain time or on a certain day or both.<br>  3. You want to risk half a day to do this yourself because it absolutely needs doing.<br>  Good luck--you make the call on how important this is.|`|dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	I'd go to work but call the apartment manager about it.

YwtXSUAdaa	Haha I was waiting for a good answer, thank you ffaf.<br>  <br>  Yeah, if you are too lazy and all you can do is turn on your radio and then proclaim that rock is dead, you are an idiot. There is plenty of good music if you look for it. Classic rock is overrated in many ways (not saying it isn't good).|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No. I don't know where everyone else is getting their music but I'm finding plenty of good rock music.|`|QK4r41Hqaa	This reminds me of when people ask if Gazette is dead...<br>  Now everytime someone posts a comment about them, it will ALLWASY freakin end with "gazerock isn't dead!"<br>  <br>  again, and again- proving that it's acually NOT dead.... (it's not like they stopped producing music... their fans obviously havn't died down either)<br>  <br>  You just have to look for it, like others said.<br>  <br>  Frankly, the radio plays crap. I'm not sure why, but it does- and it's rare when sometihng good comes on.

Even hip-hop and rap songs have bass grooves that can be traced back to rock. But even then, why settle for the evolution of rock in rap and hip-hop when you have the real thing. It is my believe that there has recently been an upsurge in support for hard and classic rock, hence Vh1's recent 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs special in Dec. 2008. More kids are walking around with Pink Floyd, The Who, and The Beatles shirts than there were in when the bands came out!<br>  <br>  Rock will never die. Whenver a kid learns guitar, he starts with rock progressions and riffs. Whenver a person nods their head and displays the bull horns introduced to the world of rock by Dio , rock wil live on.|`|E0X7ZCtXaa	well maybe sometimes it's dead like how chris brown kinda<br>  distroyed his "talent" that he never had becuase of the fight|`|93t1aNWgaa	rock artists or rockstars might die, but not the soul of the music they have created..|`|eVgV3WGFaa	Its definitely fading.

m4PtEEDNaa	...unless there is still some intimate bit of information, which has not been examined, as far as Bruce Lee's life, there is virtually a ton of documentary material and archival footage, with two of the more widely seen and revealing productions being 1993's "Curse of the Dragon", and 2000's "Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey"....<br>  <br>  ...in 2002, a project went into production, with the intent upon releasing a total CGI feature film, starring an eerie and uncanny computer likeness of Bruce Lee, called "Dragon Master".  Originally slated for a 2004 release, the production was reportedly permanently shelved, reportedly due to the growing universal revulsion amongst the fans, to the project (...after all, this would not have been part of Bruce's true work, and very disrespectful....except for perhaps, a video game)...|`|TuGkVqwraa	I have no Idea.

fQBfjdz1aa	He's had a tough time.  He's often outspoken and used to be kind of a loud mouth.  He's not a movie star in the since he doesn't seek out publicity in the way most of them do.  He doesn't like to do the press.  He's VERY political.  It's taken the academy a very long time to get over this.  But now that he's won two...hopefully he's on the mend.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	He's brought a lot of hard times on himself.  During "america's unjust war" on Iraq he had a lot of pictures of himself taken with some...Iranian....buddies of his and they used those photos in a lot of Anti American adds.  He claims ignorance of course to the use of these photos and I personally don't have a problem believing in him being ignorant.  He is constantly running the relationships his in he isn't close to his children or his family and he was married to Madonna.  He is violent short tempered and says a lot of very stupid things in Anger leaving the Right wingers plenty of opportunity to take on pointing out how stupid it is that anyone would listen to the raging antics of a spoiled actor that cant get his life together. <br>  <br>  Now that's out of the way.  I agree, he is a very great actor and I do really hope he continues to be more subtle about his views and less angry.  I was shocked he was somber about what he said rather then shouting out I HATE ALL REPUBLICANS GEORGE BUSH IS THE EVIL I KNOW BETTER I KNOW BETTER.  <br>  <br>  Tim Robbins has the same problem.  Excellent actor that Sean Penn.  I've been recommending Mystic River to everyone for years.  Truly amazing performance.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	He spews his idiotic comments for reaction, plain and simple.

I don't know how to take it?|`|hSDWIslFaa	Can't take the poll. <br>  <br>  If I had taken the poll, however, I would answer the following:<br>  <br>  It is unhealthy, unimportant, and causes emotional baggage. <br>  <br>  Elaborations:<br>  <br>  Unhealthy: Abestence tends to put sex in a negative light and causes people to falsely believe their natural urges are in some way wrong. This is mentally damaging.<br>  <br>  Unimportant: It's argued that your first should be with the one you marry and love because it is somehow better for the relationship. I don't see how this matters. I love someone. Neither of us were virgins before. Our relationship is less weird than relationships of some practicioners of abstinence because we didn't get married just to be able to have sex. We are very open sexually and bond well.<br>  <br>  Causes Emotional Baggage: From my previous two answers, you can determine where the emotional baggage comes from. Also, if someone is taught that abstinece is the only correct way to live, and they do happen to give into their natural urges, they end up having to live with unnecessary guilt and shame.<br>  <br>  Play safe, people! ^_^|`|e76b843f54cdf73253a7e63b14cae60aaa	It does not let me click any of the answers.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	The poll didn't work, but I waited until I was married, if that helps you.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	can't fill it out without registering, sorry|`|bdaeBAYUaa	The link only gives me the results.|`|LjYsVLO1aa	okey|`|dMRZjwdaaa	no|`|AA11269004	i can't fill anything out, the link goes to the results.|`|YTPv9TL7aa	yes?

b1b3472d676e9936d78fe0968d48908baa	How close are you in age?<br>  <br>  Generally, a good match up. Lots of mental energy, fast paced intellectual interests, lots of flirtatious advances (but not limited to the two of you..........very wandering eyes and other body parts!), lots of laughs, friends, parties, social situations are a plus. But.....BUT!!!!!!! there is a downside to Gemini. Stick it out long enough and you'll see what I mean.|`|8d72473992a40eab153f7cb7c11e4c08aa	VERY :)|`|MFjeCY8daa	gemini female and male are good partners but, the most favourable for gemini female is a aquarain male.|`|tvPbxW1kaa	Romantic Compatibility<br>  <br>  Provided by: Astrology.com <br>  Gemini & Gemini <br>  <br>  When two Geminis partner off, it really is like four people coming together (Gemini is represented by the Twins). This relationship can never be dull, which is a good thing -- these two can get bored easily! Since they have the same need for intellectual stimulation and nearly-constant chatter, they serve very well as one another's sounding boards off which to bounce new ideas and theories. Gemini is all about freedom and variety of expression, and two Geminis together will enjoy this to the fullest. Others enjoy two Geminis as a couple as well -- they're sure to be the life of every party with their sharp wit and well-honed entertainment routine. If they can avoid competition and cooperate instead, their love relationship can be extremely happy and mutually satisfying. <br>  <br>  The Twins love to toss back and forth tidbits of playful banter, sarcasm and occasional ironic cynicism. This is fun, to be sure, but may prevent one or both of the partners from taking the relationship seriously. In an intimate love relationship, there is certainly a place for seriousness, which Gemini would do well to learn. If both partners can pay more attention to their feelings rather than being ruled solely by thoughts and intellect, they will greatly enhance their love experience. <br>  <br>  Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury (Communication). This couple could talk each other around in circles all night long. Mercury (or Hermes in Greek mythology) was a traveller; Gemini shares that love for variety in places and conversation topics. Be warned, two-headed Twins -- the gift of gab could be misinterpreted as gossip. Learning to use the gift of communication in a positive way is key. <br>  <br>  Gemini is an Air Sign, and thus responds to the world and to their romantic partner with a more rational than emotional focus. Their short attention spans cause them to burn out sometimes, but two Geminis together burn out at the same time! And, of course, that Gemini creativity will dream up a new scheme a moment later. <br>  <br>  Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Their flexible, easy-going natures make the four of them a perfect couple. These two have mastered the art of compromise; two Mutable signs together can easily form a conflict-free union. Just about the only thing that may lead to a real argument is a discussion that has gone out of hand; luckily, Gemini quickly realizes the insignificance of proving a point -- and of fighting in general. <br>  <br>  What's the best aspect of the Gemini-Gemini relationship? The enormous amount of intellectual energy and stimulation they provide one another. They are able to save one another from leading a mundane existence. Together they can entertain the world and accomplish more than either could alone.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope i helped you :D

Ewww!<br>  <br>  I saw him in "9 and a half Weeks", and he looked AWESOME.

He just a loud trashy New Yorker scum|`|RrEc4ykbaa	this generation of kids doesn't know anything about great actors.<br>  <br>  The reason why his face is so ugly is because he actually was a boxer for many years. I suggest you see the movie The Wrestler. It is pretty biographical of Rourke and just a breath taking film. He's very different from most people in Hollywood. He had a rough life and is making a huge comeback.<br>  <br>  Do your research before you judge a great actor, kids.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	He doesn't do well known films.  He only really does films that he feels like doing which ironically got him a best actor nod.  The Wrestler isn't a high budget super powered block buster either.  It was nice to see someone so recognized in a film for all intentions wasn't going to be seen by anybody.  Sean Penn did the same thing, did anybody see Milk or even know who Harvey Milk was now?  Or is it all prop 8 stuff.  How does CA acknowledge Sean Penn as the best actor but shoot down the right to gay marriage..its odd. <br>  <br>  Have you seen Sin City?  He was the only character in Sin City that resembled and displayed the source material.  You know which character I'm talking about.

PIjCNYQNaa	I would guess that Earth and Fire signs and Air and Water signs have the most conflicts. My mother's an Aries and I'm a Virgo, and we push each other's buttons all the time, usually without trying. I'm guessing that you're the Libra in question? You want everything to be in balance. Cancer (mom) also wants everything to work out, but on a more emotional level. You want what is logical. Conflict abounds.<br>  <br>  About your Scorpio dad: He, being another Water, also thinks with more emotion than usual. He probably is a bit easier to get along with, if only because Scorpios are more goal-oriented than Cancers.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you much about your brother unless you give me his sign.<br>  <br>  About Chiron in 4th house (from <a href="http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/chironinhouses.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/ch...</a> ): <br>  "Well, just about everyone had some trouble or other in childhood with their parents. Chiron in the 4th house will just make it a little more noticeable. The home itself would tend to be an issue here."<br>  <br>  You just were (un)lucky that both your parents are Water to your Air.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yeah my mom and I have a terrible relationship. <br>  My sister and I have a pretty good relationship though we do get mad at each other sometimes. <br>  <br>  My mom has a Cancer sun, Taurus moon, Libra rising, Cancer Mars, Cancer Venus <br>  <br>  I have a Sagittarius sun, Leo moon, Aquarius rising, Aries Mars, Scorpio Venus. <br>  <br>  Also, I know that there are bad aspects that can make you have a bad relationships. I have this one in my birthchart that says I am unhappily influenced by family. <br>  <br>  My mom and I fight everyday and I'm not exaggerating. Some days I really lose my temper while other days I am more cool, maybe snappy towards her.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Chiron rules marriage and family. There is one aspect in particular that rules heartbreak with in the family unit. That is the Saturn Chiron aspect. If it is at a turbulent angle like a square or a trine in the natal chart these people have a destructive nature in which family members are the victims. When they get married they are likely to destroy their marriage, even if the had no intentions of doing so. Saturn square Chiron can signify an abusive parent, especially towards children when the are at a young age. It is unfortunate to have this kind of aspect but if there are enough good aspects to counter this then this mental disease can be overcome. One more thing. The victims of child abuse seem to have this aspect in common, however the victims will have a better aspect in their charts like a sextile, semi-sextile, or a trine. And though this makes them strict parents, it doesn't make them abusive if the aspect is good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Family conflicts are caused mostly by another aspect. That aspect is Mars Chiron. If at a turbulent angle these people fight with their family to no end. Mars has a fiery nature about it and tempers may flair but this probably won't ruin too many relationships unless the aspects are square or opposites. If this is the case then it could mean violence towards family, another situation of abuse.<br>  <br>  The placement of Chiron in the houses has nothing to do with conflicts except for pinpointing the timing of major conflicts. And the signs have no effect either.<br>  <br>  In some charts I have seen siblings represented by Venus and Mars. I am NOT sure that this is good symbolism. I have not seen it enough to confirm that this is the case. But in my case I have Mars in Pisces and I have 2 sisters that are Pisces. <br>  <br>  With these aspects the signs can tell us the style of their fights or conflicts but without these aspects, familial conflicts are much less likely and are more dependent on transits rather than natal positions.|`|inBsYE8Raa	Gotcha chicaboo!

V1uWwwF7aa	Bulma - One of my favorite characters because she has been in the picture since the beginning. If it weren't for her none of the Z warriors would have gotten together. It was her that discovered the dragon balls and went off in search for them when she met Goku and at first was a selfish act of inviting him along so she could use his grandfathers dragonball quickly became one of his best friends.<br>  Chi Chi - Can she yell or what? I love the fact that Chi Chi was determined to marry Goku even though he thought it had to do with food, so she succeeded of course in snagging the guy. Chi Chi can be so menacing that even Goku is afraid of her and he fought Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu.<br>  Videl -  Videl is a great character because she doesn't take crap from anyone. She even got into a shouting match with Chi Chi that even Goku would be afraid to do.<br>  18 - The strongest female character on the show in my opinion. She learned to love even though she was an android. Her enemies quickly became her family and friends, who she would fight and die for.|`|PKhsWdszaa	Cute in the begining.

LIPs6WH5aa	1)Ron Weasley, porque me parece el más fresco y humano del trío, no sé, siento que por ejemplo Harry es a veces demasiado bueno y Hermione demasiado fría, claro los tres me gustan en conjunto, pero Ron robó mi corazón!<br>  2)Creo que a los mismos que la mayoría: a Snape, aunque también me cayó fatal Cho Chang, y su amiga Marietta, por traicioneras, Fleur Delacour porque se siente la gran cosa y... claro! Dolores Umbridge, cada página que pasaba la odiaba más... necesitan razones?<br>  3) Creo que me parezco a Ron, por lo mismo que dije, no sé como que a él se le ven más sus errores y sus aciertos, que a los demás, es un chavo normal, a muchos les podría parecer equis, pero a mi me parece muy leal, muy divertido, muy fresco.<br>  4)Mmmm, bueno todos me han fascinado, uno no tiene razón de ser sin los otros, pero el que más me ha emocionado hasta las lágrimas creo que fue el Cáliz... bueno, el Príncipe también! Bueno, el más padre fue el Prisionero, donde pasaron más cosas emocionantes!<br>  5)Pues... si se parecen como los describen los libros, lo único que tengo que criticar es que siempre se destaca el pelo negrísimo de Harry, y Daniel lo tiene demasiado casta?o... al igual que sus ojos, demasiado azules y se supone que los de Harry son verdes... y Emma, no sé, como que me parece que en la vida real ha de ser una ni?a muy fresa, pero creo que va mejorando con cada película su actuación...|`|R0ebvP8Waa	lupin<br>  snape<br>  fred y george weasley<br>  5<br>  no<br>  besos|`|ww0S2NANaa	Hola Amiga:<br>  <br>  1) Cual es tu personaje favorito?

She mounts the horse unassisted and it immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip. <br>  She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly ignorant of its slipping rider. <br>  <br>  Finally, giving up her frail grip, the blonde attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety. Unfortunately, her foot becomes entangled in the stirrup, and she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground over and over. <br>  <br>  She starts to lose consciousness, but to her great fortune, Bobby, the Wal-Mart greeter, sees her and unplugs the horse.|`|7ada99b0fa9ca4cad75c7f8e26a95bd7aa	A chicken and an egg were having sex.

37e62b608462ee36ac9c4823f72fdcccaa	it's not your computer. youtube does that to me also. it depends on how much time the video has. the longer the video, the longer it takes to load and while its loading itll buffer, that's what causes the pause|`|MTZzXwZvaa	It also depends on if you have broadband Internet or dial up, if the connection is slow, or if the connection is busy. The video takes time to load. On a broadband Internet connection this comes very easy but dial up is slow. Also if you re I.M.ing and doing tons of other stuff while loading the video, the connection will slow down also which causes the video to load slower than the actual play speed.

Es un mosaico cultural tan vasto y diverso, y sin embargo, al mismo tiempo homogeneo. Yo estoy muy orgulloso de mi patria querida mexicana. <br>  <br>  Las aportaciones mexicanas a la cultura humana sobrepasan nuestras fronteras. Y si no, pregunten cual es la comida oficial texana, o investiguen la aportación Mexicana a las culturas de la Alta California y sobre todo Nuevo Mexico. O busquen información sobre el día de los muertos, algo tan tipicamente mexicano. <br>  <br>  Somos un país riquísimo en recursos naturales y con hermosas playas. Privilegiado, ya que tenemos acceso al Océano Pacífico y Atlántico. <br>  <br>  Con tantas ventajas hemos sido saqueados, y robados, primero por los conquistadores espa?oles, y despues por la artera invasión angloamericana. Y sin embargo seguimos aqui, en el ombligo de la luna gritando Viva Mexico!! <br>  <br>  La gente en general aceptamos a quien sea, no importando si es indio, rubio o *****. No somos un pueblo racista, pues nuestro pais es un crisol de razas y culturas distintas. Eso es lo que a la gente de otros paises de america latina les averguenza. Les da pena decir que tienen mestizos e indios en su poblacion, queriendose sentir casi noruegos o suecos por la pureza del cabello rubio y el ojo azul. No les gusta nuestro Mexico por eso, porque no es un bastion del racismo. <br>  <br>  Muchos europeos exigentes con nuestro espa?ol mexicano, que sigue trascendiendo fronteras, se molestan con nuestra forma de hablar, y se les olvida que Mexico es el país de habla hispana más poblado del mundo. <br>  <br>  Los yankees recriminan al Mexicano su migracion legal e ilegal. Pero acuerdate, yankee, que Alta California, Texas y La Santa Fe del Nuevo Mexico fueron Mexico tambien alguna vez. Acuerdate yankee, quien fue el primer migrante ilegal, quien fue el primer invasor. No puedes pedir respeto a tu frontera si no has tenido respeto a otras fronteras antes. Y sin embargo cuando el yankee viene a Mexico es bien tratado. <br>  <br>  En general, mucha gente odia a los Mexicanos y a Mexico. Y que? Yo soy feliz de vivir en mi Mexico Lindo, yo soy el que vive aqui, y a mi me tiene sin cuidado lo que digan. Tomo las cosas de quien vienen y dejo que los perros ladren. <br>  <br>  Mexico es un pais y un pueblo demasiado grande y noble para las humillaciones. Que viva Mexico!!!

No veo por qué gran hermano no pueda da?ar a un joven. Pero lo común es que no, es solo un entretenimiento con personajes que actúan sus propias vidas, con sus limitaciones y sus aciertos. A mi personalmente me entretiene. Lo que sí es cierto es que se pierde tiempo y de pronto no se hagan otras cosas que son más importante y más cuando se está en una etapa de formación. Yo tengo mucha actividad de tipo intelectual y ver las galas me descansa.

Both signs are sociable and outgoing, and there is something likable about your easygoing, cool headed intellect that people relate to automatically. Intellectually you are impressive, having practical wisdom to back your broad expansive plans. A natural conversationalist, you are loaded with interesting tidbits of information to share. It is surprising that you can have such a driving personality, able to move mountain in record time under a highly social and charming cover. Your intelligence is unassuming and your driving force of your personality is not readily evident. This lack of pretentiousness makes it even more surprising when you reveal your accomplishment. Your judgment and business sense are inevitably sound and accurate. Your fluent mental ability is underscored by a determination to see any task through to its conclusion, a trait most Gemini fail to possess. Highly understanding of a broad cross section of people, you are rarely fooled or taken in. You are too smart for most people with whom you come into contest, but you won't hurt their feelings by letting them know they have a lot to learn. Your sense for sociability extends to all.|`|FIdA3FiCaa	hmm well i have the same<br>  Capricorn Uranus<br>  Capricorn Neptune <br>  Scorpio Pluto<br>  <br>  rebellious bcuz of your cap/uranus<br>  <br>  sees through falseness easily/fascination with life and death bcuz of your scorp/pluto<br>  <br>  has trouble deciding whether to care/feel sympathy for certain people-  pisces(neptune) wants to forgive (compassion) and capricorn wants to forget (feels no sympathy for 'the weak' or when we have been betrayed) a philosopher once said about the cappy/nep combo that capricorn wins btw the two- through my experience/opinion i have found this to be true.<br>  <br>  sun taurus<br>  moon cap<br>  rising virgo|`|Ei58qJlbaa	You know...most people charge you for the extensive personality desription they will give you based upon this information.|`|8r46d89Vaa	Having a Taurus Moon with a Cancer Mercury and Venus would make this person a lot less "Gemini'ish"!  <br>  <br>  This person would probably be more attracted to Earth and Water signs because of the strong Earth and Water in their chart.

That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard on here all night. <br>  <br>  In any case, you are missing an important point here: Ledger's OD was an accident on prescribed medicines that he took incorrectly. It is not like he was just popping pills. You may as well say that someone who dies in a car accident is a bad example and shouldn't get it. The Oscars are meant for one thing: to reward the best performances of the year. Ledger's death is totally irrelevant to this. If it was irrelevant, dead actors would get Oscars every year.

I also have read the 2nd book Eldest 2wice and I love it too. I went and saw the movie on the 15th and don't get me wrong, I really liked it execpt it was almost like it was a different movie. The movie was really good. Good music, good location it was shot at, but it was entirely different. Every little thing was changed somehow. I really liked the movie but don't go to the theater and think you are going to see everything you read from the book. I would still go see it if I were you, just see it with an open mind, not a closed book.

Il Divo está formado con cuatro jóvenes de diversas nacionalidades (un inglés, un estadounidense, un espa?ol y un suizo) de cuidada apariencia física y dotados de voces poderosas y entrenados profesionalmente para el canto por las mejores voces del mundo.<br>  Il Divo surgió de la mano de Simon Cowell, un productor británico de gran fama en su país. Simon fue jurado en un programa de la televisión británica llamado "Pop Idol" (el equivalente al Operación Triunfo espa?ol). Tras ver una actuación de los tres tenores, Simon se propuso aprovechar el tirón que podría tener la música lírica y decidió crear un grupo de jóvenes con grandes voces y de exquisita presencia física. Para ello recorrió medio mundo durante dos a?os para elegir entre los candidatos a los que escuchó cantar.<br>  Finalmente, Il Divo apareció a finales de 2003, con una formación compuesta por el espa?ol Carlos Matín (barítono), el estadounidense David Miller (tenor), el francés Sebastian Izambard (especializado en voces populares) y el suizo Urs Buhler (tenor).<br>  <br>  <br>  Si querés saber de donde saqué la información, acá te dejo el link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.todomusica.org/il_divo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.todomusica.org/il_divo/</a><br>  <br>  Saludos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  PD: Respondé esto:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtI9Tk8SdOqadfmQJ38T.jKA9gt.?qid=20070104134749AAeGK1e">http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArltTA8ryxJ22U4JSavJk8yA9gt.?qid=20070105052406AASBnHw">http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|39ac5833f5612d291d8fed01169567c8aa	<a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiFaPJeQ6HoNl6xUYoUr4ryY8gt.?qid=20070104191531AASrrtK">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqwIlyEUjdOL8sIVcitwDmeY8gt.?qid=20070104190817AA7VlWA">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhA_HxXLN47WOOu7tBaeoSGY8gt.?qid=20070104185828AAHDpPJ">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070104193257AACwwJS&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHwIr1vEu0ySQ2iqwpgscw9Co3e.09QmlYuR1Uv7JBQKYXZ2YNVd18AXoTfeix5iB4OnQ--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
AA11498913	Molly, the camel <br>  <br>  A new US Army Captain by the name of Sherman Williford was assigned to an outfit in a remote post in the African desert. <br>   <br>  During his first inspection of the outfit, he noticed a camel hitched up behind the mess tent. He asks the First Sergeant why the camel is kept there. <br>  <br>  "Well sir, as you know, there are 250 men here on the post and no women. And sometimes the men have "urges." That's why we have Molly, the camel." <br>  <br>  Sherman says, "I can't say that I condone this, but I understand about "urges." The camel can stay." <br>  <br>  About a month later, the Cpt Williford starts having his own "urges" and asks the First Sergeant to bring the camel to his tent. Putting a ladder behind the camel, the Captain stands on the ladder, pulls his pants down and has wild, insane sex with Molly. When he's done, he asks the First Sergeant, "Is that how the men do it?" <br>  <br>  No not really, sir. "They usually just ride the camel into town where the girls are." <br>   <br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...   <br>   <br>   <br>  my kind of woman!!!!<br>   <br>  Jennifer's wedding day was fast approaching.<br>  Nothing could damper her excitement<br>  --not even her parent's nasty divorce.<br>  Her mother had found the perfect dress to wear and would<br>  be the best dressed mother-of-the bride ever!<br>  A week later, Jennifer was horrified to learn that her father's<br>  new younger wife had bought the exact same dress!!!<br>   <br>  Jennifer asked her to exchange it, but her step-mother refused<br>  "Absolutely not!

After all, it's your special day."<br>   <br>  A few days later, they went shopping and did find another gorgeous dress. When they stopped for lunch, Jennifer asked her mother. "Aren't you going to return the other dress? You don't have another occassion where you could wear it.<br>   <br>  Her mother just smiled and replied, "Of course I do, dear!

The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains" I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and vice-versa." Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now somewhat agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer that you'll ask me, I will pay you $500!." Figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references.He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows. All to no avail. Afterover an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500. The blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.|`|87d532f0f3005dc368d431ef1ca0d6a3aa	This guy needs a job and decides to apply at the zoo.

He needs the money, <br>  so he puts on the skin and goes out into the cage. <br>  The people all cheer to see him. He plays up to the audience <br>  and they just eat it up. <br>  This isn't so bad, he thinks, and he starts really putting on a show,<br>  jumping around, beating his chest and roaring, swinging around. <br>  During one acrobatic attempt, though, he loses his balance <br>  and crashes through some safety netting, <br>  landing square in the middle of the lion cage! <br>  As he lies there stunned, the lion roars. <br>  He's terrified and starts screaming, "Help, Help, Help!" <br>  The lion races over to him, places his paws on his chest <br>  and hisses, "Shut up or we'll BOTH lose our jobs!|`|d2ebcfe54be55de47ed8c1bde3c31f9caa	A woman had a parrot that she took with her everywhere she went.<br>  She would even take the parrot to the club with her when she went<br>  dancing and drinking on Saturday nights.

The crowd on the dance floor would always<br>  cheer and holler in appreciation when the parrot would yell.

You guys should too, and if we get the same thing tomorrow, we'll drown ourselves in the lake." They all agreed. The next day, they open up their lunches and...had peanut butter jelly sandwiches.

I have 2 blonde jokes of my own:<br>  <br>  3 ladies worked in a buisiness.  One had red hair, one had brown, and the third was a blonde.  Every day, their boss would go home early.  One day, the redhead said, "Why don't we go home right after the boss leaves.  She'll never know because she's not here anyway.  I have to water my garden anyway."  The brunette said, "Yeah, an dI have to go shopping."  The blonde said, "And I'll just go home to relax!"  So they decided to go home early and not tell their boss.  When the blonde gets home, she sees her boss and her husband having an affair, so she runs back to work.  The next day, the brunette says, "That was so much fun!  Let's do that again another day!"  TO this the blonde replies, "Not me!  I almost got caught!"<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A blonde and a brunette owned a farm.   One day, the brunette said that she would go purchase a bull from the market, and would send the blonde a telegram when she should meet her in the store.  So off the brunette went to purchase the bull.  She had $300, and the bull was $299.  The telegram machine cost $1 per word, so with her remaining dollar, she sent her sister a telegram saying, "Comfortable."  The manager asked why she did this, and the brunette said, "My sister's a blond.  She'll read it slowly."<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  HOPE YOU GOT A LAUGH OUT OF THIS!!!!|`|AA12148418	the best thing that happended to me today thanks!<br>  Star to you!|`|IgxaLXYCaa	You know...I have never heard any of these before...I am laughing a lot right now and I thank you!|`|jIA1ecJAaa	I like the escalator one...|`|3dQdBDlEaa	I loved it, those were great<br>  tx for the laugh and have a great day...=-)|`|AA11879003	those are hilarious! i cant seem to get the last one though....|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	lol...i love blonde jokes...|`|AA11829741	some really good one|`|GtzVw9gcaa	THATS FUNNY IM GONNA LAUGH NOW     HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH|`|ggDa3jD5aa	lol

a95561408cde4602d4b1aa2ef1dbd35daa	Je le dis souvent, Cort fait des instruments avec un excellent rapport qualité-prix (d'ailleurs, les usines Cort fabriquent aussi certaines Ibanez et certaines Fender).<br>  <br>  Pour la liste des endorsés Cort: <a href="http://www.cort.co.kr/english/artist/players.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cort.co.kr/english/artist/pla...</a>|`|PbcGDnhXaa	c'est pas mal, bon rapport qualite prix|`|3odKqb4Yaa	c'est parfait au niveau qualité prix. j'ai une folk cort qui est énorme vu son prix.<br>  par contre j'ai pas souvent vu des pros en utiliser mais bon tout le monde ne peut pas se payer une gibson|`|623e22d9daa399988beef1d916f6d68baa	Dans le même ordre de prix tu as aussi des Hamer fabriquées en Asie (série Slammer), et à mon avis pour le rock c'est un tout autre niveau que Cort.

616fd9b21656119edf42b4113fcd0437aa	L'histoire est assez compliquée à expliquer, car la trame principale est dévoilée d'une manière assez elliptique (puis de retour en arrière). Alors grosso modo, la terre est régulièrement attaquée par de méchants extra-terrestres. Ils sont grands, très grands, avance doucement, très doucement, mais ils sont surtout de plus en plus difficiles à combattre. Alors première remarque, les aliens sont assez laids. Sans réelle originalité, il ressemble à des bestioles vues et revues à travers les films de SF des années 60 ou d'autres dessins animés.<br>  <br>  Alors au milieu de cette guerre, il y a des scientifiques qui remettent en état (ce n'est pas très clair) un super alien. Manque de pot, à peine branchée, la machine échappe à leur contr?le et s'en va. Au même moment, les militaires prennent d'assaut le labo et constatent les dégats.<br>  Notre antihéros, Takt Kaneshiro, assiste à tout ce cirque et surtout à la disparition de sa chère et tendre, Maki Agata qui était assistante dans le laboratoire détruit.<br>  Notre super alien s'en va faire un tour à la campagne et semble bien invincible (il a pourtant été reconstruit, donc détruit une fois.). Il y rencontre une gamine légèrement attardée et commence à éprouver quelques sentiments. Il prend le nom de Frank.<br>  Pendant ce temps, Takt change d'identité et devient Ruy Soma. Il est agent double infiltré dans le FUNERAL, service du gouvernement qui a remis la main sur le robot Frank. Mais Takt est approché par un représentant du Malain.

HReBWI6qaa	I'm honestly uncomfortable with it.  I become appalled when I hear people say that a fetus is not a living thing and what not and I'm completely against partial-birth abortion.  However, I realize that the only person in this world that I can make decisions for is myself so I feel that it is also wrong for me to protest against it.  It is an issue that should be left to the communities and states rather than the federal government and I think women should explore all of their options before making a decision.  Adoption is preferable in my opinion but again, it isn't my decision to make.|`|ERRkUmWvaa	It depends on the circumstances, like rape and everything no way in hell should anyone have to go through pregnancy after already going through something like that.

d9tCS7BPaa	It would be an action/drama/western movie set in Mexico. It would be a plot similar to 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', — but with cinematography like Stanley Kubrick's. I would have Ennio Morricone do the music. Quentin Tarantino to write the dialogue and co-direct it along with Sophia Coppola. And it would star Benicio Del Toro and Penelope Cruz.<br>  <br>  It would be a movie about a few characters with interwoven lives and there are several family members trying to get revenge on one another. It would be violent, but would look pretty.|`|0lPt9xJTaa	I have been thinking this before..<br>  <br>  It's about a man who her high school best friend that is a girl who just didn't have a chance to tell his true feelings to her, showed up and she sets up a special date for her and the man two weeks later.<br>  <br>  Its time for this other girl, that has a total crush to the man, to do anything to let the man fall in love with her before the scheduled date from her high school friend and realize that she is the one who he love.|`|0427afd3b8a595188f3d1223ecf1fb2aaa	I'm ready.<br>  The first one would be small budget, inexpensive and for good actors.<br>  Since most of the best actors are out of work<br>  because special-effects nonsense is being made not adult movies for thinking humans, I'd have not trouble finding good people.<br>    I one made a list of types of inexpensive films to make--romances, cheap sci-fi, westerns without cattle herds, comedies with modern settings, cheap costume pictures, mysteries, modern setting spy films, courtroom movies, <br>  musicals without chorus girls, and films abut artists or other mostly-indoor professionals, etc.<br>  <br>  To save money, I'd write the script myself; and it would be heavy on dialogue, short on expensive outdoor actions scenes.  Remember "You've Got Mail"?<br>  Mine would be my western "A Gun For Abbie Dawn", which has few settings--a saloon, a corral, an hotel exterior, a restaurant, outdoor settings, an outdoor camp and a sheriff's office.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	I would do another true story about what makes us all inspired. How about a story of the first blind person to become a doctor.

It's about a boy named "Marsh" Mallow, who meets a girl and goes on some weird adventures with her.<br>  It was one of my favorite books when I was in junior high school. A messed up coming of age story.<br>  It would be a good one for one of the Jonas brothers to star in, as it would have to be aimed at the early teen aged group. Maybe with Miley Cyrus as the girl. But then again I can't stand prima Donna's, so maybe I'd go with unknown kids.<br>  But I'd have to have Steve Buscemi in there as Marsh's dad or a school counselor.

4745e20bdae353c02ef805a65d11fd36aa	La fotografía además de causar sensaciones al espectador así como tristeza, soledad, miedo, alegría y todas esas sensaciones que sentimos al ver una película segun la iluminación, el ángulo o la ubicación de la cam, sirve para la continuidad de las escenas, ya que en las fotografías se basan para recordar donde estaban ubicados los personajes, los objetos, las lueces, que hora era dentro de la película etc etc, te imaginas estar viendo una escena en exterior donde se supone que eran las ocho de la ma?ana y repentinamente en un cambio de escena parecen las dos dela tarde, eso quitaría credibilidad a la escena y es para otra cosa que sirve la fotografía.<br>  La fotografía cinematográfica es como una obra de arte.|`|1313c11bf18e64f6bdbdbddb98abd8e3aa	Muy buenas las respuestas anteriores, y creo que es válido agregar también el factor "color". Prestá atención a momentos en que, por ejemplo, una escena es triste, los colores que los directores de fotografía utilizan para la misma son tonos apagados, fríos y opacos, abundando muchas veces el gris o el *****. Pero ocurre todo lo contrario cuando la escena es alegre. Obviamente, está todo relacionado, ya que la luz se usa también para poder lograr el tono deseado en los colores, así que... <br>  Saludos y Suerte!!!|`|3db80abd20b60ca1c389e4713ff0734eaa	mirando detenidamente sus caracteristicas|`|79cc6bc507d0be95e4a22b0fd5386460aa	Geniales rtas!,no hay mas que decir,solo que ,ademas de lo que nombraron,hay paisajes que 1 sin saber dice,"Mira que fotografia!",obvio los que no sabemos de tecnicas,y 1 aprecia lo que comunmente vemos en postales.|`|06d935244d2ea0ae65c18817fff087c7aa	Muy buena tu pregunta, el trabajo de fotografía tiene que ver con el trabajo de las luces en los escenarios, mucho depende la iluminación para el toque que quieras darle a la escena y también en gran parte te ayuda a contar la historia, depende mucho de qué tipo de historia vas a contar, por ejemplo, las películas de gangsters si te das cuenta, usan tonos oscuros. Es más o menos lo que sé del tema, ojalá te haya ayudado. Saludos!!!|`|2abdeb1796d65ac591e70eab393c5315aa	El director de fotografía es la persona que determina como se va a ver la película, es decir es quien determina, en función de las exigencias del director y de la historia, los aspectos visuales del film: el encuadre, la iluminación, la óptica a utilizar, los movimientos de cámara, etc. Es el responsable de toda la parte visual del film, también desde el punto de vista conceptual, determinando la tonalidad general de la imagen y la atmósfera óptica de la película.<br>  El equipo de fotografía es el más numeroso y se compone del camarógrafo, el primer asistente de cámara o foquista, el segundo asistente de cámara, el cargador de negativos, el gaffer o jefe de eléctricos, los eléctricos u operadores de luces, los grip u operadores de travelling o dolly, los estabilizadores de cámara (Steady cam) y otros asistentes o aprendices|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	Si no estoy equivocada, creo que la respuesta más acertada hasta ahora es la que se refiere a los efectos de luz y sombras. Creo que es muy común confundir la dirección de fotografía con la dirección de arte y ambientación. Con la relación a los colores, también está relacionado al efecto lumínico. Una sola vez en mi vida tuve la oportunidad de estar en un set de filmación de un corto. El director de fotografía, controlaba la luz de cada toma (con un medidor) e indicaba al director cómo poner la cámara, en qué momento hacer cada toma. Pero el director de arte, junto con el vestuarista y escenógrafo armaban la escena (se hacen dibujos de cuadro por cuadro, como si fuera un cartoon). Por eso muchas veces la gente dice, qué buena fotografía tiene esta película, cuando en realidad se están refiriendo a la escenografía y a la dirección de arte.|`|XKopt6dzaa	no es una facil pero tampoco imposible, los mejores momentos de una pelicula para apreciar su fotografia es el momento en que nos muestras imagenes sin mucho movimiento, primeros planos, planos lejanos, contrapiques entre otros, la iluminacion es muy importante y puede llegar a definir la sensacion q nos genera la imagen, ademas de la dispocicion de los cuerpos y muchas otras cosas.|`|c198e8bc8484ac5060ce7237d01a5df8aa	La fotografía en la película -y lo que se premia en la Academia- es basicamente como se ambienta una escena en particular, dependiendo de lo que se quiera mostrar o conseguir en el espectador. Un ejemplo? si en la escena interviene algo de pena o dolor, buscando que todo sea calmo, será iluminado con un peque?o velador o un candelabro, para obtener Temperaturas color de 3200 oK que cumplirían con esa funcion,|`|C9tzJTJ3aa	Hay dos actores manteniendo un dialogo, en un living.Esa es la puesta del director de arte. El fotografo ilumina la escena con una lámpara y crea un clima que tiene que ver con la charla, en la toma el irector no ve (a veses pasa) un elemento que "ensucia" la toma, lo corrije y despues esta la foto fija, ahora cómo saber si es buena? si el personaje llora ?puede estar iluminado a todo color? ( a veses sí) o espreferible una luz intimista? y el plano debe ser corto o debe ser largo? depende del director pero el fotografo tiene ingerencia, si lo dejan ( si es bueno o malo, es otra cosa) Un Maestro del cine y soberbio fotogáfo?Bergman|`|642cd1517fbd834042c713909ea0e1feaa	pues.. si ves la pelicula la casa de las dagas voladoras entenderas lo que es fotografia.. te la recomiendo demasiado ( por su fotografía)

ZyGyDLsDaa	A History of Violence (2005)<br>  starring Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes, Stephen McHattie, Kyle Schmid, Aidan Devine<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  In Millowbrook, Indiana, the mild Tom Stall owns a bar and has a calm life with his beloved wife Edie, his teen-aged son Jack, and his little daughter Sarah. His life turns upside-down when her kills two cold-blooded killers in his bar to protect his waitress, becoming a local hero and being shown in the front page of the local news and on TV. The next day, mobster Carl Fogarty comes to the town, calling him Joey Cusack and telling that he was a former hitman. When Carl and his men threaten his family, Tom defends them, and violence is released in a chain reaction.<br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=AU&hl=en-GB&v=eXPzynrJfqM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=AU&hl=en...</a>|`|aayS2jnAaa	I know for a fact that it is not butterfly effect.

Dura-coat is very popular..you can laser-etch and other applications.<br>  <br>  Google it..you'll come up with lots of options.  Do not use spray paint!  Look to glock forums for customer feedback.

If you didn't do it legally, chances are you can be traced, and the people who shared the files with you will be less likely to get caught. If you did do it legally, then you have to make sure that files have the right extension (such as .doc or .zip at the end of the file) for the right program. If you have a file that says ".qt" at the end, you have to have Quicktime. If it's ".wmv," it has to be Windows Media Player. Hope it helps.

AA10590624	What does it take to be a mother, a wife and a daughter-in-law? Estella (Lorna Tolentino) is facing some serious problems in this regard. Relationship with her mother-in-law Miling, a teacher (Nida Blanca), is strained and living with her who also supports her family has not been easy.  For years, husband Daniel (Albert Martinez), on the insistence of his mother, has been unsuccessfully looking for a job on board a ship. While Estella, who has not finished even grade one, ekes out a living as a market vendor. Miling has taken over Estella's family, insisting that Daniel try again to board a ship, even if she has to borrow money or pawn her valuables for him. She has taken over the care and supervision of her grandchildren and attributes this state of family affairs to her daughter-in-law, and has convinced her son to think so. She says that Stella is unreliable ("hindi maasahan"), useless ("walang silbi") and dumb ("tanga") or knows nothing. Miling sees her children's ambiguous attitude towards her, especially Beth, who has turned disrespectful. With dogged determination she sets out to regain her place in her family by trying to gather them around her.<br>  <br>  Tanging Yaman also wrote Abakada…Ina. Although, like the first film, carries a valuable, rich and universal subject – mothers – it is not at par with the best picture for year 2000. It lacks that certain cohesiveness and delineation in the story and characters to sufficiently touch the viewers. Nevertheless, the movie is an acceptably wholesome production.<br>  <br>  Abakada…Ina presents three portraits of three mothers and what has taken each of them to become a mother to her children. Are there basic requirements to be learned to be a mother, as there are the ABCs to learn to be able to read, write and know things? Some answers are given. Although there is nothing objectionable regarding-sexual issues, or drugs and alcohol, there are frequent verbal harassment/abuse and some physical violence.<br>  <br>  Abakada…Ina is recommended for classroom discussion on family and family relations. It is a rich source of subject matter to exchange ideas on and learn from. It is not only children who must honor their parents — parents must also honor their children.

ca4ca40760a65d74d4387db8fe2a3937aa	Hey give it time. When you are first starting out it can be boring, especially if you have no idea how to play the instrument. I suggest you keep practicing and when you feel more comfortable reading music, go to a music store and buy a beginner book for alto sax that also comes with an accompaniment C.D. so that you can play along. It is alot more fun that way. I am a clarinet player and that is what I did when I first started. I have been playing for 11 years and still love it.|`|AA11112418	Harder stuff like that on the first day? Not possible. You need to take it as you progress, and as the method book goes. In fact, if you don't have it, go get the Rubank Method-easy book. This series of method books is a great way to learn technical accuracy and skill on the saxophone, and it will work with you all the way into college.

That season has since sold out and they only had at the time season 1, 4 and 6, they only have 1 and 4 now though, plus i wanted them all so im searching around and found a set on ebay, i think it includeds the finale, i hope so anyway, its i think 128 dollars all together, is that a good deal you think, how much did you pay for yours?  The ones at walmart are 20 dollars a piece , but like i said, they only have 2 seasons now and i want to buy them all together, im going to get on thier website though, but go to amazon, i was thier hours ago and it was saying free shipping for orders over the next 48 hours, so look into it, maybe save n the shipping, but ebay usually has everything and im thinking i seen soom on thier today, so good luck on finding that finle, also check www.dawsonscreek.com they sell the seasons and everything on thier, but i pulled up season 1 and it was like 40 dollars, so thier expensive, put they have it.

aa2f80403dc31ff8816cbe8c5d1bd389aa	No matter what Simon likes to say about it being a singing competition, the show is called American Idol, not American Singer.  Charisma, looks and overall talent are just as important as singing.  You only have to look as far as Brittany Spears to see it isn't just about the voice.  I do agree Daughtry should have won last year, but he got his revenge as he is vastly outselling all the other Idols.|`|b8924a7a234d259f5d36a8d7d6d47ff8aa	How the voting goes:<br>  <br>  Let's say there are 100 voters, to make it easier to explain.<br>  <br>  80 people like Ann the best, Betty second, Carol third, Dan last.<br>  17 people like Dan the best, Carol second, Ann third, and Betty last.<br>  2 people like Carol first, Dan second, Ann third, and Betty last.<br>  1 person likes Betty first, Ann second, Dan third, Carol last.<br>  <br>  So even though more people like Betty better than Dan, Dan got more votes, because we only vote for first place! So Betty gets kicked off the show! Only one vote for first place for her, even though 81 liked her better than Carol and Dan.<br>  <br>  So, this is how someone who's the second favorite of almost everyone can get kicked off, while someone that more people don't like gets to stay.|`|AA11952563	they say its a talent competition...but that's a complete lie.  they base alot of it on looks.

She wasn't a good singer, but because she was good looking she made it far.<br>  and you have in season 4,Scott Savol....he was terrible....and he wasn't attractive...but i think people wanted to keep him on there because he was terrible and to make people mad.<br>  <br>  Same thing with Christ Daughtry, he was an amazing singer, and he actually isn't bad to look at either, but there were better looking contestants that people wanted to keep in there, and didn't care that he was better than the other contestants.<br>  <br>  And sometimes, i can never even get into vote! i know one year, season 2, i never got in one time for Clay.

be6ab88dea467cf8efe6b576542494c3aa	If you type www.mp3real.ru into your address bar it'll take you to a Russian website that has quite a bit of music of different varieties. There should be a bar across the screen containing the various letters of the alphabet... click on a letter and it'll take you to a list of bands. Click on the band's name and it'll take you to a list of albums. Click on the name of the album you want and it'll take you to a list of songs. Click on the "mp3" link next to the song you want and you should be able to download the song.<br>  <br>  Of course, when downloading anything off the internet you should be careful about spyware and trojan horses and all that. Personally, I've never had problems with this site, but that's no guarantee. If you want completely safe songs, many musicians post songs on their personal web sites.

bb3de3ca6513172530fef5133f6bc55caa	I'll try and give you as best a reason as I can. This is, of course, my own personal opinion.<br>  <br>  Stanwyck starred in almost a hundred films during her career and received four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress: Stella Dallas (1937), Ball of Fire (1941), Double Indemnity (1944), and Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). <br>  <br>  When Stanwyck's film career declined at age 50 in 1957 she moved to television. Her 1961–1962 series The Barbara Stanwyck Show was not a ratings success but earned the star her first Emmy Award. The 1965–1969 series The Big Valley made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. Twenty years later, she earned her third Emmy for The Thorn Birds.<br>  <br>  Stanwyck hit her peak in the 1940s, alternating between comic roles, in classics such as "The Lady Eve" (1941) and "Ball of Fire" (1941), and tough femme fatale parts in "Double Indemnity" (1944) and "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" (1946). Most of her characters were strong-willed and feisty, holding their own against, and even dominating, their male counterparts in film after film. That was what made her so powerful and influential. She paved the way for women to play a multitude of different characters instead of the usual Suzy Homemaker or hysterical, flighty woman roles. <br>  <br>  In 1944 the IRS claimed that Stanwyck was the highest-paid woman in the USA, with an annual salary of $400,000

It reminds me of a John Lennon song that says "life is what happens to you while your busy making other plans". That's what happened to George -- life -- while he was busy PLANNING something else.

He realized that he was essential in other people lives. He saved his brother's life. He had a loving family and friends. He made a huge impact on others even though he never realized it before. Ever wonder what impact or how you influence other people's lives? Believe it or not the smallest things are worth the most. Whether it is a hug or a simple smile.

6291ffb2e8083ad82d6e6f85f69b35c0aa	back when Nirvana was doing their thing, lots of bands sounded like them.  From memory, there was Smashing Pumpkins, Mudhoney, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, L7, early Pearl Jam, Soundgarden...<br>  <br>  But Nirvana was actually pretty good.  Instead of looking for bands that SOUND like them, you ought to listen to bands that were really good or that influenced them.  For example, Sonic Youth, the Melvins, the Meat Puppets, Violent Femmes, the Raincoats, the Pixies, the Vaselines- Kurt Cobain used to name lots of bands publicly that he supported or that influenced him.  You'll probably have more luck finding good music this way than by looking for bands that sound like them.|`|0000b4af913d9f5d5e3c7da839aa3cfbaa	smashing pumpkins,anything from the mellon collies album,the melvins,alice in chains,sonic youth slightly.|`|wZp8Ldpnaa	metallica, megadeth too|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	Uh...I always get Song 2 by Blur mixed up with Smells Like Teen Spirit.

e57acbf667c5682d84955775fc361fa2aa	SPOILER WARNING*<br>  <br>  As the age of piracy nears its end, a new threat arrives in Port Royal—the East India Trading Company. Guiding the company's monopolistic expansion in the Caribbean is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a powerful and ruthless EITC agent. Beckett intends to eradicate all pirate activity from the area. To this end, he arrests Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) shortly before their wedding ceremony, threatening to execute them and the absent ex-Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport) for abetting Captain Jack Sparrow's escape. What Beckett really wants, however, is Sparrow and his magical compass, and he coerces Will into searching for both by offering clemency.<br>  <br>  While Elizabeth languishes in jail, Will frantically searches for Jack. An informant in Tortuga leads him to the Black Pearl that is run aground on Pelegosto, a cannibal-inhabited island where Jack and his crew are captive. Jack had hidden there after being visited by his former crew mate, "Bootstrap Bill" Turner, who is now an indentured sailor on the ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman. Bootstrap delivered the Black Spot to Jack, a mark that his debt to Davy Jones is due. Thirteen years previously, Jones raised the Black Pearl from the ocean floor and made Jack the captain. In exchange, Jack must now serve aboard the Dutchman for 100 years or face Jones' leviathan, the Kraken.<br>  <br>  Will, Jack and the crew escape, unexpectedly recruiting Pintel and Ragetti as they are attempting to commandeer the Pearl, and head to sea. Jack has been searching for a key that leads to untold riches, but his magical compass fails to work for him. Jack agrees to give Will the compass if he helps him find the key and what it unlocks. Seeking assistance from Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), a voodoo priestess, Jack learns the compass will not work because he does not know what he truly wants—or he knows what it is and is unable to claim it as his own. The key, Tia tells him, unlocks the Dead Man's Chest containing Davy Jones' beating heart. When the pain of lost love was too much to bear, Jones carved it from his chest and buried it. Whoever possesses the heart controls Davy Jones, thereby controlling the oceans. Back at sea, the Flying Dutchman encounters Sparrow, who deviously attempts to barter Will in exchange for himself. But Jones demands 100 souls within three days for Jack’s freedom and keeps Will as a "good faith payment."<br>  <br>  In Port Royal, Governor Weatherby Swann frees Elizabeth. Confronting Beckett at gunpoint, she forces him to validate a Letter of Marque—a document with which he intends to recruit Sparrow as a privateer and that Elizabeth wants for Will. Stowing away on a merchant vessel, Elizabeth lands in Tortuga where she finds Jack and Gibbs recruiting unsuspecting sailors in a pub. A fallen James Norrington also applies. Blaming Sparrow for his ruin, he tries to shoot the captain and ignites a brawl. Elizabeth knocks him out to save him from the angry mob. At the dock, Jack reveals the compass' secret to Elizabeth; it points to what the holder wants most in the world. When he convinces her that she can save Will by finding the chest, she uses it and gets a bearing. Once the ship is underway, tension arises between Jack and Elizabeth when each discovers the compass now points to the other. It is unclear if they desire one another or if each seeks the other as a means to obtain what they truly want.<br>  <br>   <br>  Jack Sparrow opens the Dead Man's Chest containing Davy Jones' heart.On Isla Cruces, Jack, Norrington, and Elizabeth find the Dead Man's Chest. Will, who has escaped the Dutchman with help from his father, Bootstrap Bill, arrives with the key. Will wants to stab the heart to free his father, but a three-way duel erupts between Jack, Norrington, and Will, each claiming it for himself; leading to a battle at an old mill resulting in the mill wheel breaking off and rolling away with Will and Norrington fighting atop it with Jack chasing after them to get the key. Jack climbs onto the moving wheel, gets the key and hoists himself off the wheel (using a passing palm tree) just before it rolls down a slope, picking up speed. Jack opens the chest and takes Davy Jones's heart back to the beach, where he puts the heart in the jar of sand. The Dutchman sailors reach the beach and Norrington manages to escape with the heart and the Letter of Marque. Jones’ crewmen retrieve the chest, unaware it is empty.<br>  <br>   <br>  Jack Sparrow battles the Kraken.The Flying Dutchman pursues the Black Pearl, but with the wind behind them, the Pearl outruns the Dutchman. Jones ends the pursuit and instead summons the Kraken. In a moment of cowardice, Jack abandons the ship in a longboat while they're under attack, but unable to desert his crew, he returns in time to save them. He gives the order to abandon ship before the Kraken returns for its final assualt. ?Realizing the Kraken is hunting Jack, a deceptive Elizabeth passionately kisses him while handcuffing him to the mast, telling him that she is not sorry. Racked with guilt over her deceit, she tells the others Jack chose to remain behind, unaware Will witnessed what happened. Jack manages to free himself and charges the Kraken right into its maw, and the colossal beast drags him and the Pearl to a watery grave. Watching from his ship, Davy Jones declares their debt settled, but he becomes enraged when he discovers that the chest is empty, and roars, "DAMN YOU, JACK SPARROOOOW!"<br>  <br>  Arriving in Port Royal, Norrington presents the heart and the Letter to Lord Beckett in a bid to regain his career. Cutler Beckett now controls the seas.<br>  <br>  The grieving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma. Consoling them, she asks if they would sail to the World's End to return Jack and the Black Pearl. When they agree, she says they will need a captain who knows those waters. Incredibly, the formerly dead Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) descends the stairs, eating an apple and asks what's become of his ship.<br>  <br>  After the credits, we find out what happened to the dog the cannibals chased after eariler in the film.|`|14350bbe3b7844f43f9a3a30a7848a29aa	I don't know if there is a plot.

DBZ, since it is liscenced in the United States, cannot be distributed in it's English version online, except by the liscencing company itself. While ADV has launced a downloading service for some of its releases, FUNimation, the company that owns DBZ, has not. While there are some downloads  of the English subbed version lurking about the net in places such as www.animedownloads.com, you won't find an English version.

GgbmHDWRaa	It varies. Like all jobs, there are the top notch ones, the average ones and the not-too-great ones. Very good makers who win awards in violin-making competitions (VSA, Stradivari, etc) will make violins that are highly in demand and can sell for tens of thousands! A poorly made violin will only sell for hundreds. Since most violin-makers are self-employed, how much they make highly depends of the quality of the violin and the amount produced.|`|AA10892874	Starting pay is $9.05 per hour down at the Acme Violin Works.|`|65a65e2f7ffe57bc5910c2800b1849c4aa	I saw a docu on Discovery Channel about a guy who makes two per year and his violins sell for about $100,000 each.

3cbR2R2Maa	i havent seen the movie or the songs. i just did a www.limewire.com search for it and you are right,it is a georgous sound.i dont know if there is a singer that i can think of that would match the sound you seek. the only two female recordists that come to mind that could touch this sound is "enya" or maybe "amy lee" but  this womans voice sounds operatic,,not sure if thats the correct term or not. i would search out choir type music as a source for your sound,,perhaps even benedictus like allegri.

ade7b43bd34ef6780a2f8edb19c1d5feaa	you hold the bow in your hand kinda like you plan to play it------placing the 1st digit of your thumb under the hair then draw the strands across the resin a few times-full length|`|pnResFTsaa	To apply rosin to your bow, my favorite way to put it on is to hold the rosin in your lef hand, and the bow in your right, like you are playing. Then gently move the bow up and down against the rosin. You have to repeat this many times. In other words, pretend like the rosin is the strings, and you are playing it. A good way to tell when you have enough is to tap the bow hair on a dark surface. If a white mark is left, you have enough. Also, if the bow hair is a bright white color, you have enough.

9db8ce1e3fb9c8f24ea894f2904aa3e5aa	According to Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  In late 2005 Dido began recording her third solo album, experimenting with different sounds and producers, including Jon Brion in Los Angeles. The album was originally expected to be released in late 2006, but Dido has stated on her official website that the album will be released in early 2007. In the February 2007 edition of Q magazine, it is stated that album will drop in Autumn 2007. It also tells that Dido was inspired by long drives along the Pacific Coast of California. February 18: Direct-Current.net reported that the street date circulated by Sony BMG is now September 18. The album was delayed due to the death of her father.

94bb8bb190d9795a1e2c10797f28acaeaa	Just a guess, but I'd remove the strings and tuners, mask the neck, bridge, and nut, and then use some high gloss spray paint.  It the current finish is very shiny, I'd take off the gloss with some fine steel wool, before painting it.  Good luck.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	with paint|`|CaPNcD82aa	lightly sand the surface that you wish to paint.apply a very thin coat of a laquer paint, this can be purchased at musicshops, or look up this on such magazines as accoustic guitar magazine, make sure that each coat is very thin, then put on layer after layer, the more laquer you apply, the harder the surface will be, thus preventing nicks from your pick or belt buclke.|`|44885b952378fc9f7120400e76cbefe1aa	As mentioned, it will affect the acoustics.

Old worn guitars are classic.|`|a2241d9e0f57b29fa67b98f6ffbf458baa	what kind of wood is it made of, thats most important!!<br>  also painting it wrong will change the sound of it. like if you sand it down to much in one spot it becomes thinner on that spot and the echo is off when you strum it. i would not suggest you paint it yourself rather find somone to do it for you that knows what they are doing and have them paint it just the way you like it!!|`|q1gECbs0aa	Don't paint it! Old worn guitars look great. Plus painting it could damage the acoustic nature of the wood. Maybe sand it, restain it and put a nice light coat of polyurethane over it. What kind is it? If it's a good brand (ie: Gibson, Martin etc) don't ruin it!|`|0BMzLTVpaa	1st strip old varnish off.<br>  2nd fine sand your instrument<br>  3rd choose which ever stain you like<br>  4th use several coats of polyurethane to get the acoustic sound you are looking for<br>  <br>  add some artistic abilities to your art work, and<br>  make sure not to sand beyond the outer wood surface too much|`|1e657b01822bdda51364df534c4ac612aa	Im not sure if there are any steps involved.  I would think all you need to do is get some paint and start, but i did find a site that you can go to for information, its <a href="http://home.flash.net/~guitars/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.flash.net/~guitars/index.htm...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10728684	I would suggest going to a hobby shop and take a look at some air-brush guns.

Maybe make it more customized and detailed.|`|WQh2OqZpaa	why would you want to paint it!!!!!! you sound like a friend of mine. he likes to paint things to hes in the process of painting his guitar as well. if i was u i would go careful and make sure you get the right paint.|`|e1d94deb080d8b4c7483f211efa55159aa	I would suggest you start by sanding it and end by putting some kind of sealant or finish on.

El mismo precipicio por el que el Coyote caía acompa?ado por un silbido y acogido por una nube de polvo, cual metáfora animada, cada vez que el Correcaminos lograba escapar. <br>  <br>  El Coyote es listo, taimado y principalmente ilustrado en ciencias varias. El Coyote está doctorado en ciencias políticas, empresariales, telecos, caminos, química, física y tiene un cursillo de macramé para animales. <br>  <br>  De otro modo y sin ser McGyver, ?cómo consigue alguien armar una bomba con piezas ACME con esa rapidez? Además, habla siete idiomas, de los cuales seis están muertos y el séptimo es un idioma extraterrestre que sólo domina él y Carlos Jesús, de ahí que no diga una palabra en pantalla. <br>  <br>  El Correcaminos es sólo un put.o avestruz con plumas azules<br>  <br>  Y así se inicia la metáfora. ?Por qué el Coyote, siendo tan listo, no se iba a comer a un tahilandés dónde le sirviesen avestruz? <br>  <br>  Fácil: la pertinaz persecución en pos del Correcaminos es el símbolo de la perseverancia humana, la voluntad de perseguir aquellas metas que no consientes descartar, la búsqueda de la realización a través de la autosuperación. <br>  <br>  El mundo gira gracias a aquellos que no se dejaron amilanar por las creencias mayoritarias, y que persiguieron SU verdad esquivando toda adversidad y oposición. Claro que el mundo también gira gracias a las patadas giratorias de Chuck Norris. <br>  <br>  Cientos de veces, el Coyote ponía todo su conocimiento en el paquete y jugueteaba con sustancias de lo más volátil que se convertirían en trampa mortal para su enemigo. <br>  <br>  El Correcaminos era el Everest del Coyote, su máxima aspiración, la culminación de los deseos de cualquier coyote mortal. El Correcaminos... simplemente corría caminos. Y emitía desquiciantes zumbidos ultrasónicos que destrozaba el placton marino y jodía la cadena alimentaria. Y sin embargo, lograba sobrevivir, esquivando las ingeniosas trampas urdidas por el Coyote por pura chiripa. <br>  <br>  Como puedes ver, la metáfora queda así lista, el más listo y voluntarioso caía por el precipicio mientras el Correcaminos quedaba encumbrado por su graciosa imbecilidad. La tragedia convertida en comedia infantil. <br>  <br>  En este mundo, muchos somos coyotes. Creemos que es la inteligencia, la sensibilidad o el esfuerzo lo que nos recompensará con dulces frutos cuando nuestras simientes broten, y vemos que ese orondo animal de bellota de nuestro jefe, incompetente dónde los haya, se come esos frutos. <br>  <br>  Pero hay esperanza para los que seguimos creyendo en la inteligencia, y esfuerzo como armas con las que pertrecharnos cuando salimos cada ma?ana al mundo, y tratamos de cazar a nuestro Correcaminos. Algún día dejará de correr ese bribón... ese sera el día que le reventaremos el cul.o a patadas.

Now director Tim Story can let the heroes out of their apartment for some real action.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	It was arguably Betty Davis's best movie, the story of a woman accused of breaking up a man's marriage and leading him to kill his wife, a crime for which he was sent to prison and she was sent away. The frase is in reference to the beauty of love shared between a man and a woman that they can have all this and heaven too which in this case will be when they can meet again in heaven as he dies in prison. It is around about way of saying their love will last forever. Of if you don't speak english then this makes no sense to you and neither did the novie which was filmed in english and has not been dubbed in foreign languages yet. In fact it is a difficult film to get a copy of.

Per questo ci "teniamo fuori".<br>  <br>  Un dirigente RAI lo ha dichiarato in una intervista qualche settimana fa|`|3NcvrpGMaa	Perchè l'Italia ha perso i mondiali nel 1986?

I've watched some painful performances by any number of backgrounds, so the last part of your question is not one I can truly respond to.

It was hilarious, In April or May before school ended she said something really funny..A kid was making uhhh *sex moaning sounds* Then Duvall said "Stop making the uuuhhhhh sound." The whole class laughed for like 20 minutes. Anyway yeah.I have this boring math teacher who is married to the art teacher, I've noticed how they are both different and similar. The math teacher is so boring man, she uses this FBI tone General American Accent. I hate her, but goodness I don't have her the whole year, just for one trimester. |`|mEMvRr4faa	My ICT teacher ( Computer teacher ) She was so damn annoying! she taught me for 3 years as well... I'm surprised I lasted without chucking something at her. She would try and belittle me in front of the class ( Didn't work ) and if i didn't do something right regarding the computers she would go off on me, if it was someone else in my situation she would have just spoke to them and helped them... I would understand if I was a problem child but I wasn't at all I always used my manners... did homework polite etc... I would just have a laugh with my friends in the class and she would immediately tell me to get out of the class for disruptive behavior!!! OMG I hate her! so glad i don't need to be bossed around anymore by that witch!! If i see her out anywhere, i'm going to give her the dirtiest look ever! WITCH<br>  <br>  Lmao pheww!|`|AA12325046	All of my teachers were great.  Back then I used to blame a lot of things on them when they were just trying to help me become a better student.

Some teachers are better than others and should be rewrded for it and commended.|`|y9Hkvn2Waa	Ms. Rudd, omg she was incredibly obnoxious & frustrating--she wasn't good at what she taught (English)...if someone asked her a question she would just start telling them off for not paying attention earlier.

There was no logical reason for it and if we didnt do it, she would minus points off our average.  I didnt learn one thing from her class that year at all.  She was constantly screaming at the class and if you missed a class because you were sick, she would take points off.  I must mention that this was over 25 years ago and times have changed.  If my kids had a teacher like that...OH BOY!  The school would not tolerate her today.  |`|fDh08Pd0aa	Fred Elbel, Ninth Grade Science.<br>  <br>  He was about 150 years old and had been trying to teach 14 year old kids something they didn't want to learn for about 120 years.<br>  <br>  He had no inspiration left.

fwHkjTN1aa	Those are awfully big shoes to fill, even if he has  awfully big feet. Bob Barker was the Johnny Carson of game shows..Drew's like Jay Leno taking over..nice guy...but no comparison...<br>  <br>  But two other things..I never thought he earned his place in show business all along. It's just as if it were handed to him.. I don't think his sit-com was that funny, and relied heavily on his supporting cast..In particular, I thought he was a dismal host of "Who's line is it anyway?",<br>  compared to the British Host who started with the show on Comedy Central.|`|6e2eebd498466699a4ceb47740f7b7cfaa	It's definitely lowered the ratings.

Once my hair reaches a certain length it just... stops... but recently I've started using Pantene Pro V "Beautiful Lengths" which is supposed to help strengthen your hair to help it grow. I can't say for certain if this works or not, but I've been using it for several months now and I see a difference in the length of my hair.  (They also make this type of shampoo/conditioner in Garnier Fructis if you prefer that over Pantene.)  Also, I've started taking a dietary supplement called Biotin that's supposed to help strengthen your hair and nails (to help grow) and improve your skin. I've noticed GREAT results by taking this pill once a day so I would highly recommend you taking this. You don't need a prescription for it and it's VERY cheap.  One more thing... if you straighten (with a hot iron) or blow dry your hair this could cause your hair to stop growing because it's damaged. If you're doing this, it's best to stop... but if you insist on the style, which is understandable, then just be sure to get a trim every now and then to eliminate split ends and keep your hair moisturized! Good luck!      ...Like others have been suggesting, take prenatal vitamins, which is what Biotin is.|`|SrRkciZKaa	bcuz it wants to kill u|`|kR0l2ypxaa	When you have split ends it is harder for hair to grow so i would definitely advise you to trim it. It doesn't have to be that much but enough to get rid of the split ends. Also try to avoid heating appliances such as a hair Straightener or blow dryer or when you do use them make sure you put on a protective product on before to well protect your hair. Be careful of what kind of Barret's and clips you use because those can also be harmful to your hair. Avoid perms and absolutely no peroxide! Also this could be a diet issue if your body isn't getting enough nutrients then neither is you hair. Along with that don't pile your hair on top of your head it is just asking for knots just apply shampoo directly on roots and work your way down. Cold water is actually the best water to wash you hair in because it allows the cuticles to lay flat and are less likely to snag and break (not to mention it boost shine and is easier to comb). Yes i know it sounds unappealing but it works trust me. And just a last tidbit that no matter what companies say the only way to salvage damaged hair is to cut it off! Hope this helps|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	you think alot.!!!|`|0uMLrKAbaa	trim them, eat vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs n drink milk.  use hair oil n good shampoo

d2e7c2d7846af88f95c33716cad1d8f2aa	mira encontre esto quiza te ayude:<br>  <br>  <br>  Subgénero Clase Z<br>  <br>  <br>  A fines de la década de 1950, se dio origen a un subgenero del cine B, el cine de clasificación Z, que tenía un presupuesto aún mas miserable y una edición más mala que su antecesor. Plan 9 From Outer Space, de Ed Wood, fue reconocida como primer película de serie Z que se hizo en la historia. Este film pretendía ser protagonizado por Bela Lugosi, pero al fallecer fue reemplazado por nada menos que el quiropráctico de la esposa de Ed Wood, que permaneció durante toda la película con un velo sobre su cara. A las naves espaciales se les podía ver claramente los hilos que las sujetaban y la trama puede llegar a ser la peor que se ha hecho en a?os.<br>  <br>  Véanse también peliculas de ninjas de la IFD Films & Arts en la década de 1980, otro buen ejemplo del estilo: absolutamente ningún tipo de efecto especial (aparte de humo), en el film venían dos historias totalmente distintas, forzadas a relacionarse entre sí, ya que se tomaban una pelicula previamente distribuida (únicamente en Asia) y se mezclaba con nuevas escenas de acción rodadas con actores caucásicos, habitualmente no profesionales, en ridículos trajes de Ninjas; el único rol que cumplían estos ninjas era ser insertados entre escenas, luchando y dialogando infantilmente, confundiendo la trama original de la película.<br>  <br>  Grandes personajes del cine Z pueden ser: Joseph Lai, Bruce Baron, Stuart Smith, Godfrey Ho y el supuesto "campeón de los Ninjas", Richard Harrison, actor americano con amplia experiencia en el cine europeo de los a?os 60 y 70, quién protagonizó alrededor de 20 películas bizarras de ninjas en los a?os '80, las cuales terminarían por arruinar su carrera. Afirma que su mayor contribución al cine ha sido rechazar el papel protagónico en el western Fistful Of Dollars, y haber recomendado a Clint Eastwood en su lugar.

No te presiones por ver tooodas las series que te encuentres porque te vas a hartar y aburrir.<br>  <br>  Sólo mira lo que te guste, no desde?es los animes viejitos sólo por ser de más allá d elos 90's y documéntate bien.<br>  <br>  Muchas veces la gente tacha a los fans del anime de ignorantes porque hablan sin saber ni queé onda... por eos mi recomendaciónd e ver más anime que sólo lod e moda o lo ma′s comentado...<br>  <br>  Salu2 =D

dfjIBHe3aa	American comics evolved out of American pulp magazines when they were at their most flamboyant.  This was the time of Captain Future, Doc Savage, the Shadow, Northwest Smith and the Bat and the Black Bat -- two detectives who disguised their identity with a familiar looking cowl.      While the Gladiator by Philip Wylie was not per se a pulp story it was in the same Science Fiction genre as, for example, Superman which it inspired.  His satire the Savage Gentleman performed the same service for Doc Savage, and the openings of his and Edwin Balmer's When Worlds Collide and Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon are very similar.    To make a long story short, in the sixties Stan Lee at Marvel Comics and (arguably) Julius Schwartz and Carmine Infantino at DC turned superheroes from a money loser to the most successful franchises in comics.  These were usually a combination of Science Fiction and the masked vigilante stories (which themselves were descended from the Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernal).  Within a few years you couldn't get a story published if it wasn't a superhero story.    Japanese Comics come from a different culture with an equally lively background, but not the same, and like comics until the sixties, do most of the genres of other popular fiction.

(Só a título de observa??o, em particular, n?o me agrada a anima??o japonesa, embora aprecie muitos mangás, portanto n?o escolhi nenhuma.)<br>  <br>  Bom essa é minha lista:<br>  <br>  1.A bela e a fera<br>  Representante dos clássicos Disney, até hoje, o único desenho indicado ao Oscar de Melhor Filme, n?o poderia deixar de ser meu primeiro lugar.<br>  <br>  2.Procurando Nemo<br>  Representante dos desenhos CGI da Pixar, esse lindo filme agrada a todos, e pra mim até agora, nesse gênero, só compete com A vida de inseto (mas talvez eu mude de idéia após assistir WALL-E).<br>  <br>  3.O estranho mundo de Jack<br>  Anima??o musical, com roteiro de Tim Burton, o famoso diretor de filmes sombrios como Edward M?os de tesoura. Foi lan?ado pela Touchstone Pictures, que é da Disney.<br>  <br>  4.As bicicletas de Belleville<br>  Essa anima??o francesa cult é belíssima. é um filme original, repleto de detalhes, com uma crítica à sociedade consumista e vazia. Mas que ninguém se engane: n?o é uma anima??o infantil.<br>  <br>  5.Batman do futuro - O retorno do Coringa<br>  Representando a DC/Warner, este filme teve o roteiro escrito por um dos caras mais criativos da atualidade: Paul Dini. Antes dos live-action de Nolan, O retorno do Coringa era considerado por muitos o melhor filme do Batman.|`|fLnSOw3daa	Byousoku 5 Centimeter - Tratando da qualidade da anima??o, esse realmente ganha, tem imagens incriveis, a anima??o eh mto mto mto bem feita.<br>  Sen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi (A Viagem de Chihiro) - esse eu gostei mto, desde a primeira vez q vi, logo no comecinho eu ja me apaixonei<br>  Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo - esse parece uma comedia simples, mas no final se torna qse um drama, muda completamente e fica mto legal =D<br>  Ratatoulle - esse eu tbm gostei, bem bonitinho ^^<br>  (Hmmm.................................... )<br>  O Rei Le?o - Meu preferido da Disney hehehe, mas eh legal sim, a historia do Simba, como ele sempre quis ser rei, mas depois ele fugiu de sua responsabilidade, ate saber lidar com a situa??o....|`|UeGnC2V8aa	na minha opini?o, nenhum supera * SHREK,<br>  gosto também de                         *A era do gelo<br>  Sem comentários para                 *Madagascar<br>  Meu filho adorou                          * O galinho Chicken Little<br>  e eu colocaria aí pra fechar           *Vida selvagem<br>  <br>  Abra?os.|`|5Ur5rd5jaa	.Wall-E<br>  .Procurando Nemo<br>  .A Família do Futuro<br>  .Madagáscar<br>  .Shrek|`|Xi0rMRItaa	Oieee <br>  eu gostei muito dos:<br>  *Os sem floresta<br>  *A era do gelo<br>  *Deu a louca do chapéuzinho vermelho<br>  *Toy story<br>  *Madagascar<br>  *Os incriveis<br>  *A batalha dos vegetais<br>  *A fuga das galinhas<br>  *shrek<br>  é s?o esses ai ate mais bj?o|`|9rlcRJYyaa	Tem que ser só anima??o em 3D?<br>  <br>  Pois eu prefiro os mais clássicos...<br>  Na minha opini?o é:<br>  <br>  A Bela e a Fera<br>  Rei Le?o<br>  A Pequena Sereia<br>  Branca de Neve e os Sete An?es<br>  Procurando Nemo|`|613828731925e4d96385b1ba89e69293aa	em cg axo q o melhor de todos os tempos é <br>  PROCURANDO NEMO<br>  mas tem outros, era do gelo<br>  final fantasy adventure childrem<br>  ca?adores de drag?o<br>  carros<br>  e outros ai. menos shrek 3 q é uma porcaria|`|9c1cf81c072145a0539b2212a0897afdaa	→A era do gelo<br>  →Kung fu panda<br>  →Resident evil 4<br>  →Ratatouille<br>  →Os Incriveis|`|otBxhoE2aa	-A lenda beowulf<br>  -O segredo dos animais<br>  -Ratatouille<br>  -Deu a louca na chapeuzinho<br>  -Madagascar|`|JqiwrNX6aa	Toy Story<br>  Madagascar<br>  Deu a louca na chapeuzinho<br>  A casa monstro<br>  Um estranho no formigueiro|`|uWH53TQJaa	gostei muito da Era do Gelo.|`|3oK5N9tIaa	Minha opini?o:<br>  <br>  'Procurando Nemo' no 1<br>  pode ser descrito em apenas uma palavra: extraordinário. Mesmo que você n?o goste de anima??es, vale a pena ver esse filme.<br>   <br>  Associada a Pixar, o estúdio conseguiu o feito de produzir um dos desenhos mais lindos e detalhados que eu já vistos - mesmo sabendo que tudo foi feito no computador. A história n?o tem nada de novo: o peixinho Nemo é capturado por humanos e cabe ao seu pai achá-lo e salvá-lo. Mas por onde come?ar? O oceano é um "pouquinho" grande…<br>  <br>  Shrek no2<br>   é uma anima??o bem diferente de tudo que você já viu. é ousado pra ser um filme infantil e infantil pra ser um filme ousado (se é que vocês me entendem). Mas o filme, mesmo com essa indefini??o, é ótimo, principalmente por causa do Burro Falante, personagem que foi dublado por Eddie Murphy no original (a dublagem brasileira ficou muito boa também). O Burro tem os melhores diálogos e ao final de cada situa??o tem sempre uma tirada sarcástica pra falar. Acredite, toda vez que ele aparece vem uma gargalhada .<br>  <br>  “A Era do Gelo 2”  no3<br>  tinha a responsabilidade de agradar a uma verdadeira legi?o de f?s do primeiro filme. A boa notícia é que a seqüência, dirigida pelo brasileiro Carlos Saldanha (co-diretor do original e do recente “Rob?s”), n?o só mantém o mesmo pique, como chega a superar o primeiro desenho gra?as ao roteiro bem estruturado, ao carinhoso desenvolvimento das personalidades do trio de protagonistas e à inclus?o de novos e carismáticos personagens.<br>  <br>  Madagascar, no4<br>  Conta a história de um grupo de animais que vivem uma vida cheia de regalias no Zoológico do Central park de Nova York. Tudo vai muito bem, até quando um dos animais desaparece, e os outros fogem do zoológico para encontra-lo.<br>  <br>  Ratatouille no5<br>  A história segue o pequeno roedor Remy, que é completamente diferente dos outros ratos. Só gosta de comida refinada, queijos refinados, iguarias difíceis de serem encontradas por um rato, mas para Remy é fácil, porque ele vive na própria Fran?a e adora correr risco de vida perseguindo as comidas em restaurantes parisienses e aí é que está armada a confus?o.<br>  <br>  N?o posso deixar de falar em BAMBI o filme que considero uma perfei??o, pela estória de amor linda entre m?e e filho e toda jornada de um veadinho para chegar à idade adulta.

8yE2sYGeaa	He is out of control and easily angered, so he cannot channel this great might he owns|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	Because he is The Hulk he suffers from uncontrollable rushes of testosterone, which makes him *very* irritable and cranky.  This occasionally results in fights with people who are normally on his side but who are also, themselves, aggressive.<br>  <br>  Remember, 80% (or more) of comic book content is fighting.  *shrug*  It is just the nature of the beast.|`|v90GoCA6aa	Ummm dose the fraze "Hulk Smash", mean anything to you? Not to be rude, but anyone who can't see why must not be paying to much attention. Hulk is a raging monster neither on the side of good or evil. He'll attack them both. His destructive qualities coupled with his strength and rage mean his rampaging will hurt innocent people, destroy public and privet property, endanger the public as a whole, and a lot of other really bad things.

lTDeZ0Obaa	Everybody wonders, it's only human nature. But, this is the ultimate unanswerable question. Christians who believe in Heaven and Hell BELIEVE they have the answer, but who REALLY knows? People who've died, then been resuscitated and had near death experiences have some pretty incredible stories, but scientists have explanations about the chemicals in the brain and lack of oxygen that can cause these visions, so again...who REALLY knows? There are those who believe in reincarnation. It goes on and on. No one knows. The only thing that can be known for certain is that your heart, lungs, and brain cease to function (along with all other organs) and life stops. What comes after NO ONE can say with any certainty, it is only guessing, hoping, belief, and faith (for those who are religious).|`|XZecjMyXaa	your spirit seperates from your body and would go either to heaven or hell.

(maybe the story can be several months long).<br>  Then you find out later that the original guy was lost in the jungle on vacation, and returns. Or maybe he's finally caught for stealing the clothes.<br>  I don't know, just maybe come up with a BIGGER story.<br>  That's always better, having a bigger story.

I think this woman must have some sort of mental problem to be having so many kids in-vitro (some or all of her previous 6 children were also implanted) without a husband or visible means of financial support. It sounds like even her own mother thinks she is a bit mental. I can't believe the doctors kept consenting to do these procedures. Who is paying for those kids?|`|Ukgl64pSaa	NO|`|eQaApazjaa	no. i think thats stupid. if she was a good mother she wouldnt live in a 2 bedroom house with all those children...instead of having that many children maybe she should work harder to be able to afford her OWN house instead of living in one with her mother. 14 children is insane..i mean if u love children and if u have a GOOD SIZED HOUSE and enough money to support a family that big then its fine..but otherwise the children arent going to be getting that great of a life|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	Heck no! I hate those kind of shows.
teOLv3h1aa	it affects soooo many people. pretty much everyone in the world either has depression or knows of someone that has depression. check the source :)<br>  <br>  just wrote a 15 page paper on depression.|`|AA11570236	Absolutely.Many people from all ages,country's and cultures suffer from it.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	Definitely because if we don't help the people we love with their depression they could end up doing something really stupid. No body likes being sad especially depressed it's always good to give a helping hand.<br>  <br>  ?|`|lwJF5DhHaa	the reason why its important <br>  its because one of the symptoms is thoughts of suicide|`|KzG4C6nJaa	because people are constantly commiting suicide because they are depressed.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Only if you are the one who is depressed.|`|H9gmJYdmaa	I don't think it holds great importance.  A lot of people are depressed and a lot of people pretend to be depressed so they can get sympathy from their piers and points on the 'cool' scale because they overdose on Zoloft and have a bleak outlook on life.  I mean, I'm not saying no one is depressed, it's just that if you are, keep it between you and the shrink, okay?|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	I think it is such an important issue because everyone gets depressed and it is something that everyone can share at least one experience with I'm sorry, I cant really help this is a tough question.|`|19nQDjEmaa	I suffered through depression about 10 years ago and I didn't even feel like moving out of the house to do anything! It is important to try to get people up and moving again so they can live life!|`|sLmX4H3Caa	Depression. What kind of depression...economic or emotional?|`|gcVA74Odaa	It's grossly misdiagnosed so yes.|`|RN0zRPH4aa	because it's very real and very devastating|`|XD2j8BNUaa	some people get so depressed that they consider of committing suicide. |`|EOW8DOoNaa	because its ******* real|`|543ad83a8b619cb5553c86ca187f08dfaa	Depression is important because it does not discriminate due to age, race, or how much money you make. It is important b/c not everyone is diagnosedd. Depression is a risk factor for anyone who has had any major issues in thier life. It is a risk factor for new mothers or someone who just had bypass with coronary relapse. <br>  The treatment of depression is more important b/c if not treated it increases the physical decline of older people.|`|y4JrDSLUaa	Yes. It's an important issue because the number one cause of young people dying (young people meaning under 25) is suicide, which is a product of depression. This means more youths die by their own hand than in car accidents, or any other cause.<br>  <br>  Edit: BigBalls, depression is a mental illness. It doesn't mean the individual is lazy or doesn't want happiness. Depression can affect anyone, it's very real.|`|elXHOwQEaa	It is important for many reasons:<br>  -people lost their houses through mortages<br>  -elderly people will not be able to obtain enough money for retirement, especially because it will take almost 10 years for the depression to recover<br>  -for younger people that still work, it is not such a big deal because they can still make money and their investments will come back up before they retire|`|p7qlWejzaa	There are much bigger issues in life than to worry about all of those losers who are depressed. We should send them to Russia where they would have a reason to be depressed and allow only positive and ambitious people reside in our country. Personally I put the entire blame of the state of our economy, our wars, and racism on the depressed losers. If they were ambitious and positive none of those negative things would happen. We should have a joint effort to:<br>  <br>  Wipe out AIDS<br>  Wipe out Poverty<br>  Wipe out Cancer<br>  and <br>  Wipe out depressed losers|`|CKmXgTUqaa	Because loads of other issues come off it, like how you resolve your depression. Some people can easily get over it but others find it difficult and can go from anorexia to committing suicide. Its an extremely important issue because in come cases it leads to death!|`|4wjOo0mEaa	Depression is an important issue because, It can lead to serious stuff like suicide, eating disorders, loss of interests in things they love. people who have depression should talk to someone, and get help. yes, depression is a very important issue.|`|geMVggIOaa	yes. it is important because that is the first stage of suicide. they get depressed and dont want to do anything. then they go into the emo stage which is simillar to the suicidal stage but not quite there yet. then finally SUICIDE. some people can over come depression but many cant.|`|wrKJTMOYaa	So you asked.<br>  <br>  Now what is it you really want to know?  An important issue from what standpoint, nationally, locally, the world?  What are we talking about?|`|yifqm8Jfaa	It's important because sometimes if people get too depressed they will commit suicide. Most of the time when people are depressed they bring down others around them also. It ends up affecting everyone and not just that one person.|`|oIPEOFh3aa	it's definitely an important issue because it can lead to worse conditions like schizophrenia, and even suicide|`|r3JrDsB1aa	your in polls & surveys, I don't know if you mean the economy or psychological.|`|cc43fc160c3155ccbc73669c112ac994aa	Depression is a bummer.|`|o74hFR0Faa	It is important because it may lead to suicide|`|AA10627625	It can lead to suicide and life is valuable.|`|NogbbqaLaa	yes so many people suffer from it including me |`|oQRGx8cTaa	yes it is and it's sad so many suffer from it and society treats us the way it does|`|GyAHdUaEaa	cuz some people resort to suicide which is an an very obvious important issue |`|xLBpvV0jaa	Some people may think it is maybe they just feel like it.|`|aXl47h5Faa	People lose jobs.|`|dgZAqHtxaa	its sad people die from that plus i dont like sad people there gloomy|`|ZP9RuxFJaa	because thers so much bad stuff in the world

578dbe2353b19bc69963b9570c3e5043aa	No.<br>  Moore has made a name for himself with his very anti-Bush documentaries.  And since he is still in office, Bush would have little reason to go do a film with him when he knows all Moore will do is ask questions on topics and insult Bush's intelligence at every turn.<br>  Now in 4-5 years, maybe.|`|AA11362931	Because Michael Moore is not a actual journalist or even a notable one.  By his own word, his documentaries are biased to his skewed view of the world.|`|oR2KWGnaaa	Dick Cheney giving an interview in Vanity Fair is bad enough, but George Bush giving an interview to Michael Moore would be pushing it.  Moore represents the left and, unlike Vanity Fair, his methods for representing his agenda aren't very acceptable to the right.  Moore is a very good filmmaker (I loved his breakthrough film Roger & Me, Bowling for Columbine, and the recent Sicko).  His films are thought provoking and entertaining but he is not a journalist or documentarian.  His films are too biased to be either, and I can see why the President would not want to be associated with them (although his adminstration went too far, per usual, when they debated wether or not charges should be sought against Moore for trying to bring 911 rescue workers to Guantanamo Bay for treatment.  The whole idea that these rescue workers can't get free care for 911 related health issues while the terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay get the best health care was worthy of the stunt Moore pulled).|`|4Mu9M1xUaa	if i were bush i would steer clear of him too. then id kill myself.

b96ac734d4f0486d4914d2b2a2277c31aa	I can't answer all your questions about DJ but I can tell you a few things about him..<br>  <br>  I met DJ in 1999 through my sister who met him at the shop where we all got our tattoos (Body and Soul on Ventura blvd - same place Britanny Spears hacked her hair off recently)...DJ was getting his sleeve done (confederate flag)...He reminded my sister of my ex at the time and she really wanted me to meet him (he is very very HOT)... We only hung out a few times as I moved out of state and I've run into him recently since I've been back in L.A. - so its' not like we're best friends or anything, but we are friends and it's always a pleasure to see him.... He is one of the nicest, down to earth, sexy men you'd ever meet in this town full of wannabes and fakes.  His success with Nikki is well deserved and finally the world can meet DJ on a larger scale (he was already well known for his previous work) and find out what a cool person he is!<br>  He's a pretty open guy and you can probably find out as much as you need to know about him on his website, or his myspace page... he puts alot of info out there....<br>  <br>  To sum it up... DJ Ashba is one hell of a classy rock star inside and out...and I'm seriously proud to know him.....
e51f56c8dba4861e728c9aff4a10877aaa	Ken Mellons<br>  <br>  "Paint Me a Birmingham" is a song recorded and relased by American country music artist Tracy Lawrence. It is the first single released from his album, Strong. In late May 2004, this song reached a peak of #4 on the United States of America (U.S.) Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, marking Lawrence's first Top 5 hit since "Lessons Learned" in 2000.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Content<br>  The narrator describes an encounter on the beach with an artist who is painting ocean scenes. The singer then asks the painter to paint a picture of the plans that the man and his lost lover had made: "Paint me a Birmingham / Make it look just the way I planned / A little house on the edge of town / Porch goin' all the way around / Put her there in the front yard swing / Cotton dress, make it early spring / For awhile she'll be mine again / If you can paint me a Birmingham."<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Other versions<br>  Ken Mellons recorded a version of the song on his 2004 album Sweet. Mellons' version peaked at #54 in early 2004, while Lawrence's version was also climbing the charts.

enZFuONLaa	Baseball.  I grew up in a small town that had a long tradition of good high school teams so it was just part of life.  I loved playing and now I love watching it.|`|vtiea9eTaa	What do you have against football? If you don't like it, don't watch it.......Trust me, with 70% of baseball players using illegal subsatnces mainly steroids, those baseball players will be in bad shape once they reach 50, if they live that long.......
4e273dbae25c11d86ad7ea492bf8281daa	If you put American football in perspective, most of it involves almost violent collisions.  A human body can only take so much of that before it breaks down and can't take the punishment any more.

zwJdduTNaa	Lucy wanted to kill Nana(#7) because she is annoying and listens to humans like lucy she hates people only her own species and looks down on them so lucy kills her because they got in a fight for trying to make papa(her so called father happy)<br>  and in the end Nana gets tempted and loses and gets her limbs torn off.|`|iQAyt7Uzaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  I think Lucy's just releasing her pent up anger..|`|kDUhkX8paa	The Only Reason Lucy wants to kill her is that She kills people (and diclionious[sp?]) is that its in her nature. It should be #7's aswell but her "father" told her to be a good girl and not to Kill anyone (but Lucy)|`|mMdLhNa7aa	That's easy. No. 7 (Nana) has the order to bring Lucy 'home' but Lucy of course, resisted and would kill anyone who tries to take her in. It's not like she wants to kill Nana but Nana wants to kill her/take her forcefully so Lucy has to protect herself, right?

lnCNUdf9aa	I think most of us answer the questions honestly. I think p&s is a place we come to  for a few reasons. One its to pass the time, another reason is is a place where we can be ouselves, and not be judged...( well maybe by the trolls but who cares about them) and I think alot of us have grown to have a friendship with our contacts. I have found that this is a place where we can have a few laughs, and our contacts are here for us to we need seriuos advice. Dont get me wrong, I have family and friends that mean the world to me, but p&s  is like another world kinda. Not really fantasy, ...hard to explain.

Z2nLhbp7aa	A store that sells husbands has just opened where a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men. The store is composed of 6 floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights. <br>  <br>  There is, however, a catch. As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building. <br>  <br>  So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. <br>  <br>  On the first floor the sign on the door reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 1 - These men have jobs. <br>  <br>  The woman reads the sign and says to herself, "Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?" So up she goes. <br>  <br>  The second floor sign reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids. <br>  <br>  The woman remarks to herself, "That's great, but I wonder what's further up?" And up she goes again. <br>  <br>  The third floor sign reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 3 - These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking. <br>  <br>  "Hmmm, better" she says. "But I wonder what's upstairs?" <br>  <br>  The fourth floor sign reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework. <br>  <br>  "Wow!" exclaims the woman, "very tempting. BUT, there must be more further up!" And again she heads up another flight. <br>  <br>  The fifth floor sign reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak. <br>  <br>  "Oh, mercy me! But just think... what must be awaiting me further on?" So up to the sixth floor she goes. <br>  <br>  The sixth floor sign reads: <br>  <br>  Floor 6 - You are visitor 6,875,953,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.|`|Hc9DRDhxaa	''My God!

While her husband is off at work, she decides that she is going to paint a couple of rooms in the house. <br>  <br>  The next day, right after her husband leaves for work, she gets down to the task at hand. <br>  <br>  Her husband arrives home at 5:30 and smells the distinctive smell of paint. He walks into the living room and finds his wife lying on the floor in a pool of sweat. He notices that she is wearing a ski jacket and a fur coat at the same time. <br>  <br>  He goes over and asks her if she is OK. She replies yes. <br>  <br>  He asks what she is doing. <br>  <br>  She replies that she wanted to prove to him that not all blonde women are dumb and she wanted to do it by painting the house. <br>  <br>  He then asks her why she has a ski jacket over her fur coat. <br>  <br>  She replies that she was reading the directions on the paint can and they said.... <br>  <br>  FOR BEST RESULTS, PUT ON TWO COATS.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blonde Diet<br>  <br>  A blonde woman is terribly overweight, so her doctor puts her on a diet. "I want you to eat regularly for two days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure for two weeks. The next time I see you, you’ll have lost at least five pounds." <br>  <br>  When the blonde returned, she shocked the doctor by losing nearly 20 pounds. <br>  <br>  "Why, that’s amazing!" the doctor said. "Did you follow my instructions?" <br>  <br>  The blonde nodded. "I’ll tell you though, I thought I was going to drop dead that third day." <br>  <br>  "From hunger, you mean?" asked the doctor. <br>  <br>  "No, from skipping." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Because I'm Blonde?<br>  <br>  A girl came skipping home FROM school one day.

"Mommy, Mommy," she yelled, "we were in gym class today, and when we showered, all the other girls had flat chests, but I have these!" And she lifted her tank top to reveal a pair of 36Cs. <br>  <br>  "Very good," said her embarrassed mother. <br>  <br>  "Is it because I'm blonde, mommy?" <br>  <br>  "No, Honey, it's because you're 25."|`|yGKzKAX8aa	hear about the two peanuts walking down the street?    one was assaulted!                         ha ha ha ha

Leda2ha0aa	They had a challenge in the pitch dark, delicious fattening treats all over the tables.  Whoever took in the most calories got to pick the teams and trainers.  Heba announced she was going to eat to keep the teams the way they were and she wanted to keep Bob as her trainer.  She ate a donut and Phil ending up eating a Peanut Butter cup.  He was trying to be discreet about it so no one knew he was doing it (he didn't want Heba to be the control freak and pick teams), but nasty Heba heard him taking off the wrapper so she went for another donut.  Amy C. ended up eating one brownie but only at the last minute.  Everyone else sat there and did nothing. After Heba figured out Phil was also eating she decided to be nasty and put him on the other team and split him and his wife up.  Shellay (the older mom) was voted off because she didn't make the numbers and didn't need to lose as much weight as everyone else.

Same with Demi Lovato.|`|7L0PFTXKaa	No.|`|pzY0ARqDaa	Well that is a much better choice, overall.<br>  Miley Cyrus is not a good role model for young children, and Selena Gomez is a much better role model, and a prettier girl, she also doesn't have horrible exposed pictures of herself leaking all over the world wide web. <br>  I am also bummed to say, that this is most likely not going to happen. First off, Miley Cyrus's father Billy Ray Cyrus is on the show. He writes the songs for his daughter, this is how she became famous, with her disney channel show "Hannah Montana". If she gets tooken off the show, the show will not continue. Do you actually think that Miley Cyrus's father will allow this to happen. He won't make songs for Selena Gomez. Then no more Hannah Montana, and there will be tons of disappointed children. There also would not be a Wizards Of Waverly Place.|`|HPnVRcgEaa	Nope,<br>  but Selena is getting bigger now.<br>  They are pretty much turning selena into a miley.<br>  <br>  example:  <br>  giving her a tv show, starting her up on music.<br>  and the media is helping out.<br>  <br>  Lets just hope selena can handle fame better tehn miley and Selna keeps her clothing on herself and her tougne in her own mouth ( at least in pictures)|`|5M2WT5oDaa	Please do.<br>  :)<br>  I like Miley, but at the same time she is SO ANNOYING.<br>  Selena is bettttter.

Hu1g2qyVaa	With the excessive amount of scandalous pics of Miley emerging within the last year, I would have to say that she is not a good influence. Hannah Montana is a good influence. Miley is not Hannah. In an effort to prove that she is a totally different person, I think Miley is distancing herself from the goody-goody show. I don't think she wants to be a good influence on kids. She wants to appeal to older teens and younger adults. She doesn't want to be sweet ol' Hannah forever. It's pretty funny actually. People were having this same conversation about 6 or 7 years ago when sweet little 17-year-old Britney Spears had a scandalous photo in Rolling Stone. History always seems to repeat itself!|`|c0bcd9a294c0443400b3ffc5a2034a6aaa	Ummm no she is not.   But then again she was never geared toward the 6 and under crowd. I have a six year old that fell in love with her when she was four. And fell right out of love when she saw allll the pics! My daughter said she is not making good choices. I'm fine with that,lol!  Influence should always start at home!!|`|uLOWWcoWaa	Not at all. sorry with all those pictures if i had a kid i wouldn't want her to look up to Miley.|`|Ujdt4bmFaa	oh my god<br>  leave the girl alone<br>  i personally like her|`|2tBYpqTxaa	The fact that parents are concerned about Miley Cyrus as a good influence shows that their kids spend more time in front of junk TV, than in front of something else more beneficial. I think it is quite sad. Every parent can't spend as much time with their children as they would like to but those that do have the time and don't should not spend it in front of the television. It doesn't cost money to go outside and push a swing and it is very inexpensive to read something exciting to them. Unplug.|`|SQesrfo3aa	yeah because teens tend to influence children more than adult or older artists. This is because of the similarity between them. She is also like a role model to the children espeacially the girls. They would love to be successful and famous like her when they grow up. I think Miley Cyrus is someone great..a teen who is balancing her life well. She helps others too. Cant say she is perfect too cause everyone's not perfect.|`|dQQvhCdfaa	Absolutely NOT! Children should be able to grow up at their own pace, and don't need to be looking up to another child who has grown up to quickly.  <br>  <br>  I don't have any kids, but when I do, especially if they are girls, they will NOT be watching the "wholesome" and "family oriented" shows of the Disney channel.  Shame on Disney, Shame on Miley's parents.|`|FlEC0VA9aa	i do... everything she's done on the disney channel has really influenced kids... i have 3 younger sisters and they're all OBSESSED with her.

AA11022638	I have never seen it.|`|d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	Yes it does.<br>  <br>   I consider it to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.<br>  <br>  - Regarding part 1: Jesus<br>  <br>  The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory. <br>  It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?<br>  <br>  Some other views:<br>  <br>  " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...</a><br>  <br>  For a point-by-point analysis, see <a href="http://www.conspiracyscience.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/" rel="nofollow">http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  For more rebuttals, see <a href="http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-story-of-jesus" rel="nofollow">http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  - Regarding Part II: 9/11<br>  <br>  It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view. <br>  <br>  The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement. (I've heard some speculate this may have been a red-herring to discredit the 'truth' movement).<br>  <br>  For a point by point analysis, see <a href="http://www.conspiracyscience.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-two/" rel="nofollow">http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...</a> <br>   <br>  <br>  - Regarding Part III: Men behind the curtain<br>  <br>  As a liberatarian, I found this part to have had the most potential in exposing abuses of government and men in power. Instead, it trots out tired long disproven conspiracy theories. <br>  <br>  "Income Tax law Doesn't exist" theory - Very stale. Consistently disproven over-and-over again. No new information, just new victims going to jail that fall for these arguments. Very sad. <br>  <br>  "Federal Reserve System is owned by international bankers" - Still a common conspiracy theory. Still wrong. The Federal Reserve System, is headed by the Board of Governors, a Government Agency (look it up - <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> ). The Federal Reserve branches can definitely be considered tightly regulated corporations owned by their member banks, all of which must be American-owned by law. It is receives regular audits, and is overseen by congress. <br>  <br>  For a point-by-point analysis, check out:<br>  <a href="http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-federal-reserve" rel="nofollow">http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...</a><br>  <a href="http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-income-tax" rel="nofollow">http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...</a><br>  <a href="http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-war" rel="nofollow">http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...</a><br>  <br>  Other views:<br>  <br>  "There is no shortage of information which refutes this viewpoint. But this type of conspiracy relies on two elements common to web surfers: First, they're only willing to check facts at the most superficial level, which usually means they'll read a message or watch a clip just once before forming an opinion and moving on.

There is a certain irony here since the films overarching thesis is to be wary of those who would obfuscate the truth in an attempt to persuade others to their point of view. Even more bizarre are allegations that detractors of the film must be agents of some sort and part of the grand conspiracy.|`|44DQLDkQaa	It's true about the income tax stuff.

It is somewhat of an opinion and if you watch it taking it to the heart instead of in an objective way then..sure you will get pissed. Watch it with an open mind and don't let it effect your faith.

IJTcGIG7aa	It might help, depending on what's causing the problem, but there are better things to take in almost every situtation.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Probably not.  The bubbles, in fact, might make it feel worse.  Your best bet is to get regular Coke, let it get warm, pour some in a glass and pour it back and forth into another glass till some of the bubbles go away.  It is the Coke syrup that helps.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Ginger ale or ginger tea are the best.  Ginger is a natural aid to nausea.  If you can eat ginger snaps are great for nausea.|`|7l0XmyZwaa	a hug and a kiss always makes anything upset feel better|`|71vWjc8Qaa	It's ginger ale that helps an upset stomach.|`|frwlypDWaa	Molson's is better, but Sprite will do in a pinch.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	Coke does it for me - it's the carbonation. And soda crackers, too.|`|AA10838250	7-up|`|QPwrLdUxaa	no, i'd say the fizziness would make u feel worse :P|`|Ff1zFcRBaa	it should|`|Li6HA6Efaa	yeah if you drink too much of it|`|RyE6kUnTaa	give it a go|`|qWNdhGVXaa	yes|`|59iSPST0aa	either ginger ale, or coke.|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	Yes.  It's the carbonation that does the trick.  Adults give it to children because it doesn't have any caffiene in it and it's sweet so they will actually drink it as opposed to club soda.|`|K0bCh6iQaa	Yes.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	Sprite helps mine. Coke works for me too. But they say ginger ale is the best for a stomach ache.|`|EsufC1qhaa	yeah right. stop this crap talk. of course it doesn't help an upset stomach... whatr u sayin??  its sugar levels and the gas it contains does you nothing but pure HARM. who said it benefits ?|`|szqMXvlSaa	it helps mine but i drink it room temp.. it helps with gas .. but you can down or drink to much.. hope this helps|`|q8MVZtmEaa	No, coca cola helps.|`|MQgbuNcYaa	I haven't heard of that, but I have heard that drinking flat coke does.|`|AIKKRgGJaa	I thought you were supposed to drink ginger ale?|`|AA11728288	Ginger beer|`|fbLhW9zQaa	yes. 7 up also works.|`|APxCwPQvaa	Only if you add vodka|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	no ginger ale does the stomach good|`|1VhNIjvtaa	For some people.  For me its a flat seven up|`|0VmWIcHAaa	It doesn't help my tummy when it is upset|`|FpcxoXoFaa	no, ginger ale|`|Zbrg4q7baa	yep but you're meant to make it flat first.|`|3aa0b1b9f68903def0ac0d592307eff7aa	IT doesn't help your stomach, it helps put fluids into your body without further upsetting your stomach.  It's a clear fluid that is easy for the body to digest so that chances of it making your stomach feel worse are pretty low.  Nothing really helps an upset stomach other than time for your digestive system to deal with it.|`|ITxfWaF2aa	This kind of depends on your stomach, it helps most but not all. For me when I was seven I had a terrible upset stomach and I drank some flat sprite and with in ten minutes it was back to normal! It really worked well for me! Some say ginger ale works too, which I believe but have never tried. The only thing is that the sprite HAS to be flat, or it usually wont work. Good luck if you are going to try it! :) Hope I answered your question.|`|XicSJvX6aa	ginger ale is the best.<br>  ginger is the key to settle a tummy.<br>  i would actually shake it up to make it lose the carbonation and then drink it room temperature, and take little bites of a ginger snap cookie.<br>  Also a cold compress on the back of your neck will subside the tummy quizzes also, along with elevating the legs|`|sviPMA6uaa	Usually, Sprite gives me an upset stomach, whenever I have Fountain sprite from a restruant or pizzeria, and I eat Cheese sticks or something with cheese the mixture upset my stomach alot, so  I do honestly beleive it`s Ginger Ale that is the Magical Ale.|`|xs43Xbdlaa	Ginger ale<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=441918513" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|MX831qtraa	Whenever I have a stomach ache, my parents always tell me to drink sprite or coke. The fizz and bubbles make you burp,<br>  So sometimes it will make you feel a little better.|`|oQt8KxMmaa	It's supposed to, because of the bubbles. But ginger ale is more effective - because ginger helps settle the stomach.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|fYAZcBbVaa	The bubbly carbonation is supposed to ease pain in some stomacheaches but this doesn't work with everyone, especially if they drink sprite a lot as it is.|`|HfA298Jvaa	For me 7up and Sprite really help me out when I have an upset stomach or gas in conjunction with Saltine crackers. Besides taking Pepto Bismo, also sucking on a mint of any kind helps for some reason too.|`|XHy1nctFaa	It isn't just sprite, its any sort of carbonated drink. A little beer settles my stomach the best, unless its upset because of beer haha. Mint works wonders too.|`|wrK1tgsbaa	Well, not really, more ginger ale and some crackers or toast to go along will make your stomach feel better! You may also want to try chicken noodle soup.|`|Nc637a6laa	it does mine, the carbonation helps but I only drink small sips, cuz I don't like soda's, but I use tums or rolaids for a upset tummy first.|`|rsE1m7aOaa	nope, the carbonation might help some people a little, you're better off drinking ginger ale though|`|7HHo3xR8aa	no bt when you drink a flavored drink and ur throwing up this might be nasty bt it flavors the puke so it dosnt tast as bad|`|aZ9z2gEqaa	Depends on what kind of stomach problems. It normally does, but sometimes it won't. The best way to know is to try!|`|UG5YZj59aa	the best thing in my experience for an upset stomach is a peppermint|`|KZ5aib1zaa	You mean ginberale righht, then yess, i eat toast drink tea rhen i drink ginger rale and eat saltines|`|6EARGhYFaa	I think any fizzy drink would do it in those instances.|`|KFLqTFo3aa	I think it is actually ginger ale. It works best if it's flat (no fizz) and sipped out of a straw.|`|kx46DTpxaa	Yes.. as long as the Sprite or Lemonade is flat then it would help|`|6e76c7ae80a5a7fc603bb68da472bf5eaa	gingerale|`|fV47ExCRaa	yes it does.|`|P6fT0LBiaa	gingel ale or powerade|`|iiAyfpcsaa	same as baking soda and water. u got to pass gas|`|sb6xHlAmaa	I thought it was coke... Drunk very slowly, though. Tiny sips.|`|dF3vVTwFaa	Thats what my grandma used to always give me and it seemed to work.|`|fS9K5xnBaa	7up does|`|rwG4JPXQaa	no,drink pepto bismal|`|v6KxUhjwaa	only if your obese|`|WMc3UIXsaa	ginger ale helps.<br>  i dont think sprite does.|`|95onvg4Waa	i think so<br>  but ginger ale is better|`|mC9VhWEeaa	It helps mine, I don't quite know why though.|`|00azMDstaa	it helps a little<br>  but ginger ale helps more|`|Zt788N2baa	A lot of people say that but I don't think it's a proven fact.|`|JKAyJ0PLaa	ginger ale helps more

foqCXKR3aa	No|`|bXL9937haa	Question 1: Are you old enough to be a father?  Question 2: Why would you put someone in that position?  Question 3: Do you look at everything you read so literally?    Now, my advice is no! You are too young to be thinking about that. Just hang out, enjoy life. Sex is a lot of responsibility. You don't want to get your self in a predicament. Plus, to push that onto any girl would be wrong. I'm not saying that there won't be girls pushing themselves onto you. However, all it takes is one time. Possibly, then someone is going to be calling you daddy. And only being 14 and not taking care of yourself, fully. My response is NO!|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	You are both too young to be having sex.  You may think you are ready for it, but it is a big responsibility, AND if you are not careful, you could get in big trouble - in more ways than one.    Forget the horoscope thing - that's just a bunch of garbage that appeals to people who don't know anything about Astrology.     Give yourself at least another year of getting to know each other; and if you are both ready for sex, talk about it first........so you are both  prepared phsycially and emotionally.|`|CIGckTSPaa	horiscopes r not true  and stupid|`|3WItFAwlaa	Don't be stupid.  A girl that you have barely kissed is not going to have sex with you because of something you choose to read into your horoscope.  I do think the "elements of fantasy" part applies because you are definitely dreaming.  A girl has bigger plans for her first time.  They do NOT include a 30 minutes hike to your dad's house.  I guess you missed the part in her horoscope about a swanky hotel.  lol  Relationships happen in a certain order.  You are attempting to skip several important steps not to mention a couple of bases.  You aren't even old enough to drive.  I doubt you know how to put on a condom.  Do you know how to change a diaper???   How are YOU going to teach her anything?  You don't know anything yourself.     Sorry cowboy.  Put your pistol back in your holster.  You are not getting laid this weekend.  Worry about getting your driver's license first.|`|QhlEOI6iaa	I think it means that you should take her to the mall and buy her ice-cream and some starbucks. Then walk her home and maybe she'll give you a kiss on the cheek.     A cold shower might be helpful before going on a date. If you want a girl to like you, be a gentleman and think with your brain, not your privates.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	You;d be better off flipping a coin
AA10954273	This is answered in the season 1 episode "Three Stories".  While golfing, House suffered an infarction in his leg.  When he went to the ER the doctor thought he was a junkie looking to score pain killers, so he was dismissed.  He diagnosed himself a few days later, but by that point the muscle tissue had died.  The hospital wanted to amputate his leg but he refused.   He was put into a coma due to the pain, and his fiancee, Stacy, gave them permission to remove the dead muscle.  This left him with a permanent limp and in constant pain.|`|FFQXBaLPaa	"What happened to House's leg?   EditHistoryDelete He had an infarction in his right thigh.    Similar to a clot that causes a stroke if it is in the brain, a heart attack if it is in the heart and an embolism if it is in the lung, an infarction in his leg blocked the flow of blood. House explains this in the "Pilot."    ***SPOILERS***  It is further explained in "Three Stories" that his condition went misdiagnosed for three days causing severe nerve damage and muscle death. They wanted to amputate his leg but he opposed it. The surgery that tried to restore blood circulation and removal of dead muscle tissue left his leg permanently impaired and in chronic pain."|`|2kpr2arRaa	he had an Infarction in my leg- resulting in Muscle Death in that leg-- it was explained in season 1  ep  21- Three Stories    (the shooting came much later)      http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/s1_e21.h...|`|aucsqB7Laa	Well, he already had a limp before I started to watch the show, but he also got shot in the leg by the husband of a former patient. That's all I kn ow.  O.K. I knew it was something else.  just trying..... jeez.....

Hope i helped!|`|k39bNUgeaa	Chester Bennington    Born: 20-Mar-1976  Birthplace: Phoenix, AZ|`|cSaRk1Ygaa	Chester Charles Bennington (born March 20, 1976 in Phoenix, Arizona.) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.

BeFneHRgaa	Yeah I know, Jack and the baby going was really harsh.    But I think they're tryna eliminate that storyline so the writers can give her a new love interest.    If she had a baby and a husband she wouldn't have been able to have kept the story going higher. She's the hottest one!    I think her life will pick up.    Sucks though.|`|0a3e8afcef784f7c3fadf1171e01b3e0aa	Yes she does but look back over the years, she certainly enjoyed herself with many a boyfriend etc in the past.  I reckon poor Belle has a rough time of it too. She seems to end up in hospital an awful lot.|`|esKhGbnHaa	yeah i do!...  first the cancer  then losing her daughter  then jack dying|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	yes.|`|1uvnbVOXaa	Its the role she has to play- unlucky in life.|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Yeah, but I also find her kind of annoying.

8Xllb2MJaa	I don't like judging rappers too much before they've released a full length album, but I like him. He's not taking hip-hop too seriously and at least he's keeping hip-hop music relevant and fun.    I'm not sure if he'll make an impact, we'll just have to wait and see, he has potential.|`|hyY5t2JKaa	guys a joke and needs to stop trying to come off like the other Hamilton who is actually talented... kinda BS to have artists with similar names espcially when ones a deush bag rapper and the other is a dope *** singer who made the song "Coming where im from" that song along is better then anything Charles Hamilton will ever release!... yea I said it!!!|`|xWUJeGfraa	No!!!! At first i liked him..he has that real pure hip hop sound no gimmicks and he didnt talk about the regular things in hip hop...cars,ice,women etc...But i really listened to him and his flow is wack and boring...his delivery is very weak..he may drop a decent line from time to time but most of his lyrics dont make any kind of impact on you..the problem is his flow though..he should take some tips from Ludacris.He's a decent producer though "Most Likely tyo Succed" is his best song..i think he made that beat..im not "hating" i just kind of like doing rapper scouting reports..lol...    EDIT: Ludacris might have the best delivery and flow of all time..thats why he needs to take tips from him|`|1qUokeKOaa	charles hamilton is raw than a mathafucka i hope he makes an album i just hope he dosen't head down the path that lil wayne took once a good rapper now a shitter rapper|`|bpzI7SQkaa	yeah this kid is pretty good    and there is nothing like brooklyn girls|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	He ain't that great but he's gonna sell|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Personally I'm not into him, but I listened to him and he's better than most these rappers on the radio so props to him if he makes it.

Vancouver, Canada would be a great place to live because it is conveniently located, it's the fifth cleanest city in the world, and it's crime rate is low.  However: If you need a job and you like living near people, New York City would be the best place for you.  If you like the country, then somewhere good to live for you would probably be in the mid-western United States of America.  It all depends on what you like and what your life needs are, and if you have a family or not.|`|4E2FYEHsaa	Gotham City!|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, I love South Louisiana but if there is a hurricane coming here, get out as fast as you can and head north!|`|OxaonF5aaa	keep moving!|`|HJfjG9fRaa	At Katherine Zeta Jones please.    .|`|vlVdn5GFaa	somewhere fun, not where i live.

It sucks, but we (or people in the USA) have to deal with it. All economists agree that the governmnent has to spend money at one point to help the economy.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	Better to the lazy than more to themselves.|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	They already do, its called welfare and food stamps...|`|b5eSmOhiaa	It depends on what you mean by lazy.  I assume you mean the lower class.  People haul bricks to make less money then someone sitting in a computer chair typing away for 6 hours, fixing a server or something like that.  Does that mean they're lazy?  No.  It just means they have a lesser education then the one who sits in a computer chair all day.  And the lesser education doesn't mean they're lazy.  They could have quit school to support their family, or their family didn't have enough money to send them off to college without a scholarship.  The person hauling bricks could be supporting a family, and working towards paying for a degree in college to pay more for their family.  Sorry if I seem like I'm bagging on you, but it's just the truth.|`|0lV2C78xaa	I don't think so no, not the lazy.      I do think that government programs have helped out the NEEDY very much so.

If you tried to sell me a mixtape, I'd laugh at you.    So my advice would be to sell to people with no internet access.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Ok. The worse that could happen is that you'd get caught for bootlegging and have to pay a fine.|`|XiyrpRvnaa	one day suspension and a warning    just don't get caught and you're all good    I used to sell food at school until I got caught, but I made ~$500 doing it!

I guess I overall I would like Fall Out boy better just because they come out with more releases that are pretty good

It is just utter bullsh!t and anyone who buys into it is a complete moron who deserves to be stupid...and fat!   Bruce Springsteen didn't lip synch....I don't think he would even entertain thaT notion but then again...HE is an actual musician unlike Hudson and Hill who are just puppets!    *edit...To the girl above me Mimi. Everything you said in your answer is exaclt what I am talking about.

All these new stadiums there building have HD acoustic equipment.These newer and better expensive football stadiums are more high tech than what the old ones were that were built in the 50'-90's.Bey once lip-synched the National anthem in Houston Texas.Why because our new stadium Reliant Energy has newer devices and it keeps from the stars making mistakes and etc.     When Whitney Houston did it that was the 90's and the stadiums were old and had  no high Definition music equipment.  Everything is  HI-DEF now and everything is more realistic or viewed too deceive the eye as REAL.

I don't see what the problem is...people still know it's your voice and that's all that really matters.    You also have to realize that many singers (when they perform live) have background dancers and dance themselves. When you're talking about doing song after song, movements and singing becomes tiresome. It's even harder because half of singing itself is breathing properly, and how can you do that when you're running from one side of the stage to the other doing complicated dance moves. True, not all musicians do this, but the point is, it's what has to happen for the show, to be considered a SHOW, ya know what I mean?    But, anyways, many a "professional" singer lip-sync...so I don't see how it makes much of a difference if it's really them who has been recorded. Either way, the earth will still turn.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	they lip synched? that's stupid!! i mean come one perform live!! jeez what's up with ppl lip synching these days. is your voice that bad? i just don't get it|`|I6CIURO3aa	dont really care

KNrXApD5aa	You were born on a new moon!  I can relate to this combination.  I have four planets in Aquarius including my sun, and my moon is in pisces.  Very smart and sensitive.  You see connections and patterns in things that others don't.  You seem other worldly almost.  Harnessing the ability to focus is very important lesson that needs to be learned.  Your intuition is VERY strong and along with seeing what lies beneath, you also feel it.  This combo make you very creative.    11-11 Aquarius/Aquarius   The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a nature that is strong--a little bit indefinite, but strong. This is a combination that is somewhat of another world-ethereal, philosophical, and extremely open-minded. Your individuality and personality is a blend of the Aquarius traits of refinement, intelligence, and a broadly humane nature. Refined and intelligent, this combination provides the possibility of high talent or a streak of genius to be constructively developed. Ideas are prolific, and likely range from the conventional to the eccentric and the unusual. This is a position that is hyperactive mentally, but perhaps a procrastinator. Mentally, you are a trail-blazer, but one who definitely has a very short attention span for you apt to get yourself involved with a wide variety of subjects and avocations. Aquarius has very humanistic instincts, a natural friendliness, and a talent for understanding and reading character. It is easy for you to blend with with strangers, and dealings with people rarely cause you any problem. Just the same, you are independent or somewhat individualistic, and require considerable personal freedom of thought and action. You are apt to success rather easily in business because of a combination of traits you possess. You are people oriented and thus, able to understand the needs of the public. You are original and progressive in your thinking; new ideas and advanced techniques are your forte. Aquarius is a so called fixed sign, so there is a strong fixed element associated with your personality, a high degree of focus and determination in your nature, giving the tenacity to see any of the many tasks that you undertake, through to completion. Whether you are in business or scientific pursuits, you are motivated by very deep interest in doing something positive for world; for improving people's lives in some way. It's important that you stay busy with the expression of your ideas and talents. You are best when unsupervised and independent in your work; at your worst when required to perform any sort of routine or overly systematized task. You're a bit on the high-strung side, and need to be sure of getting adequate relaxation and outside activities that allows the release of tensions. With your ability for controlled rational thinking, clear perception, and humanitarian concern, you surely have a lot to offer the world at large.     Pisces Rising gives a flexible personality, with which you can easily hide your own traits and take on the characteristics of others. Despite your pleasant disposition and willingness to adapt to changing circumstance and the demands of other people, you can be surprisingly strong and determined. The strength of your character, however, is also determined by other important factors in your background.     You have a highly emotional nature, with a quiet, shy personality. Compassionate feelings can be overwhelming, and you must watch the tendency to become a victim of your own vulnerability. Almost before you realize it, or in some cases because you actually seek it, you become your own worst enemy. You are not above using subterfuge and game-playing rather than direct confrontation to get what you want. If however, you develop self-confidence, these less-than-honest emotional ploys are not apt to surface in your personality or behaviour patterns.     New Age Pisces is ruled by Neptune, lord of illusion and imagination, so you have little understanding of how you appear to others. The influence of Neptune can also add an element of glamour or mystery to your appearance. You can for example, either photograph extremely well or your likeness on film may be extremely poor. In either case, photographs fail to capture your true appearance.     Pisces is traditionally ruled by Jupiter, lord of inspiration and drama. Neptune and Jupiter blend together to create a highly imaginative personality and one which views life the way you want it to be, rather than the way it really is. Prone to feelings of abandonment, you often feel sorry for yourself and are easily disillusioned.     Your extreme sensitivity generates artistic or poetic talent as well as psychic abilities. Pisces endows a spiritual or philosophical bent, and great appreciation for education, even should your own have been limited. You love travelling, dancing, and sports and although it is by no means universal with Pisces Rising, you may be less-than-average in physical stature with a|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	11-11 Aquarius/Aquarius  The combination of your Sun sign and your Moon sign produces a nature that is strong--a little bit indefinite, but strong.

You are an intuitive and potentially may be a born psychic. The ultimate in a deep thinker, you see science in art and conversely art in science. You are quite social and enjoy groups or gatherings. Your personal consideration, compassion and humanitarianism makes you popular with many divergent groups and types.                You tend to lean on your mind power and intuition for success in life. You really need to learn a tough mental discipline and to be very discriminatory of your thoughts which run the gamut from the very brilliant to the rather weird. How well you get trained in logic will determine financial successes in your life and whether you are reaching for facts or fiction.                You have many idealistic goals, abundant energy's, and can be a dynamic orator in behalf of your beliefs. You have a healthy respect for an accurately informed public. You can be intense, nervous and temperamental, sometimes even having tantrums. You health could be effected when you become frustrated, so chill out.                In business or financial dealings your innate creativity and investigative abilities will take you far. You are the consummate detective. You will probably like working for yourself rather than being part of the establishment or a corporation.                In love and relationships you are affectionate, sensitive and loyal but also may be easily hurt or imposed upon. You enjoy and need companionship but must judge wisely any long term involvement's. Take relationship training and life will be more rewarding.

Xy4kHpteaa	Here's the thing: "Skins", for me was always this little guilty pleasure, I almost don't want to like it because it's so overly dramatic and a little, well let's face it, insanely ridiculous sometimes. But I can't help it, I love it.<br>  <br>  When I heard about the all the original actors being sacked for a new cast, I was a bit sceptical. Honestly, I like the new series, I don't think it's nearly as powerful, or even as disturbing, as the first and second but so far I think the show is really good. I think it's best to wait a while and see where it goes, but so far, I like it and think there's definite potential. That being said, I don't think the show accurately depicts Britain's teenagers at all but I don't think it's supposed to either. The show is about a few teen's lives, saying that it's about everyone's life is just over-reaching. Some kids are huge party kids, who have lots of sex and get trashed all the time,others never do that stuff and wouldn't dream of it, and others (which I feel is about average for teens) are caught somewhere in the middle. But no, life is not nearly that dramatic|`|yGWoxnDXaa	I don't like the series as much as the old one but i don't mind it.<br>  <br>  It does reflect the lives of us british teenagers i think, i know a lot of people like cook/thomas/pandora/effy etc.|`|PxAfu96faa	i think it does reflect teenagers in Britain, but its more emphasized to be entertaining and watchable.|`|ebWUWk04aa	i love the new one it is much better and yes i do think it reflects teenage life now and i love freddie|`|bddfAvXnaa	I think the new series is good, but I much preferred the first two. The characters don't resemble anyone I know, and personally I think they have just taken the characters too far. No-one is like JJ with his magic tricks and I can't see how JJ, Cook and Freddie would remain friends in real life with their obvious differences in attitude and personality.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	The new series isnt nearly as powerful and the first three episodes absolutely blew but it is looking up. Its not a patch on the old series, its all just about getting high and sex now, not in the least shocking, but its more watchable now. I think all the girls have the best characters, the boys are either boring or total stereotypes.|`|QmU9XA9Jaa	I was very apprehensive to begin with but now i'm starting to get into it...I definitely think it's a bit far-fetched but enjoyable at the same time!  The last series was more real...and I thought that with the new characters the show could have gone bottoms-up but I think that the original audience are very interested in what the new series will bring to the table.  My friends and I are looking forward to it anyway...

zBkaqIWcaa	"Stand by Me", excellent movie, based on the novel "The Body" by Stephen King.    The older guys did not killed the dead boy.  One of them found the body who was accidentally killed by a train and talk to other firends about it.  That conversation was heard by one of the younger kids who decide to make a trip to find the body and report its location to the authorities.     The kids:  River Phoenix as Chris Chambers,  Wil Wheaton as Gordie LaChance,  Corey Feldman as Teddy Duchamp,  Jerry O'Connell as Vern Tessio.    Kiefer Sutherland as Ace Miller (leader of the older boys).  John Cussak makes a cameo as Gordie older brother, who hjas died a year or so before the start of the film.  Richard Dreyfus plays the riole of adult Gordie the writter / narrator of the film.|`|84db822e80c8ab6223d50689fd25b00aaa	Stand By Me|`|NmSSKnnWaa	stand by me.river phoenix was in it.good film|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Stand by me, it was 1980's great film|`|nci2WOYXaa	Stand By Me.

She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..    She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change  She was leaving  I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out,  God, I believe her now  Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend  If they've seen her, they ain't sayin, they ain't sayin...

T1T4vIZoaa	Oh, come on! This is ridiculous! Stop ranting and just face the facts! People who hate the Jonas Brothers can be occasionally disrespectful because people like you drive us to it with your daft questions! Most girls who like the Jonas Brothers are no older than 14 and nobody is gonna write you two paragraphs about anyone!    But I hate them because...    1. They are not worth the hype they are getting from their extremely annoying fans!  2. Their music is beyond bad!|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Can I tell you, this is a retarded question; you're acting like some strict teacher.     NO ONE is gonna be bothered to write 2 paragraphs just because you're tired of seeing short or 'unreasonable' answers - because there's nothing wrong with them.     It's Y! A! Go do this in Homework Help, if you're that concerned about how people write. It's THEIR CHOICE and it DOESN'T MATTER.|`|k39bNUgeaa	I hate them     1.They are an annoying disney boy band    2. You fans are very annoying|`|dOkw3xhcaa	1. They are Christians    2. I like their music. That's an obvious reason. Why else would I like them if didn't like their music?! You don't need two paragraphs, this reason is good enough.    Edit: I'm 15 and I like bands because of their MUSIC not because of looks. It doesn't really matter to me if the entire world hates the jonas brothers and their music. I like it and I like other bands that some jonas brothers haters like. It all depends on your taste of music. I'm not stupid so don't go telling people to stop and think about why we like bands. What kind of question is this?|`|R6Hp8CGwaa	I love the jonas brothers.     1. they are great singers  2. they are hot.|`|OpzlLXyPaa	my top two reasons for liking the jonas brothers are:    1. personalities..kevin nick and joe are greath guys! they care about their fans and try to do anything they can to keep the fans happy! also they are such gentlemen. nick always talks about holding the door for a girl or pulling out her chair. if only all guys were like that. *sighs*    2. music..these days all the music you here is about drugs and sex and all that stuff. i rather not listen to that kind of music. i think it's reallllyy annoying. the jonas brothers sing about clean things. they sing about love, and break-ups, and make-ups. and the songs have meaning. i mean if you listen to the first song kevin nick and joe wrote together (its called "please be mine") there is true meaning behind it. "but i'll be there forever/you will see that it's better/all our hopes and our dreams will come true"..those lyrics are beautiful. and i am not saying that all the rap music has no meaning. im just saying that i think its annoying.|`|3OmYQT1Maa	Sorry I'm kind of in a hurry so I'm not going to write paragraphs but...    Two reasons why I like them (though I'm not much of a fan) would be...    1. They write their own music, sing well, play well, and put a lot of effort into what they do.    2. They wear promise rings, choosing to abstain from sex before marriage. I'm a christian so that is important to me.    =]

cQAULrHaaa	Hannah Montana: The Movie has been confirmed by many of the stars from the show. It will not be a Disney Channel Original Movie, but will instead follow in the steps of the Lizzie McGuire series, which is a feature-length film released in cinemas.     Filming was scheduled to take place May 2008, and should be released on April 10, 2009. Oprah Winfrey also confirmed on her show on November 21, 2007 that a film was in the works.|`|EVDh4emTaa	The movie is to be released on april the 10 2009.

Oen4BdNYaa	I would say we dont glorify our artist no more than rock stars but it does effect some blacks.   1.The way some of these men dress  --Alot of us(even whites) get our new fashion from hip hop    2.The dances that are in these videos we copy those for the clubs.    3.If rappers are from the hood it gives u hope you can make it also even through rappin. We cant relate with rock stars so we tend to fly towards people who look like us.    -------------BAD PART----------------    1.The disrespect these men have for women effects younger men. They see these rappers glorifying azz and tatas all day long and not respecting women so they are going to bring the same "WUSUP LIL MAMA" attitude. Yes these women hold responsibility but you can be fully dressed and still be disrespected    2. Black men or rappers have started this mainly uplifting light skin women in their videos. All you hear is red bone this or yellow chick that. Not even caring that they are forgetting about their brown sisters. So you have young men on the street copying the same thing.    3. As far as women, all we see is these big booty,women with thick thighs and that is mostly what is uplifted(nothing wrong with big butts cause i have one) but it makes other black women feel they have to compete by gaining weight which is totally the oposite for white women who uplift breast.    4. I dont like they way Pimp, Playa, Thug is glorified in rap. So street men feel the need to be hard or act hard as well. So there is no crying in rap. It is not "gangsta" to uplift faithfulness or family or especially marriage in rap. You must be the playa type.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	1. It gives voice to the often voiceless  2. I don't care anymore. I used to be bothered by the misogyny but now I don't care, as I've gotten older, worrying about that has become less important.  3. N/A  4. No, clowns existed back then too, same with bafoons.  5. Yes, not everything should be taken literally.|`|GnYw9Pvwaa	I don't think I act like a rapper, it's stupid to think all black people like hip hop and think they're all pimps with ghetto chains. Those of us scholar gentry and of the middle class are just like the rest of you. White people and black people think women are sex symbols if they're perverted, it ain't about race. I sometimes think black racism also exists towards white people, and that's coming from a black person. We get way too involved in our race sometimes. If martin luther king jr. had been here he'd reprimand us for segregating ourselves.|`|OD3hxWxvaa	This is SOOOOOOOO racist.                             i'm just kidding im a white person.|`|2kpcVAMkaa	its 'affects' not effects  I ain't black, but I think young black males do look up to rappers and their life style, although its parents responsibility how individual grows up. Same way Miley Cyrus influences young white girls. These images of rappers can be detremental to adolescents psych because there aren't enough  black role models unlike Obama. So yes rap does have negative affects on people; such as disrespecting women, choosing to join gangs etc....but its important to have positive influence like Rakim,Nas. 90% of rappers are negative, only underground rappers talk about positive images.

h6JJNgoKaa	The John Philip Sousa's band did play mostly marches.  However they also had to play classical and the music of the day.  They were tasked for most government playing gigs.   These gigs can range in difference from receptions, strawberry socials, parades, concerts, dances.  The list just goes on from here.  For a more complete answer go to Marine Band History .|`|sc4BtGxGaa	Well - all his famous marches, for certain.  But he also wrote operettas, waltzes, and many other forms of music.  Being the Marine Band director for many years did require him to write in a specific style - and then, he type-cast himself.  I have played these SO often, that I can probably play ALL of the piccolo parts to the marches by memory - they just sink in.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Marches. He wrote many of America's best military marches.|`|jbAr62ybaa	Mostly marches; a goodly number of which he wrote himself; very famous in his day:<br>  .<br>       Here's one of his most famous compositions - "The Stars and Stripes Forever":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyPc_sZTZUs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyPc_sZTZ...</a><br>  <br>                                                     Alberich|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Marches.
