The people are scummy, dirty, smelly and really rude. They are so caught up in their own life, they only associate with other people from Seattle.<br>  <br>  No, I am not socially retarded, I am a normal person, and these people are goofy. They all have the same opinion, and they all love to start internet fights when you go to a message board and ask a simple, legitimate question.<br>  <br>  Despite what the city looks like in pictures, there are bums EVERYWHERE, and the traffic is worse than New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles because there are only two roads.<br>  <br>  Short answer: Seattle is a horrible, horrible place known for horrible music.|`|Ly420Xzkaa	I LOVE Seattle! I love being by the water. One day I walked around downtown, and just fell in love. I saw the Pike Place Fish Market, and just found it to be such an interesting place to be.

9oiq4tZYaa	well when you find someone thats always right i might kill myself ok |`|6g7gmxzWaa	No, because making mistake makes you learn more, being always right isn't going to make you the brightest.<br>  <br>  Also, making mistake is a part of life, even the most smartest person in the world isn't always right!|`|aTIUotAtaa	no if your right all the time what do you have to learn?<br>  <br>  learning is part of life. so beng right all the time is not living it up|`|r7dV5JzBaa	sometimes, if you want people to think that you are smart. other times it might be bad because they might think that you are just a know it all.            soooo... it depends on the situation  =)|`|UPcRUvHpaa	i am never right, i think i'm right, i want to be right, no i'm never right..........i just guess alot......lmao!?|`|hg5Li3vXaa	No, because no body is Always right, and if you think you are always right you're wrong!|`|3bLNyHIgaa	sometimes it is|`|XbKbsSzfaa	teachers pet kinda... take it from my friend megan. talk about show-off!|`|q7CsV2JWaa	We supposed to learn from our mistakes right?<br>  <br>  If you never make one.

NO|`|T2ggkg8baa	i dont think so either i greee wih yyou!?!?!!?!?|`|W61RZCDoaa	you're right, being right isn't always a good thing.  For one thing, we need mistakes to learn.  For another, being right makes life boring.  <br>  <br>  Also, look at it this way:  Hitler thought he was right to believe that the Aryan race was superior, and that everyone else was trash.  If that was suppose to be a good thing, then hell, I don't know what's good anymore.|`|aYObfI2Haa	Being right is ok, But it can be annoying Amongst  a group of people, wether friends or not.  Examples of people who R always right & some  who wont admit to being wrong (U can figure which 1 is the smart butt n which wont Accept defeat by never admiting they'r wrong) :: bill O' reilley, Star Jones, John Mccain, Fox News, <br>  George Bush, Elizabeth Hassleback<-- d(-_-)b, I can almost hear her, omg!<br>  and etc.|`|OV81p2sGaa	It has benefits and downfall. It is good to know alot because it can help you in life but being a know-it-all can be very annoying . Some people don't appreciate it if you are always right or you act like you are at least. But is impossible to always be right anyway. :)|`|4E9fQwj2aa	It can help in a debate. Basically, I don't talk too much about things I know nothing about. I do prefer facts as opposed to opinions though. Especially when it comes to running the country.|`|96R8YCWqaa	Depends on what you're referring to.<br>  Being wrong can be costly sometimes<br>  Imagine a general being wrong about the enemy's location, and as a result sends his men into an ambush.|`|ZKXm2RUyaa	well if you think your always right than you need to grow up because that most likely just means that your stubborn or your around 2nd graders all day.|`|SHANPm2Raa	u dnt always have to be right sometimes u can compromise or  mor like myself u can agree to disagree|`|xp9wVaUzaa	no, you can never always be right|`|p8i8UxyPaa	ppl probably call you things behind your backk sry bro.   they'll talk there **** and call you a goodie good.. good luck with tht<br>  |`|vXSXfKhOaa	well it depends on the situation<br>  <br>  love the pic by the way!|`|3b0b6e383b2fd77db8e642c29f9a1eccaa	no becuase whats the point of talking and having a fight plus it make people hate u if u are|`|Sl3Gi4UVaa	no, it pisses people off<br>  |`|WR4cYLd4aa	No way for sure!

If anything, you learn from it!  <br>  <br>  |`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	No as long as it isn't affecting you.|`|CpTQagJOaa	No....being wrong is part of learning new things.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	no, because people that "think" they are always right become a holes.|`|hwEQH1tpaa	No, of course not. If you're always right, people will feel like they have to be smart to hang out and be your friend. If you're too smart, you'll make other people feel stupid and scare them away.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you a little story about my sister. My sister's friend is a little weird but very intelligent at the same time. They have known each other but the older they got, the more smart her friend was. On top of that, she ate her boogers until she was 15. <br>  <br>  My parents always thought it was rude not to hang out with her because they felt bad but they didn't see that she was really annoying. Sure, my sister felt bad for the poor girl because she had no friends, but at the same time, she didn't because she couldn't have a conversation with her without her using long words and other topics my sister didn't understand. <br>  <br>  So the point is, is that being smart and "knowing everything" is not always a good thing. You might get far in life, but as the friends and popularity level goes, you won't have any friends but maybe 1 or 2.|`|cY3GdDA3aa	No, sometimes being wrong lets you learn why you're wrong. <br>  <br>  You should learn from mistakes.<br>  <br>  Nobody's perfect...|`|rUNlmQG5aa	If it doesn't get you killed first it can be very profitable.|`|vVLwrzGbaa	No, that's not really a good thing...|`|AyPOc8WNaa	nope, you learn from the things you do wrong.|`|WnoHELH5aa	no cuz you will never have any mistakes to learn from|`|fprEm2JXaa	i don't think it is <br>  <br>  because everyone is gonna be wrong some day ya know|`|o49LMHwvaa	no.<br>  people will think ur too serious &&smart.<br>  its unhealthy for the mind=D
fc0u5YWiaa	Robin is kind of unlady like.

8f8b918d1198f1e196976002004cf9eeaa	Ok so next time pay for the movie and sneak snacks in.|`|bda465ikaa	For well over a decade theaters have not made a profit on the tickets. They make all their profit on overcharging for snacks. In some sense they almost make out if you sneak into a second movie since the use of the empty seat doesn't cost them anything and you are more likely to buy the overpriced snacks since you are spending four or more hours in the theater.|`|lRlSa34Aaa	its so ridiculous!!<br>  the movie costa alot as it is..<br>  lol|`|Qc1PenNSaa	Woah, calm down there Sparky.<br>  <br>  I worked at a movie theatre for over a year, and that admission price you pay goes to the stars, not to the theatre. The theatre gets 10% from admission sells, if they're lucky.<br>  <br>  The only money they get to keep 100% of is the profits from the concession stand. [that sentence sounds horrible... sorry, long day, bad grammar]<br>  But anyways, the only profits the theatre really gets is from the food that they sell.Theatres seem like they make a lot of money by jacking up prices on everything, but they really don't. <br>  <br>  Hope that clears a couple things up.<br>  <br>  And by the way, Bolt was awesome! :]<br>  haha|`|vigFmfLmaa	It's Karma biting you in the *** for sneaking into the free movie!<br>  <br>  Seriously, yes it's expensive.  Because they know you will buy it.  Just like how sodas are $1.50 - $3 at restaurants b/c you will buy them.|`|eitqO5Rmaa	For many movie theater patrons, the experience is not complete without snacks such as popcorn, candy or sodas. The idea of sinking down into a seat with a bag of buttery popcorn in one hand and an ice-cold drink in the other holds a special appeal to many movie buffs. But why do these familiar snacks cost so much in movie theaters? The answer lies in the economic realities of most locally-owned or chain theaters.<br>  <br>  One reason snacks cost so much in movie theaters is exclusivity. If a customer gets hungry or thirsty in an average movie theater, he or she has only one option. It's not as if a hungry theater patron can pause the movie at some point and order a meal from a nearby restaurant. The theater's concession stand is generally the only sanctioned source for food and drink, so the theater's manager can legally place a substantial surcharge on sales. This is the same reason why snacks can also be more expensive at convenience stores or airports. The venue literally has a captive audience, and cheaper outside food can be confiscated without penalty.<br>  <br>  Another reason snacks cost so much in movie theaters is the surprisingly low profit margin of an average theater. There are a substantial number of overhead costs associated with running a movie theater, including the salaries of the projectionists, concession workers, ticket sellers, ushers, managers and maintenance crews. Managers must also negotiate with distributors for the exclusive right to show popular titles. It is not unusual for a local movie theater to barely break even or even lose money on the movies themselves. They can offset many of these losses by increasing the prices of snack foods and drinks.<br>  <br>  There are many theater patrons who either refuse to buy concessions because of the exorbitant prices or attempt to smuggle outside food and drink into the theater. Ironically, it's partially because of these practices that snacks cost so much in movie theaters. Customers who do buy their popcorn, sodas and candies at the theater's concession stand are often making up for the ones who don't. In this sense, snacks cost so much in movie theaters for the same reason bandages cost so much in hospitals — those who can afford to pay the higher prices are helping to recoup the venue's losses from those who can't.

You should be able to enjoy yourself even if you dont drink. This is the way i see it, drinking is ok if you like it and can be quite relaxing if your drinking in a more relaxed environment such as in a quiet bar or while out for a meal or even at home, if you drink while in a club the upsides include more confidence and being able to 'fit in' with eveyone else. The downsides are that if you drink to excess you will lose control of what you are doing, people can take advantage of you, you are more likely to be aggressive when drunk and start fights which you will lose as you dont have all your senses, also if you meet someone you like while your drunk, you are more likely to forget what happened and its the same with everything that happens during the evening but if you dont drink then you will remember what happens and have some fond memories. All this is based on my own experiences.<br>  Dont be dependant on alcohol for anything, it will only lead to trouble|`|TO4bRflyaa	Listen dear, if you haven't tried alcohol a lot, then you are lucky.

But don't become an alcoholic, control your drinking and just a small suggestion. If you ever come across drinking games and you've just started drinking. I wouldn't until you've become a casual drinker. Just lookin' out. But as for hard liquors, take a little at a time. Take shots, there not so bad once you get it down real fast. It'll all become real familiar to you.

3N2ElzcQaa	Because we girls are just too picky and are stuck in the imaginary world.<br>  <br>  Look, you shouldn't judge a guy like that. Sure, the guys around the block aren't our choices of dating, but we shouldn't judge them based on looks alone. Consider their personality as well. <br>  <br>  Its a hard and cruel world. <br>  <br>  You'll find your guy. Just don't be so harsh on the looks.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	'Cause, y'know, girls in real life totally are...oh wait.<br>  <br>  One thing anyone will quickly notice about anime is that it tends to be strongly idealized.  The Japanese have an amazing ability to idealize aspects of life.<br>  Take childhood, for instance.  You'll notice that many anime revolve around school life, and share many similar themes -- few responsibilities (or actively dodging them), expressing emotion, and so on.<br>  <br>  The human figure, male and female, just gets painted with the same brush.|`|6ZiIw4ugaa	Why can't girls in real life be as sexy and cool as the girls in anime?<br>  <br>  (I really don't give a s*** about anime)|`|TkPJYlaMaa	Because the crerators made them like that, ao of course they're perfect.<br>  Normal boys are NO WAY NEAR PERFECT|`|iAZMI6UCaa	Date a gay guy I hear a lot of  girls say there cool and sexy.

Everyone just prefers fictional characters because they can make them into whoever they want them to be. But, if you think of it, can an anime character fulfill your pleasures? Can they make you happy? Can they share the love you have for them? All the answers are NO. <br>  <br>  Real guys have real emotions. Anime characters do not. So, since real guys are real, they are obviously better than the ones who are not real. Also, comparing a real person to an anime character is not correct - they are two completely different things and are not meant to be compared. If you keep comparing the two, you will never find happiness with someone who is actually in your reach. Also, don't base everything on looks. Personality is way more important. If you base everything on looks, what kind of relationship will you end up having? A shallow and fake one. Is that what you want? Take a look at the guys around you - I'm sure there's one there who has a great personality and is way better than any anime character.

If it's just a small sample of a larger story, it's a good start.  I feel you could benefit from re-naming your characters.  It seems like you just picked names out of the tabloids instead of thinking about what the names actually mean and how they influence their personalities.  Start by checking out baby name websites that list what the names mean.  Lastly, the phrase "salivating gleam" didn't make sense to me.  Maybe a "wanting gleam" or something other than "salivating."<br>  <br>  Edit:  No problem.  The tabloid comment was more in reference to the last names (Perry, Aniston & Simpson).  I still feel like the first names could be improved.  Shelly just feels generic.  Unless you're going for an "every girl" kind of feel for her.|`|Z832eggnaa	well i guess i'm one of the only kind people who is going to respond to this. i read all of it and it's really good,really well-written. is it for school or something? i wish i could write like that.|`|09hdBrpGaa	I thought it was really good.

I also want to add how happy I am that you mentioned Tony, he is one of my favorite guitarists, but never gets any attention, like Saraceno. Saraceno, McAlpine, Vai, Satch, Gilbert, and Eric Johnson are the best 80s guitarists as far as I'm concerned.|`|3c8f4e75997fa4e2743ad3bbb5cf864baa	Sure, I've heard of him...Great Guitarist.

But if thats what you do for fun, you can keep writing songs, they just aren't good.|`|wxz9mmMWaa	i don know?....if i know the rhythm probaly|`|83pyUYI4aa	i like it.i bet this song is going to be good =]|`|t4MN8gcMaa	ha ha i think it actually sounds kinda cool i had a rhythm in my head too  haha but in my head it sounds cool|`|VgR0Mfcmaa	Ya know, it's kinda catchy - and I'm an old guy {okay 40..ish}. Here's how I see it being done.<br>  2 guys, 1 dressed preppy and the other sloppy. Both sing their own parts then sing the chorus together.<br>  Heck, if you want to go that far, you can have a couple of other people singing to a "Jocks" stanza, "Nerds" stanza, etc... Done right, you can bring all together, looking at all sides in just the one song.<br>  Another thing, if by chance you do some sort of video, the same person could dress for each "part" and sing it, bringing it all together for the chorus.<br>  <br>  I think you can actually go somewhere with this if you work at it. If this is what comes out when you get bored, I hope you get bored more often. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Peace to you and yours,<br>  Matthew "Dra'Gon" Stohler<br>  <br>  P.S.

m4bdHnKKaa	well you want me to tell you everything that happened...<br>  so here it is<br>  <br>  <br>  adrian forgets to plan amys baby shower and she didnt get anything ready so everyone who was expecting to go to her baby shower was mad  because they werent invited so grace comes to help adrian out and amys dad finally found a home and hes moving out and ashley is moving with him but the mom doesnt know. so anyways grace gets joe (the guy who made the fake id's) to invite some random people to the party because noone was coming. meanwhile grace invites jack over to help her blow up balloons but they end up making out and shawna (jacks gf) can tell he's cheating so she goes to the baby shower to figure with who he's cheating on her with. Then adrians brothers (the guy she is going out with) comes over which he is told not to (because they were gna send him to military camp.) he comes over and brings a condom and they are about to go and have sex (right before the baby shower) then grace walks in then walks out then after the baby shower adrians dad walks in and catches them and he's gna send his son to military camp. His son(i forgot his name) said he didnt care cause he loved adrian but adrian didnt love him. Then ricky is talking to his foster mom and she tells him that he will be a great dad and that he's ready. Then amy is going to the baby shower but she like collapses( not really she just cant walk) outside the door and someone finds her and tells her mom and her mom amy ashely and their dad go to the hospital. There she asked ashely to be in the room with her. Ben comes and she tells ben she doesnt want him in the room. Then ben tells her to call ricky and they call ricky and tell him to come. And jack and shawna break up but she still wants him to come be a mentor..<br>  <br>  <br>  woo that was alot im pretty sure i didnt forget anything<br>  i hope i didnt give too much info out!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ooh one more thing<br>  grace told her mom that she needed to talk about something serious and her mom was all like is it about the birth control pills i gave you and she doesnt respond and then they just leave it at that..okay now im done!|`|Q08GpskDaa	Well, Adrian and Grace were going to throw her a baby shower, and Adrian spends basically the whole party in her room with her stepbrother. And George is going to move out. On her way the the shower, Amy goes into labor.

He confirmed that they had broken up and he will see Leila as much as he wants when he gets off of tour. As for now, he talks to Gab when he calls to tell Leila he loves and misses her. <br>  <br>  I don't know if that's the same thing you heard..|`|dbf8cd4de5eb3051693b6ace6a00274caa	they broke up. it even says single on his myspace

(how much is pani puri...) obviously the policeman had no idea and so jamal proved his point that a person learns by living. do you get what i mean?|`|cfbca97f9019fff3dca0112376930239aa	Jai hooooooooo!

OcUP8JOBaa	Geez...a very tough (but good) question.  I'm a huge Dean Martin fan.<br>  <br>  His most famous song is "Everybody Loves Somebody".  However, other popular songs include "Volare", "Ain't That a Kick in the Head", "Memories Are Made of This", "That's Amore", Almost Like Being in Love", "Houston", "You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You" and the Italian version of "Come Back to Sorrento" and Mambo Italiano".<br>  <br>  See, very tough question!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|WUZwxdICaa	how do you want it....

khU8m4gxaa	Women are too often judged by looks. That's why a rapper like Lil' Kim or Trina rely on sexuality to sell. It's been a male dominated industry since it began. 30 years and women haven't taken over. Another reason is that there's just not a lot of female MC's in general. You mention Lauryn & Amanda, but Lauryn hasn't released any music in close to a decade and Amanda Diva still hasn't dropped a CD. Not even with Floetry. There are only a handful of female rappers, some very talented, but just never enough to make a huge impact. If a female rapper comes out & really explodes on the scene, reliant entirely on skills more so than over image, then maybe it would create a trend, but that hasn't happened. Hip Hop is a type of music that is macho & braggadocios just by nature, so that doesn't fit most women well as a performer.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	Unfortunately, probably not.  To get into the industry as a female emcee, most major record labels won't sign you unless you're showing a lot of skin and those artists are usually wack.  The ones who actually have skills and refuse to get signed based on their sex appeal don't get recognized.  Just look at Jean Grae.|`|zp8gLEz8aa	women will NEVER take over. I'm a girl, and i hate to say that. There are girls out there that can flow, but they're not getting any attention. Record labels dont want true artists, they want slutty rappers such as trina. They dont sign women like MC Lyte, da Brat, and Queen latifah anymore. And plus, how many men do you know would bump a woman's album in their car anyway? think about it.|`|XDvOwLlNaa	Women have never taken over anything...except stuff nobody cares about, like being maids or waitresses<br>  <br>  So i really doubt it...<br>  <br>  its the truth!...i dont even listen to ANY female rappers|`|qMrIFglwaa	It's a man's world, <br>  but it would be nothing without the women and the girls|`|uZQIUeyvaa	no, rap was created as a mans game and will always stay one.|`|61DGMv52aa	Men are not takin over the rap game.There are more male rappers then female rappers.There is Lil Wayne, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Pharrell, Common, 50 Cent, The Game, Jadakiss, Nas, Styles P, Ludacris.The women are Beyonce, Rihanna, Keri Hilson, Natasha, Keyshia Cole, Remy Ma, Lil Mama.The men call girls b****** but the girls dont mind them.The rap industry is equal is men and ladies but men rap more.DJ Kool Herc made hip hop so men were following hip hop more then ladies.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And Lil Kim and Trina use their body to rap like Lil Kim stole biggie from faith.Trina dated a lot of men in the rap game to rap.Then she used her body to sell cuz men were gettin hypnotize to buy her records.|`|f5rFXChYaa	Haha hell yeah!<br>  <br>  That'd be sweet;;<br>  It's true alotta women with flows don't get signed because they don't do the sexuality thing;;<br>  But straight up check this ****..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=196718587" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a><br>  <br>  Her name is Bossalini..<br>  She got flow;;<br>  Don't get me wrong alot of it's about sex and what not but girl got mad **** going on for her.

ZcV4zmpxaa	Okay I finished most of the manga up to volume 20 something. Watch the anime too. Anime was crap, manga way better. Now onto your question, Kyoshiro has a reason that he cannot fight for he sworn not to fight again. <br>  <br>  SPOILER!:<br>  Kyoshiro and Kyo are both the same person, they are basicly two different personalities separated by a ritual. Kyoshiro is the original, he just didnt like his bad personality so he separated him and his dark side by a ritual. And Kyo was formed after the Ritual. They are both equal in strength.

UDqgJAFEaa	I HATE TAYLOR LAUTNER AND I HATE JACOB too<br>  <br>  well i think rob looks much better and taylor sucks he is looking baadd<br>  ok everyone i know -except my mother- hates jacob/ taylor and jacob has a character that everyone hates and rob plays edward cullen?? <br>  and what about you ?? will you love rob or taylor??<br>  <br>  17 4ever|`|A2XzcMu0aa	No. Even if Taylor gets more screen time, everyone will always keep scream for ROB, ROB, ROB! :)<br>  <br>  Jacob SUCKS!!!|`|pLD3pYsuaa	I think yeah Taylor Lautner is going to get more fans when New Moon hits theathers, i mean the whole book is mostly based on him and Bella like Edward only comes out in the end of the book, but I still like Robert Pattinson more.|`|ifYOXajoaa	Dear Jenna S,<br>  <br>  This is the same question i thought of. I think their more "Taylor Fans" will probably watch it, and the "Robert/Edward Fans" will probably be sorta upset since there isn't much of Robert/Edward in New Moon. LoL Personally i will NEVER stop loving Robert. I mean, yea i like Jacob/ Taylor. <br>  <br>  This is also in my opinion. I think their will be people that will go watch New Moon and probably be upset for how little parts Robert got. I think other people will go and ill watch it and go crazy that Taylor steals the spot light, Finally! and i think other people will be like, Edward is awesome, Jacob is awesome! And just love the movie either way if there is more Jake and Less Edward! But also this is in my opinion. Which i think that will really happen, You know? LoL*|`|Q7Ed9UHIaa	Phssss nope. People already have there fav in the book. So they will stick to what they chose in Twilight.<br>  <br>  Im gonna be there in my Team Edward shirt, screaming "ROB RULEZ!" lol|`|F338culUaa	I Think Both Of Them Would Be Loved As Much=]<br>  <br>  Their Both Awesome=D|`|TuygBbDAaa	okay my opinion is that i always like robert pattinson and probably always will. i like taylor launter too but not as much. so for me no but it may persuade othe people to like him. and he did get bigger because i saw a picture of him recently and he did get bigger in the facce and body.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D|`|FcbRUYExaa	Okay. IN THE BOOKS. Jacob GREW UP.. and i mean UP.. i think Taylor Lautner is a little short and a little skinny in comparison to how the book made Jacob out to be after he began 'changing', you know? So i can not help but wonder if Taylor Lautner might be replaced with someone else, unless he decides to bulk up? IN which case... if it was by the book descriptions... he will be at least 6 foot and with a body.. well with a 'BODY', so what girls would NOT want that???|`|IKnEeMXLaa	I think they will like Taylor better when Rob leaves, but it will be the same mix when Rob comes back|`|VigZs9nxaa	I think the people will like it equally.THEY ARE BOTH REALLY REALLY HOTT.=]
i8Rt8prsaa	eww..yea i heard about Drew Barrymore directing Eclipse.and i'm not gonna see it if it turns out that she will.but if she doesn't than i'd go and see it FOR SURE THE DAY IT COMES OUT!!! :DD haha|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	Eclipse movie?  what happened to New Moon???????<br>  I never saw the Twilight movie anyways, I just like the books and I totally don't understand Breaking Dawn.  Too innocent :)|`|uNIHqmH8aa	um... won't be coming for another what? two years? Besides, I'm currently extremely ticked at the fact that Vanessa hugents or whatever her name is is playing Leah....<br>  <br>  -Nov|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Why does it matter? It's invariably gonna suck.<br>  LIked the books, though.|`|yRNW0Utbaa	me, but i don't think that they should use lucas grabeel as Alec, he is not vampire material|`|lnRMmSeyaa	well i would see it, but if it was bad i would not see Breaking Dawn is she directed it again|`|rS04obBgaa	i will|`|f0JL2cHEaa	I couldn't care less.|`|NqKIhjdmaa	Me! I can't wait until November 20th, 2009 because New Moon is my favorite one!

IM NOT A BIG FAN|`|67dWrrH9aa	I'm goign to cry for you right now. bye bye.|`|jaMq6rGuaa	I don't know really.<br>  <br>  I'm most likely not even going to watch the movies, because the movies are never as good as the book.And I don't want the book to be ruined for me.|`|JLP5IhFDaa	I love drew barrymore and I'd be very interested to see what she can do with it. She would probably bring out the more mystical and magical side.|`|6WPQxzDTaa	ME i don't want her to especially becuase she's a new director so she'll probably fu  ck it up like cathinre hardwick did|`|SzDfQjvIaa	he probaly wont chris will prob still direct. Btw I would be so MAD! and tell EVERYONE not to see it!

oAMmIbRVaa	With your future wife being a Gemini and your an aries it seems that you could be just fine. Gemini?is most compatible with Leo, Libra, Aquarius and?Aries. The?Gemini?personality however is incompatible with Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces and Taurus. As?a Gemini?though you can work well with another Gemini and the Sagittarius?sign.|`|CG7DAJAxaa	Only you and your precious know when.  When the time is right.|`|GZOutyQwaa	Dude why do you listen to that bullshit...<br>  <br>  If you love her marry her. If it was meant to be it will all work out for the best.|`|S6m6ymNvaa	I think so. You guys are VERY compatible. Does this sound familiar...<br>  <br>  The Gemini woman will have sex on her mind no matter what sign she’s with since her ruling planet is intellectual Mercury. However when she meets up with an Aries man, things will progress out of her mind and into the physical realm in no time! In this love match the Gemini woman is swept away by the sexual directness of her Aries man. He’ll be blunt in talking to her about what he wants, when he wants it and how he plans on getting it and she’ll enjoy every minute of the stimulating conversation. The Aries man needs to feel a sense of conquering from the very first date, and the Gemini woman will come up with a variety of ideas to make him feel like he’s always winning the prize! <br>  <br>  I THINK YOU GUYS WILL BE JUST FINE!

rZQYCpabaa	I only watch amc, not guiding light so I don't know how RPG and BE were on that soap but on AMC?  The mistake was trying to pair Jake and Taylor when they have no chemistry from the start on AMC and ruining Jake/Amanda's cute thing they had going on.  <br>  <br>  Taylor should go with Brot or Tad.  Amanda needs to be with Jake.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I have watched both for a very long time.

CwBVLFPTaa	I don't know because season 2 hasn't started yet but I'm dying to know as well seeing as how this my favorite new show. But if you find out I would seriously love to know.  <br>  <br>  On a serious note this is what happened in the episode I think your talking about:<br>  <br>  *Adrian was in charge of the baby shower. She didn't send out any invitations and everyone was upset because  they thought they didn't get invited.<br>  <br>  *Grace and Jack came over to help with the baby shower. They kissed and Adrian kind of caught them.<br>  <br>  *Adrian was worried/mad that Max hadn't called or came to see her in awhile.<br>  <br>  *Max came by to say that her dad took his cell phone away from him and told him if they continued to see each other he was sending him to military camp.<br>  <br>  *Jack's girlfriend Shauna suspected Jack was cheating. She ultimately broke up with him saying that she was about to be 21 and there was too much of an age difference between the 2.<br>  <br>  *Max gives Adrian a "gift" which turns out to be a condom. The 2 have sex and get caught by Grace first and then by her dad who threatens to send both to military camp. Max confesses his love for Adrian who in turn doesn't say it back.

efBnVVgcaa	I think that an American version would be really interesting to watch.  I feel that the same cultural emotions would be pretty hard to show.  In that aspect, I feel that the American version would lose a lot of the feelings of saving and such a close family relationship as Makino's. However, I totally agree.  The plot is really good and it would be really fun to see how they made it.  However, I doubt that they will cast an American version of this.  Casting-wise, I'm not so sure but they must be extremely crucial when choosing the guy to play Hanazawa Rui.  I think that the choices so far have been really good, especially in Boys Before Flowers.

It was quite funny.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another time? Well about 2 weeks ago Me and my friends Charles, Marissa, and Holly went to the library and called my ex boyfriend and he went along with it. Charles was telling him that his name was LaToya Jackson and that he needed to pay his child support before his daughter starved to death. And we kept passing the phone around telling him all these things. It was beyond funny. I really wish I would've recorded it. And it was funny because since he went a long with it (well, we called him while he was at work) and I guess he had one of his co-workers talking with us and the guy was like "Yeah, let me give you back to the king of the store." And I was like...wtf?<br>  <br>  =)|`|aNIiGpzeaa	yeah, i do it all the time!!<br>  <br>  so me and my friends were in my room, and someone decided to pick up the phone and do prank calls. so, i talk in a  really deep manly voice and one of my friends talk in an old woman voice.<br>  <br>  so, the man (me) goes ''sharon! i got her message thing'' and the woman (my friend) goes ''go away bert'' and then she acts like he barged into the bathroom while masturbating in a really wierd way.<br>  so, my friend starts screaming like ''get out bert'' and he goes ''why dont you ever do that with me?'' and then the woman voice starts screaming inaudible babble. it was so funny. we played it back and i was laughin so hard, i fell off the bed!!|`|y3qClcDyaa	i tried. but i cant without cracking up laughing|`|Co9I2OMSaa	yeah i have.  once i called someone and told them (it was a he) that he left his tampon in the mcdonald's bathroom and he needed to come pick it up.  it was so funny because he's like, how did you know i was at mcdonald's!?!  oh my gosh, i laughed and almost peed my pants!<br>  i don't fake a voice... i dial *69 so it's not like they're going to know who's calling|`|sBVIAh3waa	nope i havent|`|iO7unAOnaa	lots of times<br>  the one i remembered most was in grade 10, i think<br>  me and my friend phoned a bunch of different taxi companies from the school phone all using an assumed name<br>  and 20 minutes later there were about 8 taxis parked outside our school all asking for the same person who didn't exist<br>  funniest prank call i've ever made|`|5AaV7koHaa	This takes me back a few years, but the best "prank" call is aimed at your ex. <br>  Not because you want them back, but just to crap on their day like the many times they crapped on yours.<br>  =========================<br>  It goes like this:<br>  You know he or she works nights and is currently living with some other person. So in order to put a bit of doubt in their relationship you call.<br>  My example is my ex, his name is Ed and his newest live in lady friend is Lois.<br>  While Ed is at work, you call, using your sexiest voice.<br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br>  Ring* Ring*Ring*<br>  She answers: Hello<br>  You say: Hey Hun, lemme speak to that fine hunk of a brother of yours. He makes me so hot.<br>  She says: Who?(usually there is silence, she is trying to see the caller ID/phone number, etc)<br>  You say: Oh my God, Did I dial the wrong number?<br>  (try to sound shocked and sincere) I'm trying to reach Ed Johnson, this is his number right?<br>  She says: I think you might have the wrong Johnson's.<br>  You say: Are you sure?( then you describe him and be sure you mention something on his anatomy that would be hidden by clothes)<br>  She says: How do you know him?( you will note the tiny bit of jealousy and anger in her voice.)<br>  You say: Oh, we go back a ways, he said he lives with his older invalid sister.

The best one is when we looked in the phone book for a guy with the last name of Apple.  Then we called him up and asked "Hi, is this Mr. Orange?"

LOL  That was a good one.<br>  Then one time we randomly called a number and asked for the president.  It just so happened the number we called was UIC(University of Illinois at Chicago).  The lady said "The president of the university?".  She transferred us but he wasn't in unfortunately.

It's so hilarious, because he completely 100% willing and attempting to get it on- but by the time the object of his obsession inevitably falls for him, he is already moving on and leaving for the next town, with the girl hopelessly chasing after him.|`|QJIXTpZ5aa	o.o<br>  <br>  I'll go with Shinji!
JgCGpQaxaa	Oh Gawd... It's gotta be Osaka.<br>  <br>  I mean, at least Orihime can somewhat undertand the world going on around her when she gets things explained to her slowly.  And in a dire situation she can sort of act. But Osaka is just completely out there.  Everything you try to explain to her will get warped and skewed by her abnormal outlook on life in general.<br>  <br>  <br>  That said, Osaka is also completely awesome, whereas Orihime is just facepalm inducing.|`|QJIXTpZ5aa	Osaka for sure!<br>  <br>  I mean,she hangs out with Chiyo-chan's pops for crying out loud!<br>  <br>  x)|`|toRw5MXiaa	i'll say orihime<br>  it's hard to pick|`|cLW7vFUGaa	Tough call, indeed.<br>  <br>  But since she popped into my head the second I saw the question before I even read the choices, I'm going to have to go with Osaka.<br>  <br>  I think Orihime is known for other things, but Osaka is basically famous simply for being the anime world's most complete space case.<br>  <br>  Besides, her eyes compelled me to pick her.<br>  <a href="http://content.ytmnd.com/content/d/e/e/deea7cd30909f72e275d58e990529dfa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://content.ytmnd.com/content/d/e/e/d...</a>

q4XUy0Duaa	Basically just that the industry is similar to prison in the fact that you're not free to express yourself, and you're forced to do what the label wants you to do.  The next two lines are just about the way things were back in the day, and how far from those days we are today.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  vvv Thanks!  I feel the same way too Matrix.  It's a shame that it's like that, but I feel like the fans who buy all of the garbage that major record labels feed them are also partly responsible.  If there was no market for it, it wouldn't exist.<br>  <br>  LOL, I'm all for a hip hop revolution!  Yo, great point.  I don't know why hip hop is getting pimped as bad as it is compared to other genres.  When I see people in this section posting things about the rap that I hate, I usually keep my mouth shut, because in the 80's/early 90's, I listened to a lot of commercial music too.  But like you said, the difference is that back then there was more of a variety and the commercial music was actually good, and there wasn't really a need for an underground scene.|`|gJoVBtnqaa	it means the industry is built off of capitalism|`|MSMem5qYaa	Fundamentalz got it......|`|J856emqPaa	frumdamentals knows what hes talkin bout. i feel the same way as you and him.|`|nAzEkCJsaa	i love mos def! =]<br>  & yea thats what it means. =]|`|reXfpsQgaa	^ Couldn't have said it better myself.

She could have taken the floor and done the funky chicken and I still would have voted for her, but I was really impressed at what a good job she did, esp. after only 2 days practice!|`|5LxpvXSmaa	I just think it was timing and ABC wanted to strike when the iron was hot. They placed her in such a horrible way last week and such publicity came out of it ( At one time last week it was quoted Jason was the most hated man in America,) that such a fury was created and they saw an opening where even more people who were invested in what happens to her would watch another show . It could benefit both of them in a positive light she said yes.

I'm a Capricorn too born 1985. I ask myself the same question!! I was seeing this guy & I thought things were going really well but I was wrong & it left me soo upset because I was perfectly fine living the single life, I was accepting of it. I wasn't looking for anything then all of a sudden I meet this great guy & things just didn't go how I thought they would when it seemed so promising, I was like wtf!! I believe everything happens for a reason & I just couldn't see why he was put in my path. Now I find myself wanting a boyfriend & a relationship again when I was fine with not having one before.  The best advice is be patient, we will find our prince, we just have to kiss a few toads first. I know its easier said then done because I'm in exactly your situation. I want love, I want it now, but you cant rush anything just because you want it, you have to just go with the flow & let it happen when it happens..|`|pUZh67Fqaa	Love is whenever you can feel it. You will know when love hits you. If there comes someone in your life who you feel secure and safe with, who can hold you in his arms and you can just know that he cares about you... then you'll know. Love is so powerful, and don't you worry. Love finds everybody. It just maybe takes a while. It's like playing hide and seek as a kid. Love is "IT" and its trying to find everyone... but theres that one kid thats got a really good hiding spot. Eventually "Love" will find him or her... it just takes maybe a little bit longer than the rest. You don't need to look for love... love will look for you.

LrKCLZF7aa	Are you sure about the time? I will just leave the Moon and Ascendant out because the time looks odd.<br>  <br>  Just based on your aspect I can tell a few things about you. We'll start with the Sun. You have 6 aspects to your Sun, Sextile to Uranus and Saturn, quincunx to Vesta and Parallel to Jupiter Uranus and Neptune. This means that you show more of the positive side of Capricorn and less of the negative. You are a serious person but you have a sweetness about you. You don't like to fight but if you are in one then you are the first to make peace. You are popular and fickle. And you are good looking and look young for your age. You tend to be lazy and you are ethical. <br>  <br>  There are a couple of Yods in your chart. These are symetrical shapes that involve 3 planets. I will go over that each of these could mean. <br>  <br>  The first is Sun 60 Saturn and both planets at 150 degrees to Vesta:<br>  The combination of these three means that you like serious people and choose to hang out with them in a group.<br>  <br>  The second one is Mars sextile (60 degrees) Jupiter and quincunx (150 degrees) to Chiron. Chiron is the focus. Jupiter Chiron is one of the best aspects you can have in a chart and with Mars adding to it makes it very colorful. This has played it'self out in a couple of ways at least. For on thing we have a romantic planet and a sexual planet and we have Jupiter. Since Chiron is the apex we will focus on that for a bit. Chiron rules the family, marriage, children, true love and the new age. You will find that Mars gives you energy to deal with all of these things and Jupiter, well that brings you luck and good fortune in these areas. Seems like you have it pretty good.<br>  <br>  Lots of friends and a great family. But there are other aspects that might be problematic for you. The one that is staring me in the face is the Pluto opposite Juno. Both of these are sexual planets and Juno is the most powerful of all the sexual planets. But get this. Pluto makes every planet it comes in contact with even more powerful because that is one of it's symbolisms. So you have the mostest most sexual planet for lack of a better word. But it's in opposition, it seems that it could be a problem. Juno represents sexual need and Pluto is obsession. So it seems that you are obsessed with your sexual need. You also happen to have Pluto contra parallel Juno. The effect more than doubles. What an appetite. Hard to find someone that can keep up? Or have you channeled the energy into your work? It's more than likely that you have found a way to take care of this problem. Juno also rules lies and deception and the love affair. For these reasons it's good that you are ethical for the most part. I wonder if I even want to look at your Sedna placement.<br>  <br>  The Jupiter Neptune conjunction in trine with Juno add to this picture and from it I can tell that you like long sessions. Let's see if you are u[ for a quickie as well. Yes you are. But I have to say that you far prefer long sessions.<br>  <br>  Like I said there is so much more to your chart than what I see here. I have excluded the Ascendant and the Moon. And quite a few other aspects. This is visible online so I think I'll stop here.

If it feels squishy, it is a fat or old cantaloupe, and should be placed in the garbage. Once you are certain that you have a fresh, young, attractive cantaloupe, you must dig out a hole with a diameter of exactly 2.5 inches and a depth of 6.5 inches. Now dig out another hole behind that hole that is also 6.5 inches deep, but only a half inch wide. You then drop your junk in hole #1 and make sweet, passionate love to the melon. You will then ask the cantaloupe if you can use the rear entrance. The cantaloupe will ask you for a diamond tennis bracelet. Smack the cantaloupe for asking for such absurdities, then do it anyways. Make sure you switch back to the larger hole before ejaculating. In 9 months time, you will have many more cantaloupe. <br>  <br>  Be forewarned, however, as pregnant cantaloupe are clever, and might force you to pay child support. However, cutting up the cantaloupe and serving it to your family will solve this problem.|`|uCIe4ugYaa	are you TRYING to get a cantaloupe pregnant?Because if you are, dont.

qdsVS1dDaa	Are you old? No. You are older than your friends, but a couple of months. I hope that you are also smarter, wiser, and better looking than they are. Two months is nothing in the big picture. You, at 16 1/2 years of age, are 198 months old. Your friends would be 196 months old. They are 98.9898989898989898....% your age. One percent difference. In another 100 months they will then be 99.3% your age. <br>  <br>  Right now you are 25.3% of my age.

7ebNTScOaa	Not from what I have seen.  She seems great she may be a little crabby at times but with 8 kids I would be the same way maybe even more lol.|`|B1iJTtUbaa	no one is perfect<br>  i do think that for the most part she rlly does have the kids best interests at heart|`|f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	She is a horrible wife...but you know what?  He will NEVER be able to afford to leave her, and I think she knows this!|`|cmZ5Opmuaa	only God knows. And they are "christian." so if he was cheating on her then he wouldnt be a christian would he? give me a break everyone she is a good mom and a wife. . thats why they are called "rumors" because they usually arent true|`|3BPI2nMwaa	No, she is a great mom, but a bad wife. Mean is an understatement compared to how she treats her husband.|`|PjT4lpfcaa	I hardly believe he'd get away with that.<br>  But if that's true, shame on him.
0XGWM9nUaa	i doubt that..im starting to think thats a fake site its full of drama|`|cmZ5Opmuaa	this isnt even a REAL website so guys come on now.
8yE2sYGeaa	I think I have to choose Resurrection. I have just seen the first episode and it is one twisted piece of ideas.<br>  <br>  As to saddest, I have to mention the last six episodes of Mahoromatic|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Code Geass<br>  Death Note<br>  Fullmetal Alchemist<br>  One Piece<br>  Baccano!|`|cidwIuJRaa	Oh god,it has to be *Bible Black*.I mean,that anime is just so weird.Well,alot of H-animes are,but *Bible Black* tends to take the cake.<br>  <br>  Everything's like a normal school.Then,you find out some girls made a pact with the devil that involves sexual things.And,so then,you find out the teacher used to be a part of the cult that had done this in a generation before.Then,they have to make a human sacrifice in some of the grossest ways imaginable.And,the woman in charge is a futanari,and later the best friend becomes a futa as well.......<br>  <br>  Well,I am telling you that everything about that anime is just too crazy!|`|cLW7vFUGaa	Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Period. Twisted plot, twisted people, twisted everything. The 26 episodes of the first season are divided into six story arcs in which there is a new murder and/or a new murderer every time. It's like, you think you know a character... and then BAM. Something happens with a knife. Or a fingernail-chopper. Or a bill-hook cleaver. I mean, they couldn't just stick with knives!?<br>  <br>  School Days comes pretty close, and even though the one major twist is at the end, the whole thing is twisted enough to be called, well, you know, twisted...|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Gantz is one of the most twisted anime i have ever seen. I was getting use to all the main characters and then they all die at the end. Also School days when the girl started making out with the decapitated head is just nasty. There's just too many good twisted ones.|`|bZsF1n0zaa	Elfen Lied for sure it's very tiwsted in a gory way...<br>  <br>  For the non gory but has great twists I have to say:<br>  <br>  - Death Note!<br>  <br>  - One Piece! (My favorite!!!)<br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|fKcr6KU0aa	Narutaru.  The twist in the end was the worst part, but the rest got progressively more twisted as it went.   Started out carefree and happy with a cute little Pokemon-like creature and a young girl, then got more and more ominous and tense and violent, and then you're like WTF??!?<br>  <br>  And the sheer deceptiveness of the opening sequence and first episode (and the fact that it aired on "Kids Station" in Japan) was a work of genius.  I mean.  Those who have seen it.  WTH is with this OP, amirite? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIF5BLyh3Mk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIF5BLyh3...</a><br>  <br>  At 1:08:  Notice those girls carrying the other girl away?  THAT IS NOT CUTE.  (Also, read the Youtube comments if you're bored.  They're really kind of awesome.)<br>  <br>  It's been years, and I can't bring myself to rewatch it.  I just can't.  I've seen Higurashi all the way through.  Narutaru is a lot worse by the end.<br>  <br>  The manga goes on much longer (haven't read that, either).  I suspect that the anime was canceled due to controversy over the last couple of eps, though I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  (Haven't seen Elfen Lied yet, though, so this may change when I do.)|`|UTumb3Ssaa	If you mean gory, sick and twisted, then I have to go with Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. There are also a lot of crazy things happening and the plot may be confusing at first, but if you continue watching, then you will understand. I would recommend watching this.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Death Note. It's really unpredictable. Just when you think, "AHA! This is gonna happen!" Then boom. You get a totally different twist that makes you realize that you got it wrong. It keeps you guessing. And the ending is also quite a stunner.|`|d7j9Wbbhaa	The most twisted scene in R2, for me, was when Shirley died. Lelouch just went through tons of crap to save her, then Rolo goes and kills her. My first thought?<br>  <br>  "FFFFFFFFUUUUU---"|`|fpVmFrYKaa	Death Note's the most twisted anime ever! It has some plots where you can never think of whats going to happen next if you watched it for the first time.

uD1S5dYtaa	Along with the possibility of harmonious signs, there are traits of each partner that need to be worked through.  Since you are both Cardinal signs,  you each want to be the decider, the leader.  So knowing that, if you have your charts done, you could divide the decisions by who is stronger in each house of responsibility.  Likewise with socializing- she likes to go out, you like to snuggle.  Compromises need to be worked out.  Astrology doesn't say DON"T DO THAT, it says here's the most comfortable match.  But if you want something else, here are the challenges you'll need to face and work on.|`|iXslnkAZaa	If you both are in love, that is all that matters. Astrologically, you might have personal planets in signs which are harmonious. For example, maybe you have Mercury in Gemini, or perhaps she has Venus in Scorpio. Those are just two examples.

7Tebk9bzaa	Usually if a band is opening for another they usually play q whole set. they may not play as much as the headliner band but they will still play quite a few songs, maybe six to eight songs.

Wait until Paramore come back when tickets are $20.
9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	For me, Grainger was one of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century. His folksong arrangements show such imagination that he brings them to colourful life far beyond the originals. He also wrote original pieces that sound just like folksongs but aren't (eg 'Country Gardens' - although based on an old folk melody, the actual tune of 'Country Gardens' only exists in the form we know it in Grainger's masterful little miniature).<br>  <br>  He also wrote two works which I consider supreme genius: 'Green Bushes: Passacaglia on an English Folk Tune' and the 'music to an imaginary ballet' called 'The Warriors'.<br>  <br>  He was also one of the oddest men to have walked the planet. He indulged in self-flagellation, raced against galloping horses (he was very athletic, but that's ridiculous!) and had the walls of his and his wife's bedroom lined with mirrors and cameras so that all their 'activities' could be self-observed and filmed. He was also a rabid Anglo-Saxon supremacist. His music ONLY includes directions and tempo markings in Anglo-Saxon English and never Italian (or any other 'Latin' languages). He would never use English words like 'commence', 'colour' which had a Latin or Romance language origin - he would only use words of an Anglo-Saxon or Germanic origin (such as 'begin' or 'tint').<br>  <br>  As others have said, he was one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century.|`|19YfKNpJaa	I only know Grainger's band music (well), but it's spectacular stuff.  Lincolnshire is one of the finest pieces ever written for wind ensemble.  Contrary to one poster, I actually find Grainger's orchestration to be generally well thought-out and creative.  But it's often tough to determine what orchestrations are his, since many, MANY of his works exist in versions for multiple types of ensembles, some of which were done by PAG, and some of which were done by other people.<br>  <br>  Here's a fantastic list:<br>  <a href="http://www.bardic-music.com/pgcat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bardic-music.com/pgcat.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You might want to check out some others:<br>  Australian Up-Country Song<br>  Country Gardens<br>  Green Bushes<br>  Handel in the Strand (one of my favorites)<br>  In a Nutshell<br>  Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol<br>  Ye Banks & Braes o’ Bonnie Doon|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	In common with other answers I do like the music of Percy Grainger. As my middle name is 'Daniel' I suppose I have to have a soft spot for the Irish Tune from County Derry!<br>  <br>  An anecdote if I may. Many years ago (more now than I care to remember) I was brought up in Harrow, Middlesex, whose education came under the then County of Middlesex(RIP) which had an enlightened policy on music education. At least once a year. and possibly more frequently, orchestral concerts for local schools were held in a local cinema. These were given by the Sinfonia of London under Muir Matheson. In one such concert a work by Grainger was to be performed. However, when the time for its performance arrived, the conductor turned to the audience and said 'I'm very sorry children, but we cannot play the next advertised piece as we appear to have lost Handel in the Strand!|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Lovely music; He was a bit of a boy though, wasn't he ?|`|1204e9a4f0121ebac48e7d8f61d56242aa	Absolutely wonderful music. Lincolnshire is a fascinating piece of music, parts are a real challenge to conduct and to play. The Irish Tune is a beautiful arrangement. One of the most difficult performances I ever participated in was playing Irish Tune in concert shortly after the assassination of then President John F. Kennedy - not a dry eye in the audience or on stage!<br>  <br>  The other thing I remember about Grainger's music are all the funny directions and comments he put throughout the conductor's scores.<br>  <br>  Musician, composer, teacher.|`|AA11998997	I love his version of The Waltz of the Flowers..<br>  Just wait, people..I know "hafwen" will soon come here and write about her hero Percy Grainger! (I mean "one" of them!)|`|jbAr62ybaa	I personally loved some of his music.  Sadly, you rarely ever hear it nowadays.<br>  <br>       Will have to look him up on You Tube: see if there's anything by him on there.<br>  <br>                                           Thanks for your question,<br>  <br>                                                        Alberich|`|dpYMlxA4aa	I've always loved him as a performer and a folk song collector. Some people forget that he was one of the finest pianist of his day. Though I've never cared for his compositions. I've always found the orchestration to be a little awkward.

wsCBo2Zkaa	Low ratings. Sign all the petitions to save the show otherwise the last episode will not be good cos they don;t have time to truly end all the ongoing stirylines!!! Lisa Michelle x x lol x x|`|AA11404443	I heard that ABC Family wanted to go in a different direction with their programing so they canceled Kyle XY. It was not because of ratings, it still did well, they just don't want to make the show anymore. It was the only show I watched on that channel and I will miss it when it's gone.<br>  <br>  Edit: From TV Guide Feb 16- March 1<br>  <br>  Once ABC Family's highest-rated original series, Kyle XY will be no more after season 3's March 13 finale. "Our fan base has been pretty consistent," says coexecutive probucer Julie Plec. "But I understand the network went in a new creative direction with The Secret Life of the American Teenager, which has been a magnificent success for them." Although disappointed that she won't have the chance to pen a series finale, Plec promises the previously shot season ender will have "good relationship and mythology explanations. It ties the whole series together." There's one caveat: "If you don't want a cliff-hanger that blows the whole thing open, don't watch the last 20 seconds!" There's also the posibility of a series wrap-up. "We have an international fan base," says Plec. "I'm hoping for a DVD movie."|`|8ngDDwhVaa	Lower ratings. Everybody who loves KYLE XY!

1640VigBaa	It depends on if you mean composing in the classical sense or the modern sense. If you mean the classical sense, than I would start with a simple melody, and then add the appropriate harmonization with chords. If you mean the modern sense, then I would mess around with your instrument and play these chords until you find the right progression for the sound you are looking for; C major, d minor, e minor, F major, G major, a minor, b minor. I personally like the progression C major- G major- d minor- a minor. After you get the progression of chords you like, start writing lyrics and singing them so that they fit into the chord progressions. That is how I go about it, even if I already have the lyrics written down. The first person to comment is right though, composing is a lot more complex than just doing it. If you need more help, feel free to email me. tcarmona0@rocketmail.com  <br>  I will do the best I can to teach the essentials. Oh, and the last thing you want to do is force a song out... it just gets messy. You have to let it flow.|`|4b43c7862d487241c3bd40512accab77aa	That is a much bigger and deeper question than you realize! But, you can start by writing your lyrics down. Then if you play an instrument start chording. Next, start singing or humming with you lyrics in mind while following a simple chord progression in this case something like C F C G7 C. You will want to do several measures not just one. You wont have to worry about sharps and flats as this is C major and does not have any.<br>  Finally, you may wish to (or not) substitute the C in one or two measures with Am. This is a simple and effective way to begin writing songs. Years can be spent in song writing as the complexities can be enormous. Good luck!

5TDCswaaaa	because of scheduling, if they kept showing new episodes without taking a break the season would end too early. the reason the spoiler u saw might have said that a new episode would air march 9th was because originally they were gonna have an episode called blair waldorf's day off air on the 9th. now they are airing an episode called the age of dissonance on the 16th.|`|TRGuyBlzaa	Just find a site have all Gossip Girl episodes online<br>  <a href="http://mediarefer.com/gossip-girl/" rel="nofollow">http://mediarefer.com/gossip-girl/</a>|`|T6lpeUDKaa	They're having a 6 week hiatus.

But it's from the same makers of 7th Heaven and that went through I think 10 seasons.

He will have to put up George or Danielle. That will leave him with no where to turn, exposed next week, no Coup d'Etat. It will be sink or swim time for him. Will has to have figured out the Erika scam. Danielle has to know that Jannelle is her best chance to keep in the house, as does James.  Whoever survives this week is sure to put him up on the block .|`|AA11711450	Janelle and James went on the block. Janelle won the Veto. Don't know who went up in Janelle's place yet

I would get a roaring fire going in the fireplace, then I would prepare your favorite dish for you with your favorite type of music playing in the background.  After enjoying a nice candle-lit dinner, we would movie to the big comfy couch to watch your favorite movie as the glow of the fire place keeps us warm.<br>  <br>  OK, I figured out the first part of the date, it is totally up to you as to where things go from there.....

If it went well I would suggest we go out again.<br>  The second date would probably start with going to a movie we would both like to see, then we would go to resturaunt/lounge & have few drinks, if we were having a good time,  I would make a suggestion that we go out to a bar or club & have some fun,where we go from there I'd leave up to you.|`|C00Bd6eZaa	McDonalds....

a98ec4eed4ea0396f04f338033baf203aa	I don't know much but I do know iPods are way overrated and tend to be pricey.  iTunes is ok I guess but it does have its quirks (like anything else).  Had an iPod shuffle for about 2 weeks but the update fried it and Apple was not helpful in replacing it.  From research I found this to be a common theme.  Returned it for a Creative Zen Nano.  Not as stylish (if it's in my pocket what's the point of style?).  Had it for about 8 months now and I like it fine.  Also was told by a computer geek that Creative was the first to start mp3's anyway so why not go with their stuff and not a rip-off?  Oh, my zen is very plug and play.  Just insert into usb and it opens window to copy songs into.  Hope this helps.|`|d62c2ffbe6d4caa3f13f3b0434404455aa	U CAN GET A MEMRO-X IT HOLD SONG BUT U WOULD HAVE TO BUY A MEMORY CARD THEN IT WOULD HOLD AS MANY SONGS AS U HAVE BOUGHT ON UR MEMORY CARD SO YES|`|AA10583102	an iPod shuffle or iPod nano may be what you're looking for.  with the iPod shuffle it's as easy as importing your songs into iTunes (the program comes with your iPod), plug it into the USB port, and it should automatically load your songs onto the music player.  Also, iPod nanos hold about 1,000 songs and shuffles hold about 500.

He was also<br>  plagued by "Lead poisoning" and his physical life deteriorated to a degree that he went deaf and in his despair...withdrew from society and grieved of the thought of dying alone.  He was a very special person.  He didn't realize how great he would be.

AA11349072	Are you going to analyze?? If so, I've got one that'll give you nightmares!<br>  <br>  K. I had this dream years ago and it scared the hell out of me! I was in this huge, beautiful house with windows from the marble floor to the 24 ft. ceilings. I lived there with a few roommates but they were out for the night. It was dark out and the only light I had on was the television. Sitting on the sofa, I saw a glimmer of light in the sky out of the window about twenty ft. to my left. I knew it wasn't a star by the brightness, but I couldn't figure out what it was. I stood up and walked over to the window. The bright light grew bigger as if it were coming toward me quickly, but it was obviously many miles away. <br>  <br>  I kept watch and after about 90 seconds, I realized that it was heading right for my house! I panicked and couldn't figure out where to go due to the fact that I couldn't estimate its size. All the sudden, SMASH!!! Huge explosion! My natural reaction was to get on the floor and cover my head. When I realized that I was still alive, I looked up.<br>  <br>  It was a fighter jet and it was lodged into the walls of the corridor. I couldn't believe it! Dry wall was everywhere, the smoke was blinding and sticking to my throat, but I had to investigate. <br>  <br>  I slowly walked over to the craft and I remember ducking under it and when I came out on the opposite side, in my periferal vision, was the pilot. He too was lodged in the wall, dead. I refused to look at him, so I just tried to keep moving down the hall, but as I passed him, his helmet fell onto my head. I flipped out! I threw the helmet off of me, completely grossed out, and then as I ran my fingers through my hair, I felt something. I pulled from my hair, a chunk of bloody flesh from the pilots scalp. Again, I freaked!<br>  <br>  What made me gain my composure was this extremely bright, white light consuming a window at the end of this hallway. I slowly approached it, with a lot of apprehension and then all the sudden, a figure appeared. It was a girl sitting indian-style on the window sill. The white light behind her made her look angelic, not to mention the fact that she was wearing white! Finally, I recognized her. Her name was Monique, and she had been a friend of mine in highschool. We lost contact after she became involved with an abusive boyfriend. It had been many years since I had seen her. Anyway, she's sitting in the window with all this white light around her, and she asks me to come closer to her. I refused. I just had a bad feeling about it. Really hesitant and scared like if I go, I may not come back! That's when I woke up.|`|c49fd7b787b4f2ee03e5b62ffcfaadafaa	It's a falling dream.  I fell from a building, hit the ground, everything goes black, then I'm surrounded with bright white light, but it doesn't hurt my eyes.

He is not a completley horrible actor but I dont think he is every original or different in his movies. His voice is always the same he uses the same expression, and that really does not change in this movie becuase his character's alter ego is animated. Johnny Depp always brings something new to his characters like Willy Wonka, or Jack Sparrow. Nicholas Cage should not have been cast for this role. His best movie by far was Gone in 60 Seconds, he should have stopped after that.

0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	Have you ever thought of renting both and comparing the storytelling and characterizations?<br>  <br>  Character actor Lew Ayres played the role of Paul Baumer in the 1903 version, while Richard Thomas, who became famous in the role of John-Boy Walton, played the same role in the TV-Movie version in 1979. <br>  <br>  You could watch both movies and compare how each one portrayed the character. What each one brought to the role.|`|AA12201622	I prefer the original also it  won and academy award, It was suppose to show what happens to and entire high school class room. of young men the other one if you like the guy that played john boy on the Walton's is in that one..<br>  <br>  Also everyone can give me a thumbs down if you want, But I hate remakes of Classic movies..|`|0ecf46ba127e16ff861441f120c131b1aa	Why not watch them both?|`|4aabc737308400fa35ece8b0676305afaa	yeah watch both

They are very good stories based on Vampires (kinda) and shapeshifters.  They do have some pretty graphic sex scenes if you are old enough, but some pretty great wit as well.  Look up dark-hunter.com and you can get a little more info.<br>  <br>  TV-<br>  You can check out Forever Knight on DVD, its a late 80s tv show about a vampire cop, same with Moonlight (and that guy is hot) that was on last year.   True Blood on Showtime.<br>  <br>  Movies-<br>  the Underworld movies with Kate Beckinsale are good ones

IMSkR8Ajaa	For a decent mandolin, you should get an hand carve solid top mandolin and preferably the same for the sides. If you don't care about looks (as far as f-style or a-style) you should go with an A-style mandolin as you will get more bang for your buck. It is good that you are coming from a fiddle (violin:) because the fiddle and mando have the same tuning (EADG). I would recommend a Kentucky brand a-style mandolin like one of these: <a href="http://www.janetdavismusic.com/kmand.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.janetdavismusic.com/kmand.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Mandolins that just say "solid spruce top" are just laminate and will not have as good of tone or volume as the "hand carved solid tops." Mandolins are fairly expensive. Janet Davis music is a good place to get it from if you can not go and actually hold and play one at a music store. Make sure you get a good setup for your mando. JDM does that as well as Mandolin Hut and The Mandolin Store for online dealers. Elderly is also another good online dealer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!<br>  <br>  If you need any more help, drop by the forums at www.mandolincafe.com

1adc0d23a86054cfca834f91a6059175aa	ooh. me too! me too! I wanna act on disney channel! heh heh. you may wanna get an acting agent, one with a good background, who'll manage you, and call you up on auditions, and roles that need kids like you. start small join the drama club, and participate in school plays( if you aren't already), to build up your experience. don't feel bad if you don't get on DC as fast as you want. it takes years to have a career like Raven's or Hilary's, but you'll make it if you're really determined. Good luck, and don't forget the little people (*cough *cough Me) who gave you the advice on how to get your big break when you're on Disney Channel!|`|542c6d83012d6659c943443caf85e2b6aa	eat a doggy!|`|AA11877191	uum get an agent an have no talent wat so ever then u will be a super star on disney

They wish that America would be left to them and all the other races/religions would leave.  Basically it is people that have never learned that diversity is the spice of life.  It really is sad that we still have groups like this left.|`|AA10933669	Ku Klux Klan-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkk" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkk</a>|`|1961f3316bcbb529511a53864836b732aa	Are you serious, everyone knows.

They even try to kill Jews and blacks sometimes.|`|f1cb0b0feedcff76a42dca51d1581114aa	The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) refers to a number of past and present fraternal organizations in the United States that have advocated white supremacy, anti-Semitism, racism, anti-Catholicism, homophobia, and nativism. These organizations have often used terrorism, violence and acts of intimidation such as cross burning to oppress African Americans and others.

e8cf170b2bc74dee2be1b216cc5740d8aa	Tout d'abord, une petite correction par rapport à l'intervention d'Igene, la coupe du mond de Quidditch est présente au début de HP, tu devrais revisionner le film car même si la scène ne dure pas aussi longtemps que dans le livre, elle est visuellement énorme!!!<br>  En ce qui concerne mes attentes sur David Yates ( le réalisateur de l'Ordre du Phénix), j'espère qu'il conservera l'atmosphère énervante et stressante du livre car c'est comme ?a que cet opus est génial. Ensuite, j'espère que (attention Spoiler) la mort d'un certain personnage sera plus claire (sans trop l'être toutefois) à l'écran. Vivement sa sortie, le teaser m'a déjà mis en appétit!!!|`|47d4216be95f6b33c39c6afa745de9cbaa	un peu de retenue ! les acteurs sont majeurs je pense donc ?a doit les titiller mais ce n'est pas à l'ordre du jour donc pas de sexe !!!|`|6c910ec6f9b8400b945f409acbfc4ba8aa	rien de special!<br>   le film ne vaudra jamais le film, c'est juste pur le business!|`|731b7ffb5c77e7ef1ac734d39fecee3faa	rien ,car je n'ai pas lu les livres ni vu les films précédants .|`|74589ee859a7f98b3defe4d3acc665d8aa	toujours trop, évidemment !<br>  le réalisateur ne pourra jamais rendre le film comme le livre l'est, a fortiori quand on avance dans les tomes...<br>  les livres sont de plus en plus fournis, les intrigues plus complexes, les sentiments plus nuancés... ce n'est pas possible de faire un film sans perdre 70 % du contenu du bouquin.<br>  Vu le teaser, il a l'air de s'être centré sur l'affrontement Harry/Voldemort, c'est un  choix un peu trop manichéen pour respecter l'esprit du bouquin à mon go?t...<br>  Mais ils n'ont pas le choix, ou alors de faire plusieurs films sur un livre ! Mais ils y perdraient en rythme !! <br>  En tout cas, il a d? bien se prendre la tête ! Je vais forcément être dé?ue, je m'y attends, mais j'irais par curiosité, car j'ai beaucoup aimé le bouquin et j'attends de voir comment vont être représenté les personnages, les scènes...|`|8f75a8615b931b10360aafb9080fc9f9aa	Qu'il respecte le plus possible l'esprit du livre!|`|e81ebb5165629ac68142388248aa395eaa	de ne pas changer le style de garder tous les bonnes choses qui font la magie du film( normalement le film devait durer 3h alors il s ont decidés d enlever les scenes de quidditch)|`|f93dbdf18e3e68e62235ad2ae29d6be1aa	qu'il soit un peu plus fidèle au livre. j'ai adoré le 3ème, mais j'étais dé?ue par le 4ème, beaucoup de scènes ne collent pas avec l'oeuvre.|`|180ed9f734c6fb379e9c8142228cd080aa	absolument rien...<br>  mais alors rien de rien...|`|739c17019a05e40415719c34f5f78a3caa	Qu'il arrête!|`|6d0e16b3835ecd7b93d9aafc65a9f439aa	j'espère juste qu'il sera bien <br>  le livre 4 était tellement bien et le film 4 tellement nul<br>  j'espère que là ce sera différent|`|81e7247c997236b82260728bc24c0114aa	Déjà, le respect du livre original.<br>  Après, j'ai bien aimé les adaptations du 3 et du 4.<br>  Avec une préférence pour l'ambiance plus glauque du 3 et le regret de l'absence du match de coupe du monde de quiddtich au début du 4.<br>  Qu'on grandisse avec Potter...|`|d6e1c2eb9ceecc6d0df65f9b114f3965aa	Je souhaite que le film colle le plus possible au livre, j'ai toujours été un peu dé?ue par les films sauf le 3ème.

John fut le plus jeune président élue) de l'histoire des USA, il permit aux noirs du sud d'aller à la faculté qui était alors réservée qu'aux blancs, il se rapprocha de Kroutchev en pleine guerre froide, mais il fut assassiné à Dallas le 22 novembre 63. Son frère, Robert, au visage à la robert Redfort, brigua le fauteuil suprême, mais le 5 juin 68, en pleine campagne électorale que l'on pensait gagnante,  fut abattu à Los Angeles, ce qui permit à Nixon d'etre président.....<br>  <br>  Les Kennedy avaient apportés au monde une autre forme de politique, ils se sont battus pour les noirs, pour toutes les minorités, ils étaient jeunes, en une époque où tous les chefs d'état avaient dépassé les 70  ans, ils étaient beaux, ils incarnaient une certaine amérique, jeune, belle, sportive, et qui réussissait............malheureusement le destin a été très lourd..parmi les 9 enfants, 2 sont décédés en avion, 2 assassinés, et l'ainé des filles malade mentale, quant à la deuxième génération, elle n'a pas été épargnée, le fils de JFK (le président) est mort dans un accident d'avion avec sa femme et sa belle soeur.<br>   2 fils de Robert sont décédés l'un à 29 ans d'une over dose, l'autre à 39 lors d'un accident de ski un 31 décembre..........<br>  <br>  Quant à Edward Kennedy (frère de Joe, john et Robert) sur ses 3 enfants, l'un a 12 ans a été amputé d'une jambe pour cause de cancer, et sa fille à 39 ans a eu un cancer des poumons).<br>  <br>  Mais pour terminer, oui les Kennedy ont donné au monde, une autre image de la politique, une image plus jeune, plus brillante, plus belle, et surtout plus humaine|`|b80e8c9104722a7d783603a6ac926e1aaa	Bill Clinton.<br>  On aura beau dire, mais il "manque" au monde.

bOH5M8cCaa	Approaching the time that the group was ready to deliver their second album, Naturi Naughton announced that she was no longer a member of the group. Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management, which led to a heated argument in August 2002 involving an altercation with KFC food. Not long after, Naughton claimed she was forced out of the group.<br>  <br>  Williams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the "3LW" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as "2LW".The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of Sister 2 Sister magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. A Girl Can Mack's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing. Jessica Benson joined the group shortly after, replacing Naturi.<br>  <br>  The trio's third album, Point of No Return had its release pushed back from Summer 2006 to an unknown date. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Benson on her Myspace in January 2008. Benson confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded, quoting "too much drama" for the reason. Benson added that she is in a new band called Chocolate. 3LW has also been removed from its label's roster.<br>  <br>  In 2005, Bailon and Williams joined The Cheetah Girls, which disbanded in 2009 with the girls (Bailon, Williams, and Sabrina Bryan) all wanting to focus on other projects. Bailon announced she is working on her debut solo album, due for a September 2009 release. The single is rumored to feature rapper Jay-Z. Bryan is working on an advice book, however the release date is unknown. In 2008, Williams released a song titled "Make Me A Drink" that failed to do successfully but is still working on a solo album as well as focusing on her acting career. In January 2009, she landed a role in the film The Science of Cool.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	They split up because of fights.<br>   All I remember is they were fighting and one girl threw spaghetti in another girls do'|`|AA10652430	Cheetah Girls<br>  3LW had some kinda beef with Naturi I believe, so she left and now the remaining two are/were doing Cheetah Girls movies (Adrienne Bailon and Kiely Williams).

ak610Npjaa	stay away from the taurus!!!! he will only frustrate you and you will only frustrate him. run while you can you will regret it if you dnt|`|QZzQdh43aa	There's a mutual fascination between Taurus and Aquarius because they're so different. Aquarius seeks trends, and has one eye on the future, while Taurus can be set in their ways. The quickchanging Aquarius upsets the stability-seeking nature of Taurus. Taurus may seem rigid, narrow-minded to the Aquarian sensibility. Taurus wants to own lots of nice material things, while Aquarius is more apt to seek intellectual property.<br>  <br>  Taurus wants to get down and dirty in the sack, and Aquarius stays a bit aloof, detached during the act. The uncatchable Aquarius sets off jealousy for the Bull, especially if they're just one of the gang. Aquarius is one beat removed, even from intimates, and this creates an intolerable gap for the possessive Taurus. Both are stubborn and may quickly find a trivial matter turning them into adversaries.<br>  Fixed signs are drawn to eachother, and with other compatible planets, this match has potential for longterm harmony. Taurus is good with practical matters, and this is good for Aquarius, who struggles with earthly matters. Taurus may find Aquarius too idea oriented, and be unnerved by the off the wall thought patterns of the Waterbearer. Taurus loves tradition, while Aquarius shirks the status quo, opting for the innovations of the future. Aquarius resists merging and can live in the mind, while Taurus renews itself through physical intimacy and sensual pleasures. On the up side, Taurus can manage the day-to-day, and Aquarius comes up with the big picture plan. If they can handle the gulf that naturally exists here, it might work.

So, she dropped out. I wish she hadn't But, I guess it made her the good person she is today.

9DIpVPl1aa	wait... your throwing a funeral for a dead fish... what is wrong with the world... i grew up with gold fish from the fair. i got lucky one year and the 4 that i won lasted longer than expected. 2 died after about a year, one lived til it was about 6 years (i named it big city cause it was BIG, and then it died a week later) and then the last one lived 10 years (i named it tails after the sonic character since it was close to a yellow and it had 2 separate tails... and then it died a month later). moral to the story, if you get lucky with state fair gold fish... dont name then, they'll die! but every year i went back and got new gold fish. and everytime they would die, i (by myself) would net them out and flush them down the toilet. now it was a big deal with tails and big city cause of how long they lasted but a betta? come on now (you can use my story if you like :P)

How can wolverine win.<br>  <br>  Spiderwoman- forget the rest of her powers (bio stings, etc.) her pheremones can and have controlled wolverine before.  They controlled the wrecker who put some serious beating on wolverine until she got involved.<br>  <br>  Carol Danvers- she is a cosmic superhero. super strong and invulnerable. Rouge stole her powers for a time.<br>  <br>  Captain America? Possibly, he is a much better fighter than wolverine, and stronger. If we go by the old kirby/lee version wolverine doesn't have  a chance though because he always won that was the point of the old captain america.<br>  <br>  Iron Man and sentry- what a joke, the question wouldn't be who would win, but a contest between these two for who could beat wolverine quicker. <br>  <br>  Tony Stark without armor - considering he was trained to fight by captain america hand to hand, and did give cap a good fight recently without armor, AND has a healing factor like wolverine's because of the extremis, wolverine may be able to beat him, either that or they just pound on each other for eternity instantly healing thier respective wounds as soon as they are made.|`|045b8872c9188a5776d1b2bf8036d110aa	silver surfer, just need to drag wolverine out from the planet of earth and let him die in the outter space without oxigen|`|2f18e7d40c41f8cdab4604f40f0fbaa8aa	Superman since nothing can kill him except Krystal's which Wolverine doesn't have|`|AA10058555	Any number of heroes.

Seriously though, there was a very lopsided battle between DC and Marvel heroes, with the readership voting on the outcome. In a fight between Wolverine and Lobo, Wolverine won. <br>  <br>  This is an implausible outcome as Lobo could be cut in half, and both halves would still be fighting. Lobo's healing factor outweighs Wolverine's by a long chalk.|`|367dbb436adbc11c08862feb98f3788aaa	Magneto since he can control Wolverine

CHRISTIAN BALE IS A BEAST WHEN IT COMES TO PLAYING BATMAN.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	no. absolutely it will NOT happen. its just some rumor some idiot made up. there is no way on earth that they would replace the lead actor in the follow up to the 2nd highest grossing movie in history. you know how many people would NOT go see that movie and how much money they would lose??? and dont you think they have learned their lesson from the last batman series having 3 batmans? christian bale IS batman. no question. if he wants 50 million to play him again, then you give it to him. i WILL NOT go see a new batman if they recast it. and batman is my fav superhero.<br>  this all started over his "rant" on the set of terminator 4 and someone trying to say he's a diva and the studio doesnt want him for the next batman. yeah right. lets get rid of the guy that helped us make a half a BILLION dollars. i dont think so kids. its a stupid man who would make that decision.<br>  trust me kids, it aint gonna happen.|`|7d4cba081658a3d983af242ee5c7b43daa	Hope not, it depends if Christopher Nolan returns to direct the next film, if he doesn't then Bale said he wouldn't want to reprise his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	This question is getting on my nerves as it has already been asked, christian bale is on contract for at least one or two more batman movies, the rumors are false.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	NOOO!!

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I have been a part of 3 bands and the important thing right now is to play together and get used to your styles.  See what type of music you are going to do, and what the sound is like.<br>  <br>  Also learn some covers (if you play a show nobody gives a crap about your music- they will want some stuff they know and sing to etc. so give it to them).<br>  <br>  Practice- you need to have a set schedule and don't deviate from it.  We played every Friday night from 7-12pm without fail.  <br>  <br>  Put some stuff on a cd when you sound good and start playing some open mic nights...word will get around if you are any good.  You need to promote yourself as well so get out there and talk to club owners etc.<br>  <br>  Finally have fun- being in a band is one of the coolest things you can ever do, and I have some of my greatest memories from it.|`|3a2063f47e563461d790d63db29d4361aa	Try to learn your instruments first :O|`|8b498eba16cc4fa2d969d3f92604797daa	excuse me, you can't plan to make a good band, ur either good or ur not, screw books, its about the music man, its the rock, if u can't play don't try save urself some embarassment|`|c0f87fdae85b8028f31bf355db844fd3aa	www.myspace.com<br>  <br>  www.purevolume.com<br>  <br>  Good luck

Your midhaven is what you strive to be or what line of work you could possible do the best in.  Like, if it was gemini, it would be a gemini type job, like writing, communicating with the public in some form.  That's pretty basic.  To really know, have your chart read by a professional.  Because it could have some bad angles.|`|AA10746164	Hello fellow Virgo! What you can do is make goals for yourself.  Set standards. This is what I do.

12QJ9QMRaa	Wow.....<br>  <br>  that sounds like the type of Obnoxious Rule that the lords of all things acceptable and non poser that reside int his section would enforce.<br>  <br>  Honestly...who cares how popular a song is if you like it? If a Metallica Fan love Enter Sandman... how is that my business.<br>  <br>  Now if that was the only song he KNEW form them...well, that might not look so good.|`|utTFiz3gaa	I think its like that because sometimes that song that holds the title to "THEE MOST POPULAR SONG OF *please insert band/artist here* gets extremely annoying and played out.. and it annoys the fans of the artist (well those who have been listening to them for a long time i would think) because you hear all these people saying "i LOVE this song!" and don't listen to any other song by the artist ever again.. i'm sorry i'm in ranting mode now because i hate it when people do that! I don't think its a rule or anything i love Bulls on Parade even if everyone associates rage with it (or killing in the name one or the other) but i have to say its not my fav rage song :D So its okay to love your favorite band's most popular song.. it doesn't make you any less of a die hard fan as long as you know more songs by the band :)<br>  <br>  I just dont like seeing other people treat music like a piece of bubble gum its like you only listen to top 40 and download a guy's most popular song and may be missing out on such great beauty... Sometimes.. and most of the time the best song is not the single hint hint ;D|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Hellz nah....haha....<br>  <br>  Perfect example....My favorite song in the whole wide world is "Stabbing the Drama" by Soilwork.....yet it is one of their more well-known songs....but still I am a total Soilwork fangirl, mega-fan, have all their stuff,etc, etc,etc....They are my favorite band and nah, my favorite song by them is not a lesser known song.....<br>  <br>  :)|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	No. That's stupid.<br>  My favorite Hole song is Miss World, that it is one of their most popular songs. <br>  It doesn't make you any less of a fan.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	It can seem that way, can't it? Fans that are really into being fans are funny. My answer is of course no, but I do have some thoughts as to why it seems that way. <br>  <br>  I do think that with some bands the singles can end up feeling like the welcome mat and those songs play themselves out a little quicker because they are out in front. The more accessible material. I also think that in some cases the deeper cuts feel like more chances have been taken and can pay off for it. Of course this is just some bands. Then there is just the fact that sometimes the singles are the best songs for marketing, but not the best songs.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I don't really end up picking favorite songs, but for some of my favorite bands I have popular favorites. One of my top 5 Pavement songs is Gold Soundz which was a single for instance. I've never seen it as some sort of a rule, though I do see where you're coming from in asking the question as far as unwritten rules go (I've never been too into rules or procedure in fandom so I may not be the right person to answer), but I actually would say it would have more to do with the singles being played a lot getting into a band and thus playing themselves out, opening the door for the deeper cuts to become favorites.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	i wouldnt say that exactly... but you have to be familiar with the deep cuts and be able to talk about them too. still, that kind of is the code: pick a couple of the "other" songs to let people know that you actually follow the band and dont just casually like them from the radio.|`|sHWh47jFaa	No, you just have to like a lot of other songs by them too. Its ok for you to like your favorite band's most popular song, its most likely their most popular one because its their best one.|`|r4xKaZ37aa	Hell no. <br>  Obnoxious rule. <br>  Who makes up this crap??<br>  Is it MTV?? Damn you MTV!!|`|ebxwADDcaa	not really. but that usualy is what happens to me anyway.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You don't have to.  But, in the circles which care about such things, not picking at least one obscure track would ID you as a bandwagon-jumper.|`|NegtUpNcaa	Ummm no....<br>  <br>  First off, who really cares who is your favorite band but you? <br>  Second, only "hardcore" posers are like that.

Keep Reading.<br>  How did the first humans become human? From an ancestor that slowly after consist rebirth and natural selection become human. So lets see, the ancestor is 99.7% human. Natural selection and giving birth to the stronger would slowly narrow it down to 99.99, then more to 99.9999999, then finallyyyy 100%. So imagine this situation with a chicken and an egg. Ancestor that is 99.7% chicken, after many generations would slowly become more toward 100% chicken. So when it hits that final ancestor, that is 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999... chicken, it would lay an egg, and that egg would hatch into an 100% chicken.

kAvgkLxPaa	If you want something that's literally a killer, you can try the Queen of the Night Aria. It's got F6s repeatedly, and just pretty much stays above the treble stave most of the time.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it's better to sing something that you're good at and sound good, rather than screech out something that you obviously can't sing. It's not the difficulty of the song that would impress, it's how well you sing it. You can do an easier song and still blow people away. Personally, I would rather listen to someone sing something that sits well in their voice and which they can handle comfortably, than hear someone butchering a tough aria 'just because it's difficult'.|`|4lTsTliJaa	the queen of the night aria.|`|SGcNzxeHaa	Love U For Life-JoDeCi|`|UKtRES03aa	halo by beyonce.|`|AA10261517	And I Am Telling You Im Not Going from Dreamgirls<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|2QAYU4NOaa	Try some tough Broadway songs:<br>  <br>  IF you can do it, sing "Think Of Me" from The Phantom of the Opera...if you're a soprano, that is. That song is sweet and has high notes, especially at the end. If you like a rather emotional song, you can do "Not a Day Goes By"...I highly recommend Bernadette Peter's classic version. And also her "Unexpected Song"--it's sweet, too. :)<br>  <br>  You can also try "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Miserables. Go check out Ruthie Henshall's or Lea Salonga's version. If you can belt, you can also try "Someone Like You" from Jekyll and Hyde. :) <br>  <br>  Miss Saigon has good (and amazing) songs, too. Check out Lea Salonga's "I'd Give My Life For You" and "Too Much For One Heart".<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|VDUDKkRuaa	Any song by Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston( I like her older songs), Celion Dion, or Cher.

cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	Keep playing around with your voice.  I would try to darken the sound a bit.  Experiment with how you hold your mouth when you speak and relax the larynx.  I would try to put in more of a throaty chest sound.  The main thing is just practice.  I would build my basic "straight" voice first, then specialize your training in the Hip Hop and RnB genres.  Maybe adding some mild vibrato would help for a fuller and more textured sound.<br>  <br>  Like suggested above, you may wish to try reverb and synthesizer tricks.|`|gZgB6RJXaa	You sound like you're whispering, dude. Take a biiiig breath and spit those words out. Get pissed off widdit. Also try over enunciating a little. Make those consonant sounds POP! Oh, and if you don't have a pop filter on your mic, put it at a 45 degree angle (about) and sing across it. Then you're gonna want to bring the vocal level down from where it is now, cuz it's gonna be HOT!|`|a2jRSJBqaa	Hola, well amigo, i was told by a professional that you should use a thin piece of foam about 1 inch thick over the mike so your voice will sound better.

bc92f2d77c2836bd2b3b77b8be9b0b98aa	"Vincent" is a song by Don McLean written as a tribute to Vincent Van Gogh. It is also known by its opening line, "Starry Starry Night", a reference to Van Gogh's painting Starry Night. The song mentions the title of a different painting by Van Gogh in each of its stanzas.|`|AA10944978	I am supposing you are asking about "Vincent"  By Don McLean.<br>  <br>      The Lyrics are cryptic-  However a little research into the Life of Vincent Van Gogh will reveal that while he suffered from mental Illness,  he was very interested in the human condition and availed himself to humanitarian effort.  Yet through it all he was rejected and misunderstood.    <br>  <br>  If you read the lyrics it note the change in tense, (Past to Present and alluding the the future, and back again).  I believe that the song is a personal journey of Don McLean's study of, and awaking understanding of the torture that plagued Vincent Van Gogh.

0a71d76dfa1ab1ac5d93f86e92f2f955aa	If you are referring to the remade character of Batwoman in the present series 52 from DC Comics, you have to read the covers of each issue to see where she appears.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are referring to the 1950s Bat-woman, the one with the yellow costume and the red bat on her chest, then you need to go is search of the Archive Collections that DC Comics publishes. Look for Batman, Dark Knight, or Batman & Robin. <br>  <br>  DC is also publishing a new series called "DC Showcase" in which they re-produce key issues of comics featuring a specific character, i.e. Metamorpho, Plastic Man. You can try those and see if there are any with Batman

cd5110ca054bab31f4f1ac7b449bb683aa	On February 20, 1996, the Fox Broadcasting Company aired a made-for-television telefilm based on the Marvel Comics series Generation X. The film (produced by Marvel Entertainment) featured Banshee and Emma Frost as the headmasters of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and M, Skin, Mondo, Jubilee and two new characters Buff and Refrax as students (Chamber and Husk were not written in because the budget didn't allow for the special effects their powers required). The team battled a mad scientist named Russel Tresh who used a machine to develop psychic powers. The extremely low-budget film was scoffed at by fans and plans to develop a syndicated series were abandoned.<br>  <br>  Never heard of it till I searched for it... would like to see it even if it didn't do well<br>  <br>  If the other person isn't able to get it you can check the posts on IMDB there are a lot of people there that have it.

cd5110ca054bab31f4f1ac7b449bb683aa	Akasha - Queen <br>  Enkil - King <br>  <br>  The Queen of the Damned, the novel, deals with the origins of vampires themselves. The mother of all vampires, Akasha, begins as an Egyptian queen many thousands of years ago. During this time two powerful witches (Maharet and Mekare) live in the mountains of an unnamed region. Their village is destroyed and they are taken hostage by the king and queen, who desire their knowledge. All the while, there is a bloodthirsty spirit called Amel who continually comes to the witches to ask if they need help, although they prudently decline the offer. When they tell Akasha something that she does not want to hear, she is horrified and orders the two to be raped by Khayman. Afterward they are cast out into the desert. While making her way back home with a pregnant Maharet, Mekare curses the king and queen secretly with the bloodthirsty spirit. Eventually this spirit inflicts such torment on Akasha and Enkil that they call the sisters back and beg for their aid.<br>  <br>  However, a number of conspirators have been plotting against the young king. Planning to say that the spirit killed the monarchs, the conspirators assassinate the royal couple in their possessed house. While Akasha is dying, the spirit tries to drink her blood. Instead he ends up merging with her soul, making her the first vampire. The newly arisen Akasha gives her king the Dark Gift to save his life; she also turns Khayman into a vampire. She orders the witches to be mutilated -- Maharet loses her eyes and Mekare her tongue. Afterward, Khayman comes to them and makes them into vampires as well. The three flee, but are caught by Akasha's soldiers. Khayman escapes but Maharet and Mekare are put in two separate coffins which are then set afloat on two separate bodies of water. They do not see each other again until the events of Queen of the Damned.<br>  <br>  Mekare has gone into the ground for these many centuries, while Maharet goes back to her daughter to watch over her, and her descendants. Maharet's daughter's children become what is known as the Great Family, the progeny of the Daughters of Maharet. They are traced maternally, and there are members belonging to every culture, religion, ethnicity, and race. The Great Family represents all humanity and shows the vampires what, exactly, Akasha would be destroying by creating her New World Order.<br>  <br>  It becomes clear that as the source of all vampires, Akasha and Enkil are connected to all of the undead by the blood and spirit that all vampires share. In an experiment by the first Keeper, Akasha and Enkil are exposed to sunlight when they are several thousand years old. This merely gives them a tan. However, all other vampires are wounded, and many of the weakest die, thus confirming the legend that anything that harms Akasha will also directly affect all of her progeny|`|756d8bb0a893e1d4573f47d06ecd3f4aaa	I dont know but you could check here..<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238546/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238546/full...</a>

No te obsesiones con olvidarlo, sino que debes aprender a verlo desde otra perspectiva: sí, te gusta, pero piensa friamente que no te conviene, que no podrá ser tuyo y poco a poco lo verás con más naturalidad.<br>  Un consejo: si tienes mucho roce con e′l, evítalo, pero no te empe?es en forzar la situación para no veros, eso no funciona (yo ya lo probé en su día).<br>  La mejor forma de sobrellevarlo es hacer mucha vida con tus amigas: sal y diviértete, no sabes la suerte que tienes de estar soltera y hacer lo que te de la gana!!!!!<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva y ánimo|`|fc48309747bffbb216c120c19df8619eaa	Creeme, no le vas a olvidar en la vida. <br>  Yo ahora mismo tengo 25 a?os, y tengo novio y soy feliz.

ZT0PPS9Yaa	Yeah, I thought it was pretty scary! People in the theater were jumping and screaming alot during the movie! The zombie attack scenes were real scary! Only problem I had with the movie is that the camera jumps around too much whenever they showed the zombies! Still, it was way better than part one!

OkTQpUzZaa	I've seen both movies, and both Mark Wahlberg and Alicia Silverstone went extremely crazy for the objects of their affection... But I would say, in my opinion, The Crush is the better "crazy obsession" film.
p121GAmbaa	If I am familar with the brand of cloting and I know how their clothes fit my body, I will shop online without hesitation (usually only for a sale), because I know it's likely that the garment will fit properly. I do like shopping in stores as well, just so I can be certain about the fabric and color of things. Sometimes, I'll "window shop" and try on things in person just to see what I like, and then buy the things online when they go on sale.|`|0d773e42d1e0d24b1c557c580291b45caa	at the store,always !!|`|76dc74698e60bba597f008397bd36b7faa	clothing,no...but shoes yes!the past 3 yrs.

I have had nothing but bad luck with marriage. Marriage is a VERY, VERY HARD GIG!!!  Make absolutely sure both of you are mature enough to handle it, make sure both of you are committed to each other. Love and/or lust won't make the marriage last by itself. It won't last, if only one of you is the only one willing to make it work, it will take both of you to respect each other and to always want the best for the other one.|`|24cd5f0b57bd0cb03485550a8be13e35aa	The age you feel ready!

c7e5e4ec9757f2ec1fcaffe8ea9c4a36aa	Once upon a time Santa tripped over a bucket and broke his leg so Mrs. Claus had to do all of the deliveries on Christmas Eve.  First on her list was the nice little Penelope who said she wanted Tom Cruise dressed up in leather pants with a big red bow wrapped around him.  When She went down the chimney though she was amazed to find herself in the kitchen and Penelope's cat was on the counter eating Blue cheese.  Being a Blue Cheese hater Mrs. Clause dumped Tom on a stool and tried to go back up the chimney.  Santa had taught her how to go down but not up the chimney and she got stuck.  She wiggled and squirmed for hours and hours and was soooo worried about all of the other good little boys and girls on her list.  She was stuck all night though and when Penelope got up she was so pleased to see Tom That she lit a fire in the fire place to enhance the mood.  Suddenly they hear screaming from the chimney and called an ambulance to come and get poor Mrs. Claus.  <br>  <br>  This is why Christmas was so bad last year.  The End|`|0b8db0ba29e1be2aab2a7322891be7fcaa	Tom Cruise's agent told him he needed to improve his image. It seems that, out of a focus group of 100 people, 87 thought he was a ''wacko" (the remaining 13 insisted he was a "nutter".) <br>  "Tommy," said the agent, dipping his pizza crust in blue cheese, "it's too late to convince them you're sane. What you need to do is be a more interesting lunatic."<br>  He concluded that there was nothing for it but to dress up in drag (he looked remarkably like Mrs. Claus), climb Mt. Aetna, and drop in a bucket of costume jewelry.  Unfortunately, the volcano spit the cheap trinkets back out, and one rhinestone-encrusted hatpin lodged in our intrepid mountaineer's left eye. The ambulance couldn't possibly drive up the mountain, and the helicopter pilot, out lingerie shopping in leather pants, didn't notice his cell phone vibrating. Poor Tom had to be retrieved by a trained albatross.|`|74c9e09df5c934e04845c09ba291fef8aa	Tom Cruise looking very hot in his leather pants.

It was her day to take the bucket of blue cheese to the store. <br>  The streets were busy, buses, trucks, cars and ambulances were going up and down the road. I wonder what was going on...then I heard some one say ..LOOK ...there is Tom Cruise!  There he was in those tight leather pants ... he was so hot looking... hotter than a volcano!?|`|0a1b5abcfa18779be9d86412c936d33aaa	I was cruising along in an ambulance with Tim Cruise, when suddenly a volcano erupted.  Up spewed Mrs. Clause in leather pants.  She spun around three times in the air and landed head first in a bucket of blue cheese.|`|a141b77e80c2c1c9b2fa4e49a4dfc234aa	I once had a dream I went out with  *Tom Cruise.<br>  he was wearing *leather pants.

Yesterday, I caught Tom Cruise and Mrs. Claus in the back of an ambulance bangin' right on the gurney.  Tom's leather pants were down around his ankles and Mrs. Claus had a bucket over her head.  I screamed "WTF Tom Cruise, Santa is gonna kick your a**."  Then I looked down and Mrs. Claus had all this blue cheese sqeezing out of her monkey toes.  And as Tom Cruise finished, Mrs. Claus hollered "Tommy baby, you're such a volcano."<br>  <br>  Hope you like it.  That was fun.|`|vqHtcMohaa	Tom Cruise in his leather pants went to buy a bucket full of blue cheese .They saw an ambulance by the way to the shop.Many people were died and many of them were injured by the blowing volcano.They after shopping went to the hospital and donated blood and some money to the injured poors.|`|y0ut5Xc5aa	Tom Cruise is a man from aliens that came from a volcano.

vpQucBzlaa	Si,no estes en duda, en el cd original pasa eso que vos escuchaste.<br>  En el disco Sue?os Líquidos de Maná se llevó a envían mensajes subliminales utilizando la técnica “Backward Masking”. Cuando la última canción se termina, el contador digital sigue contando. Pasan 15 segundos de silencio y se empieza a oír una voz grabada al revés. Obviamente no se entiende. A Alex González, baterista de la agrupación, se le preguntó cuál era el motivo de esa grabación invertida. él explicó que Sergio Vallin, guitarrista, se puso a cantar y bromear con una canción al estilo country, hizo reír al resto de la agrupación la cual grabo la broma de Vallin para dar paso a un concurso, pero no era así, al invertir la grabación se encontró que no existe ninguna canción, es más bien un trozo de poesía. Su letra dice así: "Katan, tu que te extra?o mi amor, siento que muero pues no tengo calor". Después de la palabra calor la voz sigue hablando, La grabación se examino una y otra vez hasta concluir lo siguiente: La voz que habla al revés después de los 15 segundos de silencio tiene un mensaje pro suicidio oculto. Cualquier persona que tenga el disco de Maná podrá escucharlo sin tener que invertir la grabación.<br>  ?Por qué el mensaje oculto en el final del disco Sue?os Líquidos es pro suicidio? Por que al oyente lo están invitando a que asuma (consejo) la muerte (me mata) que proviene de las fuerzas del mal (demon / demonio).|`|bDTnyfVuaa	Asi es, al final tiene un ruido que si lo escuchas al reves es una peque?a cancioncita algo asi como un hidden track pero lo tienes que escuchar al reves<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|cf4cfe916933c1968b4f88da558c40f2aa	hola, muy probablemente tu cd salio con algún defecto de fabrica por eso se oyen esos ruidos raros, yo lo tengo y no se oye nada aparte de las canciones, buen día|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	es cierto yo lo tengo y si al final se escuchan unos ruidos le dije a mi amiga pero ella no lo escucho y era el mismo disco

Tal vez piense: "Oh, los nativos del lugar duermen siestas subterráneas para librarse del calor y despiertan poseídos del amok". O bien: "Los nativos están inquietos: debe ser por esta manía incivilizada de enterrarse vivos. What a pity!" <br>  <br>  Y todo esto, suponiendo que Sting se digne venir a la indómita Latinoamérica para pasar sus vacaciones. <br>  <br>  Por otro lado, si por casualidad te libra del percance, <br>  se proclamará orgullosamente como tu dios personal. <br>  Te exigirá adoración y castigará tus transgresiones sin piedad. Pero, si decides<br>  seguir sus dictámenes (es decir, si le sigues la corriente),<br>  puede que te convierta en el San Pedro de su religión. <br>  ?Qué más quieres?|`|76b3c05d21399843723b82e12871f96faa	jajajajaj ese capitulo de Los Simpsons fue genial!!!|`|7b1b452f41b2674a43b4714305cd5096aa	Hay que preguntarle a Timmy O′Toole (ah no, ese era Bart)...|`|AA11690026	No. No iría.<br>  <br>  Solo va por algún integrante de los Simpson, jajajajajaja<br>  <br>  Y no iría por la misma y simple razón del porqué una hindú se casó con su novio muerto.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tublog-christian.blogspot.com/2007/03/mujer-de-la-india-se-casa-con-un-muerto.html" rel="nofollow">http://tublog-christian.blogspot.com/200...</a>|`|10432e0c8a813548852b600458b69032aa	POR SUPUESTO,IRIA CON UNA PALA Y UN CAMION DE TIERRA,Y RESCATARIAMOS A LA SOCIEDAD DE LAS TRISTES TORTURAS,SALUDOS|`|2349ba91b815c3c12cf736c03dec01c5aa	si no eres de Springfield no viene.|`|GswAg4mMaa	alto !! en primera no se qien es sting ...pero al ser un cantante como dices no creo qe se ensucie las mannos para sacartee pueda y le diga a alguna de sus gentes qe te saqen pero el no olvidalo!!<br>  <br>  byeee!! yo qe tu me aventara a un pozo**pueda y no llegue y ahi te qedas!!<br>  <br>  amor y paz|`|fbd281888cb1a2f664006f5a3c2e186caa	Jajajajaja el capitulo cuando Bart cumple a?os, no ma... saque un monton de curas cuando Bart mete un localizador al pozo y todo mundo cree que es un ni?o quien esta adentro, muy tonto el se mete y batallan para rescatarlo, por lo que Sting lo rescata y pues cualquier mujer o hombres que sean fans de Sting quisieran que lo rescataran si caen en un pozo jajajajaja.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|fc3708ed4398a8b3afd57e2cdb827f83aa	Si eso te hubiera ocurrido hace 10 a?os....quizas lo haria<br>  Pero como ya lo hizo, no caera en el enga?o 2 veces<br>  <br>  Ni aunque te llamaras Timmy O'toole<br>  <br>  Mejor deberias probar alguna enfermedad rara o que te inventaran una cancion de cumplea?os<br>  <br>  A Lisa le funciono.............<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte|`|gBvoyeEBaa	Seguramente viajaría imediatamente al sitio donde estes en apuros...no lo dudo ???<br>  Porque te digo si?

ptCyxkMwaa	a mi no me gusto este disco tanto como los anteriores, sin embargo, sigo una gran fan de bunbury, he escuchado bastantes veces la canción de "Puta Desagradecida" y debo decir que me gusta mucho, no me siento ofendida porque no dice nada agresivo para las mujeres de manera general, es solo que esta un poco dolido con una chica, me parece que existen canciones mas agresivas y que nadie se toma por aludido, y opino que Bunbury en un gran cantate, sin embargo, mi opinion no es imparcial, ya que soy una loca fanatica de el. saluditos :)|`|2f6PH05paa	psssssss de poca madreeeeeeeee|`|UlfewxVraa	Pues no es muy nuevo ya tiene sus meses en el mercado.... bueno por lo menos acá en Mexico ya tiene tiempo que salio.

16d05f506420b3ba612bd61977ab7892aa	That's a simple but old fashioned way to frame a shot - Directors use that method to crop their vision to "see" what a camera would see. A viewfinder is used by many directors to get an idea of what the camera would see and then uses that as a planning tool to frame a shot and explain to the director of photography where to place the camera. To accurately see what the camera sees, today TV monitors are used on set and send an image directly from the camera so the director can see the shot. Some directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, never looked through the camera but used the creativity of the director of photography to frame the shot that Hitchcock had described in production planning and through storyboards, which are artists rendering of scenes based on the film's script.|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	Not really.  If they want to check a possible frame, they borrow a plastic or cardboard template from the director of photography or cinematographer.<br>  <br>  This is more of a device used in movies to give the actor playing the director something to do.|`|qNvPOWymaa	They make a square or rectangle with their hands so that they can frame what they are seeing as if seeing it through a camera.

ajb4mSpHaa	La película trata sobre un reportero que descubre que en un pueblito de Virginia, la gente empieza a ver extra?os sucesos relacionados a una creatura que llaman "Mothman", al parecer la creatura trae una profecía de que un cataclismo le ocurrirá al pueblito en el futuro cercano. El cataclismo resulta ser el derrumbamiento de un puente.<br>  <br>  Ahora, la película estuvo basada en un libro de John Keel, pero el libro no era ficción, sino estudios sobre un caso real. Resulta que en ese pueblito deVirginia en los 60s se empezó a aparecer una extra?a creatura voladora que los habitantes llamaron "Mothman" inspirados por la serie de TV de "Batman". El monstruo desapareció después del colapso de un puente en 1967, que mató a 46 personas, por lo que se considerá que el mosntruo apareció como advertencia. Ahora, segun el autor Loren Coleman (un criptozoologo que estudió el caso por muchos a?os), el colapso del puente fue sólo la primera de varias tragedias relacionadas con el Mothman y el creó la teoría de la "Maldición de Mothman", según la cual, las personas que vieron o tuvieron algo que ver con el monstruo estan condenadas a morir.

Simplemente, no pueden haber -y perdoná mi francés...- "ca9ado" la historia así.

Qué carajos significa eso!!!<br>  <br>  Así que honestamente, espero que ya no hagan ninguna secuela más de Cenicienta. Quién sabe con qué podrían llegar a salir!!!

549f1e26b195cf93adf9b4b344c69d76aa	OUAH!!!! Je suis fan de cette série. Je n'ai pas de saisons préférée. Par contre g des épisodes  préférés, celui ou Angel meurt, l'épisode où elle se fight avec faith, l'épisode ou c le silence total, l'épisode après la mort de la mère de Buffy où elle révèle enfin à sa soeur ce qu'elle a sur le coeur, l'épisode où elle meurt bien s?r. J'adore quand on l'entend parler calmement et pendant ce temps on la voit qui saute et qui souffre (j'ai trop pleuré)<br>  Y a aussi l'épisode musical, l'épisode où elle est moitié dans un asil de fou. Vous vous souvenez de la fin, les médecins disent qu'elle a replongé et du coup on se dit "ouah, c qu'elle monde le vrai ?"<br>  J'ai adoré aussi (g failli oublié) le combat final avec Adam où ils utilisent les pouvoirs de la 1ère tueuse. Et aussi celui d'après qd la première tueuse essai de tous les tués dans leurs rêves.<br>  Enfin bon je m'arrête là parce que je pourrais en parler pendant des heures.<br>  Et toi ? Dis nous ce que tu en penses et quelle(s) saisons as tu préféré ?|`|161376283e844f865bf1ea2c3efb47dcaa	^moi ma saison préférée c'est la 2 ème.|`|2e2a245231adb477a63114a35ef84999aa	C'était ma série préférée quand j'étais ado. Ma saison préfére c'est celle où elle perd sa mère et saute dans le vide pour sauver sa soeur|`|7kuyvz78aa	salut;<br>  voila pour moi Buffy contre les vampires et la serie par exellence à laquel on a pa pu passer a coter. Elle est et restera a jamais inégalable. Les perso et les histoires sont bien fait ainsi que le choix des acteurs vu que maintenant on a droit qu'au blonde au gros nibard(stéréotipes de merde!) C'est une serie génial dans tous les sens du terme. Je regrette beaucoup cette series parce que en ce moment on n'arrête pas d'eesayer de nous faire regarder des grosses merde qui tente désespérement de la copier mais ils ne l'atteindrons jamais à la cheville.<br>  Des séries comme ?a on en fait plus c'est vraiment dommage.<br>  Ma saison préféré  c'est la 5. Avec Goria, comme méchante elle est trop cool et c'est super original. L'épisode du grand plongeons c'est vraiment du grand art et c'est très émouvant.<br>  Je suis contente qu'ils ne soit pas arrêter là et surtout la suite était quand même crédible je doit quand même avouer que j'avais peur que sa fasse moche.Mais c'était super bien fait et yavait de nouvelle question existentielle qui se posait.<br>  enfin bref c'est la meilleur série de tous les temps. j'ai grandi avec cette serie je ne men lasse jamais. j'ai tous les dvd de buffy.Franchement une série comme ?a sa force le respect.!!<br>  <br>  Buffy forever!!!|`|84072fbbdfd9e15c2f553a7a60321545aa	J'adoooooore Buffy !!!!<br>  Celles que j'ai le moins aimées : la saison 1, la 4 et la saison 7. La première était trop immature, la 4 était vraiment nulle avec ce blaireau de Ryan, et la dernière décevante. J'ai adoré la saison 5, avec la fin qu'on conna?t, snifou ! La 6 m'avait l'air pas mal du tout, j'aimais beaucoup le couple 'Spuffy', mais malheureusement je n'ai pas pu la voir entièrement. Sinon la 2 et la 3, l'époque 'Angelus' et le duo Buffy-Faith, c'était assez intense. <br>  Beaucoup de gens pense que c'est une série à neuneux alors qu'elle est en fait extrêmement transgressive, les thèmes abordés sont toujours bien plus profonds qu'il n'y paraissent, et souvent sulfureux ! Les gens pensent souvent à tord que c'est juste l'histoire d'une héro?ne sexy qui éclate des méchants en carton pate, mais si la série est effectivement kitsh, le thème central de la mort est toujours traité douloureusement, associé à l'amour, au sexe, à la frustration. Buffy est quelqu'un de complètement dépressif, qui aime l'interdit (les vampires) et qui sera éternellement malheureuse (cf : elle ne peut pas coucher avec Angel sous peine de lui ?ter son ame et de faire courir le monde à la catastrophe; Spike, qui renonce à sa condition et fini par se sacrifier pour le monde, et pour gagner son Amour). Enfin bref, je pourrai continuer des heures comme ?a...L'amour, le sexe, l'amitié, la mort, le passage à l'age adulte, le destin, l'échec, la résignation, l'abnégation, le bien, le mal...tout y est ! Cette série est absolument GéNIALE.|`|92I6w3yFaa	elles sont toutes les 7 géniales avec leurs différents méchants<br>  saison 1: le ma?tre<br>  saison 2: Spike et Drucilla<br>  saison 3: Le maire de Sunnydale<br>  saison 4: Adam<br>  saison 5: Gloria<br>  saison 6: Warren et sa bande et Dark Willow<br>  saison 7: La force|`|FoWQv6LYaa	C'est vieux comme mes robes ?a !!!!|`|RVr3K5CTaa	Buffy est à deux niveaux :<br>  <br>  1) la série vue par des ado et pré-pubères au niveau soap, starac et autres histoires à l'eau de rose. Ils ne voient que la partie "ah Buffy aime Angel", la partie "midinette" décrite dans la réponse précédente (PS : Spike ne meure pas dans Buffyverse, le pendentif issu de Lindsay McDonald en fait et non d'Angel est prévu pour)<br>  <br>  2) une série fantastique avec une construction cohérente, poussée, inventant tout un monde (le buffyverse) avec son histoire, sa géographie (les autres dimensions), sa mythologie. Le tout sur le mythe des vampires, en rajoutant l'originalité du traitement et leur origine, la poursuite en incorporant les démons, la vie des humains avec les démons (?a se poursuit surtout dans Angel cette partie) finissant, par exemple, par l'explication du règne des Dieux avec Ilyria, avant les vampires, avant les démons. Finalement, les vampires ne sont plus qu'un détail à la fin dans le Buffyverse qui va au-delà de la simple bataille du bien contre le mal (c'est l'équilibre des forces qui est en jeu, pas la défaite du mal)<br>  <br>  ?a a été tout le génie de Wheddon d'avoir ces deux niveaux afin d'attirer les ado qui ne l'ont compris que comme "Beverly hills et les vampires" et les fans de fantastique cohérent et complexe.<br>  Il est alors évident que les ado n'ont pas aimé à partir du moment où le groupe n'est plus ado et qu'on est vraiment dans le monde des adultes (l'épisode de la mort de lJoyce est fabuleux) mais surtout complètement dans le coté fantastique exigeant un peu de réflexion.<br>  <br>  La saison 4 est connue pour être la moins bonne. Il y a une explication : Il ne devait pas y avoir d'Adam de la même fa?on, la méchante de l'année était le professeur Walsh, mais l'actrice les a  laché en milieu de saison. Ils ont du tout réécrire perdant de la cohérence. Mais quand on reregarde la saison 4 en connaissant la suite, elle prend toute son importance (c'est quand même la saison de rupture définitive avec Angel, avec Faith repassant du coté du bien, c'est la saison où Buffy et Angel peuvent enfin être ensemble, où Angel redevient humain puis y renonce etc. même si ?a ne se passe qu'à moitié dans Buffy)<br>  <br>  La saison 5 a été écrite pour être la dernière. La série devait se terminer par le mort de Buffy. Et comme elle a été reprise par une autre chaine, ?a a continué.<br>  <br>  La série prend toute sa maturité à partir de la saison 6 tant au niveau des personnages que du Buffyverse avec l'apothéose de la saison 7. C'est une des meilleures fins de série qu'il soit : elle ferme l'intrigue tout en permettant une suite (une partie se fera d'ailleurs dans Angel)<br>  Difficile de choisir entre ces deux saisons mais j'ai une préférence pour la saison 6 (Dark Willow est stupéfiante et on est enfin débarrassé de la mollesse de Tara)<br>  <br>  L'évolution des personnages est quand même stupéfiante notamment les seconds couteaux : Cordelia qui de la pom-pom girl ne pensant qu'aux fringues, passe à un être mi-humain, mi démon, engendre le mal, devient une des puissances du bien régissant l'équilibre des univers ! Ou Alex qui prend la suite des hommes en noir en changeant le type de protection, tandis que Willow est une nouvelle génération de gardienne.<br>  <br>  Buffy est inégalée pour l'instant dans ce type de mythologie d'une série télévisée. Elle est aussi inégalée dans sa lecture à deux niveaux. Et pourtant il y en a eu des essais de copie (Roswell, Dark Angel, et Smallville), toutes sont relativement nulles n'arrivant pas à décoller de "belles nanas à grosse poitrine, un peu plus agé qu'un ado et ayant des problèmes de coeur"|`|743040753087a1eae8603ea99819cacfaa	Celles où il y avait Charisma Carpenter...|`|1c6e82effed233b152bf51824636d1adaa	la derniere|`|46e437ba7656607e8a523ea9270148ffaa	les 2 voir 3 premières saisons (aprés j'ai été moins attentif)<br>  <br>  ciao|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	j'adorais, c'étais une de mes séries préférées, ma saison préférée, la dernière, la troisième était pas mal aussi avec l'arrivé de Faith.<br>  superbe série....!|`|xRaGyugTaa	j adore buffy et la saison  qui m a beaucoup plus c'est quand elle est sorti avec rayle

TOhdRTEeaa	Hay un libro.. no recuerdo el titulo es de Edgar Allan Poe donde cita casos de personas que fueron enterradas vivas, y de hecho hubo un caso donde, despùes de enterrar a una mujer, unos <br>  asaltatumbas quisieron robarle las joyas con las que fue enterrada pero al abrir el ataud ella desperto..<br>  <br>  Todo eso debido a una enfermedad, donde es supuesto que tu cuerpo literalmente muera por algun tiempo determinado y mas tarde despiertes, como si hubieras estado dormida...<br>  <br>  Otro caso fue el de una joven obligada a casarse con un hombre que no amaba y segun la historia, ella "fallece" pero su verdadero amor se niega a perderla y se queda en el cementerio y al escuchar un grito ahogado la desentierra y la encuentra viva, ellos  partes a otro continente  y viven felices mientras las demas personas la dan por muerta... ( esta es una leyenda)<br>  <br>  Lo que si vi en un programa de tv, hace ya algun tiempo es que algunos investigadores estudiaron durante meses la forma y posicion en que enterraban a los difuntos en un cementerio, y abrieron cuidadosamente y la maypria de los difuntos estaban en una posicion diferente.. esto debido a un relajamiento muscular que hay despues de muerte... es decir se libera la tension.|`|OV2Fmu28aa	No y de verdad, si alguna vez le ha pasado alguna persona, que mal se debe de pasar.|`|b9c9734b9c1c5f5d580db32dbbd7efc0aa	No he conocido ninguno, pero si he escuchado casos cuando se da  la catalepsia.|`|pGcJJcNzaa	si conocí un caso donde a una nene la violaron y el violador pensó que estaba muerta pero la nena estaba desmayada y la enterró en el patio de la casa.|`|05cbc483d138fb3b203e420c7245b414aa	Yo si.<br>  En mi ciudad hace algunos a?os una persona fue enterrada viva, supimos porque el velador del cementerio dijo escuchar fuertes ruidos durante la noche en una fosa, las autoridades decidieron exhumar el cuerpo para saber a que se debian aquellos ruidos, al hacer esto se encontraron con que el ataud estaba totalmente rasgu?ado y llegaron a la conclusion de que la ni?a habia sido enterrada viva.Por desgracia esto no fue a tiempo pues la ?i?a aguanto mucho tiempo y murio en su deseperacion dentro del cajon<br>  Que triste no crees?<br>  aparte la ni?a debe haber estado desesperada, por eso lo mejor es asegurarse por diversos metodos de que la persona en rtealidad haya fallecido.|`|ftJcLLlXaa	no, no eh visto ningun caso bueno solo en las novelas pero si los entierran vivos son porque tienen una enfermedad que duermen y despues despiertan!

Paf tu mets des lunnettes à kkun et il est moche! affligeant!! Et l'appareil dentaire, c peut etre un critere physique naturel ? lol! Mais c vrai apres la transformation de Lisa sera plus facile! Tu lui mets des lentilles, t'enleves l'appareil!! Tu lui fais un masque pour cheveux et une nouvelle coupe et tu la mets au sport! et voilà c un canon !

RVr3K5CTaa	Supernatural n'est pas seulement une série sur les démons et vampires (il y en aura aussi), c'est d'abord une intrigue récurrente (la recherche du démon qui a tué leur mère), une histoire familiale et on aura un début de réponse en fin de saison (notamment pourquoi sa mère, qu'est-ce qu'il y avait de spécial etc.)<br>  La série se regarde avec plaisir. Laissez un peu le temps aux séries de s'installer, sinon c'est le règne du "pas assez d'audience au bout de 2 épisodes, allez, à la poubelle !"<br>  <br>  Il est assez injuste de comparer avec Buffy qui a eu 7 saisons plus un spin-off pour installer une véritable mythologie, ce que la saison 1 ne présageait pas (une série pour ado avec quelques monstres), le film encore moins.|`|f30f77e134dad497bb9f315dfa6848d5aa	Bof !

Ca n'innove pas assez. C'est Buffy en pantalons et on reprend les stéréotyoes et les classiques du genre. Il y a des séries qui, tout en s'inspirant des classiques, ont réussi à faire quelquechose d'original mais pas cette séries en tous cas. Encore une qui ne passera pas la première saison...
UbmbPNFLaa	J'aimais mieux le précédent générique, mais je pense que c'est surtout une question d'habitude. Sinon, j'attend que l'intrigue soit vraiment lancée. La 3ème saison semble fidèle aux deux précédentes. Et je suis plut?t contente que Logan et Veronica soient enfin ensemble (même si ?a ne va pas durer semble-t-il).

On va découvrir qui a tué le Doyen de l'université, logan et veronica vont ressortir ensemble, puis rompre, puis ressortir ensemble puis rompre encore et au final logan va sortir avec la colocataire de Mac!<br>  Un personnage que veronica n'aime pas particulierement va mourrir et son père va retrouver son ancien bureau.<br>  Bref c'est pas terrible terrible...|`|xRaGyugTaa	le générique ?a va mais je préfère le 2 et le début trop génial , les personnages ?a va et j adore david tom il est trop beau sinon je suis triste parce que demain ils vont arrêter la diffusion de veronica mars|`|GDzaeailaa	je préférais l'ancien générique....<br>  La relation Logan-Veronica est un peu prévisible....<br>  Et je trouve que l'intrigue est moins forte que celle de la saison 2 (le bus dégringole dès l'épisode 1 !).

Ou est ce que la série s'arrete a la saison 3 aux USA ?|`|fe93d647a5a5b17f33369427637147aeaa	ouai la saison 3 est pas mal: intrigues; amours...<br>  mais franchement balancer toutes les infos-spoilers comme ?a je trouve ?a un peu deg pour les autres...

lq01zm9Iaa	Porque RBD la saco como un cover en espa?ol de la misma la letra no es igual pero el ritmo sip, la original es la de Hilary Duff, creo que debieron hacerlo ya que ella estuvo colaborando con ellos en la novela, salio en unos capitulos, por lo cual no fue un plagio sino otra versión con su autorización claro esta... Creo que se dio lo mismo que con la canción Connected de Sara Paxton la cual ellos sacaron con el nombre Tenerte y Quererte... Obvio que me parecen mucho mejores las versiones originales... Bye Salu2|`|996944d8fba262339b8be53f3d4b66eeaa	Yo ya me fijé en esto, la canción Tu dulce voz, de RBD es exactamente la misma que Little voice, de Hilary Duff, solo que traducida al espa?ol... La canción "Little voice" de Hilary Duff, es de su primer disco "Metamorphosis", publicado en 2003 y "Tu dulce voz" de RBD, es de su tercer y último disco publicado este mismo a?o [2007] "Celestial".<br>  Está claro quien la hizo antes... Lo que yo no tengo claro es si los de RBD fueron y la copiaron o lo hicieron con el permiso de Hilary...<br>  Yo también hice esta misma pregunta:<br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AroWKlRfkX.YIkPUJavJzM1p.gt.?qid=20070521134049AAr0Lzn">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  Saludos y espero que hayas salido de dudas!<br>  <br>  -->Gracias!

La canción de Hilary Duff habla de que no puede volver con su ex-novio porque su conciencia (the little voice) no se lo permite. En cambio la cancion de RBD habla de la voz del chico/a. Lo único que tienen en común es una frase, y eso pasa en muchas otras canciones|`|W8Ps6YWuaa	De seguro rbd, nunca han tenido cabeza para inventar canciones, solo saber robar credito a los demas|`|a8ae45e681efcadc3186382eed1d0d42aa	Por Dios! obvio que los copiones son<br>  los de RBD.. son unos inoriginales<br>  igual q los de Panda ??|`|e87d548a5c7d8516e4ebbbf94435075aaa	Obviamente los de rbd le copiaron a la Duff...es imposible que ese grupo de nacos interprete algo que les han compuesto a ellos...son un asco!, ni para escribir una canción!|`|nc1Y9MGPaa	Hola!!!<br>  <br>  RBD es el copion ?Quien mas?

ptCyxkMwaa	A mi tambien me gustan, y tanto como tu, ya somos varios los que tenemos una peque?a obsesión por el grupo, probablemente no sean los mejores del mundo, pero eso representan para nosotros los super fans de Bunbury y Heroes!! :)|`|86bc729117d8cc79107faca9ebdede72aa	Me gusta mucho no me considero super fan pero disfruto de sus canciones que por cierto estoy escuchando Opio una de mis favoritas ;)|`|87187257209b8f471bf7e13cc5ad48cdaa	si estan chidos, de hecho ahorita estoy escuchando Infinito de Bunbury...|`|RbN53NP0aa	Es muy buen no croe que sea la mejor, pero buena y con una gran historia,, a mi me encanta|`|KpZ1YXOkaa	Para mi es la mejor banda de rock que ha dado Espa?a y la que mas exito ha tenido a nivel internacional. Además su evolución es más que respetable en cada uno de sus discos llegando a su nnivel más álgido con avalancha producido por el mismisimo Bob Ezrin (KISS, HANOI ROCKS, ALICE COOPER....).|`|c6VCdhB5aa	A mi me encantan hace muuuuchos a?os que los escucho, no sé si será la mejor banda que exista, pero tienen un estilo único, espero que Bunbury pueda volver a cantar como cantaba en Héroes, porque su voz y estilo han cambiado mucho, me gustaba más como cantaba en Héroes.<br>  Obviamente en septiembre los voy a ver cuando estén acá en la Argentina.<br>  Saludos!|`|cAvmxN4Faa	a mi me gustan pero no creo que sean lo mejor que exista|`|uOW6zga2aa	ese grupo es muy bueno ami me encanta|`|yN1FyPkVaa	son geniales pero a gustos colores. a heroes le pongo un 10 al guitarrista. y bunbury mas bien parece un siervo del diablo cuando canta. en fin... buen grupo.|`|S5Gkcypgaa	me justa pero eso grupo creo que ya no existe solo su musica es sierto parque fue y sigue siento unas de las mejores canciones del mundo pero su grupo ya termino y ya estan aburriendo ya|`|d01aa2fe42272b318340981775c3076eaa	YO creo que es la mejor banda de rock moderno en espa?ol que ha existido, pero la mejor banda musical que ha existido han sido The Beatles, no es por que me gusten, es por que se han realizado inumerables encuestas y siempre arrojan el mismo resultado

Résultat, je trouve que les footballeurs sont un peu chochottes - dès qu'on les pousse un peu, ils se tordent de douleur - et assez mauvais joueur.<br>  <br>  De plus, je crois pas que le milieu du football soit très représentatif de l'esprit de fair play (aucun respect même pour les arbitres) et d'amour de l'exploit sportif (trop d'argent).<br>  <br>  Mais ce n'est que mon avis...|`|89e656c8b00e5ca7b1b0ac51222c4042aa	pareil, le foot pour moi c est que l equipe de france, la finale de la champion's ligue et les matches intercités dans mon quartier, y a des champions !|`|9122499f70209497b50746f6b4bbf672aa	je ne le supporte plus depuis le match de la semaine dernière entre l'angleterre et la france.<br>  vive le rugby|`|9IcvIyWUaa	Moi non plus ! je ne fais pas parti des moutons, lors de la coupe du monde, le jour de la finale je crois,  j'étais sur un voilier au milieu de nul part.

c66a871d08314e926aa7ce9d58b07d06aa	I think every person has their own individual hopes and dreams, so i dont think its really possible to share a dream unless the other person wants exactly the same dream as you....so i think the most you can do really is share your hopes and dreams with another by simply telling them what they are, and what you hope to achieve and do someday. And i guess some people do prefer keeping their dreams to themselves...and to answer your question, well personally, im a pretty private person so i dont really talk about my hopes and dreams that much, other than when im with my friends. :)|`|AA11425428	I kip them 2 myself|`|8a9b18cfda4155409a011be661d9062eaa	i share them usually. good luck.|`|bjZRJhULaa	Want me to share?

He goes to bed at 9 and some nights dosen't fall asleep till 2 in the morning. He is not allowed to play his video games, or use the computer during the week and jumps on his huge trampoline outside for hours at a time, he has a go- cart and a quad so he's always outside playing...it's real believe me!!!|`|gGVO9PRJaa	I don't think it's real.  It's bad enough these drug companies are feeding us this crap about we need to take drugs if we're depressed, have insomnia, have heartburn, etc.  But I think they have gone way out of line suggesting we need to give our children drugs to calm them down.  50-60 years ago this mess was never heard of.  No one complained about their children being too hyper or can't pay attention to things.  But then again, back then, people had their children doing some type of work.  Not having them lay around all day watching TV and playing video games.  I think it's all a conspiracy for the drug companies to make more money.  If your child is too hyper, sign them up for some type of active hobby like Karate.  If they have a problem paying attention, cut out the TV and video games and have them read books.|`|8edee9a7924bda4d23820b1bbde0b4eeaa	Screw being politically correct, I think it's not real.

Se ricevi questa lettera, vuol dire che è arrivata. <br>  Se non la ricevi, fammelo sapere, così te la rimanderò. <br>  Scrivo lentamente perché so che tu non sai leggere in fretta. <br>  Qualche tempo fa tuo padre ha letto sul giornale che la maggior parte degli incidenti capitano entro un raggio di un chilometro dal luogo di abitazione. Allora abbiamo deciso di traslocare un po' più lontano. La nuova casa è meravigliosa. C'è una lavatrice, ma non sono sicura che funzioni. Proprio ieri ci ho messo dentro il bucato, ho tirato l'acqua e poi il bucato è sparito completamente. Il tempo qui non è <br>  troppo brutto. La settimana scorsa ha piovuto due volte: <br>  la prima volta per tre giorni e la seconda per quattro. <br>  A proposito della giacca che mi avevi chiesto, tuo zio Piero mi ha detto che spedirtela coi bottoni sarebbe stato molto caro (per via del peso dei bottoni). Allora li ho staccati. Se pensi di riattaccarli, te li ho messi tutti nella tasca interna. <br>  Tuo fratello Gianni ha fatto una grossa sciocchezza con la macchina: <br>  è sceso e ha chiuso di scatto la portiera lasciando dentro le chiavi. <br>  Allora è dovuto rientrare a casa a prendere il secondo mazzo di <br>  chiavi, e così anche noi abbiamo potuto scendere dalla macchina. <br>  Se vedi Margherita salutala da parte mia. <br>  Se non la vedi, non dirle niente. <br>  <br>  La tua mamma che ti vuole tanto bene. <br>  <br>  P.S.: volevo metterti anche un po' di soldi, <br>  ma avevo già chiuso la busta.|`|QkAYCpIzaa	Quanti carabinieri servono per cambiare una lampadina?<br>  Tre..uno che infila la lampadina e due che girano la sedia.|`|ROBofBxZaa	Un marine in Iraq riceve un giorno, una lettera dalla sua fidanzata.

Mi dispiace. Per favore rimandami la foto che ti avevo spedito. Mary. <br>  Il soldato ci resta malissimo. Chiede ai compagni di regalargli una foto delle loro fidanzate, mogli, sorelle, cugine o amiche. Riceve 57 fotografie.

Porta Pierino nell'ufficio del direttore. <br>  Mentre Pierino aspetta nel corridoio la maestra spiega la situazione al direttore.<br>  Il direttore dice alla maestra che metterà il ragazzo alla prova: <br>  gli farà una serie di domande, se lui sbaglia una qualsiasi delle risposte <br>  dovrà tornare in prima e comportarsi bene. La maestra è d'accordo. <br>  Pierino viene fatto entrare, gli vengono spiegate le condizioni <br>  e lui accetta di sottoporsi alla prova. <br>  Il direttore esordisce: <br>  - Quanto fa 3 x 3? <br>  Pierino: <br>  - Nove! <br>  - Quanto fa 6 x 6? <br>  - Trentasei! <br>  E così via con ogni domanda che il direttore presuppone <br>  che un allievo della terza debba conoscere. <br>  Il direttore guarda la maestra e le dice: <br>  - Credo che Pierino possa andare in terza... <br>  La maestra dice al direttore: <br>  - Posso fargli io qualche domanda? <br>  Il direttore e Pierino acconsentono.

e37773e90cc3c5a9e1c00c538eeb30a6aa	es una convinacion de cosas.<br>  <br>  por un lado como ya dijeron es una forma de nacionalismo mal entendido, "el malo es el diferente a nosotros".<br>  <br>  si te remontas al cine más viejo encontraras que en las peliculas de vaqueros los malos no solo son los "indios", si no tambien los que usan sombrero *****.<br>  <br>  el gringo busca estigmatizar a todos sus enemigos, y no quise decir estereotipar, sino estigmatizarlos como gente diferente a ellos.<br>  <br>  por eso es que los gringos son tan fanaticos de las peliculas de ciencia ficción, "nadie que sea de este mundo es capas de enfrentarlos", por eso necesitan enemigos interplanetarios o moustros, criaturas paranormales o cualquier entidad a la que puedan dotar de poderes descomunales, solo ellos estan más o menos a su nivel.<br>  <br>  ahora, no se te olvide lo que bien se?alas, el cine para los gringos es una forma de propaganda y ellos necesitan convencer a sus ciudadanos de que los malos, los realmente malos, estan fuera de su país, y hay que combatirlos.<br>  <br>  en el caso de Spierlberg no olvides que es judio, y los judios son los due?os de hollywood desde que hollywood existe, es natural que sus enemigos sean los arabes, claro, la SONY esta comprando todo lo que puede (paramount pictures, tristar pictures, entre otras) con capital japones, y es por eso que ahora podemos ver películas como "cartas desde iwojima", a donde los japoneses resultan los buenos de la historia.<br>  <br>  para un caucasico como john ford los malos eran los "pieles rojas", se dice que en sus películas "mato" (mato en la ficción claro) a más indios que el general coster en toda su vida.<br>  <br>  por eso hasta hace pocos a?os no habia barbies negras, ni mucho menos latinas o asiaticas, por que la barbie debe ser rubia... por que es la "mujer perfecta".<br>  <br>  cuantos super héroes ****** conoces?, y hablo de super héroes de tradición, los de verdad, por lo menos con más de 20 a?os de existir, cuantos héroes latinos conoces?<br>  <br>  el malo siempre sera el hispano, el *****, el italiano, el arabe, el asíatico... así los ni?os no sentiran feo cuando crescan y deban invadir algun país de esos... despues de todo, ellos son los malos de la película y los gringos los héroes de la democracia y la libertad<br>  <br>  como dato curioso, cuando se estreno "lo que el viento se llevo", los actores ****** que participarón en la película tuvieron que ir al estreno en un cine... para ******... muy aparte de los protagonistas blancos.<br>  <br>  el cine de EU esta a las ordenes de sus gobiernos y/o el capital, como ahora con los japoneses, y desgraciadamente siempre sera así.<br>  <br>  que ganan???... incentivos fiscales, evadir impuestos, lavar dinero, financiamientos multimillonarios, apoyo incondicional de las autoridades para hacer más películas.|`|24176393e1b4a409ccca63a7f0658472aa	Porque somos consumistas de productos estadounidenses, y a través de ellos, sobre todo de los medios de comunicación, tratan de adoctrinarnos.<br>  <br>  Estados Unidos siempre ha "creado" enemigos según sus necesidades, para poder justificar sus decisiones políticas tanto dentro como fuera del país.<br>  En su momento, los "malos" eran los nazis (o sea, todos los alemanes), luego todos los japones... En la Guerra Fría, los malos eran los soviéticos y, asociados a ellos, los cubanos y todos los comunistas, pseudo comunistas o similares. Hoy, los malos son todos los árabes (no importa si no son musulmanes, igual son terroristas para ellos) y, claro, todos los musulmanes.<br>  En el momento que les convenga, los "monstruos" seremos los argentinos, los chilenos, los portugueses, los australianos....<br>  <br>  Tenemos que aprender a discernir lo que es verdad y lo que nos quieren inculcar como verdad. Debemos informarnos y después formar nuestras propias opiniones.<br>  No dejemos que nos sigan manipulando más..... ..|`|7c4e34a263e1b8f370246afae07fec64aa	En realidad actúan dos cosas: la estigmatización (término de Goffman) por el cual la "raza" o los rasgos "raciales" constituyen rasgos negativos en los otros.

En cuanto a lo de spilberg munich(que supongo k es la pelicula a la k te refieres)  esta basada en un hecho real por tanto los malos son los k eran los arabes ni mas ni menos. Spilberg no tiende ha hacer peliculas cuyo enemigos sean de otras patrias o religiones a no ser esten basadas en algun hecho real. Despues esta k los enemigos sean ****** en algunas peliculas bueno esto pasa normalmente en peliculas de trama de pandilleros y todo eso y por eso ponen gente de color o hispanos cosas asi.<br>  No creo k haya racismo lo k creo es k para ellos su pais es lo primero y cuando hacen una pelicula de accion lo logico es protegerlo de alguien.<br>  <br>  Un ultimo comentario la pelicula 300 no tiene nada k ver con la guerra de irak ya k esta basada en un comic k se escribio hace a?os esta basada en la batalla de las termopilas. Una batalla historica k no tiene nada k ver con los exos actuales. Y kien dice eso es k no tiene dos dedos de frente.|`|UZLnpMpAaa	No creo que sea por racismo, simplemente es de verdad lo que están viviendo, para ellos son sus enemigos reales.<br>  <br>  Los árabes, el atentado de 11-S<br>  Los ******, guerra de secesión<br>  Los cubanos, siguen en guerra con ellos.<br>  Los mejicanos, creo que los ven como ocupan su país.<br>  <br>  Supongo, que en una película espa?ola, los enemigos serian los reales, como ellos.|`|c23128e1ae3ee0956f2c9fe5bffb2699aa	Pues depende del tema de la peli, si es de luchar contra la droga, los malos son hispanos en general, sin especificar mucho su lugar de origen, no tienen mucha idea de donde esta cada país.<br>  Si es de luchar contra el terrorismo, tráfico de armas y demás, serán arabes o de los llamados paises del Este.<br>  Si es de luchar entre polis pues alguno será ***** o hispano.<br>  ?Que le vas a hacer!, son así de simples y de inteligentes a la vez. No dejan nada al azar, esta hecho a conciencia|`|sJrftfZvaa	El extra?o a uno siempre causa temor, aun en las peliculas de todo el mundo la persona diferente es el heroe o el villano, claro que coinciden muchas veces con quien estan en conflicto para personificarlos.|`|yHkHinaMaa	?Que en las películas de Spielberg los malos son los árabes? Pues es de los pocos que muestran imparcialidad, porque siendo él judío, en su película "Munich" pone a caldo a los suyos y eso le valió que le criticaran mucho desde el sector judío. <br>  Por otro lado, cada cual hace los trabajos para ensalzar lo suyo, y si no, fíjate en todas la series de ******, donde cada vez que aparece un blanco es porque es el tonto del episodio. Si los gringos hiciéramos eso nos pondrían a parir.|`|99eaaec6a925c6752424ef269e1c4880aa	spielberg es judio por eso los malos son arabes<br>  bueno se supone que el mundo esta globalizado pero solo vemos pe que ellos tienenlis gringas por culpa del monopolio|`|T7CUHIJ6aa	puede ser....nacionalismo??? autoriatrios al extremo. el mensaje : "los gringos somos mejores"<br>  no se si son bo.lu.dos (perdon x la groseria) o se hacen pero todo el mundo los detesta|`|dfc9cf4521ea9c427478b970a709135aaa	BUENO PANA POR QUE SON DISCRIMINATIVOS..

Saludos|`|mF4Fmtk4aa	Porque ellos sólo se pintarán como los héroes...que no recuerdan que ellos nos salvaron de la invasión extraterrestre? ( El Día de la Independencia), o salvaron al mundo de un virus mortal? (Virus). Que gracias a sus superhéroes el mundo estaría podrido? Gracias a ellos el mundo está libre de asesinos...jajaja...igual y es una manera de lavarse la cabeza y realmente creer que ellos son los que salvan al mundo y no darse cuenta que ellos son los enemigos numero uno del mundo, o no? Claro! los nacos de los mexicanos, árabes, rusos, ******...son la maldición del mundo y ellos la bendición...que no es obvio? ( chequen el tono sarcástico) Dios los salve, qué haríamos sin ellos? mmm...se me ocurre, vivir mejor y en paz? jajaja
h2QYddBjaa	yo soy de mexico, y la verdad si me da pena que se corte la libertad de expresion, sobre todo de un canal opositor, yo creo que en toda nacion debe existir una libertad de opinar si el gobierno esta actuando mal o bien, no dudo que Chavez ha hecho cosas buenas por su nacion, pero a la vista de otras naciones esta quedando como un dictador, el simple hecho que de cierre un canal por que dan reportajes a la sociedad sobre como es en realidad hugo chavez, ten por seguro que si cerro un canal de television no tardara en cerrar diarios y revistas, y que pronto habra muchos  presos y exiliados politicos.|`|0MioGGTGaa	Claramente estoy en contra de cualquier acto, medida, o hecho que atente contra la libertad de expresión.

Tu y es enfermé en moyenne 3 h 30 par jour. Tu ne vas passer ta vie dans cette prison mentale. Tu vas pas laisser tous ces animateurs débiles t'avilir. La semaine sans télé, c'est l'occasion de briser la glace, de se libérer de cette machine à abrutir. Allez viens, on a une vie à vivre et un monde à transformer.<br>  <br>  N’oublions pas que notre premier environnement est notre mental. Si la télévision est polluante à fabriquer, à faire fonctionner, puis polluante comme déchet, elle est d’abord une terrible agression pour notre psychisme. Soir après soir, nous sommes assis durant de longues heures face à elle. Nous sommes hypnotisés par ces images qui scintillent. Ces mêmes images imprègnent nos cerveaux, uniformisent nos existences, nos connaissances, nos go?ts, nos désirs. Des animateurs-milliardaires avilissent notre humanité et tirent nos existences vers le bas. Des présentateurs nous bombardent d’informations parcellaires. Notre psychisme est submergé par les assauts de milliers d’images jouant avec notre sensibilité, manipulant notre affect. Des millions de spots publicitaires conditionnent notre inconscient et fa?onnent l’idéologie dominante de la télévision : celle de la société de consommation. Une idéologie où une fausse jouissance immédiate par la consommation prime sur toute volonté de sens. Une idéologie où l’apparence prime sur la pensée, le jeunisme sur la culture, le déracinement sur la filiation. Par nature, la télévision conduit à la passivité, donc à la soumission. Elle est le média de la communication superficielle, simplificatrice, n’acceptant que les discours binaires. Elle est l’outil de régression des masses dont ont besoin les publicitaires et les industriels pour réduire les êtres humains à l’état de consommateurs. La télévision est une drogue à l’égard de laquelle chacun s’emploie à masquer sa dépendance. Elle nous évite de réfléchir, de nous poser des questions existentielles, de nous retrouver face à nous-mêmes. à force de fuir dans cet écran, nous devenons incapables d’affronter la réalité. à force de bombardements d’images, notre capacité d’attention s’altère, notre imagination s’appauvrit et notre esprit critique s’épuise ; nous avons de plus en plus de mal à nous consacrer aux valeurs essentielles. Avec en moyenne 3 h 30 de télévision par jour et par Fran?ais, nous passons désormais plus d’heures à regarder des émissions sur la nature qu’à y vivre, plus de temps à rire des plaisanteries à la télévision qu’à plaisanter nous-mêmes, plus de temps à regarder des scènes simulées de sexualité qu’à faire l’amour. Après une journée de travail et plus de trois heures et demie devant le poste, le temps consacré à la vie sociale, civique ou à la création ne peut être que marginal, sinon inexistant. La critique de la télévision ne peut donc se limiter à son contenu et doit le dépasser pour s’interroger sur le média en tant que tel. Une semaine sans télé, c’est un temps pour créer, construire, apprendre, lire, réfléchir, se rencontrer et retrouver le go?t et le parfum de la VIE… éteignons le poste et la vie commencera.

Donc, il m'est difficile de faire un seul choix. La  chose que je désire le plus tout de même, c'est de rester toujours jeune, quelque soit mon age, de conserver le plus possible de mon ame d'enfant et de garder toujours la faculté de m'émerveiller. Peut-être n'as-tu pas encore fait un "grand" voyage ? Cela n'est pas le cas pour moi, puisque je suis déjà allée en vacances à l'étranger et ai beaucoup apprécié, mais ce n'est pas ce qui m'importe le plus.

Il n'y a qu'à écouter "Hurt", c'est tout simplement magnifique...|`|LUlsWCSFaa	je me suis toujours demandée si elle était chanteuse ou stripteaseuse.......|`|r7f00rc8aa	d'accord avec caro hurt très belle chanson et quelle classe <br>  et elle n'ai pas si petite que sa  et quand bien mème elle est extravagante, sexy ,mais pas vulgaire comparer a d'autre <br>   et elle tellement  grande part le talent et sa c'est déjà beaucoup <br>   et juger la ,sur sa voix et non sur son apparence|`|S0vWslwDaa	J'aime bien son physique je connais ses chansons les plus connues radio tv mais pour le reste je peux pas dire j ai jamais rien vu sur elle.|`|bc6d3edda58d299030c33c740fdd5c75aa	j'aime bien son clip "hurt", c'est mon préféré. aussi j'aime bien la chonson "ain't another man".. <br>  en tout cas j'aime bien son genre, elle me plait!|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	j'adore ce qu'elle fait, son dernier album est tout simplement superbe, j'ai de très belles "balades" comme "hurt" (superbe chanson) et d'autres plus dansantes comme "candyman" ou "ain't no other man", y'a de très belles chansons, super musique sur cet album...<br>  elle a une voix exceptionnelle, j'en connais pas beaucoup des chanteuses comme elle...<br>  son abum "stripped" est aussi super bien, j'ai vraiment appris à l'apprécié avec cet album et surtout avec la chanson "beautiful"|`|eb2a387ccc73736fdb4e222aa113333caa	Bjr très belle voix et très sexy , pimpante comme femme et artiste|`|0ddfc4e1dedba44b55428fb2ddb760deaa	Je l'adore elle est exeptionelle! J'adore surtout la chanson "Hurt"|`|55728fc95fe703e0d269723eadb47f2daa	je trouve qu'elle est super belle et en plus elle chante très bien moi aussi j'ai beaucoup adoré son dernier album|`|645dd05ae2c71f52cfff1bb77ea130d9aa	Waw!|`|8258dba9f17d856922809a78d7c600b2aa	J'aime bien!|`|b8de0453de1c3687018d59ef186dff93aa	Juste: quelle voix...<br>  <br>  Si tous les chanteurs sans talent avaient cinq Grammy Awards dans leur besace et les compliments d'Etta James et de Herbie Hancock...|`|dDgnVMWPaa	Ouais moi aussi j'ai adoré!!!|`|kvIKNcvgaa	J'aime bien la chanson "Hello".|`|mVD1eC5Naa	elle est devenue trop ...sophistiquée!!trop de battements de cils de doigt vers le coin de la bouche ...une vraie pouffe!!! on dirait mariah carey... en blonde!!!|`|0IxtLsg8aa	waw, j ai beaucoup aimé sa chanson "hurt", et "tell me" avc P.DIDDY|`|276d4873abcfc939cf5853ec25a589afaa	Je ne l'aime pas beaucoup mais je dois avouer ke ce qu'elle a fait m' a bluffé elle a vraiment reussi son pari c'est réussi|`|3bd5b0ea13c1581d658369ca7d9d7167aa	C'est une des plus grandes artistes actuelles ! Ses deux derniers albums sont sublimes et son concert à Bercy en décembre dernier était génial. Elle a une voix à faire palir les plus grands, et elle a appris à vraiment la contr?ler. Elle bosse comme une folle furieuse, elle fait des choix artistiques remarquables, sans céder aux sirènes des trucs commerciaux ! Elle est assurément là pour longtemps ! <br>  <br>  P.S. : J'espère que les prochains singles seront "Still Dirrty" et "Mercy On Me".|`|410b0b162dd50c8be02e83f3b5589d7caa	Sa reprise du rock fait bouger les armoires !|`|468a5e1719e13086dc2249a2c84b67d0aa	Bien gaulée (quoique un peu petite), mais *aucun* talent, et *aucune* classe.|`|PmPzD0FZaa	elle est belle et elle chante bien|`|X1Qdq4Qkaa	j'adore de trop!!lOol <br>  <br>  avant son nouvelle album "back to BASICc" je m'intéresser pas trop à elle! maintenant  j'adore !!!<br>  trop bien la chanson avec p.didy<br>  ps "hurt" c'est ma préferer|`|YXCSstxUaa	elle chante bien elle a du talent mais comme tt le monde c très commercial.En tt cas elle est mieux que Britney Spears.

1516959ce2d57bfc47bc7880655e0095aa	J'dois admettre que le rap fran?ais EST naze. Quand tu vois que Diam's est disque de platine...<br>  Aujourd'hui dans le rap fran?ais les rappeurs ne savent même pas parler, piquent les idées à leurs amis "ricains"- genre "faux son", meufs bien vulgaires en bikini, bling-bling "fa?on US", sapes comme les gars de là-bas, et les mots en anglais pour faire "plus vrai". Bon, j'caricature mais en gros c'est ?a. Après t'as Booba qui chante à la StarAc. Vive la crédibilité ! Même si le rap américain préfère de plus en plus exhiber sa richesse au lieu de dénoncer les conditions de vie des Afro-américains, je trouve qu'il vaut 10 000 fois plus le co?t d'être écouté ou acheté. Bref, après je ne sais pas s'ils prennent les Fran?ais pour des cons, mais ils sont pas mal non plus. L'identité, les "nique la France" tout ?a, ?a fait hard core, donc crédible ? Je sais pas. En tout cas, moi ?a m'a saoulé qu'ils se plaignent toujours sans jamais amener une note d'espoir.|`|Mo7EZzg4aa	c'est ?a restes en chien!!|`|W6rnW8QRaa	C'est sur que si tu te concentre sur les faux rappeurs écoutés à la radio tu auras toujours les même choses mais c'est valable pour tous les styles de musique commerciaux (chanson fran?aise, pop anglaise, techno...). <br>  A part Solaar est le plus commerciaux de tous, se faire composer ses musiques par Zdar et Boom Bass et se faire écrire ses textes par des auteurs de studios, surfer sur la vague Da vinci Code, se retrouver dans les tabloids, fiare des textes vide de sens depuis trois albums, c'est vachement underground...|`|f25b1bd340a6cb1dcc087ba3ff42e178aa	La sois-disante musique Rap n'est qu'une poubelle d'où ne sortent que des grossièretés et des injures envers les fran?ais...dans certains  pays (de leurs cousins lointains), les "rappeurs" seraient en prison !|`|xRaGyugTaa	oui c'est vrai|`|0debc1669ace77dfd1cdf4d881aa77dcaa	oui.......|`|2d31d749f3d44b1fcdecdb1b6d3a2e99aa	Heeeuuu! yooooooo!<br>  Ouais! malheureusement|`|2ub0TkUkaa	Si... C'est d'ailleurs dommage, cette musique qui vient a la base de la rue, vient aujourd'hui du supermarché, puisque c'est devenue purement commercial, du moins très souvent :-(<br>  Pour ma part j'ai du mal à comprendre comment certaines chansons ayant parfois pour texte un appel a la haine peuvent être diffusés en toute tranquillité... <br>  Au programme : Casser du flic (flic raciste forcément...), se plaindre parce que personne ne les aime, parce qu'ils ne se considerent pas comme Franais ou au contraire qu'ils sont aussi Fran?ais que n'importe quel autre citoyen (tout dépend du rappeur), etc...<br>  Sans parler des clips ! Montre en or, grosses voitures, habits de marque, filles dénudés, mais en même temps de plaindre de la vie trop chère, etc...<br>  Enfin dans la mesure ou c'est la mode, ceux qui en profitent le mieux sont les marques des vêtements portées par ces rappeurs !|`|UNHEfqrPaa	Ah la la ....<br>  les rappeurs!J'ai vraiment l'impression qu'ils profitent des médias pour vendre leur musique!<br>  C'est vrai, c'est tjs sarko, la cité....<br>  Seulement, il y en a tout de même qui se démarquent comme Mc solaar, un artiste que j'apprécie et qui n'a pas fait de son métier une industrie (en tout cas pas autant que certains...).|`|d47a9e97296ba1b163527e6b14281e00aa	les rappeurs essayent de donner leur point de vue mais personne ne les écoute alors ils repetent les memes choses mais avc des textes different on parle de sarko et de sa politique des problemes etc  il faut bien écouter les textes pour les comprendre<br>  en plus comme l'a dit killeurkilleur si t'aime pas n'ecoute pas c'est aussi simple|`|gkoO5AL9aa	Le rap est une culture de masse, elle ne peut donc être diversifiée puisqu'elle vise le plus de gens possible.<br>  Et le nivellement se fait par le bas , bien sur.|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	si t'aimes pas alors ecoutes pas ...aussi simple que ca...

61c93877f769b8b7caf7fbb97967d3a4aa	Moi pareil, seuls les deux jeunes étudiants en sport trouvent grace à mes yeux. Les autres, en particulier le couple avec la femme hystérique, les deux cousines marseillaises (je l'aurais bien frité celle-là avec son drapeau rouge), et les deux chefs d'entreprise (on se demande ce qu'ils foutent là ces deux-là, ils feraient mieux d'être au taf justement, quel patron prend un mois de vacances pour aller faire un jeu télé, avec ce qu'ils gagnent ils pourraient faire un trekking en Himalaya si ils ont envie d'aventure!!!). Enfin bref, j'avoue que je ne suis pas très tolérante, mais certains sont vraiment consternants!|`|XIR2rPGTaa	je regarde pas cette émission!|`|u7SEGECeaa	moi c'est la marseillaise d'un certain age qui m'a gonflé avec sa grande bouche ! elle a aucun respect !!!! elle ne sait pas parler juste crier sur tout se qui bouge !|`|xRaGyugTaa	oui j'ai déjà vu moi je ne supporte pas les deux cousines|`|9sn3XWrBaa	d'accord avec Emanuel , la femme du couple marseillais <br>  est vraiment insuportable , elle est impolie avec les gens qui la prenne en stop , elle hurle tout le temps , et ce croit en pays conquis . Je trouve que l'émission est un peu moins bien que l'année dernière , mais l'aventure reste un bel exploit pour les participants . Les 2 chefs d'entreprise sont effectivement crispant .|`|Qi4nIa9Vaa	Je partage ton avis ces types débarquent en plein milieu de l'aventure ils sont plus frais arrogants et raflent tout c'est scandaleux ils auraient dut avoir une forme de pénalité.<br>  Je soutiens les deux jeunes Thomas et Elie qui sont de vrais acharnés!!<br>  <br>  Je suis d'accord avec la réponse affirmant que les candidats sont très irrespectueux et vulgaire avec les autochtones notament le couple Tibert et Nicole qui vu leur age (ce qui n'excuse pas l'attitude des autres candidats) devraient  se montrer plus respectueux|`|UVtSbb4Uaa	2 chefs d'entreprises qui vont en chine ??? ils délocalisent ???|`|f93dbdf18e3e68e62235ad2ae29d6be1aa	moi j'aime bien! ils entrent en retard au jeu mais ils y entrent en force!! j'adore leur fa?on de jouer, ils ne s'engueulent pas et n'engueulent pas les autres.|`|vNG511khaa	J'ai découvert l'émission hier, et ils m'ont effectivement choqué, mais moins que le couple de petits vieux qui se fout littéralement de la g*eule du monde, se montre injurieux et irrespectueux, voire malhonnête. La scène avec le taxi m'a aussi interpelé, ces candidats devraient être sanctionnés voire éliminés. Ce jeu devrait aussi être un engagement moral au respect des coutumes de chacun.... Par contre, je ne suis pas choquée par le fait de manger du chien, pourtant je les adore, mais nous on mange bien du veau, du cheval, du kangourou, de l'autruche,des grenouilles et des escargots, alors on est tout aussi barbares!|`|29d518b84d3b747c4e6d00eb7e49bf94aa	non pas cette fois ci au bout de 2 emissions ?a m'a gonflé,trop d'impolitesse envers les habitants des pays étrangers et si les fran?ais se comportent tous comme ?a à l'étranger je comprends que ceux ci aient vraiment une tres mauvaise opinion de nous.|`|Cvq2lpEvaa	moi j ai asp regarde cette semaine je suis trop deg que le petit couple de la semaine derniere soit parti ..<br>  <br>  snif snif

Yo he pasado por una situacion similar y no logras entender como alguien te puede hacer a un lado de su vida cuando para ti sientes q es lo mas grande q te ha ocurrido... logicamente no te puedo dar una respuesta lo mas convincente porq estamos en las mismas. Lo q te puedo decir es q hay dos formas d amar... con el corazon y con la mente y logicamente cuando amas con el corazon sufres mas porq existe la discocion dentro de ti de saber q es lo correcto... si buscarlo porq tu corazon te lo pide a gritos o si dejarlo al olvido por habert lastimado. Es algo complicado porq solo uno sabe lo q siente en ese momento y no hay palabras suficientes q te convenzan de lo contrario.... Abrigate en tus amigos, es una buena opcion, y no busques eso de q un clavo saca a otro clavo porq solo da?arias a otra persona por estar con ella sin pensar en ella, no es justo!!! Trata de estar bien contigo y da tiempo.... alguien me dijo, q todo lo q haces en el amor sea bueno o malo se paga y tarde o temprano el te echara de menos.... Eso espero, pero si puedes y logras olvidarlo y comenzar de nuevo... FELICIDADES. un saludo y un abrazo...

l0cKdw3eaa	Pero no! My Chemical Romance no tiene nada de mensajes ocultos, leyendo una revista, me interesé en un reportaje a esa banda. Cuando le preguntaron (Al vocalista) si tenían mensajes ocultos, el reaccionó sorprendido y respondió:<br>  <br>  "Que las personas piensen lo que quieran, pero inventar que tenemos mensajes ocultos en nuestras canciones es de lo más loco. Son cosas que la gente dice y de boca a boca se trasmite hasta cierto punto. Creo que cualquier persona ve a un grupo como nosotros y sólo por las canciones de rock pesado, y nuestro aspecto, piensan que somos malas personas, mientras somos igual que ellos pero con una vida diferente, debida a la p*** fama."<br>  <br>  Realmente me sorprendió lo de p*** fama, jaja, pero bueno espero que te haya servido esa parte de la entrevista.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|Otdh4dJxaa	no digas tonterias>> ademas si las tuvieras nuestro cerebro no las captaria ya que ni tu ni yo hablamos ingles eso lo dicen porque es un nuevo genero de musica y ha pegado demasiado,,los indigentes piensan que porque han adquirido demasiado fama se deva a que mandan mensajes secretos  de ultratumba que no tiene nada que ver.|`|maqydgLuaa	todas las canciones de cualquier persona (que sea una buena cancion) tiene un mensaje subliminal, por no discriminar a MCR. solo basta ponerle atencion a la letra...... si crees que MCR es una banda gotica y q son mensajes del demonio..... vete al infierno, seguro dirian para ti<br>  suerte!|`|8ed0d9ee2ee48986c7d011b83069e2caaa	chale no espantes!!! mi hija los escucha muchoooo!!!|`|BBQY3JZ9aa	la verdad no se y si los tiene me da igual me encantan <br>  <br>  <br>  saludos

Tu y es enfermé en moyenne 3 h 30 par jour. Tu ne vas passer ta vie dans cette prison mentale. Tu vas pas laisser tous ces animateurs débiles t'avilir. La semaine sans télé, c'est l'occasion de briser la glace, de se libérer de cette machine à abrutir. Allez viens, on a une vie à vivre et un monde à transformer.<br>  <br>  N’oublions pas que notre premier environnement est notre mental. Si la télévision est polluante à fabriquer, à faire fonctionner, puis polluante comme déchet, elle est d’abord une terrible agression pour notre psychisme. Soir après soir, nous sommes assis durant de longues heures face à elle. Nous sommes hypnotisés par ces images qui scintillent. Ces mêmes images imprègnent nos cerveaux, uniformisent nos existences, nos connaissances, nos go?ts, nos désirs. Des animateurs-milliardaires avilissent notre humanité et tirent nos existences vers le bas. Des présentateurs nous bombardent d’informations parcellaires. Notre psychisme est submergé par les assauts de milliers d’images jouant avec notre sensibilité, manipulant notre affect. Des millions de spots publicitaires conditionnent notre inconscient et fa?onnent l’idéologie dominante de la télévision : celle de la société de consommation. Une idéologie où une fausse jouissance immédiate par la consommation prime sur toute volonté de sens. Une idéologie où l’apparence prime sur la pensée, le jeunisme sur la culture, le déracinement sur la filiation. Par nature, la télévision conduit à la passivité, donc à la soumission. Elle est le média de la communication superficielle, simplificatrice, n’acceptant que les discours binaires. Elle est l’outil de régression des masses dont ont besoin les publicitaires et les industriels pour réduire les êtres humains à l’état de consommateurs. La télévision est une drogue à l’égard de laquelle chacun s’emploie à masquer sa dépendance. Elle nous évite de réfléchir, de nous poser des questions existentielles, de nous retrouver face à nous-mêmes. à force de fuir dans cet écran, nous devenons incapables d’affronter la réalité. à force de bombardements d’images, notre capacité d’attention s’altère, notre imagination s’appauvrit et notre esprit critique s’épuise ; nous avons de plus en plus de mal à nous consacrer aux valeurs essentielles. Avec en moyenne 3 h 30 de télévision par jour et par Fran?ais, nous passons désormais plus d’heures à regarder des émissions sur la nature qu’à y vivre, plus de temps à rire des plaisanteries à la télévision qu’à plaisanter nous-mêmes, plus de temps à regarder des scènes simulées de sexualité qu’à faire l’amour. Après une journée de travail et plus de trois heures et demie devant le poste, le temps consacré à la vie sociale, civique ou à la création ne peut être que marginal, sinon inexistant. La critique de la télévision ne peut donc se limiter à son contenu et doit le dépasser pour s’interroger sur le média en tant que tel. Une semaine sans télé, c’est un temps pour créer, construire, apprendre, lire, réfléchir, se rencontrer et retrouver le go?t et le parfum de la VIE… éteignons le poste et la vie commencera.|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	oui moi je vais regarder, j'aime bien Alex...|`|1b6366cebcb3d3c18fbd085d64ed37d9aa	Moi, peut être, si j'ai le temps.|`|6df332708a24ef91ef0563d238213f3faa	je vais surement être devant la 6 ce soir !|`|7DpFkKPlaa	Pas moi, je suis actuellement devant mon ordi avec les Experts en fond.<br>  Désolée je ne pourrais pas donner mon avis|`|IrNsxzPXaa	Eh oh ?à va pas la tête?

92348dbe46087011fb2eba9587501850aa	Exactement, elle s'est fait violée par Cassidy, et c'est également ce dernier qui a fait sauter le bus car 2 de ses amis qui étaient dedans, voulaient raconter à tout le monde que leur entra?neur de base-ball (excuse mais j'ai oublié le bom) quand ils étaient plus jeunes avait abusé d'eux. Du coup il s'est vengé en faisant sauté le bus. Il a également placé une bombe dans l'avion qui ramenait son ancien entra?neur. Quand Veronica l'a affronté, Logan est arrivé, ils s'en sont sortis, Cassidy s'est alors jeté du haut de l'h?tel Neptune juste aprés avoir demandé à Logan et Veronica qu'est-ce qui pouvait bien le retenir dans cette ville. La société qu'il avait fait prospéré avec sa belle-mère, a gagné des millions et étant l'autre personne à avoir son nom sur cette entreprise, elle a héritée d'un joli pactol soit 8 millions de dollars il me semble. Voilà, j'espère que ce résumé fera l'affaire. Ah j'allais oublier, le père de Logan est sorti de prison :(|`|xRaGyugTaa	ben salut je vais te donner un site ou tu pourra voir cet épisode il est super ( le site et l épisode )<a href="http://gougoune90.myblog.fr/veronica-mars_cat7.html" rel="nofollow">http://gougoune90.myblog.fr/veronica-mar...</a> amuse toi bien|`|955d189d23b4ff354d3e38fd168d15e7aa	Winry a bien résumé, je compléterais avec:<br>  Le père de Logan a été assasiné par le responsable de la sécurité des entreprise Keane, sous ordre de Duncan, alors que celui ci passe des jours heureux sur une plage australienne avec sa fille (qui fait des patés de sable!!)<br>  <br>  Mais aussi, quand Cassidy se dirige vers le bord du toit, Logan tente de l'interrompre, en lui disant: Ne fais pas ?a!,<br>  Cassidy réponds: Donne moi une bonne raison!<br>  Logan ne réponds pas et Cassidy réponds: C'est bien ce que je pensais!!<br>  <br>  Mac était sur le point de coucher avec Cassidy, mais celui ci n'a pas pu, Au même moment Veronica avait envoyé un message à Mac, lui indiquant sa découverte, mais ce message a été lu par Cassidy, qui lui a demandé de rejoindre Mac sur le toit, d'où bagarre, révélations et suicide....<br>  <br>  Le violeur de gosse c'est le maire Woody! qui meurs dans l'avion qui le ramené de sa fuite, quand Cassidy fait péter l'avion, Véronica pense que son père est à l'intérieur, mais ouf, le shérif n'a pas voulu......

333RB4n4aa	I don't know whether you realize this or not, but every other question on P&S is about Paris Hilton going back to jail.  And asking questions about her via the internet is giving her attention of some sort.  I wish I wasn't answering this question because that means my attention has been drawn to someone's question about that drag on society.  She contributes absolutely nothing to decent intelligent society.  If it wasn't for her wealthy family she would be nothing.  She's not a big actor, although she was in the movie "House of Wax" where she got speared through the head by a metal pole.  Anyone who despises her should watch it.<br>  I'm so sick of hearing about her when there are much more important serious issues to be addressed in our society.<br>  Thanks for allowing me this opportunity to rant.|`|fbb3dceb5e3cd527fa32ab6bfab6248faa	I agree with you.|`|BvUmTlcaaa	Thank God the Judge sent her back to jail<br>  <br>  She did the crime and must do the time.

La atmósfera de urgencias, las tramas retorcidas pero sin llegar a necesitar un deus ex machina para resolverlas, los actores... En Espa?a TVE la programó en horarios imposibles y a menudo aleatorios y se la cargó.<br>  <br>  Después me quedaria con House (me cae gracioso el tipo, y además suelen hablar de enfermedades raras, como hacían en otra serie que puso tele5 pero no tenía ni la mitad de gracia) y finalmente con Grey's Anatomy (es un culebrón, pero me gusta en humor con que tratan la personalidad de los actores).<br>  <br>  Respecto de las espa?olas, de Médico de Familia vi dos o tres capítulos.

Empece a ver Greys y no me gusto, no se enfocan en el aspecto medico y el de los pacientes, es mas como una telenovela. Dr. House no la he visto, no puedo opinar.|`|Q4reZ259aa	dr house es la mejor serie de medico, que no es tan dramático y me gusta como muestra las enefermedades|`|YmxFtCnJaa	Er porque creo que es la más real|`|gSEBMn2gaa	para mi la mejor a sido grey|`|h3XhwKvJaa	Depende de cada uno.<br>  Si te gusta la serie médica más tirando a la ciencia y al diagnóstico, entonces Dr. House es lo que estás buscando.<br>  <br>  Si lo que querés ver es una serie acerca del drama y los dilemas éticos de la medicina, tenés que mirar ER.<br>  <br>  Y si lo que querés es un culebrón que lo único que tiene que ver con la medicina es que sucede adentro de un hospital, lo que tenés que hacer es ver Grey's Anatomy o Scrubs.<br>  <br>  Va según los gustos de cada uno, no hay una que sea mejor o peor que la otra. Y si me preguntás, a nivel personal prefiero Dr. House.|`|287838527c5fe580bfdaec42a413d337aa	tengo 3 series favoritas sobre medicos..<br>  la principal es SCRUBS<br>  despues le sigue GREY'S ANATOMY<br>  y me encanta dr. house...<br>  <br>  pero scrubs es la mejor..<br>  muchas risas :)|`|8e7e0abe42dd7bfe59bfa2d5f2cfc63daa	sin duda Dr. House, porque hace un enfoque de la práctica de la medicina no tan dramático como ER ni tan vanal como Grey`s anatomy. Además pienso que ya ER se pasó de tiempo y no saben que más poner, han desgastado los personajes y han cambiado tanto que ya casi ni recuerdo a los originales, sin contar con la crudeza que le han inyectado en los últimos capítulos para atraer la atención perdida. Por otro lado, Greys Anatomy, hace un paseo muy rasante por la medicina, dándole mas importancia y destacando demasiado la parte personal de los personajes, por lo tanto, creo que el equilibrio perfecto entre drama, acción, comedia y conocimientos médicos lo aporta Dr. House|`|Va4RzLYNaa	Desde que se fue Clooney ER no es lo mismo, a pesar de Noah. De las actuales me quedo con Grey, ese cirujano plástico esta ca?on, pero House tb me gusta.|`|f89553312032cb17c7c438d0eeafcb54aa	Definitivamente E.R. bueno auque nunca he visto grey,s anatomy

The man said 10 what, 10 weeks, 10 days, 10 months. <br>  Doctor: 10, 9, 8<br>  .................................<br>  <br>  A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. "I'm lost," said the man. "Can you put me up for the night?" <br>  "Certainly," the Chinese man said, "but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man." <br>  <br>  "Ok," said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. <br>  <br>  Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy. <br>  <br>  He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, "Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest." "Well, that's pretty crappy," he thought. "If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about." He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: "Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle." In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, "Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost." <br>  .................................<br>  <br>  A large, powerfully-built guy meets a woman at a bar. After a number of drinks, they agree to go back to his place. As they are making out in the bedroom, he stands up and starts to undress.<br>  <br>  After he takes his shirt off, he flexes his muscular arms and says, "See that, baby? That''s 1000 pounds of dynamite!" She begins to drool.<br>  <br>  The man drops his pants, strikes a bodybuilder''s pose, and says, referring to his bulging thighs, "See those, baby? That''s 1000 pounds of dynamite!" She is aching for action at this point.<br>  <br>  Finally, he drops his underpants, and after a quick glance, she grabs her purse and runs screaming to the front door.<br>  <br>  He catches her before she is able to leave and asks, "Why are you in such a hurry to go?"<br>  <br>  She replies, "With 2000 pounds of dynamite and such a short fuse, I was afraid you were about to blow!"<br>  .................................<br>  <br>  A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time. <br>  <br>  Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. <br>  <br>  At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. <br>  <br>  That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!" <br>  <br>  The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. <br>  <br>  A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. <br>  <br>  10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. <br>  <br>  Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."<br>  <br>  The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist." <br>  .................................<br>  A man goes to his doctor and says, ''Doctor, Doctor, please help me! I've got a problem.'' The doctor examines the man and finds the man has a red ring around his penis. The doctor gives him an ointment to rub on the problem area. <br>  ''It's all cleared up!'' the man reports when he returns. ''But what was that medication you gave me?'' <br>  <br>  ''Lipstick remover.'' <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have a good evening, and please leave a comment if you pick me as best answer. <br>  <br>  <br>  .................................<br>  <br>  <br>  It was thanks giving dinner and little johnny was watching his parents arguing calling eachother, "you b*tch, you B*stard!" <br>  <br>  Johnny asked, what does that mean?<br>  <br>  His parents replied, "Sweetie, that means ladies and gentle man" Satisfied with his answer he went to watch tv and went to the bathroom 5 minutes later and his dad was shaving and he accidentally cut his face<br>  <br>  "S*it!" Johnnys dad said. <br>  <br>  "Daddy what does that mean?" little johnny asked? <br>  <br>  "Johnny, thats the, uhh, brand of shaving cream I use!"<br>  <br>  Satisfied with his question he went downstairs and watched his mom prepare the turkey, she was taking the tempature when some grease splattered on her arm<br>  <br>  "F*ck" his mom shouted. <br>  <br>  "Mommy what does that mean" johnny asked<br>  <br>  "Oh, that means that I'm almost done preparing the turkey"<br>  <br>  an hour later the guest showed up at the door and johnny gretted them, he said<br>  <br>  "B*tches and B*stards, pleas wait while my dad's shaving with sh*t and my mom is f*cking the turkey!<br>  .................................<br>  Little johnny just got back from winter break and her teacher wanted to use fascinate in a sentence. the first kid said "i went to the zoo, it was fascinating!" the second kid said "i am going to see my new dog, it will be fascinating! and Johnny raised his hand. the teacher called on her hoping little johnny wont swear.

Then it was Mr. Rabbit's turn: "I wish I had a helmet." And he got it. "Your turn again," said the frog to Mr. Bear. "I wish everyone in this country was female!!" Mr. Bear cried. And so it was done. "I wish for a motorcycle," Mr. Rabbit said. Mr. Bear just laughed and laughed. "You fool," he said to Mr. Rabbit. "You get a crappy motorcycle and helmet, and I get to shag every beast in the country! Except my third and final wish is that EVERY SINGLE BEAR IN THE WORLD WAS FEMALE!" "Alright," said the frog--Mr. Bear's final 3 wishes were granted. "Last turn, Rabbit--make it a good one," warned the frog. Mr. Rabbit took this to heart and said, "I wish Mr. Bear was gay!"

lObEjUh1aa	not to put too fine a point on it, but maybe they keep their addresses private because they don't want to be overwhelmed with 1000s of emails from fans?<br>  <br>  not all celebs feel this way; i'm sure some love to read and respond to fanmail.  those who do probably have their email addresses published on their websites.<br>  <br>  for the rest, it may be best just to respect their privacy.|`|MyftVExCaa	Celebs emails are private for a reason.  If you would like to email a celebrity, google their name and go to their website.  You can usually leave a message there or you may get an email address.  That way you can contact them.  If you try any other way, it can be construed as stalking which is illegal.

TGp8u65xaa	Every genre so far has been made 'popular' by a certain generation. We have run out of instruments to explore their potential. People of today are huge on change, therefore they are hesitant to revert back to a genre that is associated with a somewhat recent generation. We must either create a new method of making music, or find a way to make an amazing hybrid. Music has also been dieing due to the unmonitored wilderness that the internet has become. When the second internet comes, people will be forced to buy music files, and a real criminal face will be put on music pirates.

According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they were hitchhiking through New York. [1] Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby, you're gonna die!". The incident made such an impact, Axl turned it into one of the most revered hard rock hits of all time. The eponymous line was also featured in the song "Underwater World" by the Finnish glam-rock band Hanoi Rocks, whom Rose has acknowledged as inspiration.<br>  <br>  While the New Brunswick incident inspired the lyrics, the song was written in Seattle, and described Los Angeles. In a 1988 interview with Hit Parader magazine, Rose stated, "I wrote the words in Seattle. It's a big city, but at the same time it's still a small city compared to L.A. and the things that you're gonna learn. It seemed a lot more rural up there. I just wrote how it looked to me. If someone comes to town and they want to find something, they can find whatever they want." [2]<br>  <br>  Another line, "I wanna watch you bleed" was originally written as an allusion to AC/DC's "If You Want Blood (You've Got It)", and that song's lyric "I want you to bleed for me," but Axl changed the lyrics about a week before recording because the timing of the revised lyric was better.|`|3UfKIi6Laa	the jungle will drive you to insanity

It’s like…It makes me feel alive, you know. It makes me feel human. The only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good. So I guess what I’m feeling is like a beautiful sadness." <br>                                     ~ Trey Parker and Matt Stone, South Park, Raisins, 2003|`|2b87997e3f85173b8cc70d6964f33da9aa	You can be stronger in the places that are broken....take it from me---it's true.|`|8c812c5e1155816ce1cc84eb4aa152e2aa	awesome.....<3|`|9da3c5ae568e2209e6a7cf3e2a26f38baa	croissant! =D|`|d1a122bf553a216763f42c7bdfffd457aa	Sadness demands a relief from its burden.

I know because it took me ten years to let go of my unrequited emotional baggage, but when it finally did release, I had new hope, new adventure, a whole new life ahead of me.

Au début, c'était formidable et réaliste. Cela ressemblait à une étude de caractères car quoi de plus disparate que la population d'un avion; beaucoup de gens qui dans l'ordinaire quotidien ne se seraient jamais rencontrer ou n'avaient pas vocation à se rencontrer du fait de leur appartenance sociale se retrouvent avec leurs forces leurs faiblesses et doivent gérer. Mais c'est devenu ensuite, un vrai délire et même les américains (de grand s enfants qui gobaient Dallas and Co) sont déboussolés et critiquent les rebondissements invraisemblables. Moi, j'ai laissé tomber Lost, d'autant que dans notre pays, avec l'accident de 2005, la diffusion a été longtemps interrompue. Depêche-toi d'en faire autant : raccroche ! Il y a tant d'autres émissions formidables. va sur "voyage" ; regarde les Pilots Guide, les trains pas comme les autres etc...

Cela dit il faut se prendre au jeu et se dire qu'on finira bien par avoir des réponses et que ce que nous pensons incohérent se révèlera par la suite tout à fait logique. <br>  Tiens d'ailleurs l'épisode 16 (ou 17 je sais plus) a été diffusé hier soir aux USA, vivement ce soir que je rentre pour regarder! eh oui moi aussi je suis accro|`|zNEA6LT9aa	Oui mais c'est ce qui fait le charme de cette série...S'il n' y avait pas autant de questions, je ne crois pas qu'on la regarderait!

AA11102397	ok... I think I figured it out.  The song is "South American Getaway" written by Burt Bacharach... performed by The Swingle Singers.|`|oh63c8hDaa	I'm such a film geek that I knew it the minute I saw the commercial.  First off, the song is from Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid with Paul Newman & Robert Redford.  I believe the name is South American Getaway...when they escape to Bolivia.<br>  The commercial has bits from all of the following films:<br>  Breakfast at Tiffany's<br>  Singing in the Rain<br>  Some Like it Hot<br>  The Birds<br>  Midnight Cowboy<br>  Easy Rider<br>  Say Anything<br>  Titanic<br>  and of course, Mary Poppins<br>  They're all great films if you haven't seen them...definitely rent them!  Oh, I just went back and checked and you can also see it on You Tube

e780daeebcd8c1306d972c70b1811da2aa	There really isn't much gore involved.  Just CGI blood thrown at the screen like a video game.  Nudity is present with two actual sex scenes, one with nudity, the other without.  This movie does not overdo violence, for at the time it represents how could it not be somewhat violent.  It's a great movie and is not in any way anti-persian.|`|103db20cde63fb559dce10f0f847fe1eaa	It has a ton of violence. Considering the amount of violence involved, there is minimal gore. There is blood but it's incredibly toned down from what it could have.<br>  <br>  There are many people (and sites) making a huge fuss about the "excessive" sex/nudity. I really think they saw a different film than everyone else did. In all honesty, it is fairly minimal compared to other films out there. There are a couple female nipple shots but they're blink and you miss them, posterior male nudity, a sex scene (more like a slideshow) with a married couple where you really don't see hardly anything, an "orgy" scene where all you see are two women kissing and not much more. There are also folks making a fuss over the rape scene but everything is off-camera so it's moot. Also there is a scene showing the aftermath of an ambushed village where many folks are claiming to see genitals and nipples in full view that no one with 20/20 or similar vision can see at all from their seat. At the same time, there are just as many who are offended by the topless male soldiers which is a hoot in itself. <br>  <br>  Excellent film but definitely not something to take any kids to see.|`|9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	Some sex and nudity, one extended sex scene between the king and queen, another where a nubile young oracle flashes her breasts and then gets "licked" by some deformed temple priest then a, pseudo sex scene where you know the queen's being, ahem, "used" by the scumbag politician but they don't really show anything.|`|9da3c5ae568e2209e6a7cf3e2a26f38baa	two....sex & violence....as w/ any epic film.<br>  <br>  sex- marital, orgy and forced<br>  <br>  violence- from start to finish, but since "300" more on cartoon-style CGI than realism, the gore/blood factor looks actually awesome & innovative<br>  <br>  "Spartans....what is your occupation?"|`|AA11547859	It's really really violent and there's like 3 sex scenes,but those 3 scenes don't last long.  The violence is throughout the movie though, since it's a war movie.  It's a really good movie, I saw it today.|`|AA11950231	expect blood thru the whole movie and sex screens are always necessary.|`|529bd7b0371d15d0ce8b0cc5f68a5eeaaa	It is violent, but it only has 2 sex scenes, 10 mins worth of nudity.

Better yet-- Get on the Concert Advisory Committee at your local College/University,  where you'll have some *real* input, and can then *learn how to promote your own show*, and then *network* with Booking Agencies, Managers and Bands. That's how most people who are in the Promotion business get started.<br>  <br>  Is your market viable for the sort of entertainment you want?The other option is find a backer or two, and open your own club and book the bands you can afford, make a profit, and save until you can book the band you want at a venue that will cover their fee and the venue fee, and hopefully a little left over for your staff and you.  <br>  <br>  Starting very small isn't *too* hard. Jumping to big-names is a lot harder. But it can be done-- it IS done. And you can do it too.<br>  <br>   You want a scene? Create it.  Start small, get Big.

1a33fd7efa7f9189d80064ebb85f2b4caa	Fui a Londres luego a Paris por tren y luego a Roma por avion....de todos el peor fue roma...En el tren (solo hay dos rutas) debes tener cuidado pues entra tanta gente tan pegada a ti que te roban la cartera (a mi esposo le paso) y fue una mujer embarazada..entro al tren, le robo la cartera y se salio antes de que el tren arrancara (eso es lo que sospechamos)....Los miercoles, hay audiencia con el papa, puedes tomar un tour que te lleva alla y puedes tener una audiencia con el...sino, llega temprano y parate en las vallas que hay que forman como una carreterita en la Plaza de San Pedro...Por alli pasara en el Papa movil y lo tendras cerca...La pizza es grasosa...me comi un pollo y me callo malisimo...si vas al vaticano,lleva un id (no una copia) porque si lo que llevas es una copia del pasaporte o del id no te alquilan los audifonos para seguir el 'tour'  y entender lo que estas viendo... (lleve copia porque nos robaron la cartera y no queriamos arriesgarnos a que nos robaran el pasaporte)...si vas al Coliseo y te retratas con personas disfrasadas de gladiadores y guardias romanos, lleva buen dinero para la propina porque si le das una cantidad modica te la critican y te dicen que eso no vale nada que les des mas...|`|kwz9mceYaa	Me voy a ir a Roma este Julio para mis quinces.

bgohEtTbaa	Some action figures (like Transformers) will sometimes include these really thin clear rubber bands.  On my Marvel Legends, I usually just try to put those into the joints to make them tighter while still allowing the joint to move and the rubber bands are hard to see, or hidden completely if they fit all the way in there.

eEWnNqXqaa	It depends on if you are a boy or a girl and what kinda budget you are working with. I would steal ideas from the show Super Sweet Sixteen on MTV, those are always cute and fun. Like that girl who had the skateboard sixteen mixed with a sort of 80s vibe, that looked fun! Or take a movie, era, song, or hobby that you like and elaborate on it to make ideas for your party.

lafYmseUaa	I just listened.  You guys have pretty good music.  My only tip is you should practice a little more and stay together more :-)|`|f70a060e0c73b826dbd3b26e0166429caa	who's "conterfiet holiday"? you should go on a tour and make albums and ask radios to play it so people know about them.|`|uGEDwuwbaa	The music is good, if a  little off balance.<br>  It gets a little heavy for your singer to be able to keep his head above water. Turn him up and the music down just a tad, and you should be ok... <br>  Other than that...<br>  I really did like it. I can't decide just who you sound like, but I think I heard a little Lacuna Coil influence in there. (And that is a good thing!)

Juanes no llega ni a rock Mana es rock pop, al igual que juanes, heroes si es rock, pero un tipo rock alternativo...|`|i4yCtOHXaa	Heroes del Silencio es el mejor grupo que ha dao Espa?a en muchos a?os. Nadie ha hecho por el momento un tipo de musica que se les parezca. Son unicos.<br>  <br>  Respecto a Manà: a mi no me gustan , aunque respeto que cada uno escuche la musica que quiera... pero rock, evidentemente no es, es un pop-rock, en todo caso.<br>  <br>  Yo tambien me pongo de mal humor cuando digo: me gustan los ACDC y me responden: entonces te gusta el heavy? . Pues si, pero  ADCD, son puro rock. Son la esencia del rock. Si no, que escuchen Thunderstruck, Who made Who o Whole lotta Rossie, a ver si les suena heavy.<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|rVR4p8Uhaa	heroes del silencio lo comparas con maná,es que no tienen mucho que ver salvo que cantan en castellano,prefiero marea,skp y mago<br>  Saludos

AA11546607	Apparently she got out of jail because of mental issues, her psychiatrist said she was depressed and could commit suicide. Her parents just paid off a psychiatrist to write a letter to the judge so she'd get out, plain and simple.|`|233a46d941cc4dc96f2ee231b8a539f7aa	huh, i thought she escaped|`|b3619d42ae8bd30f7f3e32139d63e51daa	I do not think she was sick at all.|`|kpFCFDbjaa	She was sick alright,  sick of being with common people.|`|mfigifRBaa	I think it's a big huge smelly load of crap.

LYF3GUPKaa	It's like the difference between VHS tapes and DVD, normal film prints can become scratched or worn out after time (or by Projectionist error). Digital Projection means that no matter how long the film has been playing, the print is as good as the day it was first shown. <br>  The images are also much clearer than normal 35mm.<br>  <br>  Digital Projection also allows special effects to be added to the print such as the recent re-release of Nightmare Before Christmas 3-D which was a digital only release.<br>  <br>  It is also much cheaper for the distributors to release films on a digital format. An average 35mm print of a film is over 6ft in diameter (i have no idea how long the average film print is but your talking miles not meters) , and therefore expensive to produce. A digital film is stored on single or multiple DVDs and therefore is much cheaper and better for the environment to produce.<br>  <br>  Digital Cinema will become the industry standard one day much as DVD has become the home entertainment standard or Digital TV will replace analoge|`|qNvPOWymaa	A normal projector uses a copy of the film on traditional film stock run through a projector. A digital projector uses a copy of the film stored on a hard drive.

They could have recorded those themselves. They could have had a sound effects disc and taken it from that. Most likely they probably found the sound on the internet.

Pl9ny15faa	I just watched that today.  I think it's racist too!!  She should have said you are a beautiful woman.  She offended people that take it seriously.  If you want to talk.. email me.<br>  <br>  Kalli_Lyn_XO@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  :]|`|8c5d4db36e1b3857d9ce99cb749ea0b0aa	I dont know, Monique is a f`cked up comedian, she does her things in a different way, Shay and Larissa are just some weird girl though. Monique is weird though, good point|`|b4393f613d9e1d30242a30d96bd44b12aa	No, she's trying to let those girls understand through self love. What I mean by self love is that Mo'nique is trying to get them to love themselves as beautiful black women first. She wants them to understand that some black/hispanic people find it embarassing because they're acting like that on T.V. She was right when she said "America is laughing at you, not with you." Monique has been calling everyone sistah (all colors of women) for years. It's not racist, it's all about self love.|`|524d6c9828d03d281050bda829ed89c0aa	It's not racist at all. It's just Mo'nique's way of representing her culture. Besides, how can it be racist and she's blacker than anyone?<br>  <br>  You must know Mo'Nique to know her personality. She wasn't beign racist though, just stating the obvious.|`|AA11445457	she is beautiful.
uZf8F6xTaa	"Refugee" by Tribal Ink <br>  <br>  You can listen to it here: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIhdGl5kaSY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIhdGl5ka...</a><br>  <br>  =)|`|U4r8JPl4aa	I was given this song my a friend who downloaded a "Linkin Park CD Leak" from their new album "Minutes to Midnight" It was labeled "Linkin Park - What I've Done" but that song's lyrics are NOT the lyrics of the song i have. I really like the song, even though it was cheaply mislabeled and  badly distrubuted. its actually a song of tribal ink , title is Refugee. Tribal Ink is a Alternative rock band from Sweden.Their song "Refugee" was mislabeled as Linkin Park's new single "What I've Done" on many P2P sharing sites.
e3mf7sw6aa	The theme song from the original Amityville Horror freaks me out.|`|AA10850259	Haunted house music like "Dance Macabre" by French composer Camille Saint Saens and "Totentanz" (Dance of Death) by composer Franz Liszt.|`|t40OmB7Aaa	I think country music is scary|`|kZHJ8lhdaa	"Weird" -  theme from the television show "One Step Beyond"|`|VzTuvdgwaa	Bad Moon Rising......it reminds me of the movie...American Werewolf in London....seen it when I was a kid and never liked the song since.

AA10823959	Basically, if Optimus placed the cube in his spark, then Megatron couldn't get his hands on it, ending his quest of conquest for sure.|`|35e05891dcc2b81d730923a4a3cd8210aa	Here's my question:<br>  Why make Sam hold the cube and parade across the street with it, risking EVERYBODY'S lives, the fate of the universe, dropping the cube and creating new transformers, when Optimus could've simply picked Sam and cube up (or better yet JUST the cube) and place it on top of the building?|`|7cXJrP6Saa	I think the reason why the Decpticons were destroying every thing was to find the Allspark thingy. If Optimus were to sacrafice himself, everybody would just have to hope that the evil killing robots would leave because they would have no reason to be there anymore. It might kill Megatron too, who knows. But you cant go back in time to see what would have happened. Who knows. I geuss thats one of the things about good movies...they always leave you wondering.  ;)
AA12296157	You sound more like the Virgo.  I think you assumed too much without realizing what his wants and needs were.  Most people don't just stop acknowledging someone for no reason.  Maybe his new Scorpio girlfriend told him she'd kill him if he so much as looked at you.  You know how possessive and protective you chicks are about your boyfriends.|`|GntonLeQaa	He's interested in someone else....don't let him put you on a shelf....move on.|`|981fd0d39431dc2d8f55c5b3a83869d4aa	he doesnt like you.. move on

I don't even think he's my bf anymore. so i hop in the car with her a little shaken up and my dad just kind of apears in the car, and sits in the front seat. As we're driving, i see a foot sticking up and out from under the seat, and i get REALLY scared and i scream dad, look! And dad looks at it, laughs, grabs it, tickles it, it's 'ned' and he laughs and he said something and dad laughed. then he jumped out of the car. Then wat seemed like 3 hours later we're still driving and theres cops, we tell them about it, me and stepmom go home while dad stays to talk to them and at home we're sitting on our couch, but it's not ours, and the guy comes in and we start screaming and screaming, and somehow dad apears, and the guy starts to strangle dad with toilet paper, then susan, and im screaming and crying and begging him to let me go and he laughs. then i woke up. I started bawling and i ran down to talk to my friends, and my loud crying woke my dad up, and he managed to console me, saying that my im still alive and 14.

2088750e2e24db94af84bd0688460755aa	Contrary to popular belief, no, Rose and "Sharon" are not dead. They're still in Alessa's alternate dimension, while Christopher (Rose's husband) is in the real world. Here's the deal...<br>  <br>  There are three parts of Alessa:<br>  <br>  - Alessa (the original body)<br>  <br>  - Sharon (Alessa's good side)<br>  <br>  - Dark Alessa (Alessa's evil side)<br>  <br>  Sharon and Dark Alessa are basically physical manifestations of the two sides of Alessa - the good side and the evil side. As for how Alessa created these physical manifestations (and the alternate dimensions), it can only be assumed that she possessed some kind of supernatural power (which in addition to the fact that she had no father, would obviously lead everyone associated with the cult to call her a witch). That being the case, this is what happened:<br>  <br>  1) Dark Alessa does not, in fact, take over or possess Sharon. Dark Alessa (the evil side) simply recombines with Sharon (the good side), creating a new and complete "reincarnated" Alessa.<br>  <br>  2) Alessa's pact with her evil counterpart not only ensures that she will help her exact her revenge, but that Alessa, after making herself "whole" again, will also be granted a new life with a better mother: Rose.<br>  <br>  3) And as for the ending:<br>  <br>  Alessa's plan works -she gets her much deserved revenge on the cultists, Dark Alessa and Sharon recombine and create a newly "reborn" Alessa, and she ends up with Rose (who either isn't aware or just doesn't care that this little girl isn't her Sharon anymore) as her new mother. Now with Sharon's memories to work with after reuniting her two halves, Alessa can extend her alternate dimension and create a world just like the one Sharon and Rose lived in, where they can stay forever. In other words, Alessa doesn't want them to leave her alternate dimension and in her eyes, for good reason. The real world is where Alessa was hurt, abused and humiliated. In the real world, she felt unsafe, unloved and that the people are untrustworthy (especially men, considering that the absence of her father - assuming he even existed - was the source of her torment, in addition to her horrific experience with the school janitor). Alessa wants to live out the rest of her new life with her new loving mommy in her alternate dimension, where she's in control and she feels safe. However, this is also how Dahlia's warning to Rose, "Be careful what you choose," comes to pass. Unfortunately for Rose, this end result means that she is essentially trapped in Alessa's alternate dimension indefinitely.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  :)|`|87b2f8ae49f1453d1bbbef16ce9e9a81aa	thier ghost, they died, that was purgatory, which means that purgatory is just a place, and heaven is where you make it,|`|SIvGbMClaa	they're dead. The fog and phone crackling symbolize the gap between their realities.|`|qNvPOWymaa	Rose is (or Alessa, who now posses Sharon's body, chose her to remain) trapped in the world of grey Silent Hill, which was a dimension created by Alessa to imprison and punish the cult that burned her, and to which she dragged Rose and her daughter in to. So yes, she is in a different world.<br>  <br>  The original game and its sequels explains the whole dimensional aspect of the story, which the movie does not do very well. ANY EXPLANATION INVOLVING THEM BEING DEAD IS INCORRECT.|`|uKsx0dt2aa	They were killed along with the cop when they crashed going up to "Silent Hill". All the scenes at Silent Hill were them in a sort of purgatory yes but they were able to escape it and they were able to get as close to home as they would ever be.

qNvPOWymaa	It's about the survivor of a plague which has the turned the rest of humanity into quasi-vampires. He spends his days wandering the streets, killing all those he could find, and spends his nights fighting them off as they lay siege to his fortified house.<br>  <br>  It's based on a book by the same name, and has been adapted into films twice before.
mWGOapt0aa	para mi que si es una pelicula que tiene todos los elementos para serlo|`|pA2dcZNKaa	Un requisito primordial para ser un zombi es morir y luego resucitar, o sea de esto trata la peli, entonces se cumple con la primera instancia, a pesar de q todas las demas caracteristicas no esten presentes en la peli, yo si defino a esta como una peli con zombi no de zombis.|`|qwTxfKbTaa	Si es de muertos vivos y se escribe sementerio ya que en el libro de stephen king era un cartel escrito por ni?os y tenia errores de ortografía,siempre es un placer contestar su preguntas Meteoro muy friend!.|`|td1itTtIaa	No. No cumple los requisitos. Si, hay muertos vivientes, zombies, esto no lo hace una pelicula de zombies. El cine de zombies juega con un miedo muy arraigado en el ser humano, mas  que el miedo a los zombies es el miedo a que termine la civilizacion. A perder la cordura. A quedarnos solos en el mundo. Finalmente es el miedo a perder nuestra humanidad, volver a ser bestias.<br>  Por otro lado en el concepto original del cine de zombies (ojo, no estoy hablando de la descripcion de la religion voodoo) el zombie contagia o infecta a cualquiera que ataque (con una mordida, tradicionalmente) cosa que  no sucede en Cementerio Maldito.|`|bwTgox0gaa	En mi opinión si, la definición de zombie es clara: Un cuerpo sin alma que ha sido vuelto a la vida (despues de perder esa alma) a travez de magia negra. Exactamente lo que pasa en la peli, solo que con el instrumento del cementerio. En mi opinión es la mas fiel a la concepción real de zombies. Las otras en las que la culpa la tiene un experimento son mas fantasiosas.|`|8d3ed28b66d380ecd31f00acd0b0e64aaa	Si, realmente la pelicula trata el tema zombi, puesto<br>  que se trata de muertos que fueron revividos, y en el<br>  diccionario dice que zombi es un muerto vivo, esta claro!!|`|xqX5EeW1aa	si

Toujours en train de raler ou de chercher les emmerdes. <br>  C'est vrai qu'on s'attendait tous à une émission un peu plus "serieuse" et professionnelle !<br>  Mais bon que voulez vous, c'est ?a les émissions d'aujourd'hui !!!!|`|O1JDvjhcaa	Entierement d'accord avec toi. On dirait meme des sketches parfois, ces filles sont vraiment insupportables pour la majorité. L'émission est bidon car on ne voit jamais les jugements des profs, on les entensd mais on ne voit pas à qui ils correspondent. Bref on nous prend pour des cons.... <br>  <br>  L'autre hybryde de Jean Dujardin dans 99 F et du vrai Beigbeider, à savoir le Be,njamin est puant... et jhe pèse mes mots. C'est li qu'il faut virer!!!!!|`|V6mtSJV1aa	?a m'arrive de regarder mais à chaque fois, je me marre de voir à quel point elles sont connes...

qNvPOWymaa	The director of Superman I, Richard Donner, was fired by the film's producers during filming of Superman II. This upset Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder to the extent that Hackman refused to shoot extra scenes for Superman II., and did not sign on for  Superman III.<br>  <br>  While Margot Kidder does appear in Superman II, her role is very small. Most say it was in retaliation over her view of Donner's firing, but the producer claims that they just wanted to explore Superman's relationship with Lana Lang.

k0noyZFZaa	je suis une fidèle d'urgence depuis les débuts, les scénaristes ne nous ont pas épargné en 13 saisons, mais le dernier épisode là je dois dire que c'est trop... l'image de ray au bout du couloir blanc, son regard, la chaise roulante et la découverte de sa double amputation : je ne sais pas pourquoi mais je ne m'en remet pas. super réalisation, pendant quelques instant, j'ai cru à une amnésie ou à des séquelles neurologique, et le fauteuil pivote et ... aaaaargh. j'en suis vraiment toute retournée.<br>  d'autant que les autres personnages ne nous laissent pas beaucoup d'espoir... lukas va refaire qq apparitions en saison 14 mais il n'en a plus pour longtemps et cela m'étonnerait que neela sorte indemne de son petit bain de foule. <br>  en bref, si les scénaristes nous laissent en plan avec archie et hope (bof bof) d'un coté et la gueguerre pratt-tony de l'autre (tony qui commence sérieusement à m'énerver d'ailleurs), la saison 14 s'annonce bien fade... a moins d'une miracle (le retour de carter par exemple !).|`|371618e8cf02f3952686587d5584f6f5aa	beaucoup de déceptions, de questions laissées en suspens avec ce final<br>  Qu'est-ce-qui leur a pris de faire ?a à Ray???<br>  Franchement, c'est ignoble, je m'en suis pas remise.<br>  Après, le départ de Luka est, il est vrai, assez étrange. Je ne sais pas comment ils vont justifiés qu'il ne reviendra pas, parce que Abby est toujours là : alors il va lui arriver quoi à lui??<br>  <br>  Nan, c'est du n'importe quoi ce finish.<br>  Et pour Neela, c'est une porte ouverte à de nouveaux dégats.<br>  <br>  <br>  Franchement les scénaristes, je ne vous tire pas mon chapeau!|`|72a6206ce6542113a17415aac2f8f2e0aa	oh mon dieu.....j'étais sur le c..... c'est la poisse tout ?a...le premier épisode super émouvant mais alors la fin snif snif c'est pas juuuste !!! Et dire qu'on va encore poireauter pour voir la suite....|`|7df1caf138a44537f153f6ea90ae615aaa	J'ai bien aimé le mariage d'Abby et surtout tout les sujets différents que les urgences abordent... Ce qui m'a beaucoup plu aussi est le personnage de Neela qui, lors du mariage, découvre que 4 personnes sont amoureuses d'elle. Ce qui est dramatique, en revanche, c'est l'accident de Ray. C'est un coup dur pour nous et Neela. (il ne n'apparaitra plus dans les prochains épisodes ou à de très rares occasions.)<br>  <br>  Franchement, j'ai adoré cette saison comme j'ai adoré les autres. Cette série ne vielli pas! je suis impatiente de voir la suite|`|911g16XEaa	?a sent la grande braderie avant la fermeture définitive...<br>  <br>  On expédie le mariage d'Abby et Lucas avant de faire surgir un père malade (pas vu en 7 saisons) pour l'envoyer en croatie<br>  <br>  On évacue ce qu'il restait de personnages intermédiaires (entre urgences d'origine et nouvelle urgences) des manières les plus atroces: Ray charcuté, Neela piétinée<br>  <br>  On introduit un nouveau chef tatillon (et chauve par tradition) pour tenter de relancer le shmilblick<br>  <br>  On raffraichit le décor d'un coup de peinture en espérant que donner un coup de jeun's sauvera la prochaine saison<br>  <br>  On utilise la symbolique de la guerre et du film du mariage  pour pleurer les docs tombés "au combat " et qui ne reviendront pas <br>  <br>  Grand merci quand même pour  le superbe "hallelujah" chanté par jeff buckley|`|JvZWWVrKaa	ah,il faut que ?a s'arrête,c'est nul de faire comme ?a dans le drame sans modération<br>  ce qu'ils ont fait à ray m'a choqué dans tous les sens du terme...et puis kovac qui s'en va (encore un autre acteur principale qui se tire...à mon avis c'est celui de trop)à peine après le mariage et on lui cherche un remplacent le nouveau chef de service qui va sauver le monde et conquérir abbie qui va bien sure réussir à supporter l'abandon de son mari(qui sera certe très mal justifié vu l'attachement de kovac à sa petite famille)<br>  Ray...que c'est moche!<br>  Gates et sa Sarah,bataille juridique,je me demande qui gagnera?(je l'aime pas celui là)et puis tous les autres...la fusillade...j'ai envie de hurler rien qu'en y repensant<br>  bref,c'était une horreur,?a m'a écoeurée et je suis vraiment dé?ue,en colère et fatiguée de leur histoires à la con,même pas crédibles,dont le seul but et de nous garder pour la prochaine saison...c'est pas grand chose mais moi ils m'ont perdus!<br>  assez!|`|d7361f94dbb8b536d27f4c46d3d59656aa	Bien mais j'étais dé?ue pour Ray...juste quand Neela l'avait choisie,il se casse de la série...<br>  Je viens en plus d'apprendre par vous que Luka ne revenait pas...je suis encore plus dégoutée...Mais vivement la prochaine saison quand même!!!|`|xRaGyugTaa	ben moi j ai pas vu le final mais hier j ai vu est ce que l'autre va mourir (shane west) ????? oui ou non moi je viens de commencer a voir la série|`|mj0fSfk5aa	Au pour ray c'était le choc mais comment ils ont fait pour ses jambes ?a semblait vachement réaliste.<br>  <br>  En tt cas j'ai hate d'être à la saison 14.<br>   <br>  Je l'aime bien le nouveau boss des urgences il remet un peu de vie<br>  <br>  retour de kovach ou pas ?<br>  a quand la saison 14 ?|`|RVr3K5CTaa	En fait, le vrai final c'est la fermeture des Urgences, ensuite on a 3 épisodes de transition (la saison 13 a si bien marché, que la chaine a commandé 3 épisodes de plus) avec la saison 14.<br>  J'aime beaucoup le nouveau chef des Urgences. Depuis Kerry, il n'y en avait eu aucun de valable capable de rivaliser avec Mark, pour le charisme. Là, c'est prometteur.<br>  <br>  Je me demande comment la confrontation entre Moretti et Carter va se passer (puisque le personnage revient pour 5 épisodes au moins dans la saison 14)<br>  <br>  Ensuite, on a un nouveau départ pour beaucoup<br>  - Gates redevient célibataire sans enfant<br>  - Abby est de nouveau seule mais joue le role de "la mère isolée" (puisque Sam ne l'est plus) qu'il y a en permanence depuis pas mal de saisons (?a a du commencé avec Carol)<br>  - Ray disparait (bien qu'il reviendra un peu dans la saison 14)<br>  - Kovac est parti (mais revient dans quelques épisodes de la saison 14)<br>  - Neela, je doute qu'il lui arrive quelque chose de grave mais c'est aussi un renouveau : elle a fait la paix avec son passé, son mariage avec Michael. Va-t-elle succomber à son patron ? :)<br>  <br>  Belle saison, la meilleure depuis plusieurs années, et un beau final bien que trop dramatique (Urgences normalement ne faisait pas ?a.

Carter il est parti à l'étranger, Mark il est mort........... lui il va soigner son père qui ne va quand même pas être indéfiniment malade! sans compter qu'il y a Abby et Joe.. mais bon.. on verra dans la saison 14 comment ils gèrent son départ..|`|d77d858bec2f3896f3701e9281a70a44aa	C'est trop triste en ce qui concerne Ray, je me demande comment ils ont fait pour ses jambes (effets spéciaux ???), je suis triste que Kovac soit parti aussi (il ne sera pas très présent dans la saison 14, Ray non plus d'ailleurs).

0ba8c5107649cf6c164cda5bf5ca5198aa	In the books, Rowling does seem to suggest that lack of a loving father from babyhood plays a large part in the development of Voldy's evil. <br>  <br>  Harry had a strong, protective, loving father for the first 15 months of his life, and that formative experience seems to stopped him from becoming bitter and resentful, even after years of abuse and neglect - Voldemort, on the other hand, was treated well at the orphanage.<br>  <br>  However, it does seem that Voldemort's maternal family had a streak of insanity, while his paternal family were naturally selfish, cold and cruel.

I was going to give some answer on the level of "because he has a twisted mind," but that doesn't cut it for a question like this. There might be a reason. I wonder what it is? Maybe he just always hated/resented the parents that, to his thinking, gave him up and didn't care about him. Which means lots of pent-up anger and nothing to take it out on... but pretty soon the other children became the victims, I suppose. And I guess he never got rid of the anger, and moved from scaring children to terrorizing the wizarding world. I can't think of any other reason why he would do it.<br>  <br>  Oh, wait! Yes I can! It's because he's so ugly, and he is paranoid that everyone thinks he is ugly (but he's right, they do) and takes it out on everyone! But that's sort of specific to the movies where they did their best to make him look nasty (including not giving him a nose).|`|oHSSRAOoaa	Ermmm    we don't get books here, but I thought Dumbledore was dead?|`|XkDEls9Vaa	well....i've read the book and it's very interesting.....but i have no ideea why is he so evil.......i think con his past,parents.....those things make him evil.....i can't wait the 7 book:)

You get what ever you like the best, and a woman with brains is not intimidating, as long as she doesn't  try to impress everyone with her knowledge.

5D0hsIcEaa	Hola!!<br>  <br>  El colaborador destacado participa activamente en una categoria dando siempre buenas respuestas y logrando tener las mejores.<br>  No es necesario reunir una gran cantidad de puntos para ser un colaborador destacado, lo que se requiere es continuidad, según sé, es necesario que participes en una sola categoría, es decir que estés activo preguntando y respondiendo y hacer que tus respuestas sean elegidas como las mejores, de ese modo es posible que llegues a serlo.<br>  <br>  Otra cosa: el letrero de colaborador destacado no es permanente, (me parece que lo actualizan cada lunes) si dejas de participar activamente y de obtener mejores respuestas en la categoría en que te lo dieron, entonces desaparece. Por eso es necesario que participes mucho en una sola categoria y des buenas respuestas en la misma, aunque puedes ser colaborador destacado hasta en tres categorías. Pero no siempre es así, muchas veces son muy parciales con respecto a quien le ddan el cartelito .... <br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|2349ba91b815c3c12cf736c03dec01c5aa	quien sabe yo soy lider de categoria en playstation y no me han dado el letrero de colaborador destacado, a lo mejor si es tener determinado numero de mejores respuestas en una misma categoria.|`|OiYmUSE8aa	Hola, acá Linda ya nos ha explicado a qué se debe, a mí me apareció de pronto sin esperarlo, y así de pronto desaparecerá por las preguntas que he visto, que dicen que se lo quitan, yo sigo preguntando cuando tengo ganas y respondiendo las preguntas que me gustan.

TpJgnj3Qaa	Ma foi, pas totalement inattendu, c'était parmi les possibles titres qui circulaient depuis pas mal de temps sur le net.<br>  Peut-être moins "mystérieux" que le titre anglais, encore que le c?té mystérieux de ce dernier vient peut-être du fait qu'il soit justement en anglais donc qui ne nous permet pas de comprendre spontanément (du moins pour moi)<br>  C'est vrai qu'avec ce titre, on voit bien à quoi il est fait allusion (assez évident, ces fameuses "reliques", non ?)<br>  <br>  Cependant, je ne saurais pas trop quel titre j'aurais préféré, qu'est ce qui aurait fait plus "mystérieux". <br>  Je me contente assez bien de celui-ci parce qu'à la limite, je dirais que cela n'est pas si important que ?à, du moment que le livre est bien<br>   De plus, il me semble avoir lu quelque part, que le titre n'est pas nécessairement définitif...<br>  <br>  Enfin, de toutes fa?on, j'attends surtout avec impatience l'arrivée du bouquin (en VO) dans ma boite aux lettres...

FIEoY86gaa	Heroes est pour moi l'une des meilleures séries que j'ai jamais vu et adoré. J'adore le c?té humain de cette série|`|a638ccd3a1d568168e86c642f6e76791aa	dans l'ordre de mes preferences je mettrai  lost-heroes-prison break|`|e0c15f27d68563a63617d07ea8a45b52aa	je ne dirais pas excatement comme toi, je dirais que c'est l'unes des meilleures séries du moment, avec lost, prison break ...<br>  ces trois séries sont totalement différentes, difficle de les comparer ... mais perso je les adore toutes les trois !!!|`|xRaGyugTaa	je ne suis pas d'accord avec toi sur une chose , prison break c'est une histoire réelle et heros c'est une imaginaire mais elle est bien|`|0EWS7BSyaa	pomper sur les xmen en moins bien ,j ai vu la premiere saison,j ai trouvé ca ennuyeux,aucune originalité pas de suspens bref du deja vu ,contrairement  a lost qui tient en haleine et qui je trouve est une serie originale.|`|6b6a904cb8756df8a49e314aef2b005aaa	Je trouve cette série super, et j'adore <br>  Par contre Prison break c'est super aussi différente de Heros|`|8e31f8d1cc143ddb93afe1ac7bad9c8faa	oui mais on a parfois l'impression de voir un remake des x-men!<br>  <br>  bref une très bonne série, manque un peu d'originalité.|`|C9EXMtkwaa	Pour moi la meilleure série du moment c'est Lost. La plus originale, et la plus novatrice.<br>  Pour Heroes, on prend l'histoire de super-héros des 4400, le mode narratif de Lost (plusieurs r?les principaux), on y ajoute une dose de fin du monde à la Alias, une bonne bande son, de bons acteurs et on obtient ce que tout le monde considère comme la meilleure série depuis longtemps.<br>  Je la regarde aussi et la trouve intéressante (bien qu'avec de nombreuses longueurs) mais il n'y a absolument rien de novateur dans Heroes.|`|WlhyqWqeaa	oui  je suis d'accord avec toi a 200 pour 100|`|bXWqLzqZaa	pas + que prison break mais je l'aime aussi|`|qCI9fCSHaa	bien|`|5bc7c7aec5b4279ab9498640fb6037aaaa	a) Je flane, certes!

(*) !<br>  Quatre jeunes dipl?més de quatre grandes universités Yale, Harvard, la Sorbonne et Padoue, postulent pour un emploi au sein d'une multinationale dont le siège se trouve au Brésil. Les quatre candidats furent convoqués ensemble par le directeur général de la société qui leur dit :<br>  Je vais vous poser une seule question, et selon votre réponse le poste sera pour vous. La question est : Quelle est la chose la plus rapide du monde ? Le candidat de Yale répond :<br>  Une pensée. Le directeur :<br>  Pourquoi ?<br>  Parce qu'une pensée est presque immédiate. Le directeur pensa que la réponse était excellente. Le candidat de Harvard répond :<br>  Un battement de cils, car c'est tellement rapide qu'on ne s'en aper?oit même pas. Le directeur est ravi. Le candidat de la Sorbonne répond :<br>  Le courant électrique, car en d'une seule pression sur un interrupteur on fait appara?tre la lumière à 5 km de distance. Excellent pense le directeur. Puis vient la réponse du candidat de Padoue :<br>  C'est la diarrhée !<br>  Pardon, vous plaisantez, qu'avez-vous dit ? s'écrie le directeur.<br>  Non c'est la diarrhée... cette nuit j'ai eu une diarrhée si forte qu'avant de pouvoir penser à battre un cil et sans même me donner le temps d'allumer la lumière, je m'étais déjà chié dessus !!!|`|JFn337Kcaa	Mdrrrr !!!!|`|C2TQ4fSxaa	Bonne!!!|`|5OwqSxRJaa	pas compris ...|`|5f1c0561380ba2e85021284c991ffc58aa	?!|`|h9qzHzPMaa	Si elle sait lire l′anglais.......... et monter en voiture..... hihihi (*)|`|xRaGyugTaa	je n ai même pas compris

Popb5OKtaa	Try restoring it.|`|20e07a3496debbebebb5ce629eb663fcaa	i agree with the fourth one because i have had ipod troubles before and so you may have to restore it by pressing the center botton and the menu botton. if this doesn't work then it's broken|`|8VZDy4Htaa	press the center button and menu at the same time until the apple icon appears in the screen, and that resets it. You could always bring it to someplace like best buy and they might be able to help you! the people there are very knowledgable. OR my best bet is to go to apple.com and go to the iPod support thingy and talk to an apple rep. if they can't help...well it think you need to get a new iPod. my last thing is was your iPod on in the blazing sun? that could have washed it out or faded it, idk if that's even possible but it makes a lil bit of sense!|`|M55uZtNvaa	go to the website it will tell you how to reboot it. I went through three of them in less then a year. The one I have now is pretty good. But definitely check the website, there's a lot of info on it.

m0TqKoAraa	hola Sofía..pues la verdad aficionada al comic, no soy..pero me gusta mas Marvel, por la trama que maneja...es que DC..a veces es repetitivo..y mezclan demasiadas cosas..y termino confundida...xD<br>  <br>  Saluditos..n_n|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	De Marvel me gusta que tiene un alto nivel de realismo, hay muerte y vulnerabilidades mas reales, los personajes tienen problemas cotidianos mas humanizantes, de DC me gusta la tradicion de sus heroes y su sentido del heroismo, es mas sacrificado e idealista hasta rasar muchas veces tintes epicos.<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|Y7UjMzpdaa	me gustan los dos, aunque por ahora compro mas titulos DC que MArvel.<br>  <br>  Green Lantern está pasando por una muyu buena saga con Sinestro Corps War.<br>  <br>  Amazons Attack está muy bien escrita y los dibujos cumplen su cometido, aunque se enlaza con muchos titulos.<br>  <br>  Countdown no ha acabado de gustarme, pero al menos me da un panorama de los titulos que no leo.<br>  <br>  All Star SUPERMAN es la crema de la crema en cuanto a titulos del azuloso. Escribe Grant Morrison y Dibuja Frank Quietly.<br>  <br>  De Marvel, ultimamente compre los TP de Ultimates vol 2, super recomendables, y no me trepé al carro de Civil War en su momento, pero ya que terminó, le estoy siguiendo la pista en espa?ol. Está buena, pero el status quo actual que nos dejó no me acaba de convencer.|`|H5hulBHNaa	Jaja! me gustan los dos, pero la que más me gusta es Marvel, bueno, la razón es por los personajes, como Gambito, Wolfverine etc... tienen diferentes poderes y no falta la trama.<br>  <br>  Saludos! n_n|`|IzaXiRwGaa	A mi me gusta mas Marvel, DC es muy infantil.|`|fb7da14f3d33d8ef508190ca76cec1caaa	la vision de DC es muy simplista y hasta a veces un poco ?o?a por lo menos en los titulos de superman aunque tienen buenas tramas en otros, pero son muy alineados en cuanto a tocar temas controvertidos o politicos, y la vision de marvel es muy buena encuanto a que todos los heres constantemente estan interactuando entre ellos, pero esto te hace comprar otros titulos con tal de seguirle los pasos a tu heroe preferido,<br>  los titulos DC son buenos para quienes apenas empiezan a leer comics, o no pueden comprar muchos, <br>  los de Marvel son para lectores un poco mas avanzados o que gustan de comprar muchos para seguir tramas aunque a veces se enredan mucho.|`|2349ba91b815c3c12cf736c03dec01c5aa	a mi me gusta mas el universo marvel es dentro de lo que cabe mas real y tambien los super heroes son mas humanos y las historias son mucho mas interesantes.|`|33s11iE4aa	bueno soy fanatico del manga pero prefiro 1000 veces el dc que el marvel bueno xao|`|3470abe735db01b35301c154d9fefdaeaa	100% MARVEL pienso que las historia relacionadas con sus personajes presentan conflictos mas reales y personales prueba de ello mi preferido SPIDERMAN!!!|`|767058d1c1673729036d27e4fb09f73faa	puagh, DC, Marvel esta mejor, tiene al mejor superhéroe.....SI... SPIDERMAN!!!!!<br>  <br>  También los de Marvel se relacionan entre ellos y tienen buenas tramas como Marvel Zombies, Marvel Civil War o viejitas como Secret Wars y Marvel Team-Up, los superhérores son más humanos, comenten errores a cada rato como Peter Parker o buscan una causa de igualdad como los XMen|`|UTzERFbyaa	Las dos son buenas.....si escojo una en particular me vuelvo monotono..y asi la cosa aburre...<br>  las dos :)|`|abX8qfbpaa	Marvel sin duda|`|clafm4PTaa	1000 veces Marvel<br>  DC es muy infantil todos sus superheroes se dedican a estar corriendo en la calle en calsoncillos, que no tienen vida sentimientos ni problemas????<br>  Dc es demaciado repetitivo y solo se dedica a hacer historias comerciales que puedan ser bien vendidas  <br>  Marvel es mejor pues sus superheroes son "gente de verdad"   tienen sus propios problemas|`|pVhaAJYtaa	A mi me gusta mas Universo Marvel, ya que sus personajes son mas interesantes y originales, como spider-man (si no existiera nunca se me habria ocurrido ese personaje) y en general los villanos son demasiodo originales, ademas de que tiene, en mi opinion, una historia mas interesante.<br>  <br>  Es raro que un personaje de Marvel no me guste en cambio es raro que un personeje de Dc me guste. Solo Batman, linterna verde y Flash me gustan.|`|bpUVEyIMaa	A mi me gusta mas Marvel porque siento que los personajes tienen vidas mas afines a las de una persona normal, bueno en realidad esa fuel la gran inovcion contra DC, adolecentes con problemas comunes de la edad, o adultos con problemas y sentido de justicia, gente real que usaba sus poderes de forma real y no eran invencibles, en DC muchos son con superpoderes natos, y en el caso de Superman son casi invencibles y ganan la mayoria de las veces, en lo personal no me atrae el concepto pero me encanta Batman, siempre ha sido de mis favoritos junto con Spiderman, crecì con ellos

(yo era un ni?o)   En esa época, los vehículos no contaban con cinturones de seguridad y  era muy usual irse de fiesta a miradores y tomar licor, también era normal las carreras de autos y manejar a grandes velocidades, en Costa Rica le llamamos PIKES, fue una época de hippies (hagamos el amor no la guerra) época de liberación sexual y filial<br>  Saludos.

qTFIf9nuaa	I'd take the synthetic if you have room, and buy a warm insert/liner for it from your camping store. I think you can get some that have a thermal quality to them, so that way if the bag gets wet, you won't know and the insert/liner will give you the extra warmth .

f76c21a8fa2b01f49a333049deb1e2fcaa	julien était depuis le début le gagnant évident. je suis seulement étonné qu'il plaise au grand public car il n'est pas dans le moule habituel. même marianne james n'a rien compris lorsqu'il a fait I put a spell on you de screaming jay hawkins, sa version était quasiment identique à celle de son auteur, ou tout au moins dans le même esprit. il a un super talent, sait chanter dans divers registres et toujours juste. <br>  vu sa personnalité, je plains seulement ses futurs directeurs artistiques et autres managers qui n'arriveront certainement pas à le formater. j'espère qu'il restera lui même.|`|057c86b0b461fefd13da075e9c120cf0aa	J'ai (par pure curiosité musicale) vu quelques extraits de Julien. Franchement, et de la part du musicien que je suis qui certes n'a pas de talent mais des oreilles, Julien ne sait pas chanter. Je sais c'est dur. C'est pas qu'il chante faux, mais il ne sait pas chanter avec l'orchestration, comme si sa partition était indépendante du reste, il ne sait pas véhiculer d'émotions. Pour moi, c'est éventuellement un bon acteur parce qu'il en fait des tonnes, mais franchement pas un chanteur.|`|0f7d589ed7a6309862ef06790a296435aa	Comme Prof Nico, je n'apprécie pas du tout Julien. Pour moi il ne sait faire que du bruit. Franchement, avec lui, chaque chanson est identique. Il n'y a pas de différence entre ce qu'il a fait sur Moi Lolita que sur les autres... OK, il réinvente les chansons qu'on lui propose, mais c'est tout.<br>  <br>  Je dois avouer que Tigane ne me pla?t pas non plus. D'ailleurs, je ne suivais quasi plus l'émission depuis l'éviction de Martine et Michel, qui - à mon avis - avaient une chance de gagner. Mais bon, quand on sait que ceux qui votent sont des gamines de 15 ans qui craquent pour un beau gosse, faut pas s'étonner que ce soit Julien et Tigane qui aient été en finale...|`|EWQ7ZiYXaa	Moi aussi je suis très heureuse que ce soit Julien|`|Sg5Sa3Aeaa	hyper satisfaite et très contente et pour une fois la nouvelle star le mérite vraiment. julien c'est quelqu'un qui doit faire un album, son propre album, et je suis excitée de voir ce qu'il va nous sortir comme chansons !|`|b4ff30afc6020e386c3028d0fb48edecaa	Trés satisaite, je le voyais déjà vainqueur à la première audition.<br>  Belle voix chaude et pleine de nuances, un zeste d'originalité, deux doigts de rock pur et dur ....<br>  j'ai adoré toutes ses prestations.<br>  Tigane n'avait pas le carisme de Julien, qui d'assurance en auto dérision, saura gérer sa carrière sans se perdre ou trop se prendre au sérieux.<br>  Tigane chantait bien aussi, mais beaucoup moins original avec une personnalité trop accée "bien gentil".<br>  il se serait fait bouffer, car la variété de nos jours, seuls les requins détachés ou décalés comme Julien s'en tirent.|`|cd2bc93a0cc48ff7d947ba965884492daa	Une vraie personalité qui s'est ressentie et non formatée comme à la star ac!|`|xRaGyugTaa	non je ne suis pas satisfaite car tigane aurait du gagner il était mieux que julien|`|Kd9dCYQ8aa	Je trouve que Julien était le plus professionnel. Il a vraiment apporté une touche personnelle à ces interprétations, un véritable talent de composition. On sent que c'est un musicos...<br>  <br>  Il a un vrai talent d'artiste.<br>  <br>  C'est la première fois que je suis cette émission et c'est un peu à causse (grace) à lui.|`|OAfVTvW9aa	J'aime bien les deux mais je pense que Tigane méritait aussi de gagner.|`|P21KzKnTaa	Moi aussi j'ai flashé direct !<br>  Avec son yukulélé, il m'a fait bien rire !|`|anOOUbeJaa	belle émission mais bon tigane n'a pas gagné c'est dommage|`|e9f1a7224a0ce620b7587b25b7e0f6f8aa	non pas du tout, c'est une émission qui ne sert à rien et qui prend la tête.<br>  combien des gagnants entend-on sur les ondes ???<br>  En plus Julien été nul, c'est tigane qui devait gagner !!!|`|gtL2sahWaa	on demande si satisfaction de la nouvelle star et pas de polémiquer sur qui a gagné ou perdu on a de toute fa?on tous un avis divergeant, mais le casting de cette année était à la hauteur de l'émission des gens de tous univers artistiques et c'est ce qui compte, après qui gagne qui perd c'est pas un scoop mais on a vu des perdants avec un avenir plus ensoleillé que certains gagnants.<br>  Espère une prochaine nouvelle star on découvre de nouveaux talents et c'est ?a le but|`|nP9LW4RTaa	Je trouve que la Nouvelle Star est une émission intéressante lors des auditions. Après à Baltard, je m'ennuie et je zappe.|`|3RzJSS89aa	Franchement d'habitude je ne suis pas fan de ce genre d'émission mais là c'est vraique julien à quelque chose de particulier<br>  Je suis d'accord avec vous les musiciens c'est vrai que musicalement Julien n'est pas top, mais je trouve trouve qu'il fait bien le spectacle et pour une émission comme nouvelle star ou même le jury consent à dire que la justesse et musicalité on s'en fou ce qu'on veut c'est le spectable voil? pourquoi je trouve qu'il est particulier.|`|39db653d61356867cec83ec2898e7c76aa	Non.|`|bf1e2deb720a9a37f2dc54618d38934faa	oui, c'était couru d'avance qu'il gagne, car il sortait vraiment du lot. il est vraiment sur une planète à part. Julie était un peu comme lui d'ailleurs.<br>  Julien a eu énormément de la chance, car au casting le jury aurait pu refuser définitivement qu'il chante avec son yukulélé|`|eb6922dc8fe9e5b6e3be1c252ecf35a6aa	Vous regardez encore la nouvelle star ?|`|ncxxgnGFaa	Très satisfaite car je voulais que Julien gagne.

fTaA6RwYaa	Le groupe s'appelle Mecano et la chanson s'appelle Hijo de la Luna, dans la version fran?aise.<br>  Il y a 2 versions de cette chanson (une en espagnol, une en fran?ais). <br>  Mecano a écrit la chanson d'origine, mais elle a été reprise depuis (d'où les réponses ci-dessus qui font référence à un autre artiste).<br>  <br>  Voici les paroles de la chanson d'origine :<br>  <br>  Idiot qui ne comprend pas<br>  La légend' qui comme ?a<br>  Dis qu'une gitane<br>  Implora la lune<br>  Jusqu'au lever du jour<br>  Pleurant elle demandait<br>  Un gitan qui voudrait<br>  L'épouser par amour<br>  <br>  Tu auras ton homme, femme brune,<br>  Du ciel répondit la pleine lune,<br>  Mais il faut me donner<br>  Ton enfant le premier<br>  Dès qu'il te sera né<br>  Celle qui pour un homme<br>  Son enfant immole,<br>  Bien peu l'aurait aimé.<br>  <br>  [Refrain:]<br>  Lune tu veux être mère<br>  Tu ne trouve pas l'amour<br>  Qui exauce ta prière<br>  Dis moi lune d'argent<br>  Toi qui n'as pas de bras<br>  Comment bercer l'enfant<br>  Hijo de la luna.<br>  <br>  D'un gitan cannelle<br>  Naquit l'enfant<br>  Tout comme l'hermine,<br>  Il était blanc,<br>  Ses prunelles grises<br>  Pas couleur olive<br>  Fils albinos de lune<br>  Maudit sois tu, batard!<br>  T'es la fils d'un gadjo<br>  T'es le fils d'un blafard.<br>  <br>  [Refrain]<br>  <br>  Le gitan se croyant déshonoré<br>  Couteau en main sa femme alla trouver,<br>  L'enfant n'est pas de moi,<br>  Tu m'as trompé, je vois!<br>  A mort il l'a blessa<br>  Et l'enfant dans ses bras<br>  La colline il monta,<br>  Là haut l'abandonna...<br>  <br>  [Refrain]<br>  <br>  Et les soirs où l'enfant joue et sourit,<br>  de joie aussi la lune s'arrondit<br>  Et lorsque l'enfant pleure<br>  Elle décro?t pour lui faire<br>  Un berceau de lumière|`|e5539c73cac51dd5f01aa87754488c19aa	psy 4 de la rime, enfants de la lune|`|PYLJsIspaa	moi des bras des bras dieu donne moi des bras ,c'est joli

seule à qui j'me confie et qui peut me voir,<br>  Mon ange gardienne, à qui je fais la bise,<br>  qui veille, sur mes conneries qui me font flancher comme la tour de Pise.<br>  L'envie de te serrer fort car à la maison c'est le bordel,<br>  c'est le cortège des enfants seuls, enfantés comme Corneille.<br>  A peine 13 piges, crapotte ma premiere cig'<br>  peur de grandir auprès de toi, la mère qui n'a pas de bras.<br>  Quiere el amor, el amor de los hermanos,<br>  que vive la noche, los locos de eso mondo, adios.<br>  Car j'suis jeune et je jetterai pas mon cartable<br>  quand je vois que les trois huit pour certains frères ne sont pas rentables.<br>  La vie intacte, et j'ai peur de me faire couper,<br>  Malgré ton clair de lune, les Pierrots ne sont pas satisfaits<br>  Por favor qui

leurs verités.<br>  Enfant de la Lune, orphelin quand le soleil se lève,<br>  Quand le silence fait trop de bruit nous on s'entend trop gamberger<br>  Y a plus d'ainés, ils sont morts à la guerre de la drogue<br>  ou en for?ant le barrage de la liberté<br>  J'ai pas à t'expliquer leur geste<br>  ni à laver leur linge sale devant la presse,<br>  leurs familles ne l'ont pas fait.<br>  Lune, dehors il fait un temps de crève,<br>  la routine ne fait pas de grève,<br>  comprend que j'ai le ton grave<br>  comme la situation de ces nuits,<br>  toi qui n'as pas de bras, comment retenir la folie de mes 22 piges?<br>  tu sais, entre une transac', le bruit d'un transalp', un joint et des cartes, une discution de chatte,<br>  je suis là, la rétine tremblante.<br>  Atteindre la quarantaine serait un privilège dans cette ambiance<br>  <br>  {au Refrain}<br>  <br>  [Soprano]:<br>  Ce soir j'ai pas la pêche, j'ouvre une bouteille pour accuser le coup,<br>  en plus il pleut des cordes un temps à se les foutre au cou.<br>  J'suis là, trempé de la casquette aux orteils,<br>  à prendre conscience que mon adolescence a pris de la bouteille.<br>  J'fais le bilan, 35 ans, pas un franc<br>  des freres enterrés ou au bagne, et des fesses assises sur le même banc.<br>  J'tremble,<br>  car la mort ?a tue sans mobile, et qu'faut de la caille pour nourrir ce petit qui me ressemble.<br>  J'n'arrive pas a assumer ce que Dieu me donne.<br>  J'passe mes nuits dans le lit d'un verre de rhum.<br>  J'ai mon tr?ne au milieu des laches,<br>  ma couronne sertie par les larmes que ma famille me lache,<br>  car j'suis une loque,<br>  j'vis au crochet d'ma femme et d'ses allocs,<br>  j'cours derrière cette jeunesse passée dans un block,<br>  à attendre que tu vienne me chercher,<br>  mais ce soir, ententds, elles viennent me chercher...<br>  <br>  [Ana Torroja]:<br>  Luna quieres ser madre<br>  Y no encuentras querer que ta haga mujer<br>  Dime luna de plata<br>  Que pretendes hacer con un ni?o de

I tripped on the fence and fell face first onto the grass.  Well, I should say "into the mud" because it had been raining and like I said, this grass was struggling.  So there I was in the middle of the busiest city in the world, besplattered and looking for a place to clean up, which wasn't easy because I looked like I hadn't bathed in about a month.

0e52865c1a7d74cad4589fdc3f6c0d41aa	Alternative rock (also called alternative music or simply alternative; known primarily in the UK as indie) is a genre of rock music that emerged in the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. The term "alternative" was coined in the 1980s to describe punk rock-inspired bands on independent record labels that did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time.[1] As a musical genre, alternative rock consists of various subgenres that have emerged from the indie music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, Britpop, gothic rock, and indie pop. These genres are unified by their collective debt to the style and/or ethos of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s.[2]<br>  <br>  Though the genre is considered to be rock, some of its subgenres are influenced by folk music, reggae, electronic music and jazz among other genres. At times alternative rock has been used as a catch-all phrase for rock music from underground artists in the 1980s, all music descended from punk rock (including punk itself, New Wave, and post-punk), and, ironically, for rock music in general in the 1990s and 2000s.|`|9DBCf6sDaa	It is ususally of a spiritual nature like Christian, Gospel music.|`|JObMHvKGaa	it's better!|`|AA11910068	There is no such thing as regular music. Music is so diverse that it hard to say that it is just regular. That's why we have different genres and catagories. In my opinion, alternative muic is mostly made by white people. Now don't get it twisted. I am not racist. In fact, I love Kelly Clarkson, Green Day, Ashely Simpson, etc. But just like alternative, there's urban music which is made by blacks. So, I think overall all music in some ways are alike but for the most part it is different as well. I hope that answers your question!|`|tDwRjCfNaa	okay its kind of hard for us to tell you that, what you need to do i listen to some alternative music, and then compare it to "regular music"

I sorta understood some parts but i still don't understand the part where they're watching that lady on the screen and denzel if i remember correctly hits the screen or throws something at it and she actually saw it. I don't understand how that works and how the hell they sent him back in time either. it's so confusing.....|`|m3pNwlzhaa	Well...first thing is that this is really really fiction, written by someone with a really cool imagination.  First of all they picked the detective to look at their "footage" because they knew he was smart and they had a gut feeling he would want to do the right thing for any number of reasons.  It just so happens he did the right thing for all the reasons.  As for how did they get things to work in the "past".  Once he went through the time portal he was in the present with memories which came in-tact.  The writer took the whole idea of .... if you knew then what you know now what would you do different?  Are you starting to get the idea?  The movie was all about making the impossible happen and fixing a wrong thing, with only the bad guys (mostly only the bad guy) getting killed rather than all those hundereds and especially the lovely lady he fell for... cool story.... watch it several times it will make better sence.|`|qNvPOWymaa	The machine they use to see into the past does so by opening a tiny portal or hole which, if given enough power, can open it large enough to send things or people through. <br>  <br>  The people in the past cannot see the hole, but since it is well, a hole, the people in the future can manipulate things to some extent.

AA12276309	I have a Sagittarius girl and I am an Aries man. I think she is awesome and very attractive. Makes me laugh. Maybe I'll end up marrying her?!!|`|gMxdTR9Laa	i just have 2 tell u that saggitarians are the best horoscope out there! i mean us sags get along with everyone no matter what horoscope sign u are. a sag is always gonna find a way to make u laugh or make u like them.it is true wat the others say about guys falling in love with us instantly and having great bodies.  we are simply irrestible people , its hard not to like us sags. =D|`|acLeD14Vaa	She is a free-spirited, easygoing person who has a zest for living... reminds me of my sister. :*( She is in New Zealand right now. Miss her so.|`|56aPsgD0aa	They are intimidated by our strength, but are not able to see how sensitive, kind and generous we are. <br>  <br>  Takes a *real man* to love a Sag girl. He has to be very secure with himself.<br>  <br>  Edit: Melandi is a fire sign too, they can appreciate us.|`|6486d805c7376b91ac13c160d1845727aa	Guys are often strongly attracted to Sagittarius women.  Our strength, free-spirit, sense of fun, independence, care-free attitude, kindness, friendliness, generosity and compassion really appeals to them, not to mention we are usually in great shape, with a lot of energy to burn in so many ways!!! We can be both a very feminine lady and a tomboy that just enjoys hanging out with the guys.  When we believe in a cause or goal and something or someone means much to us, we're quite passionate and give it our all.  Our friends count on us for a shoulder to cry on and ear to listen.  When they need a boost, cheer or laughter, we don't disappoint!  Indeed.....I agree........It takes a real secure man to be with us and to handle us.  If he's not, he will learn quickly once he realizes what he has............  :-)|`|8c812c5e1155816ce1cc84eb4aa152e2aa	a nice person. my bff is a sagittarious =)|`|aa6e5856c840ca3ba7f330356b9c70f5aa	I'd have to agree with all of the above, except rick. <br>  <br>  Of course, I am a sag too. <br>  <br>  No guys don't like me!|`|AA11627170	Doesn't matter at all. Your personality has absolutely nothing to do with when you were born. That's all nonsense.|`|MFa5EMEbaa	it depends on her other signs, but i think sagittarius women r sum of the best looking women in the world.  alot of actresses & celebrities i find attractive r sagittarius risings or suns(mostly suns though).  im a gemini, so maybe opposites do attract.  besides being physically attractive, i like that sagittarius's r passionate abt things they feel strongly abt, but they also can have a care-free attitude 4 the most part.  they arent up-tight, & evry sag frnd i have, i feel i can talk 2 w/ no problems.<br>  <br>  hey rick...if u dont believe in astrology, y r u here?|`|ivJDFvx6aa	IMA SAGITTARIUS GIRL TOO!!!!!!!!!!

Si tu veux comparer Prison Break à quelque chose, c'est à Oz par exemple (et là, sans conteste c'est Oz qui gagne, haut la main)<br>  <br>  Supernatural développe sa propre mythologie (totalement différente du Buffyverse), ?a se tient assez bien.

XJyyxT31aa	I'm not sure, since I don't read Ranma 1/2. The reason might be just the same reason why there are shorter/less anime episodes sometimes. It may be due to profanity or they shortened some chapters so there would be 2 volumes less?<br>  <br>  <br>  This is what Wikipedia says though: <br>  <br>  Each graphic novel covers roughly the same amount of material as a tankouban, but Viz incorporated minor differences in grouping so that the English language version spans 36 volumes rather than the Japanese number of 38.|`|BlvaSBubaa	They were condensed.... it happens a lot with the transliteration from the more emotionally involved Japanese to the almost barren English..... the emotions displayed in the Japanese versions are more in depth and in tune with the Japanese cultural themes, as the English version conversely did the same, unfortunately in 2 fewer volumes.

iDIhVd0kaa	COMO LLEGO A TARADOWARS?|`|fa3936d620b38deabb9c3f93394668a7aa	danny y sam juntos??<br>  <br>  pues practicamente en todos (52 en total)....<br>  <br>  Si te refieres a que si salen juntos como... novios, pues todo  se consuma en el ultimo episodio; llamado planeta phantom donde terminan como novios por siempre; a manera de pacto...<br>  <br>  Segun la sinopsis, en la ultima escena Sam le devuelve a Danny el anillo que él le iba a dar a Valerie y le confiesa sus sentimientos; descubriendo que Danny siente lo mismo por ella. Después Danny va a la Zona Fantasma y recibe el apoyo de todos los fantasmas del mundo. Danny revela su identidad humana a todos. Tiempo después, Tucker da homenaje a Danny Phantom haciendole una estatua, a pesar de que él falta a la ceremonia debido a que está en un día de campo con Sam. En eso, Sam se convierte en la novia de Danny y ambos empiezan una relación.<br>  <br>  No se si ese es el episodio que busques; te sere sincero, no lo he visto completo, aqui en México no lo han pasado en se?al abierta....<br>  <br>  Pero hay una pagina donde puedes descargar episodios directamente....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://vagos.es/showthread.php?t=225526" rel="nofollow">http://vagos.es/showthread.php?t=225526</a><br>  <br>  No hay duda, Danny y Sam son una gran pareja.....|`|EPLzrNXnaa	En los capitulos que mas salen juntos o pasa algo entre ellos dos son en:<br>  -"Una Traición Al Corazon"<br>  que en este capitulo el dany demuestra que le dan selos porque sam esta enamorada de gregor  un estudiante de intercambio gotico de europa.<br>  <br>  otro capitulo puede ser:-Pesadilla Fantasma <br>  donde dani sue?a con que sam es su novia y sam parece que estaba so?ando algo parecido.<br>  <br>  en una pagina dice que se llama asi: ventilando las llamas<br>  <br>  Pero no estoy segura si es su nombre real o titulo, supuestamente es el episodio 11.<br>  Bueno en fin se trata de que Danny y Sam encuentran su amistad platónica convertida en forzadamente romántica a través de los poderes musicales de Ember, una fantasma rockera que se alimenta de la adoración de adolescentes. Con su masivo concierto preparado para dentro de unos días que será retransmitido en el mundo entero y le dará un poder invencible, ahora Sam tiene que conseguir que un enamorado Danny se centre en cazar fantasmas.<br>  Aunque eso signifique romperle el corazón.<br>  <br>  Y por ultimo el episodio 52 o 53:<br>  <br>  Planeta Phantom <br>  Vlad roba el Infimapa y Danny Phantom lo recupera destruyendo el Satélite de Vlad que hace que un enorme asteroide vaya directo hacia la Tierra, esto desata la furia de Vlad que decide acabar a Danny Phantom de una vez por todas, comenzando por poner a unos cazadores de fantasmas para que reemplacen a Danny , esto hace que Danny Fenton renuncie a sus poderes entrando en el portal y destruyendolo por completo quedandose como un humano mas. En un intento por ser el amo supremo,Vlad revela su identidad frente a todos y ofrece hacer intangible al asteroide a cambio de dominar todo el mundo y que le pagen 500 billones de dólares; pero su plan falla al descubrir que el meteoro está compuesto por un elemento inmune a los poderes hectoplásmicos y al ser abandonado en el espacio se da cuenta de que ha perdido todo.<br>  <br>  Con una última esperanza, Danny, Sam, Jazz y Tucker viajan a la Zona Fantasma; pero son atacados por Skulker, quien al atacar a Danny junto con otros fantasmas le devuelve accidentalmente sus poderes. A Danny se le ocurre un plan: hacer a la Tierra intangible,y Tucker lo revela a todas las personas. Sam le devuelve a Danny el anillo que él le iba a dar a Valerie y le confiesa sus sentimientos; descubriendo que Danny siente lo mismo por ella. Después Danny va a la Zona Fantasma y recibe el apoyo de todos los fantasmas del mundo. Luego de que la Tierra es salvada del meteorito, Danny revela su identidad humana a todos. Tiempo después, Tucker da homenaje a Danny Phantom haciendole una estatua, a pesar de que él falta a la ceremonia debido a que está en un día de campo con Sam. En eso, Sam se convierte en la novia de Danny y ambos empiezan una relación.<br>  espero k te sirva de algo<br>  sayonara<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  En caso de que quieras saber mas de los capitulos<br>  hay dos paginas:<br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_Episodios_de_Danny_Phantom" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_Ep...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://usuarios.lycos.es/padrinosmagicos/danguide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usuarios.lycos.es/padrinosmagicos...</a>|`|3eCHgbT4aa	En el ultimo capitulo ellos terminan juntos y todo el mundo sabe k danny es un fantasma jeje... no se si eso es lo que preguntas pero... ojala y te sirva :p|`|6skHxMDBaa	ps en donde mas he visto que salen juntos es en el del collar que los convierte en dragon, es donde mas se nota que quieren andar.
J9gr1oKGaa	no sasuke aun no tiene el mangekio sharingan,,,si kakashi pudo alcanzarlo,,pero si recuerdas para que sasuke obtenga el mangekyo sharingan debe matar a su mejor amigo (a naruto)...lo que si obtiene tecnicas muy buenas pero ahi te dejo..<br>  <br>  ah se me olvidaba naruto ya va en el manga 364 como te dije aun no obtiene el mangekio sharingan,,aunque el entrenamiento de orochimaru dio frutos ,,,dandole a sasuke nuevas tecnicas y poderes ,,aun asi el mismo sasuke admite no estar al nivel  de itachi,,,no te cuento mas es mejor que tu lo leas..|`|LmVfN9vuaa	cLaro q lo tiene !!!<br>  <br>  es super inTeligente ademas en la autoexplosion de<br>  deidara-san,, sasuKe-sama se pudo salvar gracias al mangekyou ya que abrio un portal y se teletransporto ^^!<br>  al menos que se haya metido a la boka de Mandara-saMa ya q fue la q recibio las mas fuertes heridas en la explosion pero no lo creo ^^!|`|MCRhdgLDaa	sasuke no llega a consegir el  mangekyo sharingan ya que para ello debe matar asu mejor amigo naruto y sabemos que nose atreberia|`|NsNc3GNHaa	.|`|UTzERFbyaa	Si...pero no en el primer episodio de shippuden ...ya que tenia que matar a naruto para conseguirlo y el deside conseguirlo por su propia forma y no copiando a itashi....en el anime... basado en el manga...mas adelante veras que lo obtiene XD|`|csXvZalHaa	Creo que si. En un capitulo del anime, donde Sasuuke casi mata a Naruto, dice que no va a convertirse en lo que su hermano quiere, y que buscara otra forma de vencerlo, que lo hara a su manera. Tal vez los consiga sin tener que matar a Naruto.|`|oX1pR7Deaa	te podria dar la respuesta pero hay muchos que prefieren seguir el anime en lugar de el manga y les hecharia a perder la historia.|`|wqVZqKiFaa	claro sasuke lo tiene lo q pasa esq no lo savi usar por eso fue q duro tamto tiempo en sacarlo|`|srIxMVUtaa	Pues, hasta el momento no, y no lo creo, para eso tendría que matar a Naruto, y no lo hizó cuando tuvo la oportunidad, así que creo que no.|`|VUCsIrjEaa	hola de creer si lo creo pues si kakashi lo obtuvo entrenando imagino que sasuke tambien... Pero por alguna razon sasuke quiso matar a naruto en shippuuden (decia que el ya habia cortado esos lazos, pero q ganaba con  matarlo nose???)  Aunque ni el manga sasuke no ha mostrado su mangekyo sharingan... ni ha dicho que lo obtuvo, solo se ha dicho que ya tiene poder..|`|C8WmR2ulaa	ES LO MAS SEGURO|`|Rm6szazuaa	no se ya tiene un buen que no lo veo :P|`|d0ZnM45Maa	si, porque sino en el shippuuden no podria haber visto el zorro en el interior de naruto, o que le a proporcionado poder orochimaru|`|hHhHUGPSaa	Quien sabe,,, pero yo creo que no, por que para hacerlo tienes que matar a tu mejor amigo y como el lo dijo es naruto,,pero si lo mata entonces se acaba la historia ,  ,,, pero existe la posibilidad de que la obtenga de otra forma por que en una pagina del manga el lider de akakiutsu le dise a su compa?era  que el va a tener los ojos mas poderosos que su hermano.....pero quien sabe

j4CPkXqzaa	1. During one of the featurettes on the DVD, I believe the screenwriter says that Phil was there for hundreds if not thousands of years!<br>  2. Andie McDowell is very pretty, despite having some less-than-perfect teeth.<br>  3. I don't think it would have been appropriate for Phil to have reacted much more excitedly than he did because by the end of the movie, he had come to enjoy his existence living the small-town life. He was NOT living a personal hell by that time.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, I was just thinking of Bill Murray and his being in Groundhog Day, in particular, just this morning when my brothers and sisters were watching Space Jam, which features an expanded cameo of Bill Murray. ;)|`|KWGF4ZyFaa	When Bill and Andie are flipping cards into a hat on his bed, I believe he said around 6 months or so.  <br>  <br>  I never really noticed her teeth.

ebabba6f3b09db1881ddbf3eb7f0a01daa	The answer is Spider-man.  Superman gets his props, since without him, we wouldn't have any superheroes.  He was the original.<br>  However, it terms of characters, Superman has all the powers...he can fly, heat vision, super breath, super speed, x-ray vision, invincibility.  Frankly, he can do anything and can't really be beaten.  Where's the fun in that?  Where's the drama?  They have to make up intergalactic bad guys to keep things interesting.<br>  <br>  Spider-man, on the other hand, is not invincible.  He can be hurt.  A bullet will kill him if a bad guy gets off a lucky shot.  But he does have really cool powers.  He has the webs, he can climb walls, and he's got spidey-sense.  That keeps things fun and more dramatic, since you start thinking those powers just might not be enough for Spidey to save the day.  <br>  Most importantly, he's just a nerdy kid with real everyday problems living in the Big Apple.  You can really relate to him...a lot more than you can relate to a super-powered alien who was raised on a Kansas farm (although living in NJ, I do have a slight bias in that area).|`|f0f49830d899d32e723fa4545fb903ebaa	Superman may be stronger but we all know that spidey is the cool one because he is much more human and easy to relate to.|`|543039c61990e753cb9a980f2203ad38aa	Spiderman is way better than Superman.<br>  Superman is just a goody two shoes.<br>  Spiderman is the cool rebel superhero.|`|CbGTfirjaa	superman is sexyer!|`|OFTaEnMoaa	Spiderman.  He's sexier.|`|S7lwl6pzaa	spiderman is bcuz he is a newer edition of a superhero...also because he has better superpowers and he goes through things that are great and are much newer then superman......also because he is much newer and superman is getting old..........also the movies have helped get his popularity ratings up and superman hasn't done a movie and is getting boring...........also spiderman appeals to both adults and kids, and superman appeals more to little kids. good luck hope you side wins

rY23uewCaa	it's good you can play as vergil from the start and it has a lot of added costumes. for 19.99 it's worth it. <br>  Resident evil and DMC are two different types of games but they both are good but i think i like Resident Evile 4 just a little bit better.|`|M9qxToXPaa	its alright, I have watched it be played by my brother, the effects are pretty nice as well as the new moves and weapons are brutal but cool :D But if you liked the other devil may cry's then this one you will also like I think :]<br>  <br>  Resident evil I have never been a fan of :/

FMkkwFYQaa	If you love someone you care deeply enough to risk your life for them. If you like someone then you care enough to give them helpful advice, inspiration, and you are there for them if they need comfort, a good laugh or anything.|`|AA11610394	there are many kinds of love but love is deeper than liking|`|AA11721384	Love is when u wanna marry sum1 and have kids wit them and everything, even take a bullet from them and like is like when u think sum1 is cute and u just think they foine and everything . But Love is stronger then Like|`|HAerahxzaa	when u feel that you're deeply and madly in love with someone even though maybe you haven't still learned enough about how the person really is.. that is liking!!

I am not entirely certain that they build full custom anymore... perhaps they just load stock models with different parts.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you search out a guitar builder in your area.

Very intriguing. I think they look as though they are supposed to match the necklet, so the square silver stud is the base for the design, which must be soldered on to them. I thought at first they might be ear cuffs which can be pressed on to the earlobe because of the soft metal they are made of,  but the square base earstud seems to be for pierced ears. I think they look like the eye-shaped link of the necklet.|`|3YqSvJPmaa	I dont care that much, sry|`|tNYpDymraa	actually they are diamonds...im a major criss angel freak..he is the best magician EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

T1tInPW4aa	hola nessa:<br>  <br>  esa pregunta vendria bien una vez q ya hayan sacado todas<br>  <br>  suerte|`|5c9e107eaf9aaf00e23232b982b76d3daa	Están todas muy bien, pero la que más me gusta es la tercera.|`|9894716d979b58d2d8ea60f7b1926aedaa	Hasta ahorita, la que más me gusta es la tercera, "Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban", creo que ha sido la mejor película... y también es mi libro favorito de lo que va de la historia!|`|5XGox1Qbaa	Hola pues mira nose...<br>  yo me lei los libros de la 1 las 2 y la 3 antes de ver la pelicula entonce spues ya sabia que iba a pasar y esas cosas..pero igual me parecia chevere. Aunque siempre dejan cosas que a uno le gustaria que mostraran y pues nunca lo hacen porque si no qeudaria larrguisima.<br>  <br>  Pero la cutro que no me habia leido el libro aun... me parecio genia... no se si era por que la historia se prestaba mucho para la recreacion o que definitivamente es la mejor.<br>  <br>  En conclusion la 4 es la que mas me ha gustado.|`|DBSF4oraaa	La primera y la segunda|`|IToF0xcBaa	Todas han sido geniales pero me encantan El Prisionero de Azkaban por lo de regresar el tiempo y como se descubre la verdad sobre Sirius y Colagusano, aparte de la aparición de los dementores.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte El Cáliz de Fuego por la muerte de Cedric además de las pruebas del torneo y el encuentro entre Harry y Voldemort|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	la 5 esta xida<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yala vi<br>  jejejejejejejejejeje(la neta)|`|4182ab72b18fc08b343b89deeb8cd19caa	La que el se muere y desaparece para no volver jamas,nunca jamas jajajajajja|`|63ddb0015c981d2877c08966e3c62dc7aa	creo que va hacer esta la ultima definitivamente el ya a madurado bastante y parece que dejo de ser nerdo|`|9q6B5KMxaa	Creo que la del Caliz de Fuego... Me gusto mucho la intervencion de otros colegios y conocer a los otros chicos que al igual que harry son magos pero no pertenecen a Hogwarts, y bueno tambien la competencia fue muy entrenida y buenos efectos...<br>  La que no me gusto mucho fue la segunda La camara secreta... no es que sea mala pero era muy lenta y oscura....<br>  No puedo esperar por ver la nueva La orden del fenix....<br>  Saludos!!!|`|DoCue0HNaa	Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban. Me parece que fue la que mejor hicieron, la historia en sí está muy buena, porque Harry se entera de la existencia de Sirius, y también porque es el pie para el regreso de Voldemort. También en esta empiezan a aparecer personajes que después continúan en el resto de la historia como Lupin. Me gusto porque los chicos están más grandes y les permitío desarrollar más sus personajes, y es más oscura y tiene mayor misterio. Aunque creo que la próxima, La Orden del Fénix, las va a superar a todas.|`|FrdtGrLNaa	Yo creo que el prisionero de azkaban fue la mejor de todas la cuarta no me gusto nada|`|akDQasVvaa	Como han dicho,molan más los libros,pero de entre las pelis, me quedo con la tercera, y eso que en las dos primeras al menos se seguía algo más de cerca al libro, en la tercera ya casi ni se ponen los uniformes...Pero en la tercera, Harry sale más mayor y más tío bueno , y la peli es como más alucinante. XDD|`|jGpbHwvKaa	io creo q la mejor hasta aurita es la cuarta pero cuando ia aian salido todas creo q va a ser la ultima|`|144qItlSaa	Hasta el momento la 4|`|220e9b22445bde24ca5353893d37b1daaa	A mi me gustó mucho la tercer película.|`|2hDcP7kKaa	la neta es que la 4 esta pro pero le quitaron muchos detalles del libro, habra que ver como esta la 5 que ya casi la sacan<br>  <br>  <br>  ailas|`|62KPQGreaa	Para mi que Harry Potter y el Prizionero de Azkaban porque Hermione esta mas tiempo con Harry que con el Cadaver de la Novia de Ron.|`|PiSxLm1Laa	harry potter y el prisionero de azcaban, tanto el libro como la peli son buenisimos.|`|ZI6PFhWeaa	Harry Potter and the Globet of Fire|`|dlGgK1bRaa	la tercera fue la mejor... <br>  <br>  pero no se pueden comparar con los libros|`|fQt0yQ5zaa	Me gusya Harry Potter, pero m gustan m{as los libros de J.K Rowling. En la pel{icula se omiten muchosn detalles.<br>  Pero Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Askaban|`|kAADRVjAaa	Me gustan todas..<br>  pero mas Harry Potter y La Camara de los Secretos =P|`|lmoG4YQzaa	Aunque no se comparan con los libros en mi opinión entre las ya publicadas<br>  Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal del 1 al 10= 8<br>  Harry Potter y la cámara secreta 1 al 10= 8 <br>  Harry Potter y el prisionero de Azkaban 1 al 10= 7.8<br>  Harry Potter y el cáliz de fuego 1 al 10= 9<br>  pero en definitiva los libros son lo mejor <br>  y espero pronto en cine <br>  Harry Potter y la Orden del Fénix<br>  Harry Potter y el misterio del príncipe|`|rho0Afibaa	Ninguna la he visto completa, pero se que es del gusto de muchos.|`|uYqR7rrSaa	todas, mejor son los libros....

Après avoir souffert d'une routine sur quelques semaines, on voit ressortir de nouvelles idées bonnes à prendre.<br>  La présentatrice à la pêche, lacadence est bonne. j'aime bien<br>  <br>  Pour ma part je trouve que la "grosse" emission est mieux pour en prendre plein les yeux, puisque plus de budget.<br>  <br>  L'émission habituelle permet de capter des idées sympas sans avoir un budget de 80k€..

J'ai trouvé une étude déjà super bien faite par une université fran?aise, il ne suffisait qu'a transcrire par nos (on était un binome ) propres mots en anglais. Cet étude est tombé en gros sur la conclusion : le téléchargement prend certes de l'ampleur, mais les plus gros surfeurs qui le font illégalement sont également ceux qui achètent le plus, et l'une des principales raisons est que les lieux formels tels que les magasins ne proposent que très peu de choses qui intéressent les clients, ceux-ci étant attirés par la diversité et la nouveauté que l'on peut trouver sur le net. Peut être que tu tomberas sur la même conclusion. J'ai eu une bonne note en plus, maintenant je suis en deuxième année d' administration économique et sociale. Bonne chance pour la suite !!|`|X6wK0bq8aa	J'ai répondu à ton sondage aussi. Bon courage pour tes études ! Amitiés.|`|c3RO6dCqaa	?a y est j'ai répondu. j'espère que tu auras plein de réponses!!!

When you get a little bit older, high school will seem so insignificant.  What I remember about high school is that all the popular people-don't matter.  All the spoiled kids-become really down to earth.  All the smart kids-are the ones who have the babies.

He uses those powers to find the one who murdered his colleague"<br>  confermo la proposta di WormyDecay: NORTHSTAR.<br>  <br>  Alla prossima !|`|H3Vag8nUaa	Ti accendo la stella così la tua domanda è più visibile, io purtroppo non so aiutarti!

Mi sembra di ricordare che sia di quel periodo...|`|l6a5ZQTqaa	Potrebbe essere "Northstar"? <br>  Qui ti mando la recensione del Morandini: <br>  "Un astronauta ritorna da un viaggio nella Galassia con i cinque sensi ipersensibilizzati a causa di un incidente nello spazio.

f4db2e389d20352ca25790625d5e88a9aa	Yes. The only Ford Transformer shown was the Decepticon called Barricade, who was a 2007 Ford Mustang GT. If you don't believe me, watch the clip below. The Ford logo is removed because the movie only advertises Chevy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808716430/video/3129855/20070622/48/3129855-1000-flash-s.38641209-,3129855-1000-wmv-s.38641192-,3129855-300-wmv-s.38641184-,3129855-700-flash-s.38641205-,3129855-700-wmv-s.38641187-,3129855-100-flash-s.38641197-,3129855-300-flash-s.38641201-,3129855-100-wmv-s.38641183-">http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808716430...</a>|`|a92dc1dee249df6386fa5d3228695a68aa	Yes I believe they did. The newer model mustang was a police car.|`|Mlwd5Bt3aa	No, most of the vechicals in the movie are Chevy, GMC, and Pontiac.|`|XNrbNlewaa	Barricade, apparently. But they obviously had a product placement deal with Chevy, which sucked because Bumblebee is a Volkswagen BEETLE. I can't believe they compromised the character because of that.
Mlwd5Bt3aa	During the credits there was a bunch of stuff that happened:<br>  <br>  There is a news interview with Sams parent's and they just ask about aliens and the government.<br>  <br>  There is scene with Starscene leaving the planet.<br>  <br>  And that is pretty much it.|`|HYRKmLwbaa	Optimus called for more Autobots, Starscream went to get more Decepticons.

qNvPOWymaa	Many reasons. For a video game, as the UK shares the same region as the whole of Europe it usually has to wait until the game is translated. As for a movie, the translation issues don't have to apply but the distributor may delay it to give it the best chance for success.

AA12129729	Last week me and my one friend went to a coffee shop in Centurion and I ordered tea, but I got a dirty cup (with old tea in it!), so I sent it back and when I got my new cup there was a lipstick mark on it. So I called the manager and it took him 10 minutes to get there, so I complained not only about the cups but also about the filthy floor (it was really bad) and also about the tremendous slow service (when we called the waiter, the one customer actually said 'good luck' to us). So we left and when we ordered our tea at the next coffee shop, again I got a cup with a lipstic mark! Lol! Yeah, that was when we burst out laughing, because never before this had happened to any of us. Three dirty cups on one outing at two different places.<br>  <br>  PS. I don't always complain like that, I love to rather give compliments and say thank you like I did today at another coffee shop. We received amazing service in an extremely neat and clean place and I had to thank the manager in person.|`|KT8uUqq8aa	a piece of a dead roach in my food! ugh|`|ZJT3McAhaa	caterpillar in my fruit salad !!|`|u67zCF71aa	Funny story. I was in a Chinese restaurant with my wife and daughter. We all ordered sweet and sour combo plates and as I was eating mine, I found a hair in my mouth. I pulled it out and found that it was a long, straight, black hair like that of Orientals, so I placed it beside my dish and continued eating. Suddenly I found something alien in my mouth and, upon investigation, discovered a fingernail. It looked like it had been chewed off and spat into the meal. Long story short, I finished the meal and didn't pay for it.|`|gVxPhfqHaa	Hair in my food and 1/2 cooked chicken McNuggets.|`|VZZAX5yGaa	Curly Hair in my food....

At one point my dad noticed that one of the chefs aprons hanging on a hook had something moving inside of the front pocket.<br>  <br>  We stared at it for about 5 minutes. Every few seconds something small (maybe a mouse, maybe a rat) would start moving inside this apron pocket. Finally one of the chefs in the back walked toward the apron and began beating it repeatedly with a frying pan until whatever was inside stopped moving.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, we got up and left.

f2da73f26820e41a00db0edf3483a591aa	The reason it failed is because it was an okay movie. Plus, it was mostly Eragon fans who went to see it, i.e. people who read the book. The book >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> the movie. The book and movie were barely related. "Eragon 2" would be Eldest, which was written awhile ago. The last of the trilogy is Empire (unless it has been changed), it is not published yet.|`|19eb83a3ed05abe83db05aafd4055395aa	No, they don't want to do another one since it failed at the box office...........|`|sbQKCAhFaa	An Eragon sequel is possible but since the Eragon movie had scences that were in the book, altered and most of the scences, totally made up, an Elpest (2nd book in the Inheritance series) movie may just be the same and might not be liked some critics who also read the book.

DMSKikL9aa	la mia modestissima opinione....<br>  allora, conosco persone che mi hanno bloccato su msn solo perchè ascolto i finley...      penso ke la gente debba iniziare a crescere un pochino... non è un crimine ascoltare musica, chiunque sia l artista,, esiste l individualità musicale,no???,,il mondo è bello perchè è vario.. e poi è sempre meglio avere un panorama musicale il più possibile completo no??..quindi, ascoltate anche i Finley....<br>  ..e non stupitevi se canzoni che prima odiavate solo a pensare "dei finley", riescono a rispecchiare voi, il vostro modo di fare e vostre eventuali esperienze in molti aspetti...|`|2xlmB6syaa	beh senza offesa per nessuno ma direi che sono un bel po sfi.gatini...^_^|`|4RaVJXcxaa	a me piacciono sono mitici e nn sfigati gome dikono certe oke sono giovani e hanno inniziato da poko la loro carriera e la strada e lunga<br>  pedrokastedani forever|`|FWnUzonTaa	IO li odio..nn so xk..e sopratt odio ki li ama! la musica vera è qll k resta..nn qll delle band k poi scoppiano!|`|a0d5b9ac93e7cced90f41f9f9f80cba6aa	A me non piace la loro musica, ma non mi stanno antipatici...secondo me stanno antipatici a molti o perchè troppa gente ne parla e dopo un po' uno non li sopporta più, o perchè ormai parlare dietro ai Finley fa tendenza|`|aceDkDkhaa	i finley stanno a molti antipatici perche sono nati cosi:<br>  due produttori si incontrano...e uno propone una scommessa: prendo un gruppo che non vale niente e in 2 anni lo faccio entrare nella top ten dei dischi piu venduti....e ha vinto la scommessa....<br>  ci sono gruppi che invece credono nella loro musica e si fanno il culo per anni senza essere notati da nessuno...|`|gh3FBHuDaa	A me piacciono i Finley...sono bravi e poi le loro canzoni sono molto orecchiabili...credo che a molti non piacciono perchè hanno solo 20 anni e sono riusciti a scalare le vette musicali in un nano secondo...beh...beati loro...|`|uXYr4EALaa	NN è ASSOLUTAMENTE VERO KE SN FASCISTI<br>  E POI SN SIMPATICI <br>  FINLEY 4EVER THE BEST|`|si7mu5bgaa	Sono i migliori!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  La gente li considera antipatici perkè sono + fighi di loro!!!!<br>  Ciao Sere|`|12jrcPoYaa	Bè a me non stanno antipatici anzi la loro musica mi piace. L'unica cosa è che la loro musica si presenta spesso molto ripetitiva, sempre lo stesso genere di canzoni.. Comunque non sono gli unici e perciò non è un grande difetto.. Il 28 agosto qui a Bergamo fanno un loro concerto e li vado a vedere! E a te piacciono?<br>  Ciauz!!|`|i0QgRdckaa	stanno antipatici xk molti gruppi dello stesso genere musicale non sono emersi anche se suonano meglio di loro...mentre i finley sono giovanissi e famosi,piu che altro di loro piace l'aspetto e non la musica...|`|H6IOiAtnaa	secondo me i finley sono breavissimi|`|LkGKTsHDaa	Non li conosco molto perchè non è il mio genere, ma Fumo e Cenere è una bella canzone. Penso che stiano antipatici perchè sono stati creati a tavolino e hanno avuto parecchie spinte per arrivare dove sono, ma onestamente penso che non ci sia niente di male. Nessuno al posto loro avrebbe detto "no grazie, non voglio essere famoso...preferisco fare tutto da solo e rischiare di suonare nelle cantine per i prossimi 10 anni!". Non saranno mai un gruppo rock storico ma non fanno niente di male.....meglio loro che altri!|`|hUhm5eyoaa	all'inizio mi piacevano ma ora trovo che siano molto peggiorati|`|wlgqOwPVaa	Fanno schifo!!!!

ypC2x0B9aa	Yes, Tamahome did not die. He does not even exist in the first place. So, the only way for him and Miaka to be together in the real world is for him to be born in the real world, using the power of all the 7 stars. He did, but Miaka only met him when she is in her freshman year and Taka(his name in the real world), 3rd year senior, becomes a friend of her brother. Miaka herself does not know that Tamahome was born into the real world. Her brother, one day,calls her out and tells her that he meets a friend who claims to be a warrior of the Suzaku stars and falls in love with the miko of Suzaku.

UA9L4cVDaa	a real girl named Delilaha that the lead singer wrote a song about, apparently her bf wasn't to happy about that! the lead singer liked her and she jokingly asked him to write a song about her, so he did! it's all really sweet!|`|AA11306050	YOUR MOM|`|kzIdbcZDaa	I just heard them interviewing the singer about this song on the radio actually.  It was a girl he met and stayed up all night with along with another friend at a party.  He thought she was gorgeous.  He said, "I'm going to write a song about you."  they kept in touch (even though she had a boyfriend) and she kept asking, "Hey, where's my song?"  So he finally wrote it, but because he didn't actually know that much about her, he kind of made up a fantasy of having a long distance relationship with her.
AA11306050	just wait until something comes to you. it kind of defeats the purpose if someone tells you what to write about.|`|cCyd74XZaa	you can't write a song on someone elses idea, so just start writing down words that sound appealing to you, if one of them feels like you can write more about it, then start writing down more words that deal with that topic... good luck<br>  <br>  ?We Love You MJ?|`|mJ3w0Lr5aa	Its best to write a song about something thats going on in your life at the moment,  whether it be about a person you love, life , obstacles something that you feel real passionate about.

So, I think that she will be in it.|`|Tu1QMI2Yaa	there WiiLL be a HSM3 and everyone will be in it again accept for Lucas Grabeel [ i think lol ] and miley cyrus will be in it and will have a bigger part than the 2nd onee|`|j6tWRRUjaa	yes|`|jJ0OIowlaa	idk i think she will be but im not sure so yeah|`|2aa8b980843a0d638b818cbbaeecaf0faa	i think so, i heard that disney forgave her.|`|7jxXERbVaa	Well, of course there is gonna be a HSM 3...Disney isn't into morals I guess. I mean I was a fan of Vanessa cuz we look alike. Everytime I see her I think "giant pepperoni nipples" as someone described her, I don't like her as Gabby anymore. I wish I could replace her cuz there are no naked pics of my anywhere. I can sing and dance and act. Wishful thinking I suppose!!|`|WIcYZtdKaa	There will be a third HSM but it will premiere in theaters and if there isn't anymore incidents she'll be in it... but if there are eincidents she will be kicked off fand replaced with a cheetah girl.|`|ZFEySd9Gaa	yes she wil be even though the nude scandal may lead people to think that Vannessa is fired, she is not she apologized many times and was forgiven by disney channel. and many magazines say that there will be a HSM3, it will hve a haunted/spooky/halloween theme, and it will be released on October 08 .|`|ctTlpQXmaa	yes she will be in hsm3 and there will be one because everyone is pretty sure the new theme is like a haunted high school and plus it is their senior year. if disney fired her then zac efron might quit and i wouldnt watch it thye are just going to lower her pay probably but this will be a huge mark on her record because look at britney spear. it is also believed that she sent the pictures to drake bell too.

I think one clear approach is to simply ask. Ask whatever you want to know...and be direct ...but respectful. Be clear about what you are asking as well...like not are you interested in me but "Are you interested in being in a relationship with me?" etc. It may catch him/her off guard depending on who you are dealing with but ....you will get an answer. That way things are clear. <br>  <br>  If you get a no, then you know where you stand. Dont think no means yes...life is too short to play games. If you get a yes...then you can now begin to look at how his or her behavior lines up with his/her desire to be with you. If it fits...keep it going you have made a love connection. If it doesnt....communicate...work on it...pray.  If after all of that it still doesn't fit ...then this person may not be the one for you.<br>  <br>  Be wise...<br>  <br>  I think you can figure out the rest :)

Par contre je regrette la présence de la cruche d'Arielle Dombasle (quelle conne avec sa question sur les cheveux, je l'aurais giflée, le pauvre Dominic a du se demander dans quelle émission de fou il a mis les pieds) et que la hyène de Fogiel coupe la parole sans cesse à Dominic, grrrr<br>  Enfin, ?a m'a fait plaisir de le voir à la télé, je l'ai trouvé génial|`|xRaGyugTaa	pas moi mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm je l'ai raté mais c'est pas très grave parce que ce n'était pas Michel qui est venu hihihi

K86UqHv6aa	cause al gore said so.....and he was almost the boss at one time....<br>  we just need to be nice to mother earth...|`|QbnjaUEJaa	We shouldn't, it is a hoax.<br>  The UN set up the IPCC (intergovernmental panel on climate change) in 1988.  Ever since then – in order to keep their jobs- these “scientists” have sent political report after political report to the press and whoever would actually look at them.  Unfortunately when the AP, Yahoo, or major media looks at these reports they only get the summary and seldom look at the footnotes.  Seldom do the footnotes get put into the news because actual facts may distort what the authors want you to believe.<br>     Unfortunately  "global warming" supporters want to end debate.  The US government and various state Governments have been trying to silence the critics of “Global Warming”.  As more scientists look at the facts more and more scientists believe that “Global warming – with all of its economic ramifications and global tax threats” has little scientific reasoning and it really is a political hoax.

I was probably about nine.<br>  <br>  That ended that. Barry Manilow went in the trash the next day. <br>  <br>  I love my brother, he's pretty cool.

I was listening to Slipknot (yes Slipknot) anyways she walked in and said it was stupid and that the band scared her.  She said I was dumb for liking rock.  This is coming from someone who listens to the top 40 religiously disney crap and finds both lil wayne and solja boi hot.  Well one day I walk into our room and guess who is not only listening but singing (horribly I might add) Slipknot Psychosocial.  My 13 year old sister.  I asked her what she was singing and she quickly turned it to another rap song by lil wayne.  I caught her she is such a little liar. |`|g5DvuTOIaa	 The other day I was with my friend who *says* she hates the Jonas Brothers. I was looking on her iPod, and who should I find on there but the Jonas Brothers. I coughed a couple times and then said quite casually, "So, you have the Jonas Brothers on your iPod." <br>   She scrambled to put together a story. "Oh, uh, you see, I deleted them a while ago, but, uh..." <br>   "But?" I gently prompted. <br>   "But... um... my computer apparently didn't... uh... delete them." <br>   I said, "Mikayla, I have no problem with you liking the Jonas Brothers if you do. Like whoever you want to! But what I do have a problem with is you lying to me, and I can tell you just did. You were a million 'uh's' per sentence." <br>   "Sorry, I guess you are right..." she said. <br>   And before that happened, I would catch her singing snippets of Hannah Montana and the Jonas Brothers. <br>   So, I guess she said she disliked them, and she might have, before then, but after a while, I think she started to like them. <br>   I have caught my dad singing Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love. He does not quite hate Led Zeppelin, but he surely does not love them. He was rather embaressed when I caught him singing those songs. |`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	All the jerks at my school that  have been giving me crap about Led Zeppelin, The Who, AC/DC, The Stones, & The Beatles for years, are currently going through a classic rock phase and acting like they've always loved these bands, the most annoying thing is when they talk about the bands or the musicians like they know anything about them. The only fun I get out of  this is when the boys who have decided ( because of guitar hero) that they are world class guitarists start talking about guitarists from certain bands and I rattle off a name or something and they get a ? expression on there.

They are one of the best selling female groups and R&B groups of all time.<br>  According to RIAA, TLC has sold over 22 million of album copies in the United States alone, making them the second best selling female group and best selling R&B group in American music history. Their second album, CrazySexyCool (1994), was the first album by a female group to be awarded diamond certification by the RIAA for selling over 11 million copies. Billboard ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time. The group was just as well-known for their controversy as well as their success, from their use of condoms as fashion accessories in the early 1990s, to Left-Eye's troubles with both the law and disputes with her groupmates.<br>  In early 2002, just before the release of TLC's fourth LP, 3D, tragedy struck when Lopes was killed in a car accident in Honduras. T-Boz and Chilli promoted 3D as a duo, and in 2005 hosted a reality television show, R U the Girl.

Comme on ne parlait pas la même langue, elle dessine sur le sable deux rectangles. J'ai compris qu'elle voulait mettre sa serviette à coté de la mienne… Plus tard, vers midi, elle dessine dans le sable un c?ne inversé avec deux boules dessus. J'ai compris qu'elle voulait une glace, et je lui ai offert une glace ! Vers 6 heures du soir, elle dessine une assiette avec un couteau et une fourchette, et je l'ai invité à souper. A la fin du repas, elle dessine sur la nappe un lit avec une table de chevet et une lampe, et la je n'ai pas bien compris…<br>  - Quoi ?<br>  - Comment elle savait que je travaillais chez " Monsieur Meubles " !|`|CvsSo6ylaa	C cool , jè aimé|`|HOZjA3yEaa	mdr!!!!!!!!!!!!!jai du la lire deux foit pour comprendre lol excellente !!|`|xRaGyugTaa	hiihihiihhihiihihi|`|oZO4pZVmaa	deja lu mais sa me fait toujours rire....|`|85a60481e390a88c49b05b9866ca562faa	Yeah!!!!

O5uq5El6aa	i sing in a metal band and heres how i scream. first off do not do it the same way you sing cuz you will really tear up your vocal chords. you need to actually scream(or yell) but you need to do so while useing your diphraghm and the most important thing...DO NOT FORCE IT AND IF IT HURTS STOP! there is a better way to do it. also if you kinda push from the muscle right below your bellybutton it will make it come out easier but it kinda makes you feel like you gotta poo. but after you get used to it and get it down the feeling will go away. <br>  one of the biggest things also is to not think about it. ive found that when i am just there and in the moment type deal with my voice it sounds better and just kinda flows out. (guess that goes with what i said before dont force it)<br>  <br>  this like anything else takes time and alot of pratice. the first few times you do it you will probably loose your voice but it will fall into place. i mean when i first started i did it by trial and error and probably did a number on my chords. for like 3 months id loose my voice every pratice. <br>  also theres this dvd (the zen of screaming) i got it after i learned how to scream and i found out i figured the right way to do it already but it still had some good tips and stuff. not bad to have especially for the vocal warmups. also i have an article that ive written that goes more in depth if you want me to email it to you get ahold of me.<br>  if this helps or if you have anymore questions you can email me at <br>  captn_saliga@yahoo|`|pYF7LsUNaa	screamo as in like..august burns red?!

AlCmuKypaa	compared to other bands people mention over and over ......and over.........and over (floyd, zep, queen, etc.) <br>  We can say Cream is Underrated , but they  have also received the recognition  from the real connosieurs.<br>  <br>  I love them|`|YrVDEmUUaa	Underrated.

They made music that kicked a$$, not to mention they were all amazing at their respective instrument.|`|AA11093315	Eric Clapton's Cream is... well... CREAMY!|`|22LckyOTaa	Underrated.|`|UldvbAIWaa	its all about preference you may think one band is better than the other than 90000 people maybe against that. you can only decide for your self.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I think they are just slightly overrated.  If Cream had any other guitarist than Clapton, then they were nothing.  Clapton made that band, and I think Cream gets credit just because they had him.

C7YbYUYPaa	Basically, just jam out a little and get a feel for your strings and strumming.  It will help you when you get into lessons if you already worked your fingers out a little.<br>  <br>  The easiest song I can recommend tabs wise is Down On The Corner by Creedence Clearwater Revival.<br>  <br>  Ultimateguiar.com is the best website for tabs<br>  911tabs.com is a good one also.<br>  <br>  Like I said before, just jam out a little, experiment on all kinds of different frets and slides and whatever else you want to try.  Get your fingers a little calused and stretched out, and you will be a little further ahead than your teacher will expect.<br>  <br>  Have fun, it is the most important part!|`|7C2IvJouaa	You should really get to know your guitar before you start lessons with it.<br>  How far can you bend a certain string?<br>  How easy is it to tune?<br>  This may not be important yet but - Can you find and play all of the harmonics across the strings?

TKiuefelaa	I used to have Janet Jackson's "Control" and "Rhythm Nation 1814" on record, but I sold them on eBay a few years ago. Other than that, I have never owned any records.|`|ecywznKRaa	Lmao I think I have Michael Jackson, but it's my parents.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	No. I'm not old enough to have owned records because I am 15.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	I used to have a record collection. My collection was destroyed a few years ago when we had a bad storm that flooded out our basement. (sob!) my old records were destroyed, and I also lost pictures of me through the years (including my first marriage, but maybe that wasn't such a terrible thing)<br>  <br>  When my dad passed away, I went through his collection and found the usual suspects: Johnny Mathis, Engelbert Humperdink, Freddy Fender and Harry Belafonte. Don't you know I found a Rod Stewart record in there? I gave it to my niece, because I love her and I am a cool aunt. (she is 16 and into classic rock too)|`|ssoZ33XIaa	My parents have 150 or so that I steal a lot.  They've got most of The Beatles albums, a bunch by The Who, Chicago, Yes, and a ton by Neil Diamond.  My Mom loves Neil Diamond.  I was looking through them yesterday, there are a lot of movie and musical soundtracks as well, and a really good version of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.|`|nU7yv87Vaa	My parents own quite a few... my favorites being:<br>  <br>  Led Zeppelin II<br>  The Wall (Pink Floyd)<br>  Breakfast in America (Supertramp)<br>  High 'n' Dry (Def Leppard)<br>  Rock in a Hard Place (Aerosmith)<br>  Malice in Wonderland (Nazareth)...

It ranges from John Lennon's "Imagine", to The Doors "The Soft Parade', to Pink Floyd's "The Wall". I love records! Whenever I go to San Francisco, I always visit the Amoeba records store in the Haight. It's amazing. Peace!|`|8Hxyp9fRaa	The Clash -- Combat Rock<br>  Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band -- Trouble Is...<br>  Jethro Tull -- Stand Up<br>  Cheech And Chong -- Big Bambu lol<br>  <br>  there's hella more.

S66gFfcpaa	Honestly thats an odd problem to have with Windows Movie Maker.  With me it works just fine.  What kind of file was your music file?  Maybe you had one that was not supported by the version you had.  Now youve upgraed and find that your video file isnt supported?  I think you would be best off going back to the old version and trying to convert your music  file to one of the fomats that are in the supported list.  Thats the best thing to do.  .mp3 should always work. Works with me.  Hope that helps.  I want some grape drink now.|`|HVRo3XeAaa	First, deep breath.<br>  Did you read the help manual? I had trouble with something similar on Movie Maker and found the help in the manual.<br>  Good luck.

whbvpsUuaa	Very STUBBORN and self-indulgent--that's from 4 1/2 years of experience of dating a Taurus male but not every one is the same....|`|0sBkAFqSaa	Knowing several individuals who are Taurus I can say that although they may seem stubborn at times - that stubbornness has a good quality.  They are not quitters.  The people who I know can be counted on to complete a job.  Plus, that "stubbornness" quality gives them the nature not to jump to conclusions to stand firm in their convictions.   They are firm in what they believe in.  So Taurus, don't let anyone bully you into thinking that being stubborn is a bad thing.|`|aYDObT1Laa	stubborn , loving,|`|8K6GVDwfaa	i edont know|`|Uzg09g2laa	extremely boring and lazy!<br>  <br>  bull-headed and bossy!<br>  <br>  love to smile and laugh and occasionally entertain at home!|`|XqfH76PMaa	You are awesome!  Taurus people are great (even if they are stubborn).|`|a5wXWGSLaa	I would luv 2 say dat my cousin bro is also Taraus!!<br>  LOg on  2 www.horoscope.com n see wat u can get dere!|`|4diqCegvaa	Hi Vickey just go through it..........<br>  Taurus Astrology April 20 - May 20<br>  Taurus Strength Keywords:<br>  - Dependable<br>  - Persistent<br>  - Loyal<br>  - Patient<br>  - Generous<br>  Taurus Weakness Keywords:<br>  - Stubborn<br>  - Laziness<br>  - Possessive<br>  - Materialistic<br>  - Self-indulging<br>  Taurus and Independence:<br>  Taurus is not the one who ventures out into the unknown and leads the way, Taurus is<br>  the one that will follow the leader and strengthen and build upon the discovered, in<br>  other words they are the one that will "dot the I's and cross the T's". This perseverance<br>  is given to them by their stubborn streak. Taurus stubborn streak is what gives their<br>  independence. They like to do things their way. They are perfectly fine on being<br>  alone, this way things get done they way they want them to be done. Taurus is not a<br>  follower, but they are not the brave one either. Taurus is perfectly independent. With<br>  their perseverance, they get things done and can do quite well for themselves.<br>  Taurus and Friendship:<br>  A Taurus is an excellent friend. Taurus has few close friends as opposed to many<br>  acquaintances. The few people they hold dear to them are guarded and protected.<br>  Their friends are treated like family and they are fiercely loyal and dependable.<br>  Taurus loves to be the host or hostess. Although not a total social butterfly, they can<br>  be shy around strangers, the people who Taurus let into their lives are lavishly catered<br>  to when Taurus decides to throw a party, they decorate and present everything<br>  lavishly. Taurus will always pamper themselves and their close group of friends.<br>  Taurus and Business:<br>  Taurus is a strong business person. Taurus is the one who has immense perseverance,<br>  even when others have given up, the Taurus rages on. They have a knack for finance<br>  and their financial advice is prized. They know where money is to be made and have<br>  the ability to manipulate and set the path for their own success. Taurus are not<br>  frivolous spenders but they like to live lavishly and surround themselves with nice<br>  possessions and foods, which all adds up resulting in large spending habits. They will<br>  not spend all their money and cause their business to fail because if they do, their<br>  security and stability will be gone and this will cause them great stress.<br>  Taurus Temperament:<br>  Taurus are deeply sensitive, the slightest comment or negative remark will be taken<br>  personally and they can easily get offended or hurt. Their stubborn streak results in<br>  laziness. They can be very lazy when someone gives them orders or wants them to do<br>  something they do not want to do. They are not lazy when it comes to themselves,<br>  Taurus Deep Inside:<br>  Taurus are not fond of change. In fact, is change is imminent, they get very nervous<br>  and worried. They do not like anything new because anything new is unknown and<br>  Taurus fears the unknown. Taurus needs order in their lives and when they do not<br>  have order, they get very anxious. Taurus will cut themselves off from the unfamiliar<br>  in order to avoid the feelings of insecurity that arise when new experiences and<br>  situations are present. Taurus do not express their feelings openly and their inner self<br>  is contained and secretive. Many people do not know how sensitive Taurus really is,<br>  they hide it well. As a result, they are often emotionally hurt when the wrong things<br>  are said, they take things too personally sometimes. Taurus avoids talking about their<br>  emotions and many people never really know how they feel.<br>  Taurus in a Nutshell:<br>  Taurus is the one who has immense perseverance, even when others have given up,<br>  the Taurus rages on. Solid and persistent, just like the bull, which is Taurus' well<br>  suited symbol. Taurus's have a well known reputation for being stubborn, which is not<br>  necessarily a bad thing. The stubborn streak can cause Taurus to butt heads and<br>  conflict with other strong character types. Taurus are not fond of change. They like<br>  the familiar and routine comfort of life. Taurus is easy going and not one to pick a<br>  fight but should some poor souls attempt to provoke Taurus, the wrath will be known,<br>  for they have a temper underneath the calm surface. Taurus are very responsive to<br>  their surroundings. They like decorations, color, anything that appeals to all the<br>  senses. Taurus like possessions and the Taurus home is nicely decorated with lots of<br>  things. Taurus are down to earth, they do not like gaudy, flashy or over the top things.<br>  They prefer comfortable and creative settings and objects. Taurus likes security, in<br>  every aspect of their lives from home, to love, to career. Taurus can be secretive,<br>  opinionated and stingy. Taurus tend to be self-indulgent and lazy, Taurus are master<br>  procrastinators of the astrology zodiac! They do however have a strong, persistent<br>  drive that comes to life when they chose, and no one would ever know that they are<br>  lazy. The secret to this is that their laziness is pushed aside when it comes to<br>  themselves.<br>  Taurus Love, Sex and Relationships<br>  What it's like to date a Taurus Woman:<br>  Taurus women are masters in the art of seduction. She will get what she wants but her<br>  patience is incredible, she will wait for what she wants She needs stability and<br>  security and will not tolerate a man who is not straight with her and leads her along<br>  with uncertainty in the future. She is the old-fashioned type, the type of woman who<br>  is associated with the drive-in soda shop days of the 60's. She is down to earth,<br>  protective, supportive, loving, devoted and loyal. She is openly affectionate in a<br>  relationship. Taurus women is perfect for the man who likes to be nurtured and<br>  pampered, providing you are loyal and devoted. She has a lot to give but she requires<br>  a lot in return. Remember, the Taurus woman is very sensitive although she might not<br>  seem so on the exterior. Court her and constantly try to impress her and you will win<br>  her heart and she will be yours. Cross a Taurus woman, and her temper will flare, she<br>  will become extremely stubborn. If you ever break her trust, it will be nearly<br>  impossible to gain it back again.<br>  What it's like to date a Taurus Man:<br>  The Taurus man is very sensible, he is not the man to sweep you off your feet. He is<br>  practical and down to earth. He wants a high quality woman, not a woman for one<br>  night. He will survey cautiously before he makes his approach. He is very patient<br>  when it comes to a relationship. He will survey the situation and make sure the<br>  woman has something to offer him, before he offers himself. Taurus man is a<br>  romantic man, he will put his woman on a pedestal, protect her and cherish her. Once<br>  he has chosen his woman, he will be very generous, loyal and faithful. He is not a<br>  boring man, but he is not for the woman who craves adventure and excitement.<br>  Taurus man is for the woman who craves stability and comfort, he is an incredible<br>  provider and is a very fine choice as a partner for the right woman. He is in it for the<br>  long haul so commitment is no problem for this man.<br>  How To Attract Taurus:<br>  Do not attempt to rush into a relationship with Taurus. They are very patient and<br>  expect you to be so too. Make them laugh, if they are amused and entertained by you,<br>  they will enjoy being with you. The way to a Taurus' heart is through their stomachs.<br>  Cook for them or offer to take them to a fine upscale restaurant. Taurus enjoy talking<br>  about finance, business, money and material possessions.<br>  Taurus Erogenous Zone:<br>  The throat and neck are the hot spots for any Taurus. Lightly rub the neck, kiss it<br>  gently, lick it lightly, even a soft nipple will make them melt like butter! Massage the<br>  back of the neck while you are relaxing, this relax them and set the mood for passion!<br>  Sex With Taurus:<br>  They are passionate lovers. They have lots of physical stamina and this makes up for<br>  the lack of variety in the sex life.|`|IvTwmKsMaa	Generally , taraus  person is make many friend but he/she can not talk his/her feelings.<br>  they are very fancy & interested in music, dance.<br>  They prey the God as a person( making relation as friend or brother etc.)  <br>  they always tey to attract opposite sex person.cant't express their feelings.<br>  Generally they are cool but when get angry they can't control himself/herself.<br>  lookwise beutiful and attractive.|`|JSaj6cwZaa	go to <br>  www.astrology-insight.com(forward slash)taurus.html<br>  <br>  it will give you alot of insight :)|`|UCsoqGeFaa	aggressive,Loves being in long relationships,likes to have a good fight for wat dey want.Extremely out going........Loves to help ppl in times of need............GOOD KISSER.............Good personality.Stubborn.......A caring person.

Il video è girato come fosse un filmato amatoriale, in cui il cantante del gruppo Giuliano Sangiorgi, gira per le strade della capitale, riprendendosi da solo, mentre canta il brano.

Bon Jovi are the creators of two of the best albums ever: Slippery and New Jersey, and they have one of the the best three songs of all time: Livin' on a prayer... They are the band that have earned more money this year with their tour... Their live performances show how huge they are, and the way how they respect their fans.|`|aqqkGf7Gaa	Guns 'N Roses no competition there. not even close|`|GbJvTQ1qaa	Guns N Roses|`|AA10297617	GNR
C7YbYUYPaa	First of all, you'll get better answers in the games section....<br>  <br>  Since I'm a good guy, I'll give a little help.<br>  <br>  Rock band 2 is only slightly different from the first one.  In 2, you can actually do the band world tour by yourself, and then if others want to jump in, they can.  Also, you can use the same character to play any instrument, so you don't have to play only guitar the whole time.<br>  <br>  The songs are good overall, with the highlights being Pinball Wizard, Carry On My Wayward Son, Any Way You Want It, Go Your Own Way, and Round and Round.  Some of the songs aren't great, but they are overall good.  It even has a song from Guns n Roses Chinese Democracy album on it.|`|2i6TPlauaa	You're in the wrong section.<br>  <br>  <br>  By fave I think you mean Favorite. Huh?
C7YbYUYPaa	I used to have it too.<br>  <br>  I started the ringtone at about the 1:30 mark.  It is right when he says, "cuz this is Thriller.....<br>  <br>  Good choice of ringer.
