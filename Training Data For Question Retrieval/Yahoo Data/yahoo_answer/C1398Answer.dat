Feminism was at its height of power back in the 80s, Universities and colleges were filled with professors, who were feminist at heart. This had an effect on student population, especially young women, who admired successful women and dreamed to be as successful. Once reality set in after graduating, marrying, and having children, feminism looked mean spirited, especially for mothers, nevertheless it gave women the option of being a big paycheck earner rather than a mother. In today's hyper competitive world, women found out it took a lot of energy, courage, luck, social skills, and brilliance to bring home a lot of money. To be always in competition is tiring. It has had a negative impact on young men who were cut down in their careers by feminist for the simple reason they were men and a negative impact on young women who weren't brillant enough to followed their dream imposed by feminist.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	My thoughts are I do not equate feminism necessary with material greed.

MbKQ5Xc0aa	hi,cognitive behaviour therapy will allow one to become aware of his own actions and analyze it and try to change negative attitude towards self, future and surroundings|`|hYZIYla0aa	While the underlying theory of cognitive behavioral management is related to social learning theory, there are many theoretical constructs which concern us in delineating a full understanding of how it is used. While it is relatively easy to suggest that thought controls behavior, meaning of course, that if you believe that you are superman, you will try to fly, this simple construct is not easy. It requires much more, because in many senses it is self reflective. Not only do we need to help people with problems in living learn to attend to their internal dialogue as a means to making choices about change, but we must understand that as theorists and clinicians, we must also attend and make choices. The simple becomes difficult when we attempt to break through our own belief systems and deal with the dichotomies of our own internal realities and those of a broader world perspective. In order to help you examine these issues we include short papers on a a varity of subjects. <br>  <br>  Abstracts Available: <br>  <br>  There are no Abstracts for Quick Concepts and the Language of Change. <br>  <br>  Consciousness:  In 1988 Bernard J. Baars published A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness which provides the final piece of our theoretical puzzle. The book is concerned with conscious and nonconscious processes. Consciousness is not something we can observe directly, other than in ourselves, and then only in retrospect. However, the fact that we can predict with considerable confidence indicates that conscious experience is something knowable. <br>  <br>  A Biological Theory To Underpin Cognitive Behavior Management: There are fundamental laws about complex systems, but they are new kinds of laws. They are laws of structure and organization and scale, and they simply vanish when you focus on the individual constituents of a complex system - just as the psychology of a lynch mob vanishes when you interview individual participants." the brain-mind question is, according to one neurologist, a question of the survival of the fittest. Perceptual categorization is the first step, and it is crucial for learning, but is not something fixed, something that occurs once and for all. The evolution of thought allows for learning. <br>  <br>  Precepts & Concepts: Based on theoretical work by Hofstadter the process of getting from perceptions to conceptions involves what begins randomly from the bottoms-up. As the organism is able to experience objects and relations, a knowledge base is created upon which meaning and value can be abstracted. As experiences and events gain meaning and value, the process becomes increasingly top down as the mind in attempt at an orderly process influences perception though beliefs, goals and external process - we perceive more and more of what we expect to perceive. <br>  <br>  Belief Systems: What people believe to be true is that which is coherent to their already established cache of truisms. This cache is developed over time and is significantly shaped by the significant people in the environment. Its development is monitored by the rigor with which each new proposition is analyzed in relationship to what already exists. But the child who has a poorly developed set of logical skills; whose information cache is personalized and moralized; and has little energy to deal with noncoherent propositions, will develop a reality which very likely depreciates his/her self concept which is likely to result in antisocial behaviors which set in motion a reality [pragmatics] which reinforces this perspective.<br>  <br>  Communication: The human behavior stream is contingent upon communication for social learning and the development of personal mental schema about, among other things, self, others and future prospects. Communication and information are coterminous constructs. Communication is information; and information is the means of communicating. Since communication has two distinct poles: the conveyor of information and the receiver of information; precepts become an important part of the creation of concepts. Thus the perception becomes a part of the communication process. What happens between perception and conception is also interesting. <br>  <br>  Culture: The scientific study of human social life must concern itself with two different kinds of phenomena. On one hand, there are the thoughts and feelings that humans experience within their minds; on the other, there are the activities that constitute the human behavior stream. The relationship between mental and physical behavior events are significant.

AA11456316	I can sort of relate as jealousy is also against my faith. In times like these that's easy. I live in Los Angeles, specifically the western portion where it seems as if everyone is recession proof, except us. Yes I worry about money more than ever now, I wanted to buy a home, instead I sit and watch the stocks I inherited plummet and a down payment kinda goes down the drain. <br>  <br>  The best thing I find is my hope in Christ, that's where I turn. And also I just think about the past.<br>  <br>  In the early 90's my dad got laid off on his birthday. He was definitely the bread winner of the home, providing the house payment, and everything else while my mom provided only food. He was out for a little while and then after some hard searching found a job and has been there since thankfully. And he says to this day how depressed he got, the fears of maybe not finding a job, etc. But remember there is always something out there.<br>  <br>  Try looking for a temp position on craigslist.com in your area, that's a good source. Even create an account on there and post your resume, along with monster.com and career builder. Also just post what you do in the general services offered portion of craigslist to see what you might get. Something's coming! unfortunately I think during these times you just have to be patient!|`|XCvQnantaa	go eat some pancakes

Something must be wrong with your mind in order for you to have a physical condition. But then, there's no such thing as a mental condition because the mind doesn't exist.. even if it does, YOU are creating all the thoughts. You can't say, Oh, I'm suffering from depression, so I need therapy. You're not depressed, you just think you're depressed. So in the end, there aren't any kind of conditions at all.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	i agree that most teenagers and young adults are over medicated and do not actually have the conditions; however, there are plenty of people who do have these conditions. the conditions do exist they are just over diagnosed|`|8HmULotpaa	These conditions do exist.  <br>  <br>  Just because the pills don't work does not mean that the person does not have the condition.  There are so many different medications for these conditions.  Everyone has a slightly different chemical make up, and different reactions.  For the same reason why some people get severe side effects when they take a medication and some dont get any, everyone will react differently.  Sometimes you have to try a few different medications and different doses to get the right one.  <br>  <br>  Diagnosis of these conditions has increased, but it is not nessesarily a bad thing.  As we learn more in science and medicine we learn more about the brain and how it works and the things that can go wrong with it.  In the 21st century we are better at recognising these conditions.  In the old days many of these people were left to struggle in life, dealt with unemployment and ruined relationships and often jail sentences.  but now we can understand their conditions and treat them, and give them a chance at a real life.<br>  <br>  It is actually crazy that people think these conditions don't exist.  Every single part of the human body can malfunction. If the eyes malfunction we struggle to see, if the ears malfunction we struggle to hear.  The brain is also an organn of the body and it too can malfunction.  The brain has many parts and it does many different things.  And just like any other part of the body it can malfunction.<br>  <br>  Some chemicals i nour brain help us with our behaviour and others with our moods.  It is crazy to say that these parts of our body can't malfunction when all the other parts can, this is not the one magical body part that can't malfunction.<br>  <br>  Depression is a true condition, everyone feels sad from time to time but but if our chemcials are working correctly they will naturally balance themselves out and they will feel good again eventually.  But for those with depression these chemicals don't balance out properly and they can't feel happy again without some help.<br>  <br>  These conditions are not just diagnosed frequently in the united states but also in all other western countries like Australia, new Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.  These conditons are not diagnosed as often in low income countries but they do exist just as much.  But in those countries people can't afford doctors, and testing and medications.  <br>  <br>  When people say you can't have a mental condition because you create the thoughts this is niave,  There are many things the brain does automatically which those with some conditions can't do.<br>  <br>  Take ADHD for example.  If someone tells you to stop doing something, you don't just stop doing it.  Your brain automatically comes up with a picture of what good behavior to replace the bad one with.  Like if you said to yourself to stop speeding your brain would automatically come up with the picture to slow down and put your foot on the brake.  You don't think this delibratly, you dont control this thought.  An ADHD child doesn't automatically get this picture.<br>  <br>  These problems are medical problems and they do need medical treatment.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	my father insisted there was nothing wrong with him but he would often go through my things insisting that I stole his tools and wake everyone up in the middle of the night asking who went outside.  Random crazy stuff that obviously was not normal.  He was also very emotionally abusive and would randomly get really hateful then be nice 2 seconds later.  <br>  <br>  Some people do not have the mental conditions their doctors try to treat them for which is why it doesn't work.  A lot of doctors shove pills at everyone's problems instead of trying to fix them.  Some people really have problems though.  They do exist, they're just hard to diagnose correctly and everyone is different.|`|0YQRbq9faa	You have to distinguish is the person having a medical problem or a spiritual/emotional/behavioral problem.<br>  <br>  Psychiatric problems are treated with medication.  When the person is on the meds, there is generally a vast improvement over time in their functioning and ability to live their life with their condition.<br>  <br>  If the meds are not working at all, then the problem is spiritual/emotional/behavioral and that is where the solution lies. You have to change the behavior of the person by changing their thinking and thought processes.<br>  <br>  Depression is caused by depressing or pushing down inside problems that we don't want to deal with in life.  The more we chose to avoid our problems and just stuff them inside, the more depressed we get.  Meds don't work for normal problems in life. They work for medical problems.  <br>  <br>  You have to learn problem solving skills to handle your problem, then you will not become so distraught and upset that the body tries to calm you down by depressing the problems that are causing you to overheat emotionally.  Get to the root of the problems they are denying, and the depression and anxiety will lift.<br>  <br>  As far as ADHD. The meds only go so far.  He needs to learn self-discipline and to learn he cannot act on every impulse he feels at any given time, no matter how strong the impulse to act is i.e. you can't just act out whenever you feel a strong impulse to act out.  You have to learn to control it.  <br>  <br>  Very active people with lots of energy are pretty hyper and usually very creative as children.  I was pretty hyper as a child according to my parents.  I had to learn how to focus my attention on the task that is put in front of me and forget everything else.  Forget all the impulses you feel to act or speak out and focus on one thing at a time is the goal.<br>  <br>  All my early report cards said that I was a very bright boy but I talk too much.  I was bored.  I would finish my work quickly and had to sit and wait for the class and the teacher.  I was full of energy and creativity, and loved to talk (I still do).  But my parents basically spanked me when I would act out, and rewarded me when I did right (McDonalds, Pizza, Chocolate ice cream - they are still my favorites today.)  <br>  <br>  You need to have a disciplined home that helps him internalize that discipline and channel all that energy into doing the tasks he has at hand.  Every major action should have a clear, consistent consequence.  <br>  <br>  Speed drills work.  Have him do something as fast as he can; but as good as he can, to burn up that extra energy.  How fast can he make his bed neatly.  How fast can he vaccumm the house neatly.  How fast can he set the table.  How fast can he do his homework.  Also, get him involved in sports.  Coaches know how to yell at and discipline young boys so that they pay attention, stay focused, and work together as a team.  Don't baby him and let him drop out.  It is the discipline of the coach and the sport that he needs as well as the fellowship with other hyper or energetic young boys.<br>  <br>  Those are my suggestions for you.  May the Lord help you as you work these things out.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	I concur with you.<br>  The notion of "chemical imbalances" is absurd.  Sure, chemicals have pretty much everything to do with how we think and feel.  But we do have a degree of control.  A good actor can really make himself cry.  People who lose their temper easily can learn to control their anger.  These emotions are all a manifest of chemicals.<br>  I could never admit that depression is a medical condition.  You know what depression is?  It means you're really sad all the time.  Is it really a surprise so many people feel like this with the world the way it is these days?  Depression, ADD, etc. is big in the United States.  Third world nations don't have these issues (they've got more important things to worry about).

But that doesn't mean that we are superior; we're just intended for different functions. <br>  <br>  For example, look at gorillas. The male gorillas are the stronger ones, who hunt and protect the family. Through evolution, the same principle has applied to humans. <br>  <br>  But that doesn't mean the same gender roles should be applied to humans, as we have grown to possess a higher intelligence, and therefore can make the choice, female or male, as to whether we protect and bring food for the family, or care for the family. <br>  <br>  In the end, no gender is 'better' than the other. We are one. We work as a unit, it's just that we are intended for different things.|`|XeH5FPM5aa	Logically speaking this is true. That is because feminists claim that men and women are cognitively equivalent (despite the paucity of female achievement).

All the strength in the world can't birth new humans.<br>  <br>  A group of 9 women and 1 man has a far better chance of propagating than 9 men and 1 woman.

You obviously practice misandry quite openly. Misandry belittles women and their rights. <br>  <br>  Strength is irrelevant in gender relations.  Although it certainly is a turn on for many women. Females are completely superior to males in terms of power in the courts, divorces, workplace, churches, media, etc. Women RULE! Suggesting anything to the contrary is like calling China a democracy.<br>  <br>  Genders should be treated equally in all respects, but that is not the case.. <br>  <br>  The concept of human superiority is only relevant in bigoted societies such as Nazi Germany, India's caste system, slave cultures, etc. I sincerely hope that your version of feminism does not stoop to such disturbing views.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both genders must be be treated equally in all respects.<br>  <br>  Please don't be offended by my reference to misandry. Your questions imply that superiority must exist in some fashion or another, be it men or women.  The notion that sperm has something to do with the  bigoted concept of human superiority is demeaning to men and absurd.   <br>  <br>  I am very disturbed by the notion of  human  "superiority". <br>  A long time ago my relatives got a first hand education in what it means to be in the not superior group. <br>  <br>  Yes it has a subtle but distinct misandry flavor to it.<br>  .|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Wanna arm wrestle ?, can you hand me that bag of concrete please ?<br>  Will you carry me over the theshold?<br>  <br>  It aint everything , but it's pretty phuck'n cool|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I don't know but thinking of a nice upper body and sperm got me a little hot & bothered <3|`|3buQDaRDaa	In terms of physical strength men are superior to women, but physical strength is only one of many various categories of strength. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2007/11/ouch-men-have-higher-pain-threshold.html" rel="nofollow">http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/...</a>|`|ndopqX6Taa	Just means stronger, that is it.

1ZuF9FdSaa	There is a unspoken law that people in a culture abide by, they are meek and live by these "rules".  The idea is that if you don't live by these rules then you are not being respectful of everyone else because they have chosen to live meekly and so you should, too.  The ones who break out of the mold are looked down upon because they are seen as egocentric, trying to get attention and only thinking of themselves, not of the society as a whole.  This is true even if their actions are not actually hurting anyone, simply because their behavior is outside normal parameters.  Another underlying concept is that people want security. If you are the type of crazy person who would burst into song on a crowded public public bus, what's to say you are not the same sort of crazy person who would shoot bursts of automatic gunfire into a crowded public bus?  People want normal because it's safe.  People like crazy and zany as well, just as long as it is safe.  That's why your crazy uncle Ernie is okay, but the singing on the bus guy is not.

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Interesting question...I've always wondered why so many of the main that rail against feminism don't get organized (key word: organized)  and start their own movement.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "Men are comfortable with their insecurities"...is that  a good thing?|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	What injustices do they face en masse to warrant a march as a gender?<br>  Absolutely none, as a class issue, men, working men strike, march for jobs, as a race, black men have marched...Civil Rights, Million Man etc...but they do not face oppression as a gender. So, when they sit there smugly telling themselves they do but don't need to take to the streets, they are deluded!<br>  Definition riot...women are reknown for hurtling up and down streets hurling stones and molotov cocktails at the police to protest for rape laws or some fundamental human right...riots and marches..some of you are funny!|`|rD0ATcX5aa	...because when a large number of angry women get together, its a protest... when a large group of angry men get together, its called a riot, and the police show up with riot gear and pepper spray...|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I think CloudCity put it best.  The police would be all over something like that.  Actually, maybe that would be a good way to get attention.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Why march when there's the Internet? Most of the MRA just set up websites to try to convince others.|`|R7ACldBKaa	What do we need to march for?|`|xCd7m5dkaa	Because men and MRA's have full time jobs and other responsibilities.<br>  <br>  They don't waste time on marches.
bR4BgFLlaa	I consider myself a feminist and I (and Germaine Greer) would say that these particular activities are not necessarily liberating for women. I certainly don't 'hail' this kind of behavior. At the same time I have nothing against strippers of either sex if that's what you're into. I think its actually patronizing to the stripper to assume that they are being exploited. Women acting like men is not an example of feminism in action. Feminism is about equality, not being the same - being equal.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	The question is, "What do feminists consider politically incorrect"?  I highly doubt that feminists are up in arms about female strippers.  If anything, it would be non-feminist women that complain about female strippers.<br>  <br>  As for paying for sex, again, there are many feminists that aren't against prostitution for either sex, provided that both parties are having safe sex and are both of age.  <br>  <br>  I think you're getting 'women' and 'feminists' mixed up.  Not all women are feminists, and not all feminists are women.|`|auegTf2iaa	Well, its all about the desire-ability factor.... Most,  like foreign women b/c they are tighter down there..  Most western women start having sex when they are like 12 ( b/c of the break-down of the American family ) so by the time they hit 20ish and up they are loose.. Most foreign men know this, thats why they are not that desirable..|`|OGCohFyNaa	I don't know about most feminists, but I don't think that's necessarily true for myself. I don't think that would be an admirable thing to do for a woman anymore than I would for a man. <br>  I can see how women doing certain things that would be considered normal for a man would be considered admirable - like a really talented woman carpenter or something like that, something that sort of breaks the mold or stereotype. But in the same respect, I think that men who break the mold by being really good stay-at-home dads and things of that nature are just as cool.<br>  I don't know - I guess I'm more into equal rights than I am specifically women's rights. I do agree that anyone who thinks it's cool for women to do what's not really acceptable for men to do is wrong - but I also believe the flipside for that.

If you read the actual dialogue, it's pretty clear that Socrates was just using it as a metaphor.  He did that a lot, and it's no different with Antlantis.  He made it up in the same way he made up the cave and the two horses and all the rest.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I think Homer was referring to Santorini or other Phoenicians  The stories beyond the straights of Gibraltar could have been stories from people who saw parts of America.  They could have gotten mixed up especially if the Phoenicians were the ones who visited the new word and told the stories.

8d8ejHPfaa	That you're going through relationship problems with your current boyfriend is an important clue here.  I'm not sure why you are calling him your "deceased ex-boyfriend"  were you still going together when he died, are you calling him your ex boyfriend because he is out of your life, or was he your ex boyfriend before he died? <br>  Based on the tone of your post, I am going to go with the notion that you were still going together at the time he died, and you call him ex boyfriend as a past relationship.<br>  If you were doing well with your deceased boyfriend at the time he died, even though you have moved on now, there may be a tendency to remember this relationship in a sort of idealized bubble.  If you're going through troubles in your current relationship , in your dream you may have mentally returned to a time in your life when things were simpler, and you were young and in love.  I don't think he's come back from the grave to tell you anything, but you miss his support and the time you had together, in contrast to what you're currently going through.

Your conversation seems more fluid initially.<br>  <br>  But as you continue to drink and talk, you gradually lose control.  <br>  <br>  As to speaking with beautiful women, you'd be surprised how many are just as uncomfortable.  How many are alone because men wont approach them thinking they (The women) are too good for him, so he gives up before trying.<br>  <br>  I am not what most would consider "FINE" or one of the beautiful people.  Yet I have been involved with some extraordinary women all because I am self-assured, and was willing simply to approach them fearlessly.  YES, I was rejected at times. Yes, because I was bold and in a few cases, blunt about what I wanted, I received slaps.

1ZuF9FdSaa	This is a natural reaction to death.  There are five stages to dealing with death:<br>  Denial<br>  Anger<br>  Bargaining<br>  Depression<br>  Acceptance<br>  <br>  These stages are true for people who know they are going to die (like with a terminal illness) or for people who have lost a loved one (like you and your family).  Everyone must work through the death psychologically in thier own way.  It sounds like your father is experiencing depression, which if is severe enough to classify as clinical depression, may require medical treatment.  Your father needs to progress to the next stage, which is acceptance.  Depending on what stage you yourself are in you may or may not be in a position to help him.  If you have a good relationship with your father, it might help to remind him that everyone dies, and though it is an unfortunate event no one escapes death.  You and your mother can remind him that you love him and care about him, and that if he neglects his health he is only hurting himself and those around him, it will not bring back his brother.  Remind him of all the people that are still alive and all the good memories you have yet to go through.  You can make plans for the future and point out good things to come such as a wedding, graduation, birthday, vacation, birth, or other event or person to be grateful for.  The more grateful he can be for the things he still has, and grateful for the time he had with his brother, the better off he will be.  It may be that there are some underlying issues like he had a fight or did something he never said sorry for and wishes he could go back and change it.  That cannot be done now, but he CAN live the rest of his life to honor his brother and the rest of his family, doing the best he can.   I am sorry for your loss and I wish your father and the rest of your family my condolences during your grieving.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Get him some marijuana, and talk about it with the greatest amount of sincerity. Holding back on account of what you are afraid the reaction will be is the worst thing you can do when representing a new way of thinking. Marijuana is GREAT for mood and for eating. It's been used as a medicine for longer than any other drug in history and for good reason. Please don't disregard what I'm saying as pushing street drugs and blow it off. Too many people are too afraid to even consider the idea for it's societal implications which aren't nearly as prevalent as they appear (unless you live in Utah or in some other religious community). <br>  <br>  PLEASE take what I say as complete sincerity, I'm trying to help.

If you feel lonely because you don't have good friends right now, that's normal too.  <br>  <br>  However, if you feel sad for no reason, if you cry for no apparent reason, if your eating, and sleeping habits have drastically changed, you should talk to your parents and get them to take you to the doctor for a check up and a depression screening.

79a94d58c74cd3ccc3a7573507097f59aa	Olá.<br>  <br>  Existe uma considerável controvérsia, n?o somente porque a ciência n?o é inteiramente conclusiva, mas também porque ela é carregada com calorosos debates sociais e políticos, particularmente na área racial. Este debate tem se chamado "natureza vs cria??o" e tem se extendido por décadas.<br>  <br>  A defini??o de inteligência também n?o é fácil. O melhor argumento sobre a inteligencia que eu conhe?o foi proposto por Dr. Eisenck, um psicólogo britanico, que definiu os "fatores" da inteligência. Atualmente é aceito que existe diferentes formas de inteligência, a qual varia entre os indivíduos.

CjxG36X5aa	Bom, já que falamos de estatísticas:<br>  - O Relatório Global de Competitividade para 2005, publicado pelo Fórum Económico Mundial, coloca Portugal em 22a posi??o, à frente de países como Espanha, Irlanda, Fran?a, Bélgica e Hong Kong. Isto representa uma subida de duas posi??es em rela??o ao ranking de  2004.<br>  - Portugal, em termos de Tecnologia ocupa a 20a posi??o no índice de tecnologia e é 15o no índice de institui??es públicas.<br>  - Pesquisas realizadas sobre qualidade de vida, levadas a cabo pelo EIU (Economist Intelligence Unit), coloca no  Quality-of-life Survey, Portugal na 19a posi??o, à frente de países económica e tecnologicamente avan?ados como Fran?a, Alemanha, Reino Unido e Coreia do Sul.<br>  Embora Portugal seja o 19o melhor país para viver no que concerne a qualidade de vida, o desemprego ainda nos afecta entre outras quest?es.<br>  - Portugal tem a maior central solar do mundo, cuja actividade iniciou em 2006.<br>  - Portugal inaugurou a primeira central de energia das marés do mundo em Outubro de 2006<br>  - Em 2006, 55% da energia produzida em Portugal era proveniente de combustíveis fósseis como o carv?o e o petróleo. Os restantes 40% provinham das centrais hidroeléctricas e os 5% vinham da energia eólica.<br>  - Os objectivos para 2010, definem que 50% da energia produzida em Portugal seja obtida a partir de fontes de energia renovável o que colocará Portugal na lideran?a do investimento neste sector a par da áustria e da Suécia.<br>  - O país, como 800 kms de costa, tem 68,732 km de estradas dos quais, 3,000 km fazem parte dos 44 sistemas de auto-estradas nacionais.<br>  - As duas principais áreas metropolitanas (Lisboa e Porto) s?o servidas por duas redes de metropolitano que, de momento, contam cada pouco mais de uns modestos 35 kms de linha.<br>  - O país, em 2008, iniciará a constru??o da linha ferroviária de alta velocidade para o TGV que ligará Porto a Lisboa e Lisboa a Madrid.<br>  - Portugal tem uma das taxas de penetra??o de telemóveis (celulares) mais elevadas do mundo chegando ao cúmulo de existirem mais telemóveis (celulares) em uso, actualmente, do que pessoas (10 milh?es e meio).<br>  - Em Outubro de 2006, 36,8% dos lares portugueses contava com acesso à internet de banda larga (ADSL) e 78% das empresas nacionais tinham acesso à internet.<br>  - Em Junho de 2004, 73.6% dos portugueses tinham televis?o por cabo.<br>  Actualmente, o acesso à internet é gratuito na maior parte dos espa?os públicos - os chamados "Espa?os de Internet".<br>  Mais estatísticas:<br>  No recenseamento de 2004, Portugal somava 10,356,117 de habitantes dos quais 51,7% mulheres, 48,2% homens e 0.1% indefinidos (...).<br>  No final de 2003, os emigrantes legais constituíam cerca de 5% da popula??o.<br>  As maiores comunidades s?o Brasil, Roménia, Ucrania, Cabo Verde, Angola, Rússia, Guiné-Bissau e Moldávia recebendo também imigrantes de outras partes da América Latina, Leste Europeu e China.<br>  84% dos portugueses dizem-se católicos embora apenas 19% sejam praticantes.

Embuste prós amigos).<br>  <br>  Concluindo, há imenso caminho para percorrer tendo em conta, como alguém disse acima, a dimens?o demográfica e geográfica do país.<br>  A meu ver, a única solu??o para fazer face a gigantes de dimens?o continental como o Brasil, China e índia passa obrigatoriamente por voltar as aten??es para a tecnologia e para a inova??o.<br>  Portugal tem dado cartas nesse sector, especificamente, a nível de Inteligência Artificial, Robótica, Biotecnologia, Engenharia de Telecomunica??es, energias renováveis, software e produ??o de electrónica relacionada com semi-condutores.<br>  No entanto, acredito que tem um potencial enorme nessas áreas que tem sabido aproveitar mas penso que ainda assim é manifestamente insuficiente. Acho que falta ambi??o de dominar mercados e instituir monopólios de produtos. Espero que a breve trecho esses le?es de negócios lusitanos deitem as garras de fora e possam demonstrar o que de melhor se produz nas áreas que referi em Portugal. é a única op??o que Portugal tem neste momento dado ter uma popula??o de 10 milh?es e meio de habitantes e um país com apenas 89 mil kms quadrados de área para fazer face ao gigantesco Brasil com os seus 180 milh?es, aos EUA com os seus 300 milh?es (30% s?o latinos emigrantes e asiáticos), à China com os seus 1300 milh?es de habitantes ou à índia com os seus 1200 milh?es.<br>  Se n?o consegue vencer pela quantidade, terá de se fazer notar pela Qualidade.<br>  Em rela??o ao Brasil, espero que os brasileiros n?o se transformem em americanos e n?o decidam come?ar a usar os ICBM's quebrando uma imagem de país pacífico que conquistaram ao longo de décadas e que invistam na qualidade de vida dos seus habitantes ao invés de usarem todo o seu potencial económico com fins bélicos e que perturbam a paz mundial.<br>  N?o se esque?am que os EUA s?o o país mais rico do mundo mas...

66g2Kwjdaa	Bom... (quantas perguntas em uma só ein... coloca separadaaaasss)<br>  <br>  Primeiramente você se refere aos jovens. Por terem sonhos mirabolantes ou n?o ter limite pra sonhar, é uma característica mais da "fase" do desenvolvimento na qual se encontram... porque afinal a adolescência e inicio da fase adulta tem sim suas características sociais, psíquicas e neurológicas. <br>  Segundo Freud, uma delas é retomar sentimentos experimentados por volta dos 6 anos e trabalhar novamente esses sentimentos, dessa vez de forma mais profunda ...raiva, ódio, amor, desejo... para lidar novamente com isso, de forma a reorganizar e reestruturar o significado de tudo isso dentro de si e para a própria vida.. vai transferir o amor que sente por si mesmo e que sentiu até ent?o pelos cuidadores, dessa vez à alguém de fora... isso gera conflitos e uma forma nova e diferente de lidar também com os sentimentos.<br>  <br>  Tem também as mudan?as neurológicas... lógico que cada sujeito é único e se desenvolve de forma distinta... mas n?o podemos descartar que o lobo frontal, que é a parte da frente do cérebro e justamente a parte que "cuida" do desenvolvimento moral, comportamento, emo??es... é a última parte do cérebro a terminar de se desenvolver... e isso ocorre por volta dos 21 anos (idade que varia de pessoa pra pessoa). Ent?o, PODE SER que tal jovem ainda se mostre pouco desenvolvido no que diz respeito à moral, limites, devido à certa influência sim dos aspectos neurológicos ainda em forma??o.<br>  <br>  Socialmente falando, tudo isso acontece na fase em que o jovem está em busca da constru??o da própria identidade... ent?o... os sonhos mirabolantes e n?o ter limites pra sonhar, é bem característico sim, de um ser humano que está se conhecendo, se identificando ao mundo e que realmente n?o conhece ainda seus limites.<br>  <br>  Com rela??o às outras quest?es... <br>  seria ótimo que cada pessoa tivesse mesmo no??o de suas qualidades e limita??es... sabe como se chama isso? AUTOCONHECIMENTO... sabe quantas pessoas buscam o autoconhecimento? poucas, bem poucas... isso se dá através de processo de interioriza??o, terapia, religi?o... de diversas formas, mas em todas elas, n?o é um processo fácil porque "se conhecer" significa entrar em contato com seus reais defeitos e também qualidades, assim como enxergar sua forma de pensar e agir... enfim... um processo as vezes doloroso, mas que ao final permite a pessoa ter clareza, ter no??o de suas qualidades e seus limites para discernir se algo está ou n?o ao seu alcance...<br>  <br>  Bom, a segunda pergunta, ...<br>  concordo que devemos correr atrás apenas dos sonhos realizáveis...<br>  E será que alguém corre atrás de sonhos n?o-realizáveis?<br>  Vou mudar a pergunta...<br>  Na vis?o "de quem" um sonho é ou n?o realizável?<br>  Uma coisa pode ser realizável pra mim e n?o ser realizável pra você... mas com toda certeza, pra quem vai tentar, aquilo é realizável! Ao menos para a pessoa em quest?o, o que ela vai tentar é realizável!!! Sen?o n?o faz nenhum sentido a pessoa ir atrás de realizar algo, se n?o acredita lá no fundo que aquilo pode se realizar...<br>  <br>  Bom, a terceira pergunta acho que podemos novamente falar no AUTOCONHECIMENTO. <br>  Quando a pessoa se conhece, SABE se sua natureza é lagartixa ou jacaré... sabe se sua natureza permite tentar ou n?o ser jacaré e consegue enxergar suas limita??es e os caminhos prováveis para chegar ao estágio de jacaré, ou ent?o para ser uma lagartixa que se aceita e tem uma vida plena e realizada... mas tudo come?a antes pelo autoconhecimento!<br>  <br>  Bom, é isso... bacanas suas perguntas, continua mandando! rs<br>  <br>  Ab?!|`|EHvvjtFWaa	cara boa pergunta  concordo com vc <br>   acho que devemos correr  atras do que e possivel  porque o impossivel e impossivel ,  mas  temos sempre que tentar  superar nossos limites ..............................<br>  <br>  1-   sim acho que sim pois   o possivel e possivel rs <br>  2-sim mais sempre  nos limites  e otimistas  rs<br>  3-claro que sim tentariar  ser o melhor do meu nivel ........rs<br>  |`|BWr6yUUjaa	concordo com vc<br>  <br>  principalmente <br>  <br>  essa parte>>CONCORDA Q DEVEMOS "CORRER ATRáS" APENAS E T?O-SOMENTE DOS SONHOS REALIZáVEIS?<<muito legal<br>  <br>  concordo genero numero e grau|`|4efJ1tBRaa	Se n?o tivéssemos sonhado alto, n?o teriamos chegado a lua! <br>  |`|jjr4cJjSaa	Ronalpi   =<br>  <br>  Como o yahoo n?o mais permite enviar esclarecimentos e recebe los, somente de sacanagem , e palavras inócua, Estou tentando me concentrar dentro das premissas das novas regras, o que me é difícil pois tal linguajar n?o faz parte do meu cotidiano.<br>  <br>  Boa Sorte   tks |`|HLFjUm2uaa	Pelo Sonho é que vamos,<br>  comovidos e mudos.<br>  Chegamos?

431zhNe6aa	*Hey, girl, cool down.  It was only a dream.  It wasn't real life.  <br>  <br>  The dream apparently indicates that you are insecure in your relationship with him and that maybe you feel threatened with his past relationship with his ex.  That can be for a lot of reasons.  Could of course be that you worry that he still loves her or has feelings for her.  Could mean that you subconsciously feel you're competing to be as good as she was to and with him.  Could mean that you just love him so much that you are so scared of losing him and this dream came about just as a reminder of that, meaning nothing else at all.<br>  <br>  Because you had that dream, that doesn't at all mean that he IS cheating on you --- unless you declare that you are a psychic. ha ha.  It's just a dream of insecurity that you subconsiously feel about your relationship with him.  It could have merit or it could be totally unfounded.  It's now up to you to think about and decide which it is. You've gotta think about is there anything that he does or says or that you feel insecure about that is making you have this kind of dream.  If it's not him that's doin' anything to make you feel that way and you realize or decide it's just you feeling that way for no reason, then hold on to your hat and come back down to earth.  Be sure not to treat him as though he IS doin' something wrong, ya know?  That will be the quickest way to make him run away from you if there's no basis for your claims.<br>  <br>  If there IS somethin' goin' on that is out in the open and apparent between them that makes you feel somethin' is no right, then talk to him about it.  If he loves you like you love him, then he will listen and be willin' to reassure you that he loves you and his "X" is just that.  If he stumbles in his words when answering you, maybe then you gotta dig deeper.  But, I don't thing that will be the case.  I think it's just a dream and nothin' else. We all have those kinds of dreams now and then.<br>  <br>  Hey, sometimes dreams just suck and should be ignored.|`|7bb7def5791e75742a5d4105132faf16aa	Yeah this is not a big deal but it just shows me few things about him like lying to you sometimes and you never know about it and some emotions going on in his mind. He hasn't yet done anything though. Once you dream of him having sex, then let me know. I'll interpret it for you. That would be your Search Warrant.|`|PxWoMHeTaa	it's probably you think he's cheating. or your jealous?|`|b30zbnqPaa	generally a dream like this means one of two things:<br>  one could be that you don't trust either him or his girlfriend yet, <br>  or second, it could mean that you have low self confidence.<br>  i wouldn't be worried about him cheating because it was just a dream, but i would be worried about being paranoid. if you get too paranoid about him cheating on you, he may just leave.|`|PIXSuzpvaa	even though you know he would never cheat on you, it seems you are still subconsciously worried about it or you are just contemplating the possibilities if something like that did happen. it sounds like a normal dream that any girlfriend with a guy who has an ex may have|`|zllN0Y6maa	it means that you got stoned the night before...|`|rwVvBMN8aa	maybe your insecure about her not him. maybe you just need to get some leftover anger out subconsciously. talk to him about it. maybe something about her has been bothering him that you subconsciously picked up.  good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  id love it if you looked at my question really quick?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoGsbvvXCOpHg1qhCx2tCGXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081021214600AAjS8lW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|c70DoGi5aa	try dream interpretation .com.  <br>  then find the page that tells you all of the meanings for every little thing in your dream. <br>  it worked for me, hopefuly youll find what your lookin for.<br>  :)<br>  |`|755b4ccc7d27a915b90e870aae916df0aa	The dream began with you in the kitchen, a place where typically people eat & socialize and which might symbolize love and satisfaction and having needs met. <br>  Then you went DOWNstairs to the basement -a lower level. <br>  There you felt emotions that were a mixture of disbelief, hurt feelings, a desire to kiss & make up, unhappiness, anger and tears of frustration. <br>  You were outraged, infuriated! So much so that you could barely breathe. You hit her ... but I wonder ... what is the action that could be seen as a slap in the face? That could symbolize a wrong done. <br>  Either he has done something to you or you've done something that, if he knew about it, would hurt your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I don't know what, if anything, has happened between you and him. Maybe you have done nothing to hurt him or that would cause you to feel ashamed. <br>  Your dream is processing some feelings or conflicts that have not been expressed.<br>  How are you feeling about your boyfriend? <br>  Wishing and hoping that you still love him, but not really sure that you do? Feeling your relationship has deteriorated or gone downhill? <br>  Are you feeling undecided or conflicted? <br>  I tend to think that the entire cast of characters in your dream represent you. Perhaps you are the one who is considering cheating on him. Perhaps there is an ex in your life who belongs to someone else now. Perhaps he has kissed you and your dream reveals your fear that one thing may lead to another until you actually do betray your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  No I don't think he has cheated on you. <br>  But for some reason, there are conflicted feelings that have surfaced in your dream.
6023571edb0bd1f28e810baa0696d30baa	Fernando,<br>  <br>  Você está pedindo que alguém diga o que significa o seu sonho. N?o quero te enganar, mas eu só posso lhe ajudar a chegar numa interpreta??o válida, profunda e significativa. Somente você é que possui a chave de abertura de suas emo??es, sentimentos e conflitos que está enfrentando atualmente. Será que fui claro? Eu lhe ajudarei no processo de encontrar algumas interpreta??es do seu sonho que, a princípio, é bem curto e objetivo. Veja que n?o há apenas um significado, mas vários, ok? O método de interpretar sonhos de forma significativa pressup?e muita sinceridade, honestidade e franqueza para com os assuntos do mundo interno. Farei abertura dos símbolos e sinais que apareceram no seu sonho. Posteriormente, farei perguntas para que você encontre a melhor interpreta??o desse sonho que revela, em primeira m?o, atra??o pelo proibido (homoerotismo e guarda de transito) e muita ousadia (chafariz).<br>  Olhe, antes de abrir os símbolos, é importante esclarecer que sou bastante contra a interpreta??o mecanica do sonho, ou seja, aquela que n?o explora o seu inconsciente, aquela que n?o n?o desafia seus sentimentos reprimidos ou recalcados. A interpreta??o mecanica dos sonhos lan?a logo significados arbitrários ou aleatórios sobre o que sonhou. Podem ser verdadeiros palpites vazios! Os yahoolegas (colegas do Yahoo) que usam a interpreta??o mecanica fazem o famoso "copiar x colar" aqui para responder sua pergunta e est?o mais interessados nos pontos. Esses n?o querem montar o quebra cabe?as do sonho e nem te ajudar na compreens?o. Usam o famoso, mas também criticado, dicionário dos sonhos!!!<br>  Você, no final da pergunta, pede ajuda para alguém lhe falar o que o seu sonho diz. Já de saída há muita informa??o importante nesse seu pedido. O fato de você pedir é fundamental para compreendê-lo. Nossos sonhos estimulam nossa inteligência e também nosso lado de investigador. Assim, n?o perca a oportunidade que seu inconsciente lhe dá para saber mais sobre si mesmo. A resposta da sua pergunta é: eu posso e lhe digo, é sinal de muita coisa e n?o somente de algo, viu?<br>  Por favor, veja as perguntas que elaborei como oportunidades de se conhecer ainda mais ou, quem sabe, de saber um pouco mais sobre as emo??es reprimidas ou recalcadas que você deve estar passando. Assim, é importante que tomae posse delas para que elas n?o te fa?am refém.<br>  Os dados que forneceu, posso suspeitar que seu sonho está na categoria de processamento de múltiplas emo??es. Processar emo??es é como se elas precisassem de ser aceitas, compreendidas e digeridas pela nossa mente para que possamos prosseguir na vida. Seu sonho indica também que há uma grande atra??o homoerótica para a figura de autoridade, ou seja, pelo guarda de transito. Há referência de que você gostaria de ser conquistado e n?o de ser o ativo no processo. Veja que há mais elementos de relacionamento do que signos e símbolos no seu sonho; Esse dado é interessante e mostra que você está envolvido na trama sexual e erótica. Por conta disso, seria interessante e importante que fracionemos seus sonho e que também você responda aos seguintes desafios:<br>  1) O que s?o esses símbolos para ti? Leia o que escrevi e, logo em seguida, escreva tudo o que vier a sua mente sobre o que leu. Esse exercício é abertura dos símbolos e também encontro com os arquétipos (os símbolos universais humanos segundo Jung) do seu sonho. Por favor, nada de pregüi?a, ok?<br>  você<br>  você sendo paquerado<br>  paquera pelo guarda de transito<br>  guarda de transito<br>  figura de autoridade<br>  pessoas que exercem a lei<br>  autoridade visível <br>  autoridade pública<br>  te pegar<br>  te jogar num chafariz<br>  chafariz<br>  água<br>  <br>  2) Esse guarda de transito é conhecido? Você, no sonho, conseguia ver a cara dele ou estava proibido? Havia outras pessoas assistindo essa paquera e prática de sexo em pra?a pública?<br>  <br>  3) Esse sonho é único ou está na categoria de repeti??o? Seus outros sonhos também apresentam sempre esse elemento homoerótico ou de exibicionismo e paquera???<br>  <br>  4) Quais s?o as suas fantasias eróticas ou pornográficas que n?o tem coragem de assumir e contar atualmente?<br>  <br>  5) Na sua história de vida, você se ligou mais ao seu pai ou a sua m?e? <br>  <br>  6) O que diz a sua intui??o sobre essa estrutura do seu sonho, isto é: alguém de autoridade te cantar e depois praticar um sexo que fica muito perto do violento?<br>  <br>  7) Por que será que você n?o teve um sonho erótico num local privado? Você tem dificuldades em fazer coisas privativas e íntimas sem a necessidade de exibicionismo?<br>  <br>  8) Quais s?o os sentimentos atuais sobre:<br>  - desejo<br>  -atra??o<br>  -homoerotismo<br>  -exibicionismo<br>  <br>  N?o sei a sua idade e nem os conflitos de ordem sexual que está passando atualmente. No entanto, seria interessante e importante que tentasse ajuda especializada nesse momento. Isso é sério, pois há inúmeros sentimentos que você precisa urgentemente esclarecer, aclarar e integrar na sua personalidade. Eu me lembrei do filme maravilhoso "Quarto Homem" e também do "C.r.a.z.y.", uma vez que seu sonho está muito próximo do intrigante e misterioso (você já viu esses filmes?) mundo da sexualidade.  Veja aí dentro de si, se vc n?o está se reprimindo demais e querendo fazer algo que vire notícia ou escandalo, ok? Talvez, lá no fundo, você sinta necessidade de provar para os outros que te recriminam pela orienta??o homoerótica que você n?o está nem aí para o que pensarem ou verem. No entanto, e saindo do plano teórico, se você concretizar esse sonho, poderá escandalizar mesmo, mas terá que arcar com os custos legais de um sexo público, uma vez que na cultura brasileira, sexo é algo para ser realizado privadamente, Também me chamou a aten??o sua objetividade em descrever seu sonho... ele foi rápido e curto assim mesmo?<br>  <br>  Pense com carinho em tudo que escrevi e palpitei aqui.<br>  <br>  Finalmente, gostaria muito de ter sua opini?o no meu e-mail, independente de ter sido escolhido aqui como a melhor resposta, ok?|`|hJEG00XNaa	é simples quer dizer que vc esta virando gay e so precisa de um impurraozinho para vc assumir^^|`|tknQc9vHaa	Que na próxima parada gay você vai criar coragem, se cobrir de purpurina, e soltar a franga.<br>  Ui, poderosa.<br>  <br>  Desculpe colega, n?o resisti.<br>  Sinceramente, n?o sou psicologa junguiana, nem m?e de santo para lhe dar conselhos.<br>  |`|4efJ1tBRaa	Nossa amigo que pergunta difícil n?o?

3N2ElzcQaa	I think your dream means that you're really really really in love with Keith. (Well duh, you just said that you're dating) You want to hit it big with him, like the wedding in your dream.<br>  <br>  But you're also liking Mike. In your dream, he came in, said something to you, and whisked you away.|`|XZ1SmeyAaa	To see a wedding in your dream, symbolizes a new beginning or transition in your current life.  Dreams involving weddings are often negative and highlight some anxiety or fear. It often refers to feelings of bitterness, sorrow, or death.  Alternatively, wedding dreams reflect your issues about commitment and independence. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are getting married to your current spouse again, represents your wedded bliss and happiness. It highlights your strong commitment to each other. It may also signify a new phase (such as parenthood) that you are entering in your life. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are planning your own wedding to someone you never met, is a metaphor symbolizing the union of your masculine and feminine side. It represents a transitional phase where you are seeking some sort of balance between your aggressive side and emotional side.<br>  <br>  If you are getting married and have dreams of your pending wedding, then it highlights the stress of organizing a wedding.  Conflicts over wedding details, tension with family and in-laws, fear of commitment, and loss of independence may all cause wedding anxiety dreams.  Research has shown that up to 40% of brides and grooms have dreams about their ceremony and things going perfectly. |`|a2d5f09faa119f6c2350ba3f50dd69efaa	DREAMS HAVE HIDDEN MEANINGS. you can't tell what it is just through the story . people, actions and all all symbolize different things. also......you seem quite worried so maybe you like your friend? |`|6yhNYoXdaa	someones gonna die<br>  wedding in dreams mean deaths|`|431zhNe6aa	*Weddings don't mean death!  Having said that, it is SO, SO obvious that you have feelings for "Mike" still.  You think of getting married to "Keith" and having a life with him but you keep wishing that Mike would step up and swoop you away from Keith because that is what you really want to happen.  You are with Keith because that's the way it is -- BUT you want to be with Mike.  And, you want him to be your knight in shining armor and come to you and romantically win your heart again.<br>  <br>  Babe, you're still in love with "Mike" and your heart is crying out for him.

If you dwell too much on the past it makes you worse, accept whatver happened and move on life. |`|ACSR4Vbyaa	Is this a serious question?<br>  <br>  First of all, evil is entirely subjective so for as many people answer this question, you'll probably get that many opinions.<br>  <br>  Secondly, we don't know what you've done so we can't judge whether or not you are "evil" by any standards.<br>  <br>  Also, if we don't know what you've done, how can we answer the second question seriously?<br>  <br>  At any rate, it seems to me that anyone can become virtuous if he or she has a strong desire to do so.

Testify far and wide to the reasoning behind your change.  <br>  <br>  The worst thing you can be is ignorant of the needless pain you've caused, like President Bush's callous attitude towards the million Iraqi civilians who've been killed in the 'liberation' effort.  <br>  <br>  It's people like that whose graves are pissed on.   |`|WCo25oFmaa	Sure!  start with little things, like smiling at strangers, holding doors for the elderly, then move on to bigger tasks.

That takes time and effort, so don't expect to be Gandhi tomorrow.<br>  <br>  I know a man who did just that.  After a few years of effort, his own virtuosity started giving some people inferiority complexes.  It was funny to watch as they were judging themselves badly without ever a harsh word uttered by my friend.|`|NWwAo95Zaa	I always felt low on self-esteem throughout my high school life. Because of that, I've been perceived as a very shy person. That didn't stop potential friends from coming up to me and being there for me. It's possible for anyone and everyone to become virtuous, you just have to be willing to realize your mistakes and try to learn and repair your life from there. You can't be evil if you have a conscience.|`|GAjQHpg8aa	Of course. The way is to share everything and give little acts of kindness to everyone. If you continue this way you will never think dark thoughts or hate again. The past CAN be wiped out.

When he did not pay attention to her or gave another girl a ride home, she cried. <br>  Homecoming = boyfriend time, am I correct?<br>  From w hat I'm seeing you're like my sister to me. I know not completely but ugh. If your boyfriend is making you feel like **** and worthless and is only making your self esteem go down, please break it off with him before he breaks it off with you.<br>  On your side, it'd be easier to get over him if he is that bad. Why would you want a boyfriend that only makes you feel like a worthless piece of ****? I know it'll be hard because I saw it with my own eyes...But I know you can make it.<br>  Everyone is different but my sisters self esteem after her boyfriend increased dramatically and she gained so many more lessons about her self and about relationships with men.<br>  I believe that you can become a stronger person from this. I don't think you are depressed but your boyfriend is the one who is causing all these problems. <br>  Please take care of yourself and if he seriously is plotting to get rid of you, be the stronger person and get rid of him. He won't expect it and you'll be the one causing HIM pain--what he wanted to cause you. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your future mental stability. :) I wish you could keep me updated! But be strong!

Many people get angry at such matters, but only a small percentage act upon their feelings.<br>  <br>  About controlling them...best to realize that just because you dream of these things, doesn't mean it'll happen to you.  In fact, you never are actually involved in the acts themselves.  And, you're scared afterward.<br>  <br>  Try to remember...although you dream these things, you keep your distance.  And your fear.  It might make you feel better to get into the dream and help the victims, but I don;t know if you can dream lucidly,  But, you can always fantasize afterward, about what you'd like to do, if you saw someone raped or killed.  It might help you define your attitudes clearly.  If nothing seems to help, maybe you should see a counselor.

With teachers pushing you to your last straw, parents expecting me to keep constant good grades in all of my honors classes, and just the people around me expecting so much.  It's a lot to have on my plate.  My teachers just assign, assign, assign.  It's non-stop homework, projects, and class work.  Then with my parents, they expect so much out of little old me!  I mean, for example, if I get a low B on a test they flip out!  It's hard to take in sometimes.  Along with the getting up at 6 a.m. thing, trying to look your best so you're not judged (not that I care, giving reference for other teens my age).  It seems like society is just, well, leaning on us.  Teens are the future after all.  I miss the good old days, when I came home and the homework I had was like a little worksheet that I could finish in two minutes.  Or when, politics didn't even seem like a topic to me, it was just one of those "grown-up things".  When the Iraq war started, it was like another story my parents told me.  Now, politics are big in my school, I know about nearly everything that happens around the world, and I have tons of homework =(.

ephBKMthaa	Tell him the truth, and hold true to yourself.   Mushrooms mess with your head and if he was still high when he texted you and called you afterward - you did a good thing telling him it was "ok".   <br>  <br>  So don't be so confused, you know in your heart that you need to move on, so do it and be good to yourself, you deserve it.  You are not responsible for his happiness, only your own.  It's not just the fact that he is doing "shrooms" that should concern you, because high or not he should respect you and not play games with your head.  Sending a text message to break up is lame and lets be honest cowardly to boot.<br>  <br>  Remember, we can love people and not like who they are or what they do. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Hu4PI0q2aa	well you ned to get him in a happy mooed when he is not taking the shroomes and take to him and tell him that you love him but you do not think that this is going to work out with you and him and tell him that it's not him it's you and that you just need Space to get things together and then you will see about getting back together or not. but would all so have same one there for back up just in case things go bad and so yo do not get hurt.|`|u33x2hqzaa	Sadly it's not going to work out.  If he's in a place of experimenting with drugs and you don't accept that behavior or like what it's doing to his personality, you can't change that and staying in this kind of relationship will only make you miserable.  It's so hard to break up with someone but at some point you are only delaying a painful decision.  You gotta be free to find someone who shares your interests & values.  There's no easy way to break up with someone but if you don't want to be with them that's exactly what you gotta do.  Good luck!
bR4BgFLlaa	Sure. I think its terrible for both sexes that men are expected by society to have less of a role in the lives of their children. Fathering is every bit as important as mothering. It is naive and damaging to think that all mothers are maternal, lots of dads are just as nurturing as the best moms.<br>  <br>  By the way, I am a feminist. Once again, feminism is about equality not about getting one over on men!|`|V1MptCMiaa	We all know feminists aren't interested in getting men any rights (even though they say they're all for "equal" rights).

I don't think that NOW has a specific obligation to though.  Each organization and advocacy group has the right to specialize and focus on its own causes at its will.  In fact, that's kind of how things get done.  It makes no sense for every advocacy group to try and man a campaign for every civil rights effort, no matter how decent the cause.  The group's goals would be too unfocused and they simply wouldn't have the resources.  If this is something you're passionate about, maybe you should consider donating/volunteering with the American Coalition of Fathers and Children or another group that deals specifically with father's rights.|`|DBg0yFSYaa	I'm a woman and my mother withheld visitation from me. Nothing was ever done. This is not a gender issue. It's custodial vs. non-custodial issue. As far as the same sex partner thing, this is a result of only one of the partners actually being a biological parent to the children in question. Also sort of a different issue. A women's rights organization should focus on women's rights. This would be an issue for children's rights, not one parent or the other.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	NOW is the American femenist organisation and it is for femenist women as the name makes clear.<br>  <br>  It must not try to become involved with fathers or with men generally.

Mothers, for the most part, are never punished in any way for violating these orders.|`|emOhSyY5aa	They should. But they hate men, so that will happen when pigs fly.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Custody issues are extremely important. It is well known that children's welfare is best served by both parents, unless there is unresolvable conflict or drug/alcohol abuse which threatens actual harm to the children.<br>  <br>  Whether the NOW is the organisation of first resort to address these issues is a different matter. There are numerous organisations already offering support, financial and otherwise, to non-custodial parents seeking to improve their access and other custodial arrangements. For the most part, when the parent in question is the father these are the "men's rights" groups and they vary in their degrees of religiosity and polemicism. <br>  <br>  To insist that NOW, for the sake of semantics, fight specifically for fathers' rights, is to open a large area of potential demand that all organisations, including the men's rights ones, fight for everyone's rights.|`|nAF7ppxwaa	I think so!
jbvBBoFRaa	Well populations in the past were definately much smaller in stature, most people did not even come close to 6ft in height.  Yes, you would have a better immune system and health than most people, due to your very wide array diet.

So yes, it would be a weird culture.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	depends what time period you went back to. Heights decreased in medieval times due to overcrowding and poor diet--doors were also small to help preserve heat. If you went back  to viking times or even the British bronze or Iron age the average person would be about the same height as today and you would even find 6footers.
QjifsTNfaa	I think that you're subconsciously feeling trapped and claustrophobic with your father. You're the type of person who enjoys your freedom and the subtitles of routine. You enjoy doing your rituals everyday by yourself because ritual in a way is comforting. However, your routine has been thrown off and essentially you're whole mind is off right now. It needs time to adjust to certain things. Because this is the first time you've been forced to change your routine. Therefore, you don't necessarily know how to work around things. <br>  <br>  Don't feel lost or sad. Just recreate your routine and rituals with your father in mind. Recreate your patterns to fit him into the equation. Everything is fine. I promise. It's just that you were mentally thrown off. We all get that sometimes. :]|`|Hu4PI0q2aa	you are ok trust me. you are like me i like when i am alone in the house so i can be by my self but what is different about us is that i also like to have my husband here with me. but you are a little different then me because you like to be by you self all the time and that can be good for you and it can be bad for you see a doctor if you need more help.|`|VSQYLWt6aa	Well, there's obviously something about your dad that makes you depressed whenever he's around.<br>  Is there some kind of problem between you and your father?|`|4uOWeRbtaa	wow that explains my problem to|`|u33x2hqzaa	I'm an introvert myself but that doesn't mean I don't need to get out of the house & meet new people to spur my thinking.

Your mind is telling you it needs new thoughts, new habits and new experiences to be a happy camper.  Think about ways you can get out & do new things.  Good luck.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Maybe you are a natural loner, someone who prefers their own company?  Maybe your father is a depressing demanding person and that is what makes you feel despondent when he is around?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if he stays at your home or you still reside at home with him? If he is staying at your home, then you will be able to have your freedom back when he is well enough to return to his own home.

PfE6bg5iaa	it's both.<br>  <br>  I'm a senior in the second best mechanical engineering program in the country. In the College of Engineering, we are very high at 20% female. I have also worked in the auto industry as a paid intern. <br>  <br>  As far as discrimination, I've experienced it both in school and in work. My program involves extensive teamwork assignments. Chances are, I will be assigned to a team of all males. Very often, I have to struggle to have my voice heard. My opinions and ideas are often discounted. And not rightly so -- it took a couple tries to get my team to listen to me but I developed the design which we are using for a federal grant proposal.<br>  <br>  In the workplace, a much younger, less experienced, and lazy male intern got more attention from management than I did even though I completed a project which could save them $40,000 on each purchased machine. This intern often slept on the job and did not complete any of his assignments over that summer. It's called the "frat boy mentality." I had to work hard to have my coworkers see me as an equal and develop that trust that I would not report them for calling me "toots" or "babe."<br>  <br>  As for the biological factors, I think generally young girls color, play dress up and young boys play with tonka trucks, hotwheels. With this generalization, it's obvious which gender would gravitate towards english, art, etc and which would end up in engineering. <br>  <br>  In comment towards the pay gap, most numbers used do not take into account the different careers. However, it has been acknowledged by various male and female professors and advisors that an entry level female engineer will make less than an entry level male. It comes with the territory -- but no matter how unfair, I will stick with it because it's what I love.<br>  <br>  keypoint: The average score at most respectable universities in the US are associated with a B, B-, or C+. Exams must be curved because most professors are more interested in their research and grant money than writing a reasonable, fair exam. Various professors at my university think that school is harder for students now.<br>  <br>  Steffi: Why does being an engineer make a woman a lesbian? Hm, must have missed the memo on that one, I better cancel my engagement with my fiance. <br>  <br>  beachbum: In courses of studies such as math, physics, and medicine the gap has closed signifantly. Engineering occupations, however, are still very predominantly male... as stated from the original question: 10%.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	A bit of both. I think it is because women arn't taking advantage of all the career oportunites open to then. Some some still pursure traditional careers such as teaching, nursing, secretary etc. Not that there is anything wrong with these careers. They are actually quite important jobs, in terms of contributing something to society. However non-traditional jobs for women such as engineers, pilots, they just don't seem to be as interested in these areas as careers.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps this is because of biological differences, some women just arn't interested in pursuring certain career paths. However some non-traditional career paths such as the police force women can face discrimation so perhaps that deters them as well.|`|MyX42szoaa	Clearly the biological differences. It amuses me how all these feminists complain about things like "wage gap" and "discrimination" when all the evidence suggest that the reason why men as a group are more successful and make more money than women is because men are more likely to seek out those rewarding occupations. Women are just as capable to become an engineer or computer programmer but they don't, so logic dictates that they as a group are going to make less money than men.<br>  <br>  Of course feminists don't like to see it that way. They distort and twist the facts to fuel their propaganda.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Both. When my mom was in (chemical) engineering school she faced a lot of discrimination. She was shown slides of women in skimpy clothing holding rulers and the teacher commented, "in case you were wondering what women engineers are good for."<br>  <br>  But *all* gaps have been closing regarding education. Now math degrees are even about 50-50<br>  <br>  There have been large increases since the 70s adn with less discrimination and more awareness of sexual harassment it will continue to grow.|`|WxYCI40oaa	I think that gender disparities take their bases in the night of times due to biological differences: the men were those who hunted down big beasts to feed the whole clan; so biggest the streght, biggest the risk, and biggest is the autority and decisionally power.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	engineer? come on, a woman has to get perfect grades to even be considered  able to get into an engineering program at university|`|XTnnZczLaa	No longer.  Females were prevented from studying in all areas of engineering, strongly discouraged from pursuing a medical degree, building sciences, aeronautical research, agriculture, veterinary medicine, astronomy.If the female came from a very rich or politically family who contributed a large financial endowment to the school she would be reluctantly admitted to a male defined course of study,  It was the persistent and victorious challenge of these policies by the ACLU in state courts, and federal courts that were responsible for the change of the admission policies.  So, the gender gap in the formerly male dominated professions has narrowed significantly and will continue to do so.  Innate biological gender differences are strongly biological which contribute to sex characteristics.

(might being the key word) if the person is seriously ill, and will not be able to get better, and is in constant pain, then maybe they could get help from a doctor, such as euthanasia, so that they didn't kill themselves painfully.<br>  <br>  what i really don't agree with people, who just think that their life sucks, who are willing to drag their friends out to watch their own death. i hate that.|`|EPiq31ktaa	if your dog or cat had cancer, would you use euthanasia as a viable option to end their life?

2KUdefSBaa	Great question.  Sorry, you won't like my answer. Please don't be offended that I don't share your views.<br>  <br>  Western society feminisn is not about equality or fairness. Western society feminism is misandry. It started out right but has ended wrong. They don't want what you call feminism because it is unethical and dysfunctional as it leads to a polarized, fragemented, unproductive society, destroys families, isolates men and women into silos, etc.  They just want equality and happiness, not absolute power regardless of the cost, that is what we should all strive for. <br>  <br>  Confrontations are unproductive and should be avoided by any respectful people in a loving relationship. The focus should be on getting along, not the western focus which is the opposite.  Its good that they reject western society's misandry obsession characterized by being in a permanent state of gender warfare with a take no survivors attitude. <br>  <br>  Its great that Morrocans can think for themselves objectively and seek to gain equal rights without demonizing males and focusing on maintaing a happy and stable family oriented culture.|`|AA11937917	women in Muslim nations are interpreting for themselves, and defining their movement in terms they find appropriate.

uQn32vxwaa	Maybe talk to your friend and ask her if she wants to hang out or just talk for a while.  It's hard not having just one good friend. We all need that.  Having a bunch of friends but no one to really confide in can be very lonely.  Let your friend know how you're feeling. If she's a real friend, she'll make time for you. Also, what about a sister or your mom? Could you open up to eithe of them? Even having a mom to talk to can help.  Many people are in the same boat as you. Don't give up.

AA10435220	The economically correct ways to fix this problem are simple.  Austrian economists still recognize economics as a science, not a political football.  <br>  <br>  <br>  To simplify the concept: When you have problems like our current situation that are caused by (A) government intervention, (B) poor investment choices, and (C) bad decisions on the part of individuals; politicians attempt to intervene in A, B, and C, for political gain.  They increase A, tax the people who could fix B, and support C's bad decisions.  This is where the disagreement comes from.  Politicians use social engineering tactics that end up distorting the markets and just make A, B, and C worse without addressing the fact that A, B, and C caused the problem in the first place.  <br>  <br>  Austrian economists view economics as a science and insist that any action taken by the government will just make the situation worse.  They recognize that government intervention will always result in a less-than-optimal economic result because the government is incapable of creating anything without first confiscating private capital and diverting it to political allies.  This results in opportunity costs that are not included in GDP calculations.  Humans follow incentives.  While individual economic behavior may be hard to predict on a day to day basis, overall economic activity can be predicted through the logical examination of any given policy's effect on the incentive structure of all participants.  ALL Participants being the operative phrase.  Which is what makes it impossible for government intervention to be any more than a political tool without any real economic value.<br>  <br>  Austrian economists also recognize the fact that the economy is too large to centrally plan.  No one (especially politicians) has the ability to address every possible outcome related to a regulation, tax, or spending bill.  Beyond that, once a government gets around to acting, the economic conditions have changed from what the initial intent of the intervention was based on.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the media tends to lump everyone with an economics background into the same category.  Most politically associated, "top expert" economists are just Keynesian hacks or social engineers looking to get on the government's payroll.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Very few economist disagree (Austrian economist do, but they are a small minority) with the idea we should bailout the financial institutions however there are differing opinions about how we should do it. There is more disagreement about the stimulus plan and how effective it will be, but some sort of stimulus  by the government is usually passed when we are in recession and many people who oppose one now supported Bush's stimulus in 2001, that is they are expressing the political position not their knowledge of economics.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	I don't think anybody can get their head around this. I heard by the end of the year, 100 banks (companies, not branches) will be closed in the USA, time to keep what ever cash you guys got left under your pillows.<br>  I suppose Bush spending over 3trillion dollars in a war without end wasn't a good call now.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	People are not machines.  And that's why human behavior is not easily predictable, which includes economic behavior of people too.<br>  <br>  A lot of economists were saying early last year that there won't be a recession, only a mild slowdown, and then a pick-up in the economy in the second half of 2008.  Their consensus turned out to be extremely false.  And now many economists have lost confidence in their predictive abilities.  And that's why they don't have as much consensus between themselves as they've had before.<br>  <br>  The danger of all these government bailouts and vastly increased government spending is that the government might end up deeply in debt just like the people are.  And then who will bailout both the government and the people?  <br>  <br>  It's a high risk strategy that might end in a bad way for the country.  And that's why not everyone agrees with these bailouts.|`|d36OrpbDaa	because economists are not psychic.<br>  <br>  no one can predict the future.  they can just make educated guesses based on important macroeconomic indicators and historical trends.<br>  <br>  i guarantee you that legitimate economists are not making stabs in the dark.  but they can't always be spot on, either.  same goes for politicians, priests, teachers, presidents, parents...|`|0mWNeZw5aa	Economics is a social science, not a kosher "hard" science absent of human affairs-- so like anything involving people, there are headbutts and disagreements... <br>  <br>  Economists realize results are not flawless: there's good and bad in every economic decision. So the basic mold of economics is a philosophy called utilitarianism, favoring what produces more good than bad, realizing you get a mix of the two flavors in whatever decision is made.<br>  <br>  The disagreement between economists is wherein that tedious balance between the beneficial and harmful effects of an economic decision resides. And to hone in a bit more, you're right to point out that it all gets a bit fuzzy because all this involves presuppositions on psychology, values, group dynamics, etc. The efficiency of market forces is one assumption taken for granted in modern economic thought, for example; in an unrelated tidbit Stephen fry pokes fun at this in a sketch here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMqfx5Ers4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMqfx5Er...</a><br>  <br>  Most modern economists are either Keynesians or Supply-Siders so far as government policy goes. Keynesians believe the government should take an active role in sustaining market health by infusing the economy with government funds during market downturns; Keynesians want regulation and focused spending to correct market inefficiency. (Democrats are mostly Keynesian, as is Obama's stimulus plan.) Supply-Siders are enlightened "do-nothings" in a sense. They like incentives in the form of tax cuts and transparency via loose regulation, believing the market to be self-sufficient and only warped when government tangles its seamless cords. (Most Republicans are Supply-Siders).<br>  <br>  Personally, I think economics is a load of polished bullshit -- and that most its suppositions are psychological in nature. But anyhow, Keynesians seem right minded and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Hope this was helpful and that you managed through all the jargon with a good laugh from the video's link!<br>  <br>  :-D

I know its him I can feel it...would I tell him...no.<br>  <br>  Thats my opinion,. maybe im psychic for like 17 years later or something but why would it remind me so quickly. We went out and I could talk to him like I already knew him for HOURS. And yes Im attracted to him greatly.

l0F7lSaraa	~ No. There are too many people in the world who are in control to let that happen. I don't know how many people realize this- but almost everything that happens around you happens because of a contract and decisions made behind closed doors, and this includes the pace of technology even down to it's actual release date. It can also be stopped in a notice if it is agreed upon by the powers to be. There is new technology being planned and tested behind closed doors that the public is not even aware of yet. It all happens at a very slow and deliberate pace. But it SEEMS (appears) explosive to the public because of course there is a release DATE not dates- which means in public perception it appears to happen all at once.<br>  <br>  Of course things do get out of control (ie spam) - there is always a dark side to everything- but I don't think the dark side could become powerful enough to take over.<br>  <br>  But I know I don't think things are happening too fast- I think the people who release the technology know what they are doing in releasing it to the public.<br>  <br>  <br>   ~ In my opinion, technology, like any tool, can be dangerous when used improperly (the state of the planet as evidence; pollution etc.).. so I think speed bumps in the road of technology, hypothetically, could be a good thing. That being said, we are at a point when technology may be our only salvation, from the ravages of past and present misuses of technology, and speed being of utmost importance. The alternative is the elimination of technologies for a very long time, while the planet heals itself; that's not an option, unless the planet makes that choice for us...:)|`|hy3IydcWaa	I would like it if tech advanced faster but yet not every1 would have access and the money to buy the coolest things.<br>  Yet it would be better if tech slowed down so that every1 can catch up and solve some issues we have with tech already like text bullying,E-waste,Fraud..etc.<br>  <br>  We just need to take things one step at time I surpose.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	Well, since you've posted this on an Internet forum, you may not get much agreement.

My little $20 music player is NOT an ipod, works well with Windows Media Player, and is far more flexible. I would agree that people all to often fall victim to the sexiest media hype and buy things like ipods, bose sound systems, sony tvs etc. while there are often cheaper and better alternatives to all of the above.

vAdtlZDpaa	This is a dream about feeling emotionally threatened and trying to protect yourself. <br>  <br>  The kitchen is a symbol of nurturing, which in your dream is invaded. To dream that something happens at night means that you do not have a clear vision of the situation. You saw a shadow, which signifies some aspect of yourself or your personality that you have not yet recognized, or some part of yourself that you want to keep hidden from view. It may not be negative trait - it could be some creative aspect. A door in a dream is an symbol of an outlet to a new opportunity, personality trait, or attitude. In your dream you didn't want to face this aspect of your personality or allow it to enter your consciousness, so you blocked the door. The fridge is a symbol for cold (blocked or unexpressed ) emotions.<br>  <br>  Next the thief has entered the house and is threatening you with a knife. This could represent you feeling "robbed" in some way, or feeling as though others are trying to steal your energy or ideas.  The knife may be symbolic of something divisive in your life. You may feel as though people are "making demands" of you in your waking life. <br>  <br>  Finally, you choke the thief and step on his neck.  To dream that you are choking someone signifies feelings of aggression. You may also be trying to prevent something from being said or revealed. The neck signifies the relationship between the mind/mental and the body/physical. It represents willpower, self-restriction and your need to control your feelings and keep them in check.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	if you had similar experience before, its a reflex.<br>  <br>  if you didn't, then it's probably a memory reflesh from your past experience of a similar topic action movie or something.|`|s7da43bTaa	You should value what's important to you and keep it form attack. Assosciate your dream from material items to people and life. Say your best friend or someone you loved were in trouble then you must put them first and risk everything for them. I think this is what it's trying to tell you
3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	Wow, that's so strange...<br>  Perhaps the old lady represented something you were dealing/struggling with at the time, and being able to break free and run away meant that it was the end to your struggles, hence, putting an end to having the dreams.<br>  The part about your 'soul' or shadow stumps me. Although, it could have just been what your sub-conscience came up with as a narrator of sorts. Maybe the pile of logs was the object in your life that triggered the main struggle; seeing as how you always noticed the pile of logs before the old lady attacked.<br>  I hope I helped. Good luck, and God bless.<br>  <br>  PS. My Aunt is really good with dream interpretation. I'm going to mention this to her!|`|tiW8tSPuaa	Ok, It could mean that later in youre life when you have a kid there may be a adult women figure in his/her life older, who may try to do him harm. cool dream too. I whish i had dreams like that more offten|`|TLaj6aHBaa	Now to answer this question, i think i'd need some more information about what was going on in your life. But from what you've given me, I think that you were going through some major issue that was hard for you to understand (ie a divorce, a change in social or economic status for the worse, etc.) and your mind put it into terms that you could understand. In Snow White, You knew that the Queen/ Witch caused all the problems. So When you tried to escape this problem in your dream, the Queen kept bringing you back to the reality. When you escaped (solved) your problem, you escaped the Queen, who was the dream version of your problem.<br>  <br>  PS Ya I know its long and a bit confusing but hey, its my first 'answer'
30BC5dBVaa	Well, it could be the result of an overactive imagination, or maybe if your friend has watched a lot of ghost/demon movies lately, these could be influencing her dreams.<br>  <br>  It's common to find your body in weird positions while sleeping, and she might have been hugging herself in her dream, especially if she was scared, which would lead to waking up in a corpse pose.<br>  <br>  Usually when you have dreams about spirits or demons it's a sign to pay attention to what is going on in your life. If she was still living in that house it could be a signal that the house is haunted & that the ghosts are trying to communicate with her while she sleeps. Spirits on a general level are symbolic of secrets or things we are trying to hide. Whomever the spirit shoved against the wall, if it was someone she didn't know in real life than it was a representation of herself & she was shoving her own self against the wall - which would mean that her dream is trying to tell her that an under-examined (ghost-like) aspect of herself is holding her back from doing things, or, something within her ownself (perhaps her thoughts or actions as of late) are frightening her.<br>  <br>  The little girl is especially symbolic of her mind making her dream these things to play out her own internal fears & questions. The little girl is her, even though it is a demon child. B/C it is a demon child, like the bad spirit, it seems like your friend is afraid of something about herself. It may be a repressed fear from childhood trying to manifest itself as well - a lot of our fear based dreams are just repressed fears from the day, or from years, just playing out in our sleep. Like our unconscious unwinding. It's how babies  & adults are able to integrate & learn from their world - through intense dream state sleep.
AA10988719	Your concern is very touching.  I would be interested to know what your relationship is to the woman (girlfriend or wanna be boyfriend) and the only reason I ask is because your approach to her would be different depending on your role.  I included two links you can look them over and refer them to her, or you can take the info to heart and help integrate it to her situation.  :)  I wish you the best of luck.  Here is a brief tidbit about the links I am referring you to.  <br>  <br>  FIRST one: Review of past mistakes, reclaim your self-control, gather physical strength, and make a plan. These ideas were taken from the first link below - but they make a lot of sense if you think about it.  Admit acknowledge the mistakes (don't assign or accept blame for them)  -- put yourself (or HER) back in the drivers seat (let her make decisions for herself based on her needs/wants) -- become physically fit in mind, body, and soul -- meaning eat good, exercise, drink water, pamper herself etc.... and finally make a plan on what she wants her OUTCOMES to be, and what SHE NEEDS to do to make the outcomes a reality.  Be there for her and support her, but do not make the decisions for her - give her both pros and cons if she asks your opinion.  She needs to be in charge of her life.  <br>  <br>  The second link is a governmental publication (an ebook) from Health/Human Svc. Mental Health Dept. it has a ton of information.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I seriously hate it when beautiful or attractive people have low self-esteem. That really irritates me.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the person that you are talking about sounds like she will have to work this one out on her own. You can probably speed this up if you compliment her often, but not too much, and show her how much you care about her like by taking her out to eat or asking her if she would like to do something else fun with her.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	You can't. Ignore her and see how she does on her own.|`|pPxEhKnaaa	Kill them with compliments!|`|pjomniPGaa	Make her see her good side.

Let her know and overcome it with her self.|`|oTKsDru6aa	By loving and caring for them and you could share your ideas about their low self-esteem.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	"Helping" her is hurting her. Your enemies tell you most about yourself. Helping means reinforcing the idea that she is bad. You shouldn't (in my opinion) go from "bad" to "good", but from "bad" to "where am I?" <br>  <br>  Assuming that you are headed somewhere is the first step in the wrong direction. It's a problem to solution society, and I think it should be more of a problem to why do I assume this is a problem kind of society.|`|7p2IknBOaa	You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.

AND BECAUSE THE PERSON GRABS YOUR PHONE COULD BE A INDICTATION THE YOU WISH YOU HAD SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THE SITUATION OR THAT SOMEONE YOU MIGHT THINK KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THEY ARE WAITING ON YOU TO APPROACH THEM SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WITH IS WHY YOU JUMPED ON THERE BACK.  YOU WAKE UP IN A COLD SWEAT HEARING A GUNSHOT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR DEAD BUT IT COULD MEAN AFTER YOU TALK ABOUT THIS SITUATION WITH A PERSON THE SITUATION IS DEAD AND HAS CLOSURE.|`|k3kAzLHgaa	I've had a dream like that b4 only it was slightly different ..I was fighting off a vampire who I just found out killed my nana ..and I picked up a knife and stubbed him with a silver stake knife (why coudln't it have been a warewolf lol ) and then he grabed the knife form my hand and sliced my arm ..then the other ..and I felt it so badly it killed ..then I stabed him and so yah ..but when I woke up I was hold my arms and crying ..and for a while I still felt the pain . It was very strange . So now I dont' believe that dreams can't hurt you ..but as far as why this has happened to you and I ..I have no clue .
00tDK5gYaa	Well, I'm not the guy from the bible who could interpret dreams, like the pharoah's about the cows, but about the other guy's answer, yes you can interpret dreams. Now what I would think is, are you sad about this break up, cause in the end you said something about tears. Maybe it's telling you that you need to stop worrying or stop being sad about this break up, he wasn't for you. thats what im saying. i may not be right, but i hope i helped :)|`|r3xuKqakaa	the transformation into a bird could be a changing in his feelings . <br>  the colors that were changing could be the feelings he had for you .<br>  flying away means leaving something behind . a shape of a tear drop means that you feel sadness ..|`|r6ok7NbEaa	Dreams don't mean anything! People have to learn to be better informed about the workings of our minds. Dreams are just the brain's way of staying busy while you sleep. Worry about what's going on in your waking life. Focus on the things you CAN interpret, and things will begin to make more sense. Just try to be honest with yourself as much as possible. If you regret not being with your boyfriend anymore, even deep down, then talk it out with someone and don't hold anything back. People B.S. themselves so much in order to try to change how they feel. Just be honest with yourself.
aG0Kfd22aa	EAt a gorrila and maybe that will cure the macaroni problem|`|3caebbcb1c3879717aa94532d95d504daa	Its simply the dream of your own desires in real life.  You have been thinking and daydreaming about kissing her for that first time so much in real life that you are  dreaming about it.. Happens to nearly everyone, you are quite normal.
jmlAmr3gaa	You can't force thoughts out of your head, but you can replace negative thoughts with positive ones, teaching yourself enough love and acceptance of life and your situation so that you can move on.<br>  <br>  Basically, every time you do something, it's because you LIKE it.  Really.  I know you claim to be sad, and I've no doubt that you are, overall, but on a simpler, more moment-to-moment level, you're choosing to be sad, by focusing on negative things, because that's the choice you like right now.  Every time you think a negative thing, look for a positive thing to replace it with.  "I can't believe it's 6am and I have to get up."  "I'll get see the sunrise."  "This soup is horrible." "Hahha, this is the funniest stuff I've ever eaten."  Anything can be positive, if you try, just like you've managed to take everything in your life and make it negative.<br>  <br>  You've been on a downward spiral, focusing on negativity.  Now turn around, and start an upward spiral, focusing on the good things.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Im sorry your feeling so bad.<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=depression&ei=UTF-8&fr=hp-pvdt">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=depress...</a>|`|c2faaed487e37842ff3532bde2bc56a7aa	You need some affection, some love or even heartbreak...lol <br>  <br>  <br>  or watch a sad movie like  titanic ;)|`|1iXvphNYaa	Just because you don't cry doesn't mean you're not saddened, just because you don't moan and groan and mourning to the point you neglect your own needs doesn't mean you never loved and appreciated someone who is no longer with you. Normal is another label they paint on us. There is a time for everything and theres no need to push. Don't stress yourself out because of this. That's forgetting how to feel because you won't let yourself. You are welcome to all the joy and sadness in this world as much as the next person and theres no need for you to stand in the way of life and however it comes at you. Peace. :)|`|lzp70MlZaa	Wow, maybe you should get out and not be on yahoo for too long, being alone or being alone all the time can do this to you. I have had this prob, but i just thought i don't want to be a heartless person so i changed my self and asked for forgiveness from everyone i effected. I will pray for you, i know if you don't believe it seems useless but its not its the only way to have happiness. If you do chose to pray it may not work at first it all depends on how much you are willing to change. <br>  <br>  All the best wishes.|`|JWNzoksmaa	soudns like you're depressed. don't take meds..it'll not cure your depression it will just enable it. Everyone goes through depression some time in their lives.  my suggestion is...go on vacation.  i know that the economy isn't doing well right now, but try to scrap together some cash and just get away for a little bit.  Get away some place where you relax and unwind and be alone with your thoughts.  Make sure you do some think while there on your vacation as to why you're depressed and try to get back to the real you. <br>  <br>  seriously it will do you a world of good.|`|OgaAlpg9aa	Uv realised it n its half the job done.

And I've met my share of male computer programming sexual harassers as well as those who were respectful of women as well. Going into traditionally male or female occupations are not for those who aren't willing to put up with a lot of flak-most ppl don't want to deal with the hassles, even for the bucks. <br>  <br>  Why do men say they want equality but don't want to work in occupations that would benefit boys, such as teaching, but are low-paying, and traditionally female jobs? Why aren't more men nurses, or day care workers or home health care aides, which would all help men and boys, as well as girls and women, but are low-paying female dominated occupations?|`|V1MptCMiaa	We CAN do all the dirty work men do, they just don't want to.

I always thought I was bad at maths, but really!<br>  <br>  And I can't for the life of me imagine why people have given thumbs down to golddigger for her answer, she is perfectly right.|`|3d984205bb4d04e11f5941ec98252b01aa	I was born on March 1, 1992.

ZJkwz1B5aa	Your motivation, in general is low, and you are introverted.  Keeping thoughts and feelings to self.  Meaning self-containment is just as, or more than, rewarding than being with others.  Fairly intellectual.|`|wNJetCLEaa	Well, if your asking as a joke, then you simply check for one of two things in your pants.<br>  <br>  If your serious and asking how do you know if you have an inclination towards neither sex, the truth is you have simply been hurt in the past and don't want to go lesbian or gay, but don't want to be with the opposite sex either.  You aren't Asexual, your just hurting.|`|ga9dgpJ6aa	wtf... i am probably wrong..but isnt asexual when you reproduce without another parent or person....O_O thats really weird if im right. cuz then i dont think u could possibly by asexual....|`|TW03vN6Xaa	wow good question IDK|`|SJwRbuBHaa	your not attracted to men or women..<br>  <br>  you are happy not having sex for the rest of your life, wih another peson, but yourself.

I felt too dirty afterwards. I'm just being honest. Haven't done it since.|`|2c84cefbed58845d10844d0786630c5daa	Yes!<br>  <br>  Oh wait I'm not a girl.|`|V7ho7Ihlaa	Sure do.  :-)|`|prTLJnXFaa	uh huh. a couple times a day  ...did you just wink at me, sugar?|`|wkjncmHTaa	Well I'm a woman not a girl ... but yes, I have masturbated regularly since I was about 10.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Duh, yes.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Yes, regularly.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Most people masturbate..that would include women.|`|1d3NreHbaa	No, and i suppose ill be ridiculed  for that.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|479182125f393fcf9723202d1fa6b1dbaa	I heard about 60% of women admit to masturbating.

K4zsztkRaa	You aren't in love with him. You aren't.<br>  You are infatuated with him but you aren't in love.<br>  <br>  You don't need a spine you need balls. You just need to tell this guy that he's not worth your time, tell him it's over and then hang up on him.<br>  He really isn't worth the effort and you know that, but you still are with him. Why? and don't say your in love because it's another reason. Find out what that reason is.<br>  <br>  but dump him.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I was in almost the same situation once (there wasn't another girl until after it ended). I broke up with him by sitting him down and saying, "I don't want us to hook up anymore." And that was that.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	The best I can tell you is to simply put one foot in front of the other and never look back. Yes, it's simple; sometimes, that's the best approach. In all honesty if he treats you like that I seriously doubt he's going to treat her any different; and, a woman of the same caliber is going to do the same.<br>  The key word is patterns; some always follow the same pattern or mode of operation.|`|AKvLiwB6aa	oh sweethart...  i feel so bad for u...  an i wish i cud tell u how to stand up for urself...  all i can do is tell u is to dump the creep...  hes a worthless a hole that dosent respect u an treats u like a doormat...  but u already no all that...  an i no u realy want to leave him but cant make urself do it...<br>  <br>  i no wat ur going thru...  i was where u r now... the guys i dated were all jerks to...  they used me... an controled me...   an most cheated on me...  finaly when i had enuf...  i jus cudent take it anymore an kicked him to the curb...  somday ull get fed up to an finaly get the curege to dump this jerk to...<br>  <br>  u need to pray for god to give u strenth...  ur prayers an faith will get u thru this...   ill be praying for u to...  gud luck.. an god bless u...|`|GHd84xipaa	why would you stay with such a BOY.you can do better.you need some one who will love you not use you for a booty call.also you may catch something from him if you are not using protection.you really need to think about your self,because he is being self fish.|`|AA12219135	There is one true guideline here.<br>  <br>  You can not truly love someone else until you love yourself properly.<br>  Anything short of that is not true love.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	I know exactly how you feel. I'n in the same boat and I'm old enough to know better. You start by saying you are not available when he  calls . Just, I'm sorry, I'm not available right now or sorry, i'm not available then, Then go to a movie or even to the closest coffee shop so you are not there when he shows up, which you know he will. then, stop accepting his calls. He will get the hint after a few weeks. then purposly find another man and go places where he might see you. <br>  I have it harder, because I work at the gas station where he fills up his work vehicle and he comes in and says' Hi Babe. I missed you.'  all the t ime|`|2TavF36Daa	This will be the hardest thing you have ever done, but if you don't do it, you will not be able to move on to another stage of your life.<br>  <br>  In the next stage you will be stronger. You will be wiser. You will know and recognize potential friends and mates based on their character.<br>  <br>  Keep your mind on the future, and the hope of finding the person who will treat you with the respect and love you deserve.  This must be your focal point, in order to move past the pain.<br>  <br>  Now, you must pray for the strength to walk away from this man. Then do it. Don't go where he goes. Don't answer his calls. Don't allow your mind to dwell on him.<br>  <br>  GET UP, AND MOVE ON. OTHERS HAVE DONE IT SO CAN YOU.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	In my humble opinion - having been in a similar situation over the last two years - there is absolutely nothing you can do except finish with him and never, ever see him again.<br>  <br>  Ever.<br>  <br>  You must make him detest you if necessary so even if you can't finish it then he will.<br>  <br>  After that you will cry buckets for a while but time will heal and you will wake up one day and have gotten over it.|`|bGNjkFlkaa	Contrary to Nataly's beliefs, you are not better than him, nor is anyone.  Just tell him how you feel and leave it at that.  Don't go to him, don't call him; wait for him to contact you.  If he is going to realize what he's doing and if he cares, he'll stop doing it.  If he doesn't stop, then move on.  You don't deserve to be treated like a dog.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Emily|`|WQlNNHuXaa	Well firstly STOP saying that to yourself that you love him. Your emotions are in a very heightened place. Secondly, I would say to just cut him out of your life. He is harming you and doesn't care. That is not a nice man. You don't keep friends like that do you?|`|8GW80mf1aa	You deserve every bit of it. They're plenty more guys that would treat you right but instead you decide to stick with the one that doesn't care about you, so you deserve every bit of it.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	You are way better than him. Think about all of the ways you are so much better than him and how he never deserved you. You could get a guy a looooooooot better.|`|WkLJI40baa	He is getting what he wants out of the relationship, why would he change. It is up to you to leave.|`|3OH6rbmGaa	hey im a guy but if thats all he wants get rid of him a guy is supposed to like a girl for who they are and you got to start from there you dont need that guy hes probably only in your relation ship for sex and nothing else
