buHzPMHZaa	Methanol is an additive used to improve burn performance. Adding it beyond optimum can cause pre-ignition, which will kill performance of the engine, and possibly damage the engine. Under-injecting methanol isn't so harmful, but the improvement in fuel burn will be limited.|`|npBCankMaa	methanol is part of the catalyst (along with a caustic) to convert vegetable oil to biodiesel.  IT IS NOT added to biodiesel to make it burn better of anything like that.<br>  <br>  Look up transesterification process.|`|0KmJwYunaa	Methanol is used to disperse the NaOH so that the NaOH does not turn all of an oil molecule into soap (glycerin) but just a section in the middle leaving two esters of shorter chain length.    <br>  <br>  In properly prepared bio-diesel, the methanol is removed in the washing process as like all alcohols, methanol has an affinity for water.   In commercial bio-diesel production, it is recovered for reuse.   If there are any methanol left in the fuel, it is corrosive to the seals, fuel hoses and fittings and will dissolve any rubber in the system, otherwise it's a source of oxygen and helps the combustion be more complete.<br>  <br>  The idea is to use as little methanol as possible while still minimizing the production of glycerin, hence the calculations that are required and the monitoring of ph level for completeness of reaction and of specific gravity to determine the average chain length of the resulting bio-diesel.   Waste vegetable oil will require more methanol than unused vegetable oil as the chain lengths of waste vegetable oil are more varied.   Think of the NaOH as the knives to chop up the oil to the right lengths and of methanol as the spacer between the knives.   You should err on the side of having too much during the reaction so that the resulting bio-diesel is more homogenous in chain lengths but remember that you have to try and remove as much as possible during the wash process and unless you can distill the methanol from the waste water for reuse, it'll cost you more.|`|Nn4To7XKaa	There is no need to add methanol in your biodiesel it will make your fuel to be more expensive. Adding methanol will improve the fuel ignition and might damage the engine due higher flash point and higher engine temperaure. Just use the biodiesel as it is.
AjPbtm7oaa	They gave him a trip to the promised land.|`|747jw9LIaa	A woman had a pet chimpanzee named Travis for 18 years. She apparently gave him some calming pills, but one of the side effects can be that the animal can go crazy. He then went crazy and mauled the woman's friend, severely injuring her face, and i even heard that she may lose her hands. The woman had to stab her chimp to get him to stop hurting her friend, and then he ran off. Police then came and shot and killed the crazy chimp. The friend is in critical condition and may not make it. Chimps have 5 times the power of a grown man, so she was hurt terribly.|`|rghk8yMeaa	k so these people in connecticut, raised a chimpanzee (travis) and he saw his neighbor wear her hair differently and attacked her. he tore off her hands (so ive been told) and attacked and mauled her face off as well. the owner saw and went into the house and came back with a butcher knife and stabbed the chimp. the police were called and travis jumped into one of their cars and attacked a policeman and the copper had to shoot him mulitple times and travis finally died. but the neighbor lady is in critical condition.|`|cfJmx87Saa	Travis was a chimp who had some Hollywood fame, and was also kept as a pet by a woman who did not understand that wild animals are, in fact, wild.  She had managed a fair amount of domestication of this poor animal, but all it takes is one situation that triggers fight or flight reactions to cause a wild animal to revert to its instinctual wilderness behavior.

When the UN declared it a fact in 2006, they relied on a report from NASA.  The scientist at NASA who wrote the report then said that the UN had removed 2 paragraphs from his report before they used it.  The first removed paragraph said that there is no evidence that greenhouse gases are responsible for the climate changes we are seeing, and the second removed paragraph said that there is no evidence that human activities have anything to do with greenhouse gases.  But the UN did what many organizations and media do when they have their own agenda to advance.  They simply lied.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	<a href="http://www.stopglobalwarming.org/sgw_tel..." rel="nofollow">http://www.stopglobalwarming.org/sgw_tel...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Also, recycle as much as you can. Check into ways of reducing fuel waste. Care about both the visible and invisible forms of pollution.<br>  <br>  ******************************...<br>  <br>  Consider encouraging a recycling program. <br>  <br>  In my area, they recycle many things : plastics, mixed paper, aluminum, tin ... If A school used a variety of receptacles for trash with each material referrenced on the outside, it would encourage more people to recycle. <br>  <br>  Some school products are from recycled post consumer paper products, my childs' composition book - 100% recycled paper. <br>  <br>  Good for the school, good for the Earth, good for the community and good individually ... It would be a "secular" thing.<br>  <br>  ______________________________...<br>  <br>  Solar panels - great idea - reduce your energy costs - average of 60 panels can fuel the average home.<br>  <br>  Green roofs - provide natural coolness in summer and natural insulation in winter. Also acts as a water filter for storm water. <br>  <br>  Recycling - in my area we recycle #1 & #2 plastics, put there is potential there to recycle the other #'s 3 to 7. <br>  <br>  Mixed paper rather than just white paper or newspaper. Alot of your products cartons you get in the store are now 100% receycled mixed consumer post. Paper products now come in post consumer recycled paper (napkins, toilet paper, paper towels, tissues)<br>  <br>  Paper from paper - not from trees<br>  <br>  Unplug your electronics at night - conserve the energy we have.<br>  <br>  Search for new fuel methods - in the west they're utilizing electicity with a valley of windmills (300 - I believe) - supplies the majority of the city with a renewable energy source.<br>  <br>  We should be planting more trees. We should research native trees for our area. <br>  <br>  Nasa did a study, adding activated carbons to the soil can turn a house plant into a natural air freshner, increases the efficiancy of removing toxins from the air. Could this be accomplished on a grander scale? It may be as effective outdoors as well as indoors. This would be nature and technology working together for a greater good, a healthier plantet, a better future.<br>  <br>  My answer to two previous questions based on a similar inquiry.

It's really funny actually.  The only thing it's going to stop is your keeping a good portion of your income for your family.|`|pexxZB8Daa	cant. even if we did stop using gas, etc. it would take 1000 years for the temp. to go back to normal, and by that time all glaciers, etc. would have melted. so yeah were in a big mess!|`|buHzPMHZaa	By not reprinting all of the propaganda that Al gore prints on dead trees. Deforestation is a more immediate problem, anyhow.|`|tHvwdev4aa	Most people are ignorant about what Global warming actually does. The current cool is just a part of Global warming and if anybody actually bothered to listen to Al Gore they would know this. The current Weather patterns are unusual and extreme. Cold summers, Hot winters, extra cold winters, extra hot summers. The weather extremes from place to place has increased.<br>  <br>  So what can you do? You can use human power as much as possible. You can recycle and reuse waste. You can eat healthy food. You can live in an energy efficient house. You can try and live an energy efficient lifestyle. You can be an example to others. You can tell your friends about all the benefits of living a better life. Don't buy or eat processed foods. Try and buy the least processed goods when possible. You can become solution focused.  You can slow down and put a little more thought in before you act. You can plant trees. You can use a composting toilet. You can use wind, solar and water derived energy/electricity instead of fossil fuels. You can eat more fruit and vegetables (particularly leafy greens), eat more animal, fish and unprocessed vegetable oils/fats.|`|cbeFe1VGaa	Well, a lot people think the debate is over about man-made global warming or just plain global warming, I however don't think the debate is over.<br>  <br>  I do a lot of things that global warming believers would like anyways...such as ; I don't drive any vehicles, I try to conserve energy, and on a lighter note, I even try to breath less (hahaha).|`|BjsrB6Qvaa	The best solution would be to live the greenest life possible. Stop littering, recycle, donate to organizations like RAN who are working on making a positive difference in the world (especially concerning deforestation), etc. If you want to know more just perform a simple google search. Piece of cake.|`|J70iEDBhaa	OK.. for starters its all load of crap. Its just another way they can stick their grubby little hands in your pockets. (just like those sneaky bastards do with the Income tax which is technically unconstitutional and ILLEGAL) Second they want you to think Carbon Dioxide is to blame... hmm i wonder why thats never been a problem for the planet before?? Maybe thats because plants need it or they wouldnt be able to produce the oxygen we breathe. (they are really playing on the stupidity of the people on this one like they LOOOOVE to do.. youd be surprised how many people dont even know what CO2 is) So now you ask why is the world heating up then?? Scientists have actually PROVEN that it is infact the sun's fault because if you look at the thermal images of the sun it is growing hotter and hotter. That is why the ice on the planets Saturn and Jupiters moons have been melting just like our icecaps. So when Alex Jones interviewed David Mayer de Rothschild on the radio (the guy who did the live 8 concert and has been making a huge stink about global warming) when asked about the melting of the moons he said it was because "saturn and jupiter are closer to the sun." WOOOOOOOOOOW! 5th graders could actually have handled that little stupid comment. So can someone tell me now how SUV's and using too much electricity are making the moons and planets melt? Come on people.. dont be stupid and fall for another bullshit ploy from the Government.. If you wanna know WHY they are trying to create a new tax and why they need the money..look at what they will be funding with the carbon tax.

cJPOs7Tsaa	Your first priority when it comes to wilderness survival in Canada is keeping warm and dry, so FIRE & SHELTER are your priorities, and of course getting the heck out of there. I'll assume you don't head off into the bush without the essentials like matches, lighter, knife, etc... Making a fire can still prove challenging, even with a lighter, depending on conditions. In wet conditions, cedar trees are your best friend. Use your knife to shave some bark of a cedar tree. If done correctly, you'll produce a nice, fluffy dry tinder. Old cattails (August/ September) can be used as a fluffy tinder as well as insulation (bedding). Also, there are lichens that grow on many conifers which burn like paper when dry. I've often had success finding dry lichen on the dead, lower limbs of Douglas Firs, close to the trunk where they're sheltered from rain.<br>  <br>  Now that you can find tinder, you need some good wood to keep your fire going. Look for standing dead wood, the center will be dry. Build your fire in a sheltered spot. A large flat rock at your back is good to reflect the heat back on you. Avoid windy areas.<br>  <br>  When S&R comes flying overhead, you'll need to signal them. So, while you're gathering wood for your fire, you'll want to gather some green leaves you can throw on the fire to produce thick smoke. I like salal for this- it's abundant (not so much in old growth forest)  and resiny, so it burns fairly well.<br>  <br>  There are several methods of building a shelter. This is largely dependant on location and materials. Rope is worth its weight in gold when it comes to building a shelter. Use a natural shelter if you find one suitable (like a large boulder you can crawl under- there's no point in wasting time constructing, when you could be looking for food). If you must get a shelter built (which is usually the case), again cedar is your best friend. Cedar bark is easily peeled from the trunk. Make a horizontal incision across the trunk, peel the bark upward until you can grab a fist-full then keep walking backwards. To tear the sheet of bark off, start walking around the tree. Arrange overlapping layers of bark across a lean-to like shingles on a roof.<br>  <br>  Now good luck with your fishing and hunting! If you don't have a gun and/or fishing gear, you're pretty screwed. Better study up on snaring, and setting deadfall traps and such. If you don't have a copy of the SAS survival guide, then get it! It's really cool.|`|SYGGh9Jdaa	Well the easiest food source around here would probably be fish! If you had a gun probably umm.. prairie chickens or rabbits o_o If it's winter I think you're skrewed unless you have a cabin or something.|`|qtHFJFvQaa	Never been lost in a forest but I always figured if I ever were, I'd climb a tree to see if I could see a clearing, river/creek or road or smoke.|`|GrImoOGSaa	Have a whistle.
