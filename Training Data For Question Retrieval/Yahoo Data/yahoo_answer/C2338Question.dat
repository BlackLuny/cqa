I put this in the wrong category, but I think it would be better under Education.      Are American Veterinarians able to work in other countries such as Ireland and Scotland?

What sort of requirements would an American D.V.M. need to have in order to work in other countries?

People with vicious dogs may be vicious too   Ohio study found that every owner of a high-risk breed had brush with law   Updated: 7:06 p.m. ET Nov 16, 2006      WASHINGTON - People who own vicious dogs such as pit bulls have significantly more criminal convictions — including crimes against children — than owners of licensed, gentler dogs such as beagles, researchers reported on Thursday.   A study of 355 dog owners in Ohio showed that every owner of a high-risk breed known for aggression had at least one brush with the law, from traffic citations to serious criminal convictions and 30 percent of people who owned an aggressive breed of dog and who also had been cited at least once for failure to register it had at least five criminal convictions or traffic citations. This compared to 1 percent of owners of low-risk, licensed dogs such as poodles, beagles or collies, the researchers reported in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence.   "Owners of vicious dogs who have been cited for failing to register a dog (or) failing to keep a dog confined on the premises ... are more than nine times more likely to have been convicted for a crime involving children, three times more likely to have been convicted of domestic violence ... and nearly eight times more likely to be charged with drug (crimes) than owners of low-risk licensed dogs," said Jaclyn Barnes of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.      Barnes and colleagues used public records to check on the criminal pasts of dog owners.  They used agreed definitions of vicious dogs used in writing local ordinances. "A 'vicious dog" means a dog that, without provocation, has killed or caused serious injury to any person, has killed another dog, or belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog," they wrote in their report.  The definition excludes dogs used in law enforcement or dogs protecting an owner or property.  Aggressive breeds identified by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and some insurance companies include pit bulls, rottweilers, akitas and chows.  The most frequent low-risk breeds seen in the study included terriers, beagles, collies and poodles.    "One can argue that choosing to own a vicious dog is a marker of social deviance because a vicious dog is, by definition, a socially deviant animal," said Barbara Boat, director of The Childhood Trust at the University of Cincinnati, who worked on the study.    The researchers said their findings could be useful for social and law enforcement workers.  "We suggest, regardless of dog breed, that failure to license a dog is a potential warning sign of other deviant behavior," they wrote.

20090304224258AAw66jS	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Could this be an actual problem or is it just me?	Alright so I'm 16 yrs old, and I have a handwriting problem. Its sort of more than that though. My writing is terrible, I've been told I write like a 5 yr old from a 100 different people. I've tried all sorts of tips for better handwriting that i've found online.    I know my first problem is that I write with the pencil/pen leaning on my ring finger instead of my middle, I have a very noticeable bump on my finger as well. I tried to change that but it was nearly impossible, when I lean the pen on the middle finger, my hand shakes when I write.   I also hold the pen like its the only thing keeping me from falling off a building, I squeeze it death basically. I think that's because I'm a very apprehensive person.   To go along with all that, I cant concentrate for $hit when writing, I'm so jittery, my eye sight gets blurry if I look at the page to long. I think of a million different things when writing, I cant focus on just one.      Could this be anything in particular? I dont want to have any problem or anything like that, the military is a little strict with that sort of thing. Thats just what I need.    So if you have any ideas on what I could do, Id really appreciate it.      Thanks,   Kelsey

20090304225928AAFFwZ3	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Will you review my essay please?	This is for a community college Into Business class.      Assignment: Write a discussion paper giving your opinion of how the current economic situation is affecting businesses here in the United States. Also, discuss how you see yourself being affected by the current economic situation. 1 - 2 pages long, double spaced.      I know the last paragraph and conclusion are a little weak, any ideas on beefing it up?         My Paper (rough draft):      The current economic conditions has placed a blanket of fear on the nation. Many people fear the downed financial markets and  the number of job losses will lead to another depression. Even though the unemployment rates are rising and the crises in the stock market will make for a difficult year it is still no where near what occurred in the 1930's.  This fear of a recession is what aided the current recession. People are afraid of losing their jobs so they begin saving their money, when they decreased their spending it only increased the needed layoff by companies. We caused the recession but we can also fix it.       Large business corporations, "big box stores", have always had the advantage over smaller, individually owned businesses. With their outside investors they have a greater number of resources to fall back on when needed. Large businesses single goal is to create a profit, often at the unintentional expense of the economy. Sending jobs overseas the cost of labor is cheaper and there is a greater perceived profit. When jobs are taken from our country it lowers the amount of available jobs, extending the amount of unemployed people. The people are now unable to purchase these corporation's goods leaving the companies with a loss. These losses are what made the need for the government bail-outs in September 2008 so they could continue making their products. The government has to get the money from some where though, mostly from tax payers again leaving people unable or unwilling to do any spending leaving us in a continual cycle.        The small business owner without a wealthy investor to finance their business pursuits depend on bank loans to start up. When the mortgage crisis occurred the banks were more selective to whom they would give loans, leaving the small business owners without many options. Small businesses that are already running are having a harder time making a profit. Society is spending less and the small businesses are having trouble staying afloat and many do not make it. Given that in a normal economy only 80% of small businesses succeed past their first year it is even harder in these trying economical times.       I am lucky enough to still be a high school student living with my parents. This leaves me with very few financial responsibilities. I am aware that this economy may not change by the time I get out of school, and I want to be as prepared for it as possible. This education will be a very important role in my future. If I want to succeed in the business world, I need to have a solid college education to be capable to cope with anything the economy throws at me.      Overall the current economic standing for businesses is not favorable. This is why education is such an important step in life. If the next generations are educated they will be ready to step up and help change the economy for the better.       Thank you for any *constructive* critism.

20090304233422AAgssFw	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Linear equations - Worded problems?	I am doing an assignment in General Maths and there are these two worded problems that I can't quite work out.. You have to work them out using a linear equation.      1. My cousin, Ravi, is three times younger than me, but two and a half times older than my daughter. If our total ages are 66, how old is my cousin?   For this one I had no idea.         2. The price of coffee rose by 20% and is now $5.40 per jar. Find the cost of the same jar before the rise of the price.   For this one, I got the equation       x+20% = $5.40      and then I tried solving it by changing the percentage to a decimal which gave me   x+0.5 = 5.40      then a moved the numbers over to the right and simplified   x = 5.40 - 0.5   x = 4.90      But twenty percent of $4.90 is 98 cents so therefore $4.90 + 20% does not equal $5.40.            Can someone please help me out with these two questions? Make sure you show how you worked it out.      Thanks a lot.

Please give feedback on how I can make it more compelling so I can get out of this ridiculous class      I am petitioning to drop sociology 100-01 because I am unable to grasp the information presented to me clearly.  I find it very difficult for me to study and understand the material.  Instead of being concrete the material is very abstract, so much that is excessively onerous to grasp the principles. My studying already at a high initial point, is increasing exponentially as the class progresses. This is to no avail my grades continues to fall, couple this with my writing style receiving marks down and we have a volatile mix. Sociology is case particularity particular for in a class somewhat similar to sociology, “Race and Family,” my writing is clearly understood and remunerated. I would not like to risk my GPA by being in a class which tauntingly exposes my vulnerabilities, that is not related to my major or educational aspiration. In the time allotted to sociology I would like to begin and start exploring independent research on applied economics. I also would like to begin evaluating investment opportunities in stocks, and penny stocks. Additionally I would like to start studying ahead for a biology class I plan to take this summer

20090304233945AAWRQKW	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Newton's Law of Cooling Forensics Question?	Hi, I have a question regarding Newton's Law of Cooling and I'm getting a little stuck thus far and need some help continuing. Here's the question:      A murder is committed and the internal body temperature, which is originally 37C cools according to the formula of Newton's Law of Cooling:      T(t) = S +Be^kt      T(t) is the internal body temperature after t hours   S is the surrounding air temperature   B, k are constants      The table gives the time it would take for the internal body temperature to cool to 35C, based on the surrounding air temperature:      AIR TEMP Ts   /   TIME TO COOL TO 35C      20C               /            2 Hours      25C               /          3.6 Hours       30C               /          4.3 Hours      Suppose that temperature is 20C:   1) Begin by substituting in the internal body temperature at the moment the person is murdered (37C), t=0 and the surrounding temperature to determine the value of B.      What I did:      T(t) = S + Be^kt   37 = 20 + Be^k(0)   37 = 20 + Be^0   37 = 20 + B   17 = B      Is this correct? I believe I did everything the right way, but I'd like to make sure.      2) Use the information from the table for a surrounding air temperature of 20C to find the constant k. Rewrite Newton's Law of Cooling using the numbers you found for S, B, and k. Round k to 4 decimal places.      Now this is where I get fuzzy. What I've tried thus far using the table is:      T(t) = S + Be^kt   35 = 20 + 17e^k(2)   35/17=20 + e^k(2)   (35/17)-20 = e^k(2)   (-305/17) = e^k(2)   ln(-305/17) = lne^k(2)   ln(-305/17) = 2k      Now this is where I get stuck. When I try dividing both sides by 2, I get a "Non-real Result" error in my calculator, most likely because of the negative sign in the fraction. Am I close or do I have this completely wrong?      I would really like to figure this out and continue finishing this problem, but I'm not sure what to do next. Thanks in advance for your time!      Homer

I'm in a writing class, and we are writing analysis papers to prove we can successfully write a thesis statement, and topic sentences and all that.  I'm just having trouble with an actual thesis statement.  I was thinking i would write it about addiction.  There is no research involved in this, so it has to be from personal experience (we have to have authority to write it), and I have both first and second hand in the subject. I'm just having trouble narrowing it down to a specific idea.   I was also thinking of doing it on something not so... heavy if you know what I mean.  I love movies and have always had a passion for them.  I think they are a way to live someone else's life, even if its just for a few hours.  But how could I turn this into a thesis statement?   Any help would be appreciated.  Even new ideas, I'm having writers block.  Its not due until monday, but I wanna work on it as much as possible so I can turn in something I'm proud of.  Thanks!

I am doing an assignment in General Maths and there are these two worded problems that I can't quite work out.. You have to work them out using a linear equation.      1. My cousin, Ravi, is three times younger than me, but two and a half times older than my daughter. If our total ages are 66, how old is my cousin?   For this one I had no idea.         2. The price of coffee rose by 20% and is now $5.40 per jar. Find the cost of the same jar before the rise of the price.   For this one, I got the equation    x+20% = $5.40      and then I tried solving it by changing the percentage to a decimal which gave me   x+0.5 = 5.40      then a moved the numbers over to the right and simplified   x = 5.40 - 0.5   x = 4.90      But twenty percent of $4.90 is 98 cents so therefore $4.90 + 20% does not equal $5.40.            Can someone please help me out with these two questions? Make sure you show how you worked it out and explain what you did.      Thanks a lot.

20090305001708AAkEcpV	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Critique my withdrawal from a class reason?	Tell me what you noticed I did wrong, give additional ideas for reasons to drop my sociology class. Thanks!      I am petitioning to drop sociology 100-01 because I am unable to grasp the information presented to me clearly.  I find it very difficult for me to study and understand the material.  Instead of being concrete the material is very abstract, so much that is excessively onerous to grasp the principles. My studying already at a high initial point has increased exponentially as the class progresses. This is to no avail my as my grade continues to fall, couple this with my writing style receiving marks down and the mix is volatile. In a class somewhat similar to sociology, “Race and Family,” my writing is clearly understood and remunerated. I would not like to risk my GPA by being in a class which tauntingly exposes my vulnerabilities. Since sociology is not related to my major or educational aspiration(finance, accounting, pre-med) I don’t see how withdrawing from this class would be a problem.       In the time allotted to sociology I would like to begin and start exploring independent research on applied economics. I also would like to begin evaluating investment opportunities in stocks, and penny stocks. Additionally I would like to start studying ahead for a biology class I plan to take this summer. Lastly I would like to apply for scholarships, and earn money through my online job.

I heard a song on the Persian radio (670 AM) and here's exactly what I remember from the chorus. It goes like this:      "Ghalbeh mani, cheh joori yeh rooz azat joudah sham"      That's the only part of the song that was repeated throughout the whole thing. The voice sounds like it could either be Hayedeh or Mahasti. But I am not sure.   Based on the chorus I gave, does anyone here know what song that is?       I really need to know. It is stuck in my head and it has an extremely beautiful melody.    If anyone gets it right, you are GUARANTEED a best answer!    (10 POINTS!!!!)      PLEASE, PLEASE let me know!   Thanks.

20090305013629AAd4kBs	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Will med school be a good idea 26, please help?	I’m currently 26 and am going to graduate with an AA this summer. I was a silly girl who left home at 17 dropped out of high school my senior year despite honors courses, and ran away to live with a boyfriend. Granted my many silly mistakes, I managed to receive  a GED and continue my education at a community college.  I am quiet interested in transferring to a University to obtain my bachelors in biology from which I would like to go to pre med ,take the MCAT and continue to medical school. I have the ability to receive strait A’s and currently acquire them in my current science classes, anatomy and biology. I have always found great interest in biological sciences. Money and respect although playing a decent role in my consideration for med school, do not serve as the primary reasons to pursue a medical profession.  I feel that I will enjoy going to work on a day to day basis, the interaction with others, consistently learning new information about the scientific field, feeling as though I’m actively taking on a role to help another individual, and the overall feeling of personal accomplishment, that I was able to successfully complete such a difficult road. I have 6 years of “Life Experience” living on my own, contributing to my determination.” At 26 I find myself with the same boyfriend also 26 whom, I have supported for the past two years, and shows no intention on ever requiring any education beyond high school which he did not complete, furthermore he shows no intent on acquiring a job.  I remain unmarried and am not blessed with the trials and tribulations of raising children.  I find I am board with day to day life and my interest are far exceeding my immediate environment. I find myself excited with the prospect of furthering my education. I presented the idea of med school to my parents leaving them in a state of financial shock; they said I am to old to make this decision now having already wasted my life as a result of poor judgments during my youth. Considering our financial status and the economy they are concerned “IF” I’m accepted to med school and “IF” I graduate, I will spend the majority of my practice paying off the student loans required to achieve such a goal. And considering I probably won’t graduate until I’m in my late 30’s early 40’s leaving 10 years to pay off loans I wont be able to reap the benefits of my education until I’m in my 50’s leaving me approximately 10 years until I retire.  And with such extensive work hours I will miss out on raising children, family and other life enjoyments. My boyfriend of 9 years finds the idea as selfish, dragging my family along such a long struggling journey. I feel like he wants me to cop out get something over and done with so he can suck up half my pay check sitting on the couch. A compromise for my parents and I would be nursing. I can settle upon this however, I don’t want to feel as though I just settled, sold my self short of what I know is inside me to really accomplish. Could I become a nurse and continue my schooling to further my career in the medical profession, will I have time? Am I to old to become a physician, surgeon, or radiologist? Should I be content with nursing? , I understand it’s a good profession. Will I be able to continue supporting my boyfriend under such rigorous training? I doubt it’s likely he’ll start working to support me.  I’ve worked at a night club for 5 years, although I had fun young, I now despise my current lifestyle. I want better for myself is that selfish? Why do they say I’m selfish?  One day I would like to have children and be able to provide them with a secure environment while setting a good example.  Years go by quick I don’t want to waste anymore please help.

It might sound weird and to me it sounds kinda empty. thanks!      You're the creation of my father's raw hands. You used to be filthy. Your walls were tainted by the deadly artistic drawings of children reflected off the the white uneven walls. Your floor covered with grimy dust that blew inside from the little gap of the shattered glass window. The spiders worked in the corners of the rusted frame of your windows creating webs from one side of the wall to the opposite wall. Your door is painted in wild colours by my hands.       You were once a reckless old room where people would pass you un-noticed. My father highlighted your walls with smoothing white paint. My father swept the grimy dust of you're now alluring textiles as he mended the broken glass that was framed by a refining blue frame. My father terminated the spiders and cleaned the webs. He replaced your door with a matching white hue with your beautiful walls.      The pitter-patter sound of the rain that bounced off your roof gave me warmth and safety. Your walls protected me from the sturdy courageous winds. Your door protected me from any unwanted entries.      My dad gave birth to you, my room.

I want to study business in the US, but I'm having a hard time deciding where to study, partly due to the very high cost of being an international student in America.    I was planning on relying on getting a student loan, but due to the current economic situation, that has become a whole lot more difficult than it was before, hence me trying to find a cheap yet good university offering business courses.    My original wish was to study in California, but it seems like everybody wants to go there, and the cost of living/studying there also seems to be higher than in some of the other states so... I'm wondering if anybody has any suggestions as to where to study and other helpful advice to a (hopefully) future student.

Hi Everybody,       Thank you for taking the time to help me out today.      I am a recently married woman who took a years break from college to help support my husband and I . Well, recently I was laid off from my job.(Yesterday was my last day!) This got me to thinking that I would get another student loan, return to college, incorporate the bulk of the bills that I would be paying during that time (about $2,400 extra a semester)into it, and find a part time job to supplement that. Does this sound like a financially smart plan considering that the economy is not the best right now and my chances of finding a job in our small town are slim?    Also, since I attended one Virginia Community College already will it be easier to attend this college? Will I simply be transferring to a different college? Also, I am wondering if the college will approve my cost of living since I have to have that to survive!         Any insight or answers you might have to these questions would be very helpful! Ten points to the person that really answers my question because I do really need answers!!!

20090305032817AAzjfYm	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What do you need to be a..?	Hey guys. Its time for me to pick my subjects for my third year at high school, academy, big school, whatever you wanna call it. Im not really sure what I want to be but am not a very active person, not really into science and don't know what subjects to pick really.. I think I want to get into being a computer fixed - like working for dell or something, going to peoples houses and fixing their computers, be it software or hardware. I already know how to resolve a few simple problems and could probably do a bit more if I really looked into it online. The way the school goes, you need to pick 1 science, 1 social subject and the rest is all varied. My school offers Biology, Chemistry and Physics. I think for the job I want to get I'd probably need Physics, but if you guys know anything... Please tell. For Social Subjects, I don't really think I need any of them but the school says I have to. We can choose from geography, history and modern studies. I'll probably take modern studies because the teachers are good at teaching so a higher chance to pass + my sister took it and she can help me. Other subjects I'll be taking is French and Computing. Im not really sure if I'd need a technical subject (Graphic Communication, Practical Work etc) since really, I'll just be using a screwdriver if I needed to get inside the computer. I can't find anything on the net, maybe im typing the wrong stuff in, but please, help me out here :) My question is: What subjects should I take to be a computer engineer

The guy who murdered Rob Knox has just been sentenced to 'life' imprisonment and his reaction was to smirk at the sentence.    Don't you think society would be better served if this animal was put down?  It would take this worthless entity out of the gene pool and it would act as a deterent to others. Maybe we should even consider harvesting his organs so that other, more worthy people could lead a prolonged and useful life. At least then his miserable existence would not have been a complete waste of time.

I have a World History poster project due and it requires you to come up with two pictures.  One of what you think the US thought of its imperialism in the pacific islanders and the other one of what the Islanders(Filipins and Hawaiians) thought of it.  For example my teacher showed us a poster from a past year of students poster.  He put a dust rag for the US point of view to represent them just dusting off the bad things in the pacific islands and for the Islanders point of view he put a vacuum cleaner which represented the US sucking everything out of their islanders and leaving them with nothing.  So I need something good like but I just cant think of anything so can someone help me out.
