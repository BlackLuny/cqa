20070616120158AAJRuPJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would you do it?	Of course, my #1 concern is having a healthy baby.  OF course it is.  But......keeping that in mind, would you try to influence the sex of your baby if you could.  Did you?  We have one boy (he's almost 4) and I really want a girl this time.         This is only our first month TTC, so I have some time, but I was just wondering if you would or have tried to influence your baby's gender by practicing methods such as Shettles (where timing on intercourse predicts gender).      I don't even know if it works.  But last time we had sex was the 13th and my OPK was + today and I'm wondering if I should have sex with my husband when he's back in town on Monday or if I should wait until next month when I can only have sex BEFORE ovulation.  Thanks.      Please no rude answers either, I am just so sick of people being mean.  I will report you.  Thanks.

Mis suegros estan totalmente en desacuerdo con el diagnostico y nos dicen a mi esposo y a mi que dejemos de estar llevando a Luciano con ese psicologo que esta empe?ado en que nuestro hijo de todos modos tiene que ser autista.

20080929175624AAUu7Zx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of the name Shaden?	Yes, yes, I know it is one of the ever-popular "aden" names. But this one is different. It isn't Aiden, Hayden, Caden, or anything like that. It's Shaden. Do you consider it unique, or just another annoying "aden" name? It's my little brother's name, and he's 6 now, so his mom (My step-mom) named him this long before this trend started. She likes earthy names (She has two older daughters--Jade and Skye.), and thought of this one, because of the shade from the trees. Hence, the name Shaden. His middle name is Thomas. So it's Shaden Thomas altogether. I won't get offended, I just want to know what people think of the name. So, basically, here are the questions:      1. Do you think of Shaden as a good, unique name, or just another member of the "aden" trend?   2. Do you like/dislike the name any more now that you've heard where it comes from, and the middle name?      More detailed answers are more likely to get best answers. Again, it won't offend me if you don't like it (It was my step-mom that thought of it, not my real mom.), I just want to know people's opinions. Thanks in advance!

I was thinking about waking him up at 8 to feed him his cereal (I know he may be cranky but after a few days he will be use to it right?)   12 veggies   4 a cookie   8cereal    (and he has a bottle with every feeding!)   what do you think? what worked for you?   9 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.

My child's father and I broke up because he was too controlling, physically(hit me a few times and pushed me around while pregnant) and emotinally abusive to me. Now even through all this, Im stilling willing to let him see his child. The problem is that I live in New York and He lives in Virginia. He is so hateful that his plan is to come to NY once my baby is born, wrap the baby up, throw it in the car, head to Virginia and never ever ever come back again. He has ZERO experience with newborns as well as children. He told me that he does even know how to change a diaper or make a bottle or burp a baby. His 17 year old ex girlfriend called me on the phone and told me that he asked her to help him raise MY child and he would take her back. He is also very unsanitary and he is in the military. Someone please tell me how and when to get custody. I want MY child to live with me and for me to be the primary parent and caretaker. I do not mind him seeing the child as long as im there. What type of custody is this? Can someone please give me more information? Thank you.
20081010124055AA0x8Nq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im pregnant, he does'nt understand, and it hurting me.?	Im 4 months pregnant now. This is my second pregnancy, my first resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. Being pregnant is not a good experience for me because of the nausea and aches and pains. My boyfriend has no clue of what happens when a woman is pregnant and when I tell him how I feel he doesn't seem to care. When im in pain he says oh well deal with it. He wants me to help him work on the car outside and to lift heavy boxes and things that im not supposed to do. He also lets his friend smokes cigarettes in the car while im in there, and he sprays his cologne heavily when around me. When I tell him im not supposed to do certain things because it can hurt the baby, he tells me "I bet I can find a girl that's 9 months pregnant and she will do it" I know what you guys are thinking already but please help me out because im a second away from leaving him forever and even preventing him from seeing my child.

20081109070126AAjAd3V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What are you supposed to do when you see a parent abusing a child?	Too many times I have seen a parent yell at or insult a child, or yank on its arm.  Obviously if a violent blow were landed, you'd have to intervene or call the police, but what about conduct that falls a bit short of that--the cursing, the insulting, the yanking?  I know being a parent can be exasperating, I know people can be pushed beyond their limits, yet there are limits to what a parent can or should do to a child in public, aren't there?  How to handle such a situation, your observations are appreciated.

20090304220436AAIuLpl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could she be pregnant or is she just trying to make me stay with her?	I've been wanting to break up with this girl for a month now, we have been together for 5 months.  We're both 15, and have had an active sexual relationship for the past 2 months.  I've always used a condom, and never ejaculated while engaging in sex (at least i don't think i have.) At first, that made me mad, but now i'm happy i never did.   I think she gets the hint that i want to break up with her, but now she is freaking me out.   She keeps telling me she feels sick randomly, and gets all depressed and sleepy and that it has been going on for about a week.  I ran this threw my friends and they all say i've gotten her pregnant, but i think they are joking around.  I don't know if i'm being paranoid, or if i should actually be worries about this.  I've never had a condom rip on me before either.   Maybe she is just saying this so i will stay with her, but i don't know.  I guess i'm obviously to young for sex lol.

Between the in-your-face campaigning, the mock elections at school, and the hubbub within our own family, my 7-year old son became very interested in the political world recently.  He had a lot of questions, many of which I had difficulty answering without bias.  Some questions I couldn't answer at all; I didn't know the answer.      Overall, I tried to demonstrate the importance of making an informed choice, rather than supporting a particular party.  It's been interesting, to say the least.  Just curious as to other's experiences with kids and politics.

At lunch time, after hes done, he wants either more or something else, etc, etc (my husband say i am spoiling him)   Anyway, i just took him off his milk bottle.  (yeah i know, a little late.  Same way with all my kids!)  Can the absence his bottle be causing him to be so hungry or might this be a growth spurt.      Thanks for any advice!

20081119114141AAyM3Q9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Im pregnant, he left me and I need support.?	I was with my son's father for about 3 years. In June on this year I moved in with him, a few weeks later I got pregnant. In my first trimester everything was okay. He treated me right aside from a few arguments. He would buy me whatever I craved and would hold me and rub my tummy at night. Once I hit 4 months, he completely changed. He started being verbally abusive to me and degrading me in front of his friends. I stayed at his house at the expense of him and his family using my car, since they didnt have one and his wasnt working. So once his car got fixed, they woke me up, I packed up and drove all the way to new york from virginia by myself. Since i've been back in my parents house, he's been the most evil person i've known. He hasnt called in a month because he says there is nothing to talk about. I try to excite him with baby news and telling him its a boy and he doesnt care. He embarassed me by putting me on speaker phone around his friends, and said that if I wasn't pregnant he would punch me in my face. He's also been threatening me that he's gonna take the child away from me. Basically kidnapping my son once he's born! Whenever I call him and try to make peace with him, he curses at me, calls me names and threatends to take my child away from me. He also tells me im a bad mother. I can't believe that im pregnant and he's treating me this way. Im not with him anymore, but I would like some support or a suport group to go to. This hurt me more than anything in my life and I want to me a strong person for my son. Can someone please give me advice and support? Thank you

Personally, my hubby and I were trying a VERY long time to conceive so when I did pop up pregnant it definitely shocked me.       So, I kept it a secret for a little while. Long enough to get a ultrasound pic. I insisted we have a nice dinner together. While he was at work I went to have a cake made with the words "Congratulations, Daddy!" on it. When we finished our dinner, I told him to wait for dessert. I disappeared, then came back with the cake lit with candles. He looked at it and said "Are You Serious?!" I nodded then showed him the ultrasound picture.      What ways did you tell your man you were expecting?   [10 points to most creative answer!]

20090304231003AAaGzrp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant, when does implantation bleeding occur and how long after should you test?	Hi,    Im curious if anyone can help me answer some questions or has any suggestions as to my situation.      I last got my period on Jan 20. Ive had unprotected sex since then with my boyfriend more than once. Im 18 days late for the period I was expecting in Feb. on March 3rd i started a very very light dark brown bleed. Like so light I only needed a pantieliner liner and even then it only showed a little bit, it was more of a showing when i wiped after using the bathroom. it lasted the last two days and now is almost completely gone. Ive been very tired lately, but so far no really obvious signs of pregnancy like swollen, tender breasts, cramps, or morning sickness.       Should i take a test? Could i be pregnant? should i wait a lil longer, if so how long? Can anyone offer some advice or input?      Thanks so much.

20090305033154AAN4Bxc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My husband and I have been trying for a baby since about the end of December.?	My husband and I have been trying for a baby since about the end of December.  Whilst going for a routine smear test on Monday the Doctor asked if there was any chance I could be pregant.  I said well there is a possibility as we are trying but did not think that I was yet having had a period at the end of January.  She did two tests that came out as a faint positive but advised us to go and do another one.  This we did but it came back negative, which was a bit of a shock.  We then took another two tests which showed faint positives, so am I pregnant?  I cant quite believe that I am.  I am just over a week late for my period, my boobs are sore and I do feel sick but that could just be the nerves, should I take another test??

20090305035823AAPonTg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Signs of labour nearing?	My contractions are currently irregular & inconsistant and it has prolong on for about 5 days now. However my tummy does a whole lot of tightening and are slightly painful as well during these contractions. I was told a sign of labour nearing is when I have a diarrhea episode, but I read in some readings it could be a very soft stool. I recently had a soft stool but I couldnt determine if it was all the iron pills I was taking the last couple of days and the bran raisin muffins I was eating that my doctor recommended due to low iron supplement in my body, but it has a very bad odor and was very dark in color (im sorry to have to be soo specific). As well as I had a tiny tiny tinge of brownish show on my underwear, almost unnoticable cause I was wearing black underwear & had to use toliet paper to notice this. Before my irregular contractions started I had lots of discharge and now not so much, so to notice this tiny bit of discharge I have some concern. I'm asking this question just has it happened 5min. ago.

But she is 5months now and seems very hungry like the milk isn't filling her up. She eats around 3 hours 4 and half ounces to 5ounces and at night before bed 6 or 6and half ounces but she wakes up twice a night still. I give her cereal in the morning and veggies at night. I was just wondering other peoples plans when feeding your 5month old. Is it ok to give them veggies for lunch to? And how much milk did your 5 month old drink? Should I be giving her more at night? She doesn't spit up or cry after the bottle is done. She is on track with weight 15pounds. My first son wasn't this hungry all the time at this age lol, plus that was 7 years ago so I have seemed to forgotten how much on everything!! Thank you so much!!!

Climbing, running, going from this to that,touching everything..etc. Hes starting to throw major temper tantrums when I dont give him what he wants or redirect him when hes doing something he shouldnt be. Hes whining and screaming. Otherwise, hes a very loving, smart and happy child. Ive read books, talked to Drs, got advice from my parents...and nothing seems to be working. Im consistent. Hes has a routine. However, I feel he may not be sleeping enough. He sleeps from 8-5 then takes an hour nap around 10:30. Thats it. Also, hes refusing to sleep in his crib. We dont like the "cry it out" and never used it. He used to sleep in his crib, but now he will scream for hours and try to climb out. My husband works 13 hour days so Im doing this alone. (I have 2 older boys 13 and 11 but dont like to make them do too much, they are siblings, not parents) Im exhausted and running on empty. I dont want to give up because I know something needs to be done or it will only get worse. I just need help/advice, or to hear others solutions and stories on how they did it. Thanks

20090305050239AAWFh6n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why Fathers has this behavior?	alright, when me and my siblings were little my mom left us. after several months my older brother, they're first born child left us too and joined my mom. after those years i strive to be the best in the family for it was all my dad needed someone who will be like him, a child who'll be there for him and to make him proud. For how many years 12 years and counting i showed him everything a perfect son will do but he was always disappointed. I tried to fix everything on his behalf, even beg for my brother to come home with us again. Eventually, my brother came home. At first i understand why my dad is acting like he adored and whatsoever my brother for he wanted to gain that trust back which he had lost and for the times he was not their for him. but for today, everything seemed to be out of control, my dad never talks to me unless he scolded me for small things and sometimes for just nothing. What he gave me he took it all back little by little. my plans like opening a restaurant business which he disagreed was being honored but now its my brother's plan with the same thought as mine. What I've build for over these years was washed in the drain just like that. My knowledge and intellect was not recognized since from the start. My efforts and my best were ignored. For just once i would like to feel that fatherly loved from him. I just cant seem to understand him. Am i not good for him in spite of what i have done for him? for our family? for everything?

20090305042839AAmW9uX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My Mate wont go get a pregnancy test done...?	my best mate could be pregnant and shes being stupid and wont go get a pregnancy test done.. bascially since november shes had unprotected sex about 50 times..with 4 different lads...she had spotting for 2 days (which sounds like inplantation bleeding) which was in december and hasnt come on her period since. her periods were always irregular and she hasnt been on for about 3 months. ive told her a few times she needs to go to the clinic 2 get tested for sti's and pregnancy but she wont listen...i text her saying were go to the clinic and she seems to make up excuses, ive told her if she was pregnant she could be 3-4 months pregnant and if she wanted to have an abortion if she leaves it any longer then she wont be able to have one. because she had sex with 4 people, i think 2 of them were a space of a week so if she was pregnant telling who the dad was might be tricky...i told her if she WAS pregnant then the scan could work out who the dad was but she just makes excuses. how can i get her to see sence and go to the clinic....

My parents on the other hand are deniable of the fact that I could actually be gay and choose to deny it. I have fallen for this guy who has officially become my boyfriend. However, last year when my friend came over we were just doing some things to each other and my mum pushed the door in and must have seen that we were doing these things in my bed. I have now been banned from seeing him, even though I occasionally still do on the weekends pretending to be with another friend. Five of my friends know about my sexuality and are perfectly fine with it, but my parents aren't as cool with it as I want them to be. I know this is a stupid question and that most people will probably say something like listen to your parents because parents know best, but I'm sure that I can't just keep on going on this way sneaking around my parents back. What should I do?      P.S. I'm pretty sure telling my parents will result in an even tougher ban on seeing him and they'll enforce it even tougher.

20090305040137AAfgqlR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Would we still get 50/50 custody?	Ok so my boyfriend has a son, who we share 50/50 with, with his mother. Im just wondering if my boyfriend where to take her to court to get everything in legal format would she be able to take away the 50/50 away from him? She willing gave it to him since they broke up over 2 and 1/2 years ago. Or would the court be like, well since you see him as a good father and already gave him 50/50 were not going to take away 50/50 from a good father.    Just a little more info. So we have him 50/50, some times more(which is completely fine!) So while sharing 50/50 he was paying her 350 a month in child support, paying half of day, 240 a month, and then on top of it the obviously diapers, food, clothes(for our house). We also send diapers over to the daycare. She (baby's mom) buys her own diapers, food, and clothes for her house. Does this seem fair that he is paying her monthly child support, half of daycare and we have him 50/50?   Do you think if they went to court we would still get him 50/50 and not pay the child support but obviously continue to pay daycare and medical/dental insurance?   (because really the money he gives her is going to her not to him)   Anyone have any answers or advice please share.    Thank you!

20090305040415AAn19c2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like pregnancy symptoms?	I've been having headaches these past few days. I'm on my 3rd day of period and it tends to be very light (pantyliner is enough) compared to my normal flow which usually lasts 5-7 days of normal flow. I've been hungry all the time and eat more than usual. No other symptoms like nausea or tender breasts but my breasts were very sensitive for 1 week around 2 weeks before AF (this is unusual for me too). I have moodswings which I don't usually experience. My husband and I had sex during my ovulation period. I've heard that some women still have normal AF during pregnancy. Does this sound like pregnancy symptoms to you?

20090305041824AAesVT9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is my girlfriend pregnant?	my girlfriend is really worried and stressed she is pregnant. the last time we had intercourse was when she was ovulating she said which was a little over 2 weeks before her period this month well now she is on her period and right now this is the first time she's ever had this but she said she her periods last 6-7 days, its day 5 and she has not bled at all not that much, its been extremely light, and she's having bad bad cramps but no blood? It's not heavy at all. She said her breasts feel "kind of sore" and for 2 weeks she hasn't been able to eat much food and really has no appetite. We're worried she might be pregnant so that's why I'm asking on here... She hasn't missed her period, theres just barely any blood involved which is a first for her and its very rare. She said she doesnt "feel right" and she is worried and I think she's just worrying herself sick which is why she's not eating. But she said even if she's stressed about anything, it never changes whether she has heavy or light blood, this is the first time she's had light blood during her period. Is she pregnant?? Are these signs of pregnancy? Thanks.

Every month I go through the same thing...think  I'm pregnant, but I take my pill every day, mostly the same time (maybe an hour or two late).  I have been on the pill since June 2005..
