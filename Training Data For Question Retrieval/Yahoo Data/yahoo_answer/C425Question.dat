20090304091943AAeO2TE	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	York Stellar gas furnace problems. Fustrated please help?	I have a new motor, new capacitor, and new thermostat but furnace wont stay at the set tempature( we have it set to 72 degrees, but house temp is 60 degrees, unless i turn up the tempature), and furnace comes on and off multiple times.      we thought it was the thermostat, but it didnt fix this problem. we are constantly having to move the temp up to get the house warm. there is always a small humming noise coming from the ents at all times.      so, there is a dial on the furnace with little movable tabs. what are they suppose to be set too?      im not paying a repair man $75 dollars just to look at it, untill i exhaust all possible self repairs that i can.      motor and capacitor were replaced about a month ago. igniter was replaced sometime in the past couple years. we even had to pay a guy, that just had to clean leaves out of it.       i do have a sofa over an intake register, sofa is 3-4 inches off the ground though.      we encountered this problem when i turned the heat all the way down for a warm day, and when i turned it up it started the problems.      the past month or so has always had a 4 degree difference in the set temp and house temp though. thus thats why i replaced the thermastat with a digital.   furnace i belaieve is 10-15 years old.      sorry it was lengthy, but im hoping i gave all the info. cause im just tired of googling and not finding the problem.

20090304091612AAOf7X0	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Any reason NOT to tap a GFCI outlet line to connect a motorized skylight?	I have a skylight going in and a line which feeds at least one GFCI outlet runs right by where the skylight is going in, so it would be easy to tap this line before completing the light well.      The circuit is 4 "slave" outlets controlled by a master GFCI in the garage.  Load is not an issue since these outlets (over sinks and outside) are only intermittently used, as would be an opening skylight.      The only real problem I see with tapping this line might be if the nature of the skylight caused the circuit to pop too easily when it rained.  I don't know if skylights like this are prone to ground faults.  Also, I already have 4 slave outlets on the master.      That being said, it could be a GOOD idea to have a GFCI circuit controlling the skylight!      Yes, the skylight could be tapped into another location but it could be difficult to reach.      It's a Velux VSE series skylight.

There are 4 mature grape vines stumps that have been sawn off to within about 1 foot of the ground. They have started to ooze sap from the stumps, so i know they are still alive.

20090227062534AAn2QRN	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to unclog a drain with dried paint in it?	I realize I am probably asking for a miracle, but I have a utility sink that has been used to clean out paint pans over the years. I think the last pan that was cleaned out had a bit too much paint in it and now the drain doesn't drain as well (not a full clog, I'd say 50% clogged). Its been a while since i cleaned the last pan, so the paint has had time to set up.      The paint is standard interior house paint (latex I believe).      I've tried things like liquid plumber/draino with no real results.      Any miracle cure?      I have yet to replace the trap or to even open it up to see how bad it is, but that would be my next step if there's nothing out there.

20090304094317AAJ0m5Z	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How can I fix a leaking pipe?	I live in a large house split up into 4 apartments.  I have the basement apartment and I discovered a couple of days ago that there is a leaky pipe above our kitchen counter.  The leak is not where the pipes come together, but in the middle of a pipe.  I am looking for an easy way to fix it without having to have the landlord come over.  He is the most annoying person I have ever met and he always tries to fix things and makes them worse.  I am not looking for a permanent fix necessarily, but something that will last a couple months to a year.   Also, since there are three other people/families here I cannot turn off the water for a long period of time.  Not to mention I do not know where or how to turn off the water.        The leak looks like when you stick a water balloon with a needle and there is that tiny constant spray of water coming out of it.  However, after the first day that I noticed the leaking, it stopped for a day or two.  Any help would be great!

20090304091835AAwB5ly	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	How can I keep the ants away?	My husband and I bought a house 2 1/2 years ago.  It is a considerably older house and we have done a ton of remodeling to it.  But here is the thing.  A few days after we purchased the house I noticed that ants were coming in the dining room, which at the time had carpet and I had never seen ants on carpet before so it was odd to me.  There was a huge line of ants.  Anyway since then we pulled up the carpet and the ants were still there, we then tore out the outside wall and thought we were going to find loads of ants because that was the wall they were coming from.  NONE in the wall.    Well, now have gotten rid of them in the dining room.  I guess because of replacing the wall.  Now, on the opposite side of the house, my bathroom and my bedroom are flooded with those stupid things!  They were not for a few months, I guess because of the winter months.  Today, here they are in all of their glory, with a line of them as long as my bedroom is.  Okay, I have three kids, one of which is 17 months, and I do not want poison around the house, But I am NOT going to stand ants in my house.  I keep my floors clean of anything which may attract ants, but that does not seem to make a difference.  What could I possibly do to get rid of these stupid ants?

20090304093509AAIyAbc	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	How do I stop squirrels from eating my sprinkler lines!?	This is bizarre.  I redid our landscaping last year and as part of this the sprinkler system was replaced.  Now squirrels are digging up the rubber lines and shredding them to pieces.  I have tried spraying predator urine (fox, coyote) around the area to scare them off, but they won't let up.      Our neighbors on either side also have sprinkler lines and the squirrels don't seem to be interested in their lines.  So it must be the type of line that was installed that has them interested.  But I can't figure out why and I don't know what to do other than dig the entire system up and reinstall new lines made of a different material.      Any advice?      (I am in Denver, Colorado in an urban area. It is definitely squirrels doing the damage because I have caught them doing it.  No rabbits or other critters.)

I recently moved into a new house but I wanted to paint before I moved in.  For the sake of time, I just selected 2 colors...One for the bedrooms and bathrooms and one for the rest of the house.  The living room is currently Cottage Stone for the Seaside Retreat collection at Lowes.  The trouble is, because all my furniture is light in color, everything just kind of blends in...I just got a gallon of paint (Silver Sage from Restoration Hardware) and thought I might use it to add some color to the living room.  I was going to just do an accent wall but now am rethinking that.  There are 3 walls that would be great in the Silver Sage.  But one wall I think would not look good.  It is better in the lighter color because of some of the woodwork the previous owners created.  So, that being said, is it ok to paint 3 walls a darker color and have the one other wall lighter?  The lighter wall would be behind the love seat and none of the seating in the room faces that wall.        Any advice would be helpful!  Thanks!!!

I'm starting some onions, tomatoes, and peppers in my basement but the temperature in the terrarium that I set up is only 52 degrees F.   The humidity is up to 82%.   Will this be sufficient for the seeds to germinate?

20090304120800AAZmDc7	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	My sink is clogged.....?	my sink is clogged and i'm not sure what to use. i don't want to use harsh chemicals because i had a bad incident with it already. can i use baking soda? and if can, is it if i used drano prior to it like a month ago? i'm just making sure no residue from the drano will cause harm or interact with the baking soda.       also... i have this black film in the sink. is that from it being clogged or is it mold?      thanks. sorry i'm a little anal when it comes to think because i got burned by drano before and i don't want to have any other incident again!
